absence. He had promised himself much pleasure from the autumnal field-sports; but in this amusement, as in every other occupation, he was too apt to suffer trifles to ruffle his temper, and make him violent and unreasonable. One gloomy October evening, Lord Robert was returning with his gun and dogs through the park, attended by a gamekeeper. He had pursued his amusement that day with very little success: everything had gone wrong; the dogs had pointed badly, and his new fowling-piece, that had cost him twenty guineas only the week before, had hung fire several times, at the very moment when the game sprang before him the finest mark possible. In short, he had suffered disappointment enough to vex the heart of the most patient person in the world, who had never in his life felt what real affliction was. At this unlucky minute, it was Philip Harley's ill fortune to cross the park by a public footway that led through the grounds. It was the first day Philip had resumed his work since the death of his sister; and he was walking in a melancholy way, carrying his basket of tools, with his eyes fixed on the ground, attending very little to what was passing around him, and Rover was trudging by his side, when, unluckily, just as Lord Robert came up to him, a hare darted out of some bushes, and Rover scampered after it. \\\"That is the way all the game is poached off the estate!\\\" exclaimed Lord Robert in a fit of passion; and, yielding to the influence of temper, he levelled his gun at the dog. The piece, that had so many times missed fire that day, now rang sharp and true: the faithful creature was mortally wounded; he crawled feebly to his master's feet, and expired. Philip hung over his poor dog, while he saw him die, with anguish that gave a painful sensation to Lord Robert; yet still, under the dominion of temper, he said to his servant-- \\\"What a fool the fellow makes of himself about a dog!\\\" Philip lifted the body of his poor favourite from the ground, and taking it in his arms, rushed by the young lord, giving him a look of contempt and indignation as he passed. \\\"It is the dog that used to lead about his blind sister,\\\" said the humane gamekeeper. \\\"She is just dead.\\\" Lord Robert then remembered meeting Kate and the dog when he first came home: he had patted her curly head and admired her beauty. \\\"Was it blind Kate's dog?\\\" said Lord Robert. \\\"Had I known that, he might have destroyed every head of game on the estate before I would have shot him.\\\" Perhaps, had Philip heard this half acknowledgment of error, much evil might have been prevented. The next time he met the young noble, it was with the most bitter feelings. He considered that Lord Robert had wantonly murdered the innocent companion of his sister; and all the grief he felt for her loss was turned into rage. Contemptuous words succeeded angry looks: and these ere not to be borne by Lord Robert's untamed spirit; though he felt greatly displeased with himself, and would have given half his fortune to have recalled the past, yet he would not bear Philip's reproaches. A very little provoked him to strike him, and a desperate encounter ensued. This was followed by many others; for Philip neglected all his better pursuits to gratify his revenge; he lay in wait to attack Lord Robert, and took every opportunity of defying him; till the most ferocious hatred took place between the two youths, which led to the consequences we have already seen. In one instance, however, Philip was wrongfully accused, as he never had stained his hands with dishonest practices. Lord Robert well knew that the dog's accidentally chasing the hare was perfectly involuntary on the part of Philip, who was scarcely conscious of it before the poor animal was put to death. This incident had given Lord Robert Summers great mental pain: he was as angry with himself as with Philip Harley; he could not bear to think of his conduct in this affair--he could not bear to recall any circumstance relating to it; and only the _name_ of Philip Harley gave him the greatest uneasiness. Yet he was not conscious that the whole of this uneasiness sprang from giving the reins one moment to ungovernable temper; for it was neither Philip nor his dog that had offended or irritated him; but accidental circumstances had put him in a very ill humour, and he vented his temper on the first beings that crossed his path, and, by that means, he was induced to commit an act of cruelty and oppression really foreign to his own disposition, and which outraged the best feelings of a fellow-creature, already under the pressure of acute affliction. If young people will look into their own hearts, they will find that there is no frailty belonging to our erring nature so deceptive as _temper_. Strange as it may appear, it often happens that many individuals, when they express anger, generally wreak it on the last person who would have thought of exciting it. Some unfortunate servant, or still more unhappy dependant, is made the victim of ill humour; which is not only in itself as blind and erring as it is unjust, but also brings with it the additional pain of self-reproach. Yet the heart is not always bad that gives way to its evil dominion; but it is for want of self-examination--of saying, \\\"I find myself mentally uneasy, perhaps from accidental events, or even from indisposition of body; why then should I make myself odious to this person, who is in my power, and must endure my ill treatment, when a little patience and forbearance will remove the cloud that rests on my mind, and my spirit will rise bright and unclouded, rejoicing in the consciousness of having overcome one of the most painful infirmities of human nature?\\\" This self-confession (if it may be so called) will bring mental health, and rectify the most irritable disposition. Never did a month seem so long, as the time appeared to Lord Robert Summers while he remained on shore. He parted from his noble relatives with the less regret as he longed to be at sea, to lose in active employment the memory of these errors and mortifying reflections. \",\n          \"\\\"We shall see what father does,\\\" said Oliver.  \\\"He is further off still, on the other side.\\\" \\\"But what is all this water?  When will it go away?\\\" \\\"I am afraid the embankments have burst.  And yet the weather has been fine enough lately.  Perhaps the sluices are broken up.\\\" Seeing that Mildred did not understand the more for what he said, he explained-- \\\"You know, all these Levels were watery grounds once; more wet than the carr yonder.  Well,--great clay banks were made to keep out the Humber waters, over there, to the north-east, and on the west and north-west yonder, to keep two or three rivers there from overflowing the land. Then several canals and ditches were cut, to drain the land; and there are great gates put up, here and there, to let the waters in and out, as they are wanted.  I am afraid those gates are gone, or the clay banks broken down, so that the sea and the rivers are pouring in all the water they have.\\\" \\\"But when will it be over?  Will it ever run off again?  Shall we ever get home again?\\\" \\\"I do not know anything about it.  We must wait, and watch what father will do.  See!  What is this coming?\\\" \\\"A dead horse!\\\" exclaimed Mildred.  \\\"Drowned, I suppose.  Don't you think so, Oliver?\\\" \\\"Drowned, of course.--Do you know, Mildred,\\\" he continued, after a silence, during which he was looking towards the sheds in the yard, while his sister's eyes were following the body of the horse as it was swept along, now whirled round in an eddy, and now going clear over the hedge into the carr,--\\\"do you know, Mildred,\\\" said Oliver, \\\"I think father will be completely ruined by this flood.\\\" \\\"Do you?\\\" said Mildred, who did not quite know what it was to be ruined. \\\"How?  Why?\\\" \\\"Why, it was bad enough that so much gypsum was spoiled yesterday.  I am afraid now the whole quarry will be spoiled.  And then I doubt whether the harvest will not be ruined all through the Levels: and I am pretty sure nothing will be growing in the garden when the waters are gone. That was not our horse that went by; but our horse may be drowned, and the cow, and the sow, and everything.\\\" \\\"Not the fowls,\\\" said Mildred.  \\\"Look at them, all in a row on the top of the cow-shed.  They will not be drowned, at any rate.\\\" \\\"But then they may be starved.  O dear!\\\" he continued, with a start of recollection, \\\"I wonder whether Ailwin has thought of moving the meal and the grain up-stairs.  It will be all rotted and spoiled if the water runs through it.\\\" He shouted, and made signs to Ailwin, with all his might; but in vain. She could not hear a word he said, or make anything of his signs.  He was vexed, and said Ailwin was always stupid. \\\"So she is,\\\" replied Mildred; \\\"but it does not signify now.  Look how the water is pouring out of the parlour-window.  The meal and grain must have been wet through long ago.  Is not that a pretty waterfall?  A waterfall from our parlour-window, down upon the tulip-bed!  How very odd!\\\" \\\"If one could think how to feed these poor animals,\\\" said Oliver,--\\\"and the fowls!  If there was anything here that one could get for them!  One might cut a little grass for the cow;--but there is nothing else.\\\" \\\"Only the leaves of the trees, and a few blackberries, when they are ripe,\\\" said Mildred, looking round her, \\\"and flowers,--wild-flowers, and a few that mother planted.\\\" \\\"The bees!\\\" cried Oliver.  \\\"Let us save them.  They can feed themselves. We will save the bees.\\\" \\\"Why, you don't think they are drowned?\\\" said Mildred. The bees were not drowned; but they were in more danger of it than Mildred supposed.  Their little shed was placed on the side of the Red-hill, so as to overlook the flowery garden.  The waters stood among the posts of this shed; and the hives themselves shook with every wave that rolled along. \\\"You cannot do it, Oliver,\\\" cried Mildred, as her brother crept down the slope to the back of the shed.  \\\"You can never get round, Oliver.  You will slip in, Oliver!\\\" Oliver looked round and nodded, as there was no use in speaking in such a noise.  He presently showed that he did not mean to go round to the front of the shed.  That would never have done; for the flood had washed away the soil there, and left nothing to stand upon.  He broke away the boards at the back of the bee-shed, which were old and loosely fastened. He was glad he had come; for the bees were bustling about in great confusion and distress, evidently aware that something great was the matter.  Oliver seized one of the hives, with the board it stood on, and carried it, as steadily as he could, to a sunny part of the hill, where he put it down on the grass.  He then went for another, asking Mildred to come part of the way down to receive the second hive, and put it by the first, as he saw there was not a moment to lose.  She did so; but she trembled so much, that it was probable she would have let the hive fall, if it had ever been in her hands.  It never was, however.  The soil was now melting away in the water, where Oliver had stood firmly but a few minutes before.  He had to take great care, and to change his footing every instant; and it was not without slipping and sliding, and wet feet, that he brought away the second hive.  Mildred saw how hot he was, as he sat resting, with the hive, before climbing the bank, and begged that he would not try any more. \\\"These poor bees!\\\" exclaimed Oliver, beginning to move again, on the thought of the bees being drowned.  But he had done all he could.  The water boiled up between the shed and the bank, lifted the whole structure, and swept it away.  Oliver hastened to put down the second hive beside the first; and when he returned, saw that the posts had sunk, the boards were floating away, and the remaining hive itself sailing down the stream. \\\"How it rocks!\\\" cried Mildred.  \\\"I wish it would turn quite over, so that the poor things might get out, and fly away.\\\" \\\"They never will,\\\" said Oliver.  \\\"I wish I had thought of the bees a little sooner.  It is very odd that you did not, Mildred.\\\" \\\"I don't know how to think of anything,\\\" said Mildred, dolefully; \\\"it is all so odd and so frightful!\\\" \\\"Well, don't cry, if you can help it, dear,\\\" said her brother.  \\\"We shall see what father will do.  He won't cry;--I am sure of that.\\\" Mildred laughed: for she never had seen her father cry. \\\"He was not far off crying yesterday, though,\\\" said Oliver, \\\"when he saw your poor hen lying dead.  He looked--but, O Mildred!  What can have become of the Redfurns?  We have, been thinking all this while about the bees; and we never once remembered the Redfurns.  Why, their tent was scarcely bigger than our hives; and I am sure it could not stand a minute against the flood.\\\" While he spoke, Oliver was running to the part of the hill which commanded the widest view of the carr, and Mildred was following at his heels,--a good deal startled by the hares which leaped across her path. There seemed to be more hares now on the hill than she had seen in all her life before.  She could not ask about the hares, however, when she saw the brown tent, or a piece of it, flapping about in the water, a great way off, and sweeping along with the current. \\\"Hark!  What was that?  Did you hear?\\\" said Oliver, turning very pale. \\\"I thought I heard a child crying a great way off,\\\" said Mildred, trembling. \",\n          \"CHAPTER 4. THE MAGIC RING  GROWN-UP people really ought to be more careful. Among themselves it may seem but a small thing to give their word and take back their word. For them there are so many compensations. Life lies at their feet, a party-coloured india-rubber ball; they may kick it this way or kick it that, it turns up blue, yellow, or green, but always coloured and glistening. Thus one sees it happen almost every day, and, with a jest and a laugh, the thing is over, and the disappointed one turns to fresh pleasure, lying ready to his hand. But with those who are below them, whose little globe is swayed by them, who rush to build star-pointing alhambras on their most casual word, they really ought to be more careful. In this case of the circus, for instance, it was not as if we had led up to the subject. It was they who began it entirely--prompted thereto by the local newspaper. \\\"What, a circus!\\\" said they, in their irritating, casual way: \\\"that would be nice to take the children to. Wednesday would be a good day. Suppose we go on Wednesday. Oh, and pleats are being worn again, with rows of deep braid,\\\" etc. What the others thought I know not; what they said, if they said anything, I did not comprehend. For me the house was bursting, walls seemed to cramp and to stifle, the roof was jumping and lifting. Escape was the imperative thing--to escape into the open air, to shake off bricks and mortar, and to wander in the unfrequented places of the earth, the more properly to take in the passion and the promise of the giddy situation. Nature seemed prim and staid that day, and the globe gave no hint that it was flying round a circus ring of its own. Could they really be true, I wondered, all those bewildering things I had heard tell of circuses? Did long-tailed ponies really walk on their hind-legs and fire off pistols? Was it humanly possible for clowns to perform one-half of the bewitching drolleries recorded in history? And how, oh, how dare I venture to believe that, from off the backs of creamy Arab steeds, ladies of more than earthly beauty discharged themselves through paper hoops? No, it was not altogether possible, there must have been some exaggeration. Still, I would be content with very little, I would take a low percentage--a very small proportion of the circus myth would more than satisfy me. But again, even supposing that history were, once in a way, no liar, could it be that I myself was really fated to look upon this thing in the flesh and to live through it, to survive the rapture? No, it was altogether too much. Something was bound to happen, one of us would develop measles, the world would blow up with a loud explosion. I must not dare, I must not presume, to entertain the smallest hope. I must endeavour sternly to think of something else. Needless to say, I thought, I dreamed of nothing else, day or night. Waking, I walked arm-in-arm with a clown, and cracked a portentous whip to the brave music of a band. Sleeping, I pursued--perched astride of a coal-black horse--a princess all gauze and spangles, who always managed to keep just one unattainable length ahead. In the early morning Harold and I, once fully awake, cross-examined each other as to the possibilities of this or that circus tradition, and exhausted the lore long ere the first housemaid was stirring. In this state of exaltation we slipped onward to what promised to be a day of all white days--which brings me right back to my text, that grown-up people really ought to be more careful. I had known it could never really be; I had said so to myself a dozen times. The vision was too sweetly ethereal for embodiment. Yet the pang of the disillusionment was none the less keen and sickening, and the pain was as that of a corporeal wound. It seemed strange and foreboding, when we entered the breakfast-room, not to find everybody cracking whips, jumping over chairs, and whooping in ecstatic rehearsal of the wild reality to come. The situation became grim and pallid indeed, when I caught the expressions \\\"garden-party\\\" and \\\"my mauve tulle,\\\" and realised that they both referred to that very afternoon. And every minute, as I sat silent and listened, my heart sank lower and lower, descending relentlessly like a clock-weight into my boot soles. Throughout my agony I never dreamed of resorting to a direct question, much less a reproach. Even during the period of joyful anticipation some fear of breaking the spell had kept me from any bald circus talk in the presence of them. But Harold, who was built in quite another way, so soon as he discerned the drift of their conversation and heard the knell of all his hopes, filled the room with wail and clamour of bereavement. The grinning welkin rang with \\\"Circus!\\\" \\\"Circus!\\\" shook the window-panes; the mocking walls re-echoed \\\"Circus!\\\" Circus he would have, and the whole circus, and nothing but the circus. No compromise for him, no evasions, no fallacious, unsecured promises to pay. He had drawn his cheque on the Bank of Expectation, and it had got to be cashed then and there; else he would yell, and yell himself into a fit, and come out of it and yell again. Yelling should be his profession, his art, his mission, his career. He was qualified, he was resolute, and he was in no hurry to retire from the business. The noisy ones of the world, if they do not always shout themselves into the imperial purple, are sure at least of receiving attention. If they cannot sell everything at their own price, one thing--silence--must, at any cost, be purchased of them. Harold accordingly had to be consoled by the employment of every specious fallacy and base-born trick known to those whose doom it is to handle children. For me their hollow cajolery had no interest, I could pluck no consolation out of their bankrupt though prodigal pledges. I only waited till that hateful, well-known \\\"Some other time, dear!\\\" told me that hope was finally dead. Then I left the room without any remark. It made it worse--if anything could--to hear that stale, worn-out old phrase, still supposed by those dullards to have some efficacy. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
