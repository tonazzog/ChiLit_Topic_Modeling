The weather was again fine, and the sun shining brightly, and Ready turned out Nanny and her progeny.  They had an excellent breakfast of fried fish, and then Mr Seagrave, Ready, and William went out to their work: the two first took down the tents, and spread the canvas on the ground, that it might be well dried, while William went in pursuit of the fowls, which had not been seen for a day or two.  After half-an-hour's search in the cocoa-nut grove, he heard the cock crow, and soon afterwards found them all.  He threw them some split peas, which he had brought with him.  They were hungry enough and followed him home to the house, where he left them and went to join Ready and his father. \\\"William,\\\" said Ready, \\\"I think, now that we have spread out the tents, we will, if Mr Seagrave approves, all set to at once and knock up a fowl-house; it won't be more than a day's job, and then the creatures will have a home.  There are four very thick cocoa-nut trees close to the house; we will build it under them; it will be a good job over.\\\" Mr Seagrave assented, and they set immediately to work.  There were many thin poles left, the tops of the cocoa-nut trees which had been cut down to build the house; these they nailed to the trunks of the four trees, so as to make a square, and then they ran up rafters for a pitched roof. \\\"Now, sir, this is only rough work; we will first put up a perch or two for them, and then close in the side, and thatch the roof with cocoa-nut branches; but there's Juno taking in the dinner, so we'll finish it afterwards.\\\" After their meal the work was renewed; Mr Seagrave collected the branches while William and Ready worked upon the sides and roof, and before the evening closed in, the fowl-house was complete.  William enticed the fowls down to it with some more split peas, and then walked away. \\\"Now, sir, the creatures will soon find their way in; and by and by, when I have time, I'll make a door to the entrance.\\\" \\\"And now,\\\" said William, \\\"I think we had better roll up the canvas of the tents; we have had a splendid day, and may not be so fortunate to-morrow.\\\" \\\"Very true; we will get them housed, and stow them away under the bed-places; there is plenty of room.\\\"  By the time that they had folded up the canvas, and William had brought in Nanny and the kids, the sun had set, and they went into the house.  Ready was requested to go on with his history, which he did as follows:-- \\\"I said last night that I determined to run away from school and go to sea, but I did not tell you how I managed it.  I had no chance of getting out of the school unperceived, except after the boys were all put to bed.  The room that I slept in was at the top of the house--the doors I knew were all locked; but there was a trap-door which led out on the roof, fastened by a bolt inside, and a ladder leading up to it; and I determined that I would make my escape by that way.  As soon as all the other boys were fast asleep, I arose and dressed myself very quietly, and then left the room. \\\"The moon shone bright, which was lucky for me, and I gained the trap-door without any noise.  I had some difficulty in forcing it up, as it was heavy for a boy of my age; but I contrived to do so at last, and gained the roof of the house.  I then began looking about me, to see how I was to get to the ground, and after walking to and fro several times, I decided that I could slip down by a large water-pipe; it was so far detached from the bricks, that I could get my small fingers round it.  I climbed over the parapet, and, clinging to the pipe firmly with my hands and knees, I slid down, and arrived at the bottom in safety.\\\" \",\n          \" After Alfred's return from the fort, a few days passed away without any incident: Martin had paid a visit to Malachi Bone, who had promised that he would be on the look-out and would give immediate information and assistance in case of any hostile measures on the part of the Indians. He told Martin, that in a few days he would discover what had taken place and what might be looked forward to. When Martin returned with his communication, Alfred was satisfied, and did not acquaint any body except his brother Henry with the information which he had received from Captain Sinclair. The monotony of their life was, however, broken in upon by the arrival of a corporal from the fort, who was the bearer of the first dispatches which they had received since their arrival at the settlement. Letters, yes letters, not only from Quebec but from England, were announced. The whole house was in confusion, all crowding round Mr. Campbell while he unsealed the large packet. First a bundle of English newspapers from the Governor of Quebec--these were laid aside; a letter from Mr. Campbell's agent at Quebec--this was on business and could wait his leisure; then the letters from England--two long, well-filled double letters from Miss Paterson to Mary and Emma; another from Mr. Campbell's agent in England, and a large one on foolscap with \\\"On His Majesty's Service,\\\" directed to Mr. Alfred Campbell. Each party seized upon their letters, and hastened on one side with them. Mrs. Campbell being the only one who had no correspondent, anxiously watched the countenance of Alfred, who, after a hasty glance, cried out, \\\"I am confirmed to my rank, my dear mother; I am a lieutenant in his Majesty's service--huzza! Here's a letter inclosed from Captain Lumley; I know his handwriting.\\\" Alfred received the congratulations of the whole party, handed the official letter to his mother, and then commenced the perusal of the one from Captain Lumley. After a short silence, during which they were all occupied with their correspondence, Mr. Campbell said, \\\"I also have good news to communicate to you; Mr. H. writes to me to say, that Mr. Douglas Campbell, on finding the green-houses and hot-houses so well stocked, considered that he was bound to pay for the plants; that they have been valued at seven hundred pounds, and that he has paid that money into my agent's hands. This is extremely liberal of Mr. Douglas Campbell, and I certainly did not expect, as I found plants there on my taking possession, that I was entitled to any remuneration for what I left. However, I am too poor to refuse his offer from any feelings of delicacy, and shall therefore write and thank him for his generous behavior.\\\" Alfred had read the letter from Captain Lumley, which made him very thoughtful. The fact was, his promotion and the observations in Captain Lumley's letter had brought back all his former regret at having quitted the service, and he was very melancholy in consequence; but as his cousins read their letters aloud, he gradually recovered his spirits. At last, all the letters were read, and then the newspapers were distributed. No more work was done that day, and in the evening they all sat round the kitchen fire and talked over the intelligence they had received until long after their usual time of retiring to bed. \\\"I have been thinking, my dear Emily,\\\" said Mr. Campbell, the next morning before they quitted their sleeping-room, \\\"what a very seasonable supply of money this will be. My funds, as you have seen by the account of my Quebec agent, were nearly exhausted, and we have many things yet to procure. We shall require horses next year, and we must increase our stock in every way; indeed, if we could have another man or two, it would be very advantageous, as the sooner we clear the ground, the sooner we shall be independent.\\\" \",\n          \"     Pitch thy behaviour low, thy projects high,        So shalt thou humble and magnanimous be;      Sink not in spirit; who aimeth at the sky        Shoots higher much than he that means a tree.          A grain of glory mixed with humbleness,          Cures both a fever and lethargicness.                                              HERBERT.  \\u201cNorman, do you feel up to a long day\\u2019s work?\\u201d said Dr. May, on the following morning. \\u201cI have to set off after breakfast to see old Mrs. Gould, and to be at Abbotstoke Grange by twelve; then I thought of going to Fordholm, and getting Miss Cleveland to give us some luncheon--there are some poor people on the way to look at; and that girl on Far-view Hill; and there\\u2019s another place to call in at coming home. You\\u2019ll have a good deal of sitting in the carriage, holding Whitefoot, so if you think you shall be cold or tired, don\\u2019t scruple to say so, and I\\u2019ll take Adams to drive me.\\u201d \\u201cNo, thank you,\\u201d said Norman briskly. \\u201cThis frost is famous.\\u201d \\u201cIt will turn to rain, I expect--it is too white,\\u201d said the doctor, looking out at the window. \\u201cHow will you get to Cocksmoor, good people?\\u201d \\u201cEthel won\\u2019t believe it rains unless it is very bad,\\u201d said Richard. Norman set out with his father, and prosperously performed the expedition, arriving at Abbotstoke Grange at the appointed hour. \\u201cHa!\\u201d said the doctor, as the iron gates of ornamental scrollwork were swung back, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a considerable change in this place since I was here last. Well kept up indeed! Not a dead leaf left under the old walnuts, and the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen gardeners rolling it every day.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the drive,\\u201d said Norman, \\u201cmore like a garden walk than a road! But oh! what a splendid cedar!\\u201d \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it! I remember that as long as I remember anything. All this fine rolling of turf, and trimming up of the place, does not make much difference to you, old fellow, does it? You don\\u2019t look altered since I saw you last, when old Jervis was letting the place go to rack and ruin. So they have a new entrance--very handsome conservatory--flowers--the banker does things in style. There,\\u201d as Norman helped him off with his plaid, \\u201cwrap yourself up well, don\\u2019t get cold. The sun is gone in, and I should not wonder if the rain were coming after all. I\\u2019ll not be longer than I can help.\\u201d Dr. May disappeared from his son\\u2019s sight through the conservatory, where, through the plate-glass, the exotics looked so fresh and perfumy, that Norman almost fancied that the scent reached him. \\u201cHow much poor Margaret would enjoy one of those camellias,\\u201d thought he, \\u201cand these people have bushels of them for mere show. If I were papa, I should be tempted to be like Beauty\\u2019s father, and carry off one. How she would admire it!\\u201d Norman had plenty of time to meditate on the camellias, and then to turn and speculate on the age of the cedar, whether it could have been planted by the monks of Stoneborough Abbey, to whom the Grange had belonged, brought from Lebanon by a pilgrim, perhaps; and then he tried to guess at the longevity of cedars, and thought of asking Margaret, the botanist of the family. Then he yawned, moved the horse a little about, opined that Mr. Rivers must be very prosy, or have some abstruse complaint, considered the sky, and augured rain, buttoned another button of his rough coat, and thought of Miss Cleveland\\u2019s dinner. Then he thought there was a very sharp wind, and drove about till he found a sheltered place on the lee side of the great cedar, looked up at it, and thought it would be a fine subject for verses, if Mr. Wilmot knew of it, and then proceeded to consider what he should make of them. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Document\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5840,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"uttermost farthing mouth twitch mustache send case wait evening appear escort want undivided attention few minute year understand pay tremendous compliment brown one thanks wait execute rhyme reason cover invite send note ask statement true convinced occasion adhere truth drink virtuous expression fear understand flaw character perpetrate howling injustice reputation injure disgrace keen regard honor lick apiece portion word replace cane flung write charge waste paper basket cover situation variation normal useful late life abnormal remind pile paper shelf borrow harm read open smell tobacco prep evening usual night amazing night thank sir swear pray night cut flick collar low shelf bag next gating impot beastly question settle nature interview improve ruffle plume note one blue emotion nose sweat compensate imperial favore astonished hold material fact guilty god offend malignant disposition untrustworthy character pernicious revolutionary influence abandon devil wilfulness pride intolerable conceit care careful careful hurt inflict wait suffocate week royal selve wait match own part wait pad pavilion stand ready score window bench said ask private private bench wish afternoon yawn lodge chase hem length breadth cover match rot collare poacher \",\n          \"strike lady usual silk rustle drive pause horse raise humoring nonsense groom stand draw fix rein tight intolerable jerk bit idea moment rein terret order shorten opportunity rear nose hit hat knock groom throw leg fly match plunging rear kick desperate manner kick carriage pole fall severe blow near quarter further mischief flat prevent struggle same unbuckle black horse winch unscrew carriage pole cut trace unhitch footmen winch bring knife groom free carriage lead box excite happen kick rear sure stand angry sore leg strain terret saddle power miserable inclined kick first person lead groom deal knock bruise order moment confound check rein mischief master vex woman husband rule course servant wash duchess garden party help place hock kick swell painful order spong hot lotion learn happen blame mistress reply future prefer receive order lordship same stand horse judge carriage well bruise young son like sure hunter oblige carriage fresh partner tight rein ask bear bear shorten life shorten stick \",\n          \"stormy autumn master long journey business dog cart master like dog cart light high wheel deal rain wind high blow dry road shower toll bar low wooden bridge river bank high bridge rise level middle river woodwork plank substantial rail side person mind gate river rise fear night many meadow low part road knee bottom master drive matter town course bait master business engage long start home afternoon wind high master storm skirt wood branch sway twig rush sound terrible wish wood master sir awkward branch word mouth groan crack split sound tear crash oak tear root fall road frighten believe tremble course bring jump moment near touch master sir drive crossway mile wooden bridge late horse fresh crossroad bridge dark middle happen flood master pace moment foot touch first part bridge sure wrong dead master touch whip stir sharp cut jump wrong sir spring dog cart lead beauty matter course bridge safe toll gate side toss torch mad cry matter shout master bridge middle part river \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
