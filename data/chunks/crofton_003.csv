"CHAPTER 3. MICHAELMAS-DAY COME. Hugh was about to ask his mother, again and again during their walk, why Mr Tooke let him go to Crofton before he was ten; but Mrs Proctor was grave and silent; and though she spoke kindly to him now and then, she did not seem disposed to talk.  At last they were in the Temple Garden; and they sat down where there was no one to overhear them; and then Hugh looked up at his mother.  She saw, and told him, what it was that he wanted to ask. ""It is on account of the little boys themselves,"" said she, ""that Mr Tooke does not wish to have them very young, now that there is no kind lady in the house who could be like a mother to them."" ""But there is Mrs Watson.  Phil has told me a hundred things about Mrs Watson."" ""Mrs Watson is the housekeeper.  She is careful, I know, about the boys' health and comfort; but she has no time to attend to the younger ones, as Mrs Tooke did,--hearing their little troubles, and being a friend to them like their mothers at home."" ""There is Phil--"" ""Yes.  You will have Phil to look to.  But neither Phil, nor any one else, can save you from some troubles you are likely to have from being the youngest."" ""Such as Mr Tooke told me his boy had;--being put on the top of a high wall, and plagued when he was tired: and all that.  I don't think I should much mind those things."" ""So we hope, and so we believe.  Your fault is not cowardice--"" Mrs Proctor so seldom praised anybody that her words of esteem went a great way.  Hugh first looked up at her, and then down on the grass,-- his cheeks glowed so.  She went on-- ""You have faults,--faults which give your father and me great pain; and though you are not cowardly about being hurt in your body, you sadly want courage of a better kind,--courage to mend the weakness of your mind.  You are so young that we are sorry for you, and mean to send you where the example of other boys may give you the resolution you want so much."" ""All the boys learn their lessons at Crofton,"" observed Hugh. ""Yes; but not by magic.  They have to give their minds to their work. You will find it painful and difficult to learn this, after your idle habits at home.  I give you warning that you will find it much more difficult than you suppose; and I should not wonder if you wish yourself at home with Miss Harold many times before Christmas."" Mrs Proctor was not unkind in saying this.  She saw that Hugh was so delighted about going that nothing would depress his spirits, and that the chief fear was his being disappointed and unhappy when she should be far away.  It might then be some consolation to him to remember that she was aware of what he would have to go through.  He now smiled, and said he did not think he should ever wish to say his lessons to Miss Harold as long as he lived.  Then it quickly passed through his mind that, instead of the leads and the little yard, there would be the playground; and instead of the church bells, the rooks; and instead of Susan, with her washing and combing, and scolding and kissing, there would be plenty of boys to play with.  As he thought of these things, he started up, and toppled head over heels on the grass, and then was up by his mother's side again, saying that he did not care about anything that was to happen at Crofton;--he was not afraid,--not even of the usher, though Phil could not bear him. ""If you can bring yourself to learn your lessons well,"" said his mother, ""you need not fear the usher.  But remember it depends upon that.  You will do well enough in the playground, I have no doubt."" After this, there was only to settle the time that was to pass--the weeks, days, and hours before Michaelmas-day; and whether these weeks and days should be employed in preparing for Crofton under Miss Harold, or whether he should take his chance there unprepared as he was.  Mrs Proctor saw that his habits of inattention were so fixed, and his disgust at lessons in the parlour so strong, that she encouraged his doing no lessons in the interval.  Hugh would have said beforehand that three weeks' liberty to read voyages and travels, and play with Harry, would have made him perfectly happy; but he felt that there was some disgrace mixed up with his holiday, and that everybody would look upon him with a sort of pity, instead of wishing him joy; and this spoiled his pleasure a good deal.  When he came home from his walk, Agnes thought he looked less happy than when he went out; and she feared his spirits were down about Crofton. His spirits were up and down many times during the next three weeks.  He thought these weeks would never be over.  Every day dragged on more slowly than the last; at every meal he was less inclined to eat; and his happiest time was when going to bed, because he was a day nearer Crofton.  His mother, foreseeing just what happened, wished to have kept the news from him till within a week of his departure, and had agreed with Mr Proctor that it should be so.  But Mr Proctor hated secrets, and, as we see, let it out immediately. At last, the day came;--a warm, sunny, autumn day, on which any one might have enjoyed the prospect of a drive into the country.  The coach was to set off from an inn in Fleet Street, at noon, and would set Hugh down at his uncle's door in time for dinner, the distance being twenty-eight miles.  His uncle's house was just two miles from the school.  Phil would probably be there to meet his brother, and take him to Crofton in the afternoon. How to get rid of the hours till noon was the question.  Hugh had had everything packed up, over which he had any control, for some days.  He had not left himself a plaything of those which he might carry: and it frightened him that his mother did not seem to think of packing his clothes till after breakfast this very morning.  When she entered his room for the purpose, he was fidgeting about, saying to himself that he should never be ready.  Agnes came with her mother, to help: but before the second shirt was laid in the box, she was in tears and had to go away; for every one in the house was in the habit of hiding tears from Mrs Proctor, who rarely shed them herself, and was known to think that they might generally be suppressed, and should be so. As Hugh stood beside her, handing stockings and handkerchiefs, to fill up the corners of the box, she spoke as she might not have done if they had not been alone.  She said but a few words; but Hugh never forgot them. ""You know, my dear,"" said she, ""that I do not approve of dwelling upon troubles.  You know I never encourage my children to fret about what cannot be helped."" There was nothing in the world that Hugh was more certain of than this. ""And yet I tell you,"" she continued, ""that you will not be nearly so happy at Crofton as you expect--at least, at first.  It grieves me to see you so full of expectation--"" ""Does it indeed, mother?"" ""It does indeed.  But my comfort is--"" ""You think I can bear it,"" cried Hugh, holding up his head.  ""You think I can bear anything."" ""I think you are a brave boy, on the whole.  But that is not the comfort I was speaking of; for there is a world of troubles too heavy for the bravery of a thoughtless child, like you.  My comfort is, my dear, that you know where to go for strength when your heart fails you.  You will be away from your father and me; but a far wiser and kinder parent will be always with you.  If I were not sure that you would continually open your heart to Him, I could not let you go from me."" ""I will--I always do,"" said Hugh, in a low voice.  ""Then remember this, my boy.  If you have that help, _you must not fail_.  Knowing that you have that help, I expect of you that you do your own duty, and bear your own troubles, like a man.  If you were to be all alone in the new world you are going to, you would be but a helpless child: but remember, when a child makes God his friend, God puts into the youngest and weakest the spirit of a man.""

"""You will ask Him too, mother;--you will pray Him to make me brave, and--and--"" ""And what else?"" she inquired, fixing her eyes upon him. ""And steady,"" replied Hugh, casting down his eyes; ""for that is what I want most of all."" ""It is,"" replied his mother.  ""I do, and always will, pray for you."" Not another word was said till they went down into the parlour.  Though it was only eleven o'clock, Miss Harold was putting on her bonnet to go away: and there was a plate of bread and cheese on the table. ""Lunch!"" said Hugh, turning away with disgust.  ""Do eat it,"" said Agnes, who had brought it.  ""You had no breakfast, you know."" ""Because I did not want it; and I can't eat anything now."" Jane made a sign to Agnes to take the plate out of sight: and she put some biscuits into a paper bag, that he might eat on the road, if he should become hungry. Neither Miss Harold nor Hugh could possibly feel any grief at parting; for they had had little satisfaction together; but she said very kindly that she should hope to hear often of him, and wished he might be happy as a Crofton boy.  Hugh could hardly answer her;--so amazed was he to find that his sisters were giving up an hour of their lessons on his account,--that they might go with him to the coach!--And then Susan came in, about the cord for his box, and her eyes were red:--and, at the sight of her, Agnes began to cry again; and Jane bent down her head over the glove she was mending for him, and her needle stopped. ""Jane,"" said her mother, gravely, ""if you are not mending that glove, give it to me.  It is getting late."" Jane brushed her hand across her eyes, and stitched away again.  Then she threw the gloves to Hugh without looking at him, and ran to get ready to go to the coach. The bustle of the inn-yard would not do for little Harry.  He could not go.  Hugh was extremely surprised to find that all the rest were going;--that even his father was smoothing his hat in the passage for the walk,--really leaving the shop at noon on his account!  The porter was at his service too,--waiting for his box!  It was very odd to feel of such consequence. Hugh ran down to bid the maids good-bye.  The cook had cut a sandwich, which she thrust into his pocket, though he told her he had some biscuits.  Susan cried so that little Harry stood grave and wondering. Susan sobbed out that she knew he did not care a bit about leaving home and everybody.  Hugh wished she would not say so, though he felt it was true, and wondered at it himself.  Mr Proctor heard Susan's lamentations, and called to her from the passage above not to make herself unhappy about that; for the time would soon come when Hugh would be homesick enough. Mr Blake, the shopman, came to the shop-door as they passed, and bowed and smiled; and the boy put himself in the way, with a broad grin: and then the party walked on quickly. The sun seemed to Hugh to glare very much; and he thought he had never known the streets so noisy, or the people so pushing.  The truth was, his heart was beating so he could scarcely see: and yet he was so busy looking about him for a sight of the river, and everything he wished to bid good-bye to, that his father, who held him fast by the hand, shook him more than once, and told him he would run everybody down if he could,--to judge by his way of walking.  He must learn to march better, if he was to be a soldier; and to steer, if he was to be a sailor. There were just two minutes to spare when they reached the inn-yard. The horses were pawing and fidgeting, and some of the passengers had mounted: so Mr Proctor said he would seat the boy at once.  He spoke to two men who were on the roof, just behind the coachman; and they agreed to let Hugh sit between them, on the assurance that the driver would look to his concerns, and see that he was set down at the right place. ""Now, my boy, up with you!"" said his father, as he turned from speaking to these men.  Hugh was so eager, that he put up his foot to mount, without remembering to bid his mother and sisters good-bye.  Mr Proctor laughed at this; and nobody wondered; but Agnes cried bitterly; and she could not forget it, from that time till she saw her brother again. When they had all kissed him, and his mother's earnest look had bidden him remember what had passed between them that morning, he was lifted up by his father, and received by the two men, between whom he found a safe seat. Then he wished they were off.  It was uncomfortable to see his sisters crying there, and not to be able to cry too, or to speak to them.  When the coachman was drawing on his second glove, and the ostlers held each a hand to pull off the horse-cloths, and the last moment was come, Mr Proctor swung himself up by the step, to say one thing more.  It was-- ""I say, Hugh,--can you tell me,--how much is four times seven?"" Mrs Proctor pulled her husband's coat-tail, and he leaped down, the horses' feet scrambled, their heads issued from the gateway of the inn-yard, and Hugh's family were left behind.  In the midst of the noise, the man on Hugh's right-hand said to the one on his left,-- ""There is some joke in that last remark, I imagine."" The other man nodded; and then there was no more speaking till they were off the stones.  When the clatter was over, and the coach began to roll along the smooth road, Hugh's neighbour repeated,-- ""There was some joke, I fancy, in that last remark of your father's."" ""Yes,"" said Hugh. ""Are you in the habit of saying the multiplication-table when you travel?"" said the other.  ""If so, we shall be happy to hear it."" ""Exceedingly happy,"" observed the first. ""I never say it when I can help it,"" said Hugh; ""and I see no occasion now."" The men laughed, and then asked him if he was going far. ""To Crofton.  I am going to be a Crofton boy,"" said Hugh. ""A what?  Where is he going?"" his companions asked one another over his head.  They were no wiser when Hugh repeated what he had said; nor could the coachman enlighten them.  He only knew that he was to put the boy down at Shaw's, the great miller's, near thirty miles along the road. ""Eight-and-twenty,"" said Hugh, in correction; ""and Crofton is two miles from my uncle's."" ""Eight-and-twenty.  The father's joke lies there,"" observed the right-hand man. ""No, it does not,"" said Hugh.  He thought he was among a set of very odd people,--none of them knowing what a Crofton boy was.  A passenger who sat beside the coachman only smiled when he was appealed to; so it might be concluded that he was ignorant too; and the right and left-hand men seemed so anxious for information, that Hugh told them all he knew;-- about the orchard and the avenue, and the pond on the heath, and the playground; and Mrs Watson, and the usher, and Phil, and Joe Cape, and Tony Nelson, and several others of the boys. One of the men asked him if he was sure he was going for the first time,--he seemed so thoroughly informed of everything about Crofton. Hugh replied that it was a good thing to have an elder brother like Phil.  Phil had told him just what to take to Crofton, and how to take care of his money, and everything. ""Ay!  And how do the Crofton boys take care of their money?"" Hugh showed a curious little inner pocket in his jacket, which nobody would dream of that did not know.  His mother had let him have such a pocket in both his jackets; and he had wanted to have all his money in this one now, to show how safely he could carry it.  But his mother had chosen to pack up all his five shillings in his box,--that square box, with the new brass lock, on the top of all the luggage.  In his pocket there was only sixpence now,--the sixpence he was to give the coachman when he was set down.
