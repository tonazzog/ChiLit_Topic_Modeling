"CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself ‘The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?’ Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, ‘Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!’ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. ‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself as she ran. ‘How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.’ As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ‘W. RABBIT’ engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. ‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to herself, ‘to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!’ And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ‘“Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!” “Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I don’t think,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!’ By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. ‘I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,’ she said to herself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!’ It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough--I hope I shan’t grow any more--As it is, I can’t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!’ Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself ‘Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?’ Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. ‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one--but I’m grown up now,’ she added in a sorrowful tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more HERE.’ ‘But then,’ thought Alice, ‘shall I NEVER get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’ ‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself. ‘How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!’ And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. ‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my gloves this moment!’ Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself ‘Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.’ ‘THAT you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit’s--‘Pat! Pat! Where are you?’ And then a voice she had never heard before, ‘Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!’ ‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily. ‘Here! Come and help me out of THIS!’ (Sounds of more broken glass.) ‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?’ ‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it ‘arrum.’) ‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!’ ‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’ ‘Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!’ There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’ and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer!’ She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: ‘Where’s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put ’em up at this corner--No, tie ’em together first--they don’t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!’ (a loud crash)--‘Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who’s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan’t! YOU do it!--That I won’t, then!--Bill’s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the chimney!’ ",send white trot lose hear mutter dear paw fur whisker execute sure ferret ferret drop wonder guess moment fan pair white kid glove begin hunt seem change swim pool great hall glass table door vanish notice hunt call angry tone run moment fetch pair glove fan quick frighten run direction point try explain mistake housemaid run surprise find fan glove find neat house door bright brass plate name engrave knock hurry great fear meet real turn house find fan glove queer seem message rabbit suppose send message begin fancy sort thing happen ready walk minute nurse mouse let stop house begin order person time find way tidy room table window hope fan pair tiny white kid glove fan pair glove leave room eye fall bottle stand glass label time word drink uncork put lip interesting sure happen eat drink bottle hope grow large tired tiny thing expect drunk bottle find head press ceiling stake save neck break put bottle enough hope grow more door wish drunk much late wish grow grow kneel floor minute room try effect lie elbow door other arm curl head grow last resource put arm window foot chimney more happen become magic bottle full effect grow large uncomfortable seem sort chance room wonder feel unhappy much pleasanter home poor grow large small order mouse rabbit wish rabbit hole curious sort life wonder happen use read fairy tale fancy kind thing happen middle book write grow write grow add sorrowful tone least room grow old comfort way old woman lesson learn like foolish answer learn lesson room room lesson book first side other conversation few minute hear voice stop listen voice fetch glove moment pattering foot stair tremble shake house forget time large reason afraid door try open door open elbow press attempt prove failure hear window wait fancy hear window spread hand snatch air hold hear shriek fall crash break glass conclude possible fall cucumber frame sort angry voice voice hear digg apple honour digg apple help sound break glass window arm honour pronounce arrum arm goo size fill whole window honour arm business rate long silence hear whisper such like honour coward last spread hand snatch air time shriek more sound break glass number cucumber frame wonder pull window wish sure want stay wait time hear more last rumbling cartwheel sound many voice talk word other ladder bring other fetch put corner tie reach half high particular catch hold rope roof bear mind loose slate head loud crash fancy chimney master chimney
