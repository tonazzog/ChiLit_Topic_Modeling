"CHAPTER XII. The End of Little Meg's Trouble It was early in the evening after Meg had gone in search of a doctor, that Kitty came home, more sober than she had been for several nights, and very much ashamed of her last outbreak.  She sat down on the top of the stairs, listening for little Meg to read aloud, but she heard only the sobs and moanings of Robin, who called incessantly for Meg, without getting any answer.  Kitty waited for some time, hearkening for her voice, but after a while she knocked gently at the door.  There was no reply, but after knocking again and again she heard Robin call out in a frightened tone. 'What's that?' he cried. 'It's me, your own Kitty,' she said; 'where's little Meg?' 'I don't know,' said Robin, 'she's gone away, and there's nobody but me and baby; and baby's asleep, and so cold.' 'What are you crying for, Robbie?' asked Kitty. 'I'm crying for everything,' said Robin. 'Don't you be frightened, Robbie,' she said soothingly; 'Kitty'll stay outside the door, and sing pretty songs to you, till Meg comes home.' She waited a long time, till the clocks struck twelve, and still Meg did not come.  From time to time Kitty spoke some reassuring words to Robin, or sang him some little songs she remembered from her own childhood; but his cries grew more and more distressing, and at length Kitty resolved to break her promise, and unlock Meg's door once again to move the children into her own attic. She lit a candle, and entered the dark room.  The fire was gone out, and Robin sat up on the pillow, his face wet with tears and his black eyes large with terror.  The baby, which lay beside him, seemed very still, with its wasted puny hands crossed upon its breast; so quiet and still that Kitty looked more closely, and held the light nearer to its slumbering face.  What could ail it?  What had brought that awful smile upon its tiny face?  Kitty touched it fearfully with the tip of her finger; and then she stood dumb and motionless before the terrible little corpse. She partly knew, and partly guessed, what had done this thing.  She recollected, but vaguely enough, that one of her companions, who had grown weary of the little creature's pitiful cry, had promised to quiet it for her, and how speedily it had fallen off into a profound, unbroken slumber.  And there it lay, in the same slumber perhaps.  She touched it again; but no, the sleep it slept now was even deeper than that--a sleep so sound that its eyelids would never open again to this world's light, nor its sealed lips ever utter a word of this world's speech.  Kitty could scarcely believe it; but she could not bear to stay in that mute, gentle, uncomplaining presence; and she lifted up Robin to carry him into her own room.  Oh that God had but called her away when she was an innocent baby like that! Robin's feverishness was almost gone; and now, wrapped in Kitty's gown and rocked to sleep on her lap, he lay contented and restful, while she sat thinking in the dark, for the candle soon burned itself out, until the solemn grey light of the morning dawned slowly in the east.  She had made up her mind now what she would do.  There was only one more sin lying before her.  She had grown up bad, and broken her mother's heart, and now she had brought this great overwhelming sorrow upon poor little Meg.  There was but one end to a sinful life like hers, and the sooner it came the better.  She would wait till Meg came home and give up Robin to her, for she would not hurry on to that last crime before Meg was there to take care of him.  Then she saw herself stealing along the streets, down to an old pier she knew of, where boats had ceased to ply, and where no policeman would be near to hinder her, or any one about to rescue her; and then she would fling herself, worthless and wretched as she was, into the rapid river, which had borne so many worthless wretches like her upon its strong current into the land of darkness and death, of which she did not dare to think.  That was what she would do, saying nothing to any one; and if she could ask anything of God, it would be that her mother might never find out what had become of her. So Kitty sat with her dark thoughts long after Angel Court had awakened to its ordinary life, its groans, and curses, and sobs; until the sun looked in cheerily upon her and Robin, as it did upon Meg in Mrs Christie's nursery.  She did not care to put him down, for he looked very pretty, and happy, and peaceful in his soft sleep, and whenever she moved he stirred a little, and pouted his lips as if to reproach her.  Besides, it was the last time she would hold a child in her arms; and though they ached somewhat, they folded round him fondly.  At last she heard a man's step upon the ladder mounting to the attics, and Meg's voice speaking faintly.  Could it be that her father was come home at last?  Oh! what would their eyes see when they opened that door?  Kitty held her breath to listen for the first sound of anguish and amazement; but it was poor little Meg's voice which reached her before any other. 'Robbie! oh, Robbie!' she cried, in a tone of piercing terror, 'what has become of my little Robbie?' 'He's safe, he's here, Meg,' answered Kitty, starting to her feet, and rushing with him to Meg's attic. It was no rough, weather-beaten seaman, who was just placing Meg on a chair, as if he had carried her upstairs; but some strange, well-clad gentleman, and behind him stood an elderly woman, who turned sharply round as she heard Kitty's voice. 'Posy!' cried Mrs Blossom. No one but her own mother could have known again the bright, merry, rosy girl, whom the neighbours called Posy, in the thin, withered, pallid woman who stood motionless in the middle of the room.  Even Meg forgot for a moment her fears for Robin.  Dr Christie had only time to catch him from her failing arms, before she fell down senseless upon the floor at her mother's feet. 'Let me do everything for her,' exclaimed Mrs Blossom, pushing away Dr Christie; 'she's my Posy, I tell you.  You wouldn't know her again, but I know her.  I'll do everything for her; she's my girl, my little one; she's the apple of my eye.' But it was a very long time before Mrs Blossom, with Dr Christie's help, could bring Posy to life again; and then they lifted her into her poor bed, and Dr Christie left her mother alone with her, and went back to Meg.  Robin was ailing very little, he said: but the baby?  Yes, the baby must have died even if little Meg had fetched him at once. Nothing could have saved it, and it had suffered no pain, he added tenderly. 'I think I must take you two away from this place,' said Dr Christie. 'Oh, no, no,' answered Meg earnestly; 'I must stay till father comes, and I expect him to-day or to-morrow.  Please, sir, leave me and Robbie here till he comes.' 'Then you must have somebody to take care of you,' said Dr Christie. 'No, please, sir,' answered Meg, in a low and cautious voice, 'mother gave me a secret to keep that I can't tell to nobody, and I promised her I'd never let nobody come into my room till father comes home.  I couldn't help you, and Mrs Blossom, and Kitty coming in this time; but nobody mustn't come in again.'
