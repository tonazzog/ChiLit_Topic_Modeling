"Juno had taken the children down to the cove, and, walking out into the water up to her knees, had dipped them in all over, as the shortest way of washing them, and had then dressed them and left them with their mother, while she assisted William to get the cups and saucers and plates for breakfast.  Everything was laid out nice and tidy between the two tents, and then William proposed that he should awaken Ready. ""Yes, my boy, you may as well now--he will want his breakfast."" William went and pushed Ready on the shoulder.  ""Ready, have you had sleep enough?"" said William, as the old man sat up. ""Yes, William.  I have had a good nap, I expect; and now I will get up, and see what I can get for breakfast for you all."" ""Do,"" replied William, laughing. Ready was soon dressed, for he had only taken off his jacket when he lay down.  He put it on, and came out of the tent; when, to his astonishment, he found the whole party (Mrs Seagrave having come out with the children) standing round the breakfast, which was spread on the ground. ""Good-morning, Ready!"" said Mrs Seagrave, extending her hand.  Mr Seagrave also shook hands with him. ""You have had a good long sleep, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""and I would not waken you after your fatigue of yesterday."" ""I thank you, sir; and I am glad to see that Madam is so well: and I am not sorry to see that you can do so well without me,"" continued Ready, smiling. ""Indeed, but we cannot, I'm afraid,"" replied Mrs Seagrave; ""had it not been for you and your kindness, where should we have been now?"" ""We can get a breakfast ready without you,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""but without you, I think we never should have required another breakfast by this time.  But we will tell Ready all we have done while we eat our breakfast: now, my dear, if you please.""  Mrs Seagrave then read a chapter from the Bible, and afterwards they all knelt down while Mr Seagrave offered up a prayer. While they were at breakfast, William told Ready how they had gone on board, and what they had brought on shore, and he also mentioned how Juno had dipped all the children in the sea. ""But Juno must not do that again,"" replied Ready, ""until I have made all safe; you know that there are plenty of sharks about these islands, and it is very dangerous to go into the water."" ""Oh, what an escape they have had!"" cried Mrs Seagrave, shuddering. ""It's very true,"" continued Ready; ""but they don't keep so much to the windward of the islands where we are at present; but still that smooth cove is a very likely place for them to come into; so it's just as well not to go in again, Juno, until I have time to make a place for you to bathe in in safety.  As soon as we can get as much as we want from the ship, we must decide whether we shall stay here or not."" ""Stay here or not, Ready!--what do you mean?"" ""Why, we have not yet found any water, and that is the first necessary of life--if there is no water on this side of the island, we must pitch our tents somewhere else."" ""That's very true,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""I wish we could find time to explore a little."" ""So we can, sir; but we must not lose this fine weather to get a few things from the ship.  We had better go now.  You and William can remain on board to collect the things, and I will land them on the beach for Juno to bring up."" The whole day was spent in landing every variety of article which they thought could be useful.  All the small sails, cordage, twine, canvas, small casks, saws, chisels, and large nails, and elm and oak plank, were brought on shore before dinner.  After they had taken a hearty dinner, the cabin tables and chairs, all their clothes, some boxes of candles, two bags of coffee, two of rice, two more of biscuits, several pieces of beef and pork and bags of flour, some more water, the grindstone, and Mrs Seagrave's medicine-chest were landed.  When Ready came off again, he said, ""Our poor boat is getting very leaky, and will not take much more on shore without being repaired; and Juno has not been able to get half the things up--they are too heavy for one person.  I think we shall do pretty well now, Mr Seagrave; and we had better, before it is dark, get all the animals on shore.  I don't much like to trust them to swim on shore, but they are awkward things in a boat.  We'll try a pig, at all events; and while I get one up, do you and William tie the legs of the fowls, and put them into the boat; as for the cow, she cannot be brought on shore, she is still lying down, and, I expect, won't get up again any more; however, I have given her plenty of hay, and if she don't rise, why I will kill her, and we can salt her down."" Ready went below, and the squealing of the pig was soon heard; he came on deck with it hanging over his back by the hind legs, and threw it into the sea over the gunnel: the pig floundered at first; but after a few seconds, turned its head away from the ship and swam for the shore. ""He goes ashore straight enough,"" said Ready, who, with Mr Seagrave and William, was watching the animal; but a minute afterwards, Ready exclaimed: ""I thought as much--we've lost him!"" ""How?"" replied Mr Seagrave. ""D'ye see that black thing above water pushing so fast to the animal?-- that's the back fin of a shark, and he will have the poor thing--there, he's got him!"" said Ready, as the pig disappeared under the water with a heavy splash.  ""Well, he's gone; better the pig than your little children, Mr Seagrave."" ""Yes, indeed, God be praised!--that monster might have been close to them at the time that Juno took them into the water."" ""He was not far off; I reckon,"" replied Ready.  ""We'll go down now and tie the legs of the other four pigs, and bring them up; with what's already in the boat they will be a good load."" As soon as the pigs were in the boat, Ready sculled it on shore, while Mr Seagrave and William brought up the goats and sheep ready for the next trip.  Ready soon returned.  ""Now this will be our last trip for to-day, and, if I am any judge of the weather, our last trip for some days; it is banking up very thick in the offing.  This trip we'll be able to put into the boat a bag of corn for the creatures, in case we require it, and then we may say good-bye to the ship for a day or two at least."" They then all got into the boat, which was very deeply laden, for the corn was heavy, but they got safe on shore, although they leaked very much.  Having landed the goats and sheep, William led them up to the tent, where they remained very quietly; the pigs had run away, and so had the fowls. ""That's what I call a good day's work, Mr Seagrave,"" said Ready; ""the little boat has done its duty well; but we must not venture in her again until I have put her into a little better condition."" They were not at all sorry, after their hard day's work, to find that Juno had prepared coffee for them; and while they were drinking it, they narrated to Mrs Seagrave the tragically death of the poor pig by the shark.  Poor Juno appeared quite frightened at the danger which the children had been in, even now that it was all over. ""We shall have plenty to do here to-morrow,"" observed Mr Seagrave, ""in getting things into their places.""
