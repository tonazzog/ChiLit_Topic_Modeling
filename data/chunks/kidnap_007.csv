"CHAPTER VI. WHAT BEFELL AT THE QUEEN’S FERRY As soon as we came to the inn, Ransome led us up the stair to a small room, with a bed in it, and heated like an oven by a great fire of coal. At a table hard by the chimney, a tall, dark, sober-looking man sat writing. In spite of the heat of the room, he wore a thick sea-jacket, buttoned to the neck, and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears; yet I never saw any man, not even a judge upon the bench, look cooler, or more studious and self-possessed, than this ship-captain. He got to his feet at once, and coming forward, offered his large hand to Ebenezer. “I am proud to see you, Mr. Balfour,” said he, in a fine deep voice, “and glad that ye are here in time. The wind’s fair, and the tide upon the turn; we’ll see the old coal-bucket burning on the Isle of May before to-night.” “Captain Hoseason,” returned my uncle, “you keep your room unco hot.” “It’s a habit I have, Mr. Balfour,” said the skipper. “I’m a cold-rife man by my nature; I have a cold blood, sir. There’s neither fur, nor flannel--no, sir, nor hot rum, will warm up what they call the temperature. Sir, it’s the same with most men that have been carbonadoed, as they call it, in the tropic seas.” “Well, well, captain,” replied my uncle, “we must all be the way we’re made.” But it chanced that this fancy of the captain’s had a great share in my misfortunes. For though I had promised myself not to let my kinsman out of sight, I was both so impatient for a nearer look of the sea, and so sickened by the closeness of the room, that when he told me to “run down-stairs and play myself awhile,” I was fool enough to take him at his word. Away I went, therefore, leaving the two men sitting down to a bottle and a great mass of papers; and crossing the road in front of the inn, walked down upon the beach. With the wind in that quarter, only little wavelets, not much bigger than I had seen upon a lake, beat upon the shore. But the weeds were new to me--some green, some brown and long, and some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers. Even so far up the firth, the smell of the sea-water was exceedingly salt and stirring; the Covenant, besides, was beginning to shake out her sails, which hung upon the yards in clusters; and the spirit of all that I beheld put me in thoughts of far voyages and foreign places. I looked, too, at the seamen with the skiff--big brown fellows, some in shirts, some with jackets, some with coloured handkerchiefs about their throats, one with a brace of pistols stuck into his pockets, two or three with knotty bludgeons, and all with their case-knives. I passed the time of day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows, and asked him of the sailing of the brig. He said they would get under way as soon as the ebb set, and expressed his gladness to be out of a port where there were no taverns and fiddlers; but all with such horrifying oaths, that I made haste to get away from him. This threw me back on Ransome, who seemed the least wicked of that gang, and who soon came out of the inn and ran to me, crying for a bowl of punch. I told him I would give him no such thing, for neither he nor I was of an age for such indulgences. “But a glass of ale you may have, and welcome,” said I. He mopped and mowed at me, and called me names; but he was glad to get the ale, for all that; and presently we were set down at a table in the front room of the inn, and both eating and drinking with a good appetite. Here it occurred to me that, as the landlord was a man of that county, I might do well to make a friend of him. I offered him a share, as was much the custom in those days; but he was far too great a man to sit with such poor customers as Ransome and myself, and he was leaving the room, when I called him back to ask if he knew Mr. Rankeillor. “Hoot, ay,” says he, “and a very honest man. And, O, by-the-by,” says he, “was it you that came in with Ebenezer?” And when I had told him yes, “Ye’ll be no friend of his?” he asked, meaning, in the Scottish way, that I would be no relative. I told him no, none. “I thought not,” said he, “and yet ye have a kind of gliff* of Mr. Alexander.”      * Look. I said it seemed that Ebenezer was ill-seen in the country. “Nae doubt,” said the landlord. “He’s a wicked auld man, and there’s many would like to see him girning in the tow*. Jennet Clouston and mony mair that he has harried out of house and hame. And yet he was ance a fine young fellow, too. But that was before the sough** gaed abroad about Mr. Alexander, that was like the death of him.”      * Rope.      ** Report. “And what was it?” I asked. “Ou, just that he had killed him,” said the landlord. “Did ye never hear that?” “And what would he kill him for?” said I. “And what for, but just to get the place,” said he. “The place?” said I. “The Shaws?” “Nae other place that I ken,” said he. “Ay, man?” said I. “Is that so? Was my--was Alexander the eldest son?” “‘Deed was he,” said the landlord. “What else would he have killed him for?” And with that he went away, as he had been impatient to do from the beginning. Of course, I had guessed it a long while ago; but it is one thing to guess, another to know; and I sat stunned with my good fortune, and could scarce grow to believe that the same poor lad who had trudged in the dust from Ettrick Forest not two days ago, was now one of the rich of the earth, and had a house and broad lands, and might mount his horse tomorrow. All these pleasant things, and a thousand others, crowded into my mind, as I sat staring before me out of the inn window, and paying no heed to what I saw; only I remember that my eye lighted on Captain Hoseason down on the pier among his seamen, and speaking with some authority. And presently he came marching back towards the house, with no mark of a sailor’s clumsiness, but carrying his fine, tall figure with a manly bearing, and still with the same sober, grave expression on his face. I wondered if it was possible that Ransome’s stories could be true, and half disbelieved them; they fitted so ill with the man’s looks. But indeed, he was neither so good as I supposed him, nor quite so bad as Ransome did; for, in fact, he was two men, and left the better one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel. The next thing, I heard my uncle calling me, and found the pair in the road together. It was the captain who addressed me, and that with an air (very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality. “Sir,” said he, “Mr. Balfour tells me great things of you; and for my own part, I like your looks. I wish I was for longer here, that we might make the better friends; but we’ll make the most of what we have. Ye shall come on board my brig for half an hour, till the ebb sets, and drink a bowl with me.” ",befell queen ferry inn lead stair small room bed heat oven great fire coal table chimney tall dark sober man sit writing spite heat room wear thick sea jacket button neck tall hairy cap draw ear man judge bench cool studious self possess ship captain foot offer large hand proud fine deep voice glad time wind fair tide turn old coal bucket burn night return uncle keep room hot habit skipper cold rife man nature cold blood sir fur flannel sir hot rum warm call temperature same most man carbonado call tropic sea captain reply uncle way chance fancy captain great share misfortune promise let kinsman sight impatient nearer sea sicken closeness room run stair play fool word leave man sit bottle great mass paper cross road front inn walk beach wind quarter wavelet big lake beat shore weed new green brown long bladder crackle finger firth smell sea water salt stir begin shake sail hang yard cluster spirit beheld put thought voyage foreign place seamen skiff big brown fellow shirt jacket coloured handkerchief throat brace pistol stick pocket knotty bludgeon case knife pass time day desperate fellow ask sailing brig way ebb set express gladness port tavern fiddler such horrifying oath haste throw seem least wicked gang inn run cry bowl punch give such thing age such indulgence glass ale mopp mow call name glad ale set table front room inn eat drink appetite occur landlord man county friend offer share custom day great man sit such poor customer leave room call ask honest man friend ask mean scottish way relative  kind gliff  seem ill country doubt landlord wicked auld man many like girn tow mony mair harry house hame fine young fellow sough gaed death rope report ask kill landlord hear kill place place other place old son landlord kill impatient beginning course guess long while thing guess sit stunn fortune grow believe same poor lad trudge dust day rich earth house broad land mount horse tomorrow pleasant thing other crowd mind sit stare inn window pay heed remember eye light pier seamen speak authority march house mark sailor clumsiness carry fine tall figure manly bear same sober grave expression face wonder possible story true half disbelieve fit ill man suppose bad fact man leave one set foot board vessel next thing hear uncle call find pair road captain address air flattering young lad grave equality great thing own part like wish friend most board brig hour ebb set drink bowl
