" The day had now arrived when Mrs. Roberts was expected; the young people were all assembled in the school-room busy with their different tasks; Selina and Leila were seated silently at their writing-desks, translating English into French; Alfred quietly in a corner, drawing birds and animals on a slate, his favourite employment. Matilda alone was restless and unquiet; she kept constantly running from the table to the window, holding a book of French dialogues in her hand, and looking out on the approach, while she rhymed the same phrase over and over again: “Il faudra faire comme nous pourrons, il faudra faire comme nous pourrons, il faudra faire comme nous pourrons; now surely this is knocked into my brains.” Selina shook her head. “Well, Selina,” she continued, “you need not shake your head; il faudra faire comme nous pourrons, and I am sure I am doing the best I can.” “Are you?” Selina quickly said, and went on with her writing. “How provoking you are, Selina; there do you two sit as quietly as if nothing were going to happen, and as if Mrs. Roberts might not arrive every moment.” “But will running to the window and shaking the whole room make her come any sooner?” Selina inquired. “To be sure it will, that is, I shall see her sooner. Alfred, do run down and listen if you hear a carriage,” and she snatched the slate from his hand; “there’s a good boy, run down and do like Fine-ear, you know; stoop down and put your ear to the ground, there’s a man,” and she pushed him out at the door. Alfred returned again almost immediately. “I could not play at fine-ear, Matilda,” he said, “for I saw the carriage at a little distance the moment I went out; listen, it is stopping at the door now.” All the three young girls jumped up and ran instantly to the window. The steps of the carriage were let down, a ladylike person, rather slender, and rather above the middle height, stepped out, her bonnet entirely concealing her face. Mr. Stanley came forward, he seemed to welcome her kindly; they entered the house together. The next moment they heard the drawing-room door close. Matilda glided from the room. Selina looked anxiously after her; in a few minutes she returned. “I have seen her trunks,” she said; “I don’t like them.” Selina looked distressed. “Well, Selina, why do you put on that sorrowful face? I did not say I did not like her. Come, cheer up, I will do the best I can.” The drawing-room bell rang; in a few minutes Amy tapped at the school-room door to say the young ladies were wanted in the drawing-room. They all went down. Mrs. Roberts seemed talking earnestly to their mamma when they entered; but she stopped, and as Mrs. Stanley introduced them, said a few kind words to each. Her face was not pretty till she smiled; her smile was very pleasing, and her voice was low and sweet. Leila felt she should like her; both she and Selina, when addressed, said something in return, and probably just what they ought to say, though no one heard it; Matilda said nothing. Almost immediately after Mrs. Stanley told them they might return to the school-room, that Mrs. Roberts was probably a little tired with her journey, but if she felt inclined by and by for a walk, they might join them in the garden. It was all over in a moment. “Well,” Matilda exclaimed, as they entered the school-room again, “how do you like her?” Both answered, “Very much, we like her very much.” “Very much,” Matilda repeated; “well, I don’t. I don’t like her at all.” “And why, Matilda? why do you not like her?” Selina anxiously inquired. “I don’t like her nose.” “Don’t like her nose!” “No, I don’t; she has a pinched nose, and don’t you see it droops?” Selina saw that at this moment it was a hopeless case; she did not even attempt the vindication of the nose. Mrs. Stanley was not disappointed in her expectations with regard to Mrs. Roberts; she proved to be a highly principled, amiable, accomplished woman, and with a gentle steadiness about her which peculiarly fitted her for the task she had undertaken. With Selina and Leila she had comparatively little trouble, and they soon became fond of her, and anxious to give her satisfaction, but with Matilda she had a far more difficult task; besides having strong prejudices to combat, she had to struggle not only with careless inattentive habits, but often with an obstinate determination not to overcome them, for Matilda’s goodness as yet only came by fits and starts; there was no very steady improvement, and the arrival of Mrs. Roberts seemed rather to have thrown her back. She had fancied that she would not like her, and she seemed too often to have a wish to act up to the opinion she had formed. Mrs. Roberts’ patience with her was wonderful; indifferent observers might have fancied that Matilda was her favourite; she spoke more to her than to the others, often conversing cheerfully with her on interesting subjects, and trying to draw out her feelings and sentiments; and Matilda, though she gave her much trouble, was not quite insensible to this. There were times when she acknowledged that Mrs. Roberts was rather a kind person, though her nose did droop. The removal to Woodlands now took place, and the following morning Mrs. Roberts granted a holiday to the young people, that every room in the house might be visited and properly admired, and also that Leila might have time to settle with Susan as to a convenient arrangement for several of her pets, while, with the assistance of her cousins, she hung the cages with the parrots and the smaller birds up in the conservatory. She had for some time been bringing up a pair of turtle-doves as a gift to Mina, and teaching a young parrot to speak, which she intended for Louisa. The turtle-doves were now at a very interesting age, just beginning to be independent, and to coo to each other in a most melodious manner, and the parrot gave proof of fine abilities, and could already say, “I am Louisa’s pretty bird.” The house was most comfortably though simply furnished; but the conservatory delighted Leila more than any part of it: the flowers so fragrant, so bright and beautiful, and the birds so happy, they were already singing in the branches. Once more she walked about amongst the birds and flowers, and felt that but for one sad thought she would not have had a wish ungratified. She quite longed to give her papa an account of all her arrangements, and went in search of him. She found Mr. Howard reading in his library, but he answered her little tap at his door with his usual kind voice. “Come in, I think I know who is there; what have you got to tell me, love?” and the book was thrown aside, and she, seated on a low stool at his knee, kept looking up in his face, and pouring out her little history, he entering into all her arrangements with all the attention and satisfaction her heart could desire. “And now, papa,” she continued, “you know I am of a great age now, I am eleven, and I want to talk to you a little about my responsibilities.” “Your responsibilities, my love!--that is a very fine word for you; where did you pick up that word, Leila?” “I think it is a very nice word, papa, and I understand it; and you must know I have responsibilities in my new home, for I heard Aunt Stanley say to Mrs. Roberts the other day, that Miss Palmer had gone now to keep her father’s house, and would have many responsibilities; that besides the regulating the house, and attending in every way to his comfort, she would also have the school to attend to, and the poor people to visit, and it was a large parish. I could not find out what a large parish meant, but I understood all the rest; and don’t you think, papa, I should have a school, also, and visit the poor people?” ",day arrive expect young person assemble school room busy different task seat writing desk translate corner draw bird animal slate favourite employment restless unquiet keep run table window hold book french dialogue hand approach rhyme same phrase knock brain shake head continue shake head sure writing provoking sit happen arrive moment run window shake whole room inquire sure run listen hear carriage snatch slate hand boy run fine ear stake put ear ground man push door return play fine ear carriage distance moment listen stop door young girl jump run window step carriage let ladylike person slender middle height step bonnet conceal face seem welcome enter house next moment hear draw room door close glide room few minute return trunk like distressed put sorrowful face like cheer draw room bell ring few minute tap school room door young lady want draw room seem talk mamma enter stop introduce few kind word face smile smile pleasing voice low sweet feel like address return hear return school room tired journey feel inclined walk join garden moment exclaim enter school room like answer like much repeat like like inquire like nose like nose pinch nose droop moment hopeless case attempt vindication nose disappointed expectation regard prove principled amiable accomplish woman gentle steadiness fit task undertake trouble become fond anxious give satisfaction difficult task strong prejudice combat struggle careless inattentive habit obstinate determination overcome goodness fit start steady improvement arrival seem throw fancy like seem wish act opinion form patience wonderful indifferent observer fancy favourite speak more other convers interesting subject try draw feeling sentiment give much trouble insensible time acknowledge kind person nose driop removal place follow morning grant holiday young person room house visit admire time settle convenient arrangement several pet assistance cousin hang cage parrot small bird conservatory time bring pair turtle dove gift teach young parrot speak intend turtle dove interesting age begin independent coo other melodious manner parrot give proof fine ability bird house furnish conservatory delight more part flower fragrant bright beautiful bird happy sing branch more walk bird flower feel sad wish ungratified long give papa account arrangement search find read library answer tap door usual kind voice love book throw seat low stool knee keep face pour history enter arrangement attention satisfaction heart desire continue great age want talk responsibility responsibility love fine word pick word nice word papa understand responsibility new home hear other day keep father house many responsibility regulate house attend way comfort school attend poor person visit large parish find large parish mean understand rest school visit poor person
