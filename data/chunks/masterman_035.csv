"As Ready had predicted, the weather set in fine after the violent storm of which we have made mention.  For a fortnight, with little intermission, it continued fine, and during that time, Ready, Mr Seagrave, and William worked from daylight till dusk at the storehouse, which they were so anxious to complete, and were so tired when their work was over, that even William did not ask Ready to go on with his history.  At last the storehouse was complete, thatched and wattled in on three sides, leaving one open for ventilation; the lower part, which had been arranged for the folding of the stock at night and during the rainy season, was also wattled in with cocoa-nut boughs on three sides, and made a very comfortable retreat for the animals.  The winding path to the storehouse was also cut through the cocoa-nut grove, but the stumps were not removed, as they could not spare the time.  All the stores that they had brought round were put into the storehouse, and they were now ready to take up some other job.  It was, however, agreed that, on the day after the building was finished, they should all have a day's holiday, which they certainly did require.  William caught some fish, a turtle was speared and wheeled up to the house; and they not only had a holiday, but a feast.  Mr Seagrave and William had been walking on the beach with Mrs Seagrave and the children, while Ready was assisting Juno in cutting up the turtle; they had shown Mrs Seagrave the storehouse, and the goats with the four kids had been led there, as there was no longer any occasion for them to remain in the house.  The weather was beautiful, and they agreed to go and examine the garden.  They found that the seeds had not yet commenced sprouting, notwithstanding the heavy rains. ""I should have thought that so much rain would have made them come up,"" said Mrs Seagrave. ""No, my dear,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""they require more of the sun than they will have till the rainy season is nearly over; a few days like this, and they will soon be above-ground."" ""Let us sit down on this knoll, it is quite dry,"" said Mrs Seagrave. ""I little thought,"" continued she, ""that I could have been so happy in a desert island.  I thought I should feel the loss of books very severely, but I really do not think that I could have found time to read."" ""Employment is a source of happiness, especially when you are usefully employed.  An industrious person is always a happy person, provided he is not obliged to work too hard; and even where you have cause for unhappiness, nothing makes you forget it so soon as occupation."" ""But, mamma, we shall not always have so much to do as we have now,"" said William. ""Of course not,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""and then we shall find our books a great source of enjoyment.  I am anxious to go to the other side of the island, and see what have been spared to us, and whether they have been much damaged; but that cannot be until after the rains are over, and we can use the boat again. ""Look at this minute insect which is crawling on my finger,"" said Mr Seagrave, turning to William: ""what a number of legs it has!"" ""Yes, I have seen something like it in old books.  How fast it runs with its little legs; thinner than hairs--how wonderful!"" ""Yes, William,"" replied Mr Seagrave, ""we have only to examine into any portion, however small, of creation, and we are immediately filled with wonder.  There is nothing which points out to us the immensity and the omniscience of the Almighty more than the careful provision which has been made by Him for the smallest and most insignificant of created beings.  This little animal is perhaps one of many millions, who have their term of existence, and their enjoyment, as well as we have.  What is it?--an insect of the minutest kind, a nothing in creation; yet has the same care been bestowed upon its formation: these little legs, hardly visible, have their muscles and their sinews; and every other portion of its body is as complete, as fearfully and wonderfully fashioned, as our own.  Such is his will; and what insects we ought to feel ourselves, when compared to the God of power and of love!"" ""Let me also point out to you, William,"" continued Mr Seagrave, ""the infinity of his creative power, displayed in endless variety.  Amongst the millions of men that have been born, and died, if ever yet were there seen two faces or two bodies exactly alike; nay, if you could examine the leaves upon the trees, although there may be millions upon millions in a forest, you could not discover two leaves of precisely the same form and make."" ""I have often tried in vain,"" replied William; ""yet some animals are so much alike, that I cannot perceive any difference between them--sheep, for instance."" ""Very true; you cannot tell the difference, because you have not examined them; but a shepherd, if he has seven hundred sheep under his care, will know every one of them from the others; which proves that there must be a great difference between them, although not perceptible to the casual observer; and the same, no doubt, is the case with all other classes of animals."" ""Yes, William,"" observed Ready; ""I have often wondered over the things that I have seen, and I have even in my ignorance felt what your papa has now told you; and it has brought into my mind the words of Job: `When I consider, I am afraid of him.'"" ""Papa,"" said William, after a pause in the conversation, ""you have referred to the variety--the wonderful variety--shown in the works of the Deity.  Tell me some other prominent feature in creation."" ""One of the most remarkable, William, is order."" ""Point out to me, papa, where and in what that quality is most observable."" ""Everywhere and in everything, my dear boy; whether we cast our eyes up to the heavens above us, or penetrate into the bowels of the earth, the principle of order is everywhere--everything is governed by fixed laws, which cannot be disobeyed: we have order in the seasons, in the tides, in the movement of the heavenly bodies, in the instinct of animals, in the duration of life assigned to each; from the elephant who lives more than a century, to the ephemeral fly, whose whole existence is limited to an hour. ""Inanimate nature is subject to the same unvarying laws.  Metals, and rocks, and earths, and all the mineral kingdom follow one law in their crystallisation, never varying from the form assigned to them; each atom depositing itself in the allotted place, until that form is complete: we have order in production, order in decay; but all is simple to him by whom the planets were thrown out into space, and were commanded to roll in their eternal orbits."" ""Yes; the stars in the heavens are beautiful,"" said William, ""but they are not placed there in order."" ""The fixed stars do not appear to us to be in order--that is, they do not stud the heavens at equal distances from each other as we view them; but you must recollect that they are at very different distances from this earth, spreading over all infinity of space; and we have reason to suppose that this our earth is but a mere unit in the multitude of created worlds, only one single portion of an infinite whole.  As the stars now appear to us, they are useful to the mariner, enabling him to cross the trackless seas; and to the astronomer, who calculates the times and seasons.""
