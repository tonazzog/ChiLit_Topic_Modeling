"When they all rose up the next morning, the clouds had cleared off, and the sun was shining bright.  Ready and Juno were the first out of the house--Ready with the telescope under his arm, which he always took with him when he went his rounds, as he termed it, in the morning. ""Well, Juno,"" said Ready, ""this is a fine morning after the rain."" ""Yes, Massa Ready, very fine morning; but how I get fire light, and make kittle boil for breakfast, I really don't know--stick and cocoa-nut trash all so wet."" ""Before I went to bed last night, Juno, I covered up the embers with ashes, put some stones over them, and then some cocoa-nut branches, so I think you will find some fire there yet.  I was going my morning's round, but I will stay a little and help you."" ""Tank you, Massa Ready; plenty rain fell last night."" ""Yes, not a little, Juno; you must not expect to find the water at the well very clear this morning; indeed, I doubt if you will see the well at all.  Here's some stuff which is not very wet."" ""I got plenty of fire, too,"" replied Juno, who had removed the branches and stones, and was now on her knees blowing up the embers. ""You'll do very well now, Juno,"" said Ready; ""besides, William will be out directly--so I'll leave you."" Ready whistled to the dogs, who came bounding out, and then set off on his round of inspection.  He first directed his steps to the well in the ravine; but, instead of the gushing spring and the limpid clear water, with which the cask sunk for a well had been filled, there was now a muddy torrent, rushing down the ravine, and the well was covered with it, and not to be distinguished. ""I thought as much,"" said Ready, musing over the impetuous stream; ""well, better too much water than too little.""  Ready waded through, as he wished to examine the turtle-pond, which was on the other side of the stream.  Finding all right, he again crossed the water, where it was now spread wide over the sandy beach, until he came to the other point where he had moored his boat, both by the head and stern, with a rope, and a heavy stone made fast to it, as an anchor. From this point, as usual, he surveyed the horizon with his telescope; not that he thought that there was a chance of a vessel arriving among these islands; but, still, as it was possible, he took the trouble; but never except when he went out in the morning alone, as he was aware that the very circumstance of his so doing would make Mr Seagrave melancholy and unsettled.  As usual, he dropped the telescope on his arm, after his survey, saying to himself, ""Little use doing that."" The gale having blown offshore, the boat had dragged her moorings, and was so far out that Ready could not get at her. ""Here's a puzzle,"" said the old man; ""how foolish of me not to have made a line fast to the shore!  I'll not trust myself to John Shark by swimming to the boat."" ""Let me see.""  Ready took the halyards and sheets belonging to the boat's sails, which he had left on the beach, and bent one on to the other until he had sufficient length of rope.  He then made a piece of wood, about two feet long, fast by the middle to the end of the rope, and, after one or two attempts, contrived to throw it into the boat. The piece of wood caught under one of the thwarts, and this enabled him to draw the boat to the shore. Having baled out the water which had fallen into her during the storm, he then landed again and examined the garden. ""Now to find the sheep and goats,"" said Ready, ""and then my morning's walk is over.  Now, Romulus, now, Remus, boys, find them out,"" continued he; and the dogs, who appeared to know what he was in search of, went away in pursuit, and soon found the sheep and two of the goats, but the third goat was not with them. ""Why, where can Black Nanny be?"" muttered Ready, stopping a little while; at last he heard a bleat, in a small copse of brushwood, to which he directed his steps, followed by the dogs.  ""I thought as much,"" said he, as he perceived Nanny lying down in the copse with two new-born kids at her side.  ""Come, my little fellows, we must find some shelter for you,"" said he, taking one up under each arm.  ""Come, Nanny."" Ready walked back to the house, and brought in the kids, followed by Nanny.  He found Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the children all dressed. Caroline and Tommy gave a scream of delight when they saw the little kids, and even little Albert clapped his hands.  As soon as Ready put them down on the ground, Tommy and Caroline had each their arms round one. ""I've brought an addition to our family, Mrs Seagrave,"" said Ready: ""we must allow them to remain in the house until I can knock up a little shelter for them.  This is only a beginning; I expect we shall soon have more."" As soon as the children could be persuaded to part with the kids, Nanny was tied up in a corner, and was very content with fondling and nursing her progeny.  Juno and William brought in the breakfast, and as soon as it was over, Mr Seagrave said, ""Now, Ready, I think we must hold a council, and make arrangements as to our allotted duties and employments during the rainy season.  We have a great deal to do, and must not be idle."" ""Yes, sir, we have a great deal to do, and, to get through our work, we must have order and method in our doings.  I've lived long enough to know how much can be done by regularity and discipline.  Why, sir, there is more work got out of men in a well-conducted man-of-war than there can in the merchant service in double the time.  And why so?  Because everything is in its place, and there is a place for everything."" ""I agree with you,"" said Mrs Seagrave; ""method is everything.  While one careless little girl is looking for her thimble, another will have finished her work."" ""I assure you I never should have known what can be done by order and arrangement, if I had not been pressed on board of a man-of-war.  I found that everything was done in silence.  Every man was to his post; everyone had a rope to haul upon, or a rope to let go; the boatswain piped, and in a few seconds every sail was set or taken in as was required.  It seemed to me at first like magic.  And you observe, Mr Seagrave, that when there is order and discipline, every man becomes of individual importance.  If I learnt nothing else on board of a man-of-war, I learnt to make the most of time, and the most of the strength which you could command."" ""You are very right, Ready; you must teach us to do the same,"" replied Mr Seagrave. ""We have so much to do, that I hardly know where to begin; yet, sir, we must work at present how we can, and when we can, until we have got things into a little better order.  We have done well up to the present."" ""What do you think we ought to do first?"" ""Well, sir, our first job will be to haul up the boat and secure her from harm; we will half-dock her in the sand, and cover her over, for I do not think it will be safe to go in her now to the other side of the island, where the sea will always be rough.""
