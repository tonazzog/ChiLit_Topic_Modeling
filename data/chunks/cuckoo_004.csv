"CHAPTER IV. THE COUNTRY OF THE NODDING MANDARINS.      ""We're all nodding, nid-nid-nodding.""  _How_ she managed it she never knew; but, somehow or other, it _was_ managed. She seemed to slide up the chain just as easily as in a general way she would have slidden down, only without any disagreeable anticipation of a bump at the end of the journey. And when she got to the top how wonderfully different it looked from anything she could have expected! The doors stood open, and Griselda found them quite big enough, or herself quite small enough--which it was she couldn't tell, and as it was all a matter of fancy she decided not to trouble to inquire--to pass through quite comfortably. And inside there was the most charming little snuggery imaginable. It was something like a saloon railway carriage--it seemed to be all lined and carpeted and everything, with rich mossy red velvet; there was a little round table in the middle and two arm-chairs, on one of which sat the cuckoo--""quite like other people,"" thought Griselda to herself--while the other, as he pointed out to Griselda by a little nod, was evidently intended for her. ""Thank you,"" said she, sitting down on the chair as she spoke. ""Are you comfortable?"" inquired the cuckoo. ""Quite,"" replied Griselda, looking about her with great satisfaction. ""Are all cuckoo clocks like this when you get up inside them?"" she inquired. ""I can't think how there's room for this dear little place between the clock and the wall. Is it a hole cut out of the wall on purpose, cuckoo?"" ""Hush!"" said the cuckoo, ""we've got other things to talk about. First, shall I lend you one of my mantles? You may feel cold."" ""I don't just now,"" replied Griselda; ""but perhaps I _might_."" She looked at her little bare feet as she spoke, and wondered why _they_ weren't cold, for it was very chilblainy weather. The cuckoo stood up, and with one of his claws reached from a corner where it was hanging a cloak which Griselda had not before noticed. For it was hanging wrong side out, and the lining was red velvet, very like what the sides of the little room were covered with, so it was no wonder she had not noticed it. Had it been hanging the _right_ side out she must have done so; this side was so very wonderful! It was all feathers--feathers of every shade and colour, but beautifully worked in, somehow, so as to lie quite smoothly and evenly, one colour melting away into another like those in a prism, so that you could hardly tell where one began and another ended. ""What a _lovely_ cloak!"" said Griselda, wrapping it round her and feeling even more comfortable than before, as she watched the rays of the little lamp in the roof--I think I was forgetting to tell you that the cuckoo's boudoir was lighted by a dear little lamp set into the red velvet roof like a pearl in a ring--playing softly on the brilliant colours of the feather mantle. ""It's better than lovely,"" said the cuckoo, ""as you shall see. Now, Griselda,"" he continued, in the tone of one coming to business--""now, Griselda, let us talk."" ""We have been talking,"" said Griselda, ""ever so long. I am very comfortable. When you say 'let us talk' like that, it makes me forget all I wanted to say. Just let me sit still and say whatever comes into my head."" ""That won't do,"" said the cuckoo; ""we must have a plan of action."" ""A what?"" said Griselda. ""You see you _have_ a great deal to learn,"" said the cuckoo triumphantly. ""You don't understand what I say."" ""But I didn't come up here to learn,"" said Griselda; ""I can do that down there;"" and she nodded her head in the direction of the ante-room table. ""I want to play."" ""Just so,"" said the cuckoo; ""that's what I want to talk about. What do you call 'play'--blindman's-buff and that sort of thing?"" ""No,"" said Griselda, considering. ""I'm getting rather too big for that kind of play. Besides, cuckoo, you and I alone couldn't have much fun at blindman's-buff; there'd be only me to catch you or you to catch me."" ""Oh, we could easily get more,"" said the cuckoo. ""The mandarins would be pleased to join."" ""The mandarins!"" repeated Griselda. ""Why, cuckoo, they're not alive! How could they play?"" The cuckoo looked at her gravely for a minute, then shook his head. ""You have a _great_ deal to learn,"" he said solemnly. ""Don't you know that _everything's_ alive?"" ""No,"" said Griselda, ""I don't; and I don't know what you mean, and I don't think I want to know what you mean. I want to talk about playing."" ""Well,"" said the cuckoo, ""talk."" ""What I call playing,"" pursued Griselda, ""is--I have thought about it now, you see--is being amused. If you will amuse me, cuckoo, I will count that you are playing with me."" ""How shall I amuse you?"" inquired he. ""Oh, that's for you to find out!"" exclaimed Griselda. ""You might tell me fairy stories, you know: if you're a fairy you should know lots; or--oh yes, of course that would be far nicer--if you are a fairy you might take me with you to fairyland."" Again the cuckoo shook his head. ""That,"" said he, ""I cannot do."" ""Why not?"" said Griselda. ""Lots of children have been there."" ""I doubt it,"" said the cuckoo. ""_Some_ may have been, but not lots. And some may have thought they had been there who hadn't really been there at all. And as to those who have been there, you may be sure of one thing--they were not _taken_, they found their own way. No one ever was _taken_ to fairyland--to the real fairyland. They may have been taken to the neighbouring countries, but not to fairyland itself."" ""And how is one ever to find one's own way there?"" asked Griselda. ""That I cannot tell you either,"" replied the cuckoo. ""There are many roads there; you may find yours some day. And if ever you do find it, be sure you keep what you see of it well swept and clean, and then you may see further after a while. Ah, yes, there are many roads and many doors into fairyland!"" ""Doors!"" cried Griselda. ""Are there any doors into fairyland in this house?"" ""Several,"" said the cuckoo; ""but don't waste your time looking for them at present. It would be no use."" ""Then how will you amuse me?"" inquired Griselda, in a rather disappointed tone. ""Don't you care to go anywhere except to fairyland?"" said the cuckoo. ""Oh yes, there are lots of places I wouldn't mind seeing. Not geography sort of places--it would be just like lessons to go to India and Africa and all those places--but _queer_ places, like the mines where the goblins make diamonds and precious stones, and the caves down under the sea where the mermaids live. And--oh, I've just thought--now I'm so nice and little, I _would_ like to go all over the mandarins' palace in the great saloon."" ""That can be easily managed,"" said the cuckoo; ""but--excuse me for an instant,"" he exclaimed suddenly. He gave a spring forward and disappeared. Then Griselda heard his voice outside the doors, ""Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo."" It was three o'clock. The doors opened again to let him through, and he re-settled himself on his chair. ""As I was saying,"" he went on, ""nothing could be easier. But that palace, as you call it, has an entrance on the other side, as well as the one you know."" ""Another door, do you mean?"" said Griselda. ""How funny! Does it go through the wall? And where does it lead to?"" ""It leads,"" replied the cuckoo, ""it leads to the country of the Nodding Mandarins."" ""_What_ fun!"" exclaimed Griselda, clapping her hands. ""Cuckoo, do let us go there. How can we get down? You can fly, but must I slide down the chain again?"" ""Oh dear, no,"" said the cuckoo, ""by no means. You have only to stretch out your feather mantle, flap it as if it was wings--so""--he flapped his own wings encouragingly--""wish, and there you'll be."" ""Where?"" said Griselda bewilderedly. ""Wherever you wish to be, of course,"" said the cuckoo. ""Are you ready? Here goes."" ""Wait--wait a moment,"" cried Griselda. ""Where am I to wish to be?""

"""Bless the child!"" exclaimed the cuckoo. ""Where _do_ you wish to be? You said you wanted to visit the country of the Nodding Mandarins."" ""Yes; but am I to wish first to be in the palace in the great saloon?"" ""Certainly,"" replied the cuckoo. ""That is the entrance to Mandarin Land, and you said you would like to see through it. So--you're surely ready now?"" ""A thought has just struck me,"" said Griselda. ""How will you know what o'clock it is, so as to come back in time to tell the next hour? My aunts will get into such a fright if you go wrong again! Are you sure we shall have time to go to the mandarins' country to-night?"" ""Time!"" repeated the cuckoo; ""what is time? Ah, Griselda, you have a _very_ great deal to learn! What do you mean by time?"" ""I don't know,"" replied Griselda, feeling rather snubbed. ""Being slow or quick--I suppose that's what I mean."" ""And what is slow, and what is quick?"" said the cuckoo. ""_All_ a matter of fancy! If everything that's been done since the world was made till now, was done over again in five minutes, you'd never know the difference."" [MANDARINS NODDING.] ""Oh, cuckoo, I wish you wouldn't!"" cried poor Griselda; ""you're worse than sums, you do so puzzle me. It's like what you said about nothing being big or little, only it's worse. Where would all the days and hours be if there was nothing but minutes? Oh, cuckoo, you said you'd amuse me, and you do nothing but puzzle me."" ""It was your own fault. You wouldn't get ready,"" said the cuckoo. ""_Now_, here goes! Flap and wish."" Griselda flapped and wished. She felt a sort of rustle in the air, that was all--then she found herself standing with the cuckoo in front of the Chinese cabinet, the door of which stood open, while the mandarins on each side, nodding politely, seemed to invite them to enter. Griselda hesitated. ""Go on,"" said the cuckoo, patronizingly; ""ladies first."" Griselda went on. To her surprise, inside the cabinet it was quite light, though where the light came from that illuminated all the queer corners and recesses and streamed out to the front, where stood the mandarins, she could not discover. The ""palace"" was not quite as interesting as she had expected. There were lots of little rooms in it opening on to balconies commanding, no doubt, a splendid view of the great saloon; there were ever so many little staircases leading to more little rooms and balconies; but it all seemed empty and deserted. ""I don't care for it,"" said Griselda, stopping short at last; ""it's all the same, and there's nothing to see. I thought my aunts kept ever so many beautiful things in here, and there's nothing."" ""Come along, then,"" said the cuckoo. ""I didn't expect you'd care for the palace, as you called it, much. Let us go out the other way."" He hopped down a sort of little staircase near which they were standing, and Griselda followed him willingly enough. At the foot they found themselves in a vestibule, much handsomer than the entrance at the other side, and the cuckoo, crossing it, lifted one of his claws and touched a spring in the wall. Instantly a pair of large doors flew open in the middle, revealing to Griselda the prettiest and most curious sight she had ever seen. A flight of wide shallow steps led down from this doorway into a long, long avenue bordered by stiffly growing trees, from the branches of which hung innumerable lamps of every colour, making a perfect network of brilliance as far as the eye could reach. ""Oh, how lovely!"" cried Griselda, clapping her hands. ""It'll be like walking along a rainbow. Cuckoo, come quick."" ""Stop,"" said the cuckoo; ""we've a good way to go. There's no need to walk. Palanquin!"" He flapped his wings, and instantly a palanquin appeared at the foot of the steps. It was made of carved ivory, and borne by four Chinese-looking figures with pigtails and bright-coloured jackets. A feeling came over Griselda that she was dreaming, or else that she had seen this palanquin before. She hesitated. Suddenly she gave a little jump of satisfaction. ""I know,"" she exclaimed. ""It's exactly like the one that stands under a glass shade on Lady Lavander's drawing-room mantelpiece. I wonder if it is the very one? Fancy me being able to get _into_ it!"" She looked at the four bearers. Instantly they all nodded. ""What do they mean?"" asked Griselda, turning to the cuckoo. ""Get in,"" he replied. ""Yes, I'm just going to get in,"" she said; ""but what do _they_ mean when they nod at me like that?"" ""They mean, of course, what I tell you--'Get in,'"" said the cuckoo. ""Why don't they say so, then?"" persisted Griselda, getting in, however, as she spoke. ""Griselda, you have a _very_ great----"" began the cuckoo, but Griselda interrupted him. ""Cuckoo,"" she exclaimed, ""if you say that again, I'll jump out of the palanquin and run away home to bed. Of course I've a great deal to learn--that's why I like to ask questions about everything I see. Now, tell me where we are going."" ""In the first place,"" said the cuckoo, ""are you comfortable?"" ""Very,"" said Griselda, settling herself down among the cushions. It was a change from the cuckoo's boudoir. There were no chairs or seats, only a number of very, _very_ soft cushions covered with green silk. There were green silk curtains all round, too, which you could draw or not as you pleased, just by touching a spring. Griselda stroked the silk gently. It was not ""fruzzley"" silk, if you know what that means; it did not make you feel as if your nails wanted cutting, or as if all the rough places on your skin were being rubbed up the wrong way; its softness was like that of a rose or pansy petal. ""What nice silk!"" said Griselda. ""I'd like a dress of it. I never noticed that the palanquin was lined so nicely,"" she continued, ""for I suppose it _is_ the one from Lady Lavander's mantelpiece? There couldn't be two so exactly like each other."" The cuckoo gave a sort of whistle. ""What a goose you are, my dear!"" he exclaimed. ""Excuse me,"" he continued, seeing that Griselda looked rather offended; ""I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, but you won't let me say the other thing, you know. The palanquin from Lady Lavander's! I should think not. You might as well mistake one of those horrible paper roses that Dorcas sticks in her vases for one of your aunt's Gloires de Dijon! The palanquin from Lady Lavander's--a clumsy human imitation not worth looking at!"" ""I didn't know,"" said Griselda humbly. ""Do they make such beautiful things in Mandarin Land?"" ""Of course,"" said the cuckoo. Griselda sat silent for a minute or two, but very soon she recovered her spirits. ""Will you please tell me where we are going?"" she asked again. ""You'll see directly,"" said the cuckoo; ""not that I mind telling you. There's to be a grand reception at one of the palaces to-night. I thought you'd like to assist at it. It'll give you some idea of what a palace is like. By-the-by, can you dance?"" ""A little,"" replied Griselda. ""Ah, well, I dare say you will manage. I've ordered a court dress for you. It will be all ready when we get there."" ""Thank you,"" said Griselda. In a minute or two the palanquin stopped. The cuckoo got out, and Griselda followed him.
