"CHAPTER 6. ROGER HIS OWN MASTER. There lay Roger under the tree, thinking that there was nothing to prevent his having all his own way now, and that he was going to be very happy.  He had always thought it hard that he could not have his own way entirely, and had been unsatisfied with a much greater degree of liberty than most people wish or have. He had hitherto led a wandering life, having no home duties, no school to go to, no trade to work at,--no garden, or other pleasure, to fix him to one spot.  He had gone, with his uncle, from sporting on the moors, in one season of the year, to sporting in the marshes in another; and, wild as was this way of life, it made his will so much wilder, that he was always wishing for more liberty still.  When his aunt had desired him to watch the kettle, as it hung over the fire near the tent, or asked him to help her in shaking out their bedding, or cleaning their utensils, he had turned sulky, and wished that he lived alone, where he need not be plagued about other people's affairs.  When his uncle had ordered him to attend at a certain spot and hour, with nets or a gun, he had been wont to feel himself seized with a sudden desire to wander in an opposite direction, or to lie half asleep in the sun, too lazy to work at all.  When he had played truant, and returned late to the tent, and found nothing better left to eat than a dry crust of bread, or the cold remains of a mess of fish, he had frequently thought how pleasant it would be to have the best of everything for himself, and only his dog to eat up the rest.  So this boy had often felt and thought; and so would many think and feel, perhaps, if there were many as forlorn and friendless as he, with no one to love and be loved by.  Though he had had an uncle and aunt, he had never had a friend.  He knew that they cared about him only because he could help to keep the tent, and take the game; and, feeling this, it was irksome to him to be under their orders. The time was now come for which he had so often longed.  He was his own master completely.  There was nobody near who could order or compel him to do anything; while he, on his part, had an obedient servant in his dog.  The sky was blue and warm overhead, and the trees cast a pleasant shade.  The Red-hill was now an island, which he had all to himself; and it was richly stocked with game, for his food and sport.  Here he could have his own way, and be completely happy. Such was Roger's idea when he stole the tinder-box, and crossed to the hill; and this was what he said to himself as he cooked his meal, and when he lay down after it on the grass, with the bees humming round him, and the sound of the waters being now a pleasant ripple, instead of the rush and roar of yesterday.  He desired his dog to lie down, and not disturb him; and he took this opportunity to change the animal's name. Stephen Redfurn, taking up the quarrel of the day against the bishops, would have the dog called ""Bishop,"" and nothing else.  Roger had always wished to call him ""Spy;"" but Bishop would never answer to the name of Spy, or even seem to hear it.  Now, however, Bishop was to be Spy, as there was no one here to indulge the dog with his old name; and Spy was told so many times over, and with all the devices that could be thought of for impressing the fact on his memory. This lesson being given, Roger shut his eyes, and thought he would sleep as long as he chose; but, in the first place, he found himself too much heated for sleep.  He considered that it was no wonder, after broiling himself in making a fire to broil his hare.  He wished animals ran about ready cooked--as fruits grow on the sunny side of trees.  It was too bad to have to bustle and toil for an hour, to get ready what was eaten in ten minutes; and it just passed through his mind that, whatever Nan Redfurn might have sometimes said and done to him, she had usually saved him all trouble in cooking, and had had his meals ready for him whenever he chose to be at the tent at meal times.  He rose, and thought he could find a cooler place, further under the trees. He did so, and again lay down.  Sleep began to steal over him; and, at the same time, the thought crept into his mind that he should never more see Stephen Redfurn.  The ideas that come when one is dropping asleep are very vivid; and this one startled Roger so, that Spy found it out, and pricked up his ears, as if at some alarm.  This thought would not go away; for it so happened that the last words that Stephen and Roger had spoken together were angry ones.  Stephen had ordered Roger to carry the fry they had fished for manure to a field, where he had promised to deposit it by a certain time.  Roger had been sure that the fish would be better for lying in the sun a while longer, and refused to touch it. No matter which was right about the manure; both were wrong in being angry.  Stephen had said that Roger was a young rascal, who would never come to good; and Roger had looked impertinently in his uncle's face, while whistling to the dog to come with him, and make sport among the water-fowl.  It was that face--that countenance of his uncle's, as he had last seen it, which was before Roger's eyes now, as he lay dozing. With it came the angry tones of Stephen's voice, saying that he would never come to good.  Mixed and confused with this was the roar of a coming flood, and a question (how and whence spoken he knew not) whether his uncle might not possibly have been saved, if he had not, against orders, carried away Bishop--for the dog was still Bishop in his master's dreams. Roger started bolt upright, and looked about him.  He felt very tired; but he thought he would not lie down again just yet.  It was odd that he could not get sound asleep, so tired as he was.  If he should not sleep better than this at night, what should he do?  He wished he had some more of that woman's cherry-brandy.  He had slept sound enough after drinking that.  It was well for Roger that he was not now within reach of intoxicating liquors--the state of his mind would probably have made a drunkard of him. His mind ran strangely on his uncle, and his uncle's last looks and words, even as he stood wide awake, and staring at the bee-hives.  A rustle in the briars behind him made him jump as if he had been shot. It was only a partridge taking wing. ""Whirr away!"" said Roger to her.  ""You can't go far.  You will have to light again upon my island.  You all belong to me--you swarming creatures!  You may run about awhile, and flutter away a bit; but you will all belong to me at last, with Spy to help me.  I'll have some sport, now.  Here, Spy!  Spy!"" Spy had disappeared, and did not come when called.  A whistle brought him, however, at last.  He came out of the thicket, licking his chops. Being commanded to bring his game, he soon produced two rabbits.  It was easy work for the dog to catch them; for the poor creatures had no holes here.  They had come to this raised ground from a warren some way off, where they had been soaked out of their holes.

"Spy was praised for everything but not answering to his name.  For that he was lectured, and then sent off again, to try what he could find.  He brought in prey of various kinds; for he could not stir among the trees without starting some.  During the fun, as Roger thought it, while the terrified birds were fluttering among the branches of the trees, and the scared animals bursting through the thicket, Roger resolved that he would not plague himself with any more thoughts of Stephen and Nan.  If they were drowned, it was none of his doing; and, as for Stephen's anger yesterday, there was nothing new in that; Stephen was angry every day of his life.  He would not be scared out of his sleep any more by nonsense. He would not give up having his own way to see Stephen and Nan under these very trees; and, as he had got his own way at last, he would enjoy it. This mood went on till there was such a heap of dead animals, that Roger began to think whether he could skin them all, and clean their skins, in such hot weather as this, before they were unfit for any use.  As for eating them, here was twenty times as much food as could be eaten while it was good.  He did just remember the children and Ailwin, and how much they probably wanted food; but he settled that it was no business of his; and he was not going to trouble himself to leave his island for anybody.  He would call in Spy, and tie him up; for there must be no more game killed to-day. Spy did not come for any calling,--for anything short of the well-known whistle, as Roger would not utter the name of Bishop.  Roger grew very angry at being obeyed no better than this; and his last whistle was so shrill that the dog seemed to know what it threatened, refused to answer it as long as he dared, and then came unwillingly, with fear in every attitude.  He gave a low whine when he saw his master; as he had good reason to do.  Roger tied him to a tree, and then gave loose to his passion.  He thrashed the dog with a switch till the poor creature's whine was heard and pitied by the children and Ailwin on their house-top; and there is no knowing how long the whipping might not have gone on, if the animal had not at last turned furious, and snapped at Roger in a way which made him think of giving over, and finding something else to do with his sovereignty. He found it was rather dull work, so far, having all his own way, in an island of his own.  At last, he bethought himself of an amusement he had been fond of before he lived so much in the moors and the carrs.  He bethought himself of bird's-nesting.  It was too late for eggs; but he thought the bird-families might not have all dispersed.  Here were plenty of trees, and they must be full of birds; for, though they were silent to-day (he did wish the place was not quite so silent!) they sometimes sent their warblings so far over the carr, that Nan Redfurn would mention them in the tent.  He would see what ailed them, that they would not give him any music to-day.  By incessant cooing, he obtained an answer from one solitary pigeon; which he took advantage of to climb the tree, and look for the nest.  He found a nest; but there was nothing in it.  He climbed several trees, and found abundance of nests; but all deserted.  Except his solitary pigeon (which presently vanished), there appeared to be not a winged creature in all those trees.  The birds had been frightened away by the roar of the flood of yesterday; and, perhaps, by seeing the fields, to which they had been wont to resort for their food, all turned into a waste of muddy waters. Roger threw to the ground every empty nest he found, from the common inability of a boy to keep his hands off a bird's-nest.  When he was tired of climbing trees, he picked up all the scattered nests, and laid them in a long row on the grass.  They looked dismal enough.  It is disagreeable to see a range of houses left half-built (such as may be seen in the neighbourhood of large towns), with the doorways gaping, and the window-spaces empty, and roofs hardly covering in the dark inside; but such a row of houses is less dismal than Roger's array of birds'-nests.  There is something in the very make of a bird's-nest which rouses thoughts of blue or red-spotted eggs, of callow young birds, with their large hungry eyes and beaks, or of twittering fledglings, training for a summer life of pleasure.  To see, instead of these, their silent empty habitations, extended in a long row, would be enough to make any one dull and sad.  So Roger found.  He kicked them into a heap under a tree, and thought that they would make a fine crackling fire.  He would burn them, every one. While he was wondering whether any birds would come back to miss their nests, it struck him that he had not thought how he was to pass the night.  It was nothing new to him to sleep in the open air.  He liked it best at this season.  But he had usually had a rug to lie upon, with the tent over him; or a blanket; or, at worst, he had a sack to creep into. The clothes he had on were old and thin; and as he looked at them, it made him angry to think that he was not to have everything as he liked it, after all.  Here he should have to pass a cold night, and with nothing between him and the hard ground.  He thought of gathering leaves, moss, and high grass, to roll himself up in, like a squirrel in its hole; but the trouble was what he did not like.  He stood listlessly thinking how much trouble it would cost to collect moss and leaves for the purpose; and, while he was so thinking, he went on pelting his dog with birds'-nests, and seeing how the angry dog, unable to get loose, snapped up and shook to pieces the nests which fell within his reach. Roger knew that he ought to be skinning some of the dead animals, if he really meant to secure all their skins, before it was too late; but this also was troublesome.  Instead of doing this, he went round the hill, to see what the Linacres were about, resolving by no means to appear to see them, if they should be making signs from the window to have the things back again that he had carried away.  On coming out of the shade on that side of the hill, he was surprised to see smoke still going up from his fire, considering that the fire was nearly out when he had left it. Something more strange met his eye as he ran forward.  There was the nice clean blanket spread out on the ground, with the tinder-box in the middle. ""Somebody has been here!"" cried Roger, much offended.  ""What business has anybody in my island?  Coming when my back is turned!  If I had only heard them coming to meddle--!""
