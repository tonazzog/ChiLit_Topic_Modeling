"CHAPTER 7. THE BURGLARS It was much too fine a night to think of going to bed at once, and so, although the witching hour of nine P.M. had struck, Edward and I were still leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts, watching the play of the cedar-branch shadows on the moonlit lawn, and planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow. From below, strains of the jocund piano declared that the Olympians were enjoying themselves in their listless, impotent way; for the new curate had been bidden to dinner that night, and was at the moment unclerically proclaiming to all the world that he feared no foe. His discordant vociferations doubtless started a train of thought in Edward’s mind, for the youth presently remarked, a propos of nothing that had been said before, “I believe the new curate’s rather gone on Aunt Maria.” I scouted the notion. “Why, she’s quite old,” I said. (She must have seen some five-and-twenty summers.) “Of course she is,” replied Edward, scornfully. “It’s not her, it’s her money he’s after, you bet!” “Didn’t know she had any money,” I observed timidly. “Sure to have,” said my brother, with confidence. “Heaps and heaps.” Silence ensued, both our minds being busy with the new situation thus presented,--mine, in wonderment at this flaw that so often declared itself in enviable natures of fullest endowment,--in a grown-up man and a good cricketer, for instance, even as this curate; Edward’s (apparently), in the consideration of how such a state of things, supposing it existed, could be best turned to his own advantage. “Bobby Ferris told me,” began Edward in due course, “that there was a fellow spooning his sister once--” “What’s spooning?” I asked meekly. “Oh, _I_ dunno,” said Edward, indifferently. “It’s--it’s--it’s just a thing they do, you know. And he used to carry notes and messages and things between ‘em, and he got a shilling almost every time.” “What, from each of ‘em?” I innocently inquired. Edward looked at me with scornful pity. “Girls never have any money,” he briefly explained. “But she did his exercises and got him out of rows, and told stories for him when he needed it--and much better ones than he could have made up for himself. Girls are useful in some ways. So he was living in clover, when unfortunately they went and quarrelled about something.” “Don’t see what that’s got to do with it,” I said. “Nor don’t I,” rejoined Edward. “But anyhow the notes and things stopped, and so did the shillings. Bobby was fairly cornered, for he had bought two ferrets on tick, and promised to pay a shilling a week, thinking the shillings were going on for ever, the silly young ass. So when the week was up, and he was being dunned for the shilling, he went off to the fellow and said, ‘Your broken-hearted Bella implores you to meet her at sundown,--by the hollow oak, as of old, be it only for a moment. Do not fail!’ He got all that out of some rotten book, of course. The fellow looked puzzled and said,-- “‘What hollow oak? I don’t know any hollow oak.’ “‘Perhaps it was the Royal Oak?’ said Bobby promptly, ‘cos he saw he had made a slip, through trusting too much to the rotten book; but this didn’t seem to make the fellow any happier.” “Should think not,” I said, “the Royal Oak’s an awful low sort of pub.” “I know,” said Edward. “Well, at last the fellow said, ‘I think I know what she means: the hollow tree in your father’s paddock. It happens to be an elm, but she wouldn’t know the difference. All right: say I’ll be there.’ Bobby hung about a bit, for he hadn’t got his money. ‘She was crying awfully,’ he said. Then he got his shilling.” “And wasn’t the fellow riled,” I inquired, “when he got to the place and found nothing?” “He found Bobby,” said Edward, indignantly. “Young Ferris was a gentleman, every inch of him. He brought the fellow another message from Bella: ‘I dare not leave the house. My cruel parents immure me closely If you only knew what I suffer. Your broken-hearted Bella.’ Out of the same rotten book. This made the fellow a little suspicious, ‘cos it was the old Ferrises who had been keen about the thing all through: the fellow, you see, had tin.” “But what’s that got to--” I began again. “Oh, _I_ dunno,” said Edward, impatiently. “I’m telling you just what Bobby told me. He got suspicious, anyhow, but he couldn’t exactly call Bella’s brother a liar, so Bobby escaped for the time. But when he was in a hole next week, over a stiff French exercise, and tried the same sort of game on his sister, she was too sharp for him, and he got caught out. Somehow women seem more mistrustful than men. They’re so beastly suspicious by nature, you know.” “_I_ know,” said I. “But did the two--the fellow and the sister--make it up afterwards?” “I don’t remember about that,” replied Edward, indifferently; “but Bobby got packed off to school a whole year earlier than his people meant to send him,--which was just what he wanted. So you see it all came right in the end!” I was trying to puzzle out the moral of this story--it was evidently meant to contain one somewhere--when a flood of golden lamplight mingled with the moon rays on the lawn, and Aunt Maria and the new curate strolled out on the grass below us, and took the direction of a garden seat that was backed by a dense laurel shrubbery reaching round in a half-circle to the house. Edward mediated moodily. “If we only knew what they were talking about,” said he, “you’d soon see whether I was right or not. Look here! Let’s send the kid down by the porch to reconnoitre!” “Harold’s asleep,” I said; “it seems rather a shame--” “Oh, rot!” said my brother; “he’s the youngest, and he’s got to do as he’s told!” So the luckless Harold was hauled out of bed and given his sailing-orders. He was naturally rather vexed at being stood up suddenly on the cold floor, and the job had no particular interest for him; but he was both staunch and well disciplined. The means of exit were simple enough. A porch of iron trellis came up to within easy reach of the window, and was habitually used by all three of us, when modestly anxious to avoid public notice. Harold climbed deftly down the porch like a white rat, and his night gown glimmered a moment on the gravel walk ere he was lost to sight in the darkness of the shrubbery. A brief interval of silence ensued, broken suddenly by a sound of scuffle, and then a shrill, long-drawn squeal, as of metallic surfaces in friction. Our scout had fallen into the hands of the enemy! Indolence alone had made us devolve the task of investigation on our younger brother. Now that danger had declared itself, there was no hesitation. In a second we were down the side of the porch, and crawling Cherokee-wise through the laurels to the back of the garden-seat. Piteous was the sight that greeted us. Aunt Maria was on the seat, in a white evening frock, looking--for an aunt--really quite nice. On the lawn stood an incensed curate, grasping our small brother by a large ear, which--judging from the row he was making--seemed on the point of parting company with the head it adorned. The gruesome noise he was emitting did not really affect us otherwise than aesthetically. To one who has tried both, the wail of genuine physical anguish is easy distinguishable from the pumped-up ad misericordiam blubber. Harold’s could clearly be recognised as belonging to the latter class. “Now, you young--” (whelp, _I_ think it was, but Edward stoutly maintains it was devil), said the curate, sternly; “tell us what you mean by it!” ",chapter fine night bed witching hour strike lean open window nightshirt watch play cedar branch shadow moonlit lawn plan scheme fresh devilry sunshiny morrow strain jocund piano declare enjoy listless impotent way new curate bidd dinner night moment proclaim world fear foe discordant vociferation start train thought mind youth remark propos believe new curate gone scout notion old summer course reply money bet money observe sure brother confidence heap heap silence ensue mind busy new situation present wonderment flaw declare enviable nature full endowment grow man cricketer instance curate consideration state thing suppose exist turn own advantage begin due course fellow spoon sister spoon ask thing use carry note message thing shilling time inquire scornful pity girl money explain exercise row story need one girl useful way live clover quarrell  rejoin note thing stop shilling corner buy ferret tick promise pay shilling week shilling silly young ass week dunn shilling fellow broken hearted implore meet sundown hollow oak old moment fail rotten book course fellow puzzle hollow oak hollow oak royal slip trust much rotten book seem fellow happy royal awful low sort pub last fellow mean hollow tree father paddock happen elm difference right hang bit money cry shilling fellow rile inquire place find find young gentleman inch bring fellow message leave house cruel parent immure suffer break hearted same rotten book fellow suspicious old keen thing fellow tin begin suspicious call brother liar escape time hole next week stiff french exercise try same sort game sister sharp catch woman seem mistrustful man suspicious nature fellow sister remember reply pack school whole year person mean send want end try puzzle moral story mean contain flood golden lamplight mingle moon ray lawn new curate stroll grass direction garden seat back dense laurel shrubbery reach half circle house mediate talk right let send kid porch reconnoitre asleep seem shame brother young luckless haul bed give sailing order vex stand cold floor job particular interest staunch disciplined means exit simple porch iron trellis easy reach window use anxious avoid public notice climb porch white rat night gown glimmer moment gravel walk lose sight darkness shrubbery brief interval silence ensue break sound scuffle shrill long draw squeal metallic surface friction scout fall hand enemy indolence devolve task investigation young brother danger declare hesitation second side porch crawl wise laurel back garden seat piteous sight greet seat white evening frock aunt nice lawn stand incense curate grasp small brother large ear judge row seem point part company head adorn gruesome noise emit affect try wail genuine physical anguish easy distinguishable pump misericordiam blubber recognise belong latter class young whelp maintain curate mean
