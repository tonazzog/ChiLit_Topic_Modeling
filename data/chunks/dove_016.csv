" EBBO trusted that his kinsman of Wildschloss was safe gone with the Court, and his temper smoothed and his spirits rose in proportion while preparations for a return to Adlerstein were being completed—preparations by which the burgher lady might hope to render the castle far more habitable, not to say baronial, than it had ever been. The lady herself felt thankful that her stay at Ulm had turned out well beyond all anticipations in the excellent understanding between her uncle and her sons, and still more in Ebbo’s full submission and personal loyalty towards the imperial family.  The die was cast, and the first step had been taken towards rendering the Adlerstein family the peaceful, honourable nobles she had always longed to see them. She was one afternoon assisting her aunt in some of the duties of her wirthschaft, when Master Gottfried entered the apartment with an air of such extreme complacency that both turned round amazed; the one exclaiming, “Surely funds have come in for finishing the spire!” the other, “Have they appointed thee Provost for next year, house-father?” “Neither the one nor the other,” was the reply.  “But heard you not the horse’s feet?  Here has the Lord of Adlerstein Wildschloss been with me in full state, to make formal proposals for the hand of our child, Christina.” “For Christina!” cried Hausfrau Johanna with delight; “truly that is well.  Truly our maiden has done honour to her breeding.  A second nobleman demanding her—and one who should be able richly to endow her!” “And who will do so,” said Master Gottfried.  “For morning gift he promises the farms and lands of Grünau—rich both in forest and corn glebe.  Likewise, her dower shall be upon Wildschloss—where the soil is of the richest pasture, and there are no less than three mills, whence the lord obtains large rights of multure.  Moreover, the Castle was added to and furnished on his marriage with the late baroness, and might serve a Kurfürst; and though the jewels of Freiherrinn Valeska must be inherited by her daughter, yet there are many of higher price which have descended from his own ancestresses, and which will all be hers.” “And what a wedding we will have!” exclaimed Johanna; “it shall be truly baronial.  I will take my hood and go at once to neighbour Sophie Lemsberg, who was wife to the Markgraf’s Under Keller-Meister.  She will tell me point device the ceremonies befitting the espousals of a baron’s widow.” Poor Christina had sat all this time with drooping head and clasped hands, a tear stealing down as the formal terms of the treaty sent her spirit back to the urgent, pleading, imperious voice that had said, “Now, little one, thou wilt not shut me out;” and as she glanced at the ring that had lain on that broad palm, she felt as if her sixteen cheerful years had been an injury to her husband in his nameless bloody grave. But protection was so needful in those rude ages, and second marriages so frequent, that reluctance was counted as weakness.  She knew her uncle and aunt would never believe that aught but compulsion had bound her to the rude outlaw, and her habit of submission was so strong that, only when her aunt was actually rising to go and consult her gossip, she found breath to falter, “Hold, dear aunt—my sons—” “Nay, child, it is the best thing thou couldst do for them.  Wonders hast thou wrought, yet are they too old to be without fatherly authority.  I speak not of Friedel; the lad is gentle and pious, though spirited, but for the baron.  The very eye and temper of my poor brother Hugh—thy father, Stine—are alive again in him.  Yea, I love the lad the better for it, while I fear.  He minds me precisely of Hugh ere he was ’prenticed to the weapon-smith, and all became bitterness.” “Ah, truly,” said Christina, raising her eyes “all would become bitterness with my Ebbo were I to give a father’s power to one whom he would not love.” “Then were he sullen and unruly, indeed!” said the old burgomaster with displeasure; “none have shown him more kindness, none could better aid him in court and empire.  The lad has never had restraint enough.  I blame thee not, child, but he needs it sorely, by thine own showing.” “Alas, uncle! mine be the blame, but it is over late.  My boy will rule himself for the love of God and of his mother, but he will brook no hand over him—least of all now he is a knight and thinks himself a man. Uncle, I should be deprived of both my sons, for Friedel’s very soul is bound up with his brother’s.  I pray thee enjoin not this thing on me,” she implored. “Child!” exclaimed Master Gottfried, “thou thinkst not that such a contract as this can be declined for the sake of a wayward Junker!” “Stay, house-father, the little one will doubtless hear reason and submit,” put in the aunt.  “Her sons were goodly and delightsome to her in their upgrowth, but they are well-nigh men.  They will be away to court and camp, to love and marriage; and how will it be with her then, young and fair as she still is?  Well will it be for her to have a stately lord of her own, and a new home of love and honour springing round her.” “True,” continued Sorel; “and though she be too pious and wise to reck greatly of such trifles, yet it may please her dreamy brain to hear that Sir Kasimir loves her even like a paladin, and the love of a tried man of six-and-forty is better worth than a mere kindling of youthful fancy.” “Mine Eberhard loved me!” murmured Christina, almost to herself, but her aunt caught the word. “And what was such love worth?  To force thee into a stolen match, and leave thee alone and unowned to the consequences!” “Peace!” exclaimed Christina, with crimson cheek and uplifted head. “Peace!  My own dear lord loved me with true and generous love!  None but myself knows how much.  Not a word will I hear against that tender heart.” “Yes, peace,” returned Gottfried in a conciliatory tone,—“peace to the brave Sir Eberhard.  Thine aunt meant no ill of him.  He truly would rejoice that the wisdom of his choice should receive such testimony, and that his sons should be thus well handled.  Nay, little as I heed such toys, it will doubtless please the lads that the baron will obtain of the Emperor letters of nobility for this house, which verily sprang of a good Walloon family, and so their shield will have no blank.  The Romish king promises to give thee rank with any baroness, and hath fully owned what a pearl thou art, mine own sweet dove!  Nay, Sir Kasimir is coming to-morrow in the trust to make the first betrothal with Graf von Kaulwitz as a witness, and I thought of asking the Provost on the other hand.” ",trust kinsman safe gone court temper smooth spirit rise proportion preparation return complete preparation burgher lady hope render castle habitable baronial lady feel thankful stay turn anticipation excellent understanding uncle son more full submission personal loyalty imperial family die cast first step rendering family peaceful honourable noble long afternoon assist aunt duty wirthschaft enter apartment air such extreme complacency turn amaze one exclaim fund finish spire other appoint next year house father one other reply hear horse foot full state formal proposal hand child cry delight well maiden honour breeding second nobleman demand able endow morning gift promise farm land rich forest corn glebe dower soil rich pasture less mill lord obtain large right multure add furnish marriage late baroness serve jewel inherit daughter many high price descend own ancestress wedding exclaim baronial hood neighbour wife point device ceremony befit espousal baron widow poor sit time droop head clasp hand tear steal formal term treaty send spirit urgent plead imperious voice one shut glance ring lain broad palm feel cheerful year injury husband nameless bloody grave protection needful rude age second marriage frequent reluctance count weakness uncle aunt believe aught compulsion bind rude outlaw habit submission strong aunt rise consult gossip find breath falter hold dear aunt son child thing wonder wring old fatherly authority speak lad gentle pious spirit baron very eye temper poor brother father alive love lad fear mind prentice weapon become bitterness raise eye become bitterness give father power love sullen unruly old burgomaster displeasure show more kindness aid court empire lad restraint blame child need own show uncle blame late boy rule love mother briok hand least knight man uncle deprive son soul bind brother pray enjoin thing implore child exclaim thinkst contract decline sake wayward stay house father one hear reason submit put aunt son goodly delightsome upgrowth nigh man court camp love marriage young fair stately lord own new home love honour spring true continue pious wise reck such trifle please dreamy brain hear love paladin love try man worth mere kindling youthful fancy love murmure aunt catch word such love worth force steal match leave alone unowned consequence peace exclaim crimson cheek uplift head peace own dear lord love true generous love much word hear tender heart peace return conciliatory tone peace brave aunt mean ill rejoice wisdom choice receive such testimony son handle heed such toy please lad baron obtain emperor letter nobility house spring walloon family shield blank king promise give rank baroness own pearl thou art own sweet dove trust first betrothal witness ask other hand 
"“To-morrow!” exclaimed Johanna; “and how is she to be meetly clad?  Look at this widow-garb; and how is time to be found for procuring other raiment?  House-father, a substantial man like you should better understand!  The meal too!  I must to gossip Sophie!” “Verily, dear mother and father,” said Christina, who had rallied a little, “have patience with me.  I may not lightly or suddenly betroth myself; I know not that I can do so at all, assuredly not unless my sons were heartily willing.  Have I your leave to retire?” “Granted, my child, for meditation will show thee that this is too fair a lot for any but thee.  Much had I longed to see thee wedded ere thy sons outgrew thy care, but I shunned proposing even one of our worthy guildmasters, lest my young Freiherr should take offence; but this knight, of his own blood, true and wise as a burgher, and faithful and God-fearing withal, is a better match than I durst hope, and is no doubt a special reward from thy patron saint.” “Let me entreat one favour more,” implored Christina.  “Speak of this to no one ere I have seen my sons.” She made her way to her own chamber, there to weep and flutter.  Marriage was a matter of such high contract between families that the parties themselves had usually no voice in the matter, and only the widowed had any chance of a personal choice; nor was this always accorded in the case of females, who remained at the disposal of their relatives.  Good substantial wedded affection was not lacking, but romantic love was thought an unnecessary preliminary, and found a vent in extravagant adoration, not always in reputable quarters.  Obedience first to the father, then to the husband, was the first requisite; love might shift for itself; and the fair widow of Adlerstein, telling her beads in sheer perplexity, knew not whether her strong repugnance to this marriage and warm sympathy with her son Ebbo were not an act of rebellion.  Yet each moment did her husband rise before her mind more vividly, with his rugged looks, his warm, tender heart, his dawnings of comprehension, his generous forbearance and reverential love—the love of her youth—to be equalled by no other.  The accomplished courtier and polished man of the world might be his superior, but she loathed the superiority, since it was to her husband.  Might not his one chosen dove keep heart-whole for him to the last?  She recollected that coarsest, cruellest reproach of all that her mother-in-law had been wont to fling at her,—that she, the recent widow, the new-made mother of Eberhard’s babes, in her grief, her terror, and her weakness had sought to captivate this suitor by her blandishments.  The taunt seemed justified, and her cheeks burned with absolute shame “My husband! my loving Eberhard! left with none but me to love thee, unknown to thine own sons!  I cannot, I will not give my heart away from thee!  Thy little bride shall be faithful to thee, whatever betide.  When we meet beyond the grave I will have been thine only, nor have set any before thy sons.  Heaven forgive me if I be undutiful to my uncle; but thou must be preferred before even him!  Hark!” and she started as if at Eberhard’s foot-step; then smiled, recollecting that Ebbo had his father’s tread.  But her husband had been too much in awe of her to enter with that hasty agitated step and exclamation, “Mother, mother, what insolence is this!” “Hush, Ebbo!  I prayed mine uncle to let me speak to thee.” “It is true, then,” said Ebbo, dashing his cap on the ground; “I had soundly beaten that grinning ’prentice for telling Heinz.” “Truly the house rings with the rumour, mother,” said Friedel, “but we had not believed it.” “I believed Wildschloss assured enough for aught,” said Ebbo, “but I thought he knew where to begin.  Does he not know who is head of the house of Adlerstein, since he must tamper with a mechanical craftsman, cap in hand to any sprig of nobility!  I would have soon silenced his overtures!” “Is it in sooth as we heard?” asked Friedel, blushing to the ears, for the boy was shy as a maiden.  “Mother, we know what you would say,” he added, throwing himself on his knees beside her, his arm round her waist, his cheek on her lap, and his eyes raised to hers. She bent down to kiss him.  “Thou knewst it, Friedel, and now must thou aid me to remain thy father’s true widow, and to keep Ebbo from being violent.” Ebbo checked his hasty march to put his hand on her chair and kiss her brow.  “Motherling, I will restrain myself, so you will give me your word not to desert us.” “Nay, Ebbo,” said Friedel, “the motherling is too true and loving for us to bind her.” “Children,” she answered, “hear me patiently.  I have been communing with myself, and deeply do I feel that none other can I love save him who is to you a mere name, but to me a living presence.  Nor would I put any between you and me.  Fear me not, Ebbo.  I think the mothers and sons of this wider, fuller world do not prize one another as we do.  But, my son, this is no matter for rage or ingratitude.  Remember it is no small condescension in a noble to stoop to thy citizen mother.” “He knew what painted puppets noble ladies are,” growled Ebbo. “Moreover,” continued Christina, “thine uncle is highly gratified, and cannot believe that I can refuse.  He understands not my love for thy father, and sees many advantages for us all.  I doubt me if he believes I have power to resist his will, and for thee, he would not count thine opposition valid.  And the more angry and vehement thou art, the more will he deem himself doing thee a service by overruling thee.” “Come home, mother.  Let Heinz lead our horses to the door in the dawn, and when we are back in free Adlerstein it will be plain who is master.” “Such a flitting would scarce prove our wisdom,” said Christina, “to run away with thy mother like a lover in a ballad.  Nay, let me first deal gently with thine uncle, and speak myself with Sir Kasimir, so that I may show him the vanity of his suit.  Then will we back to Adlerstein without leaving wounds to requite kindness.” Ebbo was wrought on to promise not to attack the burgomaster on the subject, but he was moody and silent, and Master Gottfried let him alone, considering his gloom as another proof of his need of fatherly authority, and as a peace-lover forbearing to provoke his fiery spirit.

"But when Sir Kasimir’s visit was imminent, and Christina had refused to make the change in her dress by which a young widow was considered to lay herself open to another courtship, Master Gottfried called the twins apart. “My young lords,” he said, “I fear me ye are vexing your gentle mother by needless strife at what must take place.” “Pardon me, good uncle,” said Ebbo, “I utterly decline the honour of Sir Kasimir’s suit to my mother.” Master Gottfried smiled.  “Sons are not wont to be the judges in such cases, Sir Eberhard.” “Perhaps not,” he answered; “but my mother’s will is to the nayward, nor shall she be coerced.” “It is merely because of you and your pride,” said Master Gottfried. “I think not so,” rejoined the calmer Friedel; “my mother’s love for my father is still fresh.” “Young knights,” said Master Gottfried, “it would scarce become me to say, nor you to hear, how much matter of fancy such love must have been towards one whom she knew but for a few short months, though her pure sweet dreams, through these long years, have moulded him into a hero. Boys, I verily believe ye love her truly.  Would it be well for her still to mourn and cherish a dream while yet in her fresh age, capable of new happiness, fuller than she has ever enjoyed?” “She is happy with us,” rejoined Ebbo. “And ye are good lads and loving sons, though less duteous in manner than I could wish.  But look you, you may not ever be with her, and when ye are absent in camp or court, or contracting a wedlock of your own, would you leave her to her lonesome life in your solitary castle?” Friedel’s unselfishness might have been startled, but Ebbo boldly answered, “All mine is hers.  No joy to me but shall be a joy to her.  We can make her happier than could any stranger.  Is it not so, Friedel?” “It is,” said Friedel, thoughtfully. “Ah, rash bloods, promising beyond what ye can keep.  Nature will be too strong for you.  Love your mother as ye may, what will she be to you when a bride comes in your way?  Fling not away in wrath, Sir Baron; it was so with your parents both before you; and what said the law of the good God at the first marriage?  How can you withstand the nature He has given?” “Belike I may wed,” said Ebbo, bluntly; “but if it be not for my mother’s happiness, call me man-sworn knight.” “Not so,” good-humouredly answered Gottfried, “but boy-sworn paladin, who talks of he knows not what.  Speak knightly truth, Sir Baron, and own that this opposition is in verity from distaste to a stepfather’s rule.” “I own that I will not brook such rule,” said Ebbo; “nor do I know what we have done to deserve that it should be thrust on us.  You have never blamed Friedel, at least; and verily, uncle, my mother’s eye will lead me where a stranger’s hand shall never drive me.  Did I even think she had for this man a quarter of the love she bears to my dead father, I would strive for endurance; but in good sooth we found her in tears, praying us to guard her from him.  I may be a boy, but I am man enough to prevent her from being coerced.” “Was this so, Friedel?” asked Master Gottfried, moved more than by all that had gone before.  “Ach, I thought ye all wiser.  And spake she not of Sir Kasimir’s offers?—Interest with the Romish king?—Yea, and a grant of nobility and arms to this house, so as to fill the blank in your scutcheon?” “My father never asked if she were noble,” said Ebbo.  “Nor will I barter her for a cantle of a shield.” “There spake a manly spirit,” said his uncle, delighted.  “Her worth hath taught thee how little to prize these gewgaws!  Yet, if you look to mingling with your own proud kind, ye may fall among greater slights than ye can brook.  It may matter less to you, Sir Baron, but Friedel here, ay, and your sons, will be ineligible to the choicest orders of knighthood, and the canonries and chapters that are honourable endowments.” Friedel looked as if he could bear it, and Eberhard said, “The order of the Dove of Adlerstein is enough for us.” “Headstrong all, headstrong all,” sighed Master Gottfried.  “One romantic marriage has turned all your heads.” The Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, unprepared for the opposition that awaited him, was riding down the street equipped point device, and with a goodly train of followers, in brilliant suits.  Private wooing did not enter into the honest ideas of the burghers, and the suitor was ushered into the full family assembly, where Christina rose and came forward a few steps to meet him, curtseying as low as he bowed, as he said, “Lady, I have preferred my suit to you through your honour-worthy uncle, who is good enough to stand my friend.” “You are over good, sir.  I feel the honour, but a second wedlock may not be mine.” “Now,” murmured Ebbo to his brother, as the knight and lady seated themselves in full view, “now will the smooth-tongued fellow talk her out of her senses.  Alack! that gipsy prophecy!” Wildschloss did not talk like a young wooer; such days were over for both; but he spoke as a grave and honourable man, deeply penetrated with true esteem and affection.  He said that at their first meeting he had been struck with her sweetness and discretion, and would soon after have endeavoured to release her from her durance, but that he was bound by the contract already made with the Trautbachs, who were dangerous neighbours to Wildschloss.  He had delayed his distasteful marriage as long as possible, and it had caused him nothing but trouble and strife; his children would not live, and Thekla, the only survivor, was, as his sole heiress, a mark for the cupidity of her uncle, the Count of Trautbach, and his almost savage son Lassla; while the right to the Wildschloss barony would become so doubtful between her and Ebbo, as heir of the male line, that strife and bloodshed would be well-nigh inevitable.  These causes made it almost imperative that he should re-marry, and his own strong preference and regard for little Thekla directed his wishes towards the Freiherrinn von Adlerstein.  He backed his suit with courtly compliments, as well as with representations of his child’s need of a mother’s training, and the twins’ equal want of fatherly guidance, dilating on the benefits he could confer on them. Christina felt his kindness, and had full trust in his intentions.  “No” was a difficult syllable to her, but she had that within her which could not accept him; and she firmly told him that she was too much bound to both her Eberhards.  But there was no daunting him, nor preventing her uncle and aunt from encouraging him.  He professed that he would wait, and give her time to consider; and though she reiterated that consideration would not change her mind, Master Gottfried came forward to thank him, and express his confidence of bringing her to reason. “While I, sir,” said Ebbo, with flashing eyes, and low but resentful voice, “beg to decline the honour in the name of the elder house of Adlerstein.” ",visit imminent refuse change dress young widow consider lay open courtship call twin young lord fear vex gentle mother needless strife place pardon uncle decline honour suit mother smile son wont judge such case answer mother will nayward coerce pride rejoin calmer mother love father fresh young knight become hear much matter fancy such love few short month pure sweet dream long year mould hero boy believe love mourn cherish dream fresh age capable new happiness fuller enjoy happy rejoin lad loving son duteous manner wish absent camp court contract wedlock own leave lonesome life solitary castle unselfishness startle answer joy joy happy stranger  rash blood promising keep nature strong love mother bride way fling wrath parent law first marriage withstand nature give wed mother happiness call knight answer boy swear paladin talk speak knightly truth own opposition verity distaste stepfather rule own briok such rule deserve thrust blame least uncle mother eye lead stranger hand drive man quarter love bear dead father strive endurance sooth find tear pray guard boy man prevent coerce ask move wise spake offer interest king grant nobility arm house fill blank scutcheon father ask noble barter cantle shield spake manly spirit uncle delighted worth teach prize gewgaw mingling own proud kind fall great slight briok matter less son ineligible choicest order knighthood canonry chapter honourable endowment bear order enough headstrong sigh romantic marriage turn head unprepared opposition await ride street equip point device goodly train follower brilliant suit private woo enter honest idea burgher suitor usher full family assembly rise few step meet curtsey low bow prefer suit honour worthy uncle stand friend sir feel honour second wedlock murmure brother knight lady seat full view smooth tongued fellow talk sense gipsy prophecy talk young wooer such day speak grave honourable man penetrate true esteem affection first meeting strike sweetness discretion endeavour release durance bind contract dangerous neighbour delay distasteful marriage possible cause trouble strife child live only survivor sole heiress mark cupidity uncle savage son right barony become doubtful heir male line strife bloodshed inevitable cause imperative own strong preference regard direct wish back suit courtly compliment representation child need mother training twin equal want fatherly guidance dilate benefit confer feel kindness full trust intention difficult syllable accept much bound daunting prevent uncle aunt encourage profess wait give time consider reiterate consideration change mind thank express confidence bring reason sir flash eye low resentful voice beg decline honour name elder house
