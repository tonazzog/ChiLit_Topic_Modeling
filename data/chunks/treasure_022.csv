"CHAPTER 23. The Ebb-tide Runs THE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained, lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was ""queer to handle till you knew her way."" Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on, and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping me down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be missed. First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold. The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream. One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the tide. So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to one, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water. This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was meditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into the current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp, and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water. With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth, and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two. Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind. All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed. One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:      ""But one man of her crew alive,      What put to sea with seventy-five."" And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on. At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough effort, cut the last fibres through. The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time, the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end, across the current. I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved straight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it. Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window. I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin. By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon the other's throat. I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near overboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious, encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness. The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so often: ",run coracle ample reason done safe boat person height weight buoyant clever seaway cross lop sided craft manage pleased more leeway else turn manoeuvre admit queer handle way way turn direction one bind most part time broadside sure ship tide fortune paddle pleased tide sweep lay fairway miss loom blot blacker darkness spar hull begin shape next moment seem far brisker grow current ebb hawser lay hold hawser taut bowstring current strong pull anchor hull blackness ripple current bubble chatter mountain stream cut sea gully hum tide occur recollection taut hawser cut thing dangerous kick horse foolhardy cut anchor coracle knock clean water bring full stop fortune favour abandon design light air begin blow south east south haul nightfall south west meditate puff catch force current great joy feel hawser slack grasp hand hold dip second water mind gully open tooth cut strand vessel swing lay quiet wait sever last strain lighten breath wind time hear sound loud voice cabin truth mind other thought give ear else begin pay more heed recognize coxswain gunner former day other course friend red night cap man bad drink drink listen drunken cry open stern window throw divine empty bottle tipsy plain angry oath fly hailstone explosion sure end blow time quarrel pass voice grumble low while next crisis turn pass result shore glow great camp fire burn shore side tree sing dull old dron sailor song droop quaver end verse end patience singer hear voyage more remember word man crew alive put sea ditty appropriate company meet such cruel loss morning buccaneer callous sea sail last breeze schooner sidl draw dark feel hawser slack more tough effort cut last fibre breeze action coracle sweep bow same time schooner begin turn heel spinn end end current wring fiend expect moment swamp find push coracle shove length clear dangerous neighbour give last impulsion hand light cord trail stern bulwark grasp first mere instinct hand find curiosity begin upper hand determine cabin window pull hand hand cord judge rise infinite risk height command roof slice interior cabin time schooner consort glide water fetched level camp fire ship talk sailor tread innumerable ripple incessant weltering splash eye window sill comprehend watchmen alarm glance sufficient glance durst unsteady skiff show hand companion lock deadly wrestle hand other throat drop thwart moment furious encrimsoned face sway smoky lamp shut eye let grow familiar darkness endless ballad end last whole diminish company camp fire break chorus hear
