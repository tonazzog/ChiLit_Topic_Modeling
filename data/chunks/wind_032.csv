" IT WAS Friday night, and Diamond, like the rest of the household, had had very little to eat that day. The mother would always pay the week’s rent before she laid out anything even on food. His father had been very gloomy--so gloomy that he had actually been cross to his wife. It is a strange thing how pain of seeing the suffering of those we love will sometimes make us add to their suffering by being cross with them. This comes of not having faith enough in God, and shows how necessary this faith is, for when we lose it, we lose even the kindness which alone can soothe the suffering. Diamond in consequence had gone to bed very quiet and thoughtful--a little troubled indeed. It had been a very stormy winter, and even now that the spring had come, the north wind often blew. When Diamond went to his bed, which was in a tiny room in the roof, he heard it like the sea moaning; and when he fell asleep he still heard the moaning. All at once he said to himself, “Am I awake, or am I asleep?” But he had no time to answer the question, for there was North Wind calling him. His heart beat very fast, it was such a long time since he had heard that voice. He jumped out of bed, and looked everywhere, but could not see her. “Diamond, come here,” she said again and again; but where the here was he could not tell. To be sure the room was all but quite dark, and she might be close beside him. “Dear North Wind,” said Diamond, “I want so much to go to you, but I can’t tell where.” “Come here, Diamond,” was all her answer. Diamond opened the door, and went out of the room, and down the stair and into the yard. His little heart was in a flutter, for he had long given up all thought of seeing her again. Neither now was he to see her. When he got out, a great puff of wind came against him, and in obedience to it he turned his back, and went as it blew. It blew him right up to the stable-door, and went on blowing. “She wants me to go into the stable,” said Diamond to himself, “but the door is locked.” He knew where the key was, in a certain hole in the wall--far too high for him to get at. He ran to the place, however: just as he reached it there came a wild blast, and down fell the key clanging on the stones at his feet. He picked it up, and ran back and opened the stable-door, and went in. And what do you think he saw? A little light came through the dusty window from a gas-lamp, sufficient to show him Diamond and Ruby with their two heads up, looking at each other across the partition of their stalls. The light showed the white mark on Diamond’s forehead, but Ruby’s eye shone so bright, that he thought more light came out of it than went in. This is what he saw. But what do you think he heard? He heard the two horses talking to each other--in a strange language, which yet, somehow or other, he could understand, and turn over in his mind in English. The first words he heard were from Diamond, who apparently had been already quarrelling with Ruby. “Look how fat you are Ruby!” said old Diamond. “You are so plump and your skin shines so, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.” “There’s no harm in being fat,” said Ruby in a deprecating tone. “No, nor in being sleek. I may as well shine as not.” “No harm?” retorted Diamond. “Is it no harm to go eating up all poor master’s oats, and taking up so much of his time grooming you, when you only work six hours--no, not six hours a day, and, as I hear, get along no faster than a big dray-horse with two tons behind him?--So they tell me.” “Your master’s not mine,” said Ruby. “I must attend to my own master’s interests, and eat all that is given me, and be sleek and fat as I can, and go no faster than I need.” “Now really if the rest of the horses weren’t all asleep, poor things--they work till they’re tired--I do believe they would get up and kick you out of the stable. You make me ashamed of being a horse. You dare to say my master ain’t your master! That’s your gratitude for the way he feeds you and spares you! Pray where would your carcass be if it weren’t for him?” “He doesn’t do it for my sake. If I were his own horse, he would work me as hard as he does you.” “And I’m proud to be so worked. I wouldn’t be as fat as you--not for all you’re worth. You’re a disgrace to the stable. Look at the horse next you. He’s something like a horse--all skin and bone. And his master ain’t over kind to him either. He put a stinging lash on his whip last week. But that old horse knows he’s got the wife and children to keep--as well as his drunken master--and he works like a horse. I daresay he grudges his master the beer he drinks, but I don’t believe he grudges anything else.” “Well, I don’t grudge yours what he gets by me,” said Ruby. “Gets!” retorted Diamond. “What he gets isn’t worth grudging. It comes to next to nothing--what with your fat and shine. “Well, at least you ought to be thankful you’re the better for it. You get a two hours’ rest a day out of it.” “I thank my master for that--not you, you lazy fellow! You go along like a buttock of beef upon castors--you do.” “Ain’t you afraid I’ll kick, if you go on like that, Diamond?” “Kick! You couldn’t kick if you tried. You might heave your rump up half a foot, but for lashing out--oho! If you did, you’d be down on your belly before you could get your legs under you again. It’s my belief, once out, they’d stick out for ever. Talk of kicking! Why don’t you put one foot before the other now and then when you’re in the cab? The abuse master gets for your sake is quite shameful. No decent horse would bring it on him. Depend upon it, Ruby, no cabman likes to be abused any more than his fare. But his fares, at least when you are between the shafts, are very much to be excused. Indeed they are.” “Well, you see, Diamond, I don’t want to go lame again.” “I don’t believe you were so very lame after all--there!” “Then I believe it was all your own fault. I’m not lame. I never was lame in all my life. You don’t take care of your legs. You never lay them down at night. There you are with your huge carcass crushing down your poor legs all night long. You don’t even care for your own legs--so long as you can eat, eat, and sleep, sleep. You a horse indeed!” “But I tell you I was lame.” “I’m not denying there was a puffy look about your off-pastern. But my belief is, it wasn’t even grease--it was fat.” “I tell you I put my foot on one of those horrid stones they make the roads with, and it gave my ankle such a twist.” “Ankle indeed! Why should you ape your betters? Horses ain’t got any ankles: they’re only pasterns. And so long as you don’t lift your feet better, but fall asleep between every step, you’ll run a good chance of laming all your ankles as you call them, one after another. It’s not your lively horse that comes to grief in that way. I tell you I believe it wasn’t much, and if it was, it was your own fault. There! I’ve done. I’m going to sleep. I’ll try to think as well of you as I can. If you would but step out a bit and run off a little of your fat!” Here Diamond began to double up his knees; but Ruby spoke again, and, as young Diamond thought, in a rather different tone. “I say, Diamond, I can’t bear to have an honest old horse like you think of me like that. I will tell you the truth: it was my own fault that I fell lame.” ",night rest household eat day mother pay week rent lay food father gloomy gloomy cross wife strange thing pain suffering love add suffering cross faith show necessary faith lose lose kindness soothe suffering diamond consequence bed quiet thoughtful troubled stormy winter spring north wind blow bed tiny room roof hear sea moan fall asleep hear moan awake asleep time answer question call heart beat fast long time hear voice jump bed sure room dark close dear want much answer open door room stair yard heart flutter give thought great puff wind obedience turn back blow blow stable door blow want stable door lock key certain hole wall high run place reach wild blast fall key clanging stone foot pick run open stable door light dusty window gas lamp sufficient show head other partition stall light show white mark forehead eye shine bright more light hear hear horse talk other strange language other understand turn mind first word hear quarrell fat old plump skin shine ashamed harm fat deprecating tone sleek shine harm retort harm eat poor master oat much time groom work hour hour day hear fast big dray horse ton master attend own master interest eat give sleek fat fast need rest horse asleep poor thing work tired believe kick stable ashamed horse dare master master gratitude way feed spare pray carcass sake own horse work proud work fat worth disgrace stable horse horse skin bone master kind put sting lash whip last week old horse wife child keep drunken master work horse grudge master beer drink believe grudge else grudge retort worth grudg next fat shine least thankful hour rest day thank master lazy fellow buttock beef castor afraid kick kick kick try heave rump foot lash belly leg belief stick talk kick put foot other cab abuse master sake shameful decent horse bring depend cabman like abuse more fare fare least shaft much excuse want lame believe lame believe own fault lame lame life care leg lay night huge carcass crush poor leg night care own leg eat eat sleep sleep horse lame deny puffy pastern belief grease fat put foot horrid stone road give ankle twist ankle ape better horse ankle pastern lift foot fall asleep step run chance lame ankle call lively horse grief way believe much own fault sleep try step bit run fat begin double knee speak young different tone bear honest old horse truth own fault fall lame
