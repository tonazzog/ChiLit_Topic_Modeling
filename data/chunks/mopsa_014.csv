"CHAPTER XIV. REEDS AND RUSHES.   'Tis merry, 'tis merry in Fairyland,     Where Fairy birds are singing;   When the court doth sit by the monarch's side,     With bit and bridle ringing.  There were many fruit-trees on that slope of the mountain, and Jack and Mopsa, as they came down, gathered some fruit for breakfast, and did not feel very tired, for the long ride on the wing had rested them. They could not see the plain, for a slight blue mist hung over it; but the sun was hot already, and as they came down they saw a beautiful bed of high reeds, and thought they would sit awhile and rest in it. A rill of clear water ran beside the bed, so when they had reached it they sat down, and began to consider what they should do next. ""Jack,"" said Mopsa, ""did you see anything particular as you came down with the shooting-stars?"" ""No, I saw nothing so interesting as they were,"" answered Jack. ""I was looking at them and watching how they squeaked to one another, and how they had little hooks in their wings, with which they held the large wing that we sat on."" ""But I saw something,"" said Mopsa. ""Just as the sun rose I looked down, and in the loveliest garden I ever saw, and all among trees and woods, I saw a most beautiful castle. O, Jack! I am sure that castle is the place I am to live in, and now we have nothing to do but to find it. I shall soon be a queen, and there I shall reign."" ""Then I shall be king there,"" said Jack; ""shall I?"" ""Yes, if you can,"" answered Mopsa. ""Of course, whatever you can do you may do. And, Jack, this is a much better fairy country than either the stony land or the other that we first came to, for this castle is a real place! It will not melt away. There the people can work, they know how to love each other: common fairies cannot do that, I know. They can laugh and cry, and I shall teach them several things that they do not know yet. Oh! do let us make haste and find the castle."" So they arose; but they turned the wrong way, and by mistake walked farther and farther in among the reeds, whose feathery heads puffed into Mopsa's face, and Jack's coat was all covered with the fluffy seed. ""This is very odd,"" said Jack. ""I thought this was only a small bed of reeds when we stepped into it; but really we must have walked a mile already."" But they walked on and on, till Mopsa grew quite faint, and her sweet face became very pale, for she knew that the beds of reeds were spreading faster than they walked, and then they shot up so high that it was impossible to see over their heads; so at last Jack and Mopsa were so tired that they sat down, and Mopsa began to cry. However, Jack was the braver of the two this time, and he comforted Mopsa, and told her that she was nearly a queen, and would never reach her castle by sitting still. So she got up and took his hand, and he went on before, parting the reeds and pulling her after him, till all on a sudden they heard the sweetest sound in the world; it was like a bell, and it sounded again and again. It was the castle clock, and it was striking twelve at noon. As it finished striking they came out at the farther edge of the great bed of reeds, and there was the castle straight before them,--a beautiful castle, standing on the slope of a hill. The grass all about it was covered with beautiful flowers; two of the taller turrets were overgrown with ivy, and a flag was flying on a staff; but everything was so silent and lonely that it made one sad to look on. As Jack and Mopsa drew near they trod as gently as they could, and did not say a word. All the windows were shut, but there was a great door in the centre of the building, and they went towards it, hand in hand. What a beautiful hall! The great door stood wide open, and they could see what a delightful place this must be to live in: it was paved with squares of blue and white marble, and here and there carpets were spread, with chairs and tables upon them. They looked and saw a great dome overhead, filled with windows of colored glass, and they cast down blue and golden and rosy reflections. ""There is my home that I shall live in,"" said Mopsa; and she came close to the door, and they both looked in, till at last she let go of Jack's hand, and stepped over the threshold. The bell in the tower sounded again more sweetly than ever, and the instant Mopsa was inside there came from behind the fluted columns, which rose up on every side, the brown doe, followed by troops of deer and fawns! ""Mopsa! Mopsa!"" cried Jack, ""come away! come back!"" But Mopsa was too much astonished to stir, and something seemed to hold Jack from following; but he looked and looked, till, as the brown doe advanced, the door of the castle closed,--Mopsa was shut in, and Jack was left outside. So Mopsa had come straight to the place she thought she had ran away from. ""But I am determined to get her away from those creatures,"" thought Jack; ""she does not want to reign over deer."" And he began to look about him, hoping to get in. It was of no use: all the windows in that front of the castle were high, and when he tried to go round, he came to a high wall with battlements. Against some parts of this wall the ivy grew, and looked as if it might have grown there for ages; its stems were thicker than his waist, and its branches were spread over the surface like network; so by means of them he hoped to climb to the top. He immediately began to try. Oh, how high the wall was! First he came to several sparrows' nests, and very much frightened the sparrows were; then he reached starlings' nests, and very angry the starlings were; but at last, just under the coping, he came to jackdaws' nests, and these birds were very friendly, and pointed out to him the best little holes for him to put his feet into. At last he reached the top, and found to his delight that the wall was three feet thick, and he could walk upon it quite comfortably, and look down into a lovely garden, where all the trees were in blossom, and creepers tossed their long tendrils from tree to tree, covered with puffs of yellow, or bells of white, or bunches and knots of blue or rosy bloom. He could look down into the beautiful empty rooms of the castle, and he walked cautiously on the wall till he came to the west front, and reached a little casement window that had latticed panes. Jack peeped in; nobody was there. He took his knife, and cut away a little bit of lead to let out the pane, and it fell with such a crash on the pavement below that he wondered it did not bring the deer over to look at what he was about. Nobody came. He put in his hand and opened the latchet, and with very little trouble got down into the room. Still nobody was to be seen. He thought that the room, years ago, might have been a fairies' school-room, for it was strewn with books, slates, and all sorts of copybooks. A fine soft dust had settled down over everything,--pens, papers, and all. Jack opened a copybook: its pages were headed with maxims, just as ours are, which proved that these fairies must have been superior to such as he had hitherto come among. Jack read some of them:-- ",reeds rushe merry fairy bird sing court sit monarch side bit bridle ringing many fruit tree slope mountain gather fruit breakfast feel tired long ride wing rest plain slight blue mist hang sun hot beautiful bed high reed sit rest rill clear water run bed reach sit begin consider particular shooting star interesting answer watch squeak hook wing hold large wing sit sun rise loveliest garden tree wood beautiful castle sure castle place live find queen reign king answer course fairy country stony land other castle real place melt person work love other common fairy laugh cry teach several thing let haste find castle arise turn wrong way mistake walk reed feathery head puff face coat cover fluffy seed odd small bed reed step walk mile walk grow faint sweet face become pale bed reed spread fast walk shoot high impossible head last tired sit begin cry brave time comfort queen reach castle sit hand part reed pull sudden hear sweetest sound world bell sound castle clock strike noon finish strike far edge great bed reed castle beautiful castle stand slope hill grass cover beautiful flower tall turret overgrown ivy flag fly staff silent lonely sad draw trod word window shut great door centre building hand hand beautiful hall great door stand open delightful place live paved square blue white marble carpet spread chair table great dome fill window colored glass cast blue golden rosy reflection home live door last let hand step threshold bell tower sound instant flute column rise side brown doe follow troops deer fawn cry astonished stir seem hold follow brown doe advance door castle close shut leave place run determined creature want reign deer begin hope use window front castle high try high wall battlement part wall ivy grow grow age stem thick waist branch spread surface network means hope climb top begin try high wall several sparrow nest frighten sparrow reach starling nest angry starling last coping jackdaw nest bird friendly point hole put foot last reach top find delight wall foot thick walk lovely garden tree blossom creeper toss long tendril tree tree cover puff yellow bell white bunch knot blue rosy bloom beautiful empty room castle walk wall west front reach casement window lattice pane peep knife cut bit lead let pane fall crash pavement wonder bring deer put hand open latchet trouble room room year fairy school room strewn book slate sort copybook fine soft dust settle pen paper open copybook page head maxim prove fairy superior such read
