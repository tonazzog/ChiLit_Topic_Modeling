" It was now April, and for some days Malachi and John had been very busy, assisted by the Strawberry; for the time had come for tapping the maple-trees, to make the maple-sugar, and Mrs. Campbell had expressed a wish that she could be so supplied with an article of such general consumption, and which they could not obtain but by the _bateaux_ which went to Montreal. In the evening, when Malachi and John were, as usual, employed in cutting small trays out of the soft wood of the balsam-fir, and of which they had already prepared a large quantity, Mrs. Campbell asked Malachi how the sugar was procured. ""Very easily, ma'am: we tap the trees."" ""Yes, so you said before; but how do you do it? Explain the whole affair to me."" ""Why, ma'am, we pick out the maple trees which are about a foot wide at the bottom of the trunk, as they yield most sugar. We then bore a hole in the trunk of the tree, about two feet above the ground, and into that hole we put a hollow reed, just the same as you would put a spigot in a cask. The liquor runs out into one of these trays that we have been digging out."" ""Well, and then what do you do?"" ""We collect all the liquor every morning till we have enough to fill the coppers, and then we boil it down."" ""What coppers will you use, then?"" ""There are two large coppers in the store-room, not yet put up, which will answer our purpose very well, ma'am. They hold about a hogshead each. We shall take them into the woods with us, and pour the liquor into them, and boil them down as soon as they are ready. You must come and see us on the boiling-day, and we can have a frolic in the woods."" ""With all my heart,"" replied Mrs. Campbell. ""How much liquor do you get from one tree?"" ""A matter of two or three gallons,"" replied Malachi; ""sometimes more and sometimes less. After we have tapped the trees and set our trays, we shall have nothing more to do for a fortnight. The Strawberry can attend to them all, and will let us know when she is ready."" ""Do you tap the trees every year?"" ""Yes, ma'am, and a good tree will bear it for fifteen or twenty years; but it kills them at last."" ""So I should suppose, for you take away so much of the sap of the tree."" ""Exactly, ma'am; but there's no want of sugar-maples in these woods."" ""You promised us some honey, Malachi,"" said Emma, ""but we have not seen it yet. Can you get us some?"" ""We had no time to get it last autumn, miss, but we will try this autumn what we can do. When John and I are out in the woods, we shall very probably find a honey-tree, without going very far. I did intend to have looked out for some, if you had not mentioned it."" ""I know one,"" said Martin, ""I marked it a fortnight ago, but I quite forgot all about it. Since the mill has been in hand, I have had little time for any thing else. The fact is, we have all plenty to do just now."" ""That we certainly have,"" replied Henry, laughing; ""I wish I could see the end of my work in the barn; I doubt if I shall be able to get out with my rifle this winter."" ""No, sir, you must leave the woods to John and me,"" replied Malachi. ""Never mind, you shan't want for venison. Do you require the sledge to-morrow, Mr. Alfred?"" Malachi referred to a small sledge which they had made in the winter, and which was now very useful, as they could, with one horse, transport things from place to place. It was used by Alfred for bringing down to the storehouse the sacks of flour as fast as they were ground in the mill. ""I can do without it for a day. What do you want it for?"" ""To bring all the honey home,"" said Emma laughing. ""No, miss, to take the coppers out into the woods,"" replied Malachi, ""that they may be ready for the liquor. As soon as we have tapped the trees, we will look for the honey."" ""Did you send your skins down to Montreal by the _bateaux_?"" inquired Mr. Campbell. ""Yes, father,"" replied Alfred; ""Mr. Emmerson took charge of them, and promised to deliver them to the agent; but we have not so many this year as we had last. John has the largest package of all of us."" ""Yes, he beats me this year,"" said Malachi; ""he always contrives to get the first shot. I knew that I should make a hunter of the boy. He might go out by himself now, and do just as well as I do."" The next morning Malachi went out into the woods, taking with him the coppers and all the trays on the sledge: during that day he was busy boring the trees and fitting the reed-pipes to the holes. Strawberry and John accompanied him, and by sunset their work was complete. The next morning when they went out, only Malachi and John took their axes with them, for John could use his very well for so young a lad. They first went to the tree which Martin had discovered; he had given a description where to find it. They cut it down, but did not attempt to take the honey till the night, when they lighted a fire, and drove away the bees by throwing leaves upon it, and making a great smoke; they then opened the tree, and gained about two pails full of honey, which they brought in just as the family were about to go to bed. When they went out the next morning, they found a bear very busy at the remains of the comb, but the animal made off before they could get a shot at him. Every morning the Strawberry collected all the sap which had run out of the trees, and poured it into the coppers which had been fixed up by Malachi, ready for a fire to be lighted under them. They continued their search, and found three more hives of bees, which they marked and allowed to remain till later in the season, when they could take them at their leisure. In a fortnight, they had collected sufficient liquor from the trees to fill both the coppers to the brim, besides several pails. The fires were therefore lighted under the coppers, and due notice given to Mrs. Campbell and the girls, that the next day they must go out into the woods and see the operation; as the liquor would, toward the afternoon, be turned into coolers, which were some of the large washing-tubs then in use, and which had been thoroughly cleansed for the purpose. As this was to be a holiday in the woods, they prepared a cold dinner in a large basket, and gave it in charge of Henry. Mr. Campbell joined the party, and they all set off to the spot, which was about two miles distant. On their arrival, they examined the trees and the trays into which the juice first ran, the boilers in which the liquor was now simmering over the fire, and asked questions of Malachi, so that they might, if necessary, be able to make the sugar themselves, after which the first cooler was filled with the boiling liquor, that they might see how the sugar crystallized as the liquor became cold. They then sat down under a large tree and dined. The tree was at some distance from the boilers, as there was no shade in the open spot where Malachi had placed them, and the afternoon was passed very agreeably in listening to Malachi's and Martin's stories of their adventures in the woods. While they were still at dinner, Oscar and the other dogs which had accompanied them had strayed to about a hundred yards distant, and were soon very busy scraping and barking at a large hole.
