"CHAPTER VII. HALF-A-CROWN.   So useful it is to have money, heigh ho!     So useful it is to have money!  The old hound went straight through the town, smelling Clink's footsteps, till he came into a large field of barley; and there, sitting against a sheaf, for it was harvest time, they found Clink-of-the-Hole. He was a very ugly little brown man, and he was smoking a pipe in the shade; while crouched near him was the poor little woman, with her hands spread before her face. ""Good-day, sir,"" said Clink to Jack. ""You are a stranger here, no doubt?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack; ""I only arrived this morning."" ""Have you seen the town?"" asked Clink, civilly; ""there is a very fine market."" ""Yes, I have seen the market,"" answered Jack. ""I went into it to buy a slave, but I did not see one that I liked."" ""Ah!"" said Clink; ""and yet they had some very fine articles."" Here he pointed to the poor little woman, and said, ""Now that's a useful body enough, and I had her very cheap."" ""What did you give for her?"" said Jack, sitting down. ""Three pitchers,"" said Clink, ""and fifteen cups and saucers, and two shillings in the money of the town."" ""Is their money like this?"" said Jack, taking out his shilling. When Clink saw the shilling he changed color, and said, very earnestly, ""Where did you get that, dear sir?"" ""Oh, it was given me,"" said Jack, carelessly. Clink looked hard at the shilling, and so did the fairy woman, and Jack let them look some time, for he amused himself with throwing it up several times and catching it. At last he put it back in his pocket, and then Clink heaved a deep sigh. Then Jack took out a penny, and began to toss that up, upon which, to his great surprise, the little brown man fell on his knees, and said, ""Oh, a shilling and a penny,--a shilling and a penny of mortal coin! What would I not give for a shilling and a penny!"" ""I don't believe you have got anything to give,"" said Jack, cunningly; ""I see nothing but that ring on your finger, and the old woman."" ""But I have a great many things at home, sir,"" said the brown man, wiping his eyes; ""and besides, that ring would be cheap at a shilling,--even a shilling of mortal coin."" ""Would the slave be cheap at a penny?"" said Jack. ""Would you give a penny for her, dear sir?"" inquired Clink, trembling with eagerness. ""She is honest,"" answered Jack; ""ask her whether I had better buy her with this penny."" ""It does not matter what she says,"" replied the brown man; ""I would sell twenty such as she is for a penny,--a real one."" ""Ask her,"" repeated Jack; and the poor little woman wept bitterly, but she said, ""No."" ""Why not?"" asked Jack; but she only hung down her head and cried. ""I'll make you suffer for this,"" said the brown man. But when Jack took out the shilling, and said, ""Shall I buy you with this, slave?"" his eyes actually shot out sparks, he was so eager. ""Speak!"" he said to the fairy woman; ""and if you don't say 'Yes,' I'll strike you."" ""He cannot buy me with that,"" answered the fairy woman, ""unless it is the most valuable coin he has got."" The brown man, on hearing this, rose up in a rage, and was just going to strike her a terrible blow, when Jack cried out, ""Stop!"" and took out his half-crown. ""Can I buy you with this?"" said he; and the fairy woman answered, ""Yes."" Upon this Clink drew a long breath, and his eyes grew bigger and bigger as he gazed at the half-crown. ""Shall she be my slave forever, and not yours,"" said Jack, ""if I give you this?"" ""She shall,"" said the brown man. And he made such a low bow, as he took the money, that his head actually knocked the ground. Then he jumped up; and, as if he was afraid Jack should repent of his bargain, he ran off towards the hole in the hill with all his might, shouting for joy as he went. ""Slave,"" said Jack, ""that is a very ragged old apron that you have got, and your gown is quite worn out. Don't you think we had better spend my shilling in buying you some new clothes? You look so very shabby."" ""Do I?"" said the fairy woman, gently. ""Well, master, you will do as you please."" ""But you know better than I do,"" said Jack, ""though you are my slave."" ""You had better give me the shilling, then,"" answered the little old woman; ""and then I advise you to go back to the boat, and wait there till I come."" ""What!"" said Jack; ""can you go all the way back into the town again? I think you must be tired, for you know you are so very old."" The fairy woman laughed when Jack said this, and she had such a sweet laugh that he loved to hear it; but she took the shilling, and trudged off to the town, and he went back to the boat, his hound running after him. He was a long time going, for he ran a good many times after butterflies, and then he climbed up several trees; and altogether he amused himself for such a long while that when he reached the boat his fairy woman was there before him. So he stepped on board, the hound followed, and the boat immediately began to swim on. ""Why, you have not bought any new clothes!"" said Jack to his slave. ""No, master,"" answered the fairy woman; ""but I have bought what I wanted."" And she took out of her pocket a little tiny piece of purple ribbon, with a gold-colored satin edge, and a very small tortoise-shell comb. When Jack saw these he was vexed, and said, ""What do you mean by being so silly? I can't scold you properly, because I don't know what name to call you by, and I don't like to say 'Slave,' because that sounds so rude. Why, this bit of ribbon is such a little bit that it's of no use at all. It's not large enough even to make one mitten of."" ""Isn't it?"" said the slave. ""Just take hold of it, master, and let us see if it will stretch."" So Jack did. And she pulled, and he pulled, and very soon the silk had stretched till it was nearly as large as a handkerchief; and then she shook it, and they pulled again. ""This is very good fun,"" said Jack; ""why now it is as large as an apron."" So she shook it again, and gave it a twitch here and a pat there; and then they pulled again, and the silk suddenly stretched so wide that Jack was very nearly falling overboard. So Jack's slave pulled off her ragged gown and apron, and put it on. It was a most beautiful robe of purple silk; it had a gold border, and it just fitted her. [JACK'S SLAVE. ""These are fairies,"" said Jack's slave; ""but what are you?""--PAGE 99.] ""That will do,"" she said. And then she took out the little tortoise-shell comb, pulled off her cap, and threw it into the river. She had a little knot of soft, gray hair, and she let it down, and began to comb. And as she combed the hair got much longer and thicker, till it fell in waves all about her throat. Then she combed again, and it all turned gold-color, and came tumbling down to her waist; and then she stood up in the boat, and combed once more, and shook out the hair, and there was such a quantity that it reached down to her feet, and she was so covered with it that you could not see one bit of her, excepting her eyes, which peeped out, and looked bright and full of tears.
