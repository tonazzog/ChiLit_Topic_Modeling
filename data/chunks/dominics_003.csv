"CHAPTER 2. A NEW BOY. ""Good-Bye, my boy; God bless you! and don't forget to tell the housekeeper about airing your flannel vests."" With this final benediction ringing in his ears, the train which was to carry Master Stephen Greenfield from London to Saint Dominic's steamed slowly out of the station, leaving his widowed mother to return lonely and sorrowful to the home from which, before this day, her youngest son had never wandered far without her. Stephen, if the truth must be told, was hardly as affected by the parting as his poor mother.  Not that he was not sorry to leave home, or that he did not love her he left behind; but with all the world before him, he was at present far too excited to think of anything rationally. Besides, that last remark about the flannel vests had greatly disturbed him.  The carriage was full of people, who must have heard it, and would be sure to set him down as no end of a milksop and mollycoddle. He blushed to the roots of his hair as he pulled up the window and sat down in his corner, feeling quite certain every one of his fellow-travellers must be secretly smiling at his expense.  He wished his mother would have whispered that last sentence.  It wasn't fair to him.  In short, Stephen felt a trifle aggrieved; and, with a view to manifesting his hardihood, and dispelling all false impressions caused by the maternal injunction, he let down the window and put his bare head out of it for about a quarter of an hour, until a speck of dust settled in his eye and drove him back to his seat. It is decidedly awkward to get dust in your eye when you want to figure as a hero, for the eyes will water, and must be wiped, and that looks particularly like weeping.  Stephen refrained from using his handkerchief as long as he could; but it was no use; he must wipe his eye in the presence of his fellow-passengers.  However, if he whistled a tune while doing so, no one could suspect him of real tears; so he struck up, ""Glide along, my bonny boat,"" as cheerfully as he could, and mopped his smarting eye at the same time.  Alas! the dust only got farther in, and the music, after half an hour's heroic perseverance, flagged altogether.  It was no use trying to appear heroic any longer, so, what with pain and a dawning sense of loneliness and home-sickness, Stephen shed a _few_ real tears into his handkerchief, an indulgence which did him good in every way, for it not only relieved his drooping spirits, but washed that wretched piece of dust fairly out of its hiding-place. This relief, with the aid of a bun and a bottle of ginger-beer at one of the stations, set him, so to speak, on his feet again, and he was able to occupy the rest of his journey very pleasantly in drumming his heels on the floor, and imagining to himself all the marvellous exploits which were to mark his career at Saint Dominic's.  He was to be a prodigy in his new school from the very first; in a few terms he was to be captain of the cricket club, and meanwhile was to gain the favour of the Sixth by helping them regularly in their lessons, and fighting any one against whom a special champion should be requisite.  He was, indeed, just being invited to dinner with the Doctor, who was about to consult him concerning some points of school management, when the train suddenly pulled up at Maltby, and his brother Oliver's head looked in at the window with a ""Hullo! here you are!  Tumble out!"" Oliver and Stephen were Mrs Greenfield's only children.  Their father had died twelve years ago, when Stephen was a baby, and the two boys had been left in charge of an uncle, who had carefully watched over their education, and persuaded his sister to allow her elder boy to go to a public school.  Mrs Greenfield had consented, with many tremblings, and Oliver had, four years ago, been sent to Saint Dominic's, where he was now one of the head boys in the Fifth Form.  Only a _few_ weeks before the opening of this story the boys' uncle had died, leaving in his will a provision for sending Stephen to the same school as his brother, or any other his mother might select.  The poor widow, loth to give up her boy, yet fain to accept the offer held out, chose to send Stephen to Saint Dominic's too, and this was the reason of that young gentleman's present appearance on the stage at that centre of learning. ""I'll send up your traps by the carter; we can walk,"" said Oliver, taking his young brother into charge. Stephen was only too glad, as it gave him time to breathe before plunging at once into the scene of his future exploits.  ""Is it far?"" he asked. ""Only a mile,"" said Oliver; ""come on.  Hullo, Rick, where have you been to?"" This was addressed to Ricketts, whom they met just outside the station. ""Oh! to Sherren's about my togs.  I wanted them for the match to-morrow, you know.  I've told him if he doesn't send them up in time we'll all get our things made in London, so I guess he'll hurry himself for once. Oh, look here! did you get a paper with the result of the American match?  Bother!  Here, you kid, what's your name, cut back to the station and get a daily.  Look sharp!  Bring it to me in my room.  Come on, Greenfield."" Master Stephen looked so astonished at this cool request from a total stranger that both the elder boys laughed. ""This is my young brother, Rick, just come--"" ""Oh, I beg your pardon,"" said Mr Ricketts, blushing, ""I'll go--"" ""No, I'll go,"" said Stephen, darting off, and expending a penny of his own to get this magnifico of the Fifth his paper. This little incident served to break the ice for the new boy, who felt highly honoured when Ricketts said he was ""much obliged to him."" ""By the way,"" said Oliver, suddenly, ""I ought to get my togs up too. Bother that Sherren!  I say, Rick, see my young brother up to the school, will you? while I cut back; he can wait in my study."" Stephen felt very desolate to be left thus alone the moment after his arrival, and it did not add to his pleasure to observe that Ricketts by no means appeared to look upon the task of seeing him to Saint Dominic's as a privilege.  They walked on in silence for about half a mile, and then encountered several groups of boys strolling out along the road. Ricketts stopped to talk to several of them, and was very nearly going off with one of the party, when he suddenly remembered his charge.  It was rather humiliating this, for Stephen; and already his triumphal entry into Saint Dominic's was beginning to be shorn of some of its glory.  No one noticed him; and the only one that paid him the least attention appeared to look upon him as a nuisance.
