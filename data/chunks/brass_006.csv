" Ventimore had so thoroughly convinced himself that the released Jinnee was purely a creature of his own imagination, that he rubbed his eyes with a start, hoping that they had deceived him. ""Stroke thy head, O merciful and meritorious one,"" said his visitor, ""and recover thy faculties to receive good tidings. For it is indeed I--Fakrash-el-Aamash--whom thou beholdest."" ""I--I'm delighted to see you,"" said Horace, as cordially as he could. ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" ""Nay, for hast thou not done me the greatest of all services by setting me free? To escape out of a bottle is pleasant. And to thee I owe my deliverance."" It was all true, then: he had really let an imprisoned Genius or Jinnee, or whatever it was, out of that bottle! He knew he could not be dreaming now--he only wished he were. However, since it was done, his best course seemed to be to put a good face on it, and persuade this uncanny being somehow to go away and leave him in peace for the future. ""Oh, that's all right, my dear sir,"" he said, ""don't think any more about it. I--I rather understood you to say that you were starting on a journey in search of Solomon?"" ""I have been, and returned. For I visited sundry cities in his dominions, hoping that by chance I might hear news of him, but I refrained from asking directly lest thereby I should engender suspicion, and so Suleyman should learn of my escape before I could obtain an audience of him and implore justice."" ""Oh, I shouldn't think that was likely,"" said Horace. ""If I were you, I should go straight back and go on travelling till I _did_ find Suleyman."" ""Well was it said: 'Pass not any door without knocking, lest haply that which thou seekest should be behind it.'"" ""Exactly,"" said Horace. ""Do each city thoroughly, house by house, and don't neglect the smallest clue. 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try, again!' as one of our own poets teaches."" ""'Try, try, try again,'"" echoed the Jinnee, with an admiration that was almost fatuous. ""Divinely gifted truly was he who composed such a verse!"" ""He has a great reputation as a sage,"" said Horace, ""and the maxim is considered one of his happiest efforts. Don't you think that, as the East is rather thickly populated, the less time you lose in following the poet's recommendation the better?"" ""It may be as thou sayest. But know this, O my son, that wheresoever I may wander, I shall never cease to study how I may most fitly reward thee for thy kindness towards me. For nobly it was said: 'If I be possessed of wealth and be not liberal, may my head never be extended!'"" ""My good sir,"" said Horace, ""do please understand that if you were to offer me any reward for--for a very ordinary act of courtesy, I should be obliged to decline it."" ""But didst thou not say that thou wast sorely in need of a client?"" ""That was so at the time,"" said Horace; ""but since I last had the pleasure of seeing you, I have met with one who is all I could possibly wish for."" ""I am indeed rejoiced to hear it,"" returned the Jinnee, ""for thou showest me that I have succeeded in performing the first service which thou hast demanded of me."" Horace staggered under this severe blow to his pride; for the moment he could only gasp: ""You--_you_ sent him to me?"" ""I, and no other,"" said the Jinnee, beaming with satisfaction; ""for while, unseen of men, I was circling in air, resolved to attend to thy affair before beginning my search for Suleyman (on whom be peace!), it chanced that I overheard a human being of prosperous appearance say aloud upon a bridge that he desired to erect for himself a palace if he could but find an architect. So, perceiving thee afar off seated at an open casement, I immediately transported him to the place and delivered him into thy hands."" ""But he knew my name--he had my card in his pocket,"" said Horace. ""I furnished him with the paper containing thy names and abode, lest he should be ignorant of them."" ""Well, look here, Mr. Fakrash,"" said the unfortunate Horace, ""I know you meant well--but _never_ do a thing like that again! If my brother-architects came to know of it I should be accused of most unprofessional behaviour. I'd no idea you would take that way of introducing a client to me, or I should have stopped it at once!"" ""It was an error,"" said Fakrash. ""No matter. I will undo this affair, and devise some other and better means of serving thee."" ""No, no,"" he said, ""for Heaven's sake, leave things alone--you'll only make them worse. Forgive me, my dear Mr. Fakrash, I'm afraid I must seem most ungrateful; but--but I was so taken by surprise. And really, I am extremely obliged to you. For, though the means you took were----were a little irregular, you have done me a very great service."" ""It is naught,"" said the Jinnee, ""compared to those I hope to render so great a benefactor."" ""But, indeed, you mustn't think of trying to do any more for me,"" urged Horace, who felt the absolute necessity of expelling any scheme of further benevolence from the Jinnee's head once and for all. ""You have done enough. Why, thanks to you, I am engaged to build a palace that will keep me hard at work and happy for ever so long."" ""Are human beings, then, so enamoured of hard labour?"" asked Fakrash, in wonder. ""It is not thus with the Jinn."" ""I love my work for its own sake,"" said Horace, ""and then, when I have finished it, I shall have earned a very fair amount of money--which is particularly important to me just now."" ""And why, my son, art thou so desirous of obtaining riches?"" ""Because,"" said Horace, ""unless a man is tolerably well off in these days he cannot hope to marry."" Fakrash smiled with indulgent compassion. ""How excellent is the saying of one of old: 'He that adventureth upon matrimony is like unto one who thrusteth his hand into a sack containing many thousands of serpents and one eel. Yet, if Fate so decree, he _may_ draw forth the eel.' And thou art comely, and of an age when it is natural to desire the love of a maiden. Therefore be of good heart and a cheerful eye, and it may be that, when I am more at leisure, I shall find thee a helpmate who shall rejoice thy soul."" ""Please don't trouble to find me anything of the sort!"" said Horace, hastily, with a mental vision of some helpless and scandalised stranger being shot into his dwelling like coals. ""I assure you I would much rather win a wife for myself in the ordinary way--as, thanks to your kindness, I have every hope of doing before long."" ""Is there already some damsel for whom thy heart pineth? If so, fear not to tell me her names and dwelling place, and I will assuredly obtain her for thee."" But Ventimore had seen enough of the Jinnee's Oriental methods to doubt his tact and discretion where Sylvia was concerned. ""No, no; of course not. I spoke generally,"" he said. ""It's exceedingly kind of you--but I _do_ wish I could make you understand that I am overpaid as it is. You have put me in the way to make a name and fortune for myself. If I fail, it will be my own fault. And, at all events, I want nothing more from you. If you mean to find Suleyman (on whom be peace!) you must go and live in the East altogether--for he certainly isn't over here; you must give up your whole time to it, keep as quiet as possible, and don't be discouraged by any reports you may hear. Above all, never trouble your head about me or my affairs again!"" ""O thou of wisdom and eloquence,"" said Fakrash, ""this is most excellent advice. I will go, then; but may I drink the cup of perdition if I become unmindful of thy benevolence!""

"And, raising his joined hands above his head as he spoke, he sank, feet foremost, through the carpet and was gone. ""Thank Heaven,"" thought Ventimore, ""he's taken the hint at last. I don't think I'm likely to see any more of him. I feel an ungrateful brute for saying so, but I can't help it. I can _not_ stand being under any obligation to a Jinnee who's been shut up in a beastly brass bottle ever since the days of Solomon, who probably had very good reasons for putting him there."" Horace next asked himself whether he was bound in honour to disclose the facts to Mr. Wackerbath, and give him the opportunity of withdrawing from the agreement if he thought fit. On the whole, he saw no necessity for telling him anything; the only possible result would be to make his client suspect his sanity; and who would care to employ an insane architect? Then, if he retired from the undertaking without any explanations, what could he say to Sylvia? What would Sylvia's father say to _him_? There would certainly be an end to his engagement. After all, he had not been to blame; the Wackerbaths were quite satisfied. He felt perfectly sure that he could justify their selection of him; he would wrong nobody by accepting the commission, while he would only offend them, injure himself irretrievably, and lose all hope of gaining Sylvia if he made any attempt to undeceive them. And Fakrash was gone, never to return. So, on all these considerations, Horace decided that silence was his only possible policy, and, though some moralists may condemn his conduct as disingenuous and wanting in true moral courage, I venture to doubt whether any reader, however independent, straightforward, and indifferent to notoriety and ridicule, would have behaved otherwise in Ventimore's extremely delicate and difficult position. Some days passed, every working hour of which was spent by Horace in the rapture of creation. To every man with the soul of an artist in him there comes at times--only too seldom in most cases--a revelation of latent power that he had not dared to hope for. And now with Ventimore years of study and theorising which he had often been tempted to think wasted began to bear golden fruit. He designed and drew with a rapidity and originality, a sense of perfect mastery of the various problems to be dealt with, and a delight in the working out of mass and detail, so intoxicating that he almost dreaded lest he should be the victim of some self-delusion. His evenings were of course spent with the Futvoyes, in discovering Sylvia in some new and yet more adorable aspect. Altogether, he was very much in love, very happy, and very busy--three states not invariably found in combination. And, as he had foreseen, he had effectually got rid of Fakrash, who was evidently too engrossed in the pursuit of Solomon to think of anything else. And there seemed no reason why he should abandon his search for a generation or two, for it would probably take all that time to convince him that that mighty monarch was no longer on the throne. ""It would have been too brutal to tell him myself,"" thought Horace, ""when he was so keen on having his case reheard. And it gives him an object, poor old buffer, and keeps him from interfering in my affairs, so it's best for both of us."" Horace's little dinner-party had been twice postponed, till he had begun to have a superstitious fear that it would never come off; but at length the Professor had been induced to give an absolute promise for a certain evening. On the day before, after breakfast, Horace had summoned his landlady to a consultation on the _menu_. ""Nothing elaborate, you know, Mrs. Rapkin,"" said Horace, who, though he would have liked to provide a feast of all procurable delicacies for Sylvia's refection, was obliged to respect her father's prejudices. ""Just a simple dinner, thoroughly well cooked, and nicely served--as you know so well how to do it."" ""I suppose, sir, you would require Rapkin to wait?"" As the ex-butler was liable to trances on these occasions during which he could do nothing but smile and bow with speechless politeness as he dropped sauce-boats and plates, Horace replied that he thought of having someone in to avoid troubling Mr. Rapkin; but his wife expressed such confidence in her husband's proving equal to all emergencies, that Ventimore waived the point, and left it to her to hire extra help if she thought fit. ""Now, what soup can you give us?"" he inquired, as Mrs. Rapkin stood at attention and quite unmollified. After protracted mental conflict, she grudgingly suggested gravy soup--which Horace thought too unenterprising, and rejected in favour of mock turtle. ""Well then, fish?"" he continued; ""how about fish?"" Mrs. Rapkin dragged the depths of her culinary resources for several seconds, and finally brought to the surface what she called ""a nice fried sole."" Horace would not hear of it, and urged her to aspire to salmon; she substituted smelts, which he opposed by a happy inspiration of turbot and lobster sauce. The sauce, however, presented insuperable difficulties to her mind, and she offered a compromise in the form of cod--which he finally accepted as a fish which the Professor could hardly censure for ostentation. Next came the no less difficult questions of _entrée_ or no _entrée_, of joint and bird. ""What's in season just now?"" said Horace; ""let me see""--and glanced out of the window as he spoke, as though in search of some outside suggestion.... ""Camels, by Jove!"" he suddenly exclaimed. ""_Camels_, Mr. Ventimore, sir?"" repeated Mrs. Rapkin, in some bewilderment; and then, remembering that he was given to untimely flippancy, she gave a tolerant little cough. ""I'll be shot if they _aren't_ camels!"" said Horace. ""What do _you_ make of 'em, Mrs. Rapkin?"" Out of the faint mist which hung over the farther end of the square advanced a procession of tall, dust-coloured animals, with long, delicately poised necks and a mincing gait. Even Mrs. Rapkin could not succeed in making anything of them except camels. ""What the deuce does a caravan of camels want in Vincent Square?"" said Horace, with a sudden qualm for which he could not account. ""Most likely they belong to the Barnum Show, sir,"" suggested his landlady. ""I did hear they were coming to Olympia again this year."" ""Why, of course,"" cried Horace, intensely relieved. ""It's on their way from the Docks--at least, it isn't _out_ of their way. Or probably the main road's up for repairs. That's it--they'll turn off to the left at the corner. See, they've got Arab drivers with them. Wonderful how the fellows manage them."" ""It seems to me, sir,"" said Mrs. Rapkin, ""that they're coming _our_ way--they seem to be stopping outside."" ""Don't talk such infernal---- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Rapkin; but why on earth should Barnum and Bailey's camels come out of their way to call on _me_? It's ridiculous, you know!"" said Horace, irritably. ""Ridicklous it _may_ be, sir,"" she retorted, ""but they're all layin' down on the road opposite our door, as you can see--and them niggers is making signs to you to come out and speak to 'em.""
