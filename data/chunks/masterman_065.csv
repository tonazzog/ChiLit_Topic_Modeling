"After returning twice for water, to satisfy those in the house, Mr Seagrave came to the assistance of William, who had been removing Ready's clothes to ascertain the nature of the wound he had received. ""We had better move him to where the other cocoa-nut boughs lie; he will be more comfortable there,"" said William. Ready whispered, ""More water.""  William gave him some more and then, with the assistance of his father, Ready was removed to a more comfortable place.  As soon as they laid him there, Ready turned on his side, and threw up a quantity of blood. ""I am better now,"" said he in a low voice; ""bind up the wound, William; an old man like me has not much blood to spare."" Mr Seagrave and William then examined the wound; the spear had gone deep into the lungs.  William threw off his shirt, tore it up into strips, and then bound up the wound so as to stop the effusion of blood. Ready, who at first appeared much exhausted with being moved about, gradually recovered so as to be able to speak in a low voice, when Mrs Seagrave came out of the house. ""Where is that brave, kind man?"" cried she, ""that I may bless him and thank him."" Mr Seagrave went to her, and caught her by the arm.  ""He is hurt, my dear; and very much hurt.  I did not tell you at the time."" Mr Seagrave related what had occurred, and then led her to where Ready was lying.  Mrs Seagrave knelt by his side, took his hand, and burst into tears. ""Don't weep for me,"" said Ready; ""my days have been numbered; I'm only sorry that I cannot any more be useful to you."" ""Dear good man,"" said Mrs Seagrave, ""whatever may be our fates, and that is for the Almighty to decide for us, as long as I have life, what you have done for me and mine shall never be forgotten."" Mrs Seagrave then bent over him, and kissing his forehead, rose and retired weeping into the house. ""William,"" said Ready, ""I can't talk now; raise my head a little, and then leave me.  You have not looked round lately.  Come again in about half an hour.  Leave me now, Mr Seagrave; I shall be better if I doze a little."" They complied with Ready's request; went up to the planks, and examined carefully all round the stockade; at last they stopped. ""This is a sad business, William,"" said Mr Seagrave. William shook his head.  ""He would not let me go,"" replied he; ""I wish he had.  I fear that he is much hurt."" ""I should say that he cannot recover, William.  We shall miss him to-morrow if they attack us."" ""I hardly know what to say, papa; but I feel that since we have been relieved, I am able to do twice as much as I could have done before."" ""I feel the same, but still with such a force against us, two people cannot do much."" ""If my mother and Juno load the muskets for us,"" replied William, ""we shall at all events do as much now as we should have been able to do if there were three, so exhausted as we should have been."" ""Perhaps so; at all events we will do our best, for we fight for our lives and for those most dear to us."" William went softly up to Ready, and found that he was dozing; he therefore did not disturb him, but returned to his father.  Now that their thirst had been appeased, they all felt the calls of hunger.  Juno and William went and cut off steaks from the turtle, and fried them; they all made a hearty meal, and perhaps never had they taken one with so much relish in their lives. It was nearly daylight, when William, who had several times been softly up to Ready, found him with his eyes open. ""How do you find yourself, Ready?"" said William. ""I am quiet and easy, William, and without much pain; but I think I am sinking, and shall not last long.  Recollect that if you are obliged to escape from the stockade, you take no heed of me, but leave me where I am.  I cannot live, and were you to move me, I should only die the sooner."" ""I had rather die with you, than leave you, Ready."" ""No, that is wrong; you must save your mother, and your brothers and sister; promise me that you will do as I wish."" William hesitated. ""I point out to you your duty, William.  I know what your feelings are, but you must not give way to them; promise me this, or you will make me very miserable."" William squeezed Ready's hand; his heart was too full to speak. ""They will come at daylight, William; you have not much time to spare; climb to the look-out, and wait there till day dawns; watch them as long as you can, and then come and tell me what you have seen."" Ready's voice became faint after this exertion of speaking so much. William immediately climbed up the cocoa-nut tree, and waited there till daylight.  At the dawn of day, he perceived that the savages were at work, that they had collected all the faggots together opposite to where the old house had stood, and were very busy in making arrangements for the attack.  At last, every one shouldered a faggot, and commenced their advance towards the stockade; William immediately descended and called his father, who was talking with Mrs Seagrave.  The muskets were all loaded, and Mrs Seagrave and Juno took their posts below the planking, to reload them as fast as they were fired. ""We must fire upon them as soon as we are sure of not missing, William,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""for the more we check their advance, the better."" When the first savages were within fifty yards, they both fired, and two of the men dropped; they continued to fire as their assailants came up, with great success for the first ten minutes; after which the savages advanced in a larger body, and took the precaution to hold the faggots in front of them, for some protection as they approached.  By these means they gained the stockade in safety, and commenced laying their faggots.  Mr Seagrave and William still kept up an incessant fire upon them, but not with so much success as before. Although many fell, the faggots were gradually heaped up, till they almost reached to the holes between the palisades, through which they pointed their muskets; and as the savages contrived to slope them down from the stockade to the ground, it was evident that they meant to mount up and take them by escalade.  At last, it appeared as if all the faggots had been placed, and the savages retired farther back, to where the cocoa-nut trees were still standing. ""They have gone away, father,"" said William; ""but they will come again, and I fear it is all over with us."" ""I fear so too, my boy,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""they are only retreating to arrange for a general assault, and they now will be able to gain an entrance.  I almost wish that they had fired the faggots; we might have escaped as Ready pointed out to us, but now I fear we have no chance."" ""Don't say a word to my mother,"" said William; ""let us defend ourselves to the last, and if we are overpowered it is the will of God."" ""I should like to take a farewell embrace of your dear mother,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""but, no; it will be weakness just now.  Here they come, William, in a swarm.  Well, God bless you, my boy; we shall all, I trust, meet in Heaven!"" The whole body of savages were now advancing from the cocoa-nut wood in a solid mass; they raised a yell, which struck terror into the hearts of Mrs Seagrave and Juno, yet they flinched not.  The savages were again within fifty yards of them, when the fire was opened upon them; the fire was answered by loud yells, and the savages had already reached to the bottom of the sloping pile of faggots, when the yells and the reports of the muskets were drowned by a much louder report, followed by the crackling and breaking of the cocoa-nut trees, which made both parties start with surprise; another and another followed, the ground was ploughed up, and the savages fell in numbers.
