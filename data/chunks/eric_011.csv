"                     ""And either greet him not      Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more      Than if not looked on.""--TROILUS AND CRESSIDA, iii. 3. Upton, expatriated from his study, was allowed to use one of the smaller class-rooms which were occupied during play-hours by those boys who were too high in the school for ""the boarders' room,"" and who were waiting to succeed to the studies as they fell vacant. There were three or four others with him in this class-room, and although it was less pleasant than his old quarters, it was yet far more comfortable than the Pandemonium of the shell and fourth-form boys. As a general rule, no boys were allowed to sit in any of the class-rooms except their legitimate occupants. The rule, however, was very generally overlooked, and hence Eric, always glad of an opportunity to escape from the company of Barker and his associates, became a constant frequenter of his friend's new abode. Here they used to make themselves very comfortable. Joining the rest, they would drink coffee or chocolate, and amuse themselves over the fire with Punch, or some warlike novel in a green or yellow cover. One of them very often read aloud to the rest: and Eric, being both a good reader and a merry, intelligent listener, soon became quite a favorite among the other boys. Mr. Rose had often seen him sitting there, and left him unmolested; but if ever Mr. Gordon happened to come in and notice him, he invariably turned him out, and after the first offence or two, had several times set him an imposition. This treatment gave fresh intensity to his now deeply-seated disgust at his late master, and his expressions of indignation at ""Gordon's spite"" were loud and frequent. One day Mr. Gordon had accidentally come in, and found no one there but Upton and Eric; they were standing very harmlessly by the window, with Upton's arm resting kindly on Eric's shoulder as they watched with admiration the net-work of rippled sunbeams that flashed over the sea. Upton had just been telling Eric the splendid phrase [Greek: anêrithmon gelasma pontiôn], which he had stumbled upon in an Aeschylus lesson that morning, and they were trying which would hit on the best rendering of it. Eric stuck up for the literal sublimity of ""the innumerable laughter of the sea,"" while Upton was trying to win him over to ""the many-twinkling smile of ocean."" They were enjoying the discussion, and each stoutly maintaining his own rendering, when Mr. Gordon entered. On this occasion he was particularly angry; he had an especial dislike of seeing the two boys together, because he fancied that the younger had grown more than usually conceited and neglectful, since he had been under the fifth-form patronage; and he saw in Eric's presence there, a new case of wilful disobedience. ""Williams, here _again!_"" he exclaimed sharply. ""Why, sir, you seem to suppose that you may defy rules with impunity! How often have I told you that no one is allowed to sit here, except the regular occupants?"" His voice startled the two boys from their pleasant discussion. ""No other master takes any notice of it, sir,"" said Upton. ""I have nothing to do with other masters, Williams, you will bring me the fourth Georgic, written out by Saturday morning, for your repeated disobedience. Upton, I have a great mind to punish you also, for tempting him to come here."" This was a mistake on Mr. Gordon's part, of which Upton took immediate advantage. ""I have no power to prevent it, sir, if he wishes it. Besides,"" he continued, with annoying blandness of tone, ""it would be inhospitable; and I am too glad of his company."" Eric smiled, and Mr. Gordon frowned. ""Williams, leave the room instantly."" The boy obeyed slowly and doggedly. ""Mr. Rose never interferes with me, when he sees me here,"" he said as he retreated. ""Then I shall request Mr. Rose to do so in future; your conceit and impertinence are getting intolerable."" Eric only answered with a fiery glance; the next minute Upton joined him on the stairs, and Mr. Gordon heard them laughing a little ostentatiously, as they ran out into the playground together. He went away full of strong contempt, and from that moment began to look on the friends as two of the worst boys in the school. This incident had happened on Thursday, which was a half-holiday, and instead of being able to join in any of the games, Eric had to spend that weary afternoon in writing away at the fourth Georgic; Upton staying in a part of the time to help him a little, by dictating the lines to him--an occupation not unfrequently interrupted by storms of furious denunciation against Mr. Gordon's injustice and tyranny; Eric vowing ""that he would pay him out somehow yet."" The imposition was not finished that evening, and it again consumed some of the next day's leisure, part of it being written between schools in the forbidden class-room. Still it was not quite finished on Friday afternoon at six, when school ended, and Eric stayed a few minutes behind the rest to scribble off the last ten lines; which done, he banged down the lid of his desk, not locking it, and ran out. The next morning an incident happened which involved considerable consequences to some of the actors in my story. Mr. Rose and several other masters had not a room to themselves, like Mr. Gordon, but heard their forms in the great hall. At one end of this hall was a board used for the various school notices, to which there were always affixed two or three pieces of paper containing announcements about examinations and other matters of general interest. On Saturday morning (when Eric was to give up his Georgic), the boys, as they dropped into the hall for morning school, observed a new notice on the board, and, thronging round to see what it was, read these words, written on a half-sheet of paper, attached by wafers to the board-- ""GORDON IS A SURLY DEVIL."" As may be supposed, so completely novel an announcement took them all very much by surprise, and they wondered who had been so audacious as to play this trick. But their wonder was cut short by the entrance of the masters, and they all took their seats, without any one tearing down the dangerous paper. After a few minutes the eye of the second master, Mr. Ready, fell on the paper, and, going up, he read it, stood for a moment transfixed with astonishment, and then called Mr. Rose. Pointing to the inscription, he said: ""I think we had better leave that there, Rose, exactly as it is, till Dr. Rowlands has seen it. Would you mind asking him to step in here?"" Just at this juncture Eric came in, having been delayed by Mr. Gordon while he rigidly inspected the imposition. As he took his seat, Montagu, who was next him, whispered-- ""I say, have you seen the notice-board?""

"""Why, some fellow has been writing up an opinion of Gordon not very favorable."" ""And serve him right, too, brute!"" said Eric, smarting with the memory of his imposition. ""Well, there'll be no end of a row; you'll see."" During this conversation, Dr. Rowlands came in with Mr. Rose. He read the paper, frowned, pondered a moment, and then said to Mr. Rose--""Would you kindly summon the lower school into the hall? As it would be painful to Mr. Gordon to be present, you had better explain to him how matters stand."" ""Halloa! here's a rumpus!"" whispered Montagu; ""he never has the lower school down for nothing."" A noise was heard on the stairs, and in flocked the lower school. When they had ranged themselves on the vacant forms, there was a dead silence and hush of expectation. ""I have summoned you all together,"" said the Doctor, ""on a most serious occasion. This morning, on coming into the school-room, the masters found that the notice-board had been abused for the purpose of writing up an insult to one of our number, which is at once coarse and wicked. As only a few of you have seen it, it becomes my deeply painful duty to inform you of its purport; the words are these--'Gordon is a surly devil.'""--A _very_ slight titter followed this statement, which was instantly succeeded by a sort of thrilling excitement; but Eric, when he heard the words, started perceptibly, and colored as he caught Montagu's eye fixed on him. Dr. Rowlands continued--""I suppose this dastardly impertinence has been perpetrated by some boy out of a spirit of revenge. I am perfectly amazed at the unparalleled audacity and meanness of the attempt, and it may be very difficult to discover the author of it. But, depend upon it, discover him _we will_, at whatever cost. Whoever the offender may be, and he must be listening to me at this moment, let him be assured that he shall _not_ be unpunished. His guilty secret shall be torn from him. His punishment can only be mitigated by his instantly yielding himself up."" No one stirred, but during the latter part of this address Eric was so uneasy, and his cheek burned with such hot crimson, that several eyes were upon him, and the suspicions of more than one boy were awakened. ""Very well,"" said the head master, ""the guilty boy is not inclined to confess. Mark, then; if his name has not been given up to me by to-day week, every indulgence to the school will be forfeited, the next whole holiday stopped, and the coming cricket-match prohibited."" ""The handwriting may be some clue,"" suggested Mr. Ready. ""Would you have any objection to my examining the note-books of the Shell?"" ""None at all. The Shell-boys are to show their books to Mr. Ready immediately."" The head-boy of the Shell collected the books, and took them to the desk; the three masters glanced casually at about a dozen, and suddenly stopped at one. Eric's heart beat loud, as his saw Mr. Rose point towards him. ""We have discovered a handwriting which remarkably resembles that on the board. I give the offender one more chance of substituting confession for detection."" No one stirred; but Montagu felt that his friend was trembling violently. ""Eric Williams, stand out in the room."" Blushing scarlet, and deeply agitated, the boy obeyed ""The writing on the notice is exactly like yours. Do you know anything of this shameful proceeding?"" ""Nothing, sir,"" he murmured in a low tone. ""Nothing whatever, sir."" Dr. Rowlands' look searched him through and through, and seemed to burn into his heart. He did not meet it, but hung his head. The Doctor felt certain from his manner that he was guilty. He chained him to the spot with his glance for a minute or two, and then said slowly, and with a deep sigh-- ""Very well; I _hope_ you have spoken the truth; but whether you have or no, we shall soon discover. The school, and especially the upper boys, will remember what I have said. I shall now tear down the insulting notice, and put it into your hands, Avonley, as head of the school, that you may make further inquiries."" He left the room, and the boys resumed their usual avocation till twelve o'clock. But poor Eric could hardly get through his ordinary pursuits; he felt sick and giddy, until everybody noticed his strange embarrassed manner, and random answers. No sooner had twelve o'clock struck, than the whole school broke up into knots of buzzing and eager talkers. ""I wonder who did it,"" said a dozen voices at once. ""The writing was undoubtedly Williams',"" suggested some. ""And did you notice how red and pale he got when the Doctor spoke to him, and how he hung his head?"" ""Yes; and one knows how he hates Gordon."" ""Ay; by the bye, Gordon set him a Georgic only on Thursday, and he has been swearing at him ever since."" ""I noticed that he stayed in after all the rest last night,"" said Barker. ""Did he? By Jove, that looks bad."" ""Has any one charged him with it?"" asked Duncan. ""Yes,"" answered one of the group: ""but he's as proud about it as Lucifer, and is furious if you mention it to him. He says we ought to know him better than to think him capable of such a thing."" ""And quite right, too,"" said Duncan. ""If he did it, he's done something totally unlike what one would have believed possible of him."" The various items of evidence were put together, and certainly they seemed to prove a strong case against Eric. In addition to the probabilities already mentioned, it was found that the ink used was of a violet color, and a peculiar kind, which Eric was known to patronise; and not only so, but the wafers with which the paper had been attached to the board were yellow, and exactly of the same size with some which Eric was said to possess. How the latter facts had been discovered, nobody exactly knew, but they began to be very generally whispered throughout the school. In short, the almost universal conviction among the boys proclaimed that he was guilty, and many urged him to confess it at once, and save the school from the threatened punishment. But he listened to such suggestions with the most passionate indignation. ""What!"" he said, angrily, ""tell a wilful lie to blacken my own innocent character? Never!"" The consequence was, they all began to shun him. Eric was put into Coventry. Very few boys in the school still clung to him, and maintained his innocence in spite of appearances, but they were the boys whom he had most loved and valued, and they were most vigorous in his defence. They were Russell, Montagu, Duncan, Owen, and little Wright. On the evening of the Saturday, Upton had sought out Eric, and said in a very serious tone, ""This is a bad business, Williams. I cannot forget how you have been abusing Gordon lately, and though I won't believe you guilty, yet you ought to explain."" ""What? even _you_, then suspect me?"" said Eric, bursting into proud tears. ""Very well. I shan't condescend to _deny_ it. I won't speak to you again till you have repented of mistrusting me;"" and he resolutely rejected all further overtures on Upton's part. He was alone in his misery. Some one, he perceived, had plotted to destroy his character, and he saw too clearly how many causes of suspicion told against him. But it was very bitter to think that the whole school could so readily suppose that he would do a thing which from his soul he abhorred. ""No,"" he thought, ""bad I may be, but I _could_ not have done such a base and cowardly trick.""
