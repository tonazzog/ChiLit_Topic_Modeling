"CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!’ ‘I couldn’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven jogged my elbow.’ On which Seven looked up and said, ‘That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!’ ‘YOU’D better not talk!’ said Five. ‘I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!’ ‘What for?’ said the one who had spoken first. ‘That’s none of YOUR business, Two!’ said Seven. ‘Yes, it IS his business!’ said Five, ‘and I’ll tell him--it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.’ Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust things--’ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. ‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting those roses?’ Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to--’ At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely ‘Who is this?’ She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. ‘Idiot!’ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, ‘What’s your name, child?’ ‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, ‘Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’ ‘And who are THESE?’ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. ‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. ‘It’s no business of MINE.’ The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed ‘Off with her head! Off--’ ‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said ‘Consider, my dear: she is only a child!’ The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave ‘Turn them over!’ The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. ‘Get up!’ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. ‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen. ‘You make me giddy.’ And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, ‘What HAVE you been doing here?’ ‘May it please your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were trying--’ ‘I see!’ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. ‘Off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. ‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. ‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen. ‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply. ‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen. ‘Can you play croquet?’ The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. ‘Yes!’ shouted Alice. ‘Come on, then!’ roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. ‘It’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. ‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘--where’s the Duchess?’ ‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘She’s under sentence of execution.’ ‘What for?’ said Alice. ‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked. ‘No, I didn’t,’ said Alice: ‘I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said “What for?”’ ‘She boxed the Queen’s ears--’ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. ‘The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said--’ ‘Get to your places!’ shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ about once in a minute. Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, ‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!’ ",ground large rose tree stand entrance garden rose grow white gardener paint red curious thing watch hear splash paint help sulky tone jogge elbow right lay blame other talk hear yesterday deserve behead one speak business business bring cook tulip root onion flung brush begin unjust thing eye chance fall stand watch check other bow low paint rose begin low voice fact red rose tree put white one mistake find head cut moment garden call gardener throw flat face sound many footstep eager soldier carry club shape gardener oblong flat hand foot corner courtier ornament diamond walk soldier royal child dear jump hand hand couple ornament heart guest recognise white talk hurry nervous manner smile notice follow carry crown crimson velvet cushion last grand procession king queen hearts doubtful lie face gardener remember hear rule procession use procession person lie face stand wait procession stop bow smile reply idiot toss head turn name child name add pack card afraid point gardener lie rosetree lie face pattern back same rest pack gardener soldier courtier own child surprise own courage business turn crimson fury glaring moment wild beast scream head nonsense silent lay hand arm consider dear child turn turn foot shrill loud voice gardener jump begin bow royal child else leave scream giddy turn rose tree humble tone knee speak try examine rose head procession move soldier remain execute unfortunate gardener run protection behead put large flower pot stand soldier wander minute march other head shout head gone please majesty soldier shout reply right shout play croquet soldier silent question mean shout roar join procession wonder happen fine day timid voice side walk white peep face  low hurry tone shoulder speak raise tiptoe put mouth close ear whisper sentence execution  pity ask pity box ear begin give scream laughter whisper frighten tone hear place shout voice thunder person begin run direction tumble other settle minute game begin curious croquet ground life ridge furrow ball live hedgehog mallet live flamingoe soldier double stand hand foot arche chief difficulty find first manage flamingo succeed body tuck arm leg hang neck straighten give hedgehog blow head twist face puzzle expression help burst laugh head begin provoking find hedgehog unroll act crawl ridge furrow way want send hedgehog double soldier walk other part ground conclusion difficult game player play wait turn quarrell while fight hedgehog short time furious passion stamp shouting head head minute begin feel uneasy sure dispute happen minute become fond behead person great wonder one leave alive
