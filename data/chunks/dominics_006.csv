"CHAPTER 5. SHAKING DOWN TO WORK. ""Master Greenfield, junior, is to go to the head master's study at half-past nine,"" called out Mr Roach, the school porter, putting his head into the dormitory, at seven o'clock next morning. Stephen had been up an hour, making fearful and wonderful shots of answers to his awful questions, half of which he had already ticked off as done for better or worse.  ""If I write _something_ down to each,"" thought he to himself, ""I might happen to get one thing right; it'll be better than putting down no answer at all."" ""Half-past nine!"" said he to Paul, on hearing this announcement; ""_ten_ was the time I was told."" ""Who told you?"" ""The gentleman who gave me my paper."" ""What paper? you don't have papers.  It's _viva voce_."" ""I've got a paper, anyhow,"" said Stephen, ""and a precious hard one, too, and I've only half done it."" ""Well, you'll have to go at half-past nine, or you'll catch it,"" said Paul.  ""I say, there's Loman calling you."" Stephen, who, since the indignation meeting last night, had felt himself grow very rebellious against the monitors, did not choose to hear the call in question, and tried his hardest to make another shot at his paper.  But he could not keep deaf when Loman himself opened the door, and pulling his ear inquired what he meant by not coming when he was told?  The new boy then had to submit, and sulkily followed his lord to his study, there to toast some bread at a smoky fire, and look for about half an hour for a stud that Loman said had rolled under the chest of drawers, but which really had fallen into one of that gentleman's boots. By the time these labours were over, and Stephen had secured a mouthful of breakfast in his brother's study, it was time to go down to prayers; and after prayers he had but just time to wonder what excuse he should make for only answering half his questions, when the clock pointed to the half-hour, and he had to scuttle off as hard as he could to the Doctor's study. Dr Senior was a tall, bald man, with small, sharp eyes, and with a face as solemn as an owl's.  He looked up as Stephen entered. ""Come in, my man.  Let me see; Greenfield?  Oh, yes.  You got here on Tuesday.  How old are you?"" ""Nearly eleven, sir,"" said Stephen, with the paper burning in his pocket. ""Just so; and I dare say your brother has shown you over the school, and helped to make you feel at home.  Now suppose we just run through what you have learned at home."" Now was the time.  With a sigh as deep as the pocket from which he pulled it, Stephen produced that miserable paper. ""I'm very sorry, sir,"" he began, ""I've not had time--"" ""Tut, tut!"" said the Doctor; ""put that away, and let us get on."" Stephen stared.  ""It's the paper you gave me!"" he said. The Doctor frowned.  ""I hope you are not a silly boy,"" he said, rather crossly. ""I'm afraid they are all wrong,"" said Stephen; ""the questions were-- were--rather hard."" ""What questions?"" exclaimed the Doctor, a trifle impatient, and a trifle puzzled. ""These you sent me,"" said Stephen, humbly handing in the paper. ""Hum! some mistake; let's see, perhaps Jellicott--ah!"" and he put on his glasses and unfolded the paper. ""Question 1.  Grammar!"" and then a cloud of amazement fell over the Doctor's face.  He looked sharply out from under his spectacles at Stephen, who stood anxiously and nervously before him.  Then he glanced again at the paper, and his mouth twitched now and then as he read the string of questions, and the boy's desperate attempts to answer them. ""Humph!"" he said, when the operation was over, ""I'm afraid, Greenfield, you are not a very clever boy--"" ""I know I'm not, sir,"" said Stephen, quite relieved that the Doctor did not at once order him to quit Saint Dominic's. ""Or you would have seen that this paper was a practical joke.""  Then it burst all of a sudden on Stephen.  And all this about ""Mr Finis"", ""Oh, ah,"" and the rest of it had been a cruel hoax, and no more! ""Come, now, let us waste no more time.  I'm not surprised,"" said the Doctor, suppressing a smile by a very hard twitch; ""I'm not surprised you found these questions hard.  How far have you got in arithmetic?"" And then the Doctor launched Stephen into a _viva voce_ examination, in which that young prodigy of learning acquitted himself far more favourably than could have been imagined, and at the end of which he heard that he would be placed in the fourth junior class, where it would be his duty to strain every nerve to advance, and make the best use of his time at Saint Dominic's.  Then the Doctor rang his bell. ""Tell Mr Rastle kindly to step here,"" said he to the porter. Mr Rastle appeared, and to his charge, after solemnly shaking hands and promising to be a paragon of industry and good conduct, Stephen was consigned by the head master. ""By the way,"" said the Doctor, as Stephen was leaving, ""will you tell the boy who gave you this paper I wish to see him?"" Stephen, who had been too much elated by the result of the real examination to recollect for the moment the trickery of the sham one, now blushed very red as he remembered what a goose he had been, and undertook to obey the Doctor's order.  And this it was very easy to do. For as he opened the study-door he saw Pembury just outside, leaning against the wall with his eyes on the clock as it struck ten. As he caught sight of Stephen emerging from the head master's study, his countenance fell, and he said eagerly and half-anxiously, ""Didn't I tell you ten o'clock, Greenfield?"" ""Yes, but the Doctor said half-past nine.  And you are a cad to make a fool of me,"" added Stephen, rising with indignation, ""and--and--and--"" and here he choked. ""Calm yourself, my young friend,"" said Pembury.  ""It's such a hard thing to make a fool of you that, you know, and--and--and--!"" ""I shall not speak to you,"" stammered Stephen. ""Oh, don't apologise,"" laughed Pembury.  ""Perhaps it would comfort you to kick me.  Please choose my right leg, as the other is off the ground, eh?"" ""The Doctor wants to speak to you, he says,"" said Stephen. Pembury's face fell again.  ""Do you mean to say he saw the paper, and you told him?"" he said, angrily. ""I showed him the paper, because I thought he had sent it; but I didn't tell him who gave it to me."" ""Then why does he want me?"" ""He wants the boy who gave me the paper, that's all he said,"" answered Stephen, walking off sulkily to his quarters, and leaving Anthony to receive the rebukes of Dr Senior, and make his apologies for his evil deeds as best he could. The offence after all was not a very terrible one, and Pembury got off with a mild reprimand on the evils of practical joking, at the end of which he found himself in his usual amiable frame of mind, and harbouring no malice against his innocent victim. ""Greenfield,"" said he, when shortly afterwards he met Oliver, ""I owe your young brother an apology."" ""What on earth for?"" ""I set him an examination paper to answer, which I'm afraid caused him some labour.  Never mind, it was all for the best."" ""What, did that paper he was groaning over come from you?  What a shame, Tony, to take advantage of a little beggar like him!"" ""I'm awfully sorry, tell him; but I say, Greenfield, it'll make a splendid paragraph for the _Dominican_.  By the way, are you going to let me have that poem you promised on the Guinea-pigs?"" ""I can't get on with it at all,"" said Oliver.  ""I'm stuck for a rhyme in the second line.""
