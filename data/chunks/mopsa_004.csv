"CHAPTER IV. BEES AND OTHER FELLOW-CREATURES.   The dove laid some little sticks,     Then began to coo;   The gnat took his trumpet up     To play the day through;   The pie chattered soft and long--     But that she always does;   The bee did all he had to do,     And only said, ""Buzz.""  When Jack at length opened his eyes, he found that it was night, for the full moon was shining; but it was not at all a dark night, for he could see distinctly some black birds, that looked like ravens. They were sitting in a row on the edge of the boat. Now that he had fairies in his pockets, he could understand bird-talk, and he heard one of these ravens saying, ""There is no meat so tender; I wish I could pick their little eyes out."" ""Yes,"" said another, ""fairies are delicate eating indeed. We must speak Jack fair if we want to get at them."" And she heaved up a deep sigh. Jack lay still, and thought he had better pretend to be asleep; but they soon noticed that his eyes were open, and one of them presently walked up his leg and bowed, and asked if he was hungry. Jack said, ""No."" ""No more am I,"" replied the raven; ""not at all hungry."" Then she hopped off his leg, and Jack sat up. ""And how are the sweet fairies that my young master is taking to their home?"" asked another of the ravens. ""I hope they are safe in my young master's pockets?"" Jack felt in his pockets. Yes, they were all safe; but he did not take any of them out, lest the ravens should snatch at them. ""Eh?"" continued the raven, pretending to listen; ""did this dear young gentleman say that the fairies were asleep?"" ""It doesn't amuse me to talk about fairies,"" said Jack; ""but if you would explain some of the things in this country that I cannot make out, I should be very glad."" ""What things?"" asked the blackest of the ravens. ""Why,"" said Jack, ""I see a full moon lying down there among the water-flags, and just going to set, and there is a half-moon overhead plunging among those great gray clouds, and just this moment I saw a thin crescent moon peeping out between the branches of that tree."" ""Well,"" said all the ravens at once, ""did the young master never see a crescent moon in the men and women's world?"" ""Oh yes,"" said Jack. ""Did he never see a full moon?"" asked the ravens. ""Yes, of course,"" said Jack; ""but they are the same moon. I could never see all three of them at the same time."" The ravens were very much surprised at this, and one of them said,-- ""If my young master did not see the moons it must have been because he didn't look. Perhaps my young master slept in a room, and had only one window; if so, he couldn't see all the sky at once."" ""I tell you, Raven,"" said Jack, laughing, ""that I KNOW there is never more than one moon in my country, and sometimes there is no moon at all!"" Upon this all the ravens hung down their heads, and looked very much ashamed; for there is nothing that birds hate so much as to be laughed at, and they believed that Jack was saying this to mock them, and that he knew what they had come for. So first one and then another hopped to the other end of the boat and flew away, till at last there was only one left, and she appeared to be out of spirits, and did not speak again till he spoke to her. ""Raven,"" said Jack, ""there's something very cold and slippery lying at the bottom of the boat. I touched it just now, and I don't like it at all."" ""It's a water-snake,"" said the raven; and she stooped and picked up a long thing with her beak, which she threw out, and then looked over. ""The water swarms with them, wicked, murderous creatures; they smell the young fairies, and they want to eat them."" Jack was so thrown off his guard that he snatched one fairy out, just to make sure that it was safe. It was the one with the mustache; and, alas! in one instant the raven flew at it, got it out of his hand, and pecked off its head before it had time to wake or Jack to rescue it. Then, as she slowly rose, she croaked, and said to Jack, ""You'll catch it for this, my young master!"" and she flew to the bough of a tree, where she finished eating the fairy, and threw his little empty coat into the river. On this Jack began to cry bitterly, and to think what a foolish boy he had been. He was the more sorry because he did not even know that poor little fellow's name. But he had heard the others calling by name to their companions, and very grand names they were too. One was Jovinian,--he was a very fierce-looking gentleman; the other two were Roxaletta and Mopsa. Presently, however, Jack forgot to be unhappy, for two of the moons went down, and then the sun rose, and he was delighted to find that however many moons there might be, there was only one sun, even in the country of the wonderful river. So on and on they went; but the river was very wide, and the waves were boisterous. On the right brink was a thick forest of trees, with such heavy foliage that a little way off they looked like a bank, green, and smooth, and steep; but as the light became clearer, Jack could see here and there the great stems, and see creatures like foxes, wild boars, and deer, come stealing down to drink in the river. It was very hot here; not at all like the spring weather he had left behind. And as the low sunbeams shone into Jack's face he said hastily, without thinking of what would occur, ""I wish I might land among those lovely glades on the left bank."" No sooner said than the boat began to make for the left bank, and the nearer they got towards it the more beautiful it became; but also the more stormy were the reaches of water they had to traverse. A lovely country indeed! It sloped gently down to the water's edge, and beautiful trees were scattered over it, soft, mossy grass grew everywhere, great old laburnum trees stretched their boughs down in patches over the water, and higher up camellias, almost as large as hawthorns, grew together and mingled their red and white flowers. The country was not so open as a park,--it was more like a half-cleared woodland; but there was a wide space just where the boat was steering for, that had no trees, only a few flowering shrubs. Here groups of strange-looking people were bustling about, and there were shrill fifes sounding, and drums. Farther back he saw rows of booths or tents under the shade of the trees. In another place some people dressed like gypsies had made fires of sticks just at the skirts of the woodland, and were boiling their pots. Some of these had very gaudy tilted carts, hung all over with goods, such as baskets, brushes, mats, little glasses, pottery, and beads.

"It seemed to be a kind of fair, to which people had gathered from all parts; but there was not one house to be seen. All the goods were either hung upon trees or collected in strange-looking tents. The people were not all of the same race; indeed, he thought the only human beings were the gypsies, for the folks who had tents were no taller than himself. How hot it was that morning! and as the boat pushed itself into a little creek, and made its way among the beds of yellow and purple iris which skirted the brink, what a crowd of dragon-flies and large butterflies rose from them! ""Stay where you are!"" cried Jack to the boat; and at that instant such a splendid moth rose slowly, that he sprang on shore after it, and quite forgot the fair and the people in his desire to follow it. The moth settled on a great red honey-flower, and he stole up to look at it. As large as a swallow, it floated on before him. Its wings were nearly black, and they had spots of gold on them. When it rose again Jack ran after it, till he found himself close to the rows of tents where the brown people stood; and they began to cry out to him, ""What'll you buy? what'll you buy, sir?"" and they crowded about him, so that he soon lost sight of the moth, and forgot everything else in his surprise at the booths. They were full of splendid things,--clocks and musical boxes, strange china ornaments, embroidered slippers, red caps, and many kinds of splendid silks and small carpets. In other booths were swords and dirks, glittering with jewels; and the chatter of the people when they talked together was not in a language that Jack could understand. Some of the booths were square, and evidently made of common canvas, for when you went into them, and the sun shone, you could distinctly see the threads. But scattered a little farther on in groups were some round tents, which were far more curious. They were open on all sides, and consisted only of a thick canopy overhead, which was supported by one beautiful round pillar in the middle. Outside the canopy was white or brownish; but when Jack stood under these tents, he saw that they were lined with splendid flutings of brown or pink silk: what looked like silk, at least, for it was impossible to be sure whether these were real tents or gigantic mushrooms. They varied in size, also, as mushrooms do, and in shape: some were large enough for twenty people to stand under them, and had flat tops with a brown lining; others had dome-shaped roofs; these were lined with pink, and would only shelter six or seven. The people who sold in these tents were as strange as their neighbors; each had a little high cap on his head, in shape just like a beehive, and it was made of straw, and had a little hole in front. In fact, Jack very soon saw bees flying in and out, and it was evident that these people had their honey made on the premises. They were chiefly selling country produce. They had cheeses so large as to reach to their waists, and the women trundled them along as boys do their hoops. They sold a great many kinds of seed, too, in wooden bowls, and cakes and good things to eat, such as gilt gingerbread. Jack bought some of this, and found it very nice indeed. But when he took out his money to pay for it, the little man looked rather strangely at it, and turned it over with an air of disgust. Then Jack saw him hand it to his wife, who also seemed to dislike it; and presently Jack observed that they followed him about, first on one side, then on the other. At last, the little woman slipped her hand into his pocket, and Jack, putting his hand in directly, found his sixpence had been returned. ""Why, you've given me back my money!"" he said. The little woman put her hands behind her. ""I do not like it,"" she said; ""it's dirty; at least, it's not new."" ""No, it's not new,"" said Jack, a good deal surprised, ""but it is a good sixpence."" ""The bees don't like it,"" continued the little woman. ""They like things to be neat and new, and that sixpence is bent."" ""What shall I give you then?"" said Jack. The good little woman laughed and blushed. ""This young gentleman has a beautiful whistle round his neck,"" she observed, politely, but did not ask for it. Jack had a dog-whistle, so he took it off and gave it to her. ""Thank you for the bees,"" she said. ""They love to be called home when we've collected flowers for them."" So she made a pretty little courtesy, and went away to her customers. There were some very strange creatures also, about the same height as Jack, who had no tents, and seemed there to buy, not to sell. Yet they looked poorer than the other folks, and they were also very cross and discontented; nothing pleased them. Their clothes were made of moss, and their mantles of feathers; and they talked in a queer whistling tone of voice, and carried their skinny little children on their backs and on their shoulders. They were treated with great respect by the people in the tents; and when Jack asked his friend to whom he had given the whistle what they were, and where they got so much money as they had, she replied that they lived over the hills, and were afraid to come in their best clothes. They were rich and powerful at home, and they came shabbily dressed, and behaved humbly, lest their enemies should envy them. It was very dangerous, she said, to fairies to be envied. Jack wanted to listen to their strange whistling talk, but he could not for the noise and cheerful chattering of the brown folks, and more still for the screaming and talking of parrots. Among the goods were hundreds of splendid gilt cages, which were hung by long gold chains from the trees. Each cage contained a parrot and his mate, and they all seemed to be very unhappy indeed. The parrots could talk, and they kept screaming to the discontented women to buy things for them, and trying very hard to attract attention. One old parrot made himself quite conspicuous by these efforts. He flung himself against the wires of his cage, he squalled, he screamed, he knocked the floor with his beak, till Jack and one of the customers came running up to see what was the matter.
