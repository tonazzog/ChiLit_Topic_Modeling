"CHAPTER 12. IN THE CHAPEL. The bright light from a full noontide sun was shining in coloured bars through the richly-painted windows of the little chapel when Mrs Willis sought Cecil Temple there. Cecil's face was in many ways a remarkable one.  Her soft brown eyes were generally filled with a steadfast and kindly ray.  Gentleness was her special prerogative, but there was nothing weak about her--hers was the gentleness of a strong and pure and noble soul.  To know Cecil was to love her.  She was a motherless girl, and the only child of a most indulgent father.  Colonel Temple was now in India, and Cecil was to finish her education under Mrs Willis's care, and then, if necessary, to join her father. Mrs Willis had always taken a special interest in this girl.  She admired her for her great moral worth.  Cecil was not particularly clever, but she was so studious, so painstaking, that she always kept a high place in class.  She was without doubt a religious girl, but there was nothing of the prig about her.  She was not, however, ashamed of her religion, and, if the fitting occasion arose, she was fearless in expressing her opinion. Mrs Willis used to call Cecil her ""little standard-bearer,"" and she relied greatly on her influence over the third-class girls.  Mrs Willis considered the third-class, perhaps, the most important in the school. She was often heard to say-- ""The girls who fill this class have come to a turning-point--they have come to the age when resolves may be made for life, and kept.  The good third-class girl is very unlikely to degenerate as she passes through the second and first classes.  On the other hand, there is very little hope that the idle or mischievous third-class girl will mend her ways as she goes higher in the school."" Mrs Willis's steps were very slow, and her thoughts extremely painful, as she entered the chapel to-day.  Had any one else offered her defiance she would have known how to deal with the culprit, but Cecil would never have acted as she did without the strongest motive, and Mrs Willis felt more sorrowful than angry as she sat down by the side of her favourite pupil. ""I have kept you waiting longer than I intended, my dear,"" she said.  ""I was unexpectedly interrupted, and I am sorry; but you have had more time to think, Cecil."" ""Yes, I have thought,"" answered Cecil, in a very low tone. ""And, perhaps,"" continued her governess, ""in this quiet and beautiful and sacred place, my dear pupil has also prayed?"" ""I have prayed,"" said Cecil. ""Then you have been guided, Cecil,"" said Mrs Willis in a tone of relief.  ""We do not come to God in our distress without being shown the right way.  Your doubts have been removed, Cecil; you can now speak fully to me; can you not, dear?"" ""I have asked God to tell me what is right,"" said Cecil.  ""I don't pretend to know.  I am very much puzzled.  It seems to me that more good would be done if I concealed what you asked me to confess in the school-room.  My own feeling is that I ought not to tell you.  I know this is great disobedience, and I am quite willing to receive any punishment you think right to give me.  Yes, I think I am quite willing to receive _any_ punishment."" Mrs Willis put her hand on Cecil's shoulder. ""Ordinary punishments are not likely to affect you, Cecil,"" she said; ""on you I have no idea of inflicting extra lessons, or depriving you of half-holidays, or even taking away your drawing-room.  But there is something else you must lose, and that I know will touch you deeply--I must remove from you my confidence."" Cecil's face grew very pale. ""And your love, too?"" she said, looking up with imploring eyes: ""oh, surely not your love as well?"" ""I ask you frankly, Cecil,"" replied Mrs Willis, ""can perfect love exist without perfect confidence?  I would not willingly deprive you of my love, but of necessity the love I have hitherto felt for you must be altered--in short, the old love which enabled me to rest on you and trust you, will cease."" Cecil covered her face with her hands. ""This punishment is very cruel,"" she said.  ""You are right; it reaches down to my very heart.  But,"" she added, looking up with a strong and sweet light in her face, ""I will try and bear it, and some day you will understand."" ""Listen, Cecil,"" said Mrs Willis, ""you have just told me you have prayed to God, and have asked Him to show you the right path.  Now, my dear, suppose we kneel together, and both of us ask Him to show us the way out of this difficult matter.  I want to be guided to use the right words with you, Cecil.  You want to be guided to receive the instruction which I, as your teacher and mother-friend, would give you."" Cecil and Mrs Willis both knelt down, and the head-mistress said a few words in a voice of great earnestness and entreaty; then they resumed their seats. ""Now, Cecil,"" said Mrs Willis, ""you must remember in listening to me that I am speaking to you as I believe God wishes me to.  If I can convince you that you are doing wrong in concealing what you know from me, will you act as I wish in the matter?"" ""I long to be convinced,"" said Cecil, in a low tone. ""That is right, my dear; I can now speak to you with perfect freedom. My words you will remember, Cecil, are now, I firmly believe, directed by God; they are also the result of a large experience.  I have trained many girls.  I have watched the phases of thought in many young minds. Cecil, look at me.  I can read you like a book."" Cecil looked up expectantly. ""Your motive for this concealment is as clear as the daylight, Cecil. You are keeping back what you know because you want to shield some one. Am I not right, my dear?""  The colour flooded Cecil's pale face.  She bent her head in silent assent, but her eyes were too full of tears, and her lips trembled too much to allow her to speak. ""The girl you want to defend,"" continued Mrs Willis, in that clear patient voice of hers, ""is one whom you and I both love; is one for whom we both have prayed; is one for whom we would both gladly sacrifice ourselves if necessary--her name is--"" ""Oh, don't,"" said Cecil imploringly--""don't say her name; you have no right to suspect her."" ""I must say her name, Cecil dear.  If you suspect Annie Forest, why should not I?  You do suspect her, do you not, Cecil?"" Cecil began to cry. ""I know it,"" continued Mrs Willis.  ""Now, Cecil, we will suppose, terrible as this suspicion is, fearfully as it pains us both, that Annie Forest _is_ guilty.  We must suppose for the sake of my argument that this is the case.  Do you not know, my dear Cecil, that you are doing the falsest, cruellest thing by dear Annie in trying to hide her sin from me?  Suppose, just for the sake of our argument, that this cowardly conduct on Annie's part was never found out by me; what effect would it have on Annie herself?""
