"CHAPTER 4. A HUNGRY DAY. ""We shall see what father does,"" was still the consolation with which Oliver kept down his sister's fears.  He had such confidence in his father's knowing what was best to be done on all occasions, that he felt they had only to watch him, and imitate whatever he might attempt.  They remained quiet on the island now, hungry and tired as they were, because he remained in the mill, and seemed to expect the water to subside.  The most fearful thought was what they were to do after dark, if they should not get home before that.  They supposed, at last, that their father was thinking of this too; for he began to move about, when the sun was near setting, more than he had done all the afternoon. They saw him go carefully down into the stream, and proceed cautiously for some way--till the water was up to his chin.  Then he was buffeted about so terribly that Mildred could not bear to look.  Both Oliver and Roger were sure, by what he ventured, and by the way he pulled himself back at last to the steps, that he had tied himself by the rope they had seen him measure.  It was certainly too short for any good purpose; for he had to go back, having only wetted himself to the skin.  They saw this by the yellow light from the west which shone upon the water.  In a few minutes they could distinguish him no longer, though the mill stood up black against the sky, and in the midst of the gleaming flood. ""Father will be wet, and so cold all night!"" said Mildred, crying. ""If I could only swim,"" exclaimed Oliver, ""I would get over to him somehow, and carry a rope from the house.  I am sure there must be a rope long enough somewhere about the yard.  If I could only swim, I would get to him."" ""That you wouldn't,"" said Roger.  ""Your father can swim; and why does not he?  Because nobody could swim across that stream.  It is a torrent. It would carry any stout man out over the carr; and you would be no better than a twig in the middle of it."" ""I am afraid now this torrent will not slacken,"" said Oliver, thoughtfully.  ""I am afraid there is some hollow near which will keep up the current."" ""What do you mean by that?"" ""They say in Holland, where they have floods sometimes, that when water flows into a hollow, it gets out in a current, and keeps it up for some way.  Oh!  The quarry!"" he cried, with sudden recollection.  ""Mildred, let us go, and look what is doing on that side before it is dark."" They ran round the hill; and there they saw indeed that the flood was tumbling in the quarry, like water boiling in a pot.  When it rushed out, it carried white earth with it, which made a long streak in the flood, and explained how it was that the stream between the house and the mill was whiter and more muddy than that between their hill and the house.  At once it occurred to Roger that the stream between the hill and the house was probably less rapid than the other; and he said so. Oliver ran back; and so did Mildred, pleased at the bare idea of getting to the house. Once more arrived opposite the house, they saw a strange sight.  The mill no longer stood in its right place.  It had moved a good way down towards the carr.  Not only that, but it was still moving.  It was sailing away like a ship.  After the first exclamation, even Roger stood as still as death to watch it.  He neither moved nor spoke till the mill was out of sight in the dusk.  When Mildred burst into a loud cry, and Oliver threw himself down, hiding his face on the ground, Roger spoke again. ""Be quiet--you must,"" he said, decidedly, to the little girl.  ""We must bestir ourselves now, instead of stopping to see what other folks will do."" ""Oh, father!  Father will be drowned!"" cried they. ""You don't know that.  If he drifts out to the Humber, which is likely, by the way he is going, some ship may pick him up--or he may light upon some high ground.  We can't settle that now, however; and the clear thing is that he wouldn't wish us to starve, whether he drowns or not. Come, get up, lad!"" said he, stirring Oliver with his foot. ""Don't lie there, Oliver; do get up!"" begged Mildred. Oliver rose, and did all that Roger bade him. ""You say there is a long rope somewhere about the house,"" said Roger. ""Where is it?"" ""There is one in the cow-shed, I know."" ""And if I cannot get there, is there one in the house?"" ""In the lumber-room,"" said Mildred.  ""The spare bed is tied round and round with a long rope--I don't know how long."" ""I wish we had set about it an hour ago,"" muttered Roger, ""instead of waiting for dark.  A pretty set of fools we have been to lose the daylight!  I say, lad, can you think of anyway of making a fire?  Here are sticks enough, if one could set them alight."" ""To cook a supper?"" asked Mildred. ""No; I mean to sup within doors; only we must do some work first."" Oliver had a steel knife; but it was too dark to look for a flint, if any other plan than a fire would do. ""Well, don't plague any more about a fire,"" said Roger, ""but listen to me.  Can you climb a tree?  I'll be bound you can't: and now you'll die if you can't."" ""I can,"" said Oliver; ""but what is Mildred to do?"" ""We'll see that afterwards.  Which of these trees stands nearest to the nearest of yon upper windows?"" Oliver and Mildred pointed out a young ash, which now quite bent over the water. ""That is not strong enough,"" said Roger, shaking the tree, and finding it loosened at the roots.  ""Show me a stouter one."" A well-grown beech was the next nearest.  Roger pulled Oliver by the arm, and made him stand directly under the tree, with his sister beside him.  He desired them not to move from where they were, and to give a loud halloo together, or a shriek (or anything that might be heard furthest)--about once in a minute for an hour to come, unless they should hear a rope fall into the tree, or anywhere near them.  They were to watch for this rope, and use all their endeavours to catch it.  There would be a weight at the end, which would make it easier to catch. Oliver must tie this rope to the trunk of the tree, stretching it tight, with all his strength, and then tying it so securely that no weight would unfasten it. ""Mind you that,"" said Roger.  ""If you don't, you will be drowned, that's all.  Do as I tell you, and you'll see what you will see."" Roger then whistled for his dog, snatched Oliver's black ribbon from about his neck, and fastened it round the dog's neck, to hold by.  He then showed the dog the house, and forced him into the water, himself following, till the children could no longer see what became of them. ""What do you think he means?"" asked poor Mildred, shivering. ""I don't know exactly.  He cannot mean that we are to climb over by a rope.  I do not think I could do that; and I am sure you could not."" ""Oh, no, no!  Let us stay here!  Stay with me under the trees, here, Oliver."" ""Why, it would be much more comfortable to be at home by the fire.  You are shivering now, already, as if it was winter: and the night will be very long, with nothing to eat."" ""But Roger is gone; and I don't like to be where he is,--he is such a rude boy!  How he snatched your ribbon, and pulled you about!  And he calls you `lad,' when he might just as well say `Oliver.'"" ""We must not mind such things now, dear.  And we must get home, if he can show us how.  Think how glad Ailwin and George will be: and I am sure father would wish it, and mother too.  You must not cry now, Mildred; indeed you must not.  People must do what they can at such a time as this.  Come, help me to shout.  Shriek as loud and as long as ever you can."" ""I wish I might say my prayers,"" said Mildred, presently. ""Do, dear.  Kneel down here;--nobody sees us.  Let us ask God to save father,--and us too, and George and Ailwin, if it pleases Him;--and Roger.""

"They kneeled down, and Oliver said aloud to God what was in his heart. It was a great comfort to them both; for they knew that while no human eye saw them in the starlight, under the tree, God heard their words, and understood their hearts. ""Now again!"" said Oliver, as they stood up. They raised a cry about once a minute, as nearly as they could guess: and they had given as many as thirty shouts, and began to find it very hard work, before anything happened to show them that it was of any use. Then something struck the tree over their heads, and pattered down among the leaves, touching Oliver's head at last.  He felt about, and caught the end of a rope, without having to climb the tree, to search for it.  They set up a shout of a different kind now; for they really were very glad.  This shout was answered by a gentle tug at the rope: but Oliver held fast, determined not to let anything pull the precious line out of his hand. ""What have we here?"" said he, as he felt a parcel tied to the rope, a little way from the end.  He gave it to Mildred to untie and open; which she did with some trouble, wishing the evening was not so dark. It was a tinder-box. ""There now!"" said Oliver, ""we shall soon know what we are about.  Do you know where the tree was cut down, the other day?"" ""Close by?  Yes."" ""Well; bring a lapful of chips,--quick; and then any dry sticks you can find.  We can get on twice as fast with a light; and then they will see from the house how we manage."" In a few minutes, there was a fire blazing near the tree.  The rope must have come straight over from the house, without dipping once into the water; for not only were the flint and steel safe, but the tinder within, and the cloth that the box was done up in, were quite dry. ""Roger is a clever fellow,--that is certain,"" said Oliver.  ""Now for fastening the rope.  Do you take care that the fire keeps up.  Don't spare for chips.  Keep a good fire till I have done."" Oliver gave all his strength to pulling the rope tight, and winding it round the trunk of the beech, just above a large knob in the stem.  It seemed to him that the rope stretched pretty evenly, as far as he could see,--not slanting either up or down; so that the sill of the upper window must be about upon a level with the great knob in the beech-trunk.  Oliver tied knot upon knot, till no more rope was left to knot.  It still hung too slack, if it was meant for a bridge.  He did not think he could ever cross the water on a rope that would keep him dangling at every move: but he had pulled it tight with all his force, and he could do no more.  When he had tied the last knot, he and Mildred stood in front of the fire, and raised one more great shout, waving their arms--sure now of being seen as well as heard. ""Look!  Look!"" cried Oliver, ""it is moving;--the rope is not so slack! They are tightening it.  How much tighter it is than I could pull it! That must be Ailwin's strong arm,--together with Roger's."" ""But still I never can creep across that way,"" declared Mildred.  ""I wish you would not try.  Oliver.  Do stay with me!"" ""I will not leave you, dear: but we do not know what they mean us to do yet.  There!  Now the rope is shaking!  We shall see something.  Do you see anything coming?  Don't look at the flashing water.  Fix your eye on the rope, with the light upon it.  What do you see?"" ""I see something like a basket,--like one of our clothes' baskets,-- coming along the line."" It was one of Mrs Linacre's clothes' baskets, which was slung upon the rope; and Roger was in it.  He did not stay a minute.  He threw to Oliver a line which was fastened to the end of the basket, with which he might pull it over, from the window to the tree, when emptied of Roger. He was then to put Mildred into the basket, carefully keeping hold of the line, in order to pull it back for himself when his sister should be safely landed.  Ailwin held a line fastened to the other end of the basket, with which to pull it the other way. Oliver was overjoyed.  He said he had never seen anything so clever; and he asked Mildred whether she could possibly be afraid of riding over in this safe little carriage.  He told her how to help her passage by pulling herself along the bridge-rope, as he called it, instead of hindering her progress by clinging to the rope as she sat in the basket. Taking care not to let go the line for a moment, he again examined the knots of the longer rope, and found they were all fast.  In a few minutes he began hauling in his line, and the empty basket came over very easily. ""How shall I get in?"" asked Mildred, trembling. ""Here,"" said Oliver, stooping his back to her.  ""Climb upon my back. Now hold by the tree, and stand upon my shoulders.  Don't be afraid. You are light enough.  Now, can't you step in?"" Feeling how much depended upon this, the little girl managed it.  She tumbled into the basket, took a lesson from Oliver how to help her own passage, and earnestly begged him to take care of his line, that nothing might prevent his following her immediately.  Then came a great tug, and she felt herself drawn back into the darkness.  She did not like it at all.  The water roared louder than ever as she hung over it; and the light which was cast upon it from the fire showed how rapidly it was shooting beneath.  Then she saw Oliver go, and throw some more chips and twigs on the fire; and she knew by that that he could see her no longer. She worked as hard as she could, putting her hands one behind the other along the rope: but her hands were weak, and her head was very dizzy. She had had nothing to eat since breakfast, and was quite tired out. While still keeping her eyes upon Oliver, she felt a jerk.  The basket knocked against something; and it made her quite sick.  She immediately heard Ailwin's voice saying, ""'tis one of them, that's certain.  Well! If I didn't think it was some vile conjuring trick, up to this very moment!"" The poor dizzy child felt a strong arm passed round her waist, and found herself carried near a fire in a room.  She faltered out, ""Ailwin, get something for Oliver to eat.  He will be here presently."" ""That I will: and for you first.  You shall both have a drop of my cherry-brandy too."" Mildred said she had rather have a draught of milk; but Ailwin said there was no milk.  She had not been able to reach the cow, to milk her. What had poor little George done, then?--He had had some that had been left from the morning.  Ailwin added that she was very sorry,--she could not tell how she came to be so forgetful; but she had never thought of not being able to milk the cow in the afternoon, and had drunk up all that George left of the milk; her regular dinner having been drowned in the kitchen.  Neither had she remembered to bring anything eatable up-stairs with her when the flood drove her from the lower rooms.  The flour and grain were now all under water.  The vegetables were, no doubt, swimming about in the cellar; and the meat would have been where the flour was, at this moment, if Roger, who said he had no mind to be starved, had not somehow fished up a joint of mutton.  This was now stewing over the fire; but it was little likely to be good; for besides there being no vegetables, the salt was all melted, and the water was none of the best.  Indeed, the water was so bad that it could not be drunk alone: and again good Ailwin pressed a drop of her cherry-brandy. Mildred, however, preferred a cup of the broth, which, poor as it was, was all the better for the loaf--the only loaf of bread--being boiled in it.
