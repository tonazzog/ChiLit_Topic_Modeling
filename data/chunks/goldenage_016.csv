"CHAPTER 15. THE BLUE ROOM That nature has her moments of sympathy with man has been noted often enough,--and generally as a new discovery; to us, who had never known any other condition of things, it seemed entirely right and fitting that the wind sang and sobbed in the poplar tops, and in the lulls of it, sudden spirts of rain spattered the already dusty roads, on that blusterous March day when Edward and I awaited, on the station platform, the arrival of the new tutor. Needless to say, this arrangement had been planned by an aunt, from some fond idea that our shy, innocent young natures would unfold themselves during the walk from the station, and that on the revelation of each other’s more solid qualities that must then inevitably ensue, an enduring friendship springing from mutual respect might be firmly based. A pretty dream,--nothing more. For Edward, who foresaw that the brunt of tutorial oppression would have to be borne by him, was sulky, monosyllabic, and determined to be as negatively disagreeable as good manners would permit. It was therefore evident that I would have to be spokesman and purveyor of hollow civilities, and I was none the more amiable on that account; all courtesies, welcomes, explanations, and other court-chamberlain kind of business, being my special aversion. There was much of the tempestuous March weather in the hearts of both of us, as we sullenly glowered along the carriage-windows of the slackening train. One is apt, however, to misjudge the special difficulties of a situation; and the reception proved, after all, an easy and informal matter. In a trainful so uniformly bucolic, a tutor was readily recognisable; and his portmanteau had been consigned to the luggage-cart, and his person conveyed into the lane, before I had discharged one of my carefully considered sentences. I breathed more easily, and, looking up at our new friend as we stepped out together, remembered that we had been counting on something altogether more arid, scholastic, and severe. A boyish eager face and a petulant pince-nez,--untidy hair,--a head of constant quick turns like a robin’s, and a voice that kept breaking into alto,--these were all very strange and new, but not in the least terrible. He proceeded jerkily through the village, with glances on this side and that; and “Charming,” he broke out presently; “quite too charming and delightful!” I had not counted on this sort of thing, and glanced for help to Edward, who, hands in pockets, looked grimly down his nose. He had taken his line, and meant to stick to it. Meantime our friend had made an imaginary spy-glass out of his fist, and was squinting through it at something I could not perceive. “What an exquisite bit!” he burst out; “fifteenth century,--no,--yes, it is!” I began to feel puzzled, not to say alarmed. It reminded me of the butcher in the Arabian Nights, whose common joints, displayed on the shop-front, took to a startled public the appearance of dismembered humanity. This man seemed to see the strangest things in our dull, familiar surroundings. “Ah!” he broke out again, as we jogged on between hedgerows: “and that field now--backed by the downs--with the rain-cloud brooding over it,--that’s all David Cox--every bit of it!” “That field belongs to Farmer Larkin,” I explained politely, for of course he could not be expected to know. “I’ll take you over to Farmer Cox’s to-morrow, if he’s a friend of yours; but there’s nothing to see there.” Edward, who was hanging sullenly behind, made a face at me, as if to say, “What sort of lunatic have we got here?” “It has the true pastoral character, this country of yours,” went on our enthusiast: “with just that added touch in cottage and farmstead, relics of a bygone art, which makes our English landscape so divine, so unique!” Really this grasshopper was becoming a burden. These familiar fields and farms, of which we knew every blade and stick, had done nothing that I knew of to be bespattered with adjectives in this way. I had never thought of them as divine, unique, or anything else. They were--well, they were just themselves, and there was an end of it. Despairingly I jogged Edward in the ribs, as a sign to start rational conversation, but he only grinned and continued obdurate. “You can see the house now,” I remarked, presently; “and that’s Selina, chasing the donkey in the paddock,--or is it the donkey chasing Selina? I can’t quite make out; but it’s THEM, anyhow.” Needless to say, he exploded with a full charge of adjectives. “Exquisite!” he rapped out; “so mellow and harmonious! and so entirely in keeping!” (I could see from Edward’s face that he was thinking who ought to be in keeping.) “Such possibilities of romance, now, in those old gables!” “If you mean the garrets,” I said, “there’s a lot of old furniture in them; and one is generally full of apples; and the bats get in sometimes, under the eaves, and flop about till we go up with hair-brushes and things and drive ‘em out; but there’s nothing else in them that I know of.” “Oh, but there must be more than bats,” he cried. “Don’t tell me there are no ghosts. I shall be deeply disappointed if there aren’t any ghosts.” I did not think it worth while to reply, feeling really unequal to this sort of conversation; besides, we were nearing the house, when my task would be ended. Aunt Eliza met us at the door, and in the cross-fire of adjectives that ensued--both of them talking at once, as grown-up folk have a habit of doing--we two slipped round to the back of the house, and speedily put several solid acres between us and civilisation, for fear of being ordered in to tea in the drawing-room. By the time we returned, our new importation had gone up to dress for dinner, so till the morrow at least we were free of him. Meanwhile the March wind, after dropping a while at sundown, had been steadily increasing in volume; and although I fell asleep at my usual hour, about midnight I was wakened by the stress and cry of it. In the bright moonlight, wind-swung branches tossed and swayed eerily across the blinds; there was rumbling in chimneys, whistling in keyholes, and everywhere a clamour and a call. Sleep was out of the question, and, sitting up in bed, I looked round. Edward sat up too. “I was wondering when you were going to wake,” he said. “It’s no good trying to sleep through this. I vote we get up and do something.” “I’m game,” I replied. “Let’s play at being in a ship at sea” (the plaint of the old house under the buffeting wind suggested this, naturally); “and we can be wrecked on an island, or left on a raft, whichever you choose; but I like an island best myself, because there’s more things on it.” ",blue room nature moment sympathy man note new discovery other condition thing seem right fitting wind sing sobb poplar top lull sudden spirt rain spatter dusty road blusterous day await station platform arrival new tutor needless arrangement plan aunt fond idea shy innocent young nature unfold walk station revelation other solid quality ensue endure friendship spring mutual respect base pretty dream more foresee brunt tutorial oppression borne sulky monosyllabic determined disagreeable manners permit evident spokesman purveyor hollow civility amiable account courtesy welcome explanation other court chamberlain kind business special aversion much tempestuous weather heart glower carriage window slacken train apt misjudge special difficulty situation reception prove easy informal matter trainful bucolic tutor recognisable portmanteau consign luggage cart person convey lane discharge consider sentence breathe new friend step remember count arid scholastic severe boyish eager face petulant pince nez untidy hair head constant quick turn robin voice keep break strange new least terrible proceed village glance side charming break charming delightful count sort thing glance help hand pocket nose line mean stick friend imaginary spy glass fist squint perceive exquisite bit burst fifteenth century begin feel puzzled alarmed remind butcher arabian common joint display shop front startle public appearance dismember humanity man seem strangest thing dull familiar surroundings break jogge hedgerow field back down rain cloud brooding bit field belong explain course expect friend hang face sort lunatic true pastoral character country enthusiast add touch cottage farmstead relic bygone art english landscape divine unique grasshopper become burden familiar field farm blade stick bespatter adjective way divine unique else end jogge rib sign start rational conversation grin continue obdurate house remark chase donkey paddock donkey chase needless explode full charge adjective exquisite rapp mellow harmonious keep face keep such possibility romance old gable mean garret lot old furniture full apple bat eave flop hair brush thing drive else more bat cry ghost disappointed ghost worth while reply feel unequal sort conversation near house task end meet door cross fire adjective ensue talk grow folk habit slip back house put several solid acre civilisation fear order tea draw room time return new importation dress dinner morrow least free wind drop while sundown increase volume fall asleep usual hour midnight waken stress cry bright moonlight wind swing branch toss sway blind rumbling chimney whistle keyhole clamour call sleep question sit bed sit wonder wake try sleep vote game reply let play ship sea plaint old house buffeting wind suggest wreck island leave raft choose like island more thing 
"Edward on reflection negatived the idea. “It would make too much noise,”  he pointed out. “There’s no fun playing at ships, unless you can make a jolly good row.” The door creaked, and a small figure in white slipped cautiously in. “Thought I heard you talking,” said Charlotte. “We don’t like it; we’re afraid--Selina too. She’ll be here in a minute. She’s putting on her new dressing-gown she’s so proud of.” His arms round his knees, Edward cogitated deeply until Selina appeared, barefooted, and looking slim and tall in the new dressing-gown. Then, “Look here,” he exclaimed; “now we’re all together, I vote we go and explore!” “You’re always wanting to explore,” I said. “What on earth is there to explore for in this house?” “Biscuits!” said the inspired Edward. “Hooray! Come on!” chimed in Harold, sitting up suddenly. He had been awake all the time, but had been shamming asleep, lest he should be fagged to do anything. It was indeed a fact, as Edward had remembered, that our thoughtless elders occasionally left the biscuits out, a prize for the night-walking adventurer with nerves of steel. Edward tumbled out of bed, and pulled a baggy old pair of knickerbockers over his bare shanks. Then he girt himself with a belt, into which he thrust, on the one side a large wooden pistol, on the other an old single-stick; and finally he donned a big slouch-hat--once an uncle’s--that we used for playing Guy Fawkes and Charles-the-Second up-a-tree in. Whatever the audience, Edward, if possible, always dressed for his parts with care and conscientiousness; while Harold and I, true Elizabethans, cared little about the mounting of the piece, so long as the real dramatic heart of it beat sound. Our commander now enjoined on us a silence deep as the grave, reminding us that Aunt Eliza usually slept with an open door, past which we had to file. “But we’ll take the short cut through the Blue Room,” said the wary Selina. “Of course,” said Edward, approvingly. “I forgot about that. Now then! You lead the way!” The Blue Room had in prehistoric times been added to by taking in a superfluous passage, and so not only had the advantage of two doors, but enabled us to get to the head of the stairs without passing the chamber wherein our dragon-aunt lay couched. It was rarely occupied, except when a casual uncle came down for the night. We entered in noiseless file, the room being plunged in darkness, except for a bright strip of moonlight on the floor, across which we must pass for our exit. On this our leading lady chose to pause, seizing the opportunity to study the hang of her new dressing-gown. Greatly satisfied thereat, she proceeded, after the feminine fashion, to peacock and to pose, pacing a minuet down the moonlit patch with an imaginary partner. This was too much for Edward’s histrionic instincts, and after a moment’s pause he drew his single-stick, and with flourishes meet for the occasion, strode onto the stage. A struggle ensued on approved lines, at the end of which Selina was stabbed slowly and with unction, and her corpse borne from the chamber by the ruthless cavalier. The rest of us rushed after in a clump, with capers and gesticulations of delight; the special charm of the performance lying in the necessity for its being carried out with the dumbest of dumb shows. Once out on the dark landing, the noise of the storm without told us that we had exaggerated the necessity for silence; so, grasping the tails of each other’s nightgowns even as Alpine climbers rope themselves together in perilous places, we fared stoutly down the staircase-moraine, and across the grim glacier of the hall, to where a faint glimmer from the half-open door of the drawing-room beckoned to us like friendly hostel-lights. Entering, we found that our thriftless seniors had left the sound red heart of a fire, easily coaxed into a cheerful blaze; and biscuits--a plateful--smiled at us in an encouraging sort of way, together with the halves of a lemon, already once squeezed but still suckable. The biscuits were righteously shared, the lemon segments passed from mouth to mouth; and as we squatted round the fire, its genial warmth consoling our unclad limbs, we realised that so many nocturnal perils had not been braved in vain. “It’s a funny thing,” said Edward, as we chatted, “how; I hate this room in the daytime. It always means having your face washed, and your hair brushed, and talking silly company talk. But to-night it’s really quite jolly. Looks different, somehow.” “I never can make out,” I said, “what people come here to tea for. They can have their own tea at home if they like,--they’re not poor people,--with jam and things, and drink out of their saucer, and suck their fingers and enjoy themselves; but they come here from a long way off, and sit up straight with their feet off the bars of their chairs, and have one cup, and talk the same sort of stuff every time.” Selina sniffed disdainfully. “You don’t know anything about it,” she said. “In society you have to call on each other. It’s the proper thing to do.” “Pooh! YOU’RE not in society,” said Edward, politely; “and, what’s more, you never will be.” “Yes, I shall, some day,” retorted Selina; “but I shan’t ask you to come and see me, so there!” “Wouldn’t come if you did,” growled Edward. “Well, you won’t get the chance,” rejoined our sister, claiming her right of the last word. There was no heat about these little amenities, which made up--as we understood it--the art of polite conversation. “I don ‘t like society people,” put in Harold from the sofa, where he was sprawling at full length,--a sight the daylight hours would have blushed to witness. “There were some of ‘em here this afternoon, when you two had gone off to the station. Oh, and I found a dead mouse on the lawn, and I wanted to skin it, but I wasn’t sure I knew how, by myself; and they came out into the garden and patted my head,--I wish people wouldn’t do that,--and one of ‘em asked me to pick her a flower. Don’t know why she couldn’t pick it herself; but I said, ‘All right, I will if you’ll hold my mouse.’ But she screamed, and threw it away; and Augustus (the cat) got it, and ran away with it. I believe it was really his mouse all the time, ‘cos he’d been looking about as if he had lost something, so I wasn’t angry with HIM; but what did SHE want to throw away my mouse for?” ",reflection negative idea much noise point fun play ship jolly row door creak small figure white slip hear talk like afraid minute put new dress gown proud arm knee cogitate appear barefoot slim tall new dress gown exclaim vote explore want explore earth explore house biscuit inspire hooray chime sit awake time shamm fagg fact remember thoughtless elder leave biscuit prize night walking adventurer nerve steel tumble bed pull baggy old pair knickerbocker bare shank girt belt thrust side large wooden pistol other old single stick don big slouch hat uncle use play second tree audience possible dress part care conscientiousness true care mounting piece real dramatic heart beat sound commander enjoin silence deep grave remind sleep open door past file short cut blue wary course forget lead way blue prehistoric time add superfluous passage advantage door enable head stair pass chamber dragon aunt lay couch occupy casual uncle night enter noiseless file room plunge darkness bright strip moonlight floor pass exit lead lady choose pause seize opportunity study hang new dress gown satisfy thereat proceed feminine fashion peacock pose pace minuet moonlit patch imaginary partner much histrionic instinct moment pause draw single stick flourishe meet occasion strode stage struggle ensue approve line end stab unction corpse borne chamber ruthless cavalier rest rush clump caper gesticulation delight special charm performance lie necessity carry dumbest dumb show dark landing noise storm exaggerate necessity silence grasp tail other nightgown climber rope perilous place fare staircase moraine grim glacier hall faint glimmer half open door draw room beckon friendly hostel light enter find thriftless senior leave sound red heart fire coax cheerful blaze biscuit plateful smile encourage sort way half lemon squeeze suckable biscuit share lemon segment pass mouth mouth squatet fire genial warmth consol unclad limb realise many nocturnal peril brave vain funny thing chate hate room daytime mean face wash hair brush talk silly company talk night jolly different person tea own tea home like poor person jam thing drink saucer suck finger enjoy long way sit foot bar chair cup talk same sort stuff time sniff society call other proper thing society more day retort ask growl chance rejoin sister claim right last word heat amenity understand art polite conversation like society person put sofa sprawl full length sight daylight hour blush witness afternoon station find dead mouse lawn want skin sure garden patt head wish person ask pick flower pick right hold mouse scream throw cat run believe mouse time lose angry want throw mouse
