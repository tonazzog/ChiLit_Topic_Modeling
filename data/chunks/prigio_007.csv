"CHAPTER VI. _What Happened to Prince Prigio in Town_ BY this time the prince was very hungry. The town was just three miles off; but he had such a royal appetite, that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery, and the people of the royal town were bad cooks. “I wish I were in ‘The Bear,’ at Gluck-stein,” said he to himself; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there. But, then, the town was twenty-one leagues away--sixty-three long miles! No sooner had the prince said this, and taken just three steps, than he found himself at the door of the “Bear Inn” at Gluckstein! “This is the most extraordinary dream,” said he to himself; for he was far too clever, of course, to believe in seven-league boots. Yet he had a pair on at that very moment, and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to Gluckstein! The truth is, that the prince, in looking about the palace for clothes, had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother, who did not believe in them. But this, of course, the prince did not know. Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you _want_ to go a long distance. Otherwise they would be very inconvenient--when you only want to cross the room, for example. Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess? Well, the prince walked into “The Bear,” and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him. And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in Pantouflia; for everybody had seen it, at least in pictures. He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual, that _he quite forgot to take off his cap_.  He sat down at a table, however, and shouted “_Kellner!_” at which all the waiters jumped, and looked round in every direction, but nobody came to him. At first he thought they were too busy, but presently another explanation occurred to him. “The king,” said he to himself, “has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me, or helps me in any way. Well, I don’t mean to starve in the midst of plenty, anyhow; here goes!” The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the room, where a huge roast turkey had just been placed. He helped himself to half the breast, some sausages, chestnut stuffing, bread sauce, potatoes, and a bottle of red wine--Burgundy. He then went back to a table in a corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of him. When he had finished, he sat watching the other people dining, and smoking his cigarette. As he was sitting thus, a very tall man, an officer in the uniform of the Guards, came in, and, walking straight to the prince’s table, said: “Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of fare.” With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the prince’s lap, as if he did not see him at all. He was a heavy man, and the prince, enraged at the insult, pushed him away and jumped to his feet. As he did so, _his cap dropped off_. The officer fell on his knees at once, crying: “Pardon, my prince, pardon! I never saw you!” This was more than the prince could be expected to believe. “Nonsense! Count Frederick von Matterhorn,” he said; “you must be intoxicated. Sir! you have insulted your prince and your superior officer. Consider yourself under arrest! You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow.” On this, the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern. They all declared that they had not seen the prince, nor ever had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town. More and more offended, and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him, the prince shouted for the landlord, called for his bill, threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change, and went into the street. “It is a disgraceful conspiracy,” he said. “The king shall answer for this! I shall write to the newspapers at once!” He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street. They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him, and then staggered back in the greatest surprise, looking in every direction for the person they had jostled. In one of these encounters, the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down. As he was usually most kind and polite, he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon, when, behold, the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream, and fainted! A crowd was collecting, and the prince, forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern, pulled out his purse. Then he remembered what he had done, and expected to find it empty; but, lo, there were three pieces of gold in it! Overcome with surprise, he thrust the money into the woman’s hand, and put on his cap again. In a moment the crowd, which had been staring at him, rushed away in every direction, with cries of terror, declaring that there was a magician in the town, and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure!  By this time, you or I, or anyone who was not so extremely clever as Prince Prigio, would have understood what was the matter. He had put on, without knowing it, not only the seven-league boots, but the cap of darkness, and had taken Fortunatus’s purse, which could never be empty, however often you took all the money out. All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening, and the prince had found them in the dark garret. But the prince was so extremely wise, and learned, and scientific, that he did not believe in fairies, nor in fairy gifts. “It is indigestion,” he said to himself: “those sausages were not of the best; and that Burgundy was extremely strong. Things are not as they appear.” Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six, the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him. Annoyed at this, the prince leaped up behind, threw down the two footmen, who made no resistance, and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace. He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage; but, noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him, whom he had never seen before, he followed them into the house, not wishing to alarm the girl, and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone. A great ball was going on; but, as usual, nobody took any notice of the prince. He walked among the guests, being careful not to jostle them, and listening to their conversation. It was all about himself! Everyone had heard of his disgrace, and almost everyone cried “Serve him right!” They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable--that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right--that cleverness might be carried far too far--that it was better even to be born stupid (“Like the rest of you,” thought the prince); and, in fact, nobody had a good word for him. Yes, one had! It was the pretty lady of the carriage. I never could tell you how pretty she was. She was tall, with cheeks like white roses blushing: she had dark hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face was the kindest in the world! The prince first thought how nice and good she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked. _She_ stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him. She had never seen the prince, for she was but newly come to Pantouflia; but she declared that it was his _misfortune_, not his fault, to be so clever. “And, then, think how hard they made him work at school! Besides,” said this kind young lady, “I hear he is extremely handsome, and very brave; and he has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor boy, and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy passed first in _everything_. And now he is Minister for Education, though he can’t do a line of Greek prose!” ",happen time prince hungry town mile royal appetite like waste bad cookery person royal town bad cook wish remember cook town league long mile prince step find door extraordinary dream clever course believe league boot pair very moment carry stride palace truth prince palace clothes find way old lumber room magical gift fairy throw clever mother believe course prince league boot prodigious step long distance inconvenient want cross room example explain governess prince walk seem odd notice face man least picture puzzled attend usual forget sit table shout waiter jump direction first busy explanation occur king threaten execute speak help way mean starve midst plenty prince rise table midst room huge roast turkey place help breast sausages chestnut stuff bread sauce potato bottle red wine table corner dine notice finish sit watch other person dine smoke cigarette sit tall man officer uniform walk prince table clean table bring bill fare word officer sit prince lap heavy man prince enrage insult push jump foot cap drop officer fall knee cry pardon prince pardon more prince expect believe nonsense count intoxicated insult prince superior officer consider arrest send prison poor officer appeal tavern declare prince idea honour neighbourhood town more offend convince conspiracy annoy insult prince shout landlord call bill throw piece gold ask change street disgraceful conspiracy king answer write newspaper put temper way person hustle street run stagger great surprise direction person jostle encounter prince push poor old beggar woman fall kind polite pull cap beg pardon beggar woman give dreadful scream faint crowd collect prince forget throw money tavern pull purse remember expect find empty piece gold overcome surprise thrust money woman hand put cap moment crowd stare rush direction cry terror declare magician town fellow appear disappear pleasure time clever understand matter put league boot cap darkness purse empty money many other delightful ware fairy give christening prince find dark garret prince wise learn scientific believe fairy fairy gift indigestion sausages strong thing appear argue run splendid carriage driver slight notice annoy prince leap throw footmen resistance carry door magnificent palace determined challenge gentleman carriage notice beautiful young lady follow house wish alarm girl mean speak gentleman find great ball usual notice prince walk guest careful jostle listen conversation hear disgrace cry serve right air give unendurable rude right cleverness carry bear stupid rest prince fact word pretty lady carriage tall cheek white rose blush dark hair large dark grey eye face kindest world prince nice pretty stand partner speak ill prince declare fault clever work school kind young lady hear handsome brave heart kind hear poor boy examination paper boy pass line greek prose
