"CHAPTER XXIV. OLD IRON AND NEW STEEL  THE clear sunshine of early summer was becoming low on the hillsides. Sparkling and dimpling, the clear amber-coloured stream of the Braunwasser rippled along its stony bed, winding in and out among the rocks so humbly that it seemed to be mocked by the wide span of the arch that crossed it in all the might of massive bulwarks, and dignified masonry of huge stones. Some way above, a clearing of the wood below the mountain showed huts, and labourers apparently constructing a mill so as to take advantage of the leap of the water from the height above; and, on the left bank, an enclosure was traced out, within which were rising the walls of a small church, while the noise of the mallet and chisel echoed back from the mountain side, and masons, white with stone-dust, swarmed around. Across the bridge came a pilgrim, marked out as such by hat, wallet, and long staff, on which he leant heavily, stumbling along as if both halting and footsore, and bending as one bowed down by past toil and present fatigue.  Pausing in the centre, he gazed round with a strange disconcerted air—at the castle on the terraced hillside, looking down with bright eyes of glass glittering in the sunshine, and lighting up even that grim old pile; at the banner hanging so lazily that the tinctures and bearings were hidden in the folds; then at the crags, rosy purple in evening glow, rising in broad step above step up to the Red Eyrie, bathed in sunset majesty of dark crimson; and above it the sweep of the descending eagle, discernible for a moment in the pearly light of the sky.  The pilgrim’s eye lighted up as he watched it; but then, looking down at bridge, and church, and trodden wheel-tracked path, he frowned with perplexity, and each painful step grew heavier and more uncertain. Near the opposite side of the enclosure there waited a tall, rugged-looking, elderly man with two horses—one an aged mare, mane, tail, and all of the snowiest silvery white; the other a little shaggy dark mountain pony, with a pad-saddle.  And close to the bank of the stream might be seen its owner, a little girl of some seven years, whose tight round lace cap had slipped back, as well as her blue silk hood, and exposed a profusion of loose flaxen hair, and a plump, innocent face, intent upon some private little bit of building of her own with some pebbles from the brook, and some mortar filched from the operations above, to the great detriment of her soft pinky fingers. The pilgrim looked at her unperceived, and for a moment was about to address her; but then, with a strange air of repulsion, dragged himself on to the porch of the rising church, where, seated on a block of stone, he could look into the interior.  All was unfinished, but the portion which had made the most progress was a chantry-chapel opposite to the porch, and containing what were evidently designed to be two monuments. One was merely blocked out, but it showed the outline of a warrior, bearing a shield on which a coiled serpent was rudely sketched in red chalk.  The other, in a much more forward state, was actually under the hands of the sculptor, and represented a slender youth, almost a boy, though in the full armour of a knight, his hands clasped on his breast over a lute, an eagle on his shield, an eagle-crest on his helmet, and, under the arcade supporting the altar-tomb, shields alternately of eagles and doves. But the strangest thing was that this young knight seemed to be sitting for his own effigy.  The very same face, under the very same helmet, only with the varied, warm hues of life, instead of in cold white marble, was to be seen on the shoulders of a young man in a gray cloth dress, with a black scarf passing from shoulder to waist, crossed by a sword-belt.  The hair was hidden by the helmet, whose raised visor showed keen, finely-cut features, and a pair of dark brown eyes, of somewhat grave and sad expression. “Have a care, Lucas,” he presently said; “I fear me you are chiselling away too much.  It must be a softer, more rounded face than mine has become; and, above all, let it not catch any saddened look.  Keep that air of solemn waiting in glad hope, as though he saw the dawn through his closed eyelids, and were about to take up his song again!” “Verily, Herr Freiherr, now the likeness is so far forward, the actual sight of you may lead me to mar it rather than mend.” “So is it well that this should be the last sitting.  I am to set forth for Genoa in another week.  If I cannot get letters from the Kaisar, I shall go in search of him, that he may see that my lameness is no more an impediment.” The pilgrim passed his hand over his face, as though to dissipate a bewildering dream; and just then the little girl, all flushed and dabbled, flew rushing up from the stream, but came to a sudden standstill at sight of the stranger, who at length addressed her.  “Little lady,” he said, “is this the Debateable Ford?” “No; now it is the Friendly Bridge,” said the child. The pilgrim started, as with a pang of recollection.  “And what is yonder castle?” he further asked. “Schloss Adlerstein,” she said, proudly. “And you are the little lady of Adlerstein Wildschloss?” “Yes,” again she answered; and then, gathering courage—“You are a holy pilgrim!  Come up to the castle for supper and rest.”  And then, springing past him, she flew up to the knight, crying, “Herr Freiherr, here is a holy pilgrim, weary and hungry.  Let us take him home to the mother.” ",old new steel clear sunshine early summer become low hillside sparkle dimple clear amber coloured stream ripple stony bed wind rock seem mock wide span arch cross might massive bulwark dignified masonry huge stone way clear wood mountain show hut labourer construct mill advantage leap water height left bank enclosure trace rise wall small church noise mallet chisel echoe mountain side mason white stone dust swarm bridge pilgrim mark such hat wallet long staff lean stumble halt footsore bending bow past toil present fatigue pause centre gaze strange disconcert air castle terrace hillside bright eye glass glitter sunshine light grim old pile banner hang tincture bearing hide fold crag rosy purple evening glow rise broad step step red bath sunset majesty dark crimson sweep descend eagle discernible moment pearly light sky pilgrim eye light watch bridge church trodd wheel track path frown perplexity painful step grow heavy uncertain opposite side enclosure wait tall rugged elderly man horse aged mare mane tail snowiest silvery white other shaggy dark mountain pony pad saddle bank stream owner girl year tight round lace cap slip blue silk hood expose profusion loose flaxen hair plump innocent face intent private bit building own pebble brook mortar filch operation great detriment soft pinky finger pilgrim unperceived moment about address strange air repulsion drag porch rise church seat block stone interior unfinished portion most progress chantry chapel porch contain design monument block show outline warrior bear shield coiled serpent sketch red chalk other forward state hand sculptor represent slender youth boy full armour knight hand clasp breast lute eagle shield eagle crest helmet arcade support altar tomb shield eagle dove strangest thing young knight seem sit own effigy same face same helmet varied warm hue life cold white marble shoulder young man gray cloth dress black scarf pass shoulder waist cross sword belt hair hide helmet raise visor show keen cut feature pair dark brown eye grave sad expression care fear chisell much softer round face become let catch sadden keep air solemn waiting glad hope dawn close eyelid about song likeness actual sight lead mend well last sitting set week letter search lameness impediment pilgrim pass hand face dissipate bewildering dream girl flush dabble fly rush stream sudden standstill sight stranger length address lady debateable friendly child pilgrim start pang recollection yonder castle ask  lady answer gather courage holy pilgrim castle supper rest spring fly knight cry holy pilgrim weary hungry let mother 
"“Did he take thee for a wild elf?” said the young man, with an elder-brotherly endeavour to right the little cap that had slidden under the chin, and to push back the unmanageable wealth of hair under it, ere he rose; and he came forward and spoke with kind courtesy, as he observed the wanderer’s worn air and feeble step.  “Dost need a night’s lodging, holy palmer?  My mother will make thee welcome, if thou canst climb as high as the castle yonder.” The pilgrim made an obeisance, but, instead of answering, demanded hastily, “See I yonder the bearing of Schlangenwald?” “Even so.  Schloss Schlangenwald is about a league further on, and thou wilt find a kind reception there, if thither thou art bent.” “Is that Graff Wolfgang’s tomb?” still eagerly pursued the pilgrim; and receiving a sign in the affirmative, “What was his end?” “He fell in a skirmish.” “By whose hand?” “Ha!” and the pilgrim surveyed him with undisguised astonishment; then, without another word, took up his staff and limped out of the building, but not on the road to Schlangenwald.  It was nearly a quarter of an hour afterwards that he was overtaken by the young knight and the little lady on their horses, just where the new road to the castle parted from the old way by the Eagle’s Ladder.  The knight reined up as he saw the poor man’s slow, painful steps, and said, “So thou art not bound for Schlangenwald?” “I would to the village, so please you—to the shrine of the Blessed Friedmund.” “Nay, at this rate thou wilt not be there till midnight,” said the young knight, springing off his horse; “thou canst never brook our sharp stones!  See, Thekla, do thou ride on with Heinz to tell the mother I am bringing her a holy pilgrim to tend.  And thou, good man, mount my old gray.  Fear not; she is steady and sure-footed, and hath of late been used to a lame rider.  Ah! that is well.  Thou hast been in the saddle before.” To go afoot for the sake of giving a lift to a holy wayfarer was one of the most esteemed acts of piety of the Middle Age, so that no one durst object to it, and the palmer did no more than utter a suppressed murmur of acknowledgment as he seated himself on horseback, the young knight walking by his rein.  “But what is this?” he exclaimed, almost with dismay.  “A road to the castle up here!” “Yes, we find it a great convenience.  Thou art surely from these parts?” added the knight. “I was a man-at-arms in the service of the Baron,” was the answer, in an odd, muffled tone. “What!—of my grandfather!” was the exclamation. “No!” gruffly.  “Of old Freiherr Eberhard.  Not of any of the Wildschloss crew.” “But I am not a Wildschloss!  I am grandson to Freiherr Eberhard!  Oh, wast thou with him and my father when they were set upon in the hostel?” he cried, looking eagerly up to the pilgrim; but the man kept his broad-leaved hat slouched over his face, and only muttered, “The son of Christina!” the last word so low that Ebbo was not sure that he caught it, and the next moment the old warrior exclaimed exultingly, “And you have had vengeance on them!  When—how—where?” “Last harvest-tide—at the Debateable Strand,” said Ebbo, never able to speak of the encounter without a weight at his heart, but drawn on by the earnestness of the old foe of Schlangenwald.  “It was a meeting in full career—lances broken, sword-stroke on either hand.  I was sore wounded, but my sword went through his collar-bone.” “Well struck! good stroke!” cried the pilgrim, in rapture.  “And with that sword?” “With this sword.  Didst know it?” said Ebbo, drawing the weapon, and giving it to the old man, who held it for a few moments, weighed it affectionately, and with a long low sigh restored it, saying, “It is well.  You and that blade have paid off the score.  I should be content. Let me dismount.  I know my way to the hermitage.” “Nay, what is this?” said Ebbo; “thou must have rest and food.  The hermitage is empty, scarce habitable.  My mother will not be balked of the care of thy bleeding feet.” “But let me go, ere I bring evil on you all.  I can pray up there, and save my soul, but I cannot see it all.” “See what?” said Ebbo, again trying to see his guest’s face.  “There may be changes, but an old faithful follower of my father’s must ever be welcome.” “Not when his wife has taken a new lord,” growled the stranger, bitterly, “and he a Wildschloss!  Young man, I could have pardoned aught else!” “I know not who you may be who talk of pardoning my lady-mother,” said Ebbo, “but new lord she has neither taken nor will take.  She has refused every offer; and, now that Schlangenwald with his last breath confessed that he slew not my father, but sold him to the Turks, I have been only awaiting recovery from my wound to go in search of him.” “Who then is yonder child, who told me she was Wildschloss?” “That child,” said Ebbo, with half a smile and half a blush, “is my wife, the daughter of Wildschloss, who prayed me to espouse her thus early, that so my mother might bring her up.” By this time they had reached the castle court, now a well-kept, lordly-looking enclosure, where the pilgrim looked about him as one bewildered.  He was so infirm that Ebbo carefully helped him up the stone stairs to the hall, where he already saw his mother prepared for the hospitable reception of the palmer.  Leaving him at the entrance, Ebbo crossed the hall to say to her in a low voice, “This pilgrim is one of the old lanzknechts of my grandfather’s time.  I wonder whether you or Heinz will know him.  One of the old sort—supremely discontented at change.” “And thou hast walked up, and wearied thyself!” exclaimed Christina, grieved to see her son’s halting step. “A rest will soon cure that,” said Ebbo, seating himself as he spoke on a settle near the hall fire; but the next moment a strange wild low shriek from his mother made him start up and spring to her side.  She stood with hands clasped, and wondering eyes.  The pilgrim—his hat on the ground, his white head and rugged face displayed—was gazing as though devouring her with his eyes, murmuring, “Unchanged! unchanged!” “What is this!” thundered the young Baron.  “What are you doing to the lady?” “Hush! hush, Ebbo!” exclaimed Christina.  “It is thy father!  On thy knees!  Thy father is come!  It is our son, my own lord.  Oh, embrace him!  Kneel to him, Ebbo!” she wildly cried.

"“Hold, mother,” said Ebbo, keeping his arm round her, though she struggled against him, for he felt some doubts as he looked back at his walk with the stranger, and remembered Heinz’s want of recognition.  “Is it certain that this is indeed my father?” “Oh, Ebbo,” was the cry of poor Christina, almost beside herself, “how could I not be sure?  I know him!  I feel it!  Oh, my lord, bear with him.  It is his wont to be so loving!  Ebbo, cannot you see it is himself?” “The young fellow is right,” said the stranger, slowly.  “I will answer all he may demand.” “Forgive me,” said Ebbo, abashed, “forgive me;” and, as his mother broke from him, he fell upon his knee; but he only heard his father’s cry, “Ah! Stine, Stine, thou alone art the same,” and, looking up, saw her, with her face hidden in the white beard, quivering with a rapture such as he had never seen in her before.  It seemed long to him ere she looked up again in her husband’s face to sob on: “My son!  Oh! my beautiful twins! Our son!  Oh, see him, dear lord!”  And the pilgrim turned to hear Ebbo’s “Pardon, honoured father, and your blessing.” Almost bashfully the pilgrim laid his hand on the dark head, and murmured something; then said, “Up, then!  The slayer of Schlangenwald kneeling! Ah!  Stine, I knew thy little head was wondrous wise, but I little thought thou wouldst breed him up to avenge us on old Wolfgang!  So slender a lad too!  Ha!  Schneiderlein, old rogue, I knew thee,” holding out his hand.  “So thou didst get home safe?” “Ay, my lord; though, if I left you alive, never more will I call a man dead,” said Heinz. “Worse luck for me—till now,” said Sir Eberhard, whose tones, rather than his looks, carried perfect conviction of his identity.  It was the old homely accent, and gruff good-humoured voice, but with something subdued and broken in the tone.  His features had grown like his father’s, but he looked much older than ever the hale old mountaineer had done, or than his real age; so worn and lined was his face, his skin tanned, his eyelids and temples puckered by burning sun, his hair and beard white as the inane of his old mare, the proud Adlerstein port entirely gone.  He stooped even more without his staff than with it; and, when he yielded himself with a sigh of repose to his wife’s tendance, she found that he had not merely the ordinary hurts of travelling, but that there were old festering scars on his ankles.  “The gyves,” he said, as she looked up at him, with startled, pitying eyes.  “Little deemed I that they would ever come under thy tender hands.”  As he almost timidly smoothed the braid of dark hair on her brow—“So they never burnt thee for a witch after all, little one?  I thought my mother would never keep her hands off thee, and used to fancy I heard the crackling of the flame.” “She spared me for my children’s sake,” said Christina; “and truly Heaven has been very good to us, but never so much as now.  My dear lord, will it weary thee too much to come to the castle chapel and give thanks?” she said, timidly. “With all my heart,” he answered, earnestly.  “I would go even on my knees.  We were not without masses even in Tunis; but, when Italian and Spaniard would be ransomed, and there was no mind of the German, I little thought I should ever sing Brother Lambert’s psalm about turning our captivity as rivers in the south.” Ebbo was hovering round, supplying all that was needed for his father’s comfort; but his parents were so completely absorbed in one another that he was scarcely noticed, and, what perhaps pained him more, there was no word about Friedel.  He felt this almost an injustice to the brother who had been foremost in embracing the idea of the unknown father, and scarcely understood how his parents shrank from any sorrowful thought that might break in on their new-found joy, nor that he himself was so strange and new a being in his father’s eyes, that to imagine him doubled was hardly possible to the tardy, dulled capacity, which as yet seemed unable to feel anything but that here was home, and Christina. When the chapel bell rang, and the pair rose to offer their thanksgiving, Ebbo dutifully offered his support, but was absolutely unseen, so fondly was Sir Eberhard leaning on his wife; and her bright exulting smile and shake of the head gave an absolute pang to the son who had hitherto been all in all to her. He followed, and, as they passed Friedmund’s coffin, he thought his mother pointed to it, but even of this he was uncertain.  The pair knelt side by side with hands locked together, while notes of praise rose from all voices; and meantime Ebbo, close to that coffin, strove to share the joy, and to lift up a heart that _would_ sink in the midst of self-reproach for undutifulness, and would dislike the thought of the rude untaught man, holding aloof from him, likely to view him with distrust and jealousy, and to undo all he had achieved, and further absorbing the mother, the mother who was to him all the world, and for whose sake he had given his best years to the child-wife, as yet nothing to him. It was reversing the natural order of things that, after reigning from infancy, he should have to give up at eighteen to one of the last generation; and some such thought rankled in his mind when the whole household trooped joyfully out of the chapel to prepare a banquet for their old new lord, and their young old lord was left alone. Alone with the coffin where the armour lay upon the white cross, Ebbo threw himself on his knees, and laid his head upon it, murmuring, “Ah, Friedel!  Friedel!  Would that we had changed places!  Thou wouldst brook it better.  At least thou didst never know what it is to be lonely.” “Herr Baron!” said a little voice. His first movement was impatient.  Thekla was apt to pursue him wherever he did not want her; but here he had least expected her, for she had a great fear of that coffin, and could hardly be brought to the chapel at prayer times, when she generally occupied herself with fancies that the empty helmet glared at her.  But now Ebbo saw her standing as near as she durst, with a sweet wistfulness in her eyes, such as he had never seen there before. “What is it, Thekla?” he said.  “Art sent to call me?” “No; only I saw that you stayed here all alone,” she said, clasping her hands.   [“‘No; only I saw that you stayed here all alone,’ she said,                      clasping her hands.”  Page 269] “Must I not be alone, child?” he said, bitterly.  “Here lies my brother. My mother has her husband again!” “But you have me!” cried Thekla; and, as he looked up between amusement and melancholy, he met such a loving eager little face, that he could not help holding out his arms, and letting her cling to him.  “Indeed,” she said, “I’ll never be afraid of the helmet again, if only you will not lay down your head there, and say you are alone.” ",hold mother keep arm struggle feel doubt walk stranger remember want recognition certain father cry poor sure feel lord bear loving young fellow right stranger answer demand forgive abash forgive mother break fall knee hear father cry alone art same face hide white beard quiver rapture such seem husband face sob son beautiful twin son dear lord pilgrim turn hear pardon honoure father blessing pilgrim lay hand dark head murmure slayer kneel head wondrous wise breed avenge old slender lad old rogue hold hand safe lord leave alive call man dead bad luck tone carry perfect conviction identity old homely accent gruff humoured voice subdued break tone feature grow father old hale old mountaineer real age wear line face skin tann eyelid temple pucker burn sun hair beard white inane old mare proud port gone stoop staff yield sigh repose wife tendance find ordinary hurt travel old fester scar ankle gyve startle pity eye deem tender hand smooth braid dark hair brow burn witch one mother keep hand use fancy hear crackling flame spare child sake heaven dear lord weary much castle chapel give thanks heart answer knee mass italian ransome mind sing psalm turn captivity river south hover supply need father comfort parent absorb notice pain word feel injustice brother foremost embrace idea unknown father understand parent shrank sorrowful thought break new find joy strange new father eye imagine double possible tardy dull capacity seem unable feel home chapel bell ring pair rise offer thanksgiving offer support unseen lean wife bright exult smile shake head give absolute pang son follow pass coffin mother point uncertain pair knolt side side hand lock note praise rise voice meantime close coffin strive share joy lift heart sink midst self reproach undutifulness dislike thought rude untaught man hold aloof likely view distrust jealousy undo achieve absorb mother mother world sake give year child wife reverse natural order thing reign infancy give last generation such thought rankle mind whole household troop chapel prepare banquet old new lord young old lord leave alone coffin armour lay white cross throw knee lay head murmure change place briok least lonely voice first movement impatient apt pursue want least expect great fear coffin bring chapel prayer time occupy fancy empty helmet glare standing durst sweet wistfulness eye such art send call stay clasp hand stay clasp hand page alone child lie brother mother husband cry amusement melancholy meet loving eager face help hold arm let cling afraid helmet lay head alone 
"“Never, Thekla! while you are my little wife,” said he; and, child as she was, there was strange solace to his heart in the eyes that, once vacant and wondering, had now gained a look of love and intelligence. “What are you going to do?” she said, shuddering a little, as he rose and laid his hand on Friedel’s sword. “To make thee gird on thine own knight’s sword,” said Ebbo, unbuckling that which he had so long worn.  “Friedel,” he added, “thou wouldst give me thine.  Let me take up thy temper with it, thine open-hearted love and humility.” He guided Thekla’s happy little fingers to the fastening of the belt, and then, laying his hand on hers, said gravely, “Thekla, never speak of what I said just now—not even to the mother.  Remember, it is thy husband’s first secret.” And feeling no longer solitary when his hand was in the clasp of hers, he returned to the hall, where his father was installed in the baronial chair, in which Ebbo had been at home from babyhood.  His mother’s exclamation showed that her son had been wanting to her; and she looked fuller than ever of bliss when Ebbo gravely stood before his father, and presented him with the good old sword that he had sent to his unborn son. “You are like to use it more than I,—nay, you have used it to some purpose,” said he.  “Yet must I keep mine old comrade at least a little while.  Wife, son, sword, should make one feel the same man again, but it is all too wonderful!” All that evening, and long after, his hand from time to time sought the hilt of his sword, as if that touch above all proved to him that he was again a free noble in his own castle. The story he told was thus.  The swoon in which Heinz had left him had probably saved his life by checking the gush of blood, and he had known no more till he found himself in a rough cart among the corpses.  At Schlangenwald’s castle he had been found still breathing, and had been flung into a dungeon, where he lay unattended, for how long he never knew, since all the early part of the time was lost in the clouds of fever.  On coarse fare and scanty drink, in that dark vault, he had struggled by sheer obstinacy of vitality into recovery.  In the very height of midsummer alone did the sun peep through the grating of his cell, and he had newly hailed this cheerful visitor when he was roughly summoned, placed on horseback with eyes and hands bound, and only allowed sight again to find himself among a herd of his fellow Germans in the Turkish camp.  They were the prisoners of the terrible Turkish raid of 1475, when Georg von Schenk and fourteen other noblemen of Austria and Styria were all taken in one unhappy fight, and dragged away into captivity, with hundreds of lower rank. To Sir Eberhard the change had been greatly for the better.  The Turk had treated him much better than the Christian; and walking in the open air, chained to a German comrade, was far pleasanter than pining in his lonely dungeon.  At Adrianople, an offer had been made to each of the captives, if they would become Moslems, of entering the Ottoman service as Spahis; but with one voice they had refused, and had then been draughted into different divisions.  The fifteen nobles, who had been offered for ransom, were taken to Constantinople, to await its arrival, and they had promised Sir Eberhard to publish his fate on their return to their homes; and, though he knew the family resources too well to have many hopes, he was rather hurt to find that their promise had been unfulfilled. “Alas! they had no opportunity,” said Ebbo.  “Gulden were scarce, or were all in Kaisar Friedrich’s great chest; the ransoms could not be raised, and all died in captivity.  I heard about it when I was at Wurms last month.” “The boy at Wurms?” almost gasped Sir Eberhard in amaze. “I had to be there about matters concerning the Wildschloss lands and the bridge,” said Ebbo; “and both Dankwart von Schlangenwald and I made special inquiries about that company in case you should have shared their fate.  I hoped to have set forth at that time, but the Kaisar said I was still too lame, and refused me license, or letters to the Sultan.” “You would not have found me,” said his father, narrating how he with a large troop of captives had been driven down to the coast; where they were transferred to a Moorish slave-dealer, who shipped them off for Tunis.  Here, after their first taste of the miseries of a sea life, the alternative of Islam or slavery was again put before them.  “And, by the holy stone of Nicæa,” said Sir Eberhard, “I thought by that time that the infidels had the advantage of us in good-will and friendliness; but, when they told me women had no souls at all, no more than a horse or dog, I knew it was but an empty dream of a religion; for did I not know that my little Ermentrude, and thou, Stine, had finer, clearer, wiser souls than ever a man I had known?  ‘Nay, nay,’ quoth I, ‘I’ll cast in my lot where I may meet my wife hereafter, should I never see her here.’”  He had then been allotted to a corsair, and had thenceforth been chained to the bench of rowers, between the two decks, where, in stifling heat and stench, in storm or calm, healthy or diseased, the wretched oarsmen were compelled to play the part of machinery in propelling the vessel, in order to capture Christian ships—making exertions to which only the perpetual lash of the galley-master could have urged their exhausted frames; often not desisting for twenty or thirty hours, and rowing still while sustenance was put into their mouths by their drivers.  Many a man drew has last breath with his last stroke, and was at the first leisure moment hurled into the waves.  It was the description that had so deeply moved Friedel long ago, and Christina wept over it, as she looked at the bowed form once so proud and free, and thought of the unhealed scars.  But there, her husband added, he had been chained next to a holy friar of German blood, like himself a captive of the great Styrian raid; and, while some blasphemed in their misery, or wildly chid their patron saints, this good man strove to show that all was to work out good; he had a pious saying for all that befell, and adored the will of God in thus purifying him; “And, if it were thus with a saint like him, I thought, what must it be with a rough freebooting godless sinner such as I had been?  See”—and he took out a rosary of strung bladders of seaweed; “that is what he left me when he died, and what I meant to have been telling for ever up in the hermitage.” “He died, then?” “Ay—he died on the shore of Corsica, while most of the dogs were off harrying a village inland, and we had a sort of respite, or I trow he would have rowed till his last gasp.  How he prayed for the poor wretches they were gone to attack!—ay, and for all of us—for me also—There’s enough of it.

"It was plain that Sir Eberhard had learnt more Christianity in the hold of his Moorish pirate ship than ever in the Holy Roman Empire, and a weight was lifted off his son’s mind by finding that he had vowed never to return to a life of violence, even though fancying a life of penance in a hermitage the only alternative. Ebbo asked if the Genoese merchant, Ser Gian Battista dei Battiste, had indeed been one of his fellow-captives. “Ha!—what?” and on the repetition, “Truly I knew him, Merchant Gian as we used to call him; but you twang off his name as they speak it in his own stately city.” Christina smiled.  “Ebbo learnt the Italian tongue this winter from our chaplain, who had studied at Bologna.  He was told it would aid in his quest of you.” “Tell me not!” said the traveller, holding up his hands in deprecation; “the Junker is worse than a priest!  And yet he killed old Wolfgang!  But what of Gian?  Hold,—did not he, when I was with him at Genoa, tell me a story of being put into a dungeon in a mountain fortress in Germany, and released by a pair of young lads with eyes beaming in the sunrise, who vanished just as they brought him to a cloister?  Nay, he deemed it a miracle of the saints, and hung up a votive picture thereof at the shrine of the holy Cosmo and Damian.” “He was not so far wrong in deeming _one_ of the lads near of kin to the holy ones,” said Christina, softly. And Ebbo briefly narrated the adventure, when it evidently appeared that his having led at least one foray gave his father for the first time a fellow-feeling for him, and a sense that he was one of the true old stock; but, when he heard of the release, he growled, “So!  How would a lad have fared who so acted in my time?  My poor old mother!  She must have been changed indeed not to have scourged him till he had no strength to cry out.” “He was my prisoner!” said Ebbo, in his old defiant tone; “I had the right.” “Ah, well! the Junker has always been master here, and I never!” said the elder knight, looking round rather piteously; and Ebbo, with a sudden movement, exclaimed, “Nay, sir, you are the only lord and master, and I stand ready to be the first to obey you.” “You!  A fine young book-learned scholar, already knighted, and with all these Wildschloss lands too!” said Sir Eberhard, gazing with a strange puzzled look at the delicate but spirited features of this strange perplexing son.  “Reach hither your hand, boy.” And as he compared the slender, shapely hand of such finely-textured skin with the breadth of his own horny giant’s paw, he tossed it from him, shaking his head with a gesture as if he had no commands for such feminine-looking fingers to execute, and mortifying Ebbo not a little. “Ah!” said Christina, apologetically, “it always grieved your mother that the boys would resemble me and mine.  But, when daylight comes, Ebbo will show you that he has not lost the old German strength.” “No doubt—no doubt,” said Sir Eberhard, hastily, “since he has slain Schlangenwald; and, if the former state of things be at an end, the less he takes after the ancient stock the better.  But I am an old man now, Stine, though thou look’st fair and fresh as ever, and I do not know what to make of these things.  White napery on the table; glass drinking things;—nay, were it not for thee and the Schneiderlein, I should not know I was at home.” He was led back to his narration, and it appeared that, after some years spent at the oar, certain bleedings from the lungs, the remains of his wound, had become so much more severe as to render him useless for naval purposes; and, as he escaped actually dying during a voyage, he was allowed to lie by on coming into port till he had in some degree recovered, and then had been set to labour at the fortifications, chained to another prisoner, and toiling between the burning sand and burning sun, but treated with less horrible severity than the necessities of the sea had occasioned on board ship, and experiencing the benefit of intercourse with the better class of captives, whom their miserable fate had thrown into the hands of the Moors. It was a favourite almsdeed among the Provençals, Spaniards, and Italians to send money for the redemption of prisoners to the Moors, and there was a regular agency for ransoms through the Jews; but German captives were such an exception that no one thought of them, and many a time had the summons come for such and such a slave by name, or for five poor Sicilians, twenty Genoese, a dozen Marseillais, or the like, but still no word for the Swabian; till he had made up his mind that he should either leave his bones in the hot mud of the harbour, or be only set free by some gallant descent either of the brave King of Portugal, or of the Knights of Rhodes, of whom the captives were ever dreaming and whispering. At length his own slave name was shouted; he was called up by the captain of his gang, and, while expecting some fresh punishment, or, maybe, to find himself sold into some domestic form of slavery, he was set before a Jewish agent, who, after examining him on his name, country, and station, and comparing his answers with a paper of instructions, informed him that he was ransomed, caused his fetters to be struck off, and shipped him off at once for Genoa, with orders to the captain to consign him to the merchant Signor del Battiste.  By him Sir Eberhard had been received with the warmest hospitality, and treated as befitted his original station, but Battista disclaimed the merit of having ransomed him.  He had but acted, he said, as the agent of an Austrian gentleman, from whom he had received orders to inquire after the Swabian baron who had been his fellow-captive, and, if he were still living, to pay his ransom, and bring him home. “The name—the name!” eagerly asked Ebbo and his mother at once. “The name?  Gian was wont to make bad work of our honest German names, but I tried to learn this—being so beholden to him.  I even caused it to be spelt over to me, but my letters long ago went from me.  It seems to me that the man is a knight-errant, like those of thy ballads, Stine—one Ritter Theur—Theur—” “Theurdank!” cried Ebbo. “Ay, Theurdank.  What, you know him?  There is nothing you and your mother don’t know, I believe.” “Know him!  Father, he is our greatest and noblest!  He has been kind to me beyond description.  He is the Kaisar!  Now I see why he had that strange arch look which so vexed me when he forbade me on my allegiance to set forth till my lameness should be gone!  Long ago had he asked me all about Gian Battista.  To him he must have written.” “The Kaisar!” said Sir Eberhard.  “Nay, the poor fellows I left in Turkey ever said he was too close of fist for them to have hope from him.” “Oh! that was old Kaisar Friedrich.  This is our own gallant Maximilian—a knight as true and brave as ever was paladin,” said Christina; “and most truly loving and prizing our Ebbo.” ",plain learn more hold moorish pirate ship holy roman weight lift son mind find vow return life violence fancy life penance hermitage only alternative ask genoese merchant fellow captive repetition use call twang name speak own stately city smile learn italian tongue winter chaplain study aid quest traveller hold hand deprecation bad priest kill old hold story put dungeon mountain fortress release pair young lad eye beam sunrise vanish bring cloister deem miracle saint hang votive picture shrine holy wrong deem lad kin holy one narrate adventure appear lead least foray give father first time fellow feeling sense true old stock hear release growl lad fare act time poor old mother change scourge strength cry prisoner old defiant tone right master elder knight sudden movement exclaim sir only lord master stand ready first obey fine young book learn scholar knight land gaze strange puzzle delicate spirit feature strange perplexing son reach hand boy compare slender shapely hand such texture skin breadth own horny giant paw toss shake head gesture command such feminine finger execute mortify grieve mother boy resemble daylight show lose old german strength doubt slain former state thing end less ancient stock old man fair fresh thing white napery table glass drink thing home lead narration appear year spend oar certain bleeding lung remains wound become severe render useless naval purpose escape die voyage allow lie port degree recover set labour fortification chain prisoner toil burning sand burning sun treat horrible severity necessity sea occasion board ship experience benefit intercourse class captive miserable fate throw hand favourite almsdeed send money redemption prisoner regular agency ransom german captive exception time summons such slave name poor like word mind leave bone hot mud harbour set free gallant descent brave captive dreaming whisper length own slave name shout call captain gang expect fresh punishment find sell domestic form slavery set jewish agent examine name country station compare answer paper instruction inform ransome cause fetter strike ship order captain consign merchant receive warmest hospitality treat befit original station disclaim merit ransome act agent austrian gentleman receive order inquire swabian baron fellow captive live pay ransom bring name name ask mother name bad work honest german name try learn beholden cause spell letter seem man knight errant ballad cry mother believe father great noblest kind description strange arch vex forbid allegiance set lameness gone ask write poor fellow leave close fist hope old own gallant knight true brave paladin loving prize 
"“And yet I wish—I wish,” said Ebbo, “that he had let me win my father’s liberty for myself.” “Yea, well,” said his father, “there spoke the Adlerstein.  We never were wont to be beholden to king or kaisar.” “Nay,” say Ebbo, after a moment’s recollection, colouring as he spoke; “it is true that I deserved it not.  Nay, Sir Father, it is well.  You owe your freedom in very truth to the son you have not known.  It was he who treasured up the thought of the captive German described by the merchant, and even dreamt of it, while never doubting of your death; it was he who caught up Schlangenwald’s first hint that you lived, while I, in my pride, passed it by as merely meant to perplex me; it was he who had formed an absolute purpose of obtaining some certainty; and at last, when my impetuosity had brought on the fatal battle, it was he who bought with his own life the avowal of your captivity.  I had hoped to have fulfilled Friedel’s trust, and to have redeemed my own backwardness; but it is not to be.  While I was yet lying helpless on my bed, the Emperor has taken it out of my power.  Mother, you receive him from Friedel’s hands, after all.” “And well am I thankful that so it should be,” said Christina.  “Ah, Ebbo! sorely should I have pined with anxiety when thou wast gone.  And thy father knows that thou hadst the full purpose.” “Yea, I know it,” said the old man; “and, after all, small blame to him even if he had not.  He never saw me, and light grieves the heart for what the eye hath not seen.” “But,” added the wife, “since the Romish king freed you, dear lord, cared he not better for your journey than to let you come in this forlorn plight?” This, it appeared, was far from being his deliverer’s fault.  Money had been supplied, and Sir Eberhard had travelled as far as Aosta with a party of Italian merchants; but no sooner had he parted with them than he was completely astray.  His whole experience of life had been as a robber baron or as a slave, and he knew not how to take care of himself as a peaceful traveller; he suffered fresh extortions at every stage, and after a few days was plundered by his guides, beaten, and left devoid of all means of continuing the journey to which he could hardly hope for a cheerful end.  He did not expect to find his mother living,—far less that his unowned wife could have survived the perils in which he had involved her; and he believed that his ancestral home would, if not a ruin, be held by his foes, or at best by the rival branch of the family, whose welcome of the outlawed heir would probably be to a dungeon, if not a halter.  Yet the only magnet on earth for the lonely wanderer was his native mountain, where from some old peasant he might learn how his fair young bride had perished, and perhaps the sins of his youth might be expiated by continual prayer in the hermitage chapel where his sister lay buried, and whence he could see the crags for which his eye and heart had craved so long with the home-sickness of a mountaineer. And now, when his own Christina had welcomed him with all the overflow of her loving heart, unchanged save that hers had become a tenderer yet more dignified loveliness; when his gallant son, in all the bloom of young manhood, received him with dutiful submission; when the castle, in a state of defence, prosperity, and comfort of which he had never dreamt, was again his own;—still the old man was bewildered, and sometimes oppressed almost to distress.  He had, as it were, fallen asleep in one age of the world, and wakened in another, and it seemed as if he really wished to defer his wakening, or else that repose was an absolute novelty to him; for he sat dozing in his chair in the sun the whole of the next day, and scarcely spoke. Ebbo, who felt it a necessity to come to an understanding of the terms on which they were to stand, tried to refer matters to him, and to explain the past, but he was met sometimes by a shake of the head, sometimes by a nod—not of assent, but of sleep; and his mother advised him not to harass the wearied traveller, but to leave him to himself at least for that day, and let him take his own time for exertion, letting things meantime go on as usual.  Ebbo obeyed, but with a load at his heart, as he felt that all he was doing was but provisional, and that it would be his duty to resign all that he had planned, and partly executed, to this incompetent, ignorant rule.  He could certainly, when not serving the Emperor, go and act for himself at Thekla’s dower castle of Felsenbach, and his mother might save things from going to utter ruin at Adlerstein; but no reflection or self-reproach could make it otherwise than a bitter pill to any Telemachus to have to resign to one so unlike Ulysses in all but the length of his wanderings,—one, also, who seemed only half to like, and not at all to comprehend, his Telemachus. Meantime Ebbo attended to such matters as were sure to come each day before the Herr Freiherr.  Now it was a question whether the stone for the mill should be quarried where it would undermine a bit of grass land, or further on, where the road was rougher; now Berend’s swine had got into Barthel’s rye, and Barthel had severely hurt one of them—the Herr Freiherr’s interference could alone prevent a hopeless quarrel; now a waggon with ironwork for the mill claimed exemption from toll as being for the Baron: and he must send down the toll, to obviate injustice towards Schlangenwald and Ulm.  Old Ulrich’s grandson, who had run away for a lanzknecht, had sent a letter home (written by a comrade), the Baron must read and answer it.  Steinmark’s son wanted to be a poor student: the Herr Freiherr must write him a letter of recommendation. Mother Grethel’s ewe had fallen into a cleft; her son came to borrow a rope, and ask aid, and the Baron must superintend the hoisting the poor beast up again.  Hans had found the track of a wolf, and knew the hole where a litter of cubs abode; the Freiherr, his wolf-hound, and his spear were wanted for their destruction.  Dietrich could not tell how to manage his new arquebus: the Baron must teach him to take aim.  Then there was a letter from Ulm to invite the Baron to consult on the tax demanded by the Emperor for his Italian war, and how far it should concern the profits of the bridge; and another letter from the Markgraf of Wurtemburg, as chief of the Swabian League, requesting the Lord of Adlerstein to be on the look-out for a band of robbers, who were reported to be in neighbouring hills, after being hunted out of some of their other lurking-places.
