" ""What's these, what's these?"" he muttered, for there, on the farther bank of the stream, stood in the twilight of the sinking moon two strange, solitary figures, motionless, staring. Nod ran to Battle, and laid his long narrow hand on the glimmering gun-barrel. ""Oh, not shoot, not shoot!"" he said, ""black Oomgars--no; Mulla-mulgars, too, Nod's friends, Nod's brothers!"" ""What's he jabbering about?"" said Battle, with eyes fixed brightly on the two gaunt shapes. ""Nod's brothers, there,"" said Nod--""Thumb, Thimble, Thimble, Thumb. Nod show Oomgar. Oh, wait softly!"" He ran swiftly over the snow till he came to the frozen bank of the stream. But still his brothers never stirred, ragged and hollow-eyed with hunger and cold. ""Come,"" said Nod, lifting up his hands in salutation; ""there is no fear, no danger! Here is Nod, my brothers."" ""What voice was that we heard?"" said Thumb, trembling. ""Can the mouth of the Oomgar speak after it is shut in death?"" ""The Oomgar is not dead, Thumb, my brother; the hunting-packs killed only that Beast of Shadows, Immanâla, who hoped to kill us all, and the Oomgar, too. Come over, my brothers! Every day, every night, Nod has talked in his quiet with you."" ""We do not understand the little Oomgar,"" said Thimble angrily. ""Who are you, the youngest of us all, to lie and make cunning against the people of the forest? Let your master, the blood-spilling Oomgar, shoot us, too. What are we in such a heap of bones? We have no fear of him. On all fours, back, parakeet; tell him where the Mulgars' hearts lie hid. Maybe he'll fling his Nizza-neela a bone."" ""O Thimble, Mulla-mulgar, why do you seek out all the black words for me? Haven't I done all for the best? Did I play false with you when I saved you from the spits of the Minimuls? The little Horse of Tishnar smelt out my wounded shoulder. And the Oomgar's strangling trap caught me. But he did not kill me. He took me, and was kind to me, fed me and shared his fire with me, and we were 'messimuts.' Yet all day, all night, moon and no-moon, I have talked in myself with you, and run looking for you in my dreams, while I slept in the hairless Oomgar's hut. The Nameless is gone for a little while. The Oomgar is wise with his hands and in little things. Now I may go. He kills only for meat, Mulla-mulgars. He will do no harm to Ummanodda's brothers. Come over with me!"" Thumb and Thimble, with toes a little turned in, and heads bent forward, stood listening in the snow. ""Why, then,"" said Thumb, muttering, ""if he kills only for food, and relishes not his own flavour in the pot, let him hobble out here to us now and greet us, like with like--Oomgar-mulgar with Mulla-mulgar--and leave his spit-fire and his magic behind him. But into his hut, nor stumbling among his Munza bones, we will _not_ go. And if he will not come, brother to brother, then it is 'Gar Mulgar dusangee' between us three, O youngest son of Seelem. Go back to your cooking-pots. I and Thimble will journey on alone. All day would the Harp-strings be twangling over Mulgars smelling of blood."" So Nod, cold with misery, went back to Battle, who sat yawning, gun on knee, beside his fire. ""Oomgar!"" he said, leaning a little on one small hand, and standing a few paces distant from the sailor, ""my brothers, the Mulla-mulgars, sons of Seelem, brother of Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar, are here. They say Nod is not true, speaks lies, eater-of-flesh, no child of Tishnar."" He stared forlornly into Battle's face. ""Tired of his living is Nod now. Shoot straight with Oomgar Zbaffle's gun. Nod will be still."" The Englishman crinkled up his eyelids, opened his mouth, and burst out laughing. ""To tell ye sober truth, my son,"" he said, ""bullets and powder Battle haven't much left to waste. And what's lark-pie to a hungry sailor! As for them hunched-up hobbagoblins over yonder, don't 'ee heed what envy has to say. Battle is hands down on your side, my son, and let 'em meddle if they dare! But mercy on us,"" he added under his breath, ""what wouldn't my old mother have said to hear these Pongoes chatter? 'Shoot straight!' says he. 'Tired of his living!' says he. Button up your sheep's-jacket, my son. We'll home to England yet. And, what's more""--he waved his hand towards the lonely figures still standing motionless in the silvery dusk--""Andy Battle's best respects to the hairy gentlemen, and there's a warm welcome and fresh-picked bones for breakfast. But the night's creeping cold, and bed's bed, old friend, and Andy's eyes was never made for moth-hunting. So here goes."" He went in with his gun, and Nod heard him shut and bar the door. Nod listened awhile, with eyes fixed sorrowfully on the fast-shut door; then, having heaped more logs on to the fire, he went slowly back to his brothers. Now that the moon was down, and night at its darkest, the frost hardened. And Thumb and Thimble, when they were sure the Oomgar was asleep in his hut, were glad enough to hobble across the ice and to sit and warm themselves before the fire. Their jackets hung in tatters. Thumb's left second toe was frost-bitten, and Thimble's eyes were so sore from the glaring whiteness of the snow he could only dimly see. Moreover, they were weary of living and sleeping in their tree-houses among the scatter-brained Forest-mulgars, and though at first they sat shaky and sniffing, and started if but a dry leaf snapped in the fire, they listened in silence to Nod's long story of his doings, and began to see at last that what he had done by Mishcha's counsel had been for the best, and not for his own sake only. ""But we cannot stay here, Ummanodda,"" said Thumb. ""We could not rub noses with the Oomgar. His voice, his smell! He is not of our kind, little brother. And now that all the peoples of Munza-mulgar are our enemies, we must press on, with no more idling and fine eating and sitting shanks to fire, or we shall never reach the Valleys alive."" ""I am ready, Thumb, my brother,"" Nod answered. ""The Oomgar has been kind to me, his own kind's kind. It was my Tishnar's Wonderstone that saved him from the teeth of the Nine-and-ninety, and from Immanâla's magic, though why should I tell it is so? Now they will think it is his skin-bonneted Meermut that stalks to and fro with the ghost-gun of a ghost. They will forsake this place, every one--claw and talon, upright and fours, every one. How long shall a flesh-eater, hungry and gluttonous, live on dried berries and nuts? Me gone; unless the frost flies soon, or a great Bobberie, as he does say, comes up from that strange water, the Sea, over yonder, the Oomgar will die. O brothers, just as that Oomgar, the Portingal, died whose bones dangled over us when we stood by Mutta's knee and listened to them clicking. Do but let me stay to say good-bye, and we will go together at morning!""
