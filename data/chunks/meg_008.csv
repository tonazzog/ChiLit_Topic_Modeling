"CHAPTER VIII. Little Meg's Red Frock in Pawn Meg felt very forlorn when she opened her heavy eyelids the next morning.  It was certain now that her father could not be home for some time, it might be a long time; and how was she to buy bread for her children and herself?  She took down her mother's letter from the end of a shelf which supplied the place of a chimney-piece, and looked at it anxiously; but she dared not ask anybody to read it for her, lest it should contain some mention of the money hidden in the box; and that must be taken care of in every way, because it did not belong to her, or father even, but to one of his mates.  She had no friend to go to in all the great city.  Once she might have gone to the teacher at the school where she had learned to read a little; but that had been in quite a different part of London, on the other side of the river, and they had moved from it before her father had started on his last voyage.  Meg sat thinking and pondering sadly enough, until suddenly, how she did not know, her fears were all taken away, and her childish heart lightened.  She called Robin, and bade him kneel down beside her, and folding baby's hands together, she closed her own eyes, and bowed her head, while she asked God for the help He had promised to give. 'Pray God,' said little Meg, 'You've let mother die, and father be took bad at the other side of the world, and there's nobody to take care of us 'cept You, and Jesus says, if we ask You, You'll give us bread and everything we want, just like father and mother.  Pray God, do!  I'm not a grown-up person yet, and Robin's a very little boy, and baby can't talk or walk at all; but there's nobody else to do anythink for us, and we'll try as hard as we can to be good.  Pray God, bless father at the other side of the world, and Robbie, and baby, and me; and bless everybody, for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.' Meg rose from her knees joyfully, feeling sure that her prayer was heard and would be answered.  She went out with her children to lay out the shilling Kitty had returned to her the day before; and when they come in she and Robin sat down to a lesson in reading.  The baby was making a pilgrimage of the room from chair to chair, and along the bedstead; but all of a sudden she balanced herself steadily upon her tiny feet, and with a scream of mingled dread and delight, which made Meg and Robin look up quickly, she tottered across the open floor to the place where they were sitting, and hid her face in Meg's lap, quivering with joy and wonder.  Meg's gladness was full, except that there was a little feeling of sorrow that neither father nor mother was there to see it. 'Did God see baby walk?' inquired Robin. 'I should think He did!' said Meg confidently; and her slight sorrow fled away.  God could not help loving baby, she felt sure of that, nor Robin; and if He loved them, would He not take care of them Himself, and show her how to take care of them, till father was at home?  The day passed almost as happily as Robin's birthday; though the rain came down in torrents, and pattered through the roof, falling splash, splash into the broken tub, with a sound something like the fountain in Temple Gardens. But when Kitty's shilling was gone to the last farthing, and not a spoonful of meal remained in the bag, it was not easy to be happy. Robin and baby were both crying for food; and there was no coal to make a fire, nor any candle to give them light during the long dark evenings of November.  Kitty was out all day now, and did not get home till late, so Meg had not seen her since the night she had brought the news about her father.  But a bright thought came to her, and she wondered at herself for not having thought of it before.  She must pawn her best clothes; her red frock and bonnet with green ribbons.  There was a natural pang at parting with them, even for a time; but she comforted herself with the idea that father would get them back for her as soon as he returned.  She reached them out of the box, feeling carefully lest she should take any of Robin's or the baby's by mistake in the dark; and then she set off with her valuable bundle, wondering how many shillings she would get for them, and whether she could make the money last till her father came.  The pawnbroker's shop was a small, dingy place in Rosemary Lane; and it, and the rooms above it, were as full as they could be with bundles such as poor Meg carried under her old shawl.  A single gas-light was flaring away in the window, and a hard-featured, sharp-eyed man was reading a newspaper behind the counter.  Meg laid down her bundle timidly, and waited till he had finished reading his paragraph; after which he opened it, spread out the half-worn frock, and held up the bonnet on his fist, regarding them both with a critical and contemptuous eye.  Some one else had entered the shop, but Meg was too absorbed and too anxious to take any heed of it  The pawnbroker rolled the frock up scornfully, and gave it a push towards her. [The pawnbroker spread out the half-worn frock, and held up the bonnet on his fist.] 'Tenpence for the two,' he said, looking back at his newspaper. 'Oh! if you please,' cried little Meg, in an agony of distress, 'you must give me more than tenpence.  I've got two little children, and no bread, nor coals, nor candles.  I couldn't buy scarcely anythink with only tenpence.  Indeed, indeed, my red frock's worth a great deal more; it's worth I don't know how many shillings.' 'You go home, little Meg,' said Kitty's voice behind her, 'and I'll bring you three shillings for the frock, and one for the bonnet; four for the two.  Mr Sloman's an old friend o' mine, he is; and he'll oblige you for my sake.  There, you run away, and I'll manage this little bit o' business for you.' Meg ran away as she was told, glad enough to leave her business with Kitty.  By-and-by she heard her coming upstairs, and went out to meet her.  Kitty placed four shillings in her hand. 'Meg,' she said, 'you let me do that sort o' work for you always. They'll cheat you ever so; but I wouldn't, not to save my life, if you'll only trust me.  You ask me another time.  Is that the way God takes care of you?' 'He does take care of me,' answered Meg, with a smile; 'or may be you wouldn't have come into the shop just now, and I should have got only tenpence.  I suppose that's taking care of me, isn't it?' 'I don't know,' said Kitty.  'Only let me do that for you when you want it done again.' It was not very long before it wanted to be done again; and then Meg by daylight went through the contents of the box, choosing out those things which could best be spared, but leaving Robin's and baby's fine clothes to the last.  She clung to these with a strong desire to save them, lest it should happen that her father came home too poor to redeem them.  The packet of money, tied up and sealed, fell at last to the bottom of the almost empty box, and rolled noisily about whenever it was moved, but no thought of taking any of it entered into Meg's head.  She was almost afraid of looking at it herself, lest the secret of it being there should get known in Angel Court; and whenever she mentioned it in her prayers, which she did every night, asking God to take care of it, she did not even whisper the words, much less speak them aloud, as she did her other requests, but she spoke inwardly only, for fear lest the very walls themselves should hear her.  No one came near her attic, except Kitty, and she kept her promise faithfully. Since the four bearers had carried away her mother's coffin, and since the night Kitty came out of jail, the night of Robin's birthday, no stranger's foot had crossed the door-sill.
