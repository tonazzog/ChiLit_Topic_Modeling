" Matilda’s idea, that their having a governess was a point determined on, proved more correct than her hasty conclusions generally did. Mr. Howard had been for some time aware that the mode of life which he must pursue in England would prevent him giving that undivided attention to Leila which his island home had afforded him, and which every day was becoming more necessary in the formation of her inquiring mind and impetuous character. He felt that Nurse, with all her fond affection, in her attempts to rule, was only fostering in his child a spirit of opposition and self-will; and that Leila was beginning to think in many things she knew better than Nurse, and that she did right to reject counsel, which, though always well intended, was often not judiciously given. Though resolved not to yield to the feeling, he had been too long accustomed to the exclusive society of his child, not to be aware that there would be many occasions in which the presence of a third person would prove irksome to him, and it was therefore with real gratitude that he listened to Mrs. Stanley’s proposal, that the intended governess should reside under their roof, yet still have the joint charge of the cousins. “The distance was so short,” she observed, “not two miles, it would only be healthful exercise for Leila to walk when the day was fine, and in bad weather she could easily be sent to them in the carriage. She should take care that Leila was always at home to dine with her papa when he was alone, and to read and sing to him in the evenings, as she had been accustomed to do.” When Mr. Howard sent for Leila next day to communicate this intelligence, she entered his room with an unusually grave expression; the dreaded idea of a governess had been haunting her imagination the whole morning, and gaining strength every minute. She advanced slowly, and taking her papa’s hand in hers, she looked up anxiously into his eyes:--“Is it a governess, papa?” she said, “is it? Oh, tell me quick.” “My dear child,” Mr. Howard answered, as he stooped down and kissed her forehead, “my dear, dear child, what is all this? Why do you look at me in this piteous manner? Indeed you must not agitate yourself in this way; you must not let your imagination get the better of you; it certainly was on this subject I wished to talk to you; but is the idea of a governess so very frightful to you?” “No, papa; perhaps she is not frightful, but you know I never saw one; perhaps she is like other ladies, but then you know she will be always there, always sticking to me; Matilda said something which made me know that; always _sticking_, papa; and then I shall never be alone with you. No more nice chats with your little friend.” Her voice failed, she could not continue. Mr. Howard looked at her anxiously; “Leila, my dear child, you distress me; if you allow yourself to get into this way of anticipating imaginary evils, you will enervate your mind, and unfit yourself to bear as you ought to do the real trials of life; remember who says, ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’ Now listen to me; I can see that Matilda has made you aware that you are to have a governess, and all the morning you have probably been working yourself up with the idea of suffering from what I trust may prove the greatest blessing to you. I cannot now devote my mornings to you as I did in the island; I must frequently be absent, and you are now of an age to require superior instruction to that of your faithful and affectionate nurse; but you will still be my little friend; in the evenings you will sing and read to me as you used to do, and we shall always dine together.” Leila’s face brightened. “O, what a comfort!” she exclaimed: then added, “but I don’t know that I shall be quite comfortable. My governess won’t like dining by herself; she will be melancholy.” “Now, dear child, you are again running on before the point, though I am glad that now it is that you are anxious for your governess’ comfort: but she is not to be exclusively your governess, Leila, and she is not to reside at Woodlands. Your aunt has most kindly proposed that you should spend the mornings with your cousins, and be educated with them. We are to breakfast together early as we used to do; when fine, you are to walk there immediately after breakfast, or be sent in the carriage when the weather is bad; and by five o’clock you are to be home to dine with your papa. I give you a general invitation to dinner, Miss Leila Howard, and pray give me a favourable answer.” “Papa, papa, how delightful you are to me,” Leila exclaimed; “all my fears, all my sorrows; where are they? You are like the sun to me, papa; the sun chasing away the clouds, and now there is nothing but the blue sky and my beautiful governess.” Mr. Howard smiled; “And who told you she was to be beautiful?” he inquired. “Nobody, papa; but I think she will be, and I am sure I shall like her so much.” “I hope indeed that you will like her, my love; for if your aunt succeeds in the application she is about to make, your governess is likely to prove a very estimable person; but I don’t suppose she ever was beautiful, and she can’t be very young now.” Leila’s countenance fell. “As old as the hills, I reckon,” she ejaculated, in a very low voice. But her papa caught the words: “‘As old as the hills, I _reckon_,’” he repeated; “Leila, from whom have you caught up that phrase?” “From Peggy Dobie,” she replied. “From Peggy Dobie; but, my love, have I not told you that I do not wish you to acquire Peggy Dobie’s mode of expressing yourself? I shall regret my promise of allowing Peggy to remove to Woodlands, if you are to adopt her phrases, and try to imitate her mode of speaking.” “But, papa, I promise you I will not, and I dare say our governess would not like me to speak in that way either. I hope she will come to us very soon; how soon do you think, papa? in a few days?--our governess, I mean. I know Peggy Dobie cannot be here so soon, or my pets either: how delightful it will be when they all arrive, what a world of happiness it will be then!” “My dear Leila, I have already told you that I hope this lady, if we succeed in engaging her, may prove a real blessing and advantage to you; but you must not allow your imagination to run away with you in this way, or suppose that you are immediately to find her in every way delightful; she is a person who has experienced severe trials; her husband lost a large fortune by the failure of a bank with which he was connected; he died soon after, leaving her and one little girl totally unprovided for. Her sister has taken this little girl to be educated with her own children, and Mrs. Roberts has for some time past been looking out for a situation as governess. Your aunt has a high idea of her principles, and was much struck by the truly Christian way in which she has borne up under her misfortunes; and having resided several years abroad, she speaks both French and Italian with facility, and is besides an excellent musician. All this makes her a most desirable person, but the sorrows she has gone through may probably make her graver than you may at first think agreeable; and you must remember, besides, that a governess has an arduous task to perform, and many difficulties to combat.” “What difficulties, papa?” “The difficulties, my love, of having three little girls to correct, to control, and to instruct.” ",idea governess point determine prove correct hasty conclusion time aware mode life pursue prevent give undivided attention island home afford day become necessary formation inquire mind impetuous character feel fond affection attempt rule foster child spirit opposition self will begin many thing right reject counsel intend give resolve yield feeling long accustom exclusive society child aware many occasion presence third person prove irksome real gratitude listen proposal intend governess reside roof joint charge cousin distance short observe mile healthful exercise walk day fine bad weather send carriage care home dine papa alone read sing evening accustom send next day communicate intelligence enter room grave expression dread idea governess haunting imagination whole morning gain strength minute advance papa hand eye governess papa dear child answer stoop kiss forehead dear dear child piteous manner agitate way let imagination subject wish talk idea governess frightful papa frightful other lady stick papa alone nice chat friend voice fail continue dear child distress allow way anticipate imaginary evil enervate mind unfit bear real trial life remember sufficient day evil listen aware governess morning work idea suffer trust prove great blessing devote morning island absent age require superior instruction faithful affectionate nurse friend evening sing read use dine face brighten comfort exclaim add comfortable governess like dining melancholy dear child run point glad anxious governess comfort governess reside aunt propose spend morning cousin educate breakfast use fine walk breakfast send carriage weather bad dine papa give general invitation dinner pray give favourable answer delightful exclaim fear sorrow sun papa sun chase cloud blue sky beautiful governess smile beautiful inquire papa sure like hope like love aunt succeed application about governess likely prove estimable person suppose beautiful young countenance fall old hill reckon ejaculate low voice papa catch word old hill repeat catch phrase reply love wish acquire mode express regret promise allow remove adopt phrase try imitate mode speak promise governess like speak way hope few day governess mean pet delightful arrive world happiness dear hope lady succeed engage prove real blessing advantage allow imagination run way suppose find way delightful person experience severe trial husband lose large fortune failure bank connect die leave girl unprovide sister girl educate own child time situation governess aunt high idea principle strike christian way borne misfortune reside several year speak french facility excellent musician desirable person sorrow graver agreeable remember governess arduous task perform many difficulty combat difficulty papa difficulty love girl correct control instruct
