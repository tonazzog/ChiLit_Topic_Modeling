"CHAPTER XXXI. PRISSY'S PICNIC.  But just at this moment an important personage stalked through the great broken-down doorway by which kings and princes most magnificent had once entered the ancient Castle of the Lorraines. He stood a moment or two on the threshold behind Nosie Cuthbertson, silently contemplating his courageous doings. Presently a little stifled cry escaped from Prissy, caused by one of Nosie's refinements in torture, which consisted in separating her fingers and pulling two in one direction and two in the other. Nosie was a youth of parts and promise, who had already proceeded some distance on his way to the gallows. But the Important Personage, who was no other than Nipper Donnan himself, did not long remain quiescent. He advanced suddenly, seized Nosie Cuthbertson by the scruff of the neck, kicked him several times severely, tweaked his ear till it looked as if it had been constructed of the best india-rubber, and then ended by tumbling him into the moat, where he disappeared as noiselessly as if he had fallen into green syrup. ""Now, what's all this?"" cried the lordly Nipper, whose doings among his own no man dared to question, for reasons connected with health. At the first sight of him Bob Hetherington had quietly shouldered his musket, and begun pacing up and down with his nose in the air, as if he had never so much as dreamed of going near Prissy's basket. ""What's all this, I say--you?"" demanded his captain. ""I don't know any bloomin' thing about it----"" began Bob, with whom ignorance, if not honesty, was certainly the best policy. ""Salute!"" roared his officer; ""don't you know enough to salute when you speak to me? Want to get knocked endways?"" Sulkily Bob Hetherington obeyed. ""Well?"" said Nipper Donnan, somewhat appeased by the appearance of Nosie Cuthbertson as he scrambled up the bank, with the green scum of duckweed clinging all over him. He was shaking his head and muttering anathemas, declaring what his father would do to Nipper Donnan, when within his heart he knew that first of all something very painful would be done to himself by that able-bodied relative as soon as ever he showed face at home. ""This girl she come to the drawbridge and hollered--that's all I know!"" said the sentry, disassociating himself from any trouble as completely as possible. Bob felt that under the circumstances it was very distinctly folly to be wise. ""I don't know what she hollered, but Nosie he runs an' begins twisting her arm, and then the girl she begins to holler again!"" ""I didn't mean to,"" said Prissy tremulously, ""but he _was_ hurting so dreadfully."" ""Come here, you!"" shouted Nipper to the retiring Nosie. Whereupon that young gentleman, hearing the dreadful voice of his chief officer, and being at the time on the right side of the moat, did not pause to respond, but promptly took to his heels in the direction of the town. ""Run after him and bring him back, two of you fellows! Don't dare come back without him!"" cried Nipper, and at his word two big boys detached themselves from the doorposts in which the guard was kept, and dashed after the deserter. ""Oh, don't hurt him--perhaps he didn't mean it!"" cried the universally sympathetic Prissy. ""He didn't hurt me much after all, and it is quite better now anyway."" Nipper Donnan could, as we know, be as cruel as anybody, but he liked to keep both the theory and practice of terror in his own hands. Besides, some possible far-off fragrance from another life stirred in him when he saw the slim girlish figure of Prissy Smith, clad all in white with a large sun-bonnet edged with pale green, standing on the bank and appealing to him with eyes different from any he had ever seen. He wanted, he knew not why, to kick Nosie Cuthbertson--kick him much harder than he had done before he saw whom he was tormenting. He had never particularly noticed any one's eyes before. He had thought vaguely that every one had the same kind of eyes. [""THE RETURN OF THE TWO SWIFT FOOTMEN.""] ""Well, what do you want?"" he said gruffly. For with Nipper and his class emotion or shamefacedness of any kind always in the first instance produces additional dourness. Prissy smiled upon him--a glad, confident smile. She was the daughter of one war chief, the sister of another, and she knew that it is always best and simplest to treat only with principals. ""You know that I didn't come to spy or find out anything, don't you?"" she said; ""only I was so sorry to think you were fighting with each other, when the Bible tells us to love one another. Why can't we all be nice together? I'm sure Hugh John would if you would----"" ""Gammon--this is our castle,"" said Nipper Donnan sullenly, ""my father he says so. Everybody says so. Your father has no right to it."" ""Well, but--"" replied Prissy, with woman's gentle wit avoiding all discussion of the bone of contention, ""I'm sure you would let us come here and have picnics and things. And you could come too, and play at soldiers and marching and drills--all without fighting to hurt."" ""Fighting is the best fun!"" snarled Nipper; ""besides, 'twasn't us that begun it."" ""Then,"" answered Prissy, ""wouldn't it be all the nicer of you if you were to stop first?"" But this Nipper Donnan could not be expected to understand. A diversion was caused at this moment by the return of the two swift footmen, with the culprit Nosie between them, doing the frog's march, and having his own experiences as to what arm-twisting meant. ""Cast him into the deepest dungeon beneath the castle moat!"" thundered the brigand chief. ""Can't,"" said the elder of the two captors, one Joe Craig, the son of the Carlisle carrier; ""can't--we couldn't get him out again if we did!"" ""Well then,""--returned the great chief, swiftly deciding upon an alternative plan, as if he had thought about it from the first, ""chuck him down anywhere on the stones, and get Fat Sandy to sit on him."" [""HYDRAULIC PRESSURE.""] Joe Craig obediently saluted, and presently sundry moans and sounds of exhausted breath indicated that Nosie Cuthbertson was being subjected to hydraulic pressure by the unseen tormentor whom Nipper Donnan had called Fat Sandy. Prissy felt that nothing she could say would for the present lessen Master Nosie's griefs, so she went on to accomplish her purpose by other means. ""If you please, Mr. Captain,"" she said politely, ""I thought you would like to taste our nice sheep's-head-pie. Janet makes it all out of her own head. Besides, there are some dee-licious fruits which I have brought you; and if you will let me come in, I will make you some lovely tea?"" Nipper Donnan considered, and at last shook his head. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""'tisn't regular. How do we know that you aren't a spy?"" ""You could bind my eyes with a napkin, and----"" ""That's the thing!"" cried several of Nipper's followers, who scented something to eat, and who knew that the commissariat was the weak point in the defences of the Castle of Windy Standard under the Consulship of Donnan. ""Well,"" said the chief, ""that's according to rule. Here, Timothy Tracy, tell us if that is all right."" Whereupon uprose Timothy Tracy, a long lank boy with yellowish hair and dull lack-lustre eyes, out of a niche in the wall and unfolded a number of ""The Wild Boys of New York."" He rustled the flaccid, ill-conditioned leaves and found the place.

"""'Then Bendigo Bill went to the gateway of the stockade to interview the emissary of the besiegers. With keen unerring eyes he examined his credentials, and finding them correct, he took from the breast of his fringed buckskin hunting-dress a handkerchief of fine Indian silk, and with it he swathed the eyes of the ambassador. Then taking the envoy by the hand he led him past the impregnable defences of the Comanche Cowboys into the presence of their haughty chief, who was seated with the fair Luluja beside him, holding her delicate hand, and inhaling the fragrance of a choice Havanna cigar through his noble aquiline nose.' ""That's all it says,"" said Timothy Tracy, succinctly, and straightway curled himself up again to resume his own story at the place where he had left it off. ""Well, that's all pretty straight and easy. Nobody can say fairer nor that,"" meditated Bob Hetherington. ""Shut up!"" said his chief; ""who asked for your oar? I'll knock the bloomin' nut off you if you don't watch out. Blindfold the emissary of the enemy, and bring her before me into the inner court."" And with this peremptory command, Nipper Donnan disappeared. But the order was more easily given than obeyed. For not only could the entire array of the Comanche Cowboys produce nothing even distantly resembling Indian silk (which at any rate was a counsel of perfection), but what was worse, their pockets were equally destitute of common domestic linen. Indeed the proceedings would have fallen through at this point had not the ambassadress offered her own. This was knotted round her brows by Joe Craig, with the best intentions in the world. Immediately after completing the arrangement, he stepped in front of Prissy and said, thrusting his fist below her nose, ""Tell me if you see anything--mind, true as 'Hope-you-may-Die!'"" ""I do see something, something very dirty,"" said Prissy, ""but I can't quite tell what it is."" ""She _can_ see, boys,"" cried Joe indignantly, ""it's my hand."" Every boy recognised the description, and the handkerchief was once more adjusted with greater care and precision than before, so that it was only by the sense of smell that Prissy could judge of the proximity of Joe Craig's fingers. ""Please let me carry my basket myself--I've got my best china tea-service in it--and then I will be sure that it won't get broken."" A licentious soldiery was about to object, but a stern command issued unexpectedly from one of the arrow-slits through which their chief had been on the watch. ""Give the girl the basket! Do you hear--you?"" And in this manner Prissy entered the castle, guarded on either side by soldiers with fixed (wooden) bayonets. And at the inner and outer ports, the convoy was halted and asked for the pass-word. ""_Death!_"" cried Joe Craig, at the pitch of his voice. ""_Vengeance!_"" replied the sentry. ""Pass, '_Death_'!"" At last Prissy felt the grass beneath her feet, and the handkerchief being slipped from her eyes, she found herself within the courtyard of the castle. The captain of the band sat before her with a red sash tied tightly about his waist. By his side swung a butcher's steel, almost as long and twice as dangerous as a sword. Prissy began her mission at once, to allow Captain Donnan no time to order her out again, or to put her into a dungeon, as he had done with Hugh John. ""I think we had better have tea first,"" she said. ""Have you got a match-box?"" She could not have taken a better line. Nipper Donnan stepped down from his high horse at once. He put his hand into his pocket. ""I have only fusees,"" he said grandly, ""but perhaps they will do. You see regular smokers never use anything else."" ""Oh yes, they will do perfectly,"" returned Prissy sweetly, ""it is just to light the spirit-lamp. See how nicely it fits in. Isn't it a beauty? I got that from father on my birthday. Wasn't it nice of him?"" Nipper Donnan grunted. He never found any marked difference between his birthday and any other day. Nevertheless he stood by and assisted at the making of the tea, a process which interested him greatly. ""I shall need some more fresh spring water for so many cups,"" said Prissy, ""I only brought the full of the kettle with me."" The chief slightly waved a haughty hand, which instantly impelled Joe Craig forward as if moved by a spring. ""Bring some fresh water from the well!"" he commanded. Joe Craig took the tin dipper, and was marching off. Prissy looked distressed. ""What is it?"" said the robber chief. Now Prissy did not want to be rude, but she had her feelings. ""Oh, please, Mr. Captain,"" she said, ""his hands--I think he has perhaps been working----"" Nipper Donnan had no fine scruples, but he respected them in such an unknown quantity as this dainty little lady with the green trimmed sun-bonnet and the widely-opened eyes. ""Tracy, fetch the water, you lazy jaundiced toad!"" he commanded. The sallow student rose unwillingly, and moved off with his face still bent upon the thrilling pages of ""The Wild Boys of New York,"" which he held folded small in his hand for convenience of perusal. Presently the tea being made, the white cloth was laid on the grass, and the entire company of the Smoutchy Boys crowded about, always excepting the sentinels at the east and west doors, who being on duty could not immediately participate. The sheep's-head-pie, the bread, the butter, the fruits were all set out in order, and the whole presented such an appearance as the inside of the Castle of Windy Standard had never seen through all its generations. Prissy conducted herself precisely as if she had been dispensing afternoon tea to callers in the drawing-room, as, since her last birthday, her father had occasionally permitted her to do. ""Do you take sugar?"" she asked, delicately poising a piece in the dolls' sugar-tongs, and smiling her most politefully conventional smile at Nipper Donnan. The brigand chief had never been asked such a question before, and had no answer of the usual kind at hand. But he replied for all that. ""_Rather!_"" he cried in a burst, ""if the grocer's not lookin'!"" ""I mean in your tea! Do you take sugar in your tea?"" Prissy was still smiling. Nipper appeared to acquiesce. Two knobs of sugar were dropped in. The whipped cream out of the wide-mouthed bottle was spooned delicately on the top, and with a yet more charming smile the cup was passed to him. He held it between his finger and thumb, as an inquiring naturalist holds a rare beetle. Then he put it down on a low fragment of wall and looked at it.
