"CHAPTER XI. REAPING THE WHIRLWIND      ""For alas! alas! with me       The light of life is o'er;      No more--no more--no more      (Such language holds the solemn sea       To the sands upon the shore)      Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,       Or the stricken eagle soar!"" The landlord of the Jolly Herring had observed during his visits to Eric, that at mid-day the studies were usually deserted, and the doors for the most part left unlocked. He very soon determined to make use of this knowledge for his own purposes, and as he was well acquainted with the building (in which for a short time he had been a servant), he laid his plans without the least dread of discovery. There was a back entrance into Roslyn school behind the chapel, and it could be reached by a path through the fields without any chance of being seen, if a person set warily to work and watched his opportunity. By this path Billy came, two days after his last visit, and walked straight up the great staircase, armed with the excuse of business with Eric in case any one met or questioned him. But no one was about, since between twelve and one the boys were pretty sure to be amusing themselves out of doors; and after glancing into each of the studies, Billy finally settled on searching Montagu's (which was the neatest and best furnished), to see what he could get. The very first thing which caught his experienced eye was the cricket-fund box, with the key temptingly in the lock, just where Eric had left it when the sounds of some one coming had startled him. In a moment Billy had made a descent on the promising-looking booty, and opening his treasure, saw, with lively feelings of gratification, the unexpected store of silver and gold. This he instantly transferred to his own pocket, and then replacing the box where he had found it, decamped with the spoil unseen, leaving the study in all other respects exactly as he had found it. Meanwhile the unhappy Eric was tossed and agitated with apprehension and suspense. Unable to endure his misery in loneliness, he had made several boys to a greater or less degree participators in the knowledge of his difficult position, and in the sympathy which his danger excited, the general nature of his dilemma with Billy (though not its special circumstances) was soon known through the school. At the very time when the money was being stolen, Eric was sitting with Wildney and Graham under the ruin by the shore, and the sorrow which lay at his heart was sadly visible in the anxious expression of his face, and the deep dejection of his attitude and manner. The other two were trying to console him. They suggested every possible topic of hope; but it was too plain that there was nothing to be said, and that Eric had real cause to fear the worst. Yet though their arguments were futile, he keenly felt the genuineness of their affection, and it brought a little alleviation to his heavy mood. ""Well, well; at least _do_ hope the best, Eric,"" said Graham. ""Yes!"" urged Wildney; ""only think, dear old fellow, what lots of worse scrapes we've been in before, and how we've always managed to get out of them somehow."" ""No, my boy; not worse scrapes,"" answered Eric. ""Depend upon it this is the last for me; I shall not have the chance of getting into another at _Roslyn_, anyhow."" ""Poor Eric! what shall I do if you leave?"" said Wildney, putting his arm round Eric's neck. ""Besides it's all my fault, hang it, that you got into this cursed row.""      ""'The curse is come upon, me, cried      The Lady of Shallott,' ""those words keep ringing in my ears,"" murmured Eric. ""Well, Eric, if _you_ are sent away, I know I shall get my father to take me too, and then we'll join each other somewhere. Come, cheer up, old boy--being sent isn't such a very frightful thing after all."" ""No"" said Graham; ""and besides, the bagging of the pigeons was only a lark, when one comes to think of it. It wasn't like stealing, you know; _that_'d be quite a different thing."" Eric winced visibly at this remark, but his companions did not notice it. ""Ah,"" thought he, ""there's _one_ passage of my life which I never shall be able to reveal to any human soul."" ""Come now, Eric,"" said Wildney, ""I've got something to propose. You shall play cricket to-day; you haven't played for an age, and it's high time you should. If you don't you'll go mooning about the shore all day, and that'll never do, for you'll come back glummer than ever."" ""No!"" said Eric, with a heavy sigh, as the image of Vernon instantly passed through his mind; ""no more cricket for me."" ""Nay, but you _must_ play to-day. Come, you shan't say no. You won't say no to me, will you, dear old fellow?"" And Wildney looked up to him with that pleasant smile, and the merry light in his dark eyes, which had always been so charming to Eric's fancy. ""There's no refusing you,"" said Eric with the ghost of a laugh, as he boxed Wildney's ears. ""O you dear little rogue, Charlie, I wish I were you."" ""Pooh! pooh! now you shan't get sentimental again. As if you wern't fifty times better than me every way. I'm sure I don't know how I shall ever love you enough, Eric,"" he added more seriously, ""for all your kindness to me."" ""I'm so glad you're going to play, though,"" said Graham; ""and so will everybody be; and I'm certain it'll be good for you. The game will divert your thoughts."" So that afternoon Eric, for the first time since Verny's death, played with the first eleven, of which he had been captain. The school cheered him vigorously as he appeared again on the field, and the sound lighted up his countenance with some gleam of its old joyousness. When one looked at him that day with his straw hat on and its neat light-blue ribbon, and the cricket dress (a pink jersey and leather belt, with a silver clasp in front), showing off his well-built and graceful figure, one little thought what an agony was gnawing like a serpent at his heart. But that day, poor boy, in the excitement of the game he half forgot it himself, and more and more as the game went on. The other side, headed by Montagu, went in first, and Eric caught out two, and bowled several. Montagu was the only one who stayed in long, and when at last Eric sent his middle wicket flying with a magnificent ball, the shouts of ""well bowled! well bowled _indeed_,"" were universal. ""Just listen to that, Eric,"" said Montagu; ""why, you're out-doing every body to-day, yourself included, and taking us by storm."" ""Wait till you see me come out for a duck,"" said Eric laughing. ""Not you. You're too much in luck to come out with a duck,"" answered Montagu. ""You see I've already become the Homer of your triumphs, and vaticinate in rhyme."" And now it was Eric's turn to go in. It was long since he had stood before the wicket, but now he was there, looking like a beautiful picture as the sunlight streamed over him, and made his fair hair shine like gold. In the triumph of success his sorrows were flung to the winds, and his blue eyes sparkled with interest and joy.

"He contented himself with blocking Duncan's balls until his eye was in; but then, acquiring confidence, he sent them flying right and left. His score rapidly mounted, and there seemed no chance of getting him out, so that there was every probability of his carrying out his bat. ""Oh, _well_ hit! _well_ hit! A three'r for Eric,"" cried Wildney to the scorer; and he began to clap his hands and dance about with excitement at his friend's success. ""Oh, well hit! well hit in--deed!"" shouted all the lookers on, as Eric caught the next ball half-volley, and sent it whizzing over the hedge, getting a sixer by the hit. At the next ball they heard a great crack, and he got no run, for the handle of his bat broke right off. ""How unlucky!"" he said, flinging down the handle with vexation. ""I believe this was our best bat."" ""Oh, never mind,"" said Montagu; ""we can soon get another; we've got lots of money in the box."" What had come over Eric? if there had been a sudden breath of poison in the atmosphere he could hardly have been more affected than he was by Montagu's simple remark. Montagu could not help noticing it, but at the time merely attributed it to some unknown gust of feeling, and made no comment. But Eric, hastily borrowing another bat, took his place again quite tamely; he was trembling, and at the very next ball, he spooned a miserable catch into Graham's hand, and the shout of triumph from the other side proclaimed that his innings was over. He walked dejectedly to the pavilion for his coat, and the boys, who were seated in crowds about it, received him, of course, after his brilliant score, with loud and continued plaudits. But the light had died away from his face and figure, and he never raised his eyes from the ground. ""Modest Eric!"" said Wildney chaffingly, ""you don't acknowledge your honors."" Eric dropped his bat in the corner, put his coat across his arm, and walked away. As he passed Wildney, he stooped down and whispered again in a low voice--      ""'The curse has come upon me, cried      The Lady of Shallott.'"" ""Hush, Eric, nonsense,"" whispered Wildney; ""you're not going away,"" he continued aloud, as Eric turned towards the school. ""Why, there are only two more to go in!"" ""Yes, thank you, I must go."" ""Oh, then, I'll come too."" Wildney at once joined his friend. ""There's nothing more the matter, is there?"" he asked anxiously, when they were out of hearing of the rest. ""God only knows."" ""Well, let's change the subject. You've being playing brilliantly, old fellow."" ""I should just think so, only you got out in rather a stupid way."" ""Ah well! it matters very little."" Just at this moment one of the servants handed Eric a kind note from Mrs. Rowlands, with whom he was a very great favorite, asking him to tea that night. He was not very surprised, for he had been several times lately, and the sweet womanly kindness which she always showed him caused him the greatest pleasure. Besides, she had known his mother. ""Upon my word, honors _are_ being showered on you!"" said Wildney. ""First to get _the_ score of the season at cricket, and bowl out about half the other side, and then go to tea with the head-master. Upon my word! Why any of us poor wretches would give our two ears for such distinctions. Talk of curse indeed! Fiddlestick end!"" But Eric's sorrow lay too deep for chaff, and only answering with a sigh, he went to dress for tea. Just before tea-time Duncan, and Montagu strolled in together. ""How splendidly Eric played,"" said Duncan. ""Yes, indeed. I'm so glad. By the bye, I must see about getting a new bat. I don't know exactly how much money we've got, but I know there's plenty. Let's come and see."" They entered his study, and he looked about everywhere for the key. ""Hallo,"" he said, ""I'm nearly sure I left it in the corner of this drawer, under some other things; but it isn't there now. What can have become of it?"" ""Where's the box?"" said Duncan; ""let's see if any of my keys will fit it. Hallo! why _you're_ a nice treasurer, Monty! here's the key _in_ the box!"" ""No, is it though?"" asked Montagu, looking serious. ""Here, give it me; I hope nobody's been meddling with it."" He opened it quickly, and stood in dumb and blank amazement to see it empty. ""Phew-w-w-w!"" Montagu gave a long whistle. ""By Jove!"" was Duncan's only comment. The boys looked at each other, but neither dared to express what was in his thoughts. ""A bad, bad business! what's to be done, Monty?"" ""I'll rush straight down to tea, and ask the fellows about it. Would you mind requesting Rose not to come in for five minutes? Tell him there's a row."" He ran down stairs hastily and entered the tea-room, where the boys were talking in high spirits about the match, and liberally praising Eric's play. ""I've got something unpleasant to say,"" he announced, raising his voice. ""Hush! hush! hush! what's the row?"" asked half a dozen at once. ""The whole of the cricket money, some six pounds at least, has vanished from the box in my study!"" For an instant the whole room was silent; Wildney and Graham interchanged anxious glances. ""Does any fellow know anything about this?"" All, or most, had a vague suspicion, but no one spoke. ""Where is Williams?"" asked one of the sixth form casually. ""He's taking tea with the Doctor,"" said Wildney. Mr. Rose came in, and there was no opportunity for more to be said, except in confidential whispers. Duncan went up with Owen and Montagu to their study. ""What's to be done?"" was the general question. ""I think we've all had a lesson once before not to suspect too hastily. Still, in a matter like this,"" said Montagu, ""one _must_ take notice of apparent cues."" ""I know what you're thinking of, Monty,"" said Duncan. ""Well, then, did you hear anything when you and I surprised Eric suddenly two days ago?"" ""I heard some one moving about in your study, as I thought."" ""I heard more--though at the time it didn't strike me particularly. I distinctly heard the jingle of money."" ""Well, it's no good counting up suspicious circumstances; we must _ask_ him about it, and act accordingly.' ""Will he come up to the studies again to-night?"" ""I think not,"" said Owen; ""I notice he generally goes straight to bed after he has been out to tea; that's to say, directly after prayers."" The three sat there till prayer-time taciturn and thoughtful. Their books were open, but they did little work, and it was evident that Montagu was filled with the most touching grief. During the evening he drew out a little likeness which Eric had given him, and looked at it long and earnestly. ""Is it possible?"" he thought. ""Oh Eric! can that face be the face of a thief?"" The prayer-bell dispelled his reverie. Eric entered with the Rowlands, and sat in his accustomed place. He had spent a pleasant, quiet evening, and, little knowing what had happened, felt far more cheerful and hopeful than he had done before, although he was still ignorant how to escape the difficulty which threatened him. He couldn't help observing that as he entered he was the object of general attention; but he attributed it either to his playing that day, or to the circumstances in which he was placed by Billy's treachery, of which he knew that many boys were now aware. But when prayers were over, and he saw that every one shunned him, or looked and spoke in the coldest manner, his most terrible fears revived.

"He went off to his dormitory, and began to undress. As he sat half abstracted on his bed doing nothing Montagu and Duncan entered, and he started to see them, for they were evidently the bearers of some serious intelligence. ""Eric,"" said Duncan, ""do you know that some one has stolen all the cricket money?"" ""Stolen--what--_all_?"" he cried, leaping up as if he had been shot. ""Oh, what new retribution is this?"" and he hid his face, which had turned ashy pale, in his hands. ""To cut matters short, Eric, do you know anything about it?"" ""If it is all gone, it is not I who stole it,"" he said, not lifting his head. ""Do you know anything about it?"" ""No!"" he sobbed convulsively. ""No, no, no! Yet stop; don't let me add a lie.... Let me think. No, Duncan!"" he said, looking up, ""I do _not_ know who stole it."" They stood silent, and the tears were stealing down Montagu's averted face. ""O Duncan, Monty, be merciful, be merciful,"" said Eric. ""Don't _yet_ condemn me. _I_ am guilty, not of _this_, but of something as bad. I admit I was tempted; but if the money really is all gone, it is _not_ I who am the thief."" ""You must know, Eric, that the suspicion against you is very strong, and rests on some definite facts."" ""Yes, I know it must. Yet, oh, do be merciful, and don't yet condemn me. I have denied it. Am I a liar Monty? Oh Monty, Monty, believe me in this."" But the boys still stood silent. ""Well, then,"" he said, ""I will tell you all. But I can only tell it to you, Monty. Duncan, indeed you mustn't be angry; you are my friend, but not so much as Monty. I can tell him, and him only."" Duncan left the room, and Montagu sat down beside Eric on the bed, and put his arm round him to support him, for he shook violently. There, with deep and wild emotion, and many interruptions of passionate silence, Eric told to Montagu his miserable tale. ""I am the most wretched fellow living,"" he said; ""there must be some fiend that hates me, and drives me to ruin. But let it all come; I care nothing, nothing, what happens to me now. Only, dear, dear Monty, forgive me, and love me still."" ""O Eric, it is not for one like me to talk of forgiveness; you were sorely tempted. Yet God will forgive you if you ask him. Won't you pray to him to-night? I love you, Eric, still, with all my heart, and do you think God can be less kind than man? And _I_, too, will pray for you, Eric. Good night, and God bless you"" He gently disengaged himself--for Eric clung to him, and seemed unwilling to lose sight of him--and a moment after he was gone. Eric felt terribly alone. He knelt down and tried to pray, but somehow it didn't seem as if the prayer came from his heart, and his thoughts began instantly to wander far away. Still he knelt--knelt even until his candle had gone out, and he had nearly fallen asleep, thought-wearied, on his knees. And then he got into bed still dressed. He had been making up his mind that he could bear it no longer, and would run away to sea that night. He waited till eleven, when Dr. Rowlands took his rounds. The Doctor had been told all the circumstances of suspicion, and they amounted in his mind to certainty. It made him very sad, and he stopped to look at the boy from whom he had parted on such friendly terms so short a time before. Eric did not pretend to be asleep, but opened his eyes, and looked at the head-master. Very sorrowfully Dr. Rowlands shook his head, and went away. Eric never saw him again. The moment he was gone Eric got up. He meant to go to his study, collect the few presents, which were his dearest mementos of Russell, Wildney, and his other friends--above all, Vernon's likeness--and then make his escape from the building, using for the last time the broken pane and loosened bar in the corridor, with which past temptations had made him so familiar. He turned the handle of the door and pushed, but it did not yield. Half contemplating the possibility of such an intention on Eric's part, Dr. Rowlands had locked it behind him when he went out. ""Ha!"" thought the boy, ""then he, too, knows and suspects. Never mind. I must give up my treasures--yes, even poor Verny's picture; perhaps it is best I should, for I'm only disgracing his noble memory. But they shan't prevent me from running away."" Once more he deliberated. Yes, there could be no doubt about the decision. He _could_, not endure another public expulsion, or even another birching; he _could_ not endure the cold faces of even his best friends. No, no! he _could_ not face the horrible phantom of detection, and exposure, and shame. Escape he must. After using all his strength in long-continued efforts, he succeeded in loosening the bar of his bed-room window. He then took his two sheets, tied them together in a firm knot, wound one end tightly round the remaining bar, and let the other fall down the side of the building. He took one more glance round his little room, and then let himself down by the sheet, hand under hand, until he could drop to the ground. Once safe, he ran towards Starhaven as fast as he could, and felt as if he were flying for his life. But when he got to the end of the playground he could not help stopping to take one more longing, lingering look at the scenes he was leaving for ever. It was a chilly and overclouded night, and by the gleams of struggling moonlight, he saw the whole buildings standing out black in the night air. The past lay behind him like a painting. Many and many unhappy or guilty hours had he spent in that home, and yet those last four years had not gone by without their own wealth of life and joy. He remembered how he had first walked across that playground, hand in hand with his father, a little boy of twelve. He remembered his first troubles with Barker, and how his father had at last delivered him from the annoyances of his old enemy. He remembered how often he and Russell had sat there, looking at the sea, in pleasant talk, especially the evening when he had got his first prize and head remove in the lower fourth; and how, in the night of Russell's death, he had gazed over that playground from the sick-room window. He remembered how often he had got cheered there for his feats at cricket and football, and how often he and Upton in old days, and he and Wildney afterwards, had walked there on Sundays, arm in arm. Then the stroll to Port Island, and Barker's plot against him, and the evening at the Stack passed through his mind; and the dinner at the Jolly Herring, and, above all, Vernon's death. Oh! how awful it seemed to him now, as he looked through the darkness at the very road along which they had brought Verny's dead body. Then his thoughts turned to the theft of the pigeons, his own drunkenness, and then his last cruel, cruel experiences, and this dreadful end of the day which, for an hour or two, had seemed _so_ bright on that very spot where he stood. Could it be that this (oh, how little he had ever dreamed of it)--that this was to be the conclusion of his school days? Yes, in those rooms, of which the windows fronted him, there they lay, all his schoolfellows--Montagu, and Wildney, and Duncan, and all whom he cared for best. And there was Mr. Rose's light still burning in the library window; and he was leaving the school and those who had been with him there so long, in the dark night, by stealth, penniless and broken-hearted, with the shameful character of a thief.
