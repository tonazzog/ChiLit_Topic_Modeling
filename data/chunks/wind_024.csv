"CHAPTER XXIV. ANOTHER EARLY BIRD  HE GOT up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard. He tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed, and then went out, leaving the door open, so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once. When he got into the yard he found the stable-door just opened. “I’m the early bird, I think,” he said to himself. “I hope I shall catch the worm.” He would not ask any one to help him, fearing his project might meet with disapproval and opposition. With great difficulty, but with the help of a broken chair he brought down from his bedroom, he managed to put the harness on Diamond. If the old horse had had the least objection to the proceeding, of course he could not have done it; but even when it came to the bridle, he opened his mouth for the bit, just as if he had been taking the apple which Diamond sometimes gave him. He fastened the cheek-strap very carefully, just in the usual hole, for fear of choking his friend, or else letting the bit get amongst his teeth. It was a job to get the saddle on; but with the chair he managed it. If old Diamond had had an education in physics to equal that of the camel, he would have knelt down to let him put it on his back, but that was more than could be expected of him, and then Diamond had to creep quite under him to get hold of the girth. The collar was almost the worst part of the business; but there Diamond could help Diamond. He held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round, and then he lifted his head, and shook it on to his shoulders. The yoke was rather difficult; but when he had laid the traces over the horse’s neck, the weight was not too much for him. He got him right at last, and led him out of the stable. By this time there were several of the men watching him, but they would not interfere, they were so anxious to see how he would get over the various difficulties. They followed him as far as the stable-door, and there stood watching him again as he put the horse between the shafts, got them up one after the other into the loops, fastened the traces, the belly-band, the breeching, and the reins. Then he got his whip. The moment he mounted the box, the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success. But they would not let him go without a general inspection of the harness; and although they found it right, for not a buckle had to be shifted, they never allowed him to do it for himself again all the time his father was ill. The cheer brought his mother to the window, and there she saw her little boy setting out alone with the cab in the gray of morning. She tugged at the window, but it was stiff; and before she could open it, Diamond, who was in a great hurry, was out of the mews, and almost out of the street. She called “Diamond! Diamond!” but there was no answer except from Jack. “Never fear for him, ma’am,” said Jack. “It ‘ud be only a devil as would hurt him, and there ain’t so many o’ them as some folk ‘ud have you believe. A boy o’ Diamond’s size as can ‘arness a ‘oss t’other Diamond’s size, and put him to, right as a trivet--if he do upset the keb--‘ll fall on his feet, ma’am.” “But he won’t upset the cab, will he, Jack?” “Not he, ma’am. Leastways he won’t go for to do it.” “I know as much as that myself. What do you mean?” “I mean he’s a little likely to do it as the oldest man in the stable. How’s the gov’nor to-day, ma’am?” “A good deal better, thank you,” she answered, closing the window in some fear lest her husband should have been made anxious by the news of Diamond’s expedition. He knew pretty well, however, what his boy was capable of, and although not quite easy was less anxious than his mother. But as the evening drew on, the anxiety of both of them increased, and every sound of wheels made his father raise himself in his bed, and his mother peep out of the window. Diamond had resolved to go straight to the cab-stand where he was best known, and never to crawl for fear of getting annoyed by idlers. Before he got across Oxford Street, however, he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train, and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver. Having carried him to King’s Cross in good time, and got a good fare in return, he set off again in great spirits, and reached the stand in safety. He was the first there after all. As the men arrived they all greeted him kindly, and inquired after his father. “Ain’t you afraid of the old ‘oss running away with you?” asked one. “No, he wouldn’t run away with me,” answered Diamond. “He knows I’m getting the shillings for father. Or if he did he would only run home.” “Well, you’re a plucky one, for all your girl’s looks!” said the man; “and I wish ye luck.” “Thank you, sir,” said Diamond. “I’ll do what I can. I came to the old place, you see, because I knew you would let me have my turn here.” In the course of the day one man did try to cut him out, but he was a stranger; and the shout the rest of them raised let him see it would not do, and made him so far ashamed besides, that he went away crawling. Once, in a block, a policeman came up to him, and asked him for his number. Diamond showed him his father’s badge, saying with a smile: “Father’s ill at home, and so I came out with the cab. There’s no fear of me. I can drive. Besides, the old horse could go alone.” “Just as well, I daresay. You’re a pair of ‘em. But you are a rum ‘un for a cabby--ain’t you now?” said the policeman. “I don’t know as I ought to let you go.” “I ain’t done nothing,” said Diamond. “It’s not my fault I’m no bigger. I’m big enough for my age.” “That’s where it is,” said the man. “You ain’t fit.” “How do you know that?” asked Diamond, with his usual smile, and turning his head like a little bird. “Why, how are you to get out of this ruck now, when it begins to move?” “Just you get up on the box,” said Diamond, “and I’ll show you. There, that van’s a-moving now. Jump up.” The policeman did as Diamond told him, and was soon satisfied that the little fellow could drive. “Well,” he said, as he got down again, “I don’t know as I should be right to interfere. Good luck to you, my little man!” “Thank you, sir,” said Diamond, and drove away. In a few minutes a gentleman hailed him. “Are you the driver of this cab?” he asked. “Yes, sir” said Diamond, showing his badge, of which, he was proud. “You’re the youngest cabman I ever saw. How am I to know you won’t break all my bones?” “I would rather break all my own,” said Diamond. “But if you’re afraid, never mind me; I shall soon get another fare.” “I’ll risk it,” said the gentleman; and, opening the door himself, he jumped in. He was going a good distance, and soon found that Diamond got him over the ground well. Now when Diamond had only to go straight ahead, and had not to mind so much what he was about, his thoughts always turned to the riddle Mr. Raymond had set him; and this gentleman looked so clever that he fancied he must be able to read it for him. He had given up all hope of finding it out for himself, and he could not plague his father about it when he was ill. He had thought of the answer himself, but fancied it could not be the right one, for to see how it all fitted required some knowledge of physiology. So, when he reached the end of his journey, he got down very quickly, and with his head just looking in at the window, said, as the gentleman gathered his gloves and newspapers: ",early bird morning hear man move yard tuck brother tumble bed leave door open cry mother hear yard find stable door open early bird hope catch worm ask one help fear project meet disapproval opposition great difficulty help break chair bring bedroom manage put harness old horse least objection proceeding course bridle open mouth bit apple give fasten cheek strap usual hole fear choke friend let bit tooth job saddle chair manage old education physics equal camel knolt let put back more expect creep hold girth collar bad part business help hold head low master turn lift head shake shoulder yoke difficult lay trace horse neck weight much last lead stable time several man watch interfere anxious various difficulty follow stable door stand watch put horse shaft other loop fasten trace belly band breeching rein whip moment mount box man break hearty cheer delight success let general inspection harness find right buckle shift allow time father ill cheer bring mother window boy set cab gray morning tug window stiff open great hurry mew street call diamond answer fear devil hurt many folk believe boy size arness oss size put right trivet upset keb fall foot upset cab leastway much mean mean likely old man stable day deal thank answer close window fear husband anxious news expedition boy capable easy anxious mother evening draw anxiety increase sound wheel father raise bed mother peep window resolve cab stand crawl fear annoy idler hail man want catch train great hurry driver carry time fare return set great spirit reach stand safety first man arrive greet inquire father afraid old oss run ask run answer shilling father run plucky one girl man wish luck thank old place let turn course day man try cut stranger shout rest raise let ashamed crawl block policeman ask number show father badge smile father ill home cab fear drive old horse pair rum cabby policeman let fault big big age man fit ask usual smile turn head bird ruck begin move box show van jump policeman satisfied fellow drive right interfere luck man thank drive few minute gentleman hail driver cab ask sir show badge proud young cabman break bone break own afraid mind fare risk gentleman open door jump distance find ground mind much thought turn riddle set gentleman clever fancy able read give hope find plague father ill answer fancy right one fit require knowledge physiology reach end journey head window gentleman gather glove newspaper
