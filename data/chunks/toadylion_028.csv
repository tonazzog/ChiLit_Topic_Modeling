"CHAPTER XXVIII. THE GIPSY CAMP.  At this point a peculiar fragrance was borne to them upon the light wind, the far-blowing smell of a wood-fire, together with the odour of boiling and fragrant stew--a compound and delicious wild-wood scent, which almost created the taste by which it was to be enjoyed, as they say all good literature must. There was also another smell, less idyllic but equally characteristic--the odour of drying paint. All these came from the camp of the gipsies set up on the corner of the common lands of Windy Standard. The gipsies' wood was a barren acre of tall, ill-nurtured Scotch firs, with nothing to break their sturdy monotony of trunk right up to the spreading crown of twisted red branches and dark green spines. Beneath, the earth was covered with a carpet of dry and brown pine-needles, several inches thick, soft and silent under the feet as velvet pile. Ditches wet and dry closed in the place of sanctuary for the wandering tribes of Egypt on all sides, save only towards the high road, where a joggly, much-rutted cart track led deviously in between high banks, through which the protruding roots of the Scotch firs, knotted and scarred, were seen twisting and grappling each other like a nest of snakes. Suddenly, between the ridges of pine-trees, the pair came in sight of the camp. ""I declare,"" cried Hugh John, ""they are painting the waggons. I wish they would let me help. I can slick it on like a daisy. Now I'm telling you. Andrew Penman at the coach-works in Church Street showed me how. He says I can 'line' as well as any workman in the place. I'm going to be a coach-painter. They get bully wages, I tell you."" ""I thought you were going to be a soldier,"" commented Cissy, with the cool and inviting criticism of the model domestic lady, who is always on hand with a bucket of cold water for the enthusiasms of her men-folk. Hugh John remembered, saw his mistake, and shifted his ground all in the twinkling of an eye; for of course a man of spirit ought never to own himself in the wrong--at least to a girl. It is a bad precedent, occasionally even fatal. ""Oh yes, of course I am going to be a soldier,"" he said with the hesitation of one who stops to think what he is going to say; ""but I'm to be a coach-painter in my odd time and on holidays. Besides, officers get so little pay now-a-days, it's shameful--I heard my father say. So one must do something."" ""Oh, here's the terrier--pretty thing, I declare he quite knows me--see, Hugh John,"" cried Cissy, kneeling with delight in her eye, and taking hold of the little dog, which came bounding forward to meet her--stopping midway, however, to paw at its neck, to which the Chianti wicker-work still clung tightly round the edge of the bandage. Billy Blythe came towards them, touching his cap as he did so in a half-military manner; for had he not a brother in the county militia, who was the best fighter (with his fists) in the regiment, the pest of his colonel, but in private the particular pet of all the other officers, who were always ready to put their money on Gipsy Blythe to any amount. ""Yes, miss,"" he said; ""I done it. He's better a'ready, and as lively as a green grass-chirper. Never seed the like o' that ointment. 'Tis worth its weight in gold when ye have dogs."" A tall girl came up at this moment, dusky and lithe, her face and neck tanned to a fine healthy brown almost as dark as saddle-leather, but with a rolling black eye so full and piercing that even her complexion seemed light by comparison. She carried a back load of tinware of all sorts, and by her wearied air appeared to be returning to the encampment after a day's tramp. ""Ah, young lady and gentleman, sure I can see by your eyes that you are going to buy something from a poor girl--ribbons for the hair, or for the house some nice collanders, saucepans, fish-pans, stew-pans, patty-pans, jelly-pans----"" [""SHE CARRIED A BACK LOAD OF TINWARE.""] ""Go 'way, Lepronia Lovell,"" growled Billy; ""don't you see that this is the young lady that cured my dog?"" ""And who may the young gentleman be?"" said the girl. ""Certain I am I've seen him before somewhere at the back o' beyant."" ""Belike aye, Lepronia, tha art a clever wench, and hast got eyes in the back o' thee yead,"" said Billy, in a tone of irony. ""Do you not know the son of Master Smith o' t' Windy Standard--him as lets us bide on his land, when all the neighbours were on for nothing else but turning us off with never a rest for the soles of our feet?"" ""And what is his name?"" said the girl. ""Why, the same as his father of course, lass--what else?"" cried Billy; ""young Master Smith as ever was. Did you think it was Blythe?"" ""'Faith then, God forbid!"" said Lepronia, ""ye have lashin's of that name in them parts already. Sure it is lonesome for a poor orphan like me among so many Blythes; and good-looking young chaps some o' them too, and never a wan o' ye man enough to ask me to change my name, and go to church and be thransmogrified into a Blythe like the rest of yez!"" Some of the gipsies standing round laughed at the boldness of the girl, and Billy reddened. ""I'm not by way of takin' up with no Paddy,"" he said, and turned on his heel. ""Paddy is ut,"" cried the girl indignantly after him, ""'faith now, and it wad be tellin' ye if ye could get a daycent single woman only half as good lookin' as me, to take as much notice av the likes o' ye as to kick ye out of her road!"" She turned away, calling over her shoulder to Cissy, ""Can I tell your fortune, pretty lady?"" Quick as a flash, Cissy's answer came back. ""No, but I can tell yours!"" The girl stopped, surprised that a maid of the Gentiles should tell fortunes without glass balls, cards, or even looking at the lines of the hand. ""Tell it then,"" she said defiantly. ""You will live to marry Billy!"" she said. Then Lepronia Lovell laughed a short laugh, and said, ""Never while there's a daycent scarecrow in the world will I set up a tent-stick along with the likes of Billy Blythe!"" But all the same she walked away very thoughtful, her basketful of tinware clattering at her back.
