"CHAPTER XXXVIII. HUGH JOHN'S BLIGHTED HEART.  On the first evening at home Hugh John put on his new straw hat with its becoming school ribbon of brown, white and blue, for he did not forget that Prissy had described Cissy Carter as ""such a pretty girl."" Now pretty girls are quite nice when they are jolly. What a romp he would have, and even the stile would not be half bad. He ran down to the landing-stage, having given his old bat and third best fishing-rod to his brother to occupy his attention. Toady Lion was in an unusually adoring frame of mind, chiefly owing to the new bat with the silver inscription which Hugh John had brought home with him. If that were Toady Lion's attitude, how would it be with the enthusiastic Cissy Carter? She must be more than sixteen now. He liked grown-up girls, he thought, so long as they were pretty. And Cissy was pretty, Prissy had distinctly said so. The white punt bumped against the landing-stage, but the brown was gone. However, he could see it at the other side, swaying against the new pier which Mr. Davenant Carter had built opposite to that of Windy Standard. This was another improvement; you used to have to tie the boat to a bush of bog-myrtle and jump into wet squashy ground. The returned exile sculled over and tied up the punt to an iron ring. Then with a high and joyous heart he started over the moor, taking the well-beaten path towards Oaklands. Suddenly, through the wood as it grew thinner and more birchy, he saw the gleam of a white dress. Two girls were walking--no, not two girls, Prissy and a young lady. ""Oh hang!"" said Hugh John to himself, ""somebody that's stopping with the Carters. She'll go taking up all Cissy's time, and I wanted to see such a lot of her."" The white dresses and summer hats walked composedly on. ""I tell you what,"" said Hugh John to himself, ""I'll scoot through the woods and give them a surprise."" And in five minutes he leaped from a bank into the road immediately before the girls. Prissy gave a little scream, threw up her hands, and then ran eagerly to him. ""Why, Hugh John,"" she cried, ""have you really come? How could you frighten us like that, you bad boy!"" And she kissed him--well, just as Prissy always did. Meanwhile the young lady had turned partly away, and was pulling carelessly at a leaf--as if such proceedings, if not exactly offensive, were nevertheless highly uninteresting. ""Cissy,"" called Priscilla at last, ""won't you come and shake hands with Hugh John."" The girl turned slowly. She was robed in white linen belted with slim scarlet. The dress came quite down to the tops of her dainty boots. She held out her hand. ""How do you do--ah, Mr. Smith?"" she said, with her fingers very much extended indeed. Hugh John gasped, and for a long moment found no word to say. ""Why, Cissy, how you've grown!"" he cried at length. But observing no gleam of fellow-feeling in his quondam comrade's eyes, he added somewhat lamely, ""I mean how do you do, Miss--Miss Carter?"" There was silence after this, as the three walked on together, Prissy talking valiantly in order to cover the long and distressful silences. Hugh John's usual bubbling river of speech was frozen upon his lips. He had a thousand things to tell, a thousand thousand to ask. But now it did not seem worth while to speak of one. Why should a young lady like this, with tan gloves half-way to her elbows and the shiniest shoes, with stockings of black silk striped with red, care to hear about his wonderful bat for the three-figure score at cricket, or the fact that he had won the golf medal by doing the round in ninety-five? He had even thought of taking some credit (girls will suck in anything you tell them, you know) for his place in his class, which was seventh. But he had intended to suppress the fact that the fifth form was not a very large one at St. Salvator's. But now he suddenly became conscious that these trivialities could not possibly interest a young lady who talked about the Hunt Ball in some such fashion as this: ""He is _such_ a nice partner, don't you know! He dances--oh, like an angel, and the floor was--well, just perfection!"" Hugh John did not catch the name of this paragon; but he hated the beast anyhow. He did not know that Cissy was only bragging about her bat, and cracking up her score at golf. ""Have you seen 'The White Lady of Avenel' at the Sobriety Theatre, Mr. Smith?"" she said, suddenly turning to him. ""No,"" grunted Hugh John, ""but I've seen the Drury Lane pantomime. It was prime!"" The next moment he was sorry he had said it. But the truth slipped out before he knew. For so little was Hugh John used to the society of grown-up big girls, that he did not know any better than to tell them the truth. ""Ah, yes!"" commented Cissy Carter condescendingly, ""I used quite to like going to pantomimes when I was a child!"" A slight and elegant young man, with a curling moustache turned up at the ends, came towards them down the bank. He had grey-and-white striped trousers on, a dark cutaway coat, and a smart straw hat set on the back of his head. He wore gloves and walked with a pretty cane. Hugh John loathed him on sight. ""Good-evening, Courtenay,"" said Cissy familiarly, ""this is my friend, Prissy Smith, of whom you have heard me speak; and this is her brother just home from school!"" (""What a beast! I hate him! Calls that a moustache, I daresay. Ha, ha! he should just see Ashwell Major's. And I can lick Ashwell Major with one hand!"") ""Aw,"" said the young man with the cane, superciliously stroking his maligned upper lip, ""the preparatory school, I daresay--Lord, was at one once myself--beastly hole!"" (""I don't doubt it, you look it,"" was Hugh John's mental note.) Aloud he said, ""Saint Salvator's is a ripping place. We beat Glen Fetto by an innings and ninety-one!"" Mr. Courtenay Carling took no notice. He was talking earnestly and confidentially to his cousin. Hugh John had had enough of this. ""Come on, Priss,"" he said roughly, ""let's go home."" Prissy was nothing loath. She was just aching to get him by himself, so that she might begin to burn incense at his manly shrine. She had had stacks of it ready, and the match laid for weeks and weeks. ""Good-night,"" said Cissy frigidly. Hugh John took hold of her dainty gloved fingers as gingerly as if each had been a stinging nettle, and dropped them as quickly. Mr. Courtenay Carling paused in his conversation just long enough to say over his shoulder, ""Ah--ta-ta--got lots of pets to run round and see, I s'pose--rabbits and guinea-pigs; used to keep 'em myself, you know, beastly things, ta-ta!"" And with Cissy by his side he moved off, alternately twirling his moustache and glancing approvingly down at her. Cissy on her part never once looked round, but kept poking her parasol into the plants at the side of the road, as determinedly as if it had been the old pike manufactured by the exiled king O'Donowitch. Such treatment could not have been at all good for such a miracle of silk and lace and cane; but somehow its owner did not seem to mind.

"""What an awful brute!"" burst out Hugh John, as soon as Prissy and he were clear. ""Oh, how _can_ you say so!"" said Prissy, much surprised; ""why, every one thinks him so nice. He has such lots of money, and is going to stand for Parliament--that is, if his uncle would only die, or have something happen to him!"" Her brother snorted, as if to convey his contempt for ""everybody's"" opinion on such a matter; but Prissy was too happy to care for aught save the fact that once more her dear Hugh John was safe at home. ""Do you know,"" she said lovingly, ""I could not sleep last night for thinking of your coming! It is so splendid. There's the loveliest lot of roses being planted in the new potting house, and I've got a pearl necklace to show you--such a beauty--and----"" Thus she rattled on, joyously ticking off all the things she had to show him. She ran a little ahead to look at him, then ran as quickly back to hug him. ""Oh, you dear!"" she exclaimed. And all the while the heart of the former valiant soldier sank deep and ever deeper into the split-new cricketing shoes he had been so proud of when he sallied forth to meet Cissy Carter by the stile. ""Come on,"" she cried presently, picking up her skirts. ""I'm so excited I don't know what to do. I can't keep quiet. I believe I can race you yet, for all you're so big and have won a silver cricket bat. How I shall love to see it! Come on, Hugh John, I'll race you to the gipsy camp for a pound of candy!"" But Hugh John did not want to race. He did not want _not_ to race. He did not want ever to do anything any more--only to fade away and die. His heart was cold and dead within him. He felt that he would never know happiness again. But he could not bear to disappoint Prissy the first night. Besides, he could easily enough beat her--he was sure of that. So he smiled indulgently and nodded acquiescence. He had not told her that he had won the school mile handicap from scratch. They started, and Hugh John began to run scientifically, as he had been taught to do at school, keeping a little behind Prissy, ready to spurt at the last and win by a neck. Doubtless this would have answered splendidly, only that Prissy ran so fast. She did not know anything about scientific sprinting, but she could run like the wind. So by the time they reached the Partan Burn she had completely outclassed Hugh John. With her skirts held high in her hand over she flew like a bird; but her brother, jumping the least bit too soon, went splash into the shallows, sending the water ten feet into the air. Like a shot Prissy was back, and reached a hand down to the vanquished scientific athlete. ""Oh, I'm so sorry, Hugh John,"" she said; ""I ought to have told you it had been widened. Don't let's race any more. I think I must have started too soon, and you'd have beaten me anyway. Here's the gipsy camp."" The world-weary exile looked about him. He had thought that at least it might be some manly pleasure to see Billy Blythe once more, and try a round with the Bounding Brothers. After all, what did it matter about girls? He had a twelve-bladed knife in his pocket which he intended for Billy, and he knew a trick of boxing--a feint with the right, and then an upward blow with the left, which he knew would interest his friend. But the tents were gone. The place where they had stood was green and unencumbered. Only an aged crone or two moved slowly about among the small thatched cottages. To one of these Hugh John addressed himself. ""Eh, master--Billy Blythe--why, he be 'listed for a sodger--a corp'ral they say he be, and may be sergeant by this time, shouldn't wonder. Eh, dearie, and the Boundin' Brothers--oh! ye mean the joompin' lads. They're off wi' a circus in Ireland. Nowt left but me and my owd mon! Thank ye, sir, you be a gentleman born, as anybody can see without the crossin' o' the hand."" Sadly Hugh John moved away, a still more blighted being. He left Prissy at the white lodge-gate in order that she might go home to meet Mr. Picton Smith on his return from the county town, where he had been judging the horses at an agricultural show. He would take a walk through the town, he said to himself, and perhaps he might meet some of his old enemies. He felt that above everything he would enjoy a sharp tussle. After all what save valour was worth living for? Wait till he was a soldier, and came back in uniform with a sword by his side and the scar of a wound on his forehead--would Cissy Carter despise him then? He would show her! In the meantime he had learned certain tricks of fence which he would rather like to prove on the countenances of his former foes. So with renewed hope in his heart he took his way through the town of Edam. The lamps were just being lighted, and Hugh John lounged along through the early dusk with his hands in his pockets, looking out for a cause of offence. Presently he came upon a brilliantly lighted building, into which young men and women were entering singly and in pairs. A hanging lamp shone down upon a noticeboard. He had nothing better to do. He stopped and read--     +--------------------------------------------------------+     |            Edam Mutual Improvement Society.            |     |                     _SEASON_ 18--                      |     |                                                        |     |          _Hon.

He only waited outside to hear Mr. N. Donnan's opening sentence. It ran thus: ""All ages of the world's history have borne testimony to the fact that peace is preferable to war, right to might, and the sweet still voice of Reason to the savage compulsions of brutal Force."" ""Oh, hang!"" ejaculated Hugh John, doubling his fist; ""did you ever hear such rot? I wish I could jolly well fetch Nipper Donnan one on the nob!"" And he sauntered on till he came to the burying-ground of Edam's ancient abbey. He wandered aimlessly up the short avenue, stood at the gate a while, then kicked it open and went in. He clambered about among the graves, stumbling over the grassy mounds till he came to the tombs of his ancestors. At least they were not quite his ancestors, but the principle was the same. ""There's nothing exclusive about me. I'll adopt them,"" said Hugh John to himself, as many another distinguished person had done before him. They were in fact the tombs of the Lorraines, the ancient possessors and original architects of the Castle of Windy Standard, which he had spilt his best blood to defend. Well, it was to attack. But no matter. He sat down and looked at the defaced and battered tombs in silence. Mighty thoughts coursed through his brain. His heart was filled full to the brim with the sadness of mortality. Tears of hopeless resignation stood in his eyes. It was the end, the solemn end of all. Soon he, too, like them, would be lying low and quiet. He began to be conscious of a general fatal weakness of the system, a hollowness of the chest (or stomach), which showed that the end was near.
