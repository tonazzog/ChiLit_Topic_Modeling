"CHAPTER 10. THE MOB IN THE PALACE. The angry people rose.  Twenty-thousand of the poorest, dirtiest, and most savage, went to the magistrates in a body, to declare their intention of planting the Tree of Liberty on a terrace of the Tuileries, on the 20th; and of presenting, at the same time, petitions to the king against his late prohibitions about the priests and the army.  It was easy to see what sort of petitions these were likely to be; but it had become difficult to make preparation for any expected public event,-- there were so many opinions to be consulted, and so much suspicion was abroad. Early in the morning of the 20th, a tall Lombardy poplar, which the people called their tree of liberty, was lying on a car in the lower part of the city, and the people were collecting in multitudes to make a procession with it to the palace.  A messenger from the magistrates spoke to the people against their scheme; but they said they were only going to do what they had a right to do: it was lawful to petition; and that was their errand.  So, on they went, their numbers being swelled by groups from every by-street on their way.  They drew two pieces of cannon with them, and carried abundance of tricolour flags and ribbons; and also various significant emblems, one of which was a bullock's heart with a spear through it, labelled ""the Aristocrat's heart.""  The magistrates next met them: but again the crowd declared they intended only what was lawful, and pushed on. They read their address in the Assembly, and then went, dancing and shouting, to plant their tree.  The iron gates of the Tuileries were all shut, and National soldiers and cannon appeared within; so that the tree could not be planted on the terrace, as designed.  There was a convent garden near, which served their purpose, and there was the tree of liberty erected. While this was doing, the Assembly dispersed till evening.  The crowd desired that the king would come out, and hear their petition.  They waited and waited, pressing against the iron gates, till some were near being pressed to death, and were not in the better humour for that.  The king did not appear.  After a while, the guard within were told that, if the king would not come out to his people, his people would go in to him.  As usual, there was no decision in the treatment of the people. After some hesitation, the guards opened one of the gates.  The multitude swarmed in; rushed at a wooden door of the palace; shivered it; and the royal household were at once at their mercy. Now at last the sovereign and his craving people met, face to face: met, too, that they might petition, and he reply.  But they were no longer fitted for coming to an understanding.  They despised him as weak, and a double-dealer; and he despised them for their ignorance, their tatters, and dirt.  He showed this day that he was no coward.  He was indolent, irresolute, and unable to act; but he could endure.  After this day, no one could, unrebuked, call him a coward.  When the mob began battering upon the door of the room in which he was, he ordered it to be thrown open.  Some of the gentlemen of his household had rushed in through another door, and requested him to stand in the recess of a large window.  They drove up a heavy table before him, and ranged themselves in front of it.  They begged him not to be alarmed.  ""Put your hand on my heart,"" replied the king, ""and see if I am afraid.""  The Princess Elizabeth flew to see what was doing to her brother.  She heard fierce threats from the mob against the queen.  They vowed they would have the blood of the mischievous Austrian woman.  The attendants begged the princess to go away from this scene.  ""No,"" said she, ""let them take me for the queen, and then she may have time to escape.""  They forced her away, however, with what emotions of admiration words cannot express. The king demanded of the riotous crowd what it was that they wanted. They cried that they would have the patriot ministers back again, and no prohibition about the clergy and the army.  The king replied that this was not the way, nor the time, to settle such matters.  Those who heard him must have respected him for having at last given a good and decided answer.  During the rest of the time, about three hours, he stood in the recess of the window, while the mob passed to and fro before the broad table which stood between him and them.  At the very beginning of the scene one of the people handed him a red woollen cap, such as the furious revolutionary people had taken to wearing, to show their patriotism.  This cap the king was bid to wear.  He put it on; and it was matter of complaint against him afterwards by his aristocratic adherents, that he had worn the red cap for three hours.  The fact was that he did not feel the cap on the top of his hair, matted with pomatum and powder as hair then was, and forgot it, till his family noticed it on his meeting them again.  He declared himself thirsty, and a ragamuffin handing him a half-empty bottle, he drank from it. The queen had attempted, with her children, to reach the room where the king was, but could not.  Each seems to have believed that it was the intention of the mob to murder one or both of them, and there was much said of the murderers' arms which were carried; but it does not now appear probable that there was any such intention.  There was nothing to prevent its execution; for the multitude could in a moment have overpowered ten times the number of adherents that were about the royal family; and the Assembly were not seen or heard of till past six, when the mob had been parading about the palace for an hour and a half. However, the royal party did expect murder, and their suspense of three hours must have been terrible. The queen was secured, like the king, behind a table.  She put a large tricolor cockade upon her head, and placed the Dauphin on a table before her.  There sat poor little Louis, with a great red woollen cap covering his head, down to his very eyes, seeing how his governess and the other ladies behind his mother were terrified, and perhaps finding out how his mother's heart was swelling, and well-nigh bursting, while her face and manner were calm and dignified.  He saw, too, the horrible things that were shown in the procession.  The bullock's heart was there; and there was a little gibbet, with a little doll hung to it, and his mother's name written below.  He heard many dreadful things said to her; but he also heard her answers, and saw that they pleased the people.  One angry woman stood and railed at the queen.  The queen asked whether she had ever seen her before, and whether she had ever done her any injury. ""No,"" said the woman; ""but it is you who have done the country so much harm.""
