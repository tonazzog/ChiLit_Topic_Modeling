"CHAPTER XV. THE QUEEN'S WAND.   One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four;     'Tis still one, two, three, four.   Mellow and silvery are the tones,     But I wish the bells were more.  Mopsa woke: she was rather too big to be nursed, for she was the size of Jack, and looked like a sweet little girl of ten years, but she did not always behave like one; sometimes she spoke as wisely as a grown-up woman, and sometimes she changed again and seemed like a child. Mopsa lifted up her head and pushed back her long hair: her coronet had fallen off while she was in the bed of reeds; and she said to the beautiful dame,-- ""I am a queen now."" ""Yes, my sweet Queen,"" answered the lady, ""I know you are."" ""And you promise that you will be kind to me till I grow up,"" said Mopsa, ""and love me, and teach me how to reign?"" ""Yes,"" repeated the lady; ""and I will love you too, just as if you were a mortal and I your mother."" ""For I am only ten years old yet,"" said Mopsa, ""and the throne is too big for me to sit upon; but I am a queen."" And then she paused, and said, ""Is it three o'clock?"" As she spoke, the sweet, clear bell of the castle sounded three times, and then chimes began to play: they played such a joyous tune that it made everybody sing. The dame sang, the crowd of fairies sang, the boy who was Jack's double sang, and Mopsa sang,--only Jack was silent,--and this was the song:--   The prince shall to the chase again,   The dame has got her face again,   The king shall have his place again     Aneath the fairy dome.   And all the knights shall woo again,   And all the doves shall coo again,   And all the dreams come true again,     And Jack shall go home. ""We shall see about that!"" thought Jack to himself. And Mopsa, while she sang those last words, burst into tears, which Jack did not like to see; but all the fairies were so very glad, so joyous, and so delighted with her for having come to be their queen, that after a while she dried her eyes, and said to the wrong boy,-- ""Jack, when I pulled the lining out of your pocket-book there was a silver fourpence in it."" ""Yes,"" said the real Jack, ""and here it is."" ""Is it real money?"" asked Mopsa. ""Are you sure you brought it with you all the way from your own country?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""quite sure."" ""Then, dear Jack,"" answered Mopsa, ""will you give it to me?"" ""I will,"" said Jack, ""if you will send this boy away."" ""How can I?"" answered Mopsa, surprised. ""Don't you know what happened when the door closed? Has nobody told you?"" ""I did not see any one after I got into the place,"" said Jack. ""There was no one to tell anything,--not even a fawn, nor the brown doe. I have only seen down here these fairy people, and this boy, and this lady."" ""The lady is the brown doe,"" answered Mopsa; ""and this boy and the fairies were the fawns."" Jack was so astonished at this that he stared at the lady and the boy and the fairies with all his might. ""The sun came shining in as I stepped inside,"" said Mopsa, ""and a long beam fell down from the fairy dome across my feet. Do you remember what the apple-woman told us,--how it was reported that the brown doe and her nation had a queen whom they shut up, and never let the sun shine on her? That was not a kind or true report, and yet it came from something that really happened."" ""Yes, I remember,"" said Jack; ""and if the sun did shine they were all to be turned into deer."" ""I dare not tell you all that story yet,"" said Mopsa; ""but, Jack, as the brown doe and all the fawns came up to greet me, and passed by turns into the sunbeam, they took their own forms, every one of them, because the spell was broken. They were to remain in the disguise of deer till a queen of alien birth should come to them against her will. I am a queen of alien birth, and did not I come against my will?"" ""Yes, to be sure,"" answered Jack. ""We thought all the time that we were running away."" ""If ever you come to Fairyland again,"" observed Mopsa, ""you can save yourself the trouble of trying to run away from the old mother."" ""I shall not 'come,'"" answered Jack, ""because I shall not go,--not for a long while, at least. But the boy,--I want to know why this boy turned into another ME?"" ""Because he is the heir, of course,"" answered Mopsa. ""But I don't see that this is any reason at all,"" said Jack. Mopsa laughed. ""That's because you don't know how to argue,"" she replied. ""Why, the thing is as plain as possible."" ""It may be plain to you,"" persisted Jack, ""but it's no reason."" ""No reason!"" repeated Mopsa, ""no reason! when I like you the best of anything in the world, and when I am come here to be queen? Of course, when the spell was broken he took exactly your form on that account; and very right too."" ""But why?"" asked Jack. Mopsa, however, was like other fairies in this respect,--that she knew all about Old Mother Fate, but not about causes and reasons. She believed, as we do in this world, that but the fairies go further than this; they say:--   That that is, is; and when it is, that is the reason that it is. This sounds like nonsense to us, but it is all right to them. So Mopsa, thinking she had explained everything, said again,-- ""And, dear Jack, will you give the silver fourpence to me?"" Jack took it out; and she got down from the dame's knee and took it in the palm of her hand, laying the other palm upon it. ""It will be very hot,"" observed the dame. ""But it will not burn me so as really to hurt, if I am a real queen,"" said Mopsa. Presently she began to look as if something gave her pain. ""Oh, it's so hot!"" she said to the other Jack; ""so very hot!"" ""Never mind, sweet Queen,"" he answered; ""it will not hurt you long. Remember my poor uncle and all his knights."" Mopsa still held the little silver coin; but Jack saw that it hurt her, for two bright tears fell from her eyes; and in another moment he saw that it was actually melted, for it fell in glittering drops from Mopsa's hand to the marble floor, and there it lay as soft as quicksilver. ""Pick it up,"" said Mopsa to the other Jack; and he instantly did so, and laid it in her hand again; and she began gently to roll it backwards and forwards between her palms till she had rolled it into a very slender rod, two feet long, and not nearly so thick as a pin; but it did not bend, and it shone so brightly that you could hardly look at it. Then she held it out towards the real Jack, and said, ""Give this a name."" ""I think it is a----"" began the other Jack; but the dame suddenly stopped him. ""Silence, sire! Don't you know that what it is first called that it will be?"" Jack hesitated; he thought if Mopsa was a queen the thing ought to be a sceptre; but it certainly was not at all like a sceptre. ""That thing is a wand,"" said he. ""You are a wand,"" said Mopsa, speaking to the silver stick, which was glittering now in a sunbeam almost as if it were a beam of light itself. Then she spoke again to Jack: ""Tell me, Jack, what can I do with a wand?"" Again the boy-king began to speak, and the dame stopped him, and again Jack considered. He had heard a great deal in his own country about fairy wands, but he could not remember that the fairies had done anything particular with them, so he gave what he thought was true, but what seemed to him a very stupid answer: ""You can make it point to anything that you please."" The moment he had said this, shouts of ecstasy filled the hall, and all the fairies clapped their hands with such hurrahs of delight that he blushed for joy. The dame also looked truly glad, and as for the other Jack, he actually turned head over heels, just as Jack had often done himself on his father's lawn.

"Jack had merely meant that Mopsa could point with the wand to anything that she saw; but he was presently told that what he had meant was nothing, and that his words were everything. ""I can make it point now,"" said Mopsa, ""and it will point aright to anything I please, whether I know where the thing is or not."" Again the hall was filled with those cries of joy, and the sweet, child-like fairies congratulated each other with ""The Queen has got a wand,--a wand! and she can make it point wherever she pleases!"" Then Mopsa rose and walked towards the beautiful staircase, the dame and all the fairies following. Jack was going too, but the other Jack held him. ""Where is Mopsa going? and why am I not to follow?"" inquired Jack. ""They are going to put on her robes, of course,"" answered the other Jack. ""I am so tired of always hearing you say 'of course,'"" answered Jack; ""and I wonder how it is that you always seem to know what is going to be done without being told. However, I suppose you can't help being odd people."" The boy-king did not make a direct answer; he only said, ""I like you very much, though you don't like me."" ""Why do you like me?"" asked Jack. So he opened his eyes wide with surprise: ""Most boys say Sire to me,"" he observed; ""at least they used to do when there were any boys here. However, that does not signify. Why, of course I like you, because I am so tired of being always a fawn, and you brought Mopsa to break the spell. You cannot think how disagreeable it is to have no hands, and to be all covered with hair. Now look at my hands; I can move them and turn them everywhere, even over my head if I like. Hoofs are good for nothing in comparison; and we could not talk."" ""Do tell me about it,"" said Jack. ""How did you become fawns?"" ""I dare not tell you,"" said the boy; ""and listen!--I hear Mopsa."" Jack looked, and certainly Mopsa was coming, but very strangely, he thought. Mopsa, like all other fairies, was afraid to whisper a spell with her eyes open; so a handkerchief was tied across them, and as she came on she felt her way, holding by the banisters with one hand, and with the other, between her finger and thumb, holding out the silver wand. She felt with her foot for the edge of the first stair; and Jack heard her say, ""I am much older,--ah! so much older, now I have got my wand. I can feel sorrow too, and _their_ sorrow weighs down my heart."" Mopsa was dressed superbly in a white satin gown, with a long, long train of crimson velvet which was glittering with diamonds; it reached almost from one end of the great gallery to the other, and had hundreds of fairies to hold it and keep it in its place. But in her hair were no jewels, only a little crown made of daisies, and on her shoulders her robe was fastened with the little golden image of a boat. These things were to show the land she had come from and the vessel she had come in. So she came slowly, slowly down stairs blindfold, and muttering to her wand all the time:   Though the sun shine brightly,   Wand, wand, guide rightly. So she felt her way down to the great hall. There the wand turned half round in the hall toward the great door, and she and Jack and the other Jack came out into the lawn in front with all the followers and trainbearers; only the dame remained behind. Jack noticed now for the first time that, with the one exception of the boy-king, all these fairies were lady-fairies; he also observed that Mopsa, after the manner of fairy queens, though she moved slowly and blindfold, was beginning to tell a story. This time it did not make him feel sleepy. It did not begin at the beginning: their stories never do. These are the first words he heard, for she spoke softly and very low, while he walked at her right hand, and the other Jack on her left: ""And so now I have no wings. But my thoughts can go up (Jovinian and Roxaletta could not think). My thoughts are instead of wings; but they have dropped with me now, as a lark among the clods of the valley. Wand, do you bend? Yes, I am following, wand. ""And after that the bird said, 'I will come when you call me.' I never have seen her moving overhead; perhaps she is out of sight. Flocks of birds hover over the world, and watch it high up where the air is thin. There are zones, but those in the lowest zone are far out of sight. ""I have not been up there. I have no wings. ""Over the highest of the birds is the place where angels float and gather the children's souls as they are set free. ""And so that woman told me,--(Wand, you bend again, and I will turn at your bending),--that woman told me how it was: for when the new king was born, a black fairy with a smiling face came and sat within the doorway. She had a spindle, and would always spin. She wanted to teach them how to spin, but they did not like her, and they loved to do nothing at all. So they turned her out. ""But after her came a brown fairy, with a grave face, and she sat on the black fairy's stool and gave them much counsel. They liked that still less; so they got spindles and spun, for they said, 'She will go now, and we shall have the black fairy again.' When she did not go they turned her out also, and after her came a white fairy, and sat in the same seat. She did nothing at all, and she said nothing at all; but she had a sorrowful face, and she looked up. So they were displeased. They turned her out also; and she went and sat by the edge of the lake with her two sisters. ""And everything prospered over all the land; till, after shearing-time, the shepherds, because the king was a child, came to his uncle and said, 'Sir, what shall we do with the old wool, for the new fleeces are in the bales, and there is no storehouse to put them in?' So he said, 'Throw them into the lake.' ""And while they threw them in, a great flock of finches flew to them, and said, 'Give us some of the wool that you do not want; we should be glad of it to build our nests with.' ""They answered, 'Go and gather for yourselves; there is wool on every thorn.' ""Then the black fairy said, 'They shall be forgiven this time, because the birds should pick wool for themselves.' ""So the finches flew away. ""Then the harvest was over, and the reapers came and said to the child-king's uncle, 'Sir, what shall we do with the new wheat, for the old is not half eaten yet, and there is no room in the granaries?' ""He said, 'Throw that into the lake also.' ""While they were throwing it in, there came a great flight of the wood fairies, fairies of passage from over the sea. They were in the form of pigeons, and they alighted and prayed them, 'O, cousins! we are faint with our long flight; give us some of that corn which you do not want, that we may peck it and be refreshed.' ""But they said, 'You may rest on our land, but our corn is our own. Rest awhile, and go and get food in your own fields.' ""Then the brown fairy said, 'They may be forgiven this once, but yet it is a great unkindness.'
