"CHAPTER 3. A MORNING WITH A TADPOLE. It so happened that on the day following Stephen Greenfield's arrival at Saint Dominic's, the head master, Dr Senior, was absent. This circumstance gave great satisfaction to the new boy when his brother told him of it, as it put off for another twenty-four hours the awful moment when he would be forced to expose his ignorance before that terrible personage. ""You'd better stick about in my room while I'm in school,"" said Oliver, ""and then you can come down to the cricket-field and see the practice. By the way, some of the fellows may be in to bag my ink; they always run short on Friday; but don't let them take it, for I shall want it to-night.  Ta, ta; give my love to the _mater_ if you're writing home. I'll be back for you after the twelve bell."" And off he went, leaving Stephen to follow his own sweet devices for three hours. That young gentleman was at no loss how to occupy part of the time.  He must write home.  So after much searching he unearthed a crumpled sheet of note-paper from one of the drawers, and set himself to his task.  As he wrote, and his thoughts flew back to the home and the mother he had left only yesterday, his spirits fell, and the home-sickness came over him worse than ever.  What would he not give to change places with this very letter, and go back home! Here, no one cared for him, every one seemed to despise him.  He wasn't used to those rough public schools, and would never get on at Saint Dominic's.  Ah! that wretched Tenth Fiji War.  What _would_ become of him to-morrow when the Doctor would be back?  There was no one to help him.  Even Oliver seemed determined to let him fight his own battles. Poor boy!  He sat back in his chair and let his mind wander once more back to the snug little home he had left.  And, as he did so, his eyes unconsciously filled with tears, and he felt as if he would give anything to escape from Saint Dominic's. At this moment the door opened and a small boy entered. He did not seem to expect to find any one in the room, for he uttered a hurried ""Hullo!"" as he caught sight of Stephen. Stephen quickly dashed away a tear and looked up. ""Where's Greenfield?"" demanded the small boy. ""He's in school,"" replied Stephen. ""Hullo! what are you blubbering at?"" cried the small boy, growing very bold and patronising all of a sudden, ""eh?"" Stephen did not answer this home question. ""I suppose you are a new kid, just left your mammy?"" observed the other, with the air of a man of forty; ""what's your name, young 'un?"" ""Oh, my! is it?  What form are you in?"" ""I don't know yet."" ""Haven't you been examined?"" ""Oh, of course; old Senior's away.  Never mind, you'll catch it to-morrow, blub-baby!"" This last epithet was thrown in in such a very gratuitous and offensive way, that Stephen did not exactly like it. The small youth, however, finding himself in a bantering mood, pursued his questions with increasing venom. ""I suppose they call you Steenie at home?"" he observed, with a sneer that was meant to be quite annihilating. ""No, they don't,"" replied Stephen; ""mother calls me Steevie."" ""Oh, Steevie, does she?  Well, Steevie, were you ever licked over the knuckles with a ruler?"" ""No,"" replied Stephen; ""why?"" ""Because you will be--I know who'll do it, too, and kick you on the shins, too, if you're cheeky!"" Stephen was quite at a loss whether to receive this piece of news in the light of information or a threat.  He was inclined to believe it the latter; and as he was a rash youth, he somewhat tartly replied, ""_You_ won't!"" The small boy looked astounded--not that he ever contemplated attempting the chastisement about which he had talked; but the idea of a new boy defying _him_, one of the chosen leaders of the Tadpoles, who had been at Saint Dominic's two years, was amazing.  He glared at the rash Stephen for half a minute, and then broke out, ""Won't I? that's all! you see, you pretty little blubber boy!  Yow-ow-ow! little sneak! why don't you cut behind your mammy's skirt, if you're afraid?  I would cry if I were you.  Where's his bottle?  Poor infant!  Yow-ow-boo-boo!"" This tornado, delivered with increasing vehemence and offensiveness, quite overpowered Stephen, who stared at the boy as if he had been a talking frog. That youth evidently seemed to expect that his speech would produce a far deeper impression than it did, for he looked quite angry when Stephen made no reply. ""Wretched little sneak!"" the amiable one continued; ""I suppose he'll go peaching to his big brother.  Never mind, _we'll_ pay you out, see if we don't!  Go and kiss your mammy, and tell your big brother what they did to little duckie Steevie, did they then? they shouldn't!  Give him a suck of his bottle! oh, my!"" and he finished up with a most withering laugh.  Then, suddenly remembering his errand, he walked up to the table, and said, ""I want that inkpot!"" Now was Stephen's time.  He was just in the humour for an argument with this young Philistine. ""What's that to you? give it up!"" ""I shan't give it up; Oliver said it was not to be taken."" ""What do you say?"" yelled the small boy, almost beside himself with rage and astonishment.  ""It's my brother's ink, and I'm not to give it up,"" said Stephen, shutting the top and keeping his hand on it. It was enough!  The patriarch of the Tadpoles knew his strong point was in words rather than action; but this could not be endured.  At whatever risk, the dignity of his order must be maintained, and this insolent, mad new boy must be--kicked. ""I'll kick you on the legs if you don't give it up,"" said the Tadpole, in a suppressed white heat. Stephen said nothing, but kept his hand on the pot, and awaited what was to follow. The hero stepped back a pace or two, to allow of a run worthy of the coming kick; and what might have happened no one knows.  At that moment the door opened, and Pembury entered on his crutches. At sight of this Fifth Form celebrity the Tadpole cringed and cowered, and tried to sneak out of the study unobserved.  But Anthony was too quick for him.  Gently hooking him by the coat-collar with the end of a crutch, he brought him back. ""What are you doing here?"" ""Yes, he is,"" shouted Stephen; ""he's been trying to take, away Oliver's ink."" ""Silence, young gentleman, pray!"" said Pembury, very grandly.  Then, turning to the Tadpole, he added, ""Oh, so you've been trying to bag some ink, have you?"" ""Well, I only wanted a little; and this--"" ""Silence! how much ink did you want?"" ""Only half a potful."" ""You shall have half a potful!"" said Pembury.  ""Come here."" The Tadpole obeyed, and glared triumphantly at Stephen. ""Now, Master Greenfield,"" said Pembury, addressing Stephen; ""have the kindness to hand me the ink."" Stephen hesitated; he felt _sure_ Anthony was a master; and yet Oliver's directions had been explicit. ""Do you hear?"" thundered Anthony. ""Do you hear?"" squeaked the Tadpole, delighted to have the tables turned on his adversary.
