"CHAPTER XXIX. I COME INTO MY KINGDOM For some time Alan volleyed upon the door, and his knocking only roused the echoes of the house and neighbourhood. At last, however, I could hear the noise of a window gently thrust up, and knew that my uncle had come to his observatory. By what light there was, he would see Alan standing, like a dark shadow, on the steps; the three witnesses were hidden quite out of his view; so that there was nothing to alarm an honest man in his own house. For all that, he studied his visitor awhile in silence, and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving. “What’s this?” says he. “This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk; and I hae nae trokings* wi’ night-hawks. What brings ye here? I have a blunderbush.”      * Dealings. “Is that yoursel’, Mr. Balfour?” returned Alan, stepping back and looking up into the darkness. “Have a care of that blunderbuss; they’re nasty things to burst.” “What brings ye here? and whae are ye?” says my uncle, angrily. “I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side,” said Alan; “but what brings me here is another story, being more of your affair than mine; and if ye’re sure it’s what ye would like, I’ll set it to a tune and sing it to you.” “And what is’t?” asked my uncle. “David,” says Alan. “What was that?” cried my uncle, in a mighty changed voice. “Shall I give ye the rest of the name, then?” said Alan. There was a pause; and then, “I’m thinking I’ll better let ye in,” says my uncle, doubtfully. “I dare say that,” said Alan; “but the point is, Would I go? Now I will tell you what I am thinking. I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel’, and a gentleman of better family.” This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer; he was a little while digesting it, and then says he, “Weel, weel, what must be must,” and shut the window. But it took him a long time to get down-stairs, and a still longer to undo the fastenings, repenting (I dare say) and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar. At last, however, we heard the creak of the hinges, and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and (seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two) sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands. “And, now” says he, “mind I have my blunderbush, and if ye take a step nearer ye’re as good as deid.” “And a very civil speech,” says Alan, “to be sure.” “Na,” says my uncle, “but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding, and I’m bound to be prepared. And now that we understand each other, ye’ll can name your business.” “Why,” says Alan, “you that are a man of so much understanding, will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman. My name has nae business in my story; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull, of which ye will have heard. It seems there was a ship lost in those parts; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands, when he came upon a lad that was half drowned. Well, he brought him to; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld, ruined castle, where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends. My friends are a wee wild-like, and not so particular about the law as some that I could name; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk, and was your born nephew, Mr. Balfour, they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter. And I may tell ye at the off-go, unless we can agree upon some terms, ye are little likely to set eyes upon him. For my friends,” added Alan, simply, “are no very well off.” My uncle cleared his throat. “I’m no very caring,” says he. “He wasnae a good lad at the best of it, and I’ve nae call to interfere.” “Ay, ay,” said Alan, “I see what ye would be at: pretending ye don’t care, to make the ransom smaller.” “Na,” said my uncle, “it’s the mere truth. I take nae manner of interest in the lad, and I’ll pay nae ransome, and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care.” “Hoot, sir,” says Alan. “Blood’s thicker than water, in the deil’s name! Ye cannae desert your brother’s son for the fair shame of it; and if ye did, and it came to be kennt, ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side, or I’m the more deceived.” “I’m no just very popular the way it is,” returned Ebenezer; “and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt. No by me, onyway; nor yet by you or your friends. So that’s idle talk, my buckie,” says he. “Then it’ll have to be David that tells it,” said Alan. “How that?” says my uncle, sharply. “Ou, just this way,” says Alan. “My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it, but if there was nane, I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased, and be damned to him!” “Ay, but I’m no very caring about that either,” said my uncle. “I wouldnae be muckle made up with that.” “I was thinking that,” said Alan. “And what for why?” asked Ebenezer. “Why, Mr. Balfour,” replied Alan, “by all that I could hear, there were two ways of it: either ye liked David and would pay to get him back; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him, and would pay for us to keep him. It seems it’s not the first; well then, it’s the second; and blythe am I to ken it, for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends.” “I dinnae follow ye there,” said my uncle. “No?” said Alan. “Well, see here: you dinnae want the lad back; well, what do ye want done with him, and how much will ye pay?” My uncle made no answer, but shifted uneasily on his seat. “Come, sir,” cried Alan. “I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman; I bear a king’s name; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door. Either give me an answer in civility, and that out of hand; or by the top of Glencoe, I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals.” “Eh, man,” cried my uncle, scrambling to his feet, “give me a meenit! What’s like wrong with ye? I’m just a plain man and nae dancing master; and I’m tryin to be as ceevil as it’s morally possible. As for that wild talk, it’s fair disrepitable. Vitals, says you! And where would I be with my blunderbush?” he snarled. “Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan,” said the other. “Before your jottering finger could find the trigger, the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane.” “Eh, man, whae’s denying it?” said my uncle. “Pit it as ye please, hae’t your ain way; I’ll do naething to cross ye. Just tell me what like ye’ll be wanting, and ye’ll see that we’ll can agree fine.” “Troth, sir,” said Alan, “I ask for nothing but plain dealing. In two words: do ye want the lad killed or kept?” “O, sirs!” cried Ebenezer. “O, sirs, me! that’s no kind of language!” “Killed or kept!” repeated Alan. “O, keepit, keepit!” wailed my uncle. “We’ll have nae bloodshed, if you please.” “Well,” says Alan, “as ye please; that’ll be the dearer.” “The dearer?” cries Ebenezer. “Would ye fyle your hands wi’ crime?” ", time volley door knock rouse echo house neighbourhood last hear noise window thrust uncle observatory light stand dark shadow step witness hide view alarm honest man own house study visitor silence speak voice quaver misgiving nae kind time night decent folk hae nae troking night hawk bring blunderbush dealing return step darkness care blunderbuss nasty thing burst bring uncle manner inclination rowt name country side bring story more affair sure like set tune sing set ask uncle  cry uncle mighty change voice give rest name pause let uncle point doorstep confer business understand stiffnecked yoursel gentleman family change note disconcert digest shut window long time stair long undo fastening repent fresh clap fear second step bolt bar last hear creak hinge seem uncle slip step pace sate top doorstep blunderbuss ready hand mind blunderbush step deid civil speech sure uncle chanty kind proceeding bound prepare understand other name business man much understanding perceive gentleman name nae business story county friend hear seem ship lose part next day gentleman family seek wreck wood fire sand lad half drown bring other gentleman clapp auld ruin castle day great expense friend friend wee wild particular law name find lad own decent folk bear nephew ask give bit call confer matter off agree term likely set eye friend add uncle clear throat caring lad noe call interfere pretend care ransom small uncle mere truth nae manner interest lad pay ransome kirk mill care hoot sir blood thick water deil name desert brother son fair shame kennt popular country side deceive popular way return kennt friend idle talk buckie  uncle way friend keep nephew likelihood siller opinion let gang pleased damned caring uncle muckle  ask reply hear way like pay reason want pay keep seem first second pretty penny pocket pocket friend follow uncle want lad want much pay uncle answer shift seat cry gentleman bear king name rider kick shank hall door give answer civility hand top rum foot iron vital cry uncle scramble foot give meenit wrong plain man nae dancing master tryin ceevil possible wild talk fair disrepitable vital blunderbush snarl powder auld hand snail swallow bright steel hand other jottering finger find trigger hilt dirl breast bane deny uncle pit hae ain way naeth cross want agree ask plain deal word want lad kill keep sir cry kind language kill keep repeat wail uncle nae bloodshed dearer dearer cry fyle hand wil crime
