"CHAPTER 11. WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE SCHOOL-DESK. The next morning, when the whole school were assembled, and all the classes were getting ready for the real work of the day, Miss Good, the English teacher, stepped to the head of the room, and, holding a neatly bound volume of ""Jane Eyre"" in her hand, begged to know to whom it belonged.  There was a hush of astonishment when she held up the little book, for all the girls knew well that this special volume was not allowed for school literature. ""The house maid who dusts the school-room found this book on the floor,"" continued the teacher.  ""It lay beside a desk near the top of the room. I see the name has been torn out, so I cannot tell who is the owner.  I must request her, however, to step forward and take possession of her property.  If there is the slightest attempt at concealment, the whole matter will be laid before Mrs Willis at noon to-day."" When Miss Good had finished her little speech, she held up the book in its green binding and looked down the room. Hester did not know why her heart beat--no one glanced at her, no one regarded her; all eyes were fixed on Miss Good, who stood with a severe, unsmiling, but expectant face. ""Come, young ladies,"" she said, ""the owner has surely no difficulty in recognising her own property.  I give you exactly thirty seconds more; then, if no one claims the book, I place the affair in Mrs Willis's hands."" Just then there was a stir among the girls in the head class.  A tall girl in dove-coloured cashmere, with a smooth head of golden hair, and a fair face which was a good deal flushed at this moment, stepped to the front, and said in a clear and perfectly modulated voice-- ""I had no idea of concealing the fact that `Jane Eyre' belongs to me.  I was only puzzled for a moment to know how it got on the floor.  I placed it carefully in my desk last night.  I think this circumstance ought to be inquired into."" ""Oh! oh!"" came from several suppressed voices here and there through the room; ""whoever would have supposed that Dora Russell would be obliged to humble herself in this way?"" ""Attention, young ladies!"" said Miss Good; ""no talking, if you please. Do I understand, Miss Russell, that `Jane Eyre' is yours?"" ""Yes, Miss Good."" ""Why did you keep it in your desk--were you reading it during preparation?"" ""You are, of course, aware that you were breaking two very stringent rules of the school.  In the first place, no story-books are allowed to be concealed in a school-desk, or to be read during preparation.  In the second place, this special book is not allowed to be read at any time in Lavender House.  You know these rules, Miss Russell?"" ""Yes, Miss Good."" ""I must retain the book--you can return now to your place in class."" Miss Russell bowed sedately, and with an apparently unmoved face, except for the slightly deepened glow on her smooth cheek, resumed her interrupted work. Lessons went off as usual, but during recreation the mystery of the discovered book was largely discussed by the girls.  As is the custom of school-girls, they took violent sides in the matter--some rejoicing in Dora's downfall, some pitying her intensely.  Hester was, of course, one of Miss Russell's champions, and she looked at her with tender sympathy when she came with her haughty and graceful manner into the school-room, and her little heart beat with a vague hope that Dora might turn to her for sympathy. Dora, however, did nothing of the kind.  She refused to discuss the affair with her companions, and none of them quite knew what Mrs Willis said to her, or what special punishment was inflicted on the proud girl. Several of her school-fellows expected that Dora's drawing-room would be taken away from her, but she still retained it; and after a few days the affair of the book was almost forgotten. There was, however, an uncomfortable and an uneasy spirit abroad in the school.  Susan Drummond, who was certainly one of the most uninteresting girls in Lavender House, was often seen walking with and talking to Miss Forest.  Sometimes Annie shook her pretty head over Susan's remarks; sometimes she listened to her; sometimes she laughed and spoke eagerly for a moment or two, and appeared to acquiesce in suggestions which her companion urged. Annie had always been the soul of disorder--of wild pranks, of naughty and disobedient deeds--but, hitherto, in all her wildness she had never intentionally hurt any one but herself.  Hers was a giddy and thoughtless, but by no means a bitter tongue--she thought well of all her school-fellows--and on occasions she could be self-sacrificing and good-natured to a remarkable extent.  The girls of the head class took very little notice of Annie, but her other school-companions, as a rule, succumbed to her sunny, bright, and witty ways.  She offended them a hundred times a day, and a hundred times a day was forgiven.  Hester was the first girl in the third-class who had ever persistently disliked Annie and Annie, after making one or two overtures of friendship, began to return Miss Thornton's aversion; but she had never cordially hated her until the day they met in Cecil Temple's drawing-room and Hester had wounded Annie in her tenderest part by doubting her affection for Mrs Willis. Since that day there was a change very noticeable in Annie Forest--she was not so gay as formerly, but she was a great deal more mischievous-- she was not nearly so daring, but she was capable now of little actions slight in themselves, which yet were calculated to cause mischief and real unhappiness.  Her sudden friendship with Susan Drummond did her no good, and she persistently avoided all intercourse with Cecil Temple, who hitherto had influenced her in the right direction. The incident of the green book had passed with no apparent result of grave importance, but the spirit of mischief which had caused this book to be found was by no means asleep in the school.  Pranks were played in a most mysterious fashion with the girls' properties. Hester herself was the very next victim.  She too was a neat and orderly child--she was clever and thoroughly enjoyed her school work.  She was annoyed, therefore, and dreadfully puzzled, by discovering one morning that her neat French exercise-book was disgracefully blotted, and one page torn across.  She was severely reprimanded by Mdlle.  Perier for such gross untidiness and carelessness, and when she assured the governess that she knew nothing whatever of the circumstance, that she was never guilty of blots, and had left the book in perfect order the night before, the French lady only shrugged her shoulders, made an expressive gesture with her eyebrows, and plainly showed Hester that she thought the less she said on that subject the better.

"Hester was required to write out her exercise again, and she fancied she saw a triumphant look in Annie Forest's eyes as she left the school-room, where poor Hester was obliged to remain to undergo her unmerited punishment. ""Cecil,"" called Hester, in a passionate and eager voice, as Miss Temple was passing her place. Cecil paused for a moment. ""What is it, Hetty?--oh, I am so sorry you must stay in this lovely bright day."" ""I have done nothing wrong,"" said Hester; ""I never blotted this exercise-book; I never tore this page.  It is most unjust not to believe my word; it is most unjust to punish me for what I have not done."" Miss Temple's face looked puzzled and sad. ""I must not stay to talk to you now, Hester,"" she whispered; ""I am breaking the rules.  You can come to my drawing-room by-and-by, and we will discuss this matter."" But Hester and Cecil, talk as they would, could find no solution to the mystery.  Cecil absolutely refused to believe that Annie Forest had anything to do with the matter. ""No,"" she said, ""such deceit is not in Annie's nature.  I would do anything to help you, Hester; but I can't, and I won't, believe that Annie tried deliberately to do you any harm."" ""I am quite certain she did,"" retorted Hester, ""and from this moment I refuse to speak to her until she confesses what she has done and apologises to me.  Indeed, I have a great mind to go and tell everything to Mrs Willis."" ""Oh, I would not do that,"" said Cecil; ""none of your school-fellows would forgive you if you charged such a favourite as Annie with a crime which you cannot in the least prove against her.  You must be patient, Hester, and if you are, I will take your part, and try to get at the bottom of the mystery."" Cecil, however, failed to do so.  Annie laughed when the affair was discussed in her presence, but her clear eyes looked as innocent as the day, and nothing would induce Cecil to doubt Miss Forest's honour. The mischievous sprite, however, who was sowing such seeds of unhappiness in the hitherto peaceful school was not satisfied with two deeds of daring; for a week afterwards Cecil Temple found a book of Mrs Browning's, out of which she was learning a piece for recitation, with its cover half torn off, and, still worse, a caricature of Mrs Willis sketched with some cleverness and a great deal of malice on the title-page.  On the very same morning, Dora Russell, on opening her desk, was seen to throw up her hands with a gesture of dismay.  The neat composition she had finished the night before was not to be seen in its accustomed place, but in a corner of the desk were two bulky and mysterious parcels, one of which contained a great junk of rich plum-cake, and the other some very sticky and messy ""Turkish delight;"" while the paper which enveloped these luxuries was found to be that on which the missing composition was written.  Dora's face grew very white--she forgot the ordinary rules of the school, and, leaving her class, walked down the room, and interrupted Miss Good, who was beginning to instruct the third-class in English grammar. ""Will you please come and see something in my desk, Miss Good?"" she said in a voice which trembled with excitement. It was while she was speaking that Cecil found the copy of Mrs Browning mutilated, and with the disgraceful caricature on its title-page. Startled as she was by this discovery, and also by Miss Russell's extraordinary behaviour, she had presence of mind enough to hide the sight which pained her from her companions.  Unobserved, in the strong interest of the moment, for all the girls were watching Dora Russell and Miss Good, she managed to squeeze the little volume into her pocket. She had indeed received a great shock, for she knew well that the only girl who could caricature in the school was Annie Forest.  For a moment her troubled eyes sought the ground, but then she raised them and looked at Annie.  Annie, however, with a particularly cheerful face, and her bright dark eyes full of merriment, was gazing in astonishment at the scene which was taking place in front of Miss Russell's desk. Dora, whose enunciation was very clear, seemed to have absolutely forgotten herself; she disregarded Miss Good's admonitions, and declared stoutly that at such a moment she did not care what rules she broke. She was quite determined that the culprit who had dared to desecrate her composition, and put plum-cake and ""Turkish delight"" into her desk, should be publicly exposed and punished. ""The thing cannot go on any longer, Miss Good,"" she said; ""there is a girl in this school who ought to be expelled from it, and I for one declare openly that I will not submit to associate with a girl who is worse than unladylike.  If you will permit me, Miss Good, I will carry these things at once to Mrs Willis, and beg of her to investigate the whole affair, and bring the culprit to justice, and to turn her out of the school."" ""Stay, Miss Russell,"" exclaimed the English teacher, ""you strangely and completely forget yourself.  You are provoked.  I own, but you have no right to stand up and absolutely hoist the flag of rebellion in the faces of the other girls.  I cannot excuse your conduct.  I will myself take away these parcels which were found in your desk, and will report the affair to Mrs Willis.  She will take what steps she thinks right in bringing you to order, and in discovering the author of this mischief. Return instantly to your desk, Miss Russell; you strangely forget yourself."" Miss Good left the room, having removed the plum-cake and ""Turkish delight"" from Dora Russell's desk, and lessons continued as best they could under such exciting circumstances. At twelve o'clock that day, just as the girls were preparing to go up to their rooms to get ready for their usual walk, Mrs Willis came into the school-room. ""Stay one moment, young ladies,"" said the head-mistress in that slightly vibrating and authoritative voice of hers.  ""I have a word or two to say to you all.  Miss Good has just brought me a painful story of wanton and cruel mischief.  There are fifty girls in this school, who, until lately, lived happily together.  There is now one girl among the fifty whose object it is to sow seeds of discord and misery among her companions.  Miss Good has told me of three different occasions on which mischief has been done to different girls in the school.  Twice Miss Russell's desk has been disturbed, once Miss Thornton's.  It is possible that other girls may also have suffered who have been noble enough not to complain.  There is, however, a grave mischief, in short, a moral disease in our midst.  Such a thing is worse than bodily illness--it must be stamped out instantly and completely at the risk of any personal suffering.  I am now going to ask you, girls, a simple question, and I demand instant truth without any reservation.  Miss Russell's desk has been tampered with--Miss Thornton's desk has been tampered with.  Has any other girl suffered injury--has any other girl's desk been touched?""
