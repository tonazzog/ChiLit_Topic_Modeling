" Montemar was too near the frontier to be a safe abode for the little Duke, and his uncle, Count Hubert of Senlis, agreed with Bernard the Dane that he would be more secure beyond the limits of his own duchy, which was likely soon to be the scene of war; and, sorely against his will, he was sent in secret, under a strong escort, first to the Castle of Coucy, and afterwards to Senlis. His consolation was, that he was not again separated from his friends; Alberic, Sir Eric, and even Fru Astrida, accompanied him, as well as his constant follower, Osmond.  Indeed, the Baron would hardly bear that he should be out of his sight; and he was still so carefully watched, that it was almost like a captivity.  Never, even in the summer days, was he allowed to go beyond the Castle walls; and his guardians would fain have had it supposed that the Castle did not contain any such guest. Osmond did not give him so much of his company as usual, but was always at work in the armourer's forge--a low, vaulted chamber, opening into the Castle court.  Richard and Alberic were very curious to know what he did there; but he fastened the door with an iron bar, and they were forced to content themselves with listening to the strokes of the hammer, keeping time to the voice that sang out, loud and cheerily, the song of ""Sigurd's sword, and the maiden sleeping within the ring of flame.""  Fru Astrida said Osmond was quite right--no good weapon-smith ever toiled with open doors; and when the boys asked him questions as to his work, he only smiled, and said that they would see what it was when the call to arms should come. They thought it near at hand, for tidings came that Louis had assembled his army, and marched into Normandy to recover the person of the young Duke, and to seize the country.  No summons, however, arrived, but a message came instead, that Rouen had been surrendered into the bands of the King.  Richard shed indignant tears.  ""My father's Castle!  My own city in the hands of the foe!  Bernard is a traitor then!  None shall hinder me from so calling him.  Why did we trust him?"" ""Never fear, Lord Duke,"" said Osmond.  ""When you come to the years of Knighthood, your own sword shall right you, in spite of all the false Danes, and falser Franks, in the land."" ""What! you too, son Osmond?  I deemed you carried a cooler brain than to miscall one who was true to Rollo's race before you or yon varlet were born!"" said the old Baron. ""He has yielded my dukedom!  It is mis-calling to say he is aught but a traitor!"" cried Richard.  ""Vile, treacherous, favour-seeking--"" ""Peace, peace, my Lord,"" said the Baron.  ""Bernard has more in that wary head of his than your young wits, or my old ones, can unwind.  What he is doing I may not guess, but I gage my life his heart is right."" Richard was silent, remembering he had been once unjust, but he grieved heartily when he thought of the French in Rollo's tower, and it was further reported that the King was about to share Normandy among his French vassals.  A fresh outcry broke out in the little garrison of Senlis, but Sir Eric still persisted in his trust in his friend Bernard, even when he heard that Centeville was marked out as the prey of the fat French Count who had served for a hostage at Rouen. ""What say you now, my Lord?"" said he, after a conference with a messenger at the gate.  ""The Black Raven has spread its wings.  Fifty keels are in the Seine, and Harald Blue-tooth's Long Serpent at the head of them."" ""The King of Denmark! Come to my aid!"" ""Ay, that he is!  Come at Bernard's secret call, to right you, and put you on your father's seat.  Now call honest Harcourt a traitor, because he gave not up your fair dukedom to the flame and sword!"" ""No traitor to me,"" said Richard, pausing.  ""No, verily, but what more would you say?"" ""I think, when I come to my dukedom, I will not be so politic,"" said Richard.  ""I will be an open friend or an open foe."" ""The boy grows too sharp for us,"" said Sir Eric, smiling, ""but it was spoken like his father."" ""He grows more like his blessed father each day,"" said Fru Astrida. ""But the Danes, father, the Danes!"" said Osmond.  ""Blows will be passing now.  I may join the host and win my spurs?"" ""With all my heart,"" returned the Baron, ""so my Lord here gives you leave: would that I could leave him and go with you.  It would do my very spirit good but to set foot in a Northern keel once more."" ""I would fain see what these men of the North are,"" said Osmond. ""Oh! they are only Danes, not Norsemen, and there are no Vikings, such as once were when Ragnar laid waste--"" ""Son, son, what talk is this for the child's ears?"" broke in Fru Astrida, ""are these words for a Christian Baron?"" ""Your pardon, mother,"" said the grey warrior, in all humility, ""but my blood thrills to hear of a Northern fleet at hand, and to think of Osmond drawing sword under a Sea-King."" The next morning, Osmond's steed was led to the door, and such men-at-arms as could be spared from the garrison of Senlis were drawn up in readiness to accompany him.  The boys stood on the steps, wishing they were old enough to be warriors, and wondering what had become of him, until at length the sound of an opening door startled them, and there, in the low archway of the smithy, the red furnace glowing behind him, stood Osmond, clad in bright steel, the links of his hauberk reflecting the light, and on his helmet a pair of golden wings, while the same device adorned his long pointed kite-shaped shield. ""Your wings! our wings!"" cried Richard, ""the bearing of Centeville!"" ""May they fly after the foe, not before him,"" said Sir Eric.  ""Speed thee well, my son--let not our Danish cousins say we learn Frank graces instead of Northern blows."" With such farewells, Osmond quitted Senlis, while the two boys hastened to the battlements to watch him as long as he remained in view. The highest tower became their principal resort, and their eyes were constantly on the heath where he had disappeared; but days passed, and they grew weary of the watch, and betook themselves to games in the Castle court. One day, Alberic, in the character of a Dragon, was lying on his back, panting hard so as to be supposed to cast out volumes of flame and smoke at Richard, the Knight, who with a stick for a lance, and a wooden sword, was waging fierce war; when suddenly the Dragon paused, sat up, and pointed towards the warder on the tower.  His horn was at his lips, and in another moment, the blast rang out through the Castle. With a loud shout, both boys rushed headlong up the turret stairs, and came to the top so breathless, that they could not even ask the warder what he saw.  He pointed, and the keen-eyed Alberic exclaimed, ""I see! Look, my Lord, a speck there on the heath!"" ""I do not see! where, oh where?"" ""He is behind the hillock now, but--oh, there again!  How fast he comes!"" ""It is like the flight of a bird,"" said Richard, ""fast, fast--"" ",frontier safe abode uncle agree secure limit own duchy scene war will send secret strong escort consolation separate friend accompany constant follower bear sight watch captivity summer day allow wall guardian suppose contain such guest give much company usual work armourer forge low vault chamber open court curious fasten door iron bar force content listen stroke hammer keep time voice sing loud song sword maiden sleeping ring flame right weapon smith toil open door boy ask question work smile call arm hand tiding assemble army march recover person young seize country summons arrive message surrender band shed indignant tear father own city hand foe traitor hinder call trust fear year own sword spite false falser land son deem carry cool brain miscall true race varlet bear old yield dukedom aught traitor cry vile treacherous favour seek peace peace more wary head young wit old one unwind guess gage life heart right silent remember unjust grieve tower report about share french vassal fresh outcry break garrison persist trust friend hear mark prey fat french serve hostage conference messenger gate black spread wing keel tooth long head aid secret call right put father seat call honest traitor give fair dukedom flame sword traitor pause more dukedom politic open friend open foe boy grow sharp smile speak father grow bless father day father blow pass join host win spur heart return give leave leave very spirit set foot northern keel more man such lay waste son son talk child ear break word christian pardon mother grey warrior humility blood thrill hear northern fleet hand draw sword next morning steed lead door such man arm spare garrison draw readiness accompany boy stand step wish old warrior wonder become length sound open door startle low archway smithy red furnace glow stand clad bright steel link hauberk reflect light helmet pair golden wing same device adorn long point kite shape shield wing wing cry bear fly foe speed let danish cousin learn grace northern blow such farewell quit boy hasten battlement watch remain view high tower become principal resort eye heath disappear day pass grow weary watch betak game court day character lie back pant suppose cast volume flame smoke stick lance wooden sword wage fierce war pause sit point warder tower horn lip moment blast ring loud shout boy rush turret stair top breathless ask warder point keen eyed exclaim speck heath  hillock flight bird fast fast
