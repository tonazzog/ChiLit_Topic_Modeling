"As so many cocoa-nut trees had been cut down to build the house, there were plenty of boughs lying in every direction, and William and Mr Seagrave had soon procured sufficient.  In a very short time the boat was drawn up about ten yards from the water's edge, which Ready said was quite sufficient; they then dug from under with their shovels until the boat was sunk about half down in the sand. Having filled in the sand all round her up to her gunnel, the boat was then carefully covered over with the boughs, which were weighed down with sand that they might not be blown away. ""I don't see why you should cover the boat up in this way, Ready; the rain won't hurt her,"" observed William. ""No, sir, the rain won't do her any harm, but the sun will, when it bursts out occasionally; for it's very powerful when it does shine, and it would split her all to pieces."" ""I forgot that,"" replied William.  ""What shall we do now?"" ""Suppose, as we have two hours to dinner-time, you run for the lines, William, and we'll try for some fish."" ""We cannot all three of us fish with only two lines,"" said Mr Seagrave. ""No, sir; and as William knows how to catch them, suppose you remain with him, and I will go up and collect wood and chips for Juno's fire. She was hard pressed for it this morning, it was so wet; but, if once piled up, it will soon be dry.  Be careful, Mr Seagrave, not to hold the lines tight in your hands, or you may be jerked into the water."" Mr Seagrave and William were very fortunate; before the two hours were expired they had caught eight large fish, which they brought up to the house slung on the boat-hook.  Tommy hallooed loudly for fish for dinner, and as they had caught so many, it was agreed that the dinner should be put off until some could be got ready, and they were not sorry to eat them instead of salt pork. They had hardly sat down to table, when the rain came pattering down on the roof, and in a quarter of an hour the storm was as violent, and the thunder and lightning as terrific as on the day before.  All outdoor labour was again suspended.  Mrs Seagrave, Juno, and Caroline took their work, for there was plenty to do with the needle and thread, and Ready soon found employment for the rest.  William and Mr Seagrave unlaid some thick rope, that Ready might make smaller and more useful rope with the yarns.  Ready took up his sailing needles, and worked eyelet-holes in the canvas screens (which they had put up in a hurry), so that they might be drawn to and fro as required. As soon as Ready had hung up the curtains, he looked under the bedsteads for a large bundle, and said, as he opened it, ""I shall now decorate Madam Seagrave's sleeping-place.  It ought to be handsomer than the others.""  The bundle was composed of the ship's ensign, which was red, and a large, square, yellow flag with the name of the ship _Pacific_ in large black letters upon it.  These two flags Ready festooned and tied up round the bed-place, so as to give it a very gay appearance, and also to hide the rough walls of the cottage. ""Indeed, Ready, I am much obliged to you,"" said Mrs Seagrave, when he had finished; ""it is really quite grand for this place."" ""It's the best use we can put them to now, madam,"" said Ready. ""I am afraid so,"" replied Mr Seagrave, thoughtfully. ""Ready,"" said William, after the candles were lighted, ""you once half-promised me that you would tell me your history; I wish you would tell us some of it now, as it will pass away the evening."" ""Well, William, I did say so, and I shall keep my word.  When you have heard my story, you will say that I have been very foolish in my time; and so I have; but if it proves a warning to you, it will, at all events, be of some use."" Ready then commenced his history as follows: HISTORY OF OLD READY. ""Of course, you wish to know who my father and mother were: that is soon told.  My father was the captain of a merchant vessel, which traded from South Shields to Hamburg, and my poor mother, God bless her, was the daughter of a half-pay militia captain, who died about two months after their marriage.  The property which the old gentleman had bequeathed to my mother was added to that which my father had already vested in the brig, and he then owned one-third of the vessel; the other two-thirds were the property of a very rich ship-builder and owner, of the name of Masterman.  What with the profits of the share he held of the vessel and his pay as captain, my father was well to do.  Mr Masterman, who had a very high opinion of my father, and gained much money by his exertions and good management, was present at the marriage, and when I was born, about a year afterwards, he stood for me as godfather.  Every one considered that this was a most advantageous circumstance for me, and congratulated my father and mother; for Mr Masterman was a bachelor, of nearly sixty years, without any near relations.  It is true, that he was very fond of money; but that, they said, was all the better, as he could not take it away with him when he died.  An end, however, was soon put to all their worldly ideas, for a year after I was born, my father was drowned at sea, his vessel and the whole of her crew being lost on the Texel sands; and my mother found herself a widow, with a child scarcely weaned, when she was but twenty-two years of age. ""It was supposed that my mother would still have sufficient to live upon, as the ship had been insured at two-thirds of her value; but, to the astonishment of everybody, Mr Masterman contrived to make it appear that it was his two-thirds of the vessel which had been insured."" ""What is insurance?"" inquired William. ""Insurance, my dear boy, is paying a certain sum to people who are called underwriters, that in case the vessel or cargo is lost or damaged, the loss or damage is made good to the owners of the vessel or cargo.  You pay in proportion to the risk incurred.  Supposing you wished to insure one thousand pounds on a vessel or cargo, and ten per cent was required, you would, if the vessel came home safe, pay the underwriters one hundred pounds; if, on the contrary, the vessel was lost, the underwriters would have to pay you one thousand pounds, the sum which you had insured.  I beg your pardon for the interruption, Ready."" ""No need, Mr Seagrave; we never should lose an opportunity of teaching the young.  Well, how far the assertion of Mr Masterman was correct or not, it was impossible at the time to say; but I do know that everybody cried out `shame', and that if he did deprive the widow, he had much to answer for; for the Bible says, `Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and to keep yourself unspotted in the world'.  The consequence was, that my mother had little or nothing to live upon; but she found friends who assisted her, and she worked embroidery, and contrived to get on somehow until I was eight or nine years of age.""

"""But did not your godfather come forward to the assistance of your mother?"" inquired Mr Seagrave. ""No, sir, strange to say, he did not; and that made people talk the more.  I believe it was the abuse of him, which he did not fail to hear, and which he ascribed to my mother, which turned him away from us; perhaps it was his own conscience, for we always dislike those we have injured."" ""Unfortunately, there is great truth in that remark of yours, Ready,"" observed Mr Seagrave; ""still, it is strange that he did not do something."" ""It was very strange, sir,--at least, so it appeared at the time, but he was very fond of money, and irritated at the reports and observations which were made about him.  But, to go on, sir, I was a strong, hardy boy, and, whenever I could escape from my mother or school, was always found by the water-side or on board of the vessels.  In the summer-time I was half the day in water, and was a very good swimmer.  My mother perceived my fondness for the profession, and tried all she could to divert my thoughts some other way.  She told me of the dangers and hardships which sailors went through, and always ended with my father's death and a flood of tears. ""We certainly are of a perverse nature, as I have often heard the clergyman say, for it appears to me that we always wish to do that which we are told not to do.  If my mother had not been always persuading me against going to sea, I really believe I might have stayed at home. I've often thought since, how selfish and unfeeling I must have been.  I was too young to know what pain I was giving my mother, and how anxiety was preying upon her, all on my account.  Children cannot feel it; if they did, they would do otherwise, for our hearts are seldom hard until we grow older."" ""I agree with you, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave.  ""If children really knew how much their parents suffer when they behave ill, how alarmed they are at any proofs of wickedness in them, they would be much better."" ""We never find that out, sir, till it is too late,"" continued Ready. ""Well, sir, I was little more than nine years old, when, on a very windy day, and the water rough, a hawser, by which a vessel was fast to the wharf, was carried away with a violent jerk, and the broken part, as it flew out, struck a person who was at the edge of the wharf, and knocked him into the sea.  I heard the crying out, and the men from the wharf and from the ships were throwing ropes to him, but he could not catch hold of them; indeed, he could not swim well, and the water was rough. I caught a rope that had been hauled in again, and leapt off the wharf. ""Young as I was, I swam like a duck, and put the rope into his hands just as he was going down.  He clung to it as drowning men only can cling, and was hauled to the piles, and soon afterwards a boat, which had been lowered from the stern of one of the vessels, picked us both up.  We were taken to a public-house, and put into bed till dry clothes could be sent for us; and then I found that the person I had saved was my godfather, Mr Masterman.  Everyone was loud in my praise; and, although perhaps I ought not to say it, it was a bold act for so young a boy as I was.  The sailors took me home to my mother in a sort of triumphal procession; and she, poor thing, when she heard what I had done, embraced me over and over again, one moment rejoicing at my preservation, and the next weeping bitterly at the thoughts of the danger I had encountered, and the probability that my bold spirit would lead me into still greater."" ""But she did not blame you for what you had done?"" ""Oh no, William; she felt that I had done my duty towards my neighbour, and perhaps she felt in her own heart that I had returned good for evil; but she did not say so.  The next day Mr Masterman called upon us; he certainly looked very foolish and confused when he asked for his godson, whom he had so long neglected.  My mother, who felt how useful he might be to me, received him very kindly; but I had been often told of his neglect of me and my mother, and of his supposed unfair conduct towards my father, and had taken a violent dislike to him; his advances towards me were therefore very coolly received.  I felt glad that I had saved him; but although I could not exactly understand my own feelings at the time, I am ashamed to say that my pleasure was not derived from having done a good action, so much as indulging a feeling of revenge in having put one under an obligation who had treated me ill; this arose from my proud spirit, which my mother could not check.  So you see, William, there was very little merit in what I had done, as, after I had done it, I indulged those feelings which I ought to have checked."" ""I think I could not have helped feeling the same, Ready, under such circumstances,"" replied William. ""The impulse which induced me to act was good,"" replied Ready; ""but the feeling which I indulged in afterwards took away the whole merit of the deed.  I am stating what I believe to be the truth; and an old man like me can look upon the past without bias, but not without regret.  Mr Masterman made but a short visit; he told my mother that he would now take care of me and bring me up to the business of a ship-builder as soon as I was old enough to leave school, and that in the meantime he would pay all my expenses.  My poor mother was very grateful, and shed tears of joy; and when Mr Masterman went away, she embraced me, and said that now she was happy, as I should have a profession on shore and not go to sea.  I must do justice to Mr Masterman; he kept his word and sent money to my mother, so that she became quite cheerful and comfortable, and everyone congratulated her, and she used to fondle me, and say, it was all through me that she was relieved from her distress."" ""How happy that must have made you, Ready!"" said William. ""Yes, it did, but it made me also very proud.  Strange to say, I could not conquer my dislike to Mr Masterman; I had nourished the feeling too long.  I could not bear that my mother should be under obligations to him, or that he should pay for my schooling; it hurt my foolish pride, young as I then was; and although my mother was happy, I was not. Besides, as I was put to a better school, and was obliged to remain with the other boys, I could no longer run about the wharfs, or go on board the vessels, as before.  I did not see then, as I do now, that it was all for my good but I became discontented and unhappy, merely because I was obliged to pay attention to my learning, and could no longer have my own way.  The master complained of me; and Mr Masterman called and scolded me well.  I became more disobedient, and then I was punished. This irritated me, and I made up my mind that I would run away to sea. You see, William, I was all in the wrong; and so will all boys be who think they know better than those who have charge of them; and now only see what I probably lost by my foolish conduct.  I say _probably_, for no one can calculate or foresee what is to take place; but, as far as appearances went, I had every prospect of receiving a good education--of succeeding Mr Masterman in his business, and, very probably, of inheriting his large fortune; so that I might have been at this time a rich and well-educated man, surrounded with all the comforts and luxuries of life; perhaps with an amiable wife and large family round me, to make me still happier, instead of being what I now am, a poor, worn-out old seaman upon a desert isle.  I point this out to you, William, to show how one false and foolish step in the young may affect their whole prospects in life; and, instead of enabling them to sail down with the stream of prosperity, may leave them to struggle against the current of adversity, as has been the case with me.""
