"          ""They have a pretty island,              Whereon at night they rest;            They have a sparkling lakelet,              And float upon its breast.""                           THE TWO SWANS.  Onwards quietly stepped the little procession, Houpet first, his tuft waving as usual, with a comfortable air of importance and satisfaction; then Nibble and Grignan abreast--hand-in-hand, I was going to have said; next Hugh and Jeanne; with the two attendant chickens behind bringing up the rear. ""I wonder where they are going to take us to,"" said Hugh in a low voice. Somehow the soft light; the strange loneliness of the great plain, where, now that they were accustomed to it, the rushing of the numberless water-springs seemed to be but one single, steady sound; the solemn behaviour of their curious guides, altogether, had subdued the children's spirits. Jeanne said no more about ""having fun,"" yet she did not seem the least frightened or depressed; she was only quiet and serious. ""Where _do_ you think they are going to take us to?"" repeated Hugh. ""I don't know--at least I'm not sure,"" said Jeanne; ""but, Chéri, isn't it a good thing that Houpet and the others are with us to show us the way, for though the ground looks so pretty it is quite boggy here and there. I notice that Houpet never goes quite close to the fountains, and just when I went the least bit near one a minute ago my feet began to slip down."" ""I haven't felt it like that at all,"" said Hugh. ""Perhaps it's because of my wall-climbers. Dudu gave me a pair of wall-climbers like the flies', you know, Jeanne."" ""Did he?"" said Jeanne, not at all surprised, and as if wall-climbers were no more uncommon than goloshes. ""He didn't give me any, but then I came a different way from you. I think every one comes a different way to this country, do you know, Chéri?"" ""And very likely Dudu thought I could carry you if there was anywhere you couldn't climb,"" said Hugh, importantly. ""I'm sure I----"" he stopped abruptly, for a sudden crow from Houpet had brought all the party to a standstill. At first the children could not make out why their guide had stopped here--there was nothing to be seen. But pressing forward a few steps to where Houpet stood, Hugh saw, imbedded in the moss at his feet, a stone with a ring in it, just like those which one reads of in the _Arabian Nights_. Houpet stood at the edge of the stone eyeing it gravely, and somehow he managed to make Hugh understand that he was to lift it. Nothing loth, but rather doubtful as to whether he would be strong enough, the boy leant forward to reach the ring, first whispering, however, to Jeanne, ""It's getting like a quite real fairy tale, isn't it, Jeanne?"" Jeanne nodded, but looked rather anxious. ""I'm _afraid_ you can't lift it, Chéri,"" she said. ""I think I'd better stand behind and pull _you_--the ring isn't big enough for us both to put our hands in it."" Hugh made no objection to her proposal, so Jeanne put her arms round his waist, and when he gave a great pug to the ring she gave a great pug to him. The first time it was no use, the stone did not move in the least. ""Try again,"" said Hugh, and try again they did. But no--the second try succeeded no better than the first--and the children looked at each other in perplexity. Suddenly there was a movement among the animals, who had all been standing round watching the children's attempts; Jeanne felt a sort of little pecking tug at her skirts--how it came about I cannot say, but I think I forgot to tell you that, unlike Hugh in his red flannel dressing gown, _she_ was arrayed for their adventures in her best Sunday pelisse, trimmed with fur--and, looking round, lo and behold! there was Houpet holding on to her with his beak, then came Nibble, his two front paws embracing Houpet's feathered body, Grignan behind him again, clutching with his mouth at Nibble's fur, and the two chickens at the end holding on to Grignan and each other in some indescribable and marvellous way. It was, for all the world, as if they were preparing for the finish-up part of the game of ""oranges and lemons,"" or for that of ""fox and geese!"" The sight was so comical that it was all the children could do to keep their gravity, they succeeded in doing so, however, fearing that it might hurt the animals' feelings to seem to make fun of their well-meant efforts. ""Not that _they_ can be any use,"" whispered Hugh, ""but it's very good-natured of them all the same."" ""I am not so sure that they can't be of any use,"" returned Jeanne. ""Think of how well Houpet drove."" ""Here goes, then,"" said Hugh. ""One, two, _three_;"" and with ""three"" he gave a tremendous tug--a much more tremendous tug than was required, for, to his surprise, the stone yielded at once without the slightest resistance, and back they all fell, one on the top of the other, Hugh, Jeanne, Houpet, Nibble, Grignan, and the two chickens! But none of them were any the worse, and with the greatest eagerness to see what was to be seen where the stone had been, up jumped Hugh and Jeanne and ran forward to the spot. ""There should be,"" said Jeanne, half out of breath--""there _should_ be a little staircase for us to go down, if it is like the stories in the _Arabian Nights_."" And, wonderful to relate, so there was! The children could hardly believe their eyes, when below them they saw the most tempting little spiral staircase of white stone or marble steps, with a neat little brass balustrade at one side. It looked quite light all the way down, though of course they could distinguish nothing at the bottom, as the corkscrew twists of the staircase entirely filled up the space. Houpet hopped forward and stood at the top of the steps crowing softly. ""He means that we're to go down,"" said Hugh. ""Shall we?"" ""Of course,"" said Jeanne. ""I'm not a bit afraid. We won't have any fun if we don't go on."" ""Well then,"" said Hugh, ""I'll go first as I'm a boy, just _in case_, you know, Jeanne, of our meeting anything disagreeable."" So down he went, Jeanne following close after. ""I suppose Houpet and the others will come after us,"" said Jeanne, rather anxiously. But just as she uttered the words a rather shrill crow made both Hugh and her stop short and look up to the top. They saw Houpet and the others standing round the edge of the hole. Houpet gave another crow, in which the two chickens joined him, and then suddenly the stone was shut down--the two children found themselves alone in this strange place, leading to they knew not where! Jeanne gave a little cry--Hugh, too, for a moment was rather startled, but he soon recovered himself. ""Jeanne,"" he said, ""it must be all right. I don't think we need be frightened. See, it is quite light! The light comes up from below--down there it must be quite bright and cheerful. Give me your hand--if we go down sideways--so--we can hold each other's hands all the way."" So, in a rather queer fashion, they clambered down the long staircase. By the time they got to its end they were really quite tired of turning round and round so many times. But now the view before them was so pleasant that they forgot all their troubles. They had found a little door at the foot of the stair, which opened easily. They passed through it, and there lay before them a beautiful expanse of water surrounded by hills; the door which had closed behind them seemed on this side to have been cut out of the turf of the hill, and was all but invisible. It was light, as Hugh had said, but not with the light of either sun or moon; a soft radiance was over everything, but whence it came they could not tell. The hills on each side of the water, which was more like a calmly flowing river than a lake, prevented their seeing very far, but close to the shore by which they stood a little boat was moored--a little boat with seats for two, and one light pair of oars.

"""Oh, how lovely!"" said Jeanne. ""It is even nicer than the carriage. Get in, Hugh, and let us row down the river. The boat must be on purpose for us."" They were soon settled in it, and Hugh, though he had only rowed once or twice before in his life, found it very easy and pleasant, and they went over the water swiftly and smoothly. After a while the hills approached more nearly, gradually the broad river dwindled to a mere stream, so narrow and small at last, that even their tiny boat could go no farther. Hugh was forced to leave off rowing. ""I suppose we are meant to go on shore here,"" he said. ""The boat won't go any farther, any way."" Jeanne was peering forward: just before them the brook, or what still remained of it, almost disappeared in a narrow little gorge between the hills. ""Chéri,"" said she, ""I shouldn't wonder if the stream gets wider again on the other side of this little narrow place. Don't you think we'd better try to pull the boat through, and then we might get into it again?"" ""Perhaps,"" said Hugh. ""We may try."" So out the children got--Jeanne pulled in front, Hugh pushed behind. It was so very light that there was no difficulty as to its weight; only the gorge was so narrow that at last the boat stuck fast. ""We'd better leave it and clamber through ourselves,"" said Hugh. ""But, O Chéri, we can't!"" cried Jeanne. ""From where I am I can see that the water gets wider again a little farther on. And the rocks come quite sharp down to the side. There is nowhere we could clamber on to, and I dare say the water is very deep. There are lots of little streams trickling into it from the rocks, and the boat could go quite well if we could but get it a little farther."" ""But we can't,"" said Hugh; ""it just won't go."" ""Oh dear,"" said Jeanne, ""we'll have to go back. But how should we find the door in the hillside to go up the stair; or if we did get up, how should we push away the stone? And even then, there would be the forest to go through, and perhaps we couldn't find our way among the trees as Houpet did. O Chéri, what shall we do?"" Hugh stood still and considered. ""I think,"" he said at last, ""I think the time's come for whistling."" And before Jeanne could ask him what he meant, he gave three clear, short whistles, and then waited to see the effect. It was a most unexpected one. Hugh had anticipated nothing else than the sudden appearance, somehow and somewhere, of Monsieur Dudu himself, as large as life--possibly, in this queer country of surprises, where they found themselves, a little larger! When and how he would appear Hugh was perfectly at a loss to imagine--he might fly down from the sky; he might spring up from the water; he might just suddenly stand before them without their having any idea how he had come. Hugh laughed to himself at the thought of Jeanne's astonishment, and after all it was Jeanne who first drew his attention to what was really happening. ""Hark, Chéri, hark!"" she cried, ""what a queer noise! What can it be?"" Hugh's attention had been so taken up in staring about in every direction for the raven that he had not noticed the sound which Jeanne had heard, and which now increased every moment. It was a soft, swishy sound--as if innumerable little boats were making their way through water, or as if innumerable little fairies were bathing themselves, only every instant it came nearer and nearer, till at last, on every side of the boat in which the children were still standing, came creeping up from below lots and lots and _lots_ of small, bright green frogs, who clambered over the sides and arranged themselves in lines along the edges in the most methodical and orderly manner. Jeanne gave a scream of horror, and darted across the boat to where Hugh was standing. ""O Chéri,"" she cried, ""why did you whistle? It's all that naughty Dudu. He's going to turn us into frogs too, I do believe, because he thinks I laughed at him. Oh dear, oh dear, what shall we do?"" Chéri himself, though not quite so frightened as Jeanne, was not much pleased with the result of his summons to the raven. ""It does look like a shabby trick,"" he said; ""but still I do not think the creatures mean to do us any harm. And I don't feel myself being turned into a frog yet; do you, Jeanne?"" ""I don't know,"" said Jeanne, a very little comforted; ""I don't know what it would feel like to be turned into a frog; I've always been a little girl, and so I can't tell. I feel rather creepy and chilly, but perhaps it's only with seeing the frogs. What funny red eyes they've got. What can they be going to do?"" She forgot her fears in the interest of watching them; Hugh, too, stared with all his eyes at the frogs, who, arranged in regular lines round the edge of the boat, began working away industriously at something which, for a minute or two, the children could not make out. At last Jeanne called out eagerly, ""They are throwing over little lines, Chéri--lots and lots of little lines. There must be frogs down below waiting to catch them."" So it was; each frog threw over several threads which he seemed to unwind from his body; these threads were caught by something invisible down below, and twisted round and round several times, till at last they became as firm and strong as a fine twine. And when, apparently, the frogs considered that they had made cables enough, they settled themselves down, each firmly on his two hind legs, still holding by the rope with their front ones, and then--in another moment--to the children's great delight, they felt the boat beginning to move. It moved on smoothly--almost as smoothly as when on the water--there were no jogs or tugs, as might have been the case if it had been pulled by two or three coarse, strong ropes, for all the hundreds of tiny cables pulling together made one even force. ""Why, how clever they are!"" cried Jeanne. ""We go as smoothly as if we were on wheels. Nice little frogs. I am sure we are very much obliged to them--aren't we, Chéri?"" ""And to Dudu,"" observed Hugh. Jeanne shrugged her shoulders. She was not over and above sure of Dudu even now. The boat moved along for some time; the pass between the hills was dark and gloomy, and though the water got wider, as Jeanne had seen, it would not for some distance have been possible for the children to row. After a time it suddenly grew much lighter; they came out from the narrow pass and found themselves but a few yards from a sheet of still water with trees all round it--a sort of mountain lake it seemed, silent and solitary, and reflecting back from its calm bosom the soft, silvery, even radiance which since they came out from the door on the hillside had been the children's only light. And in the middle of this lake lay a little island--a perfect nest of trees, whose long drooping branches hung down into the water. ""Oh, do let us row on to the island,"" said Jeanne eagerly, for by this time the frogs had drawn them to the edge of the lake; there could no longer be any difficulty in rowing for themselves. ""First, any way, we must thank the frogs,"" said Hugh, standing up. He would have taken off his cap if he had had one on; as it was, he could only bow politely. As he did so, each frog turned round so as to face him, and each gave a little bob of the head, which, though not very graceful, was evidently meant as an acknowledgment of Hugh's courtesy. ""They are very polite frogs,"" whispered Hugh. ""Jeanne, do stand up and bow to them too."" Jeanne, who all this time had been sitting with her feet tucked up under her, showed no inclination to move. ""I don't like to stand up,"" she said, ""for fear the frogs should run up my legs. But I can thank them just as well sitting down. Frogs,"" she added, ""frogs, I am very much obliged to you, and I hope you will excuse my not standing up.""
