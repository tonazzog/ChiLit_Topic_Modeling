"CHAPTER XIV. ""SINCE THERE'S NO HELP, COME, LET US KISS AND PART!""  As soon as the Professor seemed to have regained his faculties, Horace opened the door and called in Sylvia and her mother, who were, as was only to be expected, overcome with joy on seeing the head of the family released from his ignoble condition of a singularly ill-favoured quadruped. ""There, there,"" said the Professor, as he submitted to their embraces and incoherent congratulations, ""it's nothing to make a fuss about. I'm quite myself again, as you can see. And,"" he added, with an unreasonable outburst of ill-temper, ""if one of you had only had the common sense to think of such a simple remedy as sprinkling a little cold water over me when I was first taken like that, I should have been spared a great deal of unnecessary inconvenience. But that's always the way with women--lose their heads the moment anything goes wrong! If I had not kept perfectly cool myself--"" ""It was very, very stupid of us not to think of it, papa,"" said Sylvia, tactfully ignoring the fact that there was scarcely an undamaged article in the room; ""still, you know, if _we_ had thrown the water it mightn't have had the same effect."" ""I'm not in a condition to argue now,"" said her father; ""you didn't trouble to try it, and there's no more to be said."" ""No more to be said!"" exclaimed Fakrash. ""O thou monster of ingratitude, hast thou no thanks for him who hath delivered thee from thy predicament?"" ""As I am already indebted to you, sir,"" said the Professor, ""for about twenty-four hours of the most poignant and humiliating mental and bodily anguish a human being can endure, inflicted for no valid reason that I can discover, except the wanton indulgence of your unholy powers, I can only say that any gratitude of which I am conscious is of a very qualified description. As for you, Ventimore,"" he added, turning to Horace, ""I don't know--I can only guess at--the part you have played in this wretched business; but in any case you will understand, once for all, that all relations between us must cease."" ""Papa,"" said Sylvia, tremulously, ""Horace and I have already agreed that--that we must separate."" ""At my bidding,"" explained Fakrash, suavely; ""for such an alliance would be totally unworthy of his merits and condition."" This frankness was rather too much for the Professor, whose temper had not been improved by his recent trials. ""Nobody asked for your opinion, sir!"" he snapped. ""A person who has only recently been released from a term of long and, from all I have been able to ascertain, well-deserved imprisonment, is scarcely entitled to pose as an authority on social rank. Have the decency not to interfere again with my domestic affairs."" ""Excellent is the saying,"" remarked the imperturbable Jinnee, ""'Let the rat that is between the paws of the leopard observe rigidly all the rules of politeness and refrain from words of provocation.' For to return thee to the form of a mule once more would be no difficult undertaking."" ""I think I failed to make myself clear,"" the Professor hastened to observe--""failed to make myself clear. I--I merely meant to congratulate you on your fortunate escape from the consequences of what I--I don't doubt was an error of justice. I--I am sure that, in the future, you will employ your--your very remarkable abilities to better purpose, and I would suggest that the greatest service you can do this unfortunate young man here is to abstain from any further attempts to promote his interests."" ""Hear, hear!"" Horace could not help throwing in, though in so discreet an undertone that it was inaudible. ""Far be this from me,"" replied Fakrash. ""For he has become unto me even as a favourite son, whom I design to place upon the golden pinnacle of felicity. Therefore, I have chosen for him a wife, who is unto this damsel of thine as the full moon to the glow-worm, and as the bird of Paradise to an unfledged sparrow. And the nuptials shall be celebrated before many hours."" ""Horace!"" cried Sylvia, justly incensed, ""why--_why_ didn't you tell me this before?"" ""Because,"" said the unhappy Horace, ""this is the very first I've heard of it. He's always springing some fresh surprise on me,"" he added, in a whisper--""but they never come to anything much. And he can't marry me against my will, you know."" ""No,"" said Sylvia, biting her lip. ""I never supposed he could do that, Horace."" ""I'll settle this at once,"" he replied. ""Now, look here, Mr. Jinnee,"" he added, ""I don't know what new scheme you have got in your head--but if you are proposing to marry me to anybody in particular----"" ""Have I not informed thee that I have it in contemplation to obtain for thee the hand of a King's daughter of marvellous beauty and accomplishments?"" ""You know perfectly well you never mentioned it before,"" said Horace, while Sylvia gave a little low cry. ""Repine not, O damsel,"" counselled the Jinnee, ""since it is for his welfare. For, though as yet he believeth it not, when he beholds the resplendent beauty of her countenance he will swoon away with delight and forget thy very existence."" ""I shall do nothing of the sort,"" said Horace, savagely. ""Just understand that I don't intend to marry any Princess. You may prevent me--in fact, you _have_--from marrying this lady, but you can't force me to marry anybody else. I defy you!"" ""When thou hast seen thy bride's perfections thou wilt need no compulsion,"" said Fakrash. ""And if thou shouldst refuse, know this: that thou wilt be exposing those who are dear to thee in this household to calamities of the most unfortunate description."" The awful vagueness of this threat completely crushed Horace; he could not think, he did not even dare to imagine, what consequences he might bring upon his beloved Sylvia and her helpless parents by persisting in his refusal. ""Give me time,"" he said heavily; ""I want to talk this over with you."" ""Pardon me, Ventimore,"" said the Professor, with acidulous politeness; ""but, interesting as the discussion of your matrimonial arrangements is to you and your--a--protector, I should greatly prefer that you choose some more fitting place for arriving at a decision which is in the circumstances a foregone conclusion. I am rather tired and upset, and I should be obliged if you and this gentleman could bring this most trying interview to a close as soon as you conveniently can."" ""You hear, Mr. Fakrash?"" said Horace, between his teeth, ""it is quite time we left. If you go at once, I will follow you very shortly."" ""Thou wilt find me awaiting thee,"" answered the Jinnee, and, to Mrs. Futvoye's and Sylvia's alarm, disappeared through one of the bookcases. ""Well,"" said Horace, gloomily, ""you see how I'm situated? That obstinate old devil has cornered me. I'm done for!"" ""Don't say that,"" said the Professor; ""you appear to be on the eve of a most brilliant alliance, in which I am sure you have our best wishes--the best wishes of us all,"" he added pointedly. ""Sylvia,"" said Horace, still lingering, ""before I go, tell me that, whatever I may have to do, you will understand that--that it will be for your sake!"" ""Please don't talk like that,"" she said. ""We may never see one another again. Don't let my last recollection of you be of--of a hypocrite, Horace!"" ""A hypocrite!"" he cried. ""Sylvia, this is too much! What have I said or done to make you think me that?"" ""Oh, I am not so simple as you suppose, Horace,"" she replied. ""I see now why all this has happened: why poor dad was tormented; why you insisted on my setting you free. But I would have released you without _that_! Indeed, all this elaborate artifice wasn't in the least necessary!"" ""You believe I was an accomplice in that old fool's plot?"" he said. ""You believe me such a cur as that?"" ""I don't blame you,"" she said. ""I don't believe you could help yourself. He can make you do whatever he chooses. And then, you are so rich now, it is natural that you should want to marry some one--some one more suited to you--like this lovely Princess of yours.""

"""Of mine!"" groaned the exasperated Horace. ""When I tell you I've never even seen her! As if any Princess in the world would marry me to please a Jinnee out of a brass bottle! And if she did, Sylvia, you can't believe that any Princess would make me forget you!"" ""It depends so very much on the Princess,"" was all Sylvia could be induced to say. ""Well,"" said Horace, ""if that's all the faith you have in me, I suppose it's useless to say any more. Good-bye, Mrs. Futvoye; good-bye, Professor. I wish I could tell you how deeply I regret all the trouble I have brought on you by my own folly. All I can say is, that I will bear anything in future rather than expose you or any of you to the smallest risk."" ""I trust, indeed,"" said the Professor, stiffly, ""that you will use all the influence at your command to secure me from any repetition of an experience that might well have unmanned a less equable temperament than my own."" ""Good-bye, Horace,"" said Mrs. Futvoye, more kindly. ""I believe you are more to be pitied than blamed, whatever others may think. And _I_ don't forget--if Anthony does--that, but for you, he might, instead of sitting there comfortably in his armchair, be lashing out with his hind legs and kicking everything to pieces at this very moment!"" ""I deny that I lashed out!"" said the Professor. ""My--a--hind quarters may have been under imperfect control--but I never lost my reasoning powers or my good humour for a single instant. I can say that truthfully."" If the Professor could say that truthfully amidst the general wreck in which he sat, like another Marius, he had little to learn in the gentle art of self-deception; but there was nothing to gain by contradicting him then. ""Good-bye, Sylvia,"" said Horace, and held out his hand. ""Good-bye,"" she said, without offering to take it or look at him--and, after a miserable pause, he left the study. But before he had reached the front door he heard a swish and swirl of drapery behind him, and felt her light hand on his arm. ""Ah, no!"" she said, clinging to him, ""I can't let you go like this. I didn't mean all the things I said just now. I _do_ believe in you, Horace--at least, I'll try hard to.... And I shall always, _always_ love you, Horace.... I shan't care--very much--even if you do forget me, so long as you are happy.... Only don't be _too_ happy. Think of me sometimes!"" ""I shall _not_ be too happy,"" he said, as he held her close to his heart and kissed her pathetically drawn mouth and flushed cheeks. ""And I shall think of you always."" ""And you won't fall in love with your Princess?"" entreated Sylvia, at the end of her altruism. ""Promise!"" ""If I am ever provided with one,"" he replied, ""I shall loathe her--for not being you. But don't let us lose heart, darling. There must be some way of talking that old idiot out of this nonsense and bringing him round to common sense. I'm not going to give in just yet!"" These were brave words--but, as they both felt, the situation had little enough to warrant them, and, after one last long embrace, they parted, and he was no sooner on the steps than he felt himself caught up as before and borne through the air with breathless speed, till he was set down, he could not have well said how, in a chair in his own sitting-room at Vincent Square. ""Well,"" he said, looking at the Jinnee, who was standing opposite with a smile of intolerable complacency, ""I suppose you feel satisfied with yourself over this business?"" ""It hath indeed been brought to a favourable conclusion,"" said Fakrash. ""Well hath the poet written----"" ""I don't think I can stand any more 'Elegant Extracts' this afternoon,"" interrupted Horace. ""Let us come to business. You seem,"" he went on, with a strong effort to keep himself in hand, ""to have formed some plan for marrying me to a King's daughter. May I ask you for full particulars?"" ""No honour and advancement can be in excess of thy deserts,"" answered the Jinnee. ""Very kind of you to say so--but you are probably unaware that, as society is constituted at the present time, the objections to such an alliance would be quite insuperable."" ""For me,"" said the Jinnee, ""few obstacles are insuperable. But speak thy mind freely."" ""I will,"" said Horace. ""To begin with, no European Princess of the Blood Royal would entertain the idea for a moment. And if she did, she would forfeit her rank and cease to be a Princess, and I should probably be imprisoned in a fortress for _lèse majesté_ or something."" ""Dismiss thy fears, for I do not propose to unite thee to any Princess that is born of mortals. The bride I intend for thee is a Jinneeyeh; the peerless Bedeea-el-Jemal, daughter of my kinsman Shahyal, the Ruler of the Blue Jann."" ""Oh, is she, though?"" said Horace, blankly. ""I'm exceedingly obliged, but, whatever may be the lady's attractions----"" ""Her nose,"" recited the Jinnee, with enthusiasm, ""is like unto the keen edge of a polished sword; her hair resembleth jewels, and her cheeks are ruddy as wine. She hath heavy lips, and when she looketh aside she putteth to shame the wild cows...."" ""My good, excellent friend,"" said Horace, by no means impressed by this catalogue of charms, ""one doesn't marry to mortify wild cows."" ""When she walketh with a vacillating gait,"" continued Fakrash, as though he had not been interrupted, ""the willow branch itself turneth green with envy."" ""Personally,"" said Horace, ""a waddle doesn't strike me as particularly fascinating--it's quite a matter of taste. Do you happen to have seen this enchantress lately?"" ""My eyes have not been refreshed by her manifold beauties since I was enclosed by Suleyman--whose name be accursed--in the brass bottle of which thou knowest. Why dost thou ask?"" ""Merely because it occurred to me that, after very nearly three thousand years, your charming kinswoman may--well, to put it as mildly as possible, not have altogether escaped the usual effects of Time. I mean, she must be getting on, you know!"" ""O, silly-bearded one!"" said the Jinnee, in half-scornful rebuke; ""art thou, then, ignorant that we of the Jinn are not as mortals, that we should feel the ravages of age?"" ""Forgive me if I'm personal,"" said Horace; ""but surely your own hair and beard might be described as rather inclining to grey."" ""Not from age,"" said Fakrash, ""This cometh from long confinement."" ""I see,"" said Horace. ""Like the Prisoner of Chillon. Well, assuming that the lady in question is still in the bloom of early youth, I see one fatal difficulty to becoming her suitor."" ""Doubtless,"" said the Jinnee, ""thou art referring to Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees?"" ""No, I wasn't,"" said Horace; ""because, you see, I don't remember having ever heard of him. However, he's _another_ fatal difficulty. That makes two of them."" ""Surely I have spoken of him to thee as my deadliest foe? It is true that he is a powerful and vindictive Efreet, who hath long persecuted the beauteous Bedeea with hateful attentions. Yet it may be possible, by good fortune, to overthrow him."" ""Then I gather that any suitor for Bedeea's hand would be looked upon as a rival by the amiable Jarjarees?"" ""Far is he from being of an amiable disposition,"" answered the Jinnee, simply, ""and he would be so transported by rage and jealousy that he would certainly challenge thee to mortal combat."" ""Then that settles it,"" said Horace. ""I don't think any one can fairly call me a coward, but I do draw the line at fighting an Efreet for the hand of a lady I've never seen. How do I know he'll fight fair?"" ""He would probably appear unto thee first in the form of a lion, and if he could not thus prevail against thee, transform himself into a serpent, and then into a buffalo or some other wild beast."" ""And I should have to tackle the entire menagerie?"" said Horace. ""Why, my dear sir, I should never get beyond the lion!"" ""I would assist thee to assume similar transformations,"" said the Jinnee, ""and thus thou mayst be enabled to defeat him. For I burn with desire to behold mine enemy reduced to cinders.""

"""It's much more likely that you would have to sweep _me_ up!"" said Horace, who had a strong conviction that anything in which the Jinnee was concerned would be bungled somehow. ""And if you're so anxious to destroy this Jarjarees, why don't you challenge him to meet you in some quiet place in the desert and settle him yourself? It's much more in your line than it is in mine!"" He was not without hopes that Fakrash might act on this suggestion, and that so he would be relieved of him in the simplest and most satisfactory way; but any such hopes were as usual doomed to disappointment. ""It would be of no avail,"" said the Jinnee, ""for it hath been written of old that Jarjarees shall not perish save by the hand of a mortal. And I am persuaded that thou wilt turn out to be that mortal, since thou art both strong and fearless, and, moreover, it is also predestined that Bedeea shall wed one of the sons of men."" ""Then,"" said Horace, feeling that this line of defence must be abandoned, ""I fall back on objection number one. Even if Jarjarees were obliging enough to retire in my favour, I should still decline to become the--a--consort of a Jinneeyeh whom I've never seen, and don't love."" ""Thou hast heard of her incomparable charms, and verily the ear may love before the eye."" ""It may,"" admitted Horace, ""but neither of _my_ ears is the least in love at present."" ""These reasons are of no value,"" said Fakrash, ""and if thou hast none better----"" ""Well,"" said Ventimore, ""I think I have. You profess to be anxious to--to requite the trifling service I rendered you, though hitherto, you'll admit yourself, you haven't made a very brilliant success of it. But, putting the past aside,"" he continued, with a sudden dryness in his throat; ""putting the past aside, I ask you to consider what possible benefit or happiness such a match as this--I'm afraid I'm not so fortunate as to secure your attention?"" he broke off, as he observed the Jinnee's eyes beginning to film over in the disagreeable manner characteristic of certain birds. ""Proceed,"" said Fakrash, unskinning his eyes for a second; ""I am hearkening unto thee."" ""It seems to me,"" stammered Horace, inconsequently enough, ""that all that time inside a bottle--well, you can't call it _experience_ exactly; and possibly in the interval you've forgotten all you knew about feminine nature. I think you _must_ have."" ""It is not possible that such knowledge should be forgotten,"" said the Jinnee, resenting this imputation in quite a human way. ""Thy words appear to me to lack sense. Interpret them, I pray thee."" ""Why,"" explained Horace, ""you don't mean to tell me that this young and lovely relation of yours, a kind of immortal, and--and with the devil's own pride, would be gratified by your proposal to bestow her hand upon an insignificant and unsuccessful London architect? She'd turn up that sharp and polished nose of hers at the mere idea of so unequal a match!"" ""An excellent rank is that conferred by wealth,"" remarked the Jinnee. ""But I'm _not_ rich, and I've already declined any riches from you,"" said Horace. ""And, what's more to the point, I'm perfectly and hopelessly obscure. If you had the slightest sense of humour--which I fear you have not--you would at once perceive the absurdity of proposing to unite a radiant, ethereal, superhuman being to a commonplace professional nonentity in a morning coat and a tall hat. It's really too ridiculous!"" ""What thou hast just said is not altogether without wisdom,"" said Fakrash, to whom this was evidently a new point of view. ""Art thou, indeed, so utterly unknown?"" ""Unknown?"" repeated Horace; ""I should rather think I was! I'm simply an inconsiderable unit in the population of the vastest city in the world; or, rather, not a unit--a cipher. And, don't you see, a man to be worthy of your exalted kinswoman ought to be a celebrity. There are plenty of them about."" ""What meanest thou by a celebrity?"" inquired Fakrash, falling into the trap more readily than Horace had ventured to hope. ""Oh, well, a distinguished person, whose name is on everybody's lips, who is honoured and praised by all his fellow-citizens. Now, _that_ kind of man no Jinneeyeh could look down upon."" ""I perceive,"" said Fakrash, thoughtfully. ""Yes, I was in danger of committing a rash action. How do men honour such distinguished individuals in these days?"" ""They generally overfeed them,"" said Horace. ""In London the highest honour a hero can be paid is to receive the freedom of the City, which is only conferred in very exceptional cases, and for some notable service. But, of course, there are other sorts of celebrities, as you could see if you glanced through the society papers."" ""I cannot believe that thou, who seemest a gracious and talented young man, can be indeed so obscure as thou hast represented."" ""My good sir, any of the flowers that blush unseen in the desert air, or the gems concealed in ocean caves, so excellently described by one of our poets, could give me points and a beating in the matter of notoriety. I'll make you a sporting offer. There are over five million inhabitants in this London of ours. If you go out into the streets and ask the first five hundred you meet whether they know me, I don't mind betting you--what shall I say? a new hat--that you won't find half a dozen who've ever even heard of my existence. Why not go out and see for yourself?"" To his surprise and gratification the Jinnee took this seriously. ""I will go forth and make inquiry,"" he said, ""for I desire further enlightenment concerning thy statements. But, remember,"" he added: ""should I still require thee to wed the matchless Bedeea-el-Jemal, and thou shouldst disobey me, thou wilt bring disaster, not on thine own head, but on those thou art most desirous of protecting."" ""Yes, so you told me before,"" said Horace, brusquely. ""Good evening."" But Fakrash was already gone. In spite of all he had gone through and the unknown difficulties before him, Ventimore was seized with what Uncle Remus calls ""a spell of the dry grins"" at the thought of the probable replies that the Jinnee would meet with in the course of his inquiries. ""I'm afraid he won't be particularly impressed by the politeness of a London crowd,"" he thought; ""but at least they'll convince him that I am not exactly a prominent citizen. Then he'll give up this idiotic match of his--I don't know, though. He's such a pig-headed old fool that he may stick to it all the same. I may find myself encumbered with a Jinneeyeh bride several centuries my senior before I know where I am. No, I forget; there's the jealous Jarjarees to be polished off first. I seem to remember something about a quick-change combat with an Efreet in the ""Arabian Nights."" I may as well look it up, and see what may be in store for me."" And after dinner he went to his shelves and took down Lane's three-volume edition of ""The Arabian Nights,"" which he set himself to study with a new interest. It was long since he had looked into these wondrous tales, old beyond all human calculation, and fresher, even now, than the most modern of successful romances. After all, he was tempted to think, they might possess quite as much historical value as many works with graver pretentions to accuracy. He found a full account of the combat with the Efreet in ""The Story of the Second Royal Mendicant"" in the first volume, and was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the Efreet's name was actually given as ""Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees""--evidently the same person to whom Fakrash had referred as his bitterest foe. He was described as ""of hideous aspect,"" and had, it seemed, not only carried off the daughter of the Lord of the Ebony Island on her wedding night, but, on discovering her in the society of the Royal Mendicant, had revenged himself by striking off her hands, her feet, and her head, and transforming his human rival into an ape. ""Between this fellow and old Fakrash,"" he reflected ruefully, at this point, ""I seem likely to have a fairly lively time of it!""
