"CHAPTER VII. THE CATHEDRAL  I MUST not go on describing what cannot be described, for nothing is more wearisome. Before they reached the sea, Diamond felt North Wind’s hair just beginning to fall about him. “Is the storm over, North Wind?” he called out. “No, Diamond. I am only waiting a moment to set you down. You would not like to see the ship sunk, and I am going to give you a place to stop in till I come back for you.” “Oh! thank you,” said Diamond. “I shall be sorry to leave you, North Wind, but I would rather not see the ship go down. And I’m afraid the poor people will cry, and I should hear them. Oh, dear!” “There are a good many passengers on board; and to tell the truth, Diamond, I don’t care about your hearing the cry you speak of. I am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time.” “But how can you bear it then, North Wind? For I am sure you are kind. I shall never doubt that again.” “I will tell you how I am able to bear it, Diamond: I am always hearing, through every noise, through all the noise I am making myself even, the sound of a far-off song. I do not exactly know where it is, or what it means; and I don’t hear much of it, only the odour of its music, as it were, flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which I make such a storm; but what I do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship. So it would you if you could hear it.” “No, it wouldn’t,” returned Diamond, stoutly. “For they wouldn’t hear the music of the far-away song; and if they did, it wouldn’t do them any good. You see you and I are not going to be drowned, and so we might enjoy it.” “But you have never heard the psalm, and you don’t know what it is like. Somehow, I can’t say how, it tells me that all is right; that it is coming to swallow up all cries.” “But that won’t do them any good--the people, I mean,” persisted Diamond. “It must. It must,” said North Wind, hurriedly. “It wouldn’t be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too, and set them singing it themselves with the rest. I am sure it will. And do you know, ever since I knew I had hair, that is, ever since it began to go out and away, that song has been coming nearer and nearer. Only I must say it was some thousand years before I heard it.” “But how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it?”  asked doubting little Diamond. “Since I began to hear it, I know it is growing louder, therefore I judge it was coming nearer and nearer until I did hear it first. I’m not so very old, you know--a few thousand years only--and I was quite a baby when I heard the noise first, but I knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than I was. I can’t sing at all, except now and then, and I can never tell what my song is going to be; I only know what it is after I have sung it.--But this will never do. Will you stop here?” “I can’t see anywhere to stop,” said Diamond. “Your hair is all down like a darkness, and I can’t see through it if I knock my eyes into it ever so much.” “Look, then,” said North Wind; and, with one sweep of her great white arm, she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy. And lo! it was a blue night, lit up with stars. Where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars, except where, just opposite to Diamond’s face, the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars. “Oh! what’s that?” cried Diamond, struck with a kind of terror, for he had never seen a cathedral, and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces, conquering emptiness with grandeur. “A very good place for you to wait in,” said North Wind. “But we shall go in, and you shall judge for yourself.” There was an open door in the middle of one of the towers, leading out upon the roof, and through it they passed. Then North Wind set Diamond on his feet, and he found himself at the top of a stone stair, which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door. It was enough, however, to allow Diamond to see that North Wind stood beside him. He looked up to find her face, and saw that she was no longer a beautiful giantess, but the tall gracious lady he liked best to see. She took his hand, and, giving him the broad part of the spiral stair to walk on, led him down a good way; then, opening another little door, led him out upon a narrow gallery that ran all round the central part of the church, on the ledges of the windows of the clerestory, and through openings in the parts of the wall that divided the windows from each other. It was very narrow, and except when they were passing through the wall, Diamond saw nothing to keep him from falling into the church. It lay below him like a great silent gulf hollowed in stone, and he held his breath for fear as he looked down. “What are you trembling for, little Diamond?” said the lady, as she walked gently along, with her hand held out behind her leading him, for there was not breadth enough for them to walk side by side. “I am afraid of falling down there,” answered Diamond. “It is so deep down.” “Yes, rather,” answered North Wind; “but you were a hundred times higher a few minutes ago.” “Ah, yes, but somebody’s arm was about me then,” said Diamond, putting his little mouth to the beautiful cold hand that had a hold of his. “What a dear little warm mouth you’ve got!” said North Wind. “It is a pity you should talk nonsense with it. Don’t you know I have a hold of you?” “Yes; but I’m walking on my own legs, and they might slip. I can’t trust myself so well as your arms.” “But I have a hold of you, I tell you, foolish child.” “Yes, but somehow I can’t feel comfortable.” “If you were to fall, and my hold of you were to give way, I should be down after you in a less moment than a lady’s watch can tick, and catch you long before you had reached the ground.” “I don’t like it though,” said Diamond. “Oh! oh! oh!” he screamed the next moment, bent double with terror, for North Wind had let go her hold of his hand, and had vanished, leaving him standing as if rooted to the gallery. She left the words, “Come after me,” sounding in his ears. But move he dared not. In a moment more he would from very terror have fallen into the church, but suddenly there came a gentle breath of cool wind upon his face, and it kept blowing upon him in little puffs, and at every puff Diamond felt his faintness going away, and his fear with it. Courage was reviving in his little heart, and still the cool wafts of the soft wind breathed upon him, and the soft wind was so mighty and strong within its gentleness, that in a minute more Diamond was marching along the narrow ledge as fearless for the time as North Wind herself. He walked on and on, with the windows all in a row on one side of him, and the great empty nave of the church echoing to every one of his brave strides on the other, until at last he came to a little open door, from which a broader stair led him down and down and down, till at last all at once he found himself in the arms of North Wind, who held him close to her, and kissed him on the forehead. Diamond nestled to her, and murmured into her bosom,--“Why did you leave me, dear North Wind?” “Because I wanted you to walk alone,” she answered. “But it is so much nicer here!” said Diamond. “I daresay; but I couldn’t hold a little coward to my heart. It would make me so cold!” ",cathedral describe describe wearisome reach sea feel hair begin fall storm call wait moment set like ship sink give place stop thank sorry leave ship afraid poor person cry hear dear many passenger board truth care hearing cry speak afraid head long time bear sure kind doubt able bear hear noise noise sound song mean hear much odour music flit great billow ocean air storm hear enough able bear cry drown ship hear return hear music song drown enjoy hear psalm right swallow cry person mean persist song seem swallow fear pain set sing rest sure hair begin song nearer nearer year hear hear ask doub begin hear grow louder judge nearer hear old few year baby hear noise voice person old wise sing song sung stop stop hair darkness knock eye sweep great white arm sweep yard deep darkness great curtain face boy blue night light star shine star shimmer milk star face grey tower cathedral blote own shape sky star cry strike kind terror cathedral rise awful reality midst wide space conquer emptiness grandeur place wait judge open door middle tower lead roof pass set foot find top stone stair twist darkness light door enough allow stand find face beautiful giantess tall gracious lady like hand give broad part spiral stair walk lead way open door lead narrow gallery run central part church ledge window clerestory opening part wall divide window other narrow pass wall keep fall church lay great silent gulf hollow stone hold breath fear tremble lady walk hand hold lead breadth walk side side afraid fall answer deep answer time high few minute arm put mouth beautiful cold hand hold dear warm mouth pity talk nonsense hold walk own leg slip trust arm hold foolish child feel comfortable fall hold give way less moment lady watch tick catch reach ground like scream next moment bend double terror let hold hand vanish leave stand root gallery leave word sound ear move dare moment more terror fall church gentle breath cool wind face keep blow puff puff feel faintness fear courage revive heart cool waft soft wind breathe soft wind mighty strong gentleness minute more march narrow ledge fearless time walk window row side great empty nave church echoing one brave stride other last open door broad stair lead last find arm hold kiss forehead nestle murmure bosom leave dear want walk answer nice hold coward heart cold
