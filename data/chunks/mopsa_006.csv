"CHAPTER VI. THE TOWN WITH NOBODY IN IT.   ""Master,"" quoth the auld hound,     ""Where will ye go?""   ""Over moss, over muir.     To court my new jo.""   ""Master, though the night be merk,     I'se follow through the snow.   ""Court her, master, court her,     So shall ye do weel;   But and ben she'll guide the house,     I'se get milk and meal.   Ye'se get lilting while she sits     With her rock and reel.""   ""For, oh! she has a sweet tongue,     And een that look down,   A gold girdle for her waist,     And a purple gown.   She has a good word forbye     Fra a' folk in the town.""  Soon after sunrise they came to a great city, and it was perfectly still. There were grand towers and terraces, wharves, too, and a large market, but there was nobody anywhere to be seen. Jack thought that might be because it was so early in the morning; and when the boat ran itself up against a wooden wharf and stopped, he jumped ashore, for he thought this must be the end of his journey. A delightful town it was, if only there had been any people in it! The market-place was full of stalls, on which were spread toys, baskets, fruit, butter, vegetables, and all the other things that are usually sold in a market. Jack walked about in it. Then he looked in at the open doors of the houses, and at last, finding that they were all empty, he walked into one, looked at the rooms, examined the picture-books, rang the bells, and set the musical-boxes going. Then, after he had shouted a good deal, and tried in vain to make some one hear, he went back to the edge of the river where his boat was lying, and the water was so delightfully clear and calm, that he thought he would bathe. So he took off his clothes, and folding them very carefully, so as not to hurt the fairies, laid them down beside a hay-cock, and went in, and ran about and paddled for a long time,--much longer than there was any occasion for; but then he had nothing to do. When at last he had finished, he ran to the hay-cock and began to dress himself; but he could not find his stockings, and after looking about for some time he was obliged to put on his clothes without them, and he was going to put his boots on his bare feet, when, walking to the other side of the hay-cock, he saw a little old woman about as large as himself. She had a pair of spectacles on, and she was knitting. She looked so sweet-tempered that Jack asked her if she knew anything about his stockings. ""It will be time enough to ask for them when you have had your breakfast,"" said she. ""Sit down. Welcome to our town. How do you like it?"" [JACK'S NEW FRIEND. ""She had a pair of spectacles on, and she was knitting.""--PAGE 82.] ""I should like it very much indeed,"" said Jack, ""if there was anybody in it."" ""I'm glad of that,"" said the woman. ""You've seen a good deal of it; but it pleases me to find that you are a very honest boy. You did not take anything at all. I am honest too."" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""of course you are."" ""And as I am pleased with you for being honest,"" continued the little woman, ""I shall give you some breakfast out of my basket."" So she took out a saucer full of honey, a roll of bread, and a cup of milk. ""Thank you,"" said Jack, ""but I am not a beggar-boy; I have got a half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and two pence; so I can buy this breakfast of you, if you like. You look very poor."" ""Do I?"" said the little woman, softly; and she went on knitting, and Jack began to eat the breakfast. ""I wonder what has become of my stockings,"" said Jack. ""You will never see them any more,"" said the old woman. ""I threw them into the river, and they floated away."" ""Why did you?"" asked Jack. The little woman took no notice; but presently she had finished a beautiful pair of stockings, and she handed them to Jack, and said,-- ""Is that like the pair you lost?"" ""Oh no,"" said Jack; ""these are much more beautiful stockings than mine."" ""Do you like them as well?"" asked the fairy woman. ""I like them much better,"" said Jack, putting them on. ""How clever you are!"" ""Would you like to wear these,"" said the woman, ""instead of yours?"" She gave Jack such a strange look when she said this, that he was afraid to take them, and answered,-- ""I shouldn't like to wear them if you think I had better not."" ""Well,"" she answered, ""I am very honest, as I told you; and therefore I am obliged to say that if I were you I would not wear those stockings on any account."" ""Why not?"" said Jack; for she looked so sweet-tempered that he could not help trusting her. ""Why not?"" repeated the fairy; ""why, because when you have those stockings on, your feet belong to me."" ""Oh!"" said Jack. ""Well, if you think that matters, I'll take them off again. Do you think it matters?"" ""Yes,"" said the fairy woman; ""it matters, because I am a slave, and my master can make me do whatever he pleases, for I am completely in his power. So, if he found out that I had knitted these stockings for you, he would make me order you to walk into his mill,--the mill which grinds the corn for the town; and there you would have to grind and grind till I got free again."" When Jack heard this, he pulled off the beautiful stockings, and laid them on the old woman's lap. Upon this she burst out crying, as if her heart would break. ""If my fairies that I have in my pocket would only wake,"" said Jack, ""I would fight your master; for if he is no bigger than you are, perhaps I could beat him, and get you away."" ""No, Jack,"" said the little woman; ""that would be of no use. The only thing you could do would be to buy me; for my cruel master has said that if ever I am late again he shall sell me in the slave market to the brown people, who work underground. And, though I am dreadfully afraid of my master, I mean to be late to-day, in hopes (as you are kind, and as you have some money) that you will come to the slave-market and buy me. Can you buy me, Jack, to be your slave?"" ""I don't want a slave,"" said Jack; ""and, besides, I have hardly any money to buy you with."" ""But it is real money,"" said the fairy woman, ""not like what my master has. His money has to be made every week, for if there comes a hot day it cracks, so it never has time to look old, as your half-crown does; and that is how we know the real money, for we cannot imitate anything that is old. Oh, now, now it is twelve o'clock! now I am late again! and though I said I would do it, I am so frightened!"" So saying, the little woman ran off towards the town, wringing her hands, and Jack ran beside her. ""How am I to find your master?"" he said. ""O Jack, buy me! buy me!"" cried the fairy woman. ""You will find me in the slave-market. Bid high for me. Go back and put your boots on, and bid high."" Now Jack had nothing on his feet, so he left the poor little woman to run into the town by herself, and went back to put his boots on. They were very uncomfortable, as he had no stockings; but he did not much mind that, and he counted his money. There was the half-crown that his grandmamma had given him on his birthday, there was a shilling, a sixpence, and two pence, besides a silver fourpenny-piece which he had forgotten. He then marched into the town; and now it was quite full of people,--all of them little men and women about his own height. They thought he was somebody of consequence, and they called out to him to buy their goods. And he bought some stockings, and said, ""What I want to buy now is a slave.""
