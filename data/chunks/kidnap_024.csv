"CHAPTER XXIII. CLUNY’S CAGE We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood, which scrambled up a craggy hillside, and was crowned by a naked precipice. “It’s here,” said one of the guides, and we struck up hill. The trees clung upon the slope, like sailors on the shrouds of a ship, and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder, by which we mounted. Quite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the country as “Cluny’s Cage.” The trunks of several trees had been wattled across, the intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which grew out from the hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof. The walls were of wattle and covered with moss. The whole house had something of an egg shape; and it half hung, half stood in that steep, hillside thicket, like a wasp’s nest in a green hawthorn. Within, it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some comfort. A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the fireplace; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock, and being not dissimilar in colour, readily escaped notice from below. This was but one of Cluny’s hiding-places; he had caves, besides, and underground chambers in several parts of his country; and following the reports of his scouts, he moved from one to another as the soldiers drew near or moved away. By this manner of living, and thanks to the affection of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety, while so many others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four or five years longer, and only went to France at last by the express command of his master. There he soon died; and it is strange to reflect that he may have regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder. When we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney, watching a gillie about some cookery. He was mighty plainly habited, with a knitted nightcap drawn over his ears, and smoked a foul cutty pipe. For all that he had the manners of a king, and it was quite a sight to see him rise out of his place to welcome us. “Well, Mr. Stewart, come awa’, sir!” said he, “and bring in your friend that as yet I dinna ken the name of.” “And how is yourself, Cluny?” said Alan. “I hope ye do brawly, sir. And I am proud to see ye, and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws, Mr. David Balfour.” Alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer, when we were alone; but with strangers, he rang the words out like a herald. “Step in by, the both of ye, gentlemen,” says Cluny. “I make ye welcome to my house, which is a queer, rude place for certain, but one where I have entertained a royal personage, Mr. Stewart--ye doubtless ken the personage I have in my eye. We’ll take a dram for luck, and as soon as this handless man of mine has the collops ready, we’ll dine and take a hand at the cartes as gentlemen should. My life is a bit driegh,” says he, pouring out the brandy; “I see little company, and sit and twirl my thumbs, and mind upon a great day that is gone by, and weary for another great day that we all hope will be upon the road. And so here’s a toast to ye: The Restoration!” Thereupon we all touched glasses and drank. I am sure I wished no ill to King George; and if he had been there himself in proper person, it’s like he would have done as I did. No sooner had I taken out the drain than I felt hugely better, and could look on and listen, still a little mistily perhaps, but no longer with the same groundless horror and distress of mind. It was certainly a strange place, and we had a strange host. In his long hiding, Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits, like those of an old maid. He had a particular place, where no one else must sit; the Cage was arranged in a particular way, which none must disturb; cookery was one of his chief fancies, and even while he was greeting us in, he kept an eye to the collops. It appears, he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and one or two of his nearest friends, under the cover of night; but for the more part lived quite alone, and communicated only with his sentinels and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage. The first thing in the morning, one of them, who was a barber, came and shaved him, and gave him the news of the country, of which he was immoderately greedy. There was no end to his questions; he put them as earnestly as a child; and at some of the answers, laughed out of all bounds of reason, and would break out again laughing at the mere memory, hours after the barber was gone. To be sure, there might have been a purpose in his questions; for though he was thus sequestered, and like the other landed gentlemen of Scotland, stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers, he still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan. Disputes were brought to him in his hiding-hole to be decided; and the men of his country, who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session, laid aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and hunted outlaw. When he was angered, which was often enough, he gave his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king; and his gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty father. With each of them, as he entered, he ceremoniously shook hands, both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military manner. Altogether, I had a fair chance to see some of the inner workings of a Highland clan; and this with a proscribed, fugitive chief; his country conquered; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of him, sometimes within a mile of where he lay; and when the least of the ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened, could have made a fortune by betraying him. On that first day, as soon as the collops were ready, Cluny gave them with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon (for he was well supplied with luxuries) and bade us draw in to our meal. “They,” said he, meaning the collops, “are such as I gave his Royal Highness in this very house; bating the lemon juice, for at that time we were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen.* Indeed, there were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six.” ",cage last foot exceed steep wood scramble craggy hillside crown naked precipice guide strike hill tree cling slope sailor shroud ship trunk round ladder mount top rocky face cliff spring foliage find strange house country trunk several tree wattle interval strengthen stake ground barricade levell earth floor tree grow hillside living centre beam roof wall wattle cover moss whole house egg shape half hang half stand steep hillside thicket wasp nest green hawthorn large shelter person comfort projection cliff employ fireplace smoke rise face rock dissimilar colour escape notice hiding place cave underground chamber several part country follow report scout move soldier draw move manner living thanks affection clan stay time safety many other flead slain stay year last express command master die strange reflect regret cage door seat rock chimney watch gillie cookery mighty habited knite nightcap draw ear smoke foul cutty pipe manners king sight rise place welcome sir bring friend din name hope sir proud present friend refer estate touch sneer alone stranger ring word herald step gentleman house queer rude place certain entertain royal personage personage eye dram luck handless man collop ready dine hand carte gentleman life bit driegh pour brandy company sit twirl thumb mind great day gone weary great day hope road toast restoration touch glasses drink sure wish ill proper person drain feel listen same groundless horror distress mind strange place strange host long hiding grow manner precise habit old maid particular place else sit arrange particular way disturb cookery chief fancy greeting keep eye collop appear visit receive visit wife near friend cover night more part live alone communicate sentinel gilly wait cage first thing morning barber shave give news country greedy end question put child answer laugh bound reason break laugh mere memory hour barber gone sure purpose question sequester other land gentleman stripp late legal power exercise patriarchal justice clan dispute bring hiding hole decide man country snap finger lay revenge pay money bare word forfeit hunt outlaw anger enough give command breathe threat punishment king gilly tremble crouch child hasty father enter shake hand party touch bonnet same time military manner fair chance inner working clan proscribe fugitive chief country conquer troops ride side quest mile lay least ragged fellow rate threaten fortune betray first day collop ready give own hand squeeze lemon supply luxury bid draw meal mean collop such give royal very house bat lemon juice time glad meat fash kitchen mair dragoon lemon country year 
"     * Condiment. I do not know if the collops were truly very good, but my heart rose against the sight of them, and I could eat but little. All the while Cluny entertained us with stories of Prince Charlie’s stay in the Cage, giving us the very words of the speakers, and rising from his place to show us where they stood. By these, I gathered the Prince was a gracious, spirited boy, like the son of a race of polite kings, but not so wise as Solomon. I gathered, too, that while he was in the Cage, he was often drunk; so the fault that has since, by all accounts, made such a wreck of him, had even then begun to show itself. We were no sooner done eating than Cluny brought out an old, thumbed, greasy pack of cards, such as you may find in a mean inn; and his eyes brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing. Now this was one of the things I had been brought up to eschew like disgrace; it being held by my father neither the part of a Christian nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of others, on the cast of painted pasteboard. To be sure, I might have pleaded my fatigue, which was excuse enough; but I thought it behoved that I should bear a testimony. I must have got very red in the face, but I spoke steadily, and told them I had no call to be a judge of others, but for my own part, it was a matter in which I had no clearness. Cluny stopped mingling the cards. “What in deil’s name is this?” says he. “What kind of Whiggish, canting talk is this, for the house of Cluny Macpherson?” “I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour,” says Alan. “He is an honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says it. I bear a king’s name,” says he, cocking his hat; “and I and any that I call friend are company for the best. But the gentleman is tired, and should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you and me. And I’m fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can name.” “Sir,” says Cluny, “in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure. If your friend would like to stand on his head, he is welcome. And if either he, or you, or any other man, is not preceesely satisfied, I will be proud to step outside with him.” I had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my sake. “Sir,” said I, “I am very wearied, as Alan says; and what’s more, as you are a man that likely has sons of your own, I may tell you it was a promise to my father.” “Say nae mair, say nae mair,” said Cluny, and pointed me to a bed of heather in a corner of the Cage. For all that he was displeased enough, looked at me askance, and grumbled when he looked. And indeed it must be owned that both my scruples and the words in which I declared them, smacked somewhat of the Covenanter, and were little in their place among wild Highland Jacobites. What with the brandy and the venison, a strange heaviness had come over me; and I had scarce lain down upon the bed before I fell into a kind of trance, in which I continued almost the whole time of our stay in the Cage. Sometimes I was broad awake and understood what passed; sometimes I only heard voices, or men snoring, like the voice of a silly river; and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again, like firelight shadows on the roof. I must sometimes have spoken or cried out, for I remember I was now and then amazed at being answered; yet I was conscious of no particular nightmare, only of a general, black, abiding horror--a horror of the place I was in, and the bed I lay in, and the plaids on the wall, and the voices, and the fire, and myself. The barber-gillie, who was a doctor too, was called in to prescribe for me; but as he spoke in the Gaelic, I understood not a word of his opinion, and was too sick even to ask for a translation. I knew well enough I was ill, and that was all I cared about. I paid little heed while I lay in this poor pass. But Alan and Cluny were most of the time at the cards, and I am clear that Alan must have begun by winning; for I remember sitting up, and seeing them hard at it, and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on the table. It looked strange enough, to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliff-side, wattled about growing trees. And even then, I thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding, who had no better battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds. The luck, it seems, changed on the second day. About noon I was wakened as usual for dinner, and as usual refused to eat, and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed. The sun was shining in at the open door of the Cage, and this dazzled and offended me. Cluny sat at the table, biting the pack of cards. Alan had stooped over the bed, and had his face close to my eyes; to which, troubled as they were with the fever, it seemed of the most shocking bigness. He asked me for a loan of my money. “What for?” said I. “O, just for a loan,” said he. “But why?” I repeated. “I don’t see.” “Hut, David!” said Alan, “ye wouldnae grudge me a loan?” I would, though, if I had had my senses! But all I thought of then was to get his face away, and I handed him my money. On the morning of the third day, when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage, I awoke with a great relief of spirits, very weak and weary indeed, but seeing things of the right size and with their honest, everyday appearance. I had a mind to eat, moreover, rose from bed of my own movement, and as soon as we had breakfasted, stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood. It was a grey day with a cool, mild air: and I sat in a dream all morning, only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny’s scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports; for as the coast was at that time clear, you might almost say he held court openly. When I returned, he and Alan had laid the cards aside, and were questioning a gillie; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the Gaelic. “I have no Gaelic, sir,” said I. Now since the card question, everything I said or did had the power of annoying Cluny. “Your name has more sense than yourself, then,” said he angrily, “for it’s good Gaelic. But the point is this. My scout reports all clear in the south, and the question is, have ye the strength to go?” I saw cards on the table, but no gold; only a heap of little written papers, and these all on Cluny’s side. Alan, besides, had an odd look, like a man not very well content; and I began to have a strong misgiving. “I do not know if I am as well as I should be,” said I, looking at Alan; “but the little money we have has a long way to carry us.” ",condiment collop heart rise sight eat entertain story stay give very word speaker rise place show stand gather gracious spirit boy son race polite king wise gather drunk fault account wreck begin show eat bring old thumb greasy pack card such find mean inn eye brighten face propose fall play thing bring eschew disgrace hold father part gentleman set own livelihood fish other cast paint pasteboard sure plead fatigue excuse behove bear testimony red face speak call judge other own part matter clearness stop mingle card deil name kind canting talk house put hand fire honest mettle gentleman bear mind bear king name cock hat call friend company gentleman tired sleep mind carte hinder fit willing sir play game name poor house gentleman follow pleasure friend like stand head welcome other man satisfied proud step will friend cut throat sake wearied more man son own promise father point bed heather corner cage displease askance grumble own scruple word declare smack place wild brandy venison strange heaviness scarce lain bed fall kind trance continue whole time stay cage broad awake understand pass hear voice man snore voice silly river plaid wall dwindle swell firelight shadow roof speak cry remember amaze answer conscious particular nightmare general black abide horror horror place bed lay plaid wall voice fire barber gillie doctor call prescribe speak understand word opinion sick ask translation ill care pay heed lay poor pass most time card clear begin win remember sit great glitter pile much guinea table strange wealth nest cliff side wattle grow tree seem deep water ride battle horse green purse matter pound luck seem change second day noon waken usual dinner usual refuse eat give dram bitter infusion barber prescribe sun shine open door dazzle offend sit table bite pack card stoop bed face close eye trouble fever seem shocking bigness ask loan money  loan repeat grudge loan sense face hand money morning third day hour awoke great relief spirit weak weary thing right size honest everyday appearance mind eat rise bed own movement breakfast step entry cage sit top wood grey day cool mild air sit dream morning disturb passing scout servant provision report coast time clear hold court return lay card question gillie chief turn speak sir card question power annoy name more sense point scout report clear south question strength card table gold heap write paper side odd man content begin strong misgiving money long way carry
