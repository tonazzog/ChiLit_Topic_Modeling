"CHAPTER X.  The young people were all impatience next morning to visit Peggy Dobie’s cottage. They met Mr. Howard returning from it, who told them they would find Peggy much recovered. He had found her up, sitting by the fire reading her Bible, and full of gratitude and thanksgiving for the blessings which surrounded her. “My bairns,” she said as they entered, and she closed her Bible and laid aside her spectacles, “you have come at the right moment--I hae been giving praise to Him that has lifted me out o’ my sair tribulations, and it is here I hae found the words, and noo may He put into my heart what I should say to you; how can I ever thank you enough for all I see about me, for all you have done for me?” “You need not thank us, Peggy,” Leila answered; “for we are as happy as you are; and it is so joyful that you should be alive, and so wonderful, that we can scarce believe it;--and so you like your house?” “Like it, Miss Leila! ’deed that’s no’ the word to testify my wonderment at all I see around me. I hae been looking at that cupboard, wi’ all the tumblers and glasses sparkling and shining like a leddy dressed out in her diamonds, and praying that my auld head may not be turned all the gether wi’ the vanities o’ life; but to feel that I hae come to sic a haven o’ rest, to lie down on that bed last night, and to think it was my ain; to think that I am no longer a wanderer on the face o’ the earth, without a covering to my auld head, or a friend to speak the word o’ comfort to my crushed spirit--no, it’s no’ just at ance that I can get into a measure o’ composedness for sic a change as this. I am in a bewilderment o’ joy and gratitude--and there’s Dash, bonnie man, wagging his tail, and aye looking in my face; he is telling me we are in the land o’ Canaan noo. O let me ever thank God for all his mercies; and let me thank you also, my dear bairns, for all your kindness to me; for never did I think to have seen your bit canty faces again in the land o’ the living, for it’s out o’ the swellings o’ Jordan that puir auld Peggy has been delivered by an arm o’ strength.” “It is so nice to hear you speaking Scotch again,” Matilda said; “I like it so much. That word canty is such a nice word, and it is so nice to have you back again when we thought you dead; but how did it all happen? Were you not washed overboard in the storm? You must tell us all about it. How were you saved?” “Yes,” Leila said, “it will be such an interesting story, and so long; for you must tell us every thing from the very beginning. But you are not to tell it all in one day, for that would tire you. You are very, very thin, Peggy,” and Leila took Peggy’s withered hand in hers; “can we do nothing to make you better? If it will tire you to speak, we will wait for the story till another day.” “No, my dear bairn, it will no tire me; and it’s weel my part to do all I can to pleasure you or yours, though I will not just say but what I may feel a wee thought ashamed to tell sic a lang tale afore all the young ladies, and this fine young gentleman.” “But Peggy,” Leila said eagerly, “he is not a fine young gentleman; he is so kind and good-natured, he will like to hear the history of all that has happened to you very much; and if he does not understand all the Scotch words, I will explain them to him afterwards; he is my brother Charles now, you need not be afraid of him.” “Your brother, is he? Weel, weel, sae let it be for the present, my bonnie lamb. And noo where am I to begin in this lang tale?” “At the very beginning,” Leila and Matilda both exclaimed at once; “at the very beginning, Peggy, when you first embarked with all the pets.” “Ay, ay, and to think I hae no had the grace to ask after the puir dumb things; but I am sair bewildered, and I kent they needs be safe, for there’s my cat that was amang them, just lying afore the fire quite contented, and no ways strange, puir thing. That civil gentleman, Master Bill, (I think they call him,) brought it up to me this morning, and my trunk too with my big Bible, and all the bits o’ things that are sae valuable to me.” “But the story, the story, Peggy,” Matilda exclaimed, rather emphatically. “Yes, my bairn, that’s true, I was forgetting, and it’s aye the story, the story, wi’ you young things. Weel then, to begin at the very beginning, as you say. We got into the ship, (that is, the pets, as Miss Leila calls them, and me,) and it was a bonnie day, and the sea sparkling like diamonds, and wi’ a most deceitfu’ and canny look; but it was all put on; no a word o’ truth in it, for it’s a most unchancy and awfu’ element, and in no ways to be trusted by a Christian woman. Weel, my first discomfiture was when I was telt that I was by no means to go near the pets, or to take any charge, for they would have better care than mine; deed, and I was in no ways weel pleased, forbye that I had been thinking the parrots would have been gude company, and that I could hae given them some gude instruction maybe, puir things, and got them into a manner o’ more sensible discourse than aye crying, ‘pretty poll,’ and the like o’ thae vain and silly things. But it was no to be, so I turned my mind to some wee helpless bairns that were aye wailing and wearying for something; for ye ken Peggy must aye be doing. They had lost their mother, puir things, and the father o’ them was sadly put about when night came, and all their bits o’ clothes to take off, and the strings o’ them aye getting into knots, and he wi’ no manner o’ skill or judgment to gang to work in the right manner; so I took them all in my ain hands, and got them into their bits o’ cribs wi’ a kind o’ comfort, and the wee thing who was but a babby clinging round my neck in the dark, and saying, ‘Mamma was come back again, and she was no to gang away ony more.’ Deed it was just a moving scene, and minded me sae o’ my ain bonnie flowers; and John, for that was his name, was sae gratified, and could no’ say enough for the little I could do. And so we got on wi’ a measure o’ comfort all the next day, till the wind began to roar like a demented creature, wi’ no manner o’ discretion, ranting and tearing wi’ the steadfast resolution no to leave a hale rag in the ship; and there were the bairns, puir things, wailing and tumbling about on the floor, and nae marvel either, seeing that them that had come to the years o’ discretion could na keep their feet; and the captain, there was he crying to put in the dead lights, which was no just civil to say the least, and we wi’ the breath o’ life still in our bodies. Waes me, but it was an unco’ dispensation for him to be making preparations for a dead wake afore the living folk. He might hae thought, the ungodly man, that there was an arm o’ strength that could lift us out o’ the deepest pit of our tribulation.--But where was I? for ’deed I am sair bewildered wi’ all that happened.” “You were telling about the storm, Peggy,” Matilda said, eagerly. “Oh, do go on, it is so very interesting.” “Ay, that’s true, I was telling about the storm; but waes me, words are weak to tell o’ that awfu’ scene. Weel, naething would serve me but I maun be upon deck to see the warst o’ it; and there I stood, clinging aye to John, and Dash at my side, wi’ the sense o’ a man o’ fifty, holding me fast by the gown; but it was na waves I saw, but mountains rising to the black heavens, and the white foam o’ them looking ghastly white in the darkness o’ the night, and every now and then a flash o’ fire like a curtain o’ flame in the sky, and a sound like guns mingling wi’ the roar o’ the awfu’ blast; and there was the captain again, wi’ a lang thing like a trumpet in his mouth, and he thinking, wi’ his puir feckless breath, to lift his voice above the anger o’ Heaven. I could na stand that, so I turned down to the cabin again; but oh, my bairns, never while the breath o’ life is in my body will I forget the sound that ere I was at the foot o’ the stairs met my ear. I canna speak o’ it, I dare na think o’ it. Them that had stood at my side the minute afore in life and strength, sent to their last account, and without the power o’ a hand being stretched out to save them. I am no clear in my mind o’ what happened for a while after that; but then there was a cry that the wind was no just sae strong, and that a boat had come off from the shore for the passengers for Scarborough; it was for Scarborough John was bound, to take up his abode wi’ a sister, a widow-woman weel to do in the world, and he was loath to part wi’ me, and leave me in sic tribulation; and the bairns they aye cried that mammy maun gang too, and I was down the side o’ the ship, and in the boat wi’ the wee babby in my arms afore I kent where I was, and Dash holding on again by my gown as he did afore; and how we e’er reached the shore was the gracious providence of God, for man had nought to do wi’ it; and we were up in the air the one minute, and in the watery pit o’ destruction the next, and no a dry stitch upon us when we were lifted out wi’ scarce the breath o’ life in our bodies; but all but gratitude to Heaven was forgotten when we sat that night in quietness and in comfort by that widow-woman’s cheerful fire-side. And to see the bairns round the table at their tea, wi’ their bit blythe faces, and ilk are wi’ a jolly piece in its hand, for, as I said afore, she was well to do in the world that widow-woman, and had all things in a superior way. ’Deed it was a scene to lift the heart wi’ gratitude and joy, and at night when I found myself in a quiet comfortable bed, and nae mair heizing up and down wi’ all thae outlandish sounds in my ear, ’deed I could na sleep wi’ very pleasure, so I took to musing on the uses o’ the sea, and I could na make it weel out at all; it seemed to me as if it was a fearfu’ scourge, aye ready to be let loose on our sinfu’ heads, and made for naething but our destruction; but then I minded me o’ the fine caller haddys, and thae herrings at ten a penny, sic a blessing for the puir, and then I thought that there might be a measure o’ comfort in it after all, so wi’ that I fell asleep. The next morning I thought to hae gone on my way, but they would nae hear o’ it, and the bairns they aye clung to me, and said I was to stay and be their mamma. ’Deed, auld as I was, I could nae but think o’ sic a proposal afore John’s very face; and he, honest man, no ways willing. The day after that John set out wi’ me to put me on my road, and he wrote me out a paper o’ all the towns I was to gang through, and sae we parted, and I gaed on my way, thinking it wad be but a pleasant walk; but waes me, I had little thought or comprehension o’ what was afore me. But I am thinking I have said enough for this present time; you will be weary wi’ sic a lang tale.” ", young person impatience next morning visit cottage meet return find recover find sit fire read full gratitude thanksgiving blessing surround bairn enter close lay spectacle right moment give praise lift sair tribulation find word put heart thank thank answer happy joyful alive wonderful scarce believe like house deed word testify wonderment cupboard tumbler glasses sparkling shine dress diamond pray auld head turn gether wil vanity life feel sic haven rest lie bed last night ain wanderer face earth covering auld head friend speak word comfort crush spirit ance measure composedness change bewilderment joy gratitude man wag tail face land let thank mercie let thank dear bairn kindness bit canty face land living swelling puir deliver arm strength nice hear speak like word canty nice word nice dead happen wash storm save interesting story thing very beginning day tire thin wither hand tire speak wait story day dear bairn tire part pleasure feel wee ashamed lang tale young lady fine young gentleman fine young gentleman kind natured like hear history happen understand word explain brother afraid brother let present bonnie lamb begin lang tale very beginning exclaim very beginning embark pet grace ask puir dumb thing bewilder kean need safe cat amang lie fire contented way strange puir thing civil gentleman call bring morning trunk big bit thing valuable story story exclaim bairn true forget story story young thing begin very beginning ship pet call bonnie day sea sparkling diamond wil put word truth unchancy element way trust christian woman first discomfiture means pet charge care deed way pleased parrot gude company give gude instruction puir thing manner sensible discourse cry poll thae vain silly thing turn mind wee helpless bairn wail weary lose mother puir thing father put night bit clothes string knot wil manner skill judgment gang work right manner ain hand bit crib kind comfort wee thing babby cling neck dark gang more move scene minded ain bonnie flower name gratified measure comfort next day wind begin roar demented creature wil manner discretion rant tear steadfast resolution leave hale rag ship bairn puir thing wail tumble floor marvel year discretion keep foot captain cry put dead light civil least wil breath life body wae dispensation preparation dead wake living folk ungodly man arm strength lift deep pit tribulation deed bewilder happen storm interesting true storm wae word weak scene naething serve deck warst stand cling side sense man hold gown wave mountain rise black heaven white foam ghastly white darkness night flash fire curtain flame sky sound gun mingle roar blast captain wil lang thing trumpet mouth puir feckless breath lift voice anger stand turn cabin bairn breath life body forget sound foot stair meet ear speak dare stand side minute life strength send last account power hand stretch save clear mind happen while cry wind strong boat shore passenger bind abode sister widow woman weel world loath part leave sic tribulation bairn cry mammy maun gang side ship boat wee babby arm kean hold gown reach shore gracious providence man nough will air minute watery pit destruction next dry stitch lift breath life body gratitude forget sit night quietness comfort widow woman cheerful fire side bairn table tea bit face ilk jolly piece hand well world widow woman thing superior way scene lift heart gratitude joy night find quiet comfortable bed mair heize will outlandish sound ear deed sleep pleasure muse use sea seem scourge ready let loose head naething destruction minded fine caller haddy thae herring penny blessing puir measure comfort fall asleep next morning way hear bairn aye cling stay mamma noe proposal face honest man way willing day set wil put road write paper town gang part gake way pleasant walk wae thought comprehension present time weary lang tale 
"“Oh no, Peggy,” Leila exclaimed, “I am quite sure none of us are weary. Do go on, for we wish so much to hear how you got here at last.” “And ’deed, my bairn, that’s no easy to tell, for I have but a confused thought o’ all that happened. Every day I walked on and on, and when I came to the towns, I sleeped at big houses that they call houses o’ entertainment: but ’deed it was no diversion to me, the money they aye asked frae me in the mornings; so I took to sleeping at farm-houses, and that answered better. To be sure sometimes I had but the barn or the hay-loft, and but a short word o’ welcome; but others that were mair civil let me sleep in the big chair by the kitchen fire-side; and clean and comfortable mony o’ the kitchens were, dishes and platters on the walls shining like silver, and big hams hanging from the roof, wi’ the greatest plenty to eat and drink, and blythe bairns running about, looking sae like their meat, that it did my heart good to see them. I was aye happy when I got to a farm-house at night; but sometimes I was not just sae lucky; and what wi’ paying for a night’s lodgings, and for a ride in a wagon or a cart now and then, and for a loaf o’ bread and a draught o’ beer, my money was fast melting away, and my heart no that light; for aye when I asked if I was near London yet, they said it was a weary way, and ower far for sic an auld woman as me to compass. But it was only when the days were fast shortening, and the long nights setting in, that the like o’ thae reflections crushed my spirit; yet the morning’s sun made all right again and warmed my auld heart, and I felt there was a Providence abune that could make the roughest way plain and the langest way short to me. I was aye fond o’ the song o’ the robin, and whiles I would sit down by the side o’ a hedge and hearken to them in the trees abune my head, and then I would throw them some crumbs frae my loaf o’ bread to pleasure them puir things; and the bonnie creatures would come down to the ground and look up in my face, as if I had been a kent friend. And Dash, the wise animal, he would keep his distance, and lie as if the breath o’ life was out of his body, till they had ta’en their breakfast wi’ comfort and discretion. From all that I hae experienced in my lang travel, I think the robins are o’ the same nature as in my ain land, just as frank and as kindly. But oh, my bairns! sic a difference in the rivers; instead of the clear bonnie Esk that I had been used to, wi’ the sand lying at the bottom sparkling like diamonds in some parts, and in others springing over the big stones like bairns let loose frae the school, there I came to rivers as quiet and lazy as mill-ponds, and looking as black and drumlie as if they had washed all the dishes in thae big towns in them; but ’deed it’s no wise discreet in me to be making thae reflections; for if their waters are no just sae clear, surely I am come to a land flowing with milk and honey, and need na mind. But I am wandering from my road again.” “Yes, Peggy,” Matilda said, “you are forgetting to tell us how your money lasted, and what you did when it was done. Oh! it must have been so dreadful when you began to be starved to death.” “‘Deed, and it was no ways pleasant; but it was no just sae bad as that; and I aye keepit a thought on Him who feedeth the fowls o’ the air, and was no that down-hearted; still it was a serious thought, and I was at my last shilling when the pedlar was graciously sent to me.” “The pedlar, Peggy, how was that?” “You see, Miss Matilda, I was sitting by the road-side one morning, taking counsel wi’ my ain thoughts and looking at the shilling, and turning it round and round in my hand wi’ a serious countenance, nae doubt, when an honest man wi’ a pack upon his back came up to me. ‘Mistress,’ he said, ‘you are looking at that shilling as if there werena mony ahint it, and you were loath to part company.’ ‘’Deed,’ I said, ‘you hae made a gude guess and are no far wrong; for it’s the very last shilling I hae in the world, and a long journey, I reckon, is still afore me.’ Wi’ that we fell into discourse, and I telt him all my story; for he was frae my ain country, and my heart warmed to him. He said that for that day and the next our road lay in the same direction, and that he would be blythe o’ my company. Was I to refuse sic a civil invitation?--by no means. So we gaed on our way thegither, and had muckle pleasant discourse; for he was far travelled, and had great learning and experience o’ the world, and was, forbye, a God-fearing and civil man, and had but one fault that I could discern, he was ower fond o’ beer; preserve me, but I would hae sleepit sound, and ower sound, as he, puir man, found that night, if I had ta’en all he offered me, for he was no ways niggardly; and when I spoke o’ asking up-pitting for the night at a farm-house, he would na hear it; he would treat me, he said, baith to a supper and a bed, and be blythe to do so. Weel, when night came on, we turned into a comfortable-looking house by the road-side, where they selt the beer he was ower fond o’; and it was a canty scene that big kitchen, that lifted the very heart o’ me. There was the mistress frying bacon on the warm red fire, and mair than one hungry man sitting on low stools, listening wi’ delight to the hissing sound o’ it; and a wee baby in a cradle, no thinking o’ sleep, but lying so pleased, wi’ the great een o’ it wide open, and staring at its brothers and sisters, dancing in a corner o’ the room to the music o’ a blind fiddler; they were near to a table where some men were drinking, and there was a man sat there wi’ a face I could no get out o’ my mind at all. He had a down look and an ill look to my thought; and I noticed that though he had his tankard o’ beer afore him like the rest, when he thought nae body was looking that way, he lifted the tankard that had been put down afore the puir blind fiddler, and took a lang pull out o’ it. I would na hae been that sorry if it had choked him, and I felt in my mind that the man would surely come to shame and want. Aweel, when the mistress showed me the room I was to sleep in, I could na get this man’s ill face out o’ my mind, and I asked her if the men that were drinking at the table were to bide all night. ‘Some of them might,’ she said, ‘and some might not; but I need not be frightened, for my friend the pedlar was to sleep in the next room to me, and there was a door through frae my room to his. You see,’ she said, ‘there is only a latch to it, for the key has been lost; but as he is an honest man nae doubt, and your friend, you will no mind that; but this is a decent house, and you need fear no disturbance;’ and wi’ that she left me. I had not been long in bed afore I heard the pedlar, honest man, snoring soundly. I was weary, weary, and yet for a lang time I could no get to sleep, for the fiddle seemed aye sounding in my ears, and the bit bairnies dancing afore me, and that man’s ill face aye taking anither look at me, but after a time I heard steps passing up the stairs, and the front door was barred in, and quietness fell upon the house; and then, though it was no just sleep that came over me, it was a kind o’ a dover, and how lang it lasted I canna tell, but suddenly it seemed to me as if I heard a step in the passage and some one stopping at my door,--I started up in my bed and listened; a lock turned, but it was na in my room, but in the next; and then I saw a light under the door that had the latch. I sprang up and looked through the key-hole; the ill face o’ that awfu’ man seemed glaring on me, I could scarcely breathe, for I felt sure he saw me, but he turned away and went straight up to the bed; he seemed to listen for a moment, bending over it, then softly lifting up a worsted plaid that was lying over a chair by the bed-side, he seized the pack which the plaid was covering, and turned to the door again. He had his back to me then; I lifted the latch and sprang in, and the next moment I had him by the throat, the ill rascal, wi’ a scream that wakened the whole house. He let fall the pack, shook me off as if I had been a feather, and darted along the passage. He took me for a ghaist, nae doubt; for, for decency’s sake, I had put the white sheet about me. Aweel, we looked for him all over the house, but saw naething but a window wide open, and doubtless out o’ that window the ill-conditioned creature had gone on his evil way. It was na muckle sleep that either the pedlar or me got that night, I reckon, for I heard nae mair snoring.” ",exclaim sure weary wish much hear last deed bairn easy confused thought happen day walk town sleep big house call house entertainment deed diversion money ask frie morning sleep farm house answer sure barn hay loft short word other mair civil let sleep big chair kitchen fire side clean comfortable mony kitchen dish plateer wall shine silver big ham hang roof great plenty eat drink bairn run meat heart happy farm house night lucky pay night lodging ride wagon cart loaf bread draught beer money fast melt heart light ask weary way auld woman compass day fast shorten long night set reflection crush spirit morning sun warm auld heart feel abune roughest way plain langest way short fond song robin sit side hedge hearken tree abune head throw crumb frie loaf bread pleasure puir thing bonnie creature ground face kent friend wise animal keep distance lie breath life body tay breakfast comfort discretion experience lang travel robin same nature ain land frank bairn difference river clear bonnie use sand lie bottom sparkling diamond part other spring big stone bairn let loose frie school river quiet lazy mill pond black drumlie wash dish big town deed wise discreet reflection water clear land flow milk honey need mind wonder road forget money last dreadful begin starve death way pleasant bad keepit thought feedeth fowl air hearted serious thought last shilling pedlar send pedlar sit road side morning counsel will ain thought shilling turn hand serious countenance doubt honest man wil pack back mistress shilling mony ahint loath part company gude guess wrong last shilling hae world long journey reckon fall discourse story ain country heart warm day next road lay same direction company refuse civil invitation means gake way muckle pleasant discourse travel great learning experience world fear civil man fault discern ower fond beer preserve hae sleepit sound sound puir man find night tay offer way speak ask pit night farm house hear treat baith supper bed night turn comfortable house road side sell beer ower fond canty scene big kitchen lift very heart mistress fry bacon warm red fire mair hungry man sit low stool listen delight hissing sound wee baby cradle thinking sleep lie pleased great een open stare brother sister dance corner room music blind fiddler table man drink man sit wil face mind down ill thought notice tankard beer rest body way lift tankard put puir blind fiddler lang pull sorry choke feel mind man shame want mistress show room sleep man ill face mind ask man drink table bide night frighten friend pedlar sleep next room door room latch key lose honest man doubt friend mind decent house need fear disturbance leave long bed hear pedlar honest man snore weary weary lang time sleep fiddle seem sound ear bit bairny dance man ill face anither time hear step pass stair front door barr quietness fall house sleep kind dover lang last seem hear step passage one stop door start bed listen lock turn room next light door latch spring key hole ill face man seem glaring breathe feel sure turn bed seem listen moment bending lift worsted plaid lie chair bed side seize pack plaid cover turn door back lift latch spring next moment throat ill rascal scream waken whole house let fall pack shake feather dart passage ghaist doubt decency sake put white sheet house naething window open window ill condition creature evil way muckle sleep pedlar night reckon hear mair snoring 
"“Oh, Peggy!” more than one voice exclaimed, “how frightful and how interesting; but go on, go on, tell us more.” “Aweel, in the morning he could na be grateful enough, honest man, for what I had done for him. ‘For himself,’ he said, ‘he did na’ fancy riding much, but it would be a rest to me; so all that day we rode thegither in a wagon like ladies and gentlemen, he treating me to the best o’ every thing, and himsel’ no taking just sae muckle o’ the beer. The next morning after that, when we parted, he would force upon me twa bonnie white half-crowns, and telt me aye to ride when I could, for that he did not think I was that strong for sic an undertaking as I had still before me. I would fain hae refused the money, for it seemed to me like taking payment for doing only what was natural to do; but I thought also that pride might have something to do wi’ refusing, and pride was na’ for a Christian woman, so I took the siller. I took his advice too, for I felt that I was not that strong; so I aye rode when I could get a cart or a wagon, but it took mair money than I could weel spare. Many o’ the wagoners and carters spoke a language I could na’ weel make out, but they aye contrived to make it plain to me that they wanted siller. Every day my pocket got lighter and lighter, and my heart heavier; for I came to my last penny, and still a lang way lay afore me. I need na’ vex your hearts wi’ all I suffered wi’ want and lang travel. Some of the folk were kind to me, and some were not; I dinna weel mind all that happened, I ken only that aye when I was at my last extremity, He that I serve had pity upon me; and I aye remembered that ‘He had not where to lay His head,’ and took courage. One night I came to a farm-house, the door was shut, but I looked through the kitchen window, and, oh! but it was a cheerfu’ canty scene. There was a cat as big and as sleek as a fat lamb lying afore the warm fire, and the mistress and the gudeman, and the bairns, and the farm servants, all round a big table at their supper, and the greatest plenty o’ every thing, and sic a smoke from the big dishes o’ meat and o’ potatoes, and sic a speaking and laughing, that I had to tap many a time afore they heard me; but at last the mistress hersel’ came to the door, and wi’ her a bonnie wee lassie at her side. I was all in a tremble, and I telt her my story, and asked for a night’s lodging; but the pleasant face o’ her entirely changed. ‘And how am I to know,’ she said, ‘that there is a word of truth in all this? always the story that they have lost their way, or lost their money, or some such thing. It was but last night that I gave lodging to an old woman, who looked as respectable as you do, and she was off this morning by daybreak with two of my best night-caps that were drying before the fire. No, no, you must take the road again, and be thankful you have a clear moon above your head.’ ‘Oh, mother, mother!’ I heard the wee thing say, but she shut the door in my face. I was weary, and I was faint wi’ hunger too, for I had tasted little that day; to gang on my way was no possible, for the very life seemed sinking out o’ me; so I crept round by the back o’ the house to seek some sheltered nook to lie down in, no wishing ever to rise again. All my desire was to lay myself down in a quiet corner and there to be found dead in the morning. I was leaning against a wall sair spent, and Dash keeping close at my side, as he aye did, striving, puir thing, to keep me warm, when a mist came afore my eyes--it cleared away, and I seemed to see my ain bonnie bairns wi’ the faces o’ angels beckoning to me, and I heard my husband’s voice speaking words o’ comfort, and then a door at the back of the house softly opened, and the bonnie lamb I had seen afore stepped out into the moonlight; she looked about her for a moment on every side, and when the light fell on the face o’ her, it seemed to me as if she too was a kind spirit frae anither world. She was passing to the front o’ the house when she saw me, and, oh!--but it was a sweet voice that sounded in my ear when she took my hand, and said,--‘There is a sixpence and a penny for you, it is all the money I have, but maybe it will get you a bed at a house you will soon come to on the road-side; and here is some bread and cheese for your supper, for I am sure you are hungry.’ I was trying to say something, when a voice cried out, ‘Alice, Alice, where are you?’ and the mistress hersel’ came up to where we were standing. ‘Oh, mother!’ the dear bairn said, ‘do not put her away for she looks so sorrowful and she can scarcely walk; do let her sit at the kitchen fire all night--I am sure she is an honest woman.’ The mistress looked in my face. ‘Well,’ she said, I may have judged you wrongfully, so I will take Alice’s word for it; for it’s not my usual custom to turn my face from the poor of the land, so come in, old woman, and you shall have some supper.’ She took me into the warm kitchen, and seated me at the fire, and the best o’ every thing was set afore me, and bonnie wee Alice took a low stool and set herself down at my feet, and she aye looked up in my face wi’ her kindly smile, and seemed to enjoy every morsel I put in my mouth; and she could na make enough o’ Dash, and was sae pleased when the mistress hersel’ set a plate o’ bones afore him that might have served a king. Aweel, we took our supper wi’ thanksgiving, and in a closet off the kitchen I had a clean comfortable bed to lie down on, which was a great refreshment. The mistress took to me in an uncommon way. I telt her where I was going, and all about it; and in the morning she gave me my breakfast and a white shilling out o’ her ain pocket. I was fain to gie little Alice back her sixpence and the penny, but she was affronted and would na hear tell o’ it; so I laid them down on the wee pillow o’ her bed when she was looking anither way.” The tears were in Leila’s eyes: “Oh, Peggy,” she said, “what a dear little girl Alice must have been! how I wish I could thank her for being so very kind to you; but you are not to stop yet, you have more to tell us.” “Not much more, Miss Leila, for mony o’ the days after that seem to have passed out o’ my mind. I think it was but twice after that that I had onything like a decent bed to lie down on; it was getting darkish one day when I was passing through a village, a heap o’ bairns came running past just out o’ school, and a wild laddie had something tied up in a napkin, and he aye cried he was going to drown it, and they maun come and see. My mind misgave me that it was a kitten, puir thing, so I followed on to a pond that I saw afore me, and just as I got near I heard sic a wild screech, and there was a wee lassie struggling in the water; I cried loud to Dash, and he was into the pond in no time, and afore anither minute was over, the puir half-drowned thing was laid at my feet. Aweel, I took it up in my arms and turned back to the village. The mother o’ it was like to go out o’ her judgment wi’ fright and wi’ joy; I stayed to help to put the bairn into a warm bed, the puir lamb would nae be comforted. Aye when we thought that she was dropping over to sleep she started up again in an unco tremble, and crying out, ‘No, no, mother, don’t be angry, I will never, never go near the pond again;’ and when Dash came up to the bed wagging his tail, and trying to make acquaintance wi’ her, she was like to go out o’ her judgment, wi’ no manner o’ knowledge or gratitude for what he had done for her. Aweel, she fell into a sleep at last; ‘Oh, my darling,’ the mother said, ‘many’s the time I have told her to keep away from those wicked boys, and by no means to go near that ugly pond, for my mind misgave me that something might happen; but she has been punished enough, poor thing, she will not again forget my warning;’ and she leaned over the dear bairn wi’ sic joy and thankfulness, and kissed her over and over again. Though it was getting late, I thought now to have gone on my way again, but though she was but a widow woman, and seemed to have naught to spare, she would na hear of it, so I stayed wi’ her that night, and she did all she could to make me comfortable. The next circumstance that I remember was when I found myself in a town, and sae spent wi’ hunger I could scarcely walk; I had parted wi’ my warm cloak afore, and I think shame to tell you how many salt tears that had cost me, (but it was a present from my gudeman,) and I was thinking if there was onything else I could sell, and holding by the rails, for I could scarcely stand, when a decent-looking young woman, wi’ a most pleasant face, came up to me. ‘What is the matter, poor woman,’ she said, in a kindly voice, ‘you are surely ill?’ I telt her I was starving. ‘Waes me,’ she said, ‘and I have no money to give you, for I have just been disappointed myself: but come with me, you shall have something to eat at least.’ She took me by the arm and helped me on, and we entered a big house, where a great mony people seemed to be living, for I heard voices o’ men and women, and bairns, some crying and some laughing. ‘My sister and I have a room here,’ she said, as we gaed up the stairs; then taking me by the hand along a dark passage, she opened a door, and I saw a young woman sitting close to the window working busily, though it was getting dark. ‘Jessie,’ she said, ‘you will have thought me long away, and after all I have come back without the money for the shirts, for Mrs. Churchill was not at home.’ ‘Without the money,’ Jessie repeated, ‘and not a morsel in the house beyond our night’s supper, and not a farthing to buy more! Oh, Ellen, this is sorrowful news. But who is this you have got with you?’ Ellen told her how she had fallen in wi’ me, and it was beautiful to see the kindness o’ baith the sisters. There was but a small fire, but they gathered up the cinders, and made me sit close to it, and they rubbed my hands and spoke words o’ comfort to me; and Ellen brought some bread and cheese out of a cupboard, and set it afore me, and baith o’ them pressed me to eat. Just then there was a tap at the door. ‘That will be the nurse,’ Ellen said, jumping up; ‘I forgot to tell you that she said she might perhaps be able to bring the money if her mistress came home in time.’ It was the nurse sure enough, and oh, sic joy as it was to the kind-hearted creatures when the nurse counted down ten bonnie shillings on the table. ‘Put on the tea-kettle,’ Ellen said, ‘and I will be back in a moment with some tea and sugar; and, Mistress Nurse, perhaps you will stay and take a cup of tea, you have always been such a kind friend to us.’ But Mistress Nurse said she could by no means stay, for her lady might want her; and she was just going away when she noticed Dash. ‘Bless me,’ she said, ‘what a fine animal, but how thin he is; he looks half-starved; my heart is sore for the creature, tea is not just the thing for him, but if I can get hold of the stable-boy when I go home, I will send him up with a plate of scraps; he will like that better.’ And she was as good as her word; Dash had such a supper as he had not seen for many a day. And how the sisters were pleased and diverted when the creature picked out the largest bone he could find in all the platter, and laid it at my feet. Aweel, we had our tea in comfort, and the best o’ butter, which Ellen said was a treat by ordinar, and muckle pleasant discourse; and I telt them about you, Miss Selina, getting your speech again, and about Miss Leila in the island. They said it was like a fairy tale, and that they had naething to tell me about themselves sae romantic. They had lost baith father and mother, and they worked for their bread, and had come through great straits; sometimes they had plenty to do, and were comfortable enough, and sometimes they were sair put about, and at their last penny; but their mother had been a God-fearing woman, and had given them the best o’ counsel, and they aye kept up their hearts, for there was a Providence abune, they said, that kent what was best for them. The room was clean and neat, though the furniture was scant. There was but one bed, but they borrowed a mattress from a kind neighbour, and I lay baith warm and comfortable on it. In the morning I had a sair struggle, for they would hae me to take one o’ their hard-earned shillings; but I would by no means hear o’ it, and I was the more positive as they had telt me that I was but a day’s journey or so frae Richmond, and need na gang through that awfu’ London, which was a great ease to my mind. So I took only some small change Ellen had gotten in from the tea, and gaed on my way. It was a clear bright day, but it was hard frost when night came on, and I was stiff wi’ cold, and weary, weary; and I could get naething better than a barn to lie down in, for I had but a penny to offer, and they jeered at me, and said a barn was ower good for sic payment. The next morning seems all like a confused kind o’ dream, I remember naething but that I crawled on and on, often stopping and feeling unco’ sleepy, but aye feared to lie down lest I should ne’er waken again; but though I kent Richmond could na be far off now, I was but the mair sorrowful, for I could bear it no longer; I could na move anither step, but sunk down by the road-side. A mist came afore my eyes, I ken naething mair, but that I seemed to waken in Heaven, for when I opened my eyes again, your dear faces were all around me.” Peggy ceased speaking, and clasped her hands together as if in prayer. There were tears in most eyes; even Charles, who seemed to think it unmanly to give way, had to struggle hard with his emotion.
