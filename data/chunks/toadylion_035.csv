"CHAPTER XXXV. PRISSY'S COMPROMISE.  After the turmoil and excitement of the notably adventurous days which ended with the capture of the castle, the succeeding weeks dragged strangely. The holidays were dwindling as quickly as the last grains of sand in an hourglass, and there was an uneasy feeling in the air that the end of old and the beginning of new things were alike at hand. Mr. Picton Smith returned from London the day after the great battle. That afternoon he was closeted for a long time with Mr. Burnham, but not even the venturesome Sir Toady Lion on his hands and knees, could overhear what the two gentlemen had to say to each other. At all events Mr. Smith did not this time attempt to force any confession from the active combatants. His failure on a former occasion had been complete enough, and he had no desire once more to confess himself worsted by Hugh John's determination to abjure all that savoured even remotely of the ""dasht-mean."" But it is certain that the Smoutchy ringleaders were not further punished, and Mr. Smith took no steps to enforce the interdict which he had obtained against trespassers on the castle island. For it was about this time that Prissy, having taken a great deal of trouble to understand all the bearings of the case, at last, with a brave heart, went and knocked at her father's study door. ""Come in,"" said the deep grave voice instantly, sending a thrill through the closed door, which made her tremble and rather wish that she had not come. ""Saint Catherine of Siena would not have been afraid,"" she murmured to herself, and forthwith opened the door. ""Well, little girl, what is it? What can I do for you?"" said her father, smiling upon her; for he had heard of her ambassadorial picnic to the Smoutchies, and perhaps his daughter's trustful gentleness had made him a little ashamed of his own severity. Prissy stood nerving herself to speak the words which were in her heart. She had seen Peace and kindly Concord bless her mission from afar; and now, like Paul before King Agrippa, she would not be unfaithful to the heavenly vision. ""Father,"" she said at last, ""you don't really want to keep people out of the castle altogether, do you?"" ""Certainly not, if they behave themselves,"" said her father, ""but the mischief is that they don't."" ""But suppose, father, that there was some one always there to see that they did behave, would you mind?"" ""Of course not,"" replied her father, ""but you know, Prissy, I can't afford to keep a man down on the island to see that sixpenny trippers don't pull down my castle stone by stone, or break their own necks by falling into the dungeon."" Prissy thought a little while, and then tried a new tack. ""Father""--she went a little nearer to him and stroked the cuff of his coat-sleeve--""does the land beyond the bridge belong to you?"" Mr. Picton Smith moved away his hand. Her mother used to do just that, and somehow the memory hurt. Nevertheless, all unconsciously, the touch of the child's hand softened him. ""No, Prissy,"" he said wonderingly, ""but what do you know about such things?"" ""Nothing at all,"" she answered, ""but I am trying to learn. I want everybody to love you, and think you as nice as I know you to be. Don't you think you could let some one you knew very well live in the little lodge by the white bridge, and keep out the horrid people, or see that they behaved themselves?"" ""The town would never agree to that,"" said her father, not seeing where he was being led. ""Don't you think the town's people would if you gave them the sixpences all for themselves?"" Her father pushed back his chair in great astonishment and looked at Prissy. ""Little girl,"" he said very gravely, ""who has been putting all this into your head? Has anybody told you to come to me about this?"" Prissy shook her head quickly, then she looked down as if embarrassed. ""Well, what is it? Go on!"" said her father, but the words were more softly spoken than you would think only to see them printed. ""Nobody told me about anything--I just thought about it all myself, father,"" she answered, taking courage from a certain look in Mr. Smith's eyes; ""once I heard you say that the money was what the town's-people cared about. And--and--well, I knew that Jane Housemaid wanted to get married to Tom Cannon, and you see they can't, because Tom has not enough wages to take a house."" Prissy was speaking very fast now, rattling out the words so as to be finished before her father could interpose with any grown-up questions or objections. ""And you know I remembered last night when I was lying awake that Catherine would have done this----"" ""What Catherine?"" said her father, who did not always follow his daughter's reasoning. ""Saint Catherine of Siena, of course,"" said Prissy, for whom there was no other of the name; ""so I came to you, and I want you to let Tom and Jane have the cottage, and Jane can take up the sixpences in a little brass plate like the one Mr. Burnham gets from the churchwardens on Sunday. And, oh! but I would just love to help her. May I sometimes, father?"" ""Well,"" said her father, laughing, ""there is perhaps something in what you say; but I don't think the Provost and Magistrates would ever agree. Now run away and play, and I will see what can be done."" But all the same Prissy did not go and play, and it was not Mr. Picton Smith who saw what could be done. On the afternoon of the same day the Provost of the good town of Edam entered the Council Chamber wiping his face and panting vigorously. He was a stout man of much good humour when not crossed in temper, the leading chemist and druggist in the town, and as the proprietor of more houses and less education than any man in Edam, of very great influence among the councillors. ""Well, billies,"" he cried jovially, ""what do you think? There's a lass has keep'd me from the meetin' of this council for a full half-hour."" ""A lass!"" answered the senior bailie, still more hilariously, ""that's surely less than proper. I will be compelled to inform Mrs. Lamont of the fact."" ""Oh, it was a lassie of twelve or thirteen,"" answered the Provost. ""So none of your insinuations, Bailie Tawse, and I'll thank you. She had a most astonishing tale to tell. It appears she is Picton Smith's lassie from Windy Standard; and she says to me, says she, 'Provost, do you want to have the tourist folk that come to Edam admitted to the castle?' says she. 'Of course,' says I, 'that is what the law-plea is about. That dust is no settled yet.' 'Then,' says she, brisk as if she was hiring me at Yedam fair, 'suppose my father was willing to let ye charge a sixpence for admission, would you pay a capable man his wages summer and winter to look after it--a man that my father would approve of?' 'Aye,' says I, 'the council would be blythe and proud to do that'--me thinking of my sister's son Peter that was injured by a lamp-post falling against him last New Year's night as he was coming hame frae the Blue Bell. 'Then,' says she, 'I think it can be managed. My father will put Tom Cannon in the lodge at the white bridge. You will pay him ten shillings in the week for his wife looking after the gate and taking the parties over the castle.' 'His wife,' says I; 'Tom is no married that ever I heard.' 'No,' says she, 'but he will be very quick if he gets the lodge.' Then I thocht that somebody had put her up to all this, and I questioned her tightly. But no--certes, she is a clever lass. I verily believe if I had said the word she would hae comed along here to the council meeting and faced the pack o' ye. But I said to her that she might gang her ways hame, and that I would put the matter before the council mysel'!""
