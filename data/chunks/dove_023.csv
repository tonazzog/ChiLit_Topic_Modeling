"CHAPTER XXII. PEACE  SLOWLY and painfully did Ebbo recover from his swoon, feeling as if the means of revival were rending him away from his brother.  He was so completely spent that he was satisfied with a mere assurance that nothing was amiss, and presently dropped into a profound slumber, whence he awoke to find it still broad daylight, and his mother sitting by the side of his bed, all looking so much as it had done for the last six weeks, that his first inquiry was if all that had happened had been but a strange dream.  His mother would scarcely answer till she had satisfied herself that his eye was clear, his voice steady, his hand cool, and that, as she said, “That Kaisar had done him no harm.” “Ah, then it was true!  Where is he?  Gone?” cried Ebbo, eagerly. “No, in the hall below, busy with letters they have brought him.  Lie still, my boy; he has done thee quite enough damage for one day.” “But, mother, what are you saying!  Something disloyal, was it not?” “Well, Ebbo, I was very angry that he should have half killed you when he could so easily have spoken one word.  Heaven forgive me if I did wrong, but I could not help it.” “Did _he_ forgive you, mother?” said Ebbo, anxiously. “He—oh yes.  To do him justice he was greatly concerned; devised ways of restoring thee, and now has promised not to come near thee again without my leave,” said the mother, quite as persuaded of her own rightful sway in her son’s sick chamber as ever Kunigunde had been of her dominion over the castle. “And is he displeased with me?  Those cowardly vindictive rascals, to fall on him, and set me at nought!  Before him, too!” exclaimed Ebbo, bitterly. “Nay, Ebbo, he thought thy part most gallant.  I heard him say so, not only to me, but below stairs—both wise and true.  Thou didst know him then?” “From the first glance of his princely eye—the first of his keen smiles. I had seen him disguised before.  I thought you knew him too, mother; I never guessed that your mind was running on Schlangenwald when we talked at cross purposes last night.” “Would that I had; but though I breathed no word openly, I encouraged Heinz’s precautions.  My boy, I could not help it; my heart would tremble for my only one, and I saw he could not be what he seemed.” “And what doth he here?  Who were the men who were advancing?” “They were the followers he had left at St. Ruprecht’s, and likewise Master Schleiermacher and Sir Kasimir of Wildschloss.” “What—he had not told thee?” “No.  He knew that I knew him, was at no pains to disguise himself, yet evidently meant me to treat him as a private knight.  But what brought Wildschloss here?” “It seems,” said Christina, “that, on the return from Carinthia, the Kaisar expressed his intention of slipping away from his army in his own strange fashion, and himself inquiring into the matter of the Ford.  So he took with him his own personal followers, the new Graf von Schlangenwald, Herr Kasimir, and Master Schleiermacher.  The others he sent to Schlangenwald; he himself lodged at St. Ruprecht’s, appointing that Sir Kasimir should meet him there this morning.  From the convent he started on a chamois hunt, and made his way hither; but, when the snow came on, and he returned not, his followers became uneasy, and came in search of him.” “Ah!” said Ebbo, “he meant to intercede for Wildschloss—it might be he would have tried his power.  No, for that he is too generous.  How looked Wildschloss, mother?” “How could I tell how any one looked save thee, my poor wan boy?  Thou art paler than ever!  I cannot have any king or kaisar of them all come to trouble thee.” “Nay, motherling, there is much more trouble and unrest to me in not knowing how my king will treat us after such a requital!  Prithee let him know that I am at his service.” And, after having fed and refreshed her patient, the gentle potentate of his chamber consented to intimate her consent to admit the invader.  But not till after delay enough to fret the impatient nerves of illness did Maximilian appear, handing her in, and saying, in the cheery voice that was one of his chief fascinations, “Yea, truly, fair dame, I know thou wouldst sooner trust Schlangenwald himself than me alone with thy charge.  How goes it, my true knight?” “Well, right well, my liege,” said Ebbo, “save for my shame and grief.” “Thou art the last to be ashamed for that,” said the good-natured prince. “Have I never seen my faithful vassals more bent on their own feuds than on my word?—I who reign over a set of kings, who brook no will but their own.” “And may we ask your pardon,” said Ebbo, “not only for ourselves, but for the misguided men-at-arms?” “What! the grewsome giant that was prepared with the axe, and the honest lad that wanted to do his duty by his father?  I honour that lad, Freiherr; I would enrol him in my guard, but that probably he is better off here than with _Massimiliano pochi danari_, as the Italians call me. But what I came hither to say was this,” and he spoke gravely: “thou art sincere in desiring reconciliation with the house of Schlangenwald?” “With all my heart,” said Ebbo, “do I loathe the miserable debt of blood for blood!” “And,” said Maximilian, “Graf Dankwart is of like mind.  Bred from pagedom in his Prussian commandery, he has never been exposed to the irritations that have fed the spirit of strife, and he will be thankful to lay it aside.  The question next is how to solemnize this reconciliation, ere your retainers on one side or the other do something to set you by the ears together again, which, judging by this morning’s work, is not improbable.” “Alas! no,” said Ebbo, “while I am laid by.” “Had you both been in our camp, you should have sworn friendship in my chapel.  Now must Dankwart come hither to thee, as I trow he had best do, while I am here to keep the peace.  See, friend Ebbo, we will have him here to-morrow; thy chaplain shall deck the altar here, the Father Abbot shall say mass, and ye shall swear peace and brotherhood before me. And,” he added, taking Ebbo’s hand, “I shall know how to trust thine oaths as of one who sets the fear of God above that of his king.” This was truly the only chance of impressing on the wild vassals of the two houses an obligation that perhaps might override their ancient hatred; and the Baron and his mother gladly submitted to the arrangement. Maximilian withdrew to give directions for summoning the persons required and Christina was soon obliged to leave her son, while she provided for her influx of guests. Ebbo was alone till nearly the end of the supper below stairs.  He had been dozing, when a cautious tread came up the turret steps, and he started, and called out, “Who goes there?  I am not asleep.” “It is your kinsman, Freiherr,” said a well-known voice; “I come by your mother’s leave.” “Welcome, Sir Cousin,” said Ebbo, holding out his hand.  “You come to find everything changed.” “I have knelt in the chapel,” said Wildschloss, gravely. “And he loved you better than I!” said Ebbo. “Your jealousy of me was a providential thing, for which all may be thankful,” said Wildschloss gravely; “yet it is no small thing to lose the hope of so many years!  However, young Baron, I have grave matter for your consideration.  Know you the service on which I am to be sent?  The Kaisar deems that the Armenians or some of the Christian nations on the skirts of the Ottoman empire might be made our allies, and attack the Turk in his rear.  I am chosen as his envoy, and shall sail so soon as I can make my way to Venice.  I only knew of the appointment since I came hither, he having been led thereto by letters brought him this day; and mayhap by the downfall of my hopes.  He was peremptory, as his mood is, and seemed to think it no small favour,” added Wildschloss, with some annoyance.  “And meantime, what of my poor child?  There she is in the cloister at Ulm, but an inheritance is a very mill-stone round the neck of an orphan maid.  That insolent fellow, Lassla von Trautbach, hath already demanded to espouse the poor babe; he—a blood-stained, dicing, drunken rover, with whom I would not trust a dog that I loved!  Yet my death would place her at the disposal of his father, who would give her at once to him.  Nay, even his aunt, the abbess, will believe nothing against him, and hath even striven with me to have her betrothed at once. On the barest rumour of my death will they wed the poor little thing, and then woe to her, and woe to my vassals!” ",peace recover swoon feel means revival rend brother spend satisfy mere assurance amiss drop profound slumber awoke find broad daylight mother sit side bed last week first inquiry happen strange dream mother answer satisfy eye clear voice steady hand cool harm true gone cry hall busy letter bring lie boy enough damage day mother disloyal angry half kill speak word heaven forgive wrong help forgive mother justice concerned devise way restore promise leave mother persuade own rightful sway son sick chamber dominion castle displeased cowardly vindictive rascal fall set nought exclaim part gallant hear stair wise true first glance princely eye first keen smile disguise mother guess mind run talk cross purpose last night breathe word encourage precaution boy help heart tremble only one seem man advance follower leave  pain disguise mean treat private knight bring seem return express intention slip army own strange fashion inquire matter own personal follower new other send lodg appoint meet morning convent start chamois hunt way snow return follower become uneasy search mean intercede try power generous mother one poor want boy art paler king kaisar trouble motherling more trouble unrest king treat requital let service feed refresh patient gentle potentate chamber consent intimate consent admit invader delay fret impatient nerve illness appear hand cheery voice chief fascination fair dame trust charge true knight liege save shame grief art last ashamed natured prince faithful vassal bend own feud word reign set king briok will own ask pardon misguided man arm grewsome giant prepare axe honest lad want duty father honour lad enrol guard call speak art sincere desire reconciliation house heart loathe miserable debt blood blood mind bre pagedom prussian commandery expose irritation feed spirit strife thankful lay question solemnize reconciliation retainer side other set ear judge morning work improbable lay camp swear friendship chapel trow keep peace friend chaplain deck altar mass swear peace brotherhood add hand trust oath set fear king only chance impress wild vassal house obligation override ancient hatred mother submit arrangement withdraw give direction summon person require oblige leave son provide influx guest alone end supper stair doze cautious tread turret step start call asleep kinsman voice mother leave hold hand find change knolt chapel love jealousy providential thing thankful small thing lose hope many year young grave matter consideration service send deem christian nation skirt ottoman empire ally attack rear choose envoy sail way appointment lead letter bring day mayhap downfall hope peremptory mood seem small favour add annoyance meantime poor child cloister inheritance mill stone neck orphan maid insolent fellow demand espouse poor babe blood stain dice drunken rover trust dog love death place disposal father give aunt abbess believe strive betroth barest rumour death wed poor thing woe woe vassal 
"“The King,” suggested Ebbo.  “Surely she might be made his ward.” “Young man,” said Sir Kasimir, bending over him, and speaking in an undertone, “he may well have won your heart.  As friend, when one is at his side, none can be so winning, or so sincere as he; but with all his brilliant gifts, he says truly of himself that he is a mere reckless huntsman.  To-day, while I am with him, he would give me half Austria, or fight single-handed in my cause or Thekla’s.  Next month, when I am out of sight, comes Trautbach, just when his head is full of keeping the French out of Italy, or reforming the Church, or beating the Turk, or parcelling the empire into circles, or, maybe, of a new touch-hole for a cannon—nay, of a flower-garden, or of walking into a lion’s den.  He just says, ‘Yea, well,’ to be rid of the importunity, and all is over with my poor little maiden.  Hare-brained and bewildered with schemes has he been as Romish King—how will it be with him as Kaisar?  It is but of his wonted madness that he is here at all, when his Austrian states must be all astray for want of him.  No, no; I would rather make a weathercock guardian to my daughter.  You yourself are the only guard to whom I can safely intrust her.” “My sword as knight and kinsman—” began Ebbo. “No, no; ’tis no matter of errant knight or distressed damsel.  That is King Max’s own line!” said Wildschloss, with a little of the irony that used to nettle Ebbo.  “There is only one way in which you can save her, and that is as her husband.” Ebbo started, as well he might, but Sir Kasimir laid his hand on him with a gesture that bade him listen ere he spoke.  “My first wish for my child,” he said, “was to see her brought up by that peerless lady below stairs.  The saints—in pity to one so like themselves—spared her the distress our union would have brought her.  Now, it would be vain to place my little Thekla in her care, for Trautbach would easily feign my death, and claim his niece, nor are you of age to be made her guardian as head of our house.  But, if this marriage rite were solemnized, then would her person and lands alike be yours, and I could leave her with an easy heart.” “But,” said the confused, surprised Ebbo, “what can I do?  They say I shall not walk for many weeks to come.  And, even if I could, I am so young—I have so blundered in my dealings with my own mountaineers, and with this fatal bridge—how should I manage such estates as yours?  Some better—” “Look you, Ebbo,” said Wildschloss; “you have erred—you have been hasty; but tell me where to find another youth, whose strongest purpose was as wise as your errors, or who cared for others’ good more than for his own violence and vainglory?  Brief as your time has been, one knows when one is on your bounds by the aspect of your serfs, the soundness of their dwellings, the prosperity of their crops and cattle above all, by their face and tone if one asks for their lord.” “Ah! it was Friedel they loved.  They scarce knew me from Friedel.” “Such as you are, with all the blunders you have made and will make, you are the only youth I know to whom I could intrust my child or my lands. The old Wildschloss castle is a male fief, and would return to you, but there are domains since granted that will cause intolerable trouble and strife, unless you and my poor little heiress are united.  As for age, you are—?” “Eighteen next Easter.” “Then there are scarce eleven years between you.  You will find the little one a blooming bride when your first deeds in arms have been fought out.” “And, if my mother trains her up,” said Ebbo, thoughtfully, “she will be all the better daughter to her.  But, Sir Cousin, you know I too must be going.  So soon as I can brook the saddle, I must seek out and ransom my father.” “That is like to be a far shorter and safer journey than mine.  The Genoese and Venetians understand traffic with the infidels for their captives, and only by your own fault could you get into danger.  Even at the worst, should mishap befall you, you could so order matters as to leave your girl-widow in your mother’s charge.” “Then,” added Ebbo, “she would still have one left to love and cherish her.  Sir Kasimir, it is well; though, if you knew me without my Friedel, you would repent of your bargain.” “Thanks from my heart,” said Wildschloss, “but you need not be concerned. You have never been over-friendly with me even with Friedel at your side. But to business, my son.  You will endure that title from me now?  My time is short.” “What would you have me do?  Shall I send the little one a betrothal ring, and ride to Ulm to wed and fetch her home in spring?” “That may hardly serve.  These kinsmen would have seized on her and the castle long ere that time.  The only safety is the making wedlock as fast as it can be made with a child of such tender years.  Mine is the only power that can make the abbess give her up, and therefore will I ride this moonlight night to Ulm, bring the little one back with me by the time the reconciliation be concluded, and then shall ye be wed by the Abbot of St. Ruprecht’s, with the Kaisar for a witness, and thus will the knot be too strong for the Trautbachs to untie.” Ebbo looked disconcerted, and gasped, as if this were over-quick work.—“To-morrow!” he said.  “Knows my mother?” “I go to speak with her at once.  The Kaisar’s consent I have, as he says, ‘If we have one vassal who has common sense and honesty, let us make the most of him.’  Ah! my son, I shall return to see you his counsellor and friend.” Those days had no delicacies as to the lady’s side taking the initiative: and, in effect, the wealth and power of Wildschloss so much exceeded those of the elder branch that it would have been presumptuous on Eberhard’s part to have made the proposal.  It was more a treaty than an affair of hearts, and Sir Kasimir had not even gone through the form of inquiring if Ebbo were fancy-free.  It was true, indeed, that he was still a boy, with no passion for any one but his mother; but had he even formed a dream of a ladye love, it would scarcely have been deemed a rational objection.  The days of romance were no days of romance in marriage. Yet Christina, wedded herself for pure love, felt this obstacle strongly. The scheme was propounded to her over the hall fire by no less a person than Maximilian himself, and he, whose perceptions were extremely keen when he was not too much engrossed to use them, observed her reluctance through all her timid deference, and probed her reasons so successfully that she owned at last that, though it might sound like folly, she could scarce endure to see her son so bind himself that the romance of his life could hardly be innocent. “Nay, lady,” was the answer, in a tone of deep feeling.  “Neither lands nor honours can weigh down the up-springing of true love;” and he bowed his head between his hands. Verily, all the Low Countries had not impeded the true-hearted affection of Maximilian and Mary; and, though since her death his want of self-restraint had marred his personal character and morals, and though he was now on the point of concluding a most loveless political marriage, yet still Mary was—as he shows her as the Beatrice of both his strange autobiographical allegories—the guiding star of his fitful life; and in heart his fidelity was so unbroken that, when after a long pause he again looked up to Christina, he spoke as well understanding her feelings.
