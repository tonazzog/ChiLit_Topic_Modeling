" Jack's ingenuity--We get into difficulties about fishing, and get out of them by a method which gives us a cold bath--Horrible encounter with a shark. For several days after the excursion related in the last chapter we did not wander far from our encampment, but gave ourselves up to forming plans for the future and making our present abode comfortable. There were various causes that induced this state of comparative inaction.  In the first place, although everything around us was so delightful, and we could without difficulty obtain all that we required for our bodily comfort, we did not quite like the idea of settling down here for the rest of our lives, far away from our friends and our native land.  To set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence seemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and friends for ever, that we tacitly shrank from it and put off our preparations, for one reason and another, as long as we could.  Then there was a little uncertainty still as to there being natives on the island, and we entertained a kind of faint hope that a ship might come and take us off. But as day after day passed, and neither savages nor ships appeared, we gave up all hope of an early deliverance and set diligently to work at our homestead. During this time, however, we had not been altogether idle.  We made several experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut, most of which did not improve it.  Then we removed our goods, and took up our abode in the cave, but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower. Besides this we bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal; at least Jack and Peterkin did,--I listened.  Among other useful things, Jack, who was ever the most active and diligent, converted about three inches of the hoop-iron into an excellent knife.  First he beat it quite flat with the axe.  Then he made a rude handle, and tied the hoop-iron to it with our piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge on a piece of sand-stone.  When it was finished he used it to shape a better handle, to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchief;--in which operation he had, as Peterkin pointed out, torn off one of Lord Nelson's noses.  However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by Peterkin as a fishing line.  He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end of it.  This the fish were allowed to swallow, and then they were pulled quickly ashore.  But as the line was very short and we had no boat, the fish we caught were exceedingly small. One day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been angling, and said in a very cross tone, ""I'll tell you what, Jack, I'm not going to be humbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer.  I want you to swim out with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!"" ""Dear me, Peterkin,"" replied Jack, ""I had no idea you were taking the thing so much to heart, else I would have got you out of that difficulty long ago.  Let me see,""--and Jack looked down at a piece of timber on which he had been labouring, with a peculiar gaze of abstraction, which he always assumed when trying to invent or discover anything. ""What say you to building a boat?"" he inquired, looking up hastily. ""Take far too long,"" was the reply; ""can't be bothered waiting.  I want to begin at once!"" Again Jack considered.  ""I have it!"" he cried.  ""We'll fell a large tree and launch the trunk of it in the water, so that when you want to fish you've nothing to do but to swim out to it."" ""Would not a small raft do better?"" said I. ""Much better; but we have no ropes to bind it together with.  Perhaps we may find something hereafter that will do as well, but, in the meantime, let us try the tree."" This was agreed on, so we started off to a spot not far distant, where we knew of a tree that would suit us, which grew near the water's edge.  As soon as we reached it Jack threw off his coat, and, wielding the axe with his sturdy arms, hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour without stopping.  Then he paused, and, while he sat down to rest, I continued the work.  Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on it, so that when Jack renewed his powerful blows, a few minutes cutting brought it down with a terrible crash. ""Hurrah! now for it,"" cried Jack; ""let us off with its head."" So saying he began to cut through the stem again, at about six yards from the thick end.  This done, he cut three strong, short poles or levers from the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the beach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large end, we could not move it without such helps.  With the levers, however, we rolled it slowly into the sea. Having been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next shaped the levers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted to embark.  This was easy enough to do; but, after seating ourselves astride the log, it was with the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and plunging us into the water.  Not that we minded that much; but we preferred, if possible, to fish in dry clothes.  To be sure, our trousers were necessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on each side of the log; but, as they could be easily dried, we did not care.  After half an hour's practice, we became expert enough to keep our balance pretty steadily.  Then Peterkin laid down his paddle, and having baited his line with a whole oyster, dropt it into deep water. ""Now, then, Jack,"" said he, ""be cautious; steer clear o' that sea-weed. There; that's it; gently, now, gently.  I see a fellow at least a foot long down there, coming to--ha! that's it!  Oh! bother, he's off."" ""Did he bite?"" said Jack, urging the log onwards a little with his paddle. ""Bite? ay!  He took it into his mouth, but the moment I began to haul he opened his jaws and let it out again."" ""Let him swallow it next time,"" said Jack, laughing at the melancholy expression of Peterkin's visage. ""There he's again,"" cried Peterkin, his eyes flashing with excitement. ""Look out!  Now then!  No!  Yes!  No!  Why, the brute _won't_ swallow it!"" ""Try to haul him up by the mouth, then,"" cried Jack.  ""Do it gently."" A heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor Peterkin had tried and failed again. ""Never mind, lad,"" said Jack, in a voice of sympathy; ""we'll move on, and offer it to some other fish.""  So saying, Jack plied his paddle; but scarcely had he moved from the spot, when a fish with an enormous head and a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at once.
