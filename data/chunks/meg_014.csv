"CHAPTER XIV. Little Meg's Farewell About a month after Robert Fleming's return Dr Christie paid a visit to Mrs Blossom's little house.  He had been there before, but this was a special visit; and it was evident some important plan had to be decided upon.  Dr Christie came to hear what Mrs Blossom had to say about it. 'Well, sir,' said Mrs Blossom, 'a woman of my years, as always lived in one village all her life till I came to London, it do seem a great move to go across the sea.  But as you all think as it 'ud be a good thing for Posy, and as Mr Fleming do wish little Meg and Robin to go along with us, which are like my own children, and as he's to be in the same ship, I'm not the woman to say No.  I'm a good hand at washing and ironing, and sewing, and keeping a little shop, or anything else as turns up; and there's ten years' good work in me yet; by which time little Meg'll be a stout, grown-up young woman; to say nothing of Posy, who's old enough to get her own living now.  I can't say as I like the sea, quite the contrairy; but I can put up with it; and Mr Fleming'll be there to see as the ship goes all right, and doesn't lose hisself. So I'll be ready by the time the ship's ready.' They were all ready in time as Mrs Blossom had promised, for there were not many preparations to be made.  Little Meg's red frock was taken out of pawn, with all the other things, and Mrs Blossom went down to her native village to visit it for the last time; but Posy shrank from being seen there by the neighbours again.  She, and Meg, and Robin went once more for a farewell look at Temple Gardens.  It was the first time she had been in the streets since she had gone back to her mother, and she seemed ashamed and alarmed at every eye that met hers.  When they stood looking at the river, with its swift, cruel current, Posy shivered and trembled until she was obliged to turn away and sit down on a bench.  She was glad, she said, to get home again, and she would go out no more till the day came when Mr George drove them all down to the docks, with the few boxes which contained their worldly goods. Dr Christie and his wife were down at the ship to see them off, and they kissed Meg tenderly as they bade her farewell.  When the last minute was nearly come, Mr George took little Meg's small hand in his large one, and laid the other upon her head. 'Little woman, tell us that verse again,' he said, 'that verse as you've always gone and believed in, and acted on.' 'That as mother and me heard preached from the streets?' asked Meg. Mr George nodded silently. 'It's quite true,' said little Meg, in a tone of perfect confidence, 'because it's in the Bible, and Jesus said it.  Besides, God did everythink I asked Him.  ""If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?""'
