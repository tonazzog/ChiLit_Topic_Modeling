"CHAPTER VI. ""THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING--THERE WAS!""  The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud.  There could be no going out today. ""What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?"" she asked Martha. ""Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,"" Martha answered. ""Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.  Mother's a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered.  The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays there.  Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet.  He goes out just th' same as if th' sun was shinin'. He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when it's fair weather.  He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep it warm.  Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead.  He's got it at home now.  He found a half-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an' tamed it.  It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies about with him everywhere."" The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiar talk.  She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away.  The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat.  The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies.  Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When Martha told stories of what ""mother"" said or did they always sounded comfortable. ""If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,"" said Mary.  ""But I have nothing."" Martha looked perplexed. ""Can tha' knit?"" she asked. ""No,"" answered Mary. ""Can tha' sew?"" ""Can tha' read?"" ""Then why doesn't tha, read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'? Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now."" ""I haven't any books,"" said Mary.  ""Those I had were left in India."" ""That's a pity,"" said Martha.  ""If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there."" Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea.  She made up her mind to go and find it herself.  She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock.  Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room downstairs. In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all.  In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way. Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one troubled themselves about her in the least.  Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do.  She supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children.  In India she had always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot.  She had often been tired of her company.  Now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on. ""Hasn't tha' got good sense?"" she said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her.  ""Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an' she's only four year' old.  Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head."" Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things. She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs.  She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library.  She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors.  She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them.  Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many doors she could count? It would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out.  She had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her. She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began her wanderings.  It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again.  There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls.  Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet.  She found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits.  She had never thought there could be so many in any house.  She walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house.  Some were pictures of children--little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks.  She always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes.  There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself.  She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger.  Her eyes had a sharp, curious look. ""Where do you live now?"" said Mary aloud to her.  ""I wish you were here."" Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning.  It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked.  Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true. It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door.  All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.  She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened.  It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom.  There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room.  A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.
