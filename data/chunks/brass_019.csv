" On a certain evening in May Horace Ventimore dined in a private room at the Savoy, as one of the guests of Mr. Samuel Wackerbath. In fact, he might almost be said to be the guest of the evening, as the dinner was given by way of celebrating the completion of the host's new country house at Lipsfield, of which Horace was the architect, and also to congratulate him on his approaching marriage (which was fixed to take place early in the following month) with Miss Sylvia Futvoye. ""Quite a small and friendly party!"" said Mr. Wackerbath, looking round on his numerous sons and daughters, as he greeted Horace in the reception-room. ""Only ourselves, you see, Miss Futvoye, a young lady with whom you are fairly well acquainted, and her people, and an old schoolfellow of mine and his wife, who are not yet arrived. He's a man of considerable eminence,"" he added, with a roll of reflected importance in his voice; ""quite worth your cultivating. Sir Lawrence Pountney, his name is. I don't know if you remember him, but he discharged the onerous duties of Lord Mayor of London the year before last, and acquitted himself very creditably--in fact, he got a baronetcy for it."" As the year before last was the year in which Horace had paid his involuntary visit to the Guildhall, he was able to reply with truth that he _did_ remember Sir Lawrence. He was not altogether comfortable when the ex-Lord-Mayor was announced, for it would have been more than awkward if Sir Lawrence had chanced to remember _him_. Fortunately, he gave no sign that he did so, though his manner was graciousness itself. ""Delighted, my dear Mr. Ventimore,"" he said pressing Horace's hand almost as warmly as he had done that October day of the dais, ""most delighted to make your acquaintance! I am always glad to meet a rising young man, and I hear that the house you have designed for my old friend here is a perfect palace--a marvel, sir!"" ""I knew he was my man,"" declared Mr. Wackerbath, as Horace modestly disclaimed Sir Lawrence's compliment. ""You remember, Pountney, my dear fellow, that day when we were crossing Westminster Bridge together, and I was telling you I thought of building? 'Go to one of the leading men--an R.A. and all that sort of thing,' you said, 'then you'll be sure of getting your money's worth.' But I said, 'No, I like to choose for myself; to--ah--exercise my own judgment in these matters. And there's a young fellow I have in my eye who'll beat 'em all, if he's given the chance. I'm off to see him now.' And off I went to Great Cloister Street (for he hadn't those palatial offices of his in Victoria Street at that time) without losing another instant, and dropped in on him with my little commission. Didn't I, Ventimore?"" ""You did indeed,"" said Horace, wondering how far these reminiscences would go. ""And,"" continued Mr. Wackerbath, patting Horace on the shoulder, ""from that day to this I've never had a moment's reason to regret it. We've worked in perfect sympathy. His ideas coincided with mine. I think he found that I met him, so to speak, on all fours."" Ventimore assented, though it struck him that a happier expression might, and would, have been employed if his client had remembered one particular interview in which he had not figured to advantage. They went in to dinner, in a room sumptuously decorated with panels of grey-green brocade and softly shaded lamps, and screens of gilded leather; through the centre of the table rose a tall palm, its boughs hung with small electric globes like magic fruits. ""This palm,"" said the Professor, who was in high good humour, ""really gives quite an Oriental look to the table. Personally, I think we might reproduce the Arabian style of decoration and arrangement generally in our homes with great advantage. I often wonder it never occurred to my future son-in-law there to turn his talents in that direction and design an Oriental interior for himself. Nothing more comfortable and luxurious--for a bachelor's purposes."" ""I'm sure,"" said his wife, ""Horace managed to make himself quite comfortable enough as it was. He has the most delightful rooms in Vincent Square."" Ventimore heard her remark to Sir Lawrence: ""I shall never forget the first time we dined there, just after my daughter and he were engaged. I was quite astonished: everything was so perfect--quite simple, you know, but _so_ ingeniously arranged, and his landlady such an excellent cook, too! Still, of course, in many ways, it will be nicer for him to have a home of his own."" ""With such a beautiful and charming companion to share it with,"" said Sir Lawrence, in his most florid manner, ""the--ah--poorest home would prove a Paradise indeed! And I suppose now, my dear young lady,"" he added, raising his voice to address Sylvia, ""you are busy making your future abode as exquisite as taste and research can render it, ransacking all the furniture shops in London for treasures, and going about to auctions--or do you--ah--delegate that department to Mr. Ventimore?"" ""I do go about to old furniture shops, Sir Lawrence,"" she said, ""but not auctions. I'm afraid I should only get just the thing I didn't want if I tried to bid.... And,"" she added, in a lower voice, turning to Horace, ""I don't believe _you_ would be a bit more successful, Horace!"" ""What makes you say that, Sylvia?"" he asked, with a start. ""Why, do you mean to say you've forgotten how you went to that auction for papa, and came away without having managed to get a single thing?"" she said. ""What a short memory you must have!"" There was only tender mockery in her eyes; absolutely no recollection of the sinister purchase he had made at that sale, or how nearly it had separated them for ever. So he hastened to admit that perhaps he had _not_ been particularly successful at the auction in question. Sir Lawrence next addressed him across the table. ""I was just telling Mrs. Futvoye,"" he said, ""how much I regretted that I had not the privilege of your acquaintance during my year of office. A Lord Mayor, as you doubtless know, has exceptional facilities for exercising hospitality, and it would have afforded me real pleasure if your first visit to the Guildhall could have been paid under my--hm--ha--auspices."" ""You are very kind,"" said Horace, very much on his guard; ""I could not wish to pay it under better."" ""I flatter myself,"" said the ex-Lord Mayor, ""that, while in office, I did my humble best to maintain the traditions of the City, and I was fortunate enough to have the honour of receiving more than the average number of celebrities as guests. But I had one great disappointment, I must tell you. It had always been a dream of mine that it might fall to my lot to present some distinguished fellow-countryman with the freedom of the City. By some curious chance, when the opportunity seemed about to occur, the thing was put off and I missed it--missed it by the nearest hair-breadth!"" ""Ah, well, Sir Lawrence,"" said Ventimore, ""one can't have _everything_!"" ""For my part,"" put in Lady Pountney, who had only caught a word or two of her husband's remarks, ""what _I_ miss most is having the sentinels present arms whenever I went out for a drive. They did it so nicely and respectfully. I confess I enjoyed that. My husband never cared much for it. Indeed, he wouldn't even use the State coach unless he was absolutely obliged. He was as obstinate as a mule about it!""

"""I see, Lady Pountney,"" the Professor put in, ""that you share the common prejudice against mules. It's quite a mistaken one. The mule has never been properly appreciated in this country. He is really the gentlest and most docile of creatures!"" ""I can't say I like them myself,"" said Lady Pountney; ""such a mongrel sort of animal--neither one thing nor the other!"" ""And they're hideous too, Anthony,"" added his wife. ""And not at all clever!"" ""There you're mistaken, my dear,"" said the Professor; ""they are capable of almost human intelligence. I have had considerable personal experience of what a mule can do,"" he informed Lady Pountney, who seemed still incredulous. ""More than most people indeed, and I can assure you, my dear Lady Pountney, that they readily adapt themselves to almost any environment, and will endure the greatest hardships without exhibiting any signs of distress. I see by your expression, Ventimore, that you don't agree with me, eh?"" Horace had to set his teeth hard for a moment, lest he should disgrace himself by a peal of untimely mirth--but by a strong effort of will he managed to command his muscles. ""Well, sir,"" he said, ""I've only chanced to come into close contact with one mule in my life, and, frankly, I've no desire to repeat the experience."" ""You happened to come upon an unfavourable specimen, that's all,"" said the Professor. ""There are exceptions to every rule."" ""This animal,"" Horace said, ""was certainly exceptional enough in every way."" ""Do tell us all about it,"" pleaded one of the Miss Wackerbaths, and all the ladies joined in the entreaty until Horace found himself under the necessity of improvising a story, which, it must be confessed, fell exceedingly flat. This final ordeal past, he grew silent and thoughtful, as he sat there by Sylvia's side, looking out through the glazed gallery outside upon the spring foliage along the Embankment, the opaline river, and the shot towers and buildings on the opposite bank glowing warm brown against an evening sky of silvery blue. Not for the first time did it seem strange, incredible almost, to him that all these people should be so utterly without any recollection of events which surely might have been expected to leave some trace upon the least retentive memory--and yet it only proved once more how thoroughly and honourably the old Jinnee, now slumbering placidly in his bottle deep down in unfathomable mud, opposite the very spot where they were dining, had fulfilled his last undertaking. Fakrash, the brass bottle, and all the fantastic and embarrassing performances were indeed as totally forgotten as though they had never been. And it is but too probable that even this modest and veracious account of them will prove to have been included in the general act of oblivion--though the author will trust as long as possible that Fakrash-el-Aamash may have neglected to provide for this particular case, and that the history of the Brass Bottle may thus be permitted to linger awhile in the memories of some at least of its readers.
