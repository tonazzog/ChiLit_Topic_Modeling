"CHAPTER 7. AT SAINT CLOUD. One of his wishes was, to a certain degree, gratified at length.  He got a little more hunting when June came.  To the surprise of the court, and many besides, the royal family were quietly permitted to go to their country-house at Saint Cloud, a few miles from Paris, when the weather became too warm for a comfortable residence at the Tuileries.  The National Guard followed them; but the king rode out daily, attended only by an officer of General Lafayette's staff.  The queen was guarded by another of these officers, and the Dauphin by a third. It seems rather strange that so much liberty should have been allowed, when so lately every precaution was taken to prevent the flight of the family.  During the past winter and spring, and the next season, the leaders of the revolution kept a constant watch upon the palace, and knew all that went on there.  They knew what persons were admitted at back doors to consult with the queen.  They also knew, after the family returned from Saint Cloud, how many horses were in the royal stables, and how many of them stood constantly saddled and bridled.  They knew how the royal carriages were kept stuffed with luggage, ready to start at a moment's warning,--the royal arms being nearly rubbed out from the panels.  They declared also that they knew that the king's old aunts meant to go away, carrying off, not only plenty of treasure, but little Louis; and that a boy, very like Louis, had been in training for some time, to represent him, when the true Dauphin should have been carried to his uncle, over the frontiers.  All this was published in the newspapers, so that, if the old princesses had any such plan prepared, they were obliged to give it up.  Thus were the family guarded in Paris, before and after, and yet, in June, they were riding and driving about Saint Cloud, believing that they might go off any day they chose. Perhaps, however, this might not have proved so easy as they thought. There might have been spies about them that they did not know of; and, since nothing could be worse than their management of all business matters, from inexperience and want of knowledge of other people's minds and affairs, their enemies might feel pretty secure that the royal prisoners could not fly far without being caught. There was a plan for escape completely formed, as we know from the lady to whom the queen confided it.  No one doubted of the entire success of this scheme; and the lady daily expected and hoped to have to wait in vain for the return of the royal family from their drive. They went out every afternoon at four o'clock; and often did not return till eight, and sometimes even not till nine.  The king went on horseback, attended by grooms and pages on whom he could rely.  The ladies, in a carriage, were also followed by grooms and pages.  The plan was for all to ride to the same place on a certain afternoon, by different roads,--the king on horseback, the queen and her daughter, and the princess Elizabeth, in a carriage; the Dauphin and Madame de Tourzel in a chaise; and some of the royal suite in other vehicles.  On meeting in a wood, twelve miles from Saint Cloud, the three officers of Lafayette's staff were to be gained over, or to be overpowered by the servants; and then all were to push on for the frontier.  Meanwhile, the people at home would wait till nine o'clock, quietly enough.  Then, on becoming alarmed and looking about, they would find on the king's desk a letter to the Assembly, which they would instantly forward.  It could not reach Paris before ten; and then the Assembly would not be sitting. The president would have to be found; and the Assembly could hardly be got together, or messengers sent after the fugitives, before midnight; when the royal family would have had a start of eight hours. The lady to whom the queen confided this scheme approved it, but asked no questions, and hoped she should not be told the precise day, as she was to be left behind, and wished to be able to say that she had not known that they intended more than an afternoon drive when they went forth.  One June evening, nine o'clock came, and none of them were home. The attendants walked restlessly about the courts, and wondered.  The lady's heart beat so that she was afraid her emotion would be observed. But presently she heard the carriage-wheels; and all returned as usual. She told the queen that she had not expected to see her home to-night: and the queen replied that they must wait till the king's aunts had left France, and till they knew whether the plan would suit the wishes of their friends over the frontier. It was believed by many persons, and certainly by Lafayette, that there were plots, at this time, against the life of the queen.  An agent of the police gave notice of an intention to poison her.  The queen did not believe it.  She believed that her enemies meant to break her spirit by calumny; but she had no fear of poison.  Her head physician, however, chose to take precautions.  He desired one of her ladies to have always at hand a bottle of fresh, good oil of sweet almonds, which, with milk, is an antidote against corrosive poisons.  He was uneasy at the queen's habit of sweetening draughts of water from a sugar-basin which stood open in her apartment.  He was afraid of this sugar being poisoned.  The lady therefore kept a great quantity of sugar pounded in her own apartment, and always carried some packets of it in her bag, from which she changed the sugar in the basin, several times a day.  The queen found this out, and begged she would not take the trouble to do this, as she had no fear of dying by that method.  Poor lady!  She said sometimes that, but for her family's sake, she should be glad to die by any means. She was indeed unhappy; but she had not yet learned how much more unhappy had been multitudes of her people before they hated her as they now did.  She grieved to see her daughter growing up grave and silent, and her little boy of five years old surrounded by sorrowful faces, and subject to terrors at an age when he should have been merry, and smiled upon by everybody near him: but she knew nothing of the affliction of thousands of mothers who had seen their children dying of hunger on heaps of straw, in hovels open to the rain; or of the indignation of thousands more who had seen their lively, promising infants growing stupid and cross under the pressure of early toil, and in the absence of all instruction.  All this had happened while she was paying 15,000 pounds for a pair of diamond ear-rings, and using her influence in behalf of bad advisers to the king.  She might wish to die under her sorrows; she little knew how many had died under their most intolerable sufferings.
