"CHAPTER 49. TWO CONFESSIONS. Hester dragged her startled and rather unwilling companion in through the front entrance, past some agitated-looking servants who stood about in the hall, and through the velvet curtains into Mrs Willis's boudoir. The Misses Bruce were there, and Mrs Willis in her bonnet and cloak was hastily packing some things into a basket. ""I--I must speak to you,"" said Hester, going up to her governess. ""Susan and I have got something to say, and we must say it here, now at once?"" ""No, not now, Hester,"" replied Mrs Willis, looking for a moment into her pupil's agitated face.  ""Whatever you and Susan Drummond have to tell cannot be listened to by me at this moment.  I have not an instant to lose."" ""You are going to Annie?"" asked Hester. ""Yes; don't keep me.  Good-bye, my dears; good-bye."" Mrs Willis moved toward the door.  Hester, who felt almost beside herself, rushed after her, and caught her arm. ""Take us with you, take Susy and me with you--we must we must see Annie before she dies."" ""Hush, my child,"" said Mrs Willis very quietly; ""try to calm yourself. Whatever you have got to say shall be listened to later on--now moments are precious, and I cannot attend to you.  Calm yourself, Hester, and thank God for your dear little sister's safety.  Prepare yourself to receive her, for the carriage which takes me to Annie will bring little Nan home."" Mrs Willis left the room, and Hester threw herself on hen knees and covered her face with her trembling hands.  Presently she was aroused by a light touch on her arm; it was Susan Drummond. ""I may go now, I suppose, Hester?  You are not quite determined to make a fool of me, are you?"" ""I have determined to expose you, you coward, you mean, mean girl!"" answered Hester, springing to her feet.  ""Come, I have no idea of letting you go.  Mrs Willis won't listen--we will find Mr Everard."" Whether Susan would really have gone with Hester remains to be proved, but just at that moment all possibility of retreat was cut away from her by Miss Agnes Bruce, who quietly entered Mrs Willis's private sitting-room, followed by the very man Hester was about to seek. ""I thought it best, my dear,"" she said, turning apologetically to Hester, ""to go at once for our good clergyman; you can tell him all that is in your heart, and I will leave you.  Before I go, however.  I should like to tell you how I found Annie and little Nan."" Hester made no answer; just for a brief moment she raised her eyes to Miss Agnes's kind face, then they sought the floor. ""The story can be told in a few words, dear,"" said the little lady.  ""A work-woman of the name of Williams, whom my sister and I have employed for years, and who lives near Oakley, called on us this morning to apologise for not being able to finish some needlework.  She told us that she had a sick child, and also a little girl of three, in her house.  She said she had found the child, in ragged gipsy garments, fainting in a field.  She took her into her house, and, on undressing her, found that she was no true gipsy, but that her face and hands and arms had been dyed; she said the little one had been treated in a similar manner.  Jane's suspicions and mine were instantly roused, and we went back with the woman to Oakley, and round, as we had anticipated, that the children were little Nan and Annie.  The sad thing is that Annie is in high fever, and knows no one.  We waited there until the doctor arrived, who spoke very, very seriously of her case.  Little Nan is well, and asked for you."" With these last words Miss Agnes Bruce softly left the room, closing the door after her. ""Now, Susan,"" said Hester, without an instant's pause; ""come, let us tell Mr Everard of our wickedness.  Oh, sir,"" she added, raising her eyes to the clergyman's face, ""if Annie dies I shall go mad.  Oh, I cannot, cannot bear life if Annie dies!"" ""Tell me what is wrong, my poor child,"" said Mr Everard.  He laid his hand on her shoulder, and gradually and skillfully drew from the agitated and miserable girl the story of her sin, of her cowardice, and of her deep, though until now unavailing repentance.  How from the first she had hated and disliked Annie; how unjustly she had felt toward her; how she had longed and hoped Annie was guilty; and how, when at last the clew was put into her hands to prove Annie's absolute innocence, she had determined not to use it. ""From the day Nan was lost,"" continued Hester, ""it has been all agony and all repentance; but, oh, I was too proud to tell!  I was too proud to humble myself to the very dust!"" ""But not now,"" said the clergyman very gently. ""No, no; not now.  I care for nothing now in all the world except that Annie may live."" ""You don't mind the fact that Mrs Willis and all your school-fellows must know of this, and must--must judge you accordingly?"" ""They can't think worse of me than I think of myself.  I only want Annie to live."" ""No, Hester,"" answered Mr Everard, ""you want more than that--you want far more than that.  It may be that God will take Annie Forest away.  We cannot tell.  With Him alone are the issues of life or death.  What you really want, my child, is the forgiveness of the little girl you have wronged, and the forgiveness of your Father in heaven.""  Hester began to sob wildly. ""If--if she dies--may I see her first?"" she gasped. ""Yes; I will try and promise you that.  Now, will you go to your room? I must speak to Miss Drummond alone; she is a far worse culprit than you."" Mr Everard opened the door for Hester, who went silently out. ""Meet me in the chapel to-night,"" he whispered low in her car, ""I will talk with you and pray with you there."" He closed the door, and came back to Susan. All throughout this interview his manner had been very gentle to Hester; but the clergyman could be stern, and there was a gleam of very righteous anger in his eyes as he turned to the sullen girl who leaned heavily against the table. ""This narrative of Hester Thornton's is, of course, quite true, Miss Drummond?"" ""Oh, yes; there seems to be no use in denying that,"" said Susan. ""I must insist on your telling me the exact story of your sin.  There is no use in your attempting to deny anything; only the utmost candour on your part can now save you from being publicly expelled."" ""I am willing to tell,"" answered Susan.  ""I meant no harm; it was done as a bit of fun.  I had a cousin at home who was very clever at drawing caricatures, and I happened to have nothing to do one day, and I was alone in Annie's bedroom, and I thought I'd like to see what she kept in her desk.  I always had a fancy for collecting odd keys, and I found one on my bunch which fitted her desk exactly.  I opened it, and I found such a smart little caricature of Mrs Willis.  I sent the caricature to my cousin, and begged of her to make an exact copy of it.  She did so, and I put Annie's back in her desk, and pasted the other into Cecil's book.  I didn't like Dora Russell, and I wrapped up the sweeties in her theme; but I did the other for pure fun, for I knew Cecil would be so shocked; but I never guessed the blame would fall on Annie.  When I found it did, I felt inclined to tell once or twice, but it seemed too much trouble, and, besides, I knew Mrs Willis would punish me, and, of course, I didn't wish that. ""Dora Russell was always very nasty to me, and when I found she was putting on such airs, and pretending she could write such a grand essay for the prize, I thought I'd take down her pride a bit.  I went to her desk, and I got some of the rough copy of the thing she was calling `The River,' and I sent it off to my cousin, and my cousin made up such a ridiculous paper, and she hit off Dora's writing to the life, and, of course, I had to put it into Dora's desk and tear up her real copy.  It was very unlucky Hester being in the room.  Of course I never guessed that, or I wouldn't have gone.  That was the night we all went with Annie to the fairies' field.  I never meant to get Hester into a scrape, nor Annie either, for that matter; but, of course, I couldn't be expected to tell on myself.""
