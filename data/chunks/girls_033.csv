"CHAPTER 33. UNTRUSTWORTHY. Dora Russell had declared, in Hester's presence, and with intense energy in her manner, that the author of the insult to which she had been exposed should be publicly punished, and, if possible, expelled.  On the evening of her interview with the head teacher, she had so far forgotten herself as to reiterate this desire with extreme vehemence.  She had boldly declared her firm conviction of Annie's guilt, and had broadly hinted at Mrs Willis's favouritism toward her.  The great dignity, however, of her teacher's manner, and the half-sorrowful, half-indignant look she bestowed on the excited girl, calmed her down after a time. Mrs Willis felt full sympathy for Dora, and could well understand how trying and aggravating this practical joke must be to so proud a girl; but although her faith was undoubtedly shaken in Annie, she would not allow this sentiment to appear. ""I will do all I can for you, Dora,"" she said, when the weeping Annie had left the room; ""I will do everything in my power to find out who has injured you.  Annie has absolutely denied the accusation you bring against her, and unless her guilt can be proved it is but right to believe her innocent.  There are many other girls in Lavender House; and to-morrow morning I will sift this unpleasant affair to the very bottom. Go, now, my dear, and if you have sufficient self-command and self-control, try to have courage to write your essay over again.  I have no doubt that your second rendering of your subject will be more attractive than the first.  Beginners cannot too often re-write their themes."" Dora gave her head a proud little toss, but she was sufficiently in awe of Mrs Willis to keep back any retort, and she went out of the room feeling unsatisfied and wretched, and inclined for a sympathising chat with her little friend, Hester Thornton. Hester, however, when she reached her, seemed not at all disposed to talk to anyone. ""I've had it all out with Mrs Willis, and there is no doubt she will be exposed to-morrow morning,"" said Dora, half aloud. Hester, whose head was bent over her French history, looked up with an annoyed expression. ""Who will be exposed?"" she asked, in a petulant voice. ""Oh, how stupid you are growing, Hester Thornton!"" exclaimed Dora; ""why, that horrid Annie Forest, of course--but really I have no patience to talk to you; you have lost all your spirit.  I was very foolish to demean myself by taking so much notice of one of the little girls."" Dora sailed down the play-room to her own drawing-room, fully expecting Hester to rise and rush after her; but to her surprise Hester did not stir, but sat with her head bent over her book, and her cheeks slightly flushed. The next morning Mrs Willis kept her word to Dora, and made the very strictest inquiries with regard to the practical joke to which Dora had been subjected.  She first of all fully explained what had taken place in the presence of the whole school, and then each girl was called up in rotation, and asked two questions: first, had she done this mischievous thing herself? second, could she throw any light on the subject? One by one each girl appeared before her teacher, replied in the negative to both queries, and returned to her seat. ""Now, girls,"" said Mrs Willis, ""you have each of you denied this charge.  Such a thing as has happened to Dora could not have been done without hands.  The teachers in the school are above suspicion; the servants are none of them clever enough to perform this base trick.  I suspect one of you, and I am quite determined to get at the truth. During the whole of this half-year there has been a spirit of unhappiness, of mischief, and of suspicion in our midst.  Under these circumstances love cannot thrive; under these circumstances the true and ennobling sense of brotherly kindness, and all those feelings which real religion prompt must languish.  I tell you all now plainly that I will not have this thing in Lavender House.  It is simply disgraceful for one girl to play such tricks on her fellows.  This is not the first time nor the second time that the school-desks have been tampered with.  I will find out--I am determined to find out, who this dishonest person is; and as she has not chosen to confess to me, as she has preferred falsehood to truth, I will visit her, when I do discover her, with my very gravest displeasure.  In this school I have always endeavoured to inculcate the true principles of honour and of trust.  I have laid down certain broad rules, and expect them to be obeyed; but I have never hampered you with petty and humiliating restraints.  I have given you a certain freedom, which I believed to be for your best good, and I have never suspected one of you until you have given me due cause. ""Now, however, I tell you plainly that I alter all my tactics.  One girl sitting in this room is guilty.  For her sake I shall treat you all as guilty, and punish you accordingly.  For the remainder of this term, or until the hour when the guilty girl chooses to release her companions, you are all, with the exception of the little children and Miss Russell, who can scarcely have played this trick on herself, under punishment.  I withdraw your half-holidays--I take from you the use of the South Parlour for your acting, and every drawing-room in the play-room is confiscated.  But this, is not all that I do.  In taking from you my trust, I must treat you as untrustworthy--you will no longer enjoy the liberty you used to delight in--everywhere you will be watched.  A teacher will sit in your play-room with you, a teacher will accompany you into the grounds, and I tell you plainly, girls, that chance words and phrases which drop from your lips shall be taken up, and used, if necessary, to the elucidation of this disgraceful mystery."" Here Mrs Willis left the room, and the teachers desired the several girls in their classes to attend to their morning studies. Nothing could exceed the dismay which her words had produced.  The innocent girls were fairly stunned, and from that hour for many a day all sunshine and happiness seemed really to have left Lavender House. The two, however, who felt the change most acutely, and on whose altered faces their companions began to fix suspicious eyes, were Annie Forest and Hester Thornton.  Hester was burdened with an intolerable sense of the shameful falsehood she had told; Annie, guilty in another matter, succumbed at last utterly to a sense of misery and injustice.  Her orphaned and lonely position for the first time began to tell on her; she ate little and slept little, her face grew very pale and thin, and her health really suffered.
