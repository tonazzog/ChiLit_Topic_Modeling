"CHAPTER XIII. Little Meg's Father The baby was buried the next morning, after Meg had looked upon it for the last time lying very peacefully and smilingly in its little coffin, and had shed some tears that were full of sorrow yet had no bitterness upon its dead face.  Mrs Blossom took Robin to follow it to the grave, leaving Kitty in charge of little Meg.  The front attic door was locked, and the key was under Meg's pillow, not to be used again until she was well enough to turn it herself in the lock.  The bag containing the small key of the box, with the unopened letter which had come for her mother, hung always round her neck, and her hand often clasped it tightly as she slept. Meg was lying very still, with her face turned from the light, following in her thoughts the little coffin that was being carried in turns by Mrs Blossom and another woman whom she knew, through the noisy streets, when Kitty heard the tread of a man's foot coming up the ladder.  It could be no one else but Dr Christie, she thought; but why then did he stop at the front attic door, and rattle the latch in trying to open it?  Kitty looked out and saw a seafaring man, in worn and shabby sailor's clothing, as if he had just come off a long voyage. His face was brown and weather-beaten; and his eyes, black and bright, were set deep in his head, and looked as if they were used to take long, keen surveys over the glittering sea.  He turned sharply round as Kitty opened her door. 'Young woman,' he said, 'do you know aught of my wife, Peggy Fleming, and her children, who used to live here?  Peggy wrote me word she'd moved into the front attic.' 'It's father,' called little Meg from her mattress on the floor; 'I'm here, father!  Robin and me's left; but mother's dead, and baby.  Oh! father, father!  You've come home at last!' Meg's father brushed past Kitty into the room where Meg sat up in bed, her face quivering, and her poor bruised arms stretched out to welcome him.  He sat down on the mattress and took her in his own strong arms, while for a minute or two Meg lay still in them, almost like one dead. 'Oh!' she said at last, with a sigh as if her heart had well-nigh broken, 'I've took care of Robin and the money, and they're safe.  Only baby's dead.  But don't you mind much, father; it wasn't a nice place for baby to grow up in.' 'Tell me all about it,' said Robert Fleming, looking at Kitty, but still holding his little daughter in his arms; and Kitty told him all she knew of her lonely life and troubles up in the solitary attic, which no one had been allowed to enter; and from time to time Meg's father groaned aloud, and kissed Meg's pale and wrinkled forehead fondly.  But he asked how it was she never let any of the neighbours, Kitty herself, for instance, stay with her, and help her sometimes. 'I promised mother,' whispered Meg in his ear, 'never to let nobody come in, for fear they'd find out the box under the bed, and get into it somehow.  We was afraid for the money, you know, but it's all safe for your mate, father; and here's the key, and a letter as came for mother after she was dead.' 'But this letter's from me to Peggy,' said her father, turning it over and over; 'leastways it was wrote by the chaplain at the hospital, to tell her what she must do.  The money in the box was mine, Meg, no mate's; and I sent her word to take some of it for herself and the children.' 'Mother thought it belonged to a mate of yours,' said Meg, 'and we was the more afeared of it being stole.' 'It's my fault,' replied Robert Fleming.  'I told that to mother for fear she'd waste it if she knew it were mine.  But if I'd only known----' He could not finish his sentence, but stroked Meg's hair with his large hand, and she felt some hot tears fall from his eyes upon her forehead. 'Don't cry, father,' she said, lifting her small feeble hand to his face.  'God took care of us, and baby too, though she's dead.  There's nothink now that He hasn't done.  He's done everythink I asked Him.' 'Did you ask Him to make me a good father?' said Fleming. 'Why, you're always good to us, father,' answered Meg, in a tone of loving surprise.  'You never beat us much when you get drunk.  But Robin and me always say, ""Pray God, bless father.""  I don't quite know what bless means, but it's something good.' 'Ah!' said Fleming, with a deep sigh, 'He has blessed me.  When I was ill He showed me what a poor sinner I was, and how Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, ""of whom I am chief.""  Sure I can say that if anybody can.  But it says in the Bible, ""He loved me, and gave Himself for me.""  Yes, little Meg, He died to save me.  I felt it.  I believed it.  I came to see that I'd nobody to fly to but Jesus if I wanted to be aught else but a poor, wicked, lost rascal, as got drunk, and was no better than a brute.  And so I turned it over and over in my mind, lying abed; and now, please God, I'm a bit more like being a Christian than I was.  I reckon that's what bless means, little Meg.' As he spoke the door opened, and Mrs Blossom came in with Robin.  It was twelve months since Robin had seen his father, and now he was shy, and hung back a little behind Mrs Blossom; but Meg called to him in a joyful voice. 'Come here, little Robbie,' she said; 'it's father, as we've watched for so long.--He's a little bit afeared at first, father, but you'll love him ever so when he knows you.' It was not long before Robin knew his father sufficiently to accept of a seat on his knee, when Meg was put back into bed at Mrs Blossom's entreaties.  Fleming nursed his boy in silence for some time, while now and then a tear glistened in his deep eyes as he thought over the history of little Meg's sorrows. 'I'm thinking,' said Mrs Blossom cheerfully, 'as this isn't the sort o' place for a widow man and his children to stop in.  I'm just frightened to death o' going up and down the court.  I suppose you're not thinking o' settling here, Mr Fleming?' 'No, no,' said Fleming, shaking his head: 'a decent man couldn't stop here, let alone a Christian.' 'Well, then, come home to us till you can turn yourself round,' continued Mrs Blossom heartily; 'me and Mr George have talked it over, and he says, ""When little Meg's father do come, let 'em all come here: Posy, and the little 'uns, and all.  You'll have Posy and the little 'uns in your room, and I'll have him in mine.  We'll give him some sort o' a shakedown, and sailors don't use to lie soft."" So if you've no objections to raise, it's settled; and if you have, please to raise 'em at once.' Robert Fleming had no objections to raise, but he accepted the cordial invitation thankfully, for he was in haste to get out of the miserable life of Angel Court.  He brought the hidden box into the back attic, and opened it before little Meg, taking out of it the packet of forty pounds, and a number of pawn-tickets, which he looked at very sorrowfully.  After securing these he locked up the attic again, and carrying Meg in his arms, he led the way down the stairs, and through the court, followed closely by Mrs Blossom, Posy, and Robin.  The sound of brawling and quarrelling was loud as usual, and the children crawling about the pavement were dirty and squalid as ever; they gathered about Meg and her father, forming themselves into a dirty and ragged procession to accompany them down to the street.  Little Meg looked up to the high window of the attic, where she had watched so often and so long for her father's coming; and then she looked round, with eyes full of pity, upon the wretched group about her; and closing her eyelids, her lips moving a little, but without any words which even her father could hear, she said in her heart, 'Pray God, bless everybody, and make them good.'
