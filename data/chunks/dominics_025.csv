"CHAPTER 24. THE RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION. The adventures of the morning did not certainly tend to make the Fifth think better of Oliver Greenfield. Had he appeared before them humble and penitent, there were some who even then might have tried to forgive him and forget what was done.  But instead of that he was evidently determined to brazen the thing out, and had begun by snubbing the very fellows whom he had so deeply injured. Wraysford felt specially hurt.  It had cost him a good deal to put on a friendly air and speak as if nothing had happened; and to find himself scorned for his pains and actually avoided by the friend who had wronged him was too much.  But even that would not have been so bad, had not Oliver immediately gone and made up to Simon before all the class. Wraysford did not remain to join in the chorus of indignation in which the others indulged after morning school was over.  He left them and strolled out dismally into the playground. He must do something!  He must know one way or the other what to think of Oliver.  Even now he would gladly believe that it was all a dream, and that nothing had come between him and his old friend.  But the more he pondered it the more convinced he became it was anything but a dream. He wandered unconsciously beyond the playground towards the woods on the side of the Shar, where he and Oliver had walked so often in the old days. The old days!  It was but yesterday that they had last walked there. Yet what an age ago it seemed! and how impossible that the old days should ever come back again. He had not got far into the wood when he heard what seemed to him familiar footsteps ahead of him.  Yesterday he would have shouted and whistled and called on the fellow to hold hard.  But now he had no such inclination.  His impulse was to turn round and go back. ""And yet,"" thought he, ""why should _I go_ back?  If it is Oliver, what have _I_ to feel ashamed of?"" And so he advanced.  The boy in front of him was walking slowly, and Wraysford soon came in view of him.  As he expected, it was Oliver. At the sight of his old friend, wandering here solitary and listless, all Wraysford's old affection came suddenly back.  At least he would make one more effort.  So he quickened his pace.  Oliver turned and saw him coming.  But he did not wait.  He walked on slowly as before, apparently indifferent to the approach of anybody. This was a damper certainly to Wraysford.  At least Oliver might have guessed why his friend was coming after him. It was desperately hard to know how to begin a conversation.  Oliver trudged on, sullen and silent, in anything but an encouraging manner. Still, Wraysford, now his mind was made up, was not to be put from his purpose. ""Noll, old man,"" he began, in as much of his old tone and manner as he could assume. ""Well?"" said Oliver, not looking up. ""Aren't we to be friends still?"" The question cost the speaker a hard effort, and evidently went home. Oliver stopped short in his walk, and looking full in his old friend's face, said, ""Why do you ask?"" ""Because I'm afraid we are not friends at this moment."" ""And whose fault is that?"" said Oliver, scornfully. The question stung Wraysford as much as it amazed him.  Was he, then, of all the fellows in the school, to have an explanation thus demanded of him from one who had done him the most grievous personal wrong one schoolboy well could do to another? His face flushed as he replied slowly, ""Your fault, Greenfield; how can you ask?"" Oliver gave a short laugh very like contempt, and then turned suddenly on his heel, leaving Wraysford smarting with indignation, and finally convinced that between his old friend and himself there was a gulf which now it would be hard indeed to bridge over. He returned moodily to the school.  Stephen was busy in his study getting tea. ""Hullo, Wray,"" he shouted, as the elder boy entered; ""don't you wish it was this time to-morrow?  I do, I'm mad to hear the result!"" ""Are you?"" said Wraysford. ""Yes, and so are you, you old humbug.  Noll says he thinks he did pretty well, and that you answered well too.  I say, what a joke if it's a dead heat, and you both get bracketed first."" ""Cut away now,"" said Wraysford, as coolly as he could, ""and don't make such a row."" There was something unusual in his tone which surprised the small boy. He put it down, however, to worry about the examination, and quietly withdrew as commanded. The next day came at last.  Two days ago, in the Fifth Form, at any rate, it would have been uphill work for any master to attempt to conduct morning class in the face of all the eagerness and enthusiasm with which the result of the examinations would have been looked-for. Now, however, there was all the suspense, indeed, but it was the suspense of dread rather than triumph. ""Never mind,"" said Ricketts to Pembury, after the two had been talking over the affair for the twentieth time.  ""Never mind; and there's just this, Tony, if Wray is only second, it will be a splendid win for the Fifth all the same."" ""I see nothing splendid in the whole concern,"" said Pembury.  And that was the general feeling. Oliver entered and took his accustomed seat in silence.  No one spoke to him, many moved away from him, and nearly all favoured him with a long and unfriendly stare. All these things he took unmoved.  He sat coolly waiting for class to begin, and when it did begin, any one would have supposed he was the only comfortable and easy-minded fellow in the room.  The lesson dragged on languidly that morning.  Most of the boys seemed to regard it as something inflicted on them to pass the time rather than as a serious effort of instruction.  The clock crawled slowly on from ten to eleven, and from eleven to half-past, and every one was glad when at last Mr Jellicott closed his book.  Then followed an interval of suspense.  The Doctor was due with the results, and was even now announcing them in the Sixth.  What ages it seemed before his footsteps sounded in the passage outside the Fifth! At last he entered, and a hush fell over the class.  One or two glanced quickly up, as though they hoped to read their fate in the head master's face.  Others waited, too anxious to stir or look up.  Others groaned inwardly with a sort of prophetic foresight of what was to come. The Doctor walked up to the desk and unfolded his paper. Wraysford looked furtively across the room to where his old friend sat. There was a flush in Oliver's face as he followed the Doctor with his eyes; he was breathing hard, Wraysford could see, and the corners of his mouth were working with more than ordinary nervousness. ""Alas!"" thought Wraysford, ""I don't envy him his thoughts!"" The Doctor began to speak. ""The following are the results of the various examinations held on Monday.  English Literature--maximum number of marks 100. 1st, Bullinger, 72 marks; 2nd, West, 68; 3rd, Maybury, 51; 4th, Simon, 23. I'm afraid, Simon, you were a little too venturesome entering for an examination like this.  Your paper was a very poor performance."" Simon groaned and gulped down his astonishment. ""I say,"" whispered he to Oliver, who sat in front of him, ""I know it's a mistake: you know I wrote five cantos about the Shar--good too.  He's lost that.  I say, had I better tell him?"" Oliver vouchsafing no reply, the unfortunate poet merely replied to the head master's remarks, ""Yes, sir,"" and then subsided, more convinced than ever that Saint Dominic's was not worthy of him.
