"CHAPTER VIII. PASSING THE OUBLIETTE  WHO can describe the dreariness of being snowed-up all the winter with such a mother-in-law as Freiherrinn Kunigunde? Yet it was well that the snow came early, for it was the best defence of the lonely castle from any attack on the part of the Schlangenwaldern, the Swabian League, or the next heir, Freiherr Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss.  The elder Baroness had, at least, the merit of a stout heart, and, even with her sadly-reduced garrison, feared none of them. She had been brought up in the faith that Adlerstein was impregnable, and so she still believed; and, if the disaster that had cut off her husband and son was to happen at all, she was glad that it had befallen before the homage had been paid.  Probably the Schlangenwald Count knew how tough a morsel the castle was like to prove, and Wildschloss was serving at a distance, for nothing was heard of either during the short interval while the roads were still open.  During this time an attempt had been made through Father Norbert to ascertain what had become of the corpses of the two Barons and their followers, and it had appeared that the Count had carried them all off from the inn, no doubt to adorn his castle with their limbs, or to present them to the Emperor in evidence of his zeal for order.  The old Baron could not indeed have been buried in consecrated ground, nor have masses said for him; but for the weal of her son’s soul Dame Kunigunde gave some of her few ornaments, and Christina added her gold earrings, and all her scanty purse, that both her husband and father might be joined in the prayers of the Church—trying with all her might to put confidence in Hugh Sorel’s Loretto relic, and the Indulgence he had bought, and trusting with more consolatory thoughts to the ever stronger dawnings of good she had watched in her own Eberhard. She had some consoling intercourse with the priest while all this was pending; but throughout the winter she was entirely cut off from every creature save the inmates of the castle, where, as far as the old lady was concerned, she only existed on sufferance, and all her meekness and gentleness could not win for her more than the barest toleration. That Eberhard had for a few hours survived his father, and that thus the Freiherrinn Christina was as much the Dowager Baroness as Kunigunde herself, was often insisted on in the kitchen by Ursel, Hatto, and the Schneiderlein, whom Christina had unconsciously rendered her most devoted servant, not only by her daily care of his wound, but by her kind courteous words, and by her giving him his proper name of Heinz, dropping the absurd _nom de guerre_ of the Schneiderlein, or little tailor, which had been originally conferred on him in allusion to the valiant Tailorling who boasted of having killed seven flies at a blow, and had been carried on chiefly because of the contradiction between such a title and his huge brawny strength and fierce courage.  Poor Eberhard, with his undaunted bravery and free reckless good-nature, a ruffian far more by education than by nature, had been much loved by his followers.  His widow would have reaped the benefit of that affection even if her exceeding sweetness had not gained it on her own account; and this giant was completely gained over to her, when, amid all her sorrow and feebleness, she never failed to minister to his sufferings to the utmost, while her questions about his original home, and revival of the name of his childhood, softened him, and awoke in him better feelings.  He would have died to serve her, and she might have headed an opposition party in the castle, had she not been quite indifferent to all save her grief; and, except by sitting above the salt at the empty table, she laid no claim to any honours or authority, and was more seldom than ever seen beyond what was now called her own room. At last, when for the second time she was seeing the snow wreaths dwindle, and the drops shine forth in moisture again, while the mountain paths were set free by the might of the springtide sun, she spoke almost for the first time with authority, as she desired Heinz to saddle her mule, and escort her to join in the Easter mass at the Blessed Friedmund’s Chapel.  Ursel heaped up objections; but so urgent was Christina for confession and for mass, that the old woman had not the heart to stop her by a warning to the elder Baroness, and took the alternative of accompanying her.  It was a glorious sparkling Easter Day, lovely blue sky above, herbage and flowers glistening below, snow dazzling in the hollows, peasants assembling in holiday garb, and all rejoicing.  Even the lonely widow, in her heavy veil and black mufflings, took hope back to her heart, and smiled when at the church door a little child came timidly up to her with a madder-tinted Easter egg—a gift once again like the happy home customs of Ulm.  She gave the child a kiss—she had nothing else to give, but the sweet face sent it away strangely glad. The festival mass in all its exultation was not fully over, when anxious faces began to be seen at the door, and whisperings went round and many passed out.  Nobody at Adlerstein was particular about silence in church, and, when the service was not in progress, voices were not even lowered, and, after many attempts on the part of the Schneiderlein to attract the attention of his mistress, his voice immediately succeeded the _Ite missa est_, “Gracious lady, we must begone.  Your mule is ready.  There is a party at the Debateable Ford, whether Schlangenwald or Wildschloss we know not yet, but either way you must be the first thing placed in safety.” Christina turned deadly pale.  She had long been ready to welcome death as a peaceful friend; but, sheltered as her girlhood had been in the quiet city, she had never been brought in contact with warfare, and her nervous, timid temperament made the thought most appalling and frightful to her, certain as she was that the old Baroness would resist to the uttermost.  Father Norbert saw her extreme terror, and, with the thought that he might comfort and support her, perhaps mediate between the contending parties, plead that it was holy-tide, and proclaim the peace of the church, or at the worst protect the lady herself, he offered his company; but, though she thanked him, it was as if she scarcely understood his kindness, and a shudder passed over her whenever the serfs, hastily summoned to augment the garrison, came hurrying down the path, or turned aside into the more rugged and shorter descents.  It was strange, the good father thought, that so timorous and fragile a being should have her lot cast amid these rugged places and scenes of violence, with no one to give her the care and cherishing she so much required.

"Even when she crept up the castle stairs, she was met with an angry rebuke, not so much for the peril she had incurred as for having taken away the Schneiderlein, by far the most availing among the scanty remnant of the retainers of Adlerstein.  Attempting no answer, and not even daring to ask from what quarter came the alarm, Christina made her way out of the turmoil to that chamber of her own, the scene of so much fear and sorrow, and yet of some share of peace and happiness.  But from the window, near the fast subsiding waters of the Debateable Ford, could plainly be seen the small troop of warriors, of whom Jobst the Kohler had brought immediate intelligence.  The sun glistened on their armour, and a banner floated gaily on the wind; but they were a fearful sight to the inmates of the lonely castle. A stout heart was however Kunigunde’s best endowment; and, with the steadiness and precision of a general, her commands rang out, as she arranged and armed her garrison, perfectly resolved against any submission, and confident in the strength of her castle; nay, not without a hope of revenge either against Schlangenwald or Wildschloss, whom, as a degenerate Adlerstein, she hated only less than the slayer of her husband and son. The afternoon of Easter Day however passed away without any movement on the part of the enemy, and it was not till the following day that they could be seen struggling through the ford, and preparing to ascend the mountain.  Attacks had sometimes been disconcerted by posting men in the most dangerous passes; but, in the lack of numbers, and of trustworthy commanders, the Freiherrinn had judged it wiser to trust entirely to her walls, and keep her whole force within them. The new comers could hardly have had any hostile intentions, for, though well armed and accoutred, their numbers did not exceed twenty-five.  The banner borne at their head was an azure one, with a white eagle, and their leader could be observed looking with amazement at the top of the watch-tower, where the same eagle had that morning been hoisted for the first time since the fall of the two Freiherren. So soon as the ascent had been made, the leader wound his horn, and, before the echoes had died away among the hills, Hatto, acting as seneschal, was demanding his purpose. “I am Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss,” was the reply.  “I have hitherto been hindered by stress of weather from coming to take possession of my inheritance.  Admit me, that I may arrange with the widowed Frau Freiherrinn as to her dower and residence.” “The widowed Frau Freiherrinn, born of Adlerstein,” returned Hatto, “thanks the Freiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss; but she holds the castle as guardian to the present head of the family, the Freiherr von Adlerstein.” “It is false, old man,” exclaimed the Wildschloss; “the Freiherr had no other son.” “No,” said Hatto, “but Freiherr Eberhard hath left us twin heirs, our young lords, for whom we hold this castle.” “This trifling will not serve!” sternly spoke the knight.  “Eberhard von Adlerstein died unmarried.” “Not so,” returned Hatto, “our gracious Frau Freiherrinn, the younger, was wedded to him at the last Friedmund Wake, by the special blessing of our good patron, who would not see our house extinct.” “I must see thy lady, old man,” said Sir Kasimir, impatiently, not in the least crediting the story, and believing his cousin Kunigunde quite capable of any measure that could preserve to her the rule in Schloss Adlerstein, even to erecting some passing love affair of her son’s into a marriage.  And he hardly did her injustice, for she had never made any inquiry beyond the castle into the validity of Christina’s espousals, nor sought after the friar who had performed the ceremony.  She consented to an interview with the claimant of the inheritance, and descended to the gateway for the purpose.  The court was at its cleanest, the thawing snow having newly washed away its impurities, and her proud figure, under her black hood and veil, made an imposing appearance as she stood tall and defiant in the archway. Sir Kasimir was a handsome man of about thirty, of partly Polish descent, and endowed with Slavonic grace and courtesy, and he had likewise been employed in negotiations with Burgundy, and had acquired much polish and knowledge of the world. “Lady,” he said, “I regret to disturb and intrude on a mourning family, but I am much amazed at the tidings I have heard; and I must pray of you to confirm them.” “I thought they would confound you,” composedly replied Kunigunde. “And pardon me, lady, but the Diet is very nice in requiring full proofs. I would be glad to learn what lady was chosen by my deceased cousin Eberhard.” “The lady is Christina, daughter of his esquire, Hugh Sorel, of an honourable family at Ulm.” “Ha!  I know who and what Sorel was!” exclaimed Wildschloss.  “Lady cousin, thou wouldst not stain the shield of Adlerstein with owning aught that cannot bear the examination of the Diet!” “Sir Kasimir,” said Kunigunde proudly, “had I known the truth ere my son’s death, I had strangled the girl with mine own hands!  But I learnt it only by his dying confession; and, had she been a beggar’s child, she was his wedded wife, and her babes are his lawful heirs.” “Knowest thou time—place—witnesses?” inquired Sir Kasimir. “The time, the Friedmund Wake; the place, the Friedmund Chapel,” replied the Baroness.  “Come hither, Schneiderlein.  Tell the knight thy young lord’s confession.” He bore emphatic testimony to poor Eberhard’s last words; but as to the point of who had performed the ceremony, he knew not,—his mind had not retained the name. “I must see the Frau herself,” said Wildschloss, feeling certain that such a being as he expected in a daughter of the dissolute lanzknecht Sorel would soon, by dexterous questioning, be made to expose the futility of her pretensions so flagrantly that even Kunigunde could not attempt to maintain them. For one moment Kunigunde hesitated, but suddenly a look of malignant satisfaction crossed her face.  She spoke a few words to Squinting Mätz, and then replied that Sir Kasimir should be allowed to satisfy himself, but that she could admit no one else into the castle; hers was a widow’s household, the twins were only a few hours old, and she could not open her gates to admit any person besides himself. So resolved on judging for himself was Adlerstein Wildschloss that all this did not stagger him; for, even if he had believed more than he did of the old lady’s story, there would have been no sense of intrusion or impropriety in such a visit to the mother.  Indeed, had Christina been living in the civilized world, her chamber would have been hung with black cloth, black velvet would have enveloped her up to the eyes, and the blackest of cradles would have stood ready for her fatherless babe; two steps, in honour of her baronial rank, would have led to her bed, and a beaufet with the due baronial amount of gold and silver plate would have held the comfits and caudle to be dispensed to all visitors.  As it was, the two steps built into the floor of the room, and the black hood that Ursel tied over her young mistress’s head, were the only traces that such etiquette had ever been heard of.

"But when Baron Kasimir had clanked up the turret stairs, each step bringing to her many a memory of him who should have been there, and when he had been led to the bedside, he was completely taken by surprise. Instead of the great, flat-faced, coarse comeliness of a German wench, treated as a lady in order to deceive him, he saw a delicate, lily-like face, white as ivory, and the soft, sweet brown eyes under their drooping lashes, so full of innocence and sad though thankful content, that he felt as if the inquiries he came to make were almost sacrilege. He had seen enough of the world to know that no agent in a clumsy imposition would look like this pure white creature, with her arm encircling the two little swaddled babes, whose red faces and bald heads alone were allowed to appear above their mummy-like wrappings; and he could only make an obeisance lower and infinitely more respectful than that with which he had favoured the Baroness _née_ von Adlerstein, with a few words of inquiry and apology. But Christina had her sons’ rights to defend now, and she had far more spirit to do so than ever she had had in securing her own position, and a delicate rose tint came into her cheek as she said in her soft voice, “The Baroness tells me, that you, noble sir, would learn who wedded me to my dear and blessed lord, Sir Eberhard.  It was Friar Peter of the Franciscan brotherhood of Offingen, an agent for selling indulgences. Two of his lay brethren were present.  My dear lord gave his own name and mine in full after the holy rite; the friar promising his testimony if it were needed.  He is to be found, or at least heard of, at his own cloister; and the hermit at the chapel likewise beheld a part of the ceremony.” “Enough, enough, lady,” replied Sir Kasimir; “forgive me for having forced the question upon you.” “Nay,” replied Christina, with her blush deepening, “it is but just and due to us all;” and her soft eyes had a gleam of exultation, as she looked at the two little mummies that made up the _us_—“I would have all inquiries made in full.” “They shall be made, lady, as will be needful for the establishment of your son’s right as a free Baron of the empire, but not with any doubt on my part, or desire to controvert that right.  I am fully convinced, and only wish to serve you and my little cousins.  Which of them is the head of our family?” he added, looking at the two absolutely undistinguishable little chrysalises, so exactly alike that Christina herself was obliged to look for the black ribbon, on which a medal had been hung, round the neck of the elder.  Sir Kasimir put one knee to the ground as he kissed the red cheek of the infant and the white hand of the mother. “Lady cousin,” he said to Kunigunde, who had stood by all this time with an anxious, uneasy, scowling expression on her face, “I am satisfied.  I own this babe as the true Freiherr von Adlerstein, and far be it from me to trouble his heritage.  Rather point out the way in which I may serve you and him.  Shall I represent all to the Emperor, and obtain his wardship, so as to be able to protect you from any attacks by the enemies of the house?” “Thanks, sir,” returned the elder lady, severely, seeing Christina’s gratified, imploring face.  “The right line of Adlerstein can take care of itself without greedy guardians appointed by usurpers.  Our submission has never been made, and the Emperor cannot dispose of our wardship.” And Kunigunde looked defiant, regarding herself and her grandson as quite as good as the Emperor, and ready to blast her daughter-in-law with her eyes for murmuring gratefully and wistfully, “Thanks, noble sir, thanks!” “Let me at least win a friendly right in my young cousins,” said Sir Kasimir, the more drawn by pitying admiration towards their mother, as he perceived more of the grandmother’s haughty repulsiveness and want of comprehension of the dangers of her position.  “They are not baptized? Let me become their godfather.” Christina’s face was all joy and gratitude, and even the grandmother made no objection; in fact, it was the babes’ only chance of a noble sponsor; and Father Norbert, who had already been making ready for the baptism, was sent for from the hall.  Kunigunde, meantime, moved about restlessly, went half-way down the stairs, and held council with some one there; Ursel likewise, bustled about, and Sir Kasimir remained seated on the chair that had been placed for him near Christina’s bed. She was able again to thank him, and add, “It may be that you will have more cause than the lady grandmother thinks to remember your offer of protection to my poor orphans.  Their father and grandfather were, in very deed, on their way to make submission.” “That is well known to me,” said Sir Kasimir.  “Lady, I will do all in my power for you.  The Emperor shall hear the state of things; and, while no violence is offered to travellers,” he added, lowering his tone, “I doubt not he will wait for full submission till this young Baron be of age to tender it.” “We are scarce in force to offer violence,” said Christina sighing.  “I have no power to withstand the Lady Baroness.  I am like a stranger here; but, oh! sir, if the Emperor and Diet will be patient and forbearing with this desolate house, my babes, if they live, shall strive to requite their mercy by loyalty.  And the blessing of the widow and fatherless will fall on you, most generous knight,” she added, fervently, holding out her hand. “I would I could do more for you,” said the knight.  “Ask, and all I can do is at your service.” “Ah, sir,” cried Christina, her eyes brightening, “there is one most inestimable service you could render me—to let my uncle, Master Gottfried, the wood-carver of Ulm, know where I am, and of my state, and of my children.” Sir Kasimir repeated the name. “Yes,” she said.  “There was my home, there was I brought up by my dear uncle and aunt, till my father bore me away to attend on the young lady here.  It is eighteen months since they had any tidings from her who was as a daughter to them.” “I will see them myself,” said Kasimir; “I know the name.  Carved not Master Gottfried the stall-work at Augsburg?” “Yes, indeed!  In chestnut leaves!  And the Misereres all with fairy tales!” exclaimed Christina.  “Oh, sir, thanks indeed!  Bear to the dear, dear uncle and aunt their child’s duteous greetings, and tell them she loves them with all her heart, and prays them to forgive her, and to pray for her and her little ones!  And,” she added, “my uncle may not have learnt how his brother, my father, died by his lord’s side.  Oh! pray him, if ever he loved his little Christina, to have masses sung for my father and my own dear lord.” ",clank turret stair step bring many memory lead bedside surprise great flat face coarse comeliness german wench treat lady order deceive delicate lily like face white ivory soft sweet brown eye drooping lash full innocence sad thankful content feel inquiry sacrilege enough world agent clumsy imposition pure white creature arm encircle swaddle babe red face bald head allow appear mummy like wrapping obeisance low respectful favour few word inquiry apology son right defend more spirit secure own position delicate rose tint cheek soft voice noble sir learn wedd dear bless lord brotherhood agent sell indulgence lay brethren present dear lord give own name full holy rite friar promise testimony need find least hear own cloister hermit chapel beheld part ceremony enough enough lady reply forgive force question reply blush deepening due soft eye gleam exultation mummy inquiry full lady needful establishment son right free empire doubt part desire controvert right convinced wish serve cousin head family add undistinguishable chrysalise alike oblige black ribbon medal hang neck elder put knee ground kiss red cheek infant white hand mother lady cousin stand time anxious uneasy scowl expression face satisfied own babe true trouble heritage point way serve represent obtain wardship able protect attack enemy house thanks sir return elder lady gratified implor face right line care greedy guardian appoint usurper submission emperor dispose wardship defiant regard grandson ready blast daughter law eye murmure thanks noble sir thanks let least win friendly young cousin draw pity admiration mother perceive more grandmother haughty repulsiveness want comprehension danger position baptize let become godfather face joy gratitude grandmother objection fact babe only chance noble sponsor ready baptism send hall move half way stair hold council one bustle remain seat chair place bed able thank add more cause lady grandmother remember offer protection poor orphan father grandfather deed way submission power emperor hear state thing violence offer traveller add lower tone doubt wait full submission young age tender scarce force offer violence sigh power withstand stranger sir emperor patient forbear desolate house babe live strive requite mercy loyalty blessing widow fatherless fall generous knight add hold hand more knight ask service sir cry eye brighten inestimable service render let uncle wood carver state child repeat name home bring dear uncle aunt father bear attend young lady month tiding daughter name carve master stall work chestnut leave fairy tale exclaim sir thanks bear dear dear uncle aunt child duteous greeting love heart pray forgive pray one add uncle learn brother father die lord side pray love mass sung father own dear lord
