" Imprisonment--Sinking hopes--Unexpected freedom to more than one, and in more senses than one. For a long long month we remained in our dark and dreary prison, during which dismal time we did not see the face of a human being, except that of the silent savage who brought us our daily food. There have been one or two seasons in my life during which I have felt as if the darkness of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart could never pass away, until death should make me cease to feel the present was such a season. During the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill at our hearts every time we heard a foot-fall near the cave--dreading lest it should prove to be that of our executioner.  But as time dragged heavily on, we ceased to feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep, irrepressible longing for freedom, that we chafed and fretted in our confinement like tigers.  Then a feeling of despair came over us, and we actually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to die! But these changes took place very gradually, and were mingled sometimes with brighter thoughts; for there were times when we sat in that dark cavern on our ledge of rock and conversed almost pleasantly about the past, until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present.  But we seldom ventured to touch upon the future. A few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed; and a scanty supply of yams and taro, brought to us once a-day, constituted our food. ""Well, Ralph, how have you slept?"" said Jack, in a listless tone, on rising one morning from his humble couch.  ""Were you much disturbed by the wind last night?"" ""No,"" said I; ""I dreamed of home all night, and I thought that my mother smiled upon me, and beckoned me to go to her; but I could not, for I was chained."" ""And I dreamed, too,"" said Peterkin; ""but it was of our happy home on the Coral Island.  I thought we were swimming in the Water Garden; then the savages gave a yell, and we were immediately in the cave at Spouting Cliff, which, somehow or other, changed into this gloomy cavern; and I awoke to find it true."" Peterkin's tone was so much altered by the depressing influence of his long imprisonment, that, had I not known it was he who spoke, I should scarcely have recognised it, so sad was it, and so unlike to the merry, cheerful voice we had been accustomed to hear.  I pondered this much, and thought of the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human beings in so short a time; how bright the sunshine in the sky at one time, and, in a short space, how dark the overshadowing cloud!  I had no doubt that the Bible would have given me much light and comfort on this subject, if I had possessed one, and I once more had occasion to regret deeply having neglected to store my memory with its consoling truths. While I meditated thus, Peterkin again broke the silence of the cave, by saying, in a melancholy tone, ""Oh, I wonder if we shall ever see our dear island more."" His voice trembled, and, covering his face with both hands, he bent down his head and wept.  It was an unusual sight for me to see our once joyous companion in tears, and I felt a burning desire to comfort him; but, alas! what could I say?  I could hold out no hope; and although I essayed twice to speak, the words refused to pass my lips.  While I hesitated, Jack sat down beside him, and whispered a few words in his ear, while Peterkin threw himself on his friend's breast, and rested his head on his shoulder. Thus we sat for some time in deep silence.  Soon after, we heard footsteps at the entrance of the cave, and immediately our jailer entered.  We were so much accustomed to his regular visits, however, that we paid little attention to him, expecting that he would set down our meagre fare, as usual, and depart.  But, to our surprise, instead of doing so, he advanced towards us with a knife in his hand, and, going up to Jack, he cut the thongs that bound his wrists, then he did the same to Peterkin and me!  For fully five minutes we stood in speechless amazement, with our freed hands hanging idly by our sides.  The first thought that rushed into my mind was, that the time had come to put us to death; and although, as I have said before, we actually wished for death in the strength of our despair, now that we thought it drew really near I felt all the natural love of life revive in my heart, mingled with a chill of horror at the suddenness of our call. But I was mistaken.  After cutting our bonds, the savage pointed to the cave's mouth, and we marched, almost mechanically, into the open air. Here, to our surprise, we found the teacher standing under a tree, with his hands clasped before him, and the tears trickling down his dark cheeks.  On seeing Jack, who came out first, he sprang towards him, and clasping him in his arms, exclaimed,-- ""Oh! my dear young friend, through the great goodness of God you are free!"" ""Free!"" cried Jack. ""Ay, free,"" repeated the teacher, shaking us warmly by the hands again and again; ""free to go and come as you will.  The Lord has unloosed the bands of the captive and set the prisoners free.  A missionary has been sent to us, and Tararo has embraced the Christian religion!  The people are even now burning their gods of wood!  Come, my dear friends, and see the glorious sight."" We could scarcely credit our senses.  So long had we been accustomed in our cavern to dream of deliverance, that we imagined for a moment this must surely be nothing more than another vivid dream.  Our eyes and minds were dazzled, too, by the brilliant sunshine, which almost blinded us after our long confinement to the gloom of our prison, so that we felt giddy with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our throbbing bosoms; but as we followed the footsteps of our sable friend, and beheld the bright foliage of the trees, and heard the cries of the paroquets, and smelt the rich perfume of the flowering shrubs, the truth, that we were really delivered from prison and from death, rushed with overwhelming power into our souls, and, with one accord, while tears sprang to our eyes, we uttered a loud long cheer of joy.
