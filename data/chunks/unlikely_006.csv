" THERE was once a lady who found herself in middle life with but a slight income. Knowing herself to be insufficiently educated to be able to practise any other trade or calling, she of course decided, without hesitation, to enter the profession of teaching. She opened a very select Boarding School for Young Ladies. The highest references were given and required. And in order to keep her school as select as possible, Miss Fitzroy Robinson had a brass plate fastened on to the door, with an inscription in small polite lettering. (You have, of course, heard of the “polite letters.” Well, it was with these that Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s door-plate was engraved.)   “SELECT BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE    DAUGHTERS OF RESPECTABLE MONARCHS.” A great many kings who were not at all respectable would have given their royal ears to be allowed to send their daughters to this school, but Miss Fitzroy Robinson was very firm about references, and the consequence was that all the really high-class kings were only too pleased to be permitted to pay ten thousand pounds a year for their daughters’ education. And so Miss Fitzroy Robinson was able to lay aside a few pounds as a provision for her old age. And all the money she saved was invested in land. Only one monarch refused to send his daughter to Miss Fitzroy Robinson, on the ground that so cheap a school could not be a really select one, and it was found out afterwards that his references were not at all satisfactory. There were only six boarders, and of course the best masters were engaged to teach the royal pupils everything which their parents wished them to learn, and as the girls were never asked to do lessons except when they felt quite inclined, they all said it was the nicest school in the world, and cried at the very thought of being taken away. Thus it happened that the six pupils were quite grown up and were just becoming parlour boarders when events began to occur. Princess Daisy, the daughter of King Fortunatus, the ruling sovereign, was the only little girl in the school. Now it was when she had been at school about a year, that a ring came at the front door-bell, and the maid-servant came to the schoolroom with a visiting card held in the corner of her apron—for her hands were wet because it was washing-day. “A gentleman to see you, Miss,” she said; and Miss Fitzroy Robinson was quite fluttered because she thought it might be a respectable monarch, with a daughter who wanted teaching. But when she looked at the card she left off fluttering, and said, “Dear me!” under her breath, because she was very genteel. If she had been vulgar like some of us she would have said “Bother!” and if she had been more vulgar than, I hope, any of us are, she might have said “Drat the man!” The card was large and shiny and had gold letters on it. Miss Fitzroy Robinson read:—   Chevalier Doloro De Lara   Professor of Magic (white)   and the Black Art.   Pupils instructed at their own residences.   No extras.   Special terms for Schools. Evening Parties   attended. Miss Fitzroy Robinson laid down her book—she never taught without a book—smoothed her yellow cap and her grey curls and went into the front parlour to see her visitor. He bowed low at sight of her. He was very tall and hungry-looking, with black eyes, and an indescribable mouth. “It is indeed a pleasure,” said he, smiling so as to show every one of his thirty-two teeth—a very polite, but very difficult thing to do—“it is indeed a pleasure to meet once more my old pupil.” “The pleasure is mutual, I am sure,” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson. If it is sometimes impossible to be polite and truthful at the same moment, that is not my fault, nor Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s. “I have been travelling about,” said the Professor, still smiling immeasurably, “increasing my stock of wisdom. Ah, dear lady—we live and learn, do we not? And now I am really a far more competent teacher than when I had the honour of instructing you. May I hope for an engagement as Professor in your Academy?” “I have not yet been able to arrange for a regular course of Magic,” said the schoolmistress; “it is a subject in which parents, especially royal ones, take but too little interest.” “It was your favourite study,” said the professor. “Yes—but—well, no doubt some day——” “But I want an engagement _now_,” said he, looking hungrier than ever; “a thousand pounds for thirteen lessons—to _you_, dear lady.” “It’s quite impossible,” said she, and she spoke firmly, for she knew from history how dangerous it is for a Magician to be allowed anywhere near a princess. Some harm almost always comes of it. “Oh, very well!” said the Professor. “You see my pupils are all princesses,” she went on, “they don’t require the use of magic, they can get all they want without it.” “Then it’s ‘_No_’?” said he. “It’s ‘No thank you kindly,’” said she. Then, before she could stop him, he sprang past her out at the door, and she heard his boots on the oilcloth of the passage. She flew after him just in time to have the schoolroom door slammed and locked in her face. “Well, I never!” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson. She hastened to the top of the house and hurried down the schoolroom chimney, which had been made with steps, in case of fire or other emergency. She stepped out of the grate on to the schoolroom hearthrug just one second too late. The seven Princesses were all gone, and the Professor of Magic stood alone among the ink-stained desks, smiling the largest smile Miss Fitzroy Robinson had seen yet. “Oh, you naughty, bad, wicked man, you!” said she, shaking the school ruler at him. The next day was Saturday, and the King of the country called as usual to take his daughter Daisy out to spend her half holiday. The servant who opened the door had a coarse apron on and cinders in her hair, and the King thought it was sackcloth and ashes, and said so a little anxiously, but the girl said, “No, I’ve only been a-doing of the kitchen range—though, for the matter of that—but you’d best see missus herself.” So the King was shown into the best parlour where the tasteful wax-flowers were, and the antimacassars and water-colour drawings executed by the pupils, and the wool mats which Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s bed-ridden aunt made so beautifully. A delightful parlour full of the traces of the refining touch of a woman’s hand. Miss Fitzroy Robinson came in slowly and sadly. Her gown was neatly made of sack-cloth—with an ingenious trimming of small cinders sewn on gold braid—and some larger-sized cinders dangled by silken threads from the edge of her lace cap. The King saw at once that she was annoyed about something. “I hope I’m not too early,” said he. “Your Majesty,” she answered, “not at all. You are always punctual, as stated in your references. Something has happened. I will not aggravate your misfortunes by breaking them to you. Your daughter Daisy, the pride and treasure of our little circle, has disappeared. Her six royal companions are with her. For the present all are safe, but at the moment I am unable to lay my hand on any one of the seven.” ",lady find middle life slight income educate able practise other trade calling course decide hesitation enter profession teaching open select boarding young high reference give require order keep school select possible brass plate fasten door inscription small polite lettering course hear polite letter door plate engrave select boarding establishment daughter respectable monarchs great many king respectable give royal ear allow send daughter school firm reference consequence high class king pleased permit pay pound year daughter education able lay few pound provision old age money save invest land monarch refuse send daughter ground cheap school select one find reference satisfactory border course master engage teach royal pupil parent wish learn girl ask lesson feel inclined nice school world cry very thought happen pupil grow become parlour border event begin occur daughter ruling sovereign only girl school school year ring front door bell maid servant schoolroom visit card hold corner apron hand wet wash day gentleman flutter respectable monarch daughter want teaching card leave flutter breath genteel vulgar bother vulgar hope man card large shiny gold letter read black instruct own residence extra special term school evening party attend lay book teach book smooth yellow cap grey curl front parlour visitor bow low sight tall hungry black eye indescribable mouth pleasure smile show one tooth polite difficult thing pleasure meet old pupil pleasure mutual sure impossible polite truthful same moment fault travel smile increase stock wisdom dear lady live learn competent teacher honour instruct hope engagement able arrange regular course schoolmistress subject parent royal one interest favourite study professor doubt day want engagement hungry pound lesson dear lady impossible speak history dangerous magician allow princess harm  pupil princess require use magic want  thank stop spring door hear boot oilcloth passage fly time schoolroom door slam lock face hasten top house hurry schoolroom chimney step case fire other emergency step grate schoolroom hearthrug second late gone stand ink stain desk smile large smile naughty bad wicked man shake school ruler next day country call usual daughter spend half holiday servant open door coarse apron cinder hair sackcloth ash girl kitchen range matter missus show parlour tasteful wax flower antimacassar water colour drawing execute pupil wool mat bed ride aunt delightful parlour full trace refine touch woman hand gown sack cloth ingenious trimming small cinder sew gold braid large sized cinder dangle silken thread edge lace cap annoyed hope early answer punctual state reference happen aggravate misfortune break daughter pride treasure circle disappear royal companion present safe moment unable lay hand 
"The King sat down heavily on part of the handsome walnut and rep suite (ladies’ and gentlemen’s easy-chairs, couch and six occasional chairs) and gasped miserably. He could not find words. But the schoolmistress had written down what she was going to say on a slate and learned it off by heart, so she was able to go on fluently. “Your Majesty, I am not wholly to blame—hang me if I am—I mean hang me if you must; but first allow me to have the honour of offering to you one or two explanatory remarks.” With this she sat down and told him the whole story of the Professor’s visit, only stopping exactly where I stopped when I was telling it to you just now. The King listened, plucking nervously at the fringe of a purple and crimson antimacassar. “I never _was_ satisfied with the Professor’s methods,” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson sadly; “and I always had my doubts as to his moral character, doubts now set at rest for ever. After concluding my course of instruction with him some years ago I took a series of lessons from a far more efficient master, and thanks to those lessons, which were, I may mention, extremely costly, I was mercifully enabled to put a spoke in the wheel of the unprincipled ruffian——” “Did you save the Princesses?” cried the King. “No; but I can if your Majesty and the other parents will leave the matter entirely in my hands.” “It’s rather a serious matter,” said the King; “my poor little Daisy——” “I would ask you,” said the schoolmistress with dignity, “not to attach too much importance to this event. Of course it is regrettable, but unpleasant accidents occur in all schools, and the consequences of them can usually be averted by the exercise of tact and judgment.” “I ought to hang you, you know,” said the King doubtfully. “No doubt,” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson, “and if you do you’ll never see your Daisy again. Your duty as a parent—yes—and your duty to me—conflicting duties are very painful things.” “But can I trust you?” “I may remind you,” said she, drawing herself up so that the cinders rattled again, “that we exchanged satisfactory references at the commencement of our business relations.” The King rose. “Well, Miss Fitzroy Robinson,” he said, “I have been entirely satisfied with Daisy’s progress since she has been in your charge, and I feel I cannot do better than leave this matter entirely in your able hands.” The schoolmistress made him a curtsey, and he went back to his marble palace a broken-hearted monarch, with his crown all on one side and his poor, dear nose red with weeping. The select boarding establishment was shut up. Time went on and no news came of the lost Princesses. The King found but little comfort in the fact that his other child, Prince Denis, was still spared to him. Denis was all very well and a nice little boy in his way, but a boy is not a girl. The Queen was much more broken-hearted than the King, but of course she had the housekeeping to see to and the making of the pickles and preserves and the young Prince’s stockings to knit, so she had not much time for weeping, and after a year she said to the King— “My dear, you ought to do something to distract your mind. It’s unkinglike to sit and cry all day. Now, do make an effort; do something useful, if it’s only opening a bazaar or laying a foundation stone.” “I am frightened of bazaars,” said the King; “they are like bees—they buzz and worry; but foundation stones——” And after that he began to sit and think sometimes, without crying, and to make notes on the backs of old envelopes. So the Queen felt that she had not spoken quite in vain. A month later the suggestion of foundation stones bore fruit. The King floated a company, and Fortunatus Rex & Co. became almost at once the largest speculative builders in the world. Perhaps you do not know what a speculative builder is. I’ll tell you what the King and his Co. did, and then you will know. They bought all the pretty woods and fields they could get and cut them up into squares, and grubbed up the trees and the grass and put streets there and lamp-posts and ugly little yellow brick houses, in the hopes that people would want to live in them. And curiously enough people did. So the King and his Co. made quite a lot of money. It is curious that nearly all the great fortunes are made by turning beautiful things into ugly ones. Making beauty out of ugliness is very ill-paid work. The ugly little streets crawled further and further out of the town, eating up the green country like greedy yellow caterpillars, but at the foot of the Clover Hill they had to stop. For the owner of Clover Hill would not sell any land at all—for any price that Fortunatus Rex & Co. could offer. In vain the solicitors of the Company called on the solicitors of the owner, wearing their best cloaks and swords and shields, and took them out to lunch and gave them nice things to eat and drink. Clover Hill was not for sale. At last, however, a little old woman all in grey called at the Company’s shining brass and mahogany offices and had a private interview with the King himself. “I am the owner of Clover Hill,” said she, “and you may build on all its acres except the seven at the top and the fifteen acres that go round that seven, and you must build me a high wall round the seven acres and another round the fifteen—of _red_ brick, mind; none of your cheap yellow stuff—and you must make a brand new law that any one who steals my fruit is to be hanged from the tree he stole it from. That’s all. What do you say?” The King said “Yes,” because since his trouble he cared for nothing but building, and his royal soul longed to see the green Clover Hill eaten up by yellow brick caterpillars with slate tops. He did not at all like building the two red brick walls, but he did it. Now, the old woman wanted the walls and the acres to be this sort of shape—  But it was such a bother getting the exact amount of ground into the two circles that all the surveyors tore out their hair by handfuls, and at last the King said, “Oh bother! Do it this way,” and drew a plan on the back of an old Act of Parliament. So they did, and it was like this—               +---+---+               | 1 | 2 |   +---+---+---+---+---+   | 13| 14| 15| I | 3 |   +---+---+---+---+---+   | 12| II|III| IV| 4 |   +---+---+---+---+---+   | 11| V | VI|VII| 5 |   +---+---+---+---+---+   | 10| 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 |   +---+---+---+---+---+  The old lady was very vexed when she found that there was only one wall between her orchard and the world, as you see was the case at the corner where the two 1’s and the 15 meet; but the King said he couldn’t afford to build it all over again and that she’d got her two walls as she had said. So she had to put up with it. Only she insisted on the King’s getting her a fierce bull-dog to fly at the throat of any one who should come over the wall at that weak point where the two 1’s join on to the 15. So he got her a stout bull-dog whose name was Martha, and brought it himself in a jewelled leash. “Martha will fly at any one who is not of kingly blood,” said he. “Of course she wouldn’t dream of biting a royal person; but, then, on the other hand, royal people don’t rob orchards.” ",sit part handsome walnut rep suite lady gentleman easy chair couch occasional chair gasp find word schoolmistress write slate learn heart able blame hang mean hang allow honour offer explanatory remark sit whole story visit stop stop listen pluck fringe purple crimson antimacassar satisfied method doubt moral character doubt set rest conclude course instruction year series lesson efficient master thanks lesson mention costly enable put speak wheel unprincipled ruffian save cry other parent leave matter hand serious matter poor ask schoolmistress dignity attach much importance event course regrettable unpleasant accident occur school consequence avert exercise tact judgment hang doubt duty parent duty conflict duty painful thing trust remind draw cinder rattle exchange satisfactory reference commencement business relation rise satisfied progress charge feel leave matter able hand schoolmistress curtsey marble palace break hearted monarch crown side poor dear nose red weeping select boarding establishment shut time news lose princess find comfort fact other child spare nice boy way boy girl break hearted course housekeeping making pickle preserve young stocking knit much time weeping year dear distract mind unkinglike sit cry day effort useful open bazaar lay foundation stone frighten bazaar bee buzz worry foundation stone begin sit cry note back old envelope feel speak vain month suggestion foundation stone bear fruit float company become large speculative builder world speculative builder buy pretty wood field cut square grubb tree grass put street lamp post ugly yellow brick house hope person want live enough person lot money curious great fortune turn beautiful thing ugly one beauty ugliness ill pay work ugly street crawl town eat green country greedy yellow caterpillar foot stop owner sell land price offer vain solicitor company call solicitor owner wear cloak sword shield lunch give nice thing eat drink sale last old woman grey call company shine brass mahogany office private interview owner build acre top acre build high wall acre brick mind cheap yellow stuff brand new law one steal fruit hang tree steal trouble care building royal soul long green eat yellow brick caterpillar slate top build red brick wall old woman want wall acre sort shape bother exact amount ground circle surveyor tore hair handful last bother way draw plan back old  old lady vexed find wall orchard world case corner meet afford build wall put insist fierce bull dog fly throat one wall weak point join stout bull dog name bring jewell leash fly one kingly blood course dream bite royal person other hand royal person rob orchard 
"So the old woman had to be contented. She tied Martha up in the unprotected corner of her inner enclosure and then she planted little baby apple trees and had a house built and sat down in it and waited. And the King was almost happy. The creepy, crawly yellow caterpillars ate up Clover Hill—all except the little green crown on the top, where the apple trees were and the two red brick walls and the little house and the old woman. The poor Queen went on seeing to the jam and the pickles and the blanket washing and the spring cleaning, and every now and then she would say to her husband— “Fortunatus, my love, do you _really_ think Miss Fitzroy Robinson is trustworthy? Shall we ever see our Daisy again?” And the King would rumple his fair hair with his hands till it stuck out like cheese straws under his crown, and answer— “My dear, you must be patient; you know we had the very highest references.” Now one day the new yellow brick town the King had built had a delightful experience. Six handsome Princes on beautiful white horses came riding through the dusty little streets. The housings of their chargers shone with silver embroidery and gleaming glowing jewels, and their gold armour flashed so gloriously in the sun that all the little children clapped their hands, and the Princes’ faces were so young and kind and handsome that all the old women said: “Bless their pretty hearts!” Now, of course, you will not need to be told that these six Princes were looking for the six grown-up Princesses who had been so happy at the Select Boarding Establishment. Their six Royal fathers, who lived many years’ journey away on the other side of the world, and had not yet heard that the Princesses were mislaid, had given Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s address to these Princes, and instructed them to marry the six Princesses without delay, and bring them home. But when they got to the Select Boarding Establishment for the Daughters of Respectable Monarchs, the house was closed, and a card was in the window, saying that this desirable villa residence was to be let on moderate terms, furnished or otherwise. The wax fruit under the glass shade still showed attractively through the dusty panes. The six Princes looked through the window by turns. They were charmed with the furniture, and the refining touch of a woman’s hand drew them like a magnet. They took the house, but they had their meals at the Palace by the King’s special invitation. King Fortunatus told the Princes the dreadful story of the disappearance of the entire Select School; and each Prince swore by his sword-hilt and his honour that he would find out the particular Princess that he was to marry, or perish in the attempt. For, of course, each Prince was to marry one Princess, mentioned by name in his instructions, and not one of the others. The first night that the Princes spent in the furnished house passed quietly enough, so did the second and the third and the fourth, fifth and sixth, but on the seventh night, as the Princes sat playing spilikins in the schoolroom, they suddenly heard a voice that was not any of theirs. It said, “Open up Africa!” The Princes looked here, there, and everywhere—but they could see no one. They had not been brought up to the exploring trade, and could not have opened up Africa if they had wanted to. “Or cut through the Isthmus of Panama,” said the voice again. Now, as it happened, none of the six Princes were engineers. They confessed as much. “Cut up China, then!” said the voice, desperately. “It’s like the ghost of a Tory newspaper,” said one of the Princes. And then suddenly they knew that the voice came from one of the pair of globes which hung in frames at the end of the schoolroom. It was the terrestrial globe. “I’m inside,” said the voice; “I can’t get out. Oh, cut the globe—anywhere—and let me out. But the African route is most convenient.” Prince Primus opened up Africa with his sword, and out tumbled half a Professor of Magic. “My other half’s in there,” he said, pointing to the Celestial globe. “Let my legs out, do——” But Prince Secundus said, “Not so fast,” and Prince Tertius said, “Why were you shut up?” “I was shut up for as pretty a bit of parlour-magic as ever you saw in all your born days,” said the top half of the Professor of Magic. “Oh, you were, were you?” said Prince Quartus; “well, your legs aren’t coming out just yet. We want to engage a competent magician. You’ll do.” “But I’m not all here,” said the Professor. “Quite enough of you,” said Prince Quintus. “Now look here,” said Prince Sextus; “we want to find our six Princesses. We can give a very good guess as to how they were lost; but we’ll let bygones be bygones. You tell us how to find them, and after our weddings we’ll restore your legs to the light of day.” “This half of me feels so faint,” said the half Professor of Magic. “What are we to do?” said all the Princes, threateningly; “if you don’t tell us, you shall never have a leg to stand on.” “Steal apples,” said the half Professor, hoarsely, and fainted away. They left him lying on the bare boards between the inkstained desks, and off they went to steal apples. But this was not so easy. Because Fortunatus Rex & Co. had built, and built, and built, and apples do not grow freely in those parts of the country which have been “opened up” by speculative builders. So at last they asked the little Prince Denis where he went for apples when he wanted them. And Denis said— “The old woman at the top of Clover Hill has apples in her seven acres, and in her fifteen acres, but there’s a fierce bulldog in the seven acres, and I’ve stolen all the apples in the fifteen acres myself.” “We’ll try the seven acres,” said the Princes. “Very well,” said Denis; “You’ll be hanged if you’re caught. So, as I put you up to it, I’m coming too, and if you won’t take me, I’ll tell. So there!” For Denis was a most honourable little Prince, and felt that you must not send others into danger unless you go yourself, and he would never have stolen apples if it had not been quite as dangerous as leading armies. So the Princes had to agree, and the very next night Denis let himself down out of his window by a knotted rope made of all the stockings his mother had knitted for him, and the grown-up Princes were waiting under the window, and off they all went to the orchard on the top of Clover Hill. They climbed the wall at the proper corner, and Martha, the bulldog, who was very wellbred, and knew a Prince when she saw one, wagged her kinked tail respectfully and wished them good luck. The Princes stole over the dewy orchard grass and looked at tree after tree: there were no apples on any of them. Only at last, in the very middle of the orchard there was a tree with a copper trunk and brass branches, and leaves of silver. And on it hung seven beautiful golden apples. So each Prince took one of the golden apples, very quietly, and off they went, anxious to get back to the half-Professor of Magic, and learn what to do next. No one had any doubt as to the half-Professor having told the truth; for when your legs depend on your speaking the truth you will not willingly tell a falsehood. They stole away as quietly as they could, each with a gold apple in his hand, but as they went Prince Denis could not resist his longing to take a bite out of his apple. He opened his mouth very wide so as to get a good bite, and the next moment he howled aloud, for the apple was as hard as stone, and the poor little boy had broken nearly all his first teeth.
