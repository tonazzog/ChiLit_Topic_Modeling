"     ""And constancy lives in realms above;        And life is thorny; and youth is vain;      And to be wroth with one we love,        Doth work like madness in the brain.      Each spoke words of high disdain        And insult to his heart's best brother."" Wright had not forgotten Montagu's advice, and had endeavored to get the names of boys who wern't afraid to scout publicly the disgrace of cheating in form. But he could only get one name promised him--the name of Vernon Williams; and feeling how little could be gained by using it, he determined to spare Vernon the trial, and speak, if he spoke at all, on his own responsibility. As usual, the cribbing at the next weekly examination was well-nigh universal, and when Mr. Gordon went out to fetch something he had forgotten, merely saying, ""I trust to your honor not to abuse my absence,"" books and papers were immediately pulled out with the coolest and most unblushing indifference. This was the time for Wright to deliver his conscience; he had counted the cost, and, rightly or wrongly considering it to be his duty, he had decided that speak he would. He well knew that his interference would be attributed to jealousy, meanness, sneaking, and every kind of wrong motive, since he was himself one of the greatest sufferers from the prevalent dishonesty; but still he had come to the conclusion that he _ought_ not to draw back, and therefore he bravely determined that he would make his protest, whatever happened. So, very nervously, he rose and said, ""I want to tell you all that I think this cheating very wrong and blackguardly. I don't mind losing by it myself, but if Vernon Williams loses the prize in the lower fourth, and any one gets it by copying, I've made up my mind to tell Gordon."" His voice trembled a little at first, but he spoke fast, and acquired firmness as he went on. Absolute astonishment and curiosity had held the boys silent with amazement, but by the end of this sentence they had recovered themselves, and a perfect burst of derision and indignation followed. ""Let's see if _that'll_ cut short his oration,"" said Wildney, throwing a book at his head, which was instantly followed by others from all quarters. ""My word! we've had nothing but lectures lately,"" said Brooking. ""Horrid little Owenite saint."" ""Saint!--sneak, you mean. I'll teach him,"" growled Pietrie, and jumping up, he belabored Wright's head with the Latin grammar out of which he had just been cribbing. The whole room was in confusion and hubbub, during which Wright sat stock still, quietly enduring without bowing to the storm. Only one boy sympathised with him, but he did so deeply--poor little penitent Vernon. He felt his position hard because Wright had alluded so prominently to him, and he knew how much he must be misconstrued, but he had his brother's spirit, and would not shrink. Amid the tumult he got up in his seat, and they heard his pleasant, childish voice saying boldly, ""I hope Wright won't tell; but he's the best fellow in the room, and cribbing _is_ a shame, as he says."" What notice would have been taken of this speech is doubtful, for at the critical moment Mr. Gordon reappeared, and the whispered cavè caused instantaneous quiet. Poor Wright awaited with some dread the end of school; and many an angry kick and blow he got, though he disarmed malice by the spirit and heroism with which he endured them. The news of his impudence spread like wildfire, and not five boys in the school approved of what he had done, while most of them were furious at his ill-judged threat of informing Mr. Gordon. There was a general agreement to thrash him after roll-call that afternoon. Eric had lately taken a violent dislike to Wright, though he had been fond of him in better days. He used to denounce him as a disagreeable and pragmatical little muff, and was as loud as any of them in condemning his announced determination to ""sneak."" Had he known that Wright had acted under Montagu's well-meant, though rather mistaken advice, he might have abstained from having anything more to do with the matter, but now he promised to kick Wright himself after the four o'clock bell. Four o'clock came; the names were called; the master left the room. Wright, who perfectly knew what was threatened, stood there pale but fearless. His indifferent look was an additional annoyance to Eric, who walked up to him carelessly, and boxing his ears, though without hurting him, said contemptuously, ""Conceited little sneak."" Montagu had been told of the intended kicking, and had determined even single-handed to prevent it. He did _not_, however, expect that Eric would have taken part in it, and was therefore unprepared. The color rushed into his cheeks; he went up, took Wright quietly by the hand, and said with firm determination, ""No one in the school shall touch Wright again."" ""What? no one! just hark to that,"" said Graham; ""I suppose he thinks himself cock of the school."" Eric quite misunderstood Montagu's proceedings; he took it for a public challenge. All the Rowlandites were round, and to yield would have looked like cowardice. Above all, his evil genius Wildney was by, and said, ""How very nice! another dictation lesson!"" A threatening circle had formed round Montagu, but his closed lips, and flushing brow, and dilated nostrils, betrayed a spirit which made them waver, and he quietly repeated, ""No one shall touch you, Wright."" ""They _will_, though,"" said Eric instantly; ""_I_ will, for one, and I should like to see you prevent me."" And so saying he gave Wright another slight blow. Montagu dropped Wright's hand and said slowly, ""Eric Williams, I have taken one unexpected blow from you without a word, and bear the marks of it yet. It is time to show that it was _not_ through cowardice that I did not return it. Will you fight?"" The answer was not prompt by any means, though every one in the school knew that Eric was not afraid. So sure was he of this, that, for the sake of ""auld lang syne,"" he would probably have declined to fight with Montagu had he been left to his own impulses. ""I have been in the wrong, Montagu, more than once,"" he answered, falteringly, ""and we have been friends--"" But it was the object of many of the worst boys that the two should fight--not only that they might see the fun, but that Montagu's authority, which stood in their way, might be flung aside. So Brooking whispered in an audible voice-- ""Faith! he's showing the white feather."" ""You're a liar!"" flung in Eric; and turning to Montagu, he said--""There! I'll fight you this moment."" Instantly they had stripped off their coats and prepared for action. A ring of excited boys crowded round them. Fellows of sixteen, like Montagu and Eric, rarely fight, because their battles have usually been decided in their earlier school-days; and it was also but seldom that two boys so strong, active, and prominent, took this method of settling their differences. The fight began, and at first the popular favor was entirely on the side of Eric, while Montagu found few or none to back him. But he fought with a fire and courage which soon won applause; and as Eric, on the other hand, was random and spiritless, the cry was soon pretty fairly divided between them.
