"CHAPTER 8. A QUARREL AND A CRICKET MATCH. The first number of the _Dominican_ had undoubtedly caused a sensation; and it would have created far more sensation but for the fact that the Alphabet Match was to be played on the following day.  But even this counter-attraction could not wholly divert the mind of Saint Dominic's from this new literary marvel; and a skirmish took place on the very afternoon of its appearance. Pembury and his friends had quite expected that the Sixth would attempt a high-handed blow at their paper, and they were not disappointed.  For no sooner had Loman and his peers stalked away from the scene of their indignation, and found themselves in the retirement of their own room, than they fell to talking in terms the reverse of pleasant about the event of the morning.  The least important of their number was specially wroth. ""There's a great row out in the passage to-day,"" said Raleigh, who was blissfully ignorant of the whole matter; ""why can't some of you monitors keep a little better order?  The Doctor will be wanting to know what it's all about!"" ""All very well,"" said Raikes, one of the monitors; ""but if the Fifth will stick their tomfoolery out in the passage, there's sure to be a row."" ""What tomfoolery?  Some of you are for ever grumbling at the Fifth."" ""And so would you if you saw the complimentary remarks they make about you in this precious newspaper of theirs."" ""Oh, the _Dominican_?  I must have a look at it by and by; but meanwhile something had better be done to stop that row, or we shall catch it ourselves."" And so saying, the captain left these injured youths to their own counsels, which it is to be feared were moved more by dislike for the _Dominican_ than by a burning desire for the good order of the school. However, they must do something; and there would be nothing inconsistent with their dignity in demanding the withdrawal of the obnoxious broadside on account of the noise it caused.  This would be a safe move, and might be checkmate.  Loman was deputed to wait upon the Fifth with the demand of the monitors, and lost no time in carrying out this welcome task.  Class was just over, and the Fifth were just about to clear out of their room when Loman entered.  It was not often that a Sixth Form fellow penetrated into their camp, and had they not guessed his mission they might have resented the intrusion. ""Oh, you fellows,"" began Loman, feeling not quite so confident now as he had felt five minutes ago, ""we can't have that thing of yours hanging out in the passage like that.  It makes a crowd--too much row.  Whose is it?"" ""Not mine,"" said Wraysford, laughing; ""ask Bully--perhaps it's his."" ""Not a bit of it,"" said Bullinger; ""it's yours, isn't it, Simon?"" ""Only part,"" said the poet of the ""Love-Ballad"", ""and I presented that to the paper."" ""Suppose it was mine?"" said Oliver, with a drawl. ""Then,"" said Loman, losing his temper, ""all I can say is, the sooner you clear it away the better."" ""Oh! all right; only it's not mine."" ""Look here,"" said Loman, ""I'm not going to fool about with you.  You may think it all very funny, but I'll report it to the Doctor, and then you'll look foolish."" ""How nice!  So pleasant it will be to look for once like what you look always,"" observed Pembury, gnawing the top of his crutch. At that moment there was a loud shout of laughter in the passage outside, confirming the monitor's complaint.  Wraysford walked hastily to the door. ""The next time there's a row like that outside our door,"" called he to the group outside, ""we'll--what do you mean by it, you young blackguard?"" So saying, he caught Master Bramble, who happened to be the nearest offender within reach, by the collar of his coat, and lugged him bodily into the class-room. ""There, now!  Do you know this gentleman?  He's a monitor.  Have a good look at him.  He's been complaining of the row you are making, and quite rightly.  Take that, and tell all the little Pigs outside that if they don't hold their noise they will find themselves, every man jack of them, _mentioned by name_ in the next number!"" So saying, with a gentle cuff he handed the ill-starred Master Bramble out again to his fellows, and from that time there was scarcely a sound audible from the passage. ""Good-bye,"" said Pembury, kissing his hand to Loman, who all this time had been standing in the middle of the room, in a white heat, and perplexed what to do or say next. ""You aren't going to live here, are you?"" asked Bullinger. ""Any one got a toffee-drop?"" drily inquired Oliver.  To his surprise, and to the surprise of every one, Loman wheeled round towards the last speaker, and without a word struck him a blow on the mouth with his hand. He saw he had made a mistake, and looked ashamed the moment the deed was done.  All eyes turned to Oliver, whose face was crimson with a sudden flush of pain and anger.  He sprang to his feet, and Braddy, the bully, was already beginning to gloat over the prospect of a fight, when, to every one's amazement, Oliver coolly put his hands back into his pockets, and walking up to Loman said, quietly, ""Hadn't you better go?"" Loman stared at him in astonishment.  He had at least expected to be knocked down, and this, behaviour was quite incomprehensible. He turned on his heel and quitted the room without a word; and somehow or other from that time the Fifth heard no more protests from the monitors on the subject of the _Dominican_. But Oliver's conduct, much as it had astonished the person chiefly concerned, had astonished the Fifth still more.  For the first time in the history of their class, as far as they could recollect, a blow struck had not been returned, and they could not tell what to make of it. The blow had been a cowardly one, and certainly unmerited, and by all schoolboy tradition one fairly demanding a return.  Could it be possible their man was lacking in courage?  The idea was a shock to most present, who, although Oliver was never very popular among them, as has been said, had never before suspected his pluck.  In fact, it was an awkward moment for all, and it was quite a relief when Simon broke silence by asking Oliver, ""Why didn't you knock him down, I say?"" ""Because I did not choose, if you want to know,"" replied Oliver, shortly. ""Oh!  I beg your pardon,"" replied Simon, rather taken aback by this brusque answer. This was not satisfactory.  Had the offender been a Guinea-pig, one could have understood the thing; but when it was a Sixth Form fellow--a good match in every respect, as well as a rival--the Fifth were offended at their man for drawing back as he had done. ""I suppose you _will_ fight him?"" said Ricketts, in a voice which implied that there was no doubt about it. ""Do you?"" replied Oliver, briefly. The boy's manner was certainly not winsome, and, when once put out, it was evident he took no trouble to conceal the fact.  He refused to answer any further questions on the subject, and presently quitted the room, leaving more than half his class-fellows convinced that, after all, he _was_ a coward. An angry discussion followed his departure. ""He ought to be made to fight, whether he likes or not,"" said Braddy the bully. ""Some one ought to pay Loman out,"" suggested Ricketts, ""if Greenfield doesn't."" ""A nice name we shall get, all of us,"" said Bullinger, ""when it gets abroad all over the school."" ""It's a shame, because one fellow funks, for the whole Form to be disgraced; that's what I say,"" said some one else.
