" When Ventimore woke next morning his headache had gone, and with it the recollection of everything but the wondrous and delightful fact that Sylvia loved him and had promised to be his some day. Her mother, too, was on his side; why should he despair of anything after that? There was the Professor, to be sure--but even he might be brought to consent to an engagement, especially if it turned out that the brass bottle ... and here Horace began to recall an extraordinary dream in connection with that extremely speculative purchase of his. He had dreamed that he had forced the bottle open, and that it proved to contain, not manuscripts, but an elderly Jinnee who alleged that he had been imprisoned there by the order of King Solomon! What, he wondered, could have put so grotesque a fancy into his head? and then he smiled as he traced it to Sylvia's playful suggestion that the bottle might contain a ""genie,"" as did the famous jar in the ""Arabian Nights,"" and to her father's pedantic correction of the word to ""Jinnee."" Upon that slight foundation his sleeping brain had built up all that elaborate fabric--a scene so vivid and a story so circumstantial and plausible that, in spite of its extravagance, he could hardly even now persuade himself that it was entirely imaginary. The psychology of dreams is a subject which has a fascinating mystery, even for the least serious student. As he entered the sitting-room, where his breakfast awaited him, he looked round, half expecting to find the bottle lying with its lid off in the corner, as he had last seen it in his dream. Of course, it was not there, and he felt an odd relief. The auction-room people had not delivered it yet, and so much the better, for he had still to ascertain if it had anything inside it; and who knew that it might not contain something more to his advantage than a maundering old Jinnee with a grievance several thousands of years old? Breakfast over, he rang for his landlady, who presently appeared. Mrs. Rapkin was a superior type of her much-abused class. She was scrupulously clean and neat in her person; her sandy hair was so smooth and tightly knotted that it gave her head the colour and shape of a Barcelona nut; she had sharp, beady eyes, nostrils that seemed to smell battle afar off, a wide, thin mouth that apparently closed with a snap, and a dry, whity-brown complexion suggestive of bran. But if somewhat grim of aspect, she was a good soul and devoted to Horace, in whom she took almost a maternal interest, while regretting that he was not what she called ""serious-minded enough"" to get on in the world. Rapkin had wooed and married her when they were both in service, and he still took occasional jobs as an outdoor butler, though Horace suspected that his more staple form of industry was the consumption of gin-and-water and remarkably full-flavoured cigars in the basement parlour. ""Shall you be dining in this evening, sir?"" inquired Mrs. Rapkin. ""I don't know. Don't get anything in for me; I shall most probably dine at the club,"" said Horace; and Mrs. Rapkin, who had a confirmed belief that all clubs were hotbeds of vice and extravagance, sniffed disapproval. ""By the way,"" he added, ""if a kind of brass pot is sent here, it's all right. I bought it at a sale yesterday. Be careful how you handle it--it's rather old."" ""There _was_ a vawse come late last night, sir; I don't know if it's that, it's old-fashioned enough."" ""Then will you bring it up at once, please? I want to see it."" Mrs. Rapkin retired, to reappear presently with the brass bottle. ""I thought you'd have noticed it when you come in last night, sir,"" she explained, ""for I stood it in the corner, and when I see it this morning it was layin' o' one side and looking that dirty and disrespectable I took it down to give it a good clean, which it wanted it."" It certainly looked rather the better for it, and the marks or scratches on the cap were more distinguishable, but Horace was somewhat disconcerted to find that part of his dream was true--the bottle had been there. ""I hope I've done nothing wrong,"" said Mrs. Rapkin, observing his expression; ""I only used a little warm ale to it, which is a capital thing for brass-work, and gave it a scrub with 'Vitrolia' soap--but it would take more than that to get all the muck off of it."" ""It is all right, so long as you didn't try to get the top off,"" said Horace. ""Why, the top _was_ off it, sir. I thought you'd done it with the 'ammer and chisel when you got 'ome,"" said his landlady, staring. ""I found them 'ere on the carpet."" Horace started. Then _that_ part was true, too! ""Oh, ah,"" he said, ""I believe I did. I'd forgotten. That reminds me. Haven't you let the room above to--to an Oriental gentleman--a native, you know--wears a green turban?"" ""That I most certainly 'ave _not_, Mr. Ventimore,"" said Mrs. Rapkin, with emphasis, ""nor wouldn't. Not if his turbin was all the colours of the rainbow--for I don't 'old with such. Why, there was Rapkin's own sister-in-law let her parlour floor to a Horiental--a Parsee _he_ was, or _one_ o' them Hafrican tribes--and reason she 'ad to repent of it, for all his gold spectacles! Whatever made you fancy I should let to a blackamoor?"" ""Oh, I thought I saw somebody about--er--answering that description, and I wondered if----"" ""Never in _this_ 'ouse, sir. Mrs. Steggars, next door but one, might let to such, for all I can say to the contrary, not being what you might call particular, and her rooms more suitable to savage notions--but I've enough on _my_ hands, Mr. Ventimore, attending to you--not keeping a girl to do the waiting, as why should I while I'm well able to do it better myself?"" As soon as she relieved him of her presence, he examined the bottle: there was nothing whatever inside it, which disposed of all the hopes he had entertained from that quarter. It was not difficult to account for the visionary Oriental as an hallucination probably inspired by the heavy fumes (for he now believed in the fumes) which had doubtless resulted from the rapid decomposition of some long-buried spices or similar substances suddenly exposed to the air. If any further explanation were needed, the accidental blow to the back of his head, together with the latent suggestion from the ""Arabian Nights,"" would amply provide it. So, having settled these points to his entire satisfaction, he went to his office in Great Cloister Street, which he now had entirely to himself, and was soon engaged in drafting the specification for Beevor on which he had been working when so fortunately interrupted the day before by the Professor. The work was more or less mechanical, and could bring him no credit and little thanks, but Horace had the happy faculty of doing thoroughly whatever he undertook, and as he sat there by his wide-open window he soon became entirely oblivious of all but the task before him. So much so that, even when the light became obscured for a moment, as if by some large and opaque body in passing, he did not look up immediately, and, when he did, was surprised to find the only armchair occupied by a portly person, who seemed to be trying to recover his breath.

"""I beg your pardon,"" said Ventimore; ""I never heard you come in."" His visitor could only wave his head in courteous deprecation, under which there seemed a suspicion of bewildered embarrassment. He was a rosy-gilled, spotlessly clean, elderly gentleman, with white whiskers; his eyes, just then slightly protuberant, were shrewd, but genial; he had a wide, jolly mouth and a double chin. He was dressed like a man who is above disguising his prosperity; he wore a large, pear-shaped pearl in his crimson scarf, and had probably only lately discarded his summer white hat and white waistcoat. ""My dear sir,"" he began, in a rich, throaty voice, as soon as he could speak; ""my dear sir, you must think this is a most unceremonious way of--ah!--dropping in on you--of invading your privacy."" ""Not at all,"" said Horace, wondering whether he could possibly intend him to understand that he had come in by the window. ""I'm afraid there was no one to show you in--my clerk is away just now."" ""No matter, sir, no matter. I found my way up, as you perceive. The important, I may say the essential, fact is that I _am_ here."" ""Quite so,"" said Horace, ""and may I ask what brought you?"" ""What brought----"" The stranger's eyes grew fish-like for the moment. ""Allow me, I--I shall come to that--in good time. I am still a little--as you can see."" He glanced round the room. ""You are, I think, an architect, Mr. ah--Mr. um----?"" ""Ventimore is my name,"" said Horace, ""and I _am_ an architect."" ""Ventimore, to be sure!"" he put his hand in his pocket and produced a card: ""Yes, it's all quite correct: I see I have the name here. And an architect, Mr. Ventimore, so I--I am given to understand, of immense ability."" ""I'm afraid I can't claim to be that,"" said Horace, ""but I may call myself fairly competent."" ""Competent? Why, of _course_ you're competent. Do you suppose, sir, that I, a practical business man, should come to any one who was _not_ competent?"" he said, with exactly the air of a man trying to convince himself--against his own judgment--that he was acting with the utmost prudence. ""Am I to understand that some one has been good enough to recommend me to you?"" inquired Horace. ""Certainly not, sir, certainly not. _I_ need no recommendation but my own judgment. I--ah--have a tolerable acquaintance with all that is going on in the art world, and I have come to the conclusion, Mr.--eh--ah--Ventimore, I repeat, the deliberate and unassisted conclusion, that you are the one man living who can do what I want."" ""Delighted to hear it,"" said Horace, genuinely gratified. ""When did you see any of my designs?"" ""Never mind, sir. I don't decide without very good grounds. It doesn't take me long to make up my mind, and when my mind is made up, I act, sir, I act. And, to come to the point, I have a small commission--unworthy, I am quite aware, of your--ah--distinguished talent--which I should like to put in your hands."" ""Is _he_ going to ask me to attend a sale for him?"" thought Horace. ""I'm hanged if I do."" ""I'm rather busy at present,"" he said dubiously, ""as you may see. I'm not sure whether----"" ""I'll put the matter in a nutshell, sir--in a nutshell. My name is Wackerbath, Samuel Wackerbath--tolerably well known, if I may say so, in City circles."" Horace, of course, concealed the fact that his visitor's name and fame were unfamiliar to him. ""I've lately bought a few acres on the Hampshire border, near the house I'm living in just now; and I've been thinking--as I was saying to a friend only just now, as we were crossing Westminster Bridge--I've been thinking of building myself a little place there, just a humble, unpretentious home, where I could run down for the weekend and entertain a friend or two in a quiet way, and perhaps live some part of the year. Hitherto I've rented places as I wanted 'em--old family seats and ancestral mansions and so forth: very nice in their way, but I want to feel under a roof of my own. I want to surround myself with the simple comforts, the--ah--unassuming elegance of an English country home. And you're the man--I feel more convinced of it with every word you say--you're the man to do the job in style--ah--to execute the work as it should be done."" Here was the long-wished-for client at last! And it was satisfactory to feel that he had arrived in the most ordinary and commonplace course, for no one could look at Mr. Samuel Wackerbath and believe for a moment that he was capable of floating through an upper window; he was not in the least that kind of person. ""I shall be happy to do my best,"" said Horace, with a calmness that surprised himself. ""Could you give me some idea of the amount you are prepared to spend?"" ""Well, I'm no Croesus--though I won't say I'm a pauper precisely--and, as I remarked before, I prefer comfort to splendour. I don't think I should be justified in going beyond--well, say sixty thousand."" ""Sixty thousand!"" exclaimed Horace, who had expected about a tenth of that sum. ""Oh, not _more_ than sixty thousand? I see."" ""I mean, on the house itself,"" explained Mr. Wackerbath; ""there will be outbuildings, lodges, cottages, and so forth, and then some of the rooms I should want specially decorated. Altogether, before we are finished, it may work out at about a hundred thousand. I take it that, with such a margin, you could--ah--run me up something that in a modest way would take the shine out of--I mean to say eclipse--anything in the adjoining counties?"" ""I certainly think,"" said Horace, ""that for such a sum as that I can undertake that you shall have a home which will satisfy you."" And he proceeded to put the usual questions as to site, soil, available building materials, the accommodation that would be required, and so on. ""You're young, sir,"" said Mr. Wackerbath, at the end of the interview, ""but I perceive you are up to all the tricks of the--I _should_ say, versed in the _minutiæ_ of your profession. You would like to run down and look at the ground, eh? Well, that's only reasonable; and my wife and daughters will want to have _their_ say in the matter--no getting on without pleasing the ladies, hey? Now, let me see. To-morrow's Sunday. Why not come down by the 8.45 a.m. to Lipsfield? I'll have a trap, or a brougham and pair, or something, waiting for you--take you over the ground myself, bring you back to lunch with us at Oriel Court, and talk the whole thing thoroughly over. Then we'll send you up to town in the evening, and you can start work the first thing on Monday. That suit you? Very well, then. We'll expect you to-morrow."" With this Mr. Wackerbath departed, leaving Horace, as may be imagined, absolutely overwhelmed by the suddenness and completeness of his good fortune. He was no longer one of the unemployed: he had work to do, and, better still, work that would interest him, give him all the scope and opportunity he could wish for. With a client who seemed tractable, and to whom money was clearly no object, he might carry out some of his most ambitious ideas. Moreover, he would now be in a position to speak to Sylvia's father without fear of a repulse. His commission on £60,000 would be £3,000, and that on the decorations and other work at least as much again--probably more. In a year he could marry without imprudence; in two or three years he might be making a handsome income, for he felt confident that, with such a start, he would soon have as much work as he could undertake.

"He was ashamed of himself for ever having lost heart. What were the last few years of weary waiting but probation and preparation for this splendid chance, which had come just when he really needed it, and in the most simple and natural manner? He loyally completed the work he had promised to do for Beevor, who would have to dispense with his assistance in future, and then he felt too excited and restless to stay in the office, and, after lunching at his club as usual, he promised himself the pleasure of going to Cottesmore Gardens and telling Sylvia his good news. It was still early, and he walked the whole way, as some vent for his high spirits, enjoying everything with a new zest--the dappled grey and salmon sky before him, the amber, russet, and yellow of the scanty foliage in Kensington Gardens, the pungent scent of fallen chestnuts and acorns and burning leaves, the blue-grey mist stealing between the distant tree-trunks, and then the cheery bustle and brilliancy of the High Street. Finally came the joy of finding Sylvia all alone, and witnessing her frank delight at what he had come to tell her, of feeling her hands on his shoulders, and holding her in his arms, as their lips met for the first time. If on that Saturday afternoon there was a happier man than Horace Ventimore, he would have done well to dissemble his felicity, for fear of incurring the jealousy of the high gods. When Mrs. Futvoye returned, as she did only too soon, to find her daughter and Horace seated on the same sofa, she did not pretend to be gratified. ""This is taking a most unfair advantage of what I was weak enough to say last night, Mr. Ventimore,"" she began. ""I thought I could have trusted you!"" ""I shouldn't have come so soon,"" he said, ""if my position were what it was only yesterday. But it's changed since then, and I venture to hope that even the Professor won't object now to our being regularly engaged."" And he told her of the sudden alteration in his prospects. ""Well,"" said Mrs. Futvoye, ""you had better speak to my husband about it."" The Professor came in shortly afterwards, and Horace immediately requested a few minutes' conversation with him in the study, which was readily granted. The study to which the Professor led the way was built out at the back of the house, and crowded with Oriental curios of every age and kind; the furniture had been made by Cairene cabinet-makers, and along the cornices of the book-cases were texts from the Koran, while every chair bore the Arabic for ""Welcome"" in a gilded firework on its leather back; the lamp was a perforated mosque lantern with long pendent glass tubes like hyacinth glasses; a mummy-case smiled from a corner with laboured _bonhomie_. ""Well,"" began the Professor, as soon as they were seated, ""so I was not mistaken--there was something in the brass bottle after all, then? Let's have a look at it, whatever it is."" For the moment Horace had almost forgotten the bottle. ""Oh!"" he said, ""I--I got it open; but there was nothing in it."" ""Just as I anticipated, sir,"" said the Professor. ""I told you there couldn't be anything in a bottle of that description; it was simply throwing money away to buy it."" ""I dare say it was, but I wished to speak to you on a much more important matter;"" and Horace briefly explained his object. ""Dear me,"" said the Professor, rubbing up his hair irritably, ""dear me! I'd no idea of this--no idea at all. I was under the impression that you volunteered to act as escort to my wife and daughter at St. Luc purely out of good nature to relieve me from what--to a man of my habits in that extreme heat--would have been an arduous and distasteful duty."" ""I was not wholly unselfish, I admit,"" said Horace. ""I fell in love with your daughter, sir, the first day I met her--only I felt I had no right, as a poor man with no prospects, to speak to her or you at that time."" ""A very creditable feeling--but I've yet to learn why you should have overcome it."" So, for the third time, Ventimore told the story of the sudden turn in his fortunes. ""I know this Mr. Samuel Wackerbath by name,"" said the Professor; ""one of the chief partners in the firm of Akers and Coverdale, the great estate agents--a most influential man, if you can only succeed in satisfying him."" ""Oh, I don't feel any misgivings about that, sir,"" said Horace. ""I mean to build him a house that will be beyond his wildest expectations, and you see that in a year I shall have earned several thousands, and I need not say that I will make any settlement you think proper when I marry----"" ""When you are in possession of those thousands,"" remarked the Professor, dryly, ""it will be time enough to talk of marrying and making settlements. Meanwhile, if you and Sylvia choose to consider yourselves engaged, I won't object--only I must insist on having your promise that you won't persuade her to marry you without her mother's and my consent."" Ventimore gave this undertaking willingly enough, and they returned to the drawing-room. Mrs. Futvoye could hardly avoid asking Horace, in his new character of _fiancé_, to stay and dine, which it need not be said he was only too delighted to do. ""There is one thing, my dear--er--Horace,"" said the Professor, solemnly, after dinner, when the neat parlourmaid had left them at dessert, ""one thing on which I think it my duty to caution you. If you are to justify the confidence we have shown in sanctioning your engagement to Sylvia, you must curb this propensity of yours to needless extravagance."" ""Papa!"" cried Sylvia. ""What _could_ have made you think Horace extravagant?"" ""Really,"" said Horace, ""I shouldn't have called myself particularly so."" ""Nobody ever _does_ call himself particularly extravagant,"" retorted the Professor; ""but I observed at St. Luc that you habitually gave fifty centimes as a _pourboire_ when twopence, or even a penny, would have been handsome. And no one with any regard for the value of money would have given a guinea for a worthless brass vessel on the bare chance that it might contain manuscripts, which (as any one could have foreseen) it did not."" ""But it's not a bad sort of bottle, sir,"" pleaded Horace. ""If you remember, you said yourself the shape was unusual. Why shouldn't it be worth all the money, and more?"" ""To a collector, perhaps,"" said the Professor, with his wonted amiability, ""which you are not. No, I can only call it a senseless and reprehensible waste of money."" ""Well, the truth is,"" said Horace, ""I bought it with some idea that it might interest _you_."" ""Then you were mistaken, sir. It does _not_ interest me. Why should I be interested in a metal jar which, for anything that appears to the contrary, may have been cast the other day at Birmingham?"" ""But there _is_ something,"" said Horace; ""a seal or inscription of some sort engraved on the cap. Didn't I mention it?"" ""You said nothing about an inscription before,"" replied the Professor, with rather more interest. ""What is the character--Arabic? Persian? Kufic?"" ""I really couldn't say--it's almost rubbed out--queer little triangular marks, something like birds' footprints."" ""That sounds like Cuneiform,"" said the Professor, ""which would seem to point to a Phoenician origin. And, as I am acquainted with no Oriental brass earlier than the ninth century of our era, I should regard your description as, _à priori_, distinctly unlikely. However, I should certainly like to have an opportunity of examining the bottle for myself some day.""
