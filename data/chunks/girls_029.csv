"CHAPTER 29. HESTER'S FORGOTTEN BOOK. It wanted scarcely three weeks to the holidays, and therefore scarcely three weeks to that auspicious day when Lavender House was to be the scene of one long triumph, and was to be the happy spot selected for a Midsummer holiday, accompanied by all that could make a holiday perfect--for youth and health would be there, and even the unsuccessful competitors for the great prizes would not have too sore hearts, for they would know that on the next day they were going home.  Each girl who had done her best would have a word of commendation, and only those who were very naughty, or very stubborn, could resist the all-potent elixir of happiness which would be poured out so abundantly for Mrs Willis's pupils on this day. Now that the time was drawing so near, those girls who were working for prizes found themselves fully occupied from morning to night.  In play-hours even, girls would be seen with their heads bent over their books, and, between the prizes and the acting, no little bees in any hive could be more constantly employed than were these young girls just now. No happiness is, after all, to be compared to the happiness of healthful occupation.  Busy people have no time to fret and no time to grumble. According to our old friend, Dr Watts, people who are healthily busy have also no time to be naughty, for the old doctor says that it is for idle hands that mischief is prepared. Be that as it may, and there is great truth in it, some naughty sprites, some bad fairies, were flitting around and about that apparently peaceful atmosphere.  That sunny home, governed by all that was sweet and good, was not without its serpent. Of all the prizes which attracted interest and aroused competition, the prize for English composition was this year the most popular.  In the first place, this was known to be Mrs Willis's own favourite subject. She had a great wish that her girls should write intelligibly--she had a greater wish that, if possible, they should think. ""Never was there so much written and printed,"" she was often heard to say; ""but can anyone show me a book with thoughts in it?  Can anyone show me, unless as a rare exception, a book which will live?  Oh, yes, these books which issue from the press in thousands are, many of them, very smart, a great many of them clever, but they are thrown off too quickly.  All great things, great books amongst them, must be evolved slowly."" Then she would tell her pupils what she considered the reason of this. ""In these days,"" she would say, ""all girls are what is called highly educated.  Girls and boys alike must go in for competitive examinations, must take out diplomas, and must pass certain standards of excellence. The system is cramming from beginning to end.  There is no time for reflection.  In short, my dear girls, you swallow a great deal, but you do not digest your intellectual food."" Mrs Willis hailed with pleasure any little dawnings of real thought in her girls' prize essays.  More than once she bestowed the prize upon the essay which seemed to the girls the most crude and unfinished. ""Never mind,"" she would say, ""here is an idea--or at least half an idea. This little bit of composition is original, and not, at best, a poor imitation of Sir Walter Scott or Lord Macaulay."" Thus the girls found a strong stimulus to be their real selves in these little essays, and the best of them chose their subject and let it ferment in their brains without the aid of books, except for the more technical parts. More than one girl in the school was surprised at Dora Russell exerting herself to try for the prize essay.  She was just about to close her school career, and they could not make out why she roused herself to work for the most difficult prize, for which she would have to compete with any girl in the school who chose to make a similar attempt. Dora, however, had her own, not very high motive for making the attempt. She was a thoroughly accomplished girl, graceful in her appearance and manner; in short, just the sort of girl who would be supposed to do credit to a school.  She played with finish, and even delicacy of touch. There was certainly no soul in her music, but neither were there any wrong notes.  Her drawings were equally correct, her perspective good, her trees were real trees, and the colouring of her water-colour sketches was pure.  She spoke French extremely well, and with a correct accent, and her German also was above the average.  Nevertheless, Dora was commonplace, and those girls who knew her best spoke sarcastically, and smiled at one another when she alluded to her prize essay, and seemed confident of being the successful competitor. ""You won't like to be beaten, Dora, say, by Annie Forest,"" they would laughingly remark; whereupon Dora's calm face would slightly flush and her lips would assume a very proud curve.  If there was one thing she could not bear it was to be beaten. ""Why do you try for it, Dora?"" her class-fellows would ask; but here Dora made no reply: she kept her reason to herself. The fact was Dora, who must be a copyist to the end of the chapter, and who could never to her latest day do anything original, had determined to try for the composition prize because she happened accidentally to hear a conversation between Mrs Willis and Miss Danesbury, in which something was said about a gold locket with Mrs Willis's portrait inside. Dora instantly jumped at the conclusion that this was to be the great prize bestowed upon the successful essayist.  Delightful idea; how well the trinket would look round her smooth white throat!  Instantly she determined to try for this prize, and of course as instantly the bare idea of defeat became intolerable to her.  She went steadily and methodically to work.  With extreme care she chose her subject.  Knowing something of Mrs Willis's peculiarities, she determined that her theme should not be historical; she believed that she could express herself freely and with power if only she could secure an un-hackneyed subject. Suddenly an idea which she considered brilliant occurred to her.  She would call her composition ""The River.""  This should not bear reference to Father Thames, or any other special river of England, but it should trace the windings of some fabled stream of Dora's imagination, which, as it flowed along, should tell something of the story of the many places by which it passed.  Dora was charmed with her own thought, and worked hard, evening after evening, at her subject, covering sheets of manuscript paper with pencilled jottings, and arranging and rearranging her somewhat confused thoughts.  She greatly admired a perfectly rounded period, and she was most particular as to the style in which she wrote. For the purpose of improving her style she even studied old volumes of Addison's _Spectator_; but after a time she gave up this course of study, for she found it so difficult to mould her English to Addison's that she came to the comfortable conclusion that Addison was decidedly obsolete, and that if she wished to do full justice to ""The River"" she must trust to her own unaided genius.
