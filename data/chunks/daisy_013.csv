"                      “It hath do me mochil woe.”       “Yea hath it?  Use,” quod he, “this medicine;       Every daie this Maie or that thou dine,       Go lokin in upon the freshe daisie,       And though thou be for woe in poinct to die,       That shall full gretly lessen thee of thy pine.”                                                     CHAUCER.  That night Norman started from, what was not so much sleep, as a trance of oppression and suffering, and beheld his father’s face watching him attentively. “Papa! What’s the matter?” said he, starting up. “Is any one ill?” “No; no one, lie down again,” said Dr. May, possessing himself of a hand, with a burning spot in the palm, and a throbbing pulse. “But what made you come here? Have I disturbed any one? Have I been talking?” “Only mumbling a little, but you looked very uncomfortable.” “But I’m not ill--what are you feeling my pulse for?” said Norman uneasily. “To see whether that restless sleep has quickened it.” Norman scarcely let his father count for a moment, before he asked, “What o’clock is it?” “A little after twelve.” “What does make you stay up so late, papa?” “I often do when my arm seems likely to keep me awake. Richard has done all I want.” “Pray don’t stay here in the cold,” said Norman, with feverish impatience, as he turned upwards the cool side of his pillow. “Good-night!” “No hurry,” said his father, still watching him. “There’s nothing the matter,” repeated the boy. “Do you often have such unquiet nights?” “Oh, it does not signify. Good-night,” and he tried to look settled and comfortable. “Norman,” said his father, in a voice betraying much grief, “it will not do to go on in this way. If your mother was here, you would not close yourself against her.” Norman interrupted him in a voice strangled with sobs: “It is no good saying it--I thought it would only make it worse for you; but that’s it. I cannot bear the being without her.” Dr. May was glad to see that a gush of tears followed this exclamation, as Norman hid his face under the coverings. “My poor boy,” said he, hardly able to speak, “only One can comfort you truly; but you must not turn from me; you must let me do what I can for you, though it is not the same.” “I thought it would grieve you more,” said Norman, turning his face towards him again. “What, to find my children, feeling with me, and knowing what they have lost? Surely not, Norman.” “And it is of no use,” added Norman, hiding his face again, “no one can comfort--” “There you are wrong,” said Dr. May, with deep feeling, “there is much comfort in everything, in everybody, in kindness, in all around, if one can only open one’s mind to it. But I did not come to keep you awake with such talk: I saw you were not quite well, so I came up to see about you; and now, Norman, you will not refuse to own that something is the matter.” “I did not know it,” said Norman, “I really believe I am well, if I could get rid of these horrible nights. I either lie awake, tumbling and tossing, or I get all sorts of unbearable dreams.” “Ay, when I asked master Harry about you, all the answer I could get was, that he was quite used to it, and did not mind it at all. As if I asked for his sake! How fast that boy sleeps--he is fit for a midshipman’s berth!” “But do you think there is anything amiss with me?” “I shall know more about that to-morrow morning. Come to my room as soon as you are up, unless I come to you. Now, I have something to read before I go to bed, and I may as well try if it will put you to sleep.” Norman’s last sight that night was of the outline of his father’s profile, and he was scarcely awake the next morning before Dr. May was there again. Unwilling as he had been to give way, it was a relief to relinquish the struggle to think himself well, and to venture to lounge and dawdle, rest his heavy head, and stretch his inert limbs without fear of remark. His father found him after breakfast lying on the sofa in the drawing-room with a Greek play by his side, telling Ethel what words to look out. “At it again!” exclaimed Dr. May. “Carry it away, Ethel. I will have no Latin or Greek touched these holidays.” “You know,” said Norman, “if I don’t sap, I shall have no chance of keeping up.” “You’ll keep nowhere if you don’t rest.” “It is only Euripides, and I can’t do anything else,” said Norman languidly. “Very likely, I don’t care. You have to get well first of all, and the Greek will take care of itself. Go up to Margaret. I put you in her keeping, while I am gone to Whitford. After that, I dare say Richard will be very glad to have a holiday, and let you drive me to Abbotstoke.” Norman rose, and wearily walked upstairs, while his sister lingered to excuse herself. “Papa, I did not think Euripides would hurt him--he knows it all so well, and he said he could not read anything else.” “Just so, Ethel. Poor fellow, he has not spirits or energy for anything: his mind was forced into those classicalities when it wanted rest, and now it has not spring enough to turn back again.” “Do you think him so very ill?” “Not exactly, but there’s low fever hanging about him, and we must look after him well, and I hope we may get him right. I have told Margaret about him; I can’t stop any longer now.” Norman found the baby in his sister’s room, and this was just what suited him. The Daisy showed a marked preference for her brothers; and to find her so merry and good with him, pleased and flattered him far more than his victory at school. He carried her about, danced her, whistled to her, and made her admire her pretty blue eyes in the glass most successfully, till nurse carried her off. But perhaps he had been sent up rather too soon, for as he sat in the great chair by the fire, he was teased by the constant coming and going, all the petty cares of a large household transacted by Margaret--orders to butcher and cook--Harry racing in to ask to take Tom to the river--Tom, who was to go when his lesson was done, coming perpetually to try to repeat the same unhappy bit of ‘As in Proesenti’, each time in a worse whine. “How can you bear it, Margaret?” said Norman, as she finally dismissed Tom, and laid down her account-book, taking up some delicate fancy work. “Mercy, here’s another,” as enter a message about lamp oil, in the midst of which Mary burst in to beg Margaret to get Miss Winter to let her go to the river with Harry and Tom. “No, indeed, Mary, I could not think of such a thing. You had better go back to your lessons, and don’t be silly,” as she looked much disposed to cry. “No one but a Tom-boy would dream of it,” added Norman; and Mary departed disconsolate, while Margaret gave a sigh of weariness, and said, as she returned to her work, “There, I believe I have done. I hope I was not cross with poor Mary, but it was rather too much to ask.” “I can’t think how you can help being cross to every one,” said Norman, as he took away the books she had done with. “I am afraid I am,” said Margaret sadly. “It does get trying at times.” “I should think so! This eternal worrying must be more than any one can bear, always lying there too.” “It is only now and then that it grows tiresome,” said Margaret. “I am too happy to be of some use, and it is too bad to repine, but sometimes a feeling comes of its being always the same, as if a little change would be such a treat.” “Aren’t you very tired of lying in bed?” “Yes, very, sometimes. I fancy, but it is only fancy, that I could move better if I was up and dressed. It has seemed more so lately, since I have been stronger.” “When do you think they will let you get up?” “There’s the question. I believe papa thinks I might be lifted to the sofa now--and oh! how I long for it--but then Mr. Ward does not approve of my sitting up, even as I am doing now, and wants to keep me flat. Papa thinks that of no use, and likely to hurt my general health, and I believe the end of it will be that he will ask Sir Matthew Fleet’s opinion.” ",mochil woe use medicine daie dine freshe daisie woe poinct die less pine night start much sleep trance oppression suffering beheld father face watch matter start one ill lie possess hand burning spot palm throbb pulse disturb one talk mumble uncomfortable ill feel pulse restless sleep quicken let father count moment ask  stay late papa arm seem likely keep want pray stay cold feverish impatience turn cool side pillow night hurry father watch matter repeat boy such unquiet night signify night try settle comfortable father voice betray much grief way mother close interrupt voice strangle sob bad bear glad gush tear follow exclamation hide face covering poor boy able speak comfort turn let same grieve more turn face find child feel lose use add hide face comfort wrong deep feeling much comfort kindness open mind keep such talk refuse own matter believe well rid horrible night lie awake tumble toss sort unbearable dream ask master answer use mind ask sake boy sleep fit midshipman berth amiss more morning room read bed try put sleep last sight night outline father profile awake next morning unwill give way relief relinquish struggle venture lounge dawdle rest heavy head stretch inert limb fear remark father find breakfast lie sofa draw room greek play side word exclaim carry touch holiday sap chance keep keep rest else likely care first care put keeping gone glad holiday let drive rise walk sister linger excuse hurt read else poor fellow spirit energy mind force classicality want rest spring turn ill low fever hang hope right stop find baby sister room suit show mark preference brother find merry pleased flatter more victory school carry dance whistle admire pretty blue eye glass nurse carry send sit great chair fire tease constant petty care large household transact order butcher cook racing ask river lesson try repeat same unhappy bit time bad whine bear dismiss lay account book delicate fancy work enter message lamp oil midst burst beg let river thing lesson silly dispose cry boy dream add depart disconsolate give sigh weariness return work believe hope cross poor much ask help cross one book afraid try time eternal worry more one bear lie grow tiresome happy use bad repine feeling same change treat tired lie bed fancy fancy move dress seem strong let question believe papa lift sofa approve sitting want keep flat use likely hurt general health believe end ask opinion 
"“Is that the man he calls Mat?” “Yes, you know they went through the university together, and were at Edinburgh and Paris, but they have never met since he set up in London, and grew so famous. I believe it would be a great treat to papa to have him, and it would be a good thing for papa too; I don’t think his arm is going on right--he does not trust to Mr. Ward’s treatment, and I am sure some one else ought to see it.” “Did you know, Margaret, that he sits up quite late, because he cannot sleep for it?” “Yes, I hear him moving about, but don’t tell him so; I would not have him guess for the world, that it kept me awake.” “Why, if I think he is awake and in pain I cannot settle myself to sleep; but that is no matter; having no exercise, of course I don’t sleep so much. But I am very anxious about him--he looks so thin, and gets so fagged--and no wonder.” “Ah! Mr. Everard told me he was quite shocked to see him, and would hardly have known him,” and Norman groaned from the bottom of his heart. “Well, I shall hope much from Sir Matthew’s taking him in hand,” said Margaret cheerfully; “he will mind him, though he will not Mr. Ward.” “I wish the holidays were over!” said Norman, with a yawn, as expressive as a sigh. “That’s not civil, on the third day,” said Margaret, smiling, “when I am so glad to have you to look after me, so as to set Flora at liberty.” “What, can I do you any good?” said Norman, with a shade of his former alacrity. “To be sure you can, a great deal. Better not come near me otherwise, for I make every one into a slave. I want my morning reading now--that book on Advent, there.” “Shall I read it to you?” “Thank you, that’s nice, and I shall get on with baby’s frock.” Norman read, but, ere long, took to yawning; Margaret begged for the book, which he willingly resigned, saying, however, that he liked it, only he was stupid. She read on aloud, till she heard a succession of heavy breathings, and saw him fast asleep, and so he continued till waked by his father’s coming home. Richard and Ethel were glad of a walk, for Margaret had found them a pleasant errand. Their Cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner between service and afternoon school, and Margaret had desired the cook to serve them up some broth in the back kitchen, to which the brother and sister were now to invite them. Mary was allowed to take her boots to Rebekah Watts, since Margaret held that goodness had better be profitable, at least at the outset; and Harry and Tom joined the party. Norman, meantime, was driving his father--a holiday preferment highly valued in the days when Dr. May used only to assume the reins, when his spirited horses showed too much consciousness that they had a young hand over them, or when the old hack took a fit of laziness. Now, Norman needed Richard’s assurance that the bay was steady, so far was he from being troubled with his ancient desire, that the steed would rear right up on his hind legs. He could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town, and found himself master of the animal, and even then the words were few, and chiefly spoken by Dr. May, until after going along about three miles of the turnpike road, he desired Norman to turn down a cross-country lane. “Where does this lead?” “It comes out at Abbotstoke, but I have to go to an outlying farm.” “Papa,” said Norman, after a few minutes, “I wish you would let me do my Greek.” “Is that what you have been pondering all this time? What, may not the bonus Homerus slumber sometimes?” “It is not Homer, it is Euripides. I do assure you, papa, it is no trouble, and I get much worse without it.” “Well, stop here, the road grows so bad that we will walk, and let the boy lead the horse to meet us at Woodcote.” Norman followed his father down a steep narrow lane, little better than a stony water-course, and began to repeat, “If you would but let me do my work! I’ve got nothing else to do, and now they have put me up, I should not like not to keep my place.” “Very likely, but--hollo--how swelled this is!” said Dr. May, as they came to the bottom of the valley, where a stream rushed along, coloured with a turbid creamy yellow, making little whirlpools where it crossed the road, and brawling loudly just above where it roared and foamed between two steep banks of rock, crossed by a foot-bridge of planks, guarded by a handrail of rough poles. The doctor had traversed it, and gone a few paces beyond, when, looking back, he saw Norman very pale, with one foot on the plank, and one hand grasping the rail. He came back, and held out his hand, which Norman gladly caught at, but no sooner was the other side attained, than the boy, though he gasped with relief, exclaimed, “This is too bad! Wait one moment, please, and let me go back.” He tried, but the first touch of the shaking rail, and glance at the chasm, disconcerted him, and his father, seeing his white cheeks and rigid lips, said, “Stop, Norman, don’t try it. You are not fit,” he added, as the boy came to him reluctantly. “I can’t bear to be such a wretch!” said he. “I never used to be. I will not--let me conquer it;” and he was turning back, but the doctor took his arm, saying decidedly, “No, I won’t have it done. You are only making it worse by putting a force on yourself.” But the farther Norman was from the bridge, the more displeased he was with himself, and more anxious to dare it again. “There’s no bearing it,” he muttered; “let me only run back. I’ll overtake you. I must do it if no one looks on.” “No such thing,” said the doctor, holding him fast. “If you do, you’ll have it all over again at night.” “That’s better than to know I am worse than Tom.” “I tell you, Norman, it is no such thing. You will recover your tone if you will only do as you are told, but your nerves have had a severe shock, and when you force yourself in this way, you only increase the mischief.” “Nerves,” muttered Norman disdainfully. “I thought they were only fit for fine ladies.” Dr. May smiled. “Well, will it content you if I promise that as soon as I see fit, I’ll bring you here, and let you march over that bridge as often as you like?” “I suppose I must be contented, but I don’t like to feel like a fool.” “You need not, while the moral determination is sound.” “But my Greek, papa.” “At it again--I declare, Norman, you are the worst patient I ever had!” Norman made no answer, and Dr. May presently said, “Well, let me hear what you have to say about it. I assure you it is not that I don’t want you to get on, but that I see you are in great need of rest.” “Thank you, papa. I know you mean it for my good, but I don’t think you do know how horrid it is. I have got nothing on earth to do or care for--the school work comes quite easy to me, and I’m sure thinking is worse; and then”--Norman spoke vehemently--“now they have put me up, it will never do to be beaten, and all the four others ought to be able to do it. I did not want or expect to be dux, but now I am, you could not bear me not to keep my place, and to miss the Randall scholarship, as I certainly shall, if I do not work these whole holidays.” “Norman, I know it,” said his father kindly. “I am very sorry for you, and I know I am asking of you what I could not have done at your age--indeed, I don’t believe I could have done it for you a few months ago. It is my fault that you have been let alone, to have an overstrain and pressure on your mind, when you were not fit for it, and I cannot see any remedy but complete freedom from work. At the same time, if you fret and harass yourself about being surpassed, that is, as you say, much worse for you than Latin and Greek. Perhaps I may be wrong, and study might not do you the harm I think it would; at any rate, it is better than tormenting yourself about next half year, so I will not positively forbid it, but I think you had much better let it alone. I don’t want to make it a matter of duty. I only tell you this, that you may set your mind at rest as far as I am concerned. If you do lose your place, I will consider it as my own doing, and not be disappointed. I had rather see you a healthy, vigorous, useful man, than a poor puling nervous wretch of a scholar, if you were to get all the prizes in the university.” ",man call university meet set grow famous believe great treat papa thing papa arm trust treatment sure one else sit sleep hear move guess world keep awake pain settle sleep matter exercise course sleep anxious thin fagged wonder shocked groan bottom heart hope much hand mind wish holiday yawn expressive sigh civil third day smile glad set liberty shade former alacrity sure great deal one slave want morning reading book read thank nice baby frock read yawning begg book resign like stupid read hear succession heavy breathing asleep continue wake father glad walk find pleasant errand child dinner service afternoon school desire cook serve broth back kitchen brother sister invite allow boot hold goodness profitable least outset join party drive father holiday preferment value day use assume rein spirit horse show much consciousness young hand old hack fit laziness need assurance bay steady trouble ancient desire steed rear hind leg talk listen clear town find master animal word few speak mile road desire turn lane lead outly farm few minute wish let ponder time bonus slumber assure papa trouble bad stop road grow bad walk let boy lead horse meet follow father steep narrow lane stony water course begin repeat let work else put like keep place likely swell bottom valley stream rush coloured turbid creamy yellow whirlpool cross road brawl roar foam steep bank rock cross foot bridge plank guard handrail rough pole doctor travers few pace pale foot plank hand grasp rail hold hand catch other side attain boy gasp relief exclaim bad wait moment let try first touch shaking rail glance chasm disconcert father white cheek rigid lip stop try fit add boy bear wretch use let conquer turn doctor arm bad put force far bridge displease anxious dare bear mutter let run overtake such thing doctor hold night bad such thing recover tone nerve severe shock force way increase mischief nerve mutter fit fine lady smile content promise fit bring let march bridge like suppose content like feel fool need moral determination sound greek declare bad patient answer let hear assure want great need rest thank mean horrid earth care school work easy sure thinking bad speak put beat other able want expect dux bear keep place miss scholarship work whole holiday father sorry ask age believe few month fault let alone overstrain pressure mind fit remedy complete freedom work same time fret harass surpass bad latin wrong study harm rate torment next half year forbid let want matter duty set mind rest concerned lose place consider own disappoint healthy vigorous useful man poor puling nervous wretch scholar prize university
