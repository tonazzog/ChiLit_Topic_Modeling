"     The heart may ache, but may not burst;      Heaven will not leave thee, nor forsake.                                      Christian Year.  Hector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning’s shooting at the Grange, Dr. May promising to meet them, and let them drive him home. Meta was out when he arrived; and, repairing to the library, he found Mr. Rivers sitting by a fire, though it was early in September, with the newspaper before him, but not reading. He looked depressed, and seemed much disappointed at having heard that George and Flora had accepted some further invitations in Scotland, and did not intend to return for another month. Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had met, but failed to enliven him, and, as if trying to assign some cause for his vexation, he lamented over fogs and frosts, and began to dread an October in Scotland for Flora, almost as if it were the Arctic regions. He grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora, and speaking of the great satisfaction he had in seeing his son married to so admirable a person. He only wished it could be the same with his daughter. “You are a very unselfish father,” said Dr. May. “I cannot imagine you without your little fairy.” “It would be hard to part,” said Mr. Rivers, sighing; “yet I should be relieved to see her in good hands, so pretty and engaging as she is, and something of an heiress. With our dear Flora, she is secure of a happy home when I am gone, but still I should be glad to have seen--” and he broke off thoughtfully. “She is so sensible, that we shall see her make a good choice,” said Dr. May, smiling; “that is, if she choose at all, for I do not know who is worthy of her.” “I am quite indifferent as to fortune,” continued Mr. Rivers. “She will have enough of her own.” “Enough not to be dependent, which is the point,” said Dr. May, “though I should have few fears for her any way.” “It would be a comfort,” harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the subject, as if he wanted to say something, “if she were only safe with a man who knew how to value her and make her happy. Such a young man as your Norman, now--I have often thought--” Dr. May would not seem to hear, but he could not prevent himself from blushing as crimson as if he had been the very Norman, as he answered, going on with his own speech, as if Mr. Rivers’s had been unmade, “She is the brightest little creature under the sun, and the sparkle is down so deep within, that however it may turn out, I should never fear for her happiness.” “Flora is my great reliance,” proceeded Mr. Rivers. “Her aunt, Lady Leonora, is very kind, but somehow she does not seem to suit with Meta.” “Oh, ho,” thought the doctor, “have you made that discovery, my good friend?” The voices of the two boys were heard in the hall, explaining their achievements to Meta, and Dr. May took his departure, Hector driving him, and embarking in a long discourse on his own affairs as if he had quite forgotten that the doctor was not his father, and going on emphatically, in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor, who, at Dr. Spencer’s door, exclaimed, “Stop, Hector, let me out here--thank you;” and presently brought out his friend into the garden, and sat down on the grass, talking low and earnestly over the disease with which Mr. Rivers had been so long affected; for though Dr. May could not perceive any positively unfavourable symptom, he had been rendered vaguely uneasy by the unusual heaviness and depression of manner. So long did they sit conversing, that Blanche was sent out, primed with an impertinent message, that two such old doctors ought to be ashamed of themselves for sitting so late in the dew. Dr. Spencer was dragged in to drink tea, and the meal had just been merrily concluded, when the door bell rang, and a message was brought in. “The carriage from the Grange, sir; Miss Rivers would be much obliged if you would come directly.” “There!” said Dr. May, looking at Dr. Spencer, as if to say, I told you so, in the first triumph of professional sagacity; but the next moment exclaiming, “Poor little Meta!” he hurried away. A gloom fell on those who remained, for, besides their sympathy for Meta, and their liking for her kind old father, there was that one unacknowledged heartache, which, though in general bravely combated, lay in wait always ready to prey on them. Hector stole round to sit by Margaret, and Dr. Spencer muttered, “This will never do,” and sent Tom to fetch some papers lying on his table, whence he read them some curious accounts that he had just received from his missionary friends in India. They were interested, but in a listening mood, that caused a universal start when the bell again sounded. This time, James reported that the servant from the Grange said his master was very ill--he had brought a letter to post for Mr. George Rivers, and here was a note for Miss Ethel. It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father, and contained these few words:  “DEAR E.--, “I believe this attack will be the last. Come to Meta, and bring my things.                                        R. M.”  Ethel put her hands to her forehead. It was as if she had been again plunged into the stunned dream of misery of four years ago, and her sensation was of equal bewilderment and uselessness; but it was but for a moment--the next she was in a state of over-bustle and eagerness. She wanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta, and could hardly obey the word and gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side. “Dear Ethel, you must calm yourself, or you will not be of use.” “I? I can’t be of any use! Oh, if you could go! If Flora were but here! But I must go, Margaret.” “I will put up your father’s things,” said Dr. Spencer, in a soothing tone. “The carriage cannot be ready in a moment, so that there will be full time.” Mary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel’s own goods, which she would otherwise have forgotten; and Margaret, meanwhile, detained her by her side, trying to calm and encourage her with gentle words of counsel, that might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that had seized her, and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless. Adams was to drive her thither in the gig, and it presently came to the door. Dr. Spencer wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls, and spoke words of kindly cheer in her ear as she set off. The fresh night air blew pleasantly on her, the stars glimmered in full glory overhead, and now and then her eye was caught by the rocket-like track of a shooting-star. Orion was rising slowly far in the east, and bringing to her mind the sailor-boy under the southern sky; if, indeed, he were not where sun and stars no more are the light. It was strange that the thought came more as soothing than as acute pain; she could bear to think of him thus in her present frame, as long as she had not to talk of him. Under those solemn stars, the life everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life, and Ethel’s agitation was calmed away. The old cedar-tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky, and the lights in the house glanced behind it. The servants looked rather surprised to see Ethel, as if she were not expected, and conducted her to the great drawing-room, which looked the more desolate and solitary, from the glare of lamplight, falling on the empty seats which Ethel had lately seen filled with a glad home party. She was looking round, thinking whether to venture up to Meta’s room, and there summon Bellairs, when Meta came gliding in, and threw her arms round her. Ethel could not speak, but Meta’s voice was more cheerful than she had expected. “How kind of you, dear Ethel!” ",heart ache burst heaven leave forsake christian finish holiday morning shooting promise meet let drive arrive repair library find sit fire newspaper read depressed seem disappointed hear accept further invitation intend return month speak hospitality kindness meet fail enlive try assign cause vexation lament fog frost begin dread arctic region grow animated prais speak great satisfaction son marry admirable person wish same daughter unselfish father imagine fairy hard part sigh relieve hand engage heiress dear secure happy home gone glad break sensible choice smile choose worthy indifferent fortune continue enough own enough dependent point few fear way comfort harp dwelling subject want safe man value happy young man seem hear prevent blush crimson very answer own speech unmade brightest creature sun sparkle deep turn fear happiness great reliance proceed aunt kind seem suit doctor discovery friend voice boy hear hall explain achievement departure drive embark long discourse own affair forget doctor father spite absence mind betray auditor door exclaim stop let thank bring friend garden sit grass talk low disease affect perceive unfavourable symptom render uneasy unusual heaviness depression manner sit convers send prime impertinent message such old doctor ashamed sit dew drag drink tea meal conclude door bell ring message bring carriage sir oblige first triumph professional sagacity next moment exclaim poor meta hurry gloom fall remain sympathy like kind old father unacknowledged heartache general combate lay wait ready prey steal sit mutter send fetch paper lie table read curious account receive missionary friend interested listening mood cause universal start bell sound time report servant master ill bring letter post note only note receive father contain few word dear believe attack last bring thing put hand forehead plunge stunn dream misery year sensation equal bewilderment uselessness moment next state bustle eagerness want fly hast help obey word gesture summon side dear calm use use put father thing soothing tone carriage ready moment full time prepare own goods forget detain side try calm encourage gentle word counsel hinder give way flurry emotion seize prevent certain useless drive gig door wrap cloak shawl speak word kindly cheer ear set fresh night air blow star glimmer full glory eye catch rocket like track shooting star rise east bring mind sailor boy southern sky sun star more light strange thought soothing acute pain bear present frame talk solemn star life everlasting seem overpower sense mortal life agitation calm old cedar tree stand stately blackness sky light house glance servant surprised expect conduct great draw room desolate solitary glare lamplight fall empty seat fill glad home party venture room summon glide throw arm speak voice cheerful expect kind dear 
"“Papa sent for me,” said Ethel. “He is so kind! Can Margaret spare you?” “Oh, yes; but you must leave me. You must want to be with him.” “He never lets me come in when he has these attacks,” said Meta. “If he only would! But will you come up to my room? That is nearer.” “Is papa with him?” Meta wound her arms round Ethel, and led her up to her sitting-room, where a book lay on the table. She said that her father had seemed weary and torpid, and had sat still until almost their late dinner-hour, when he seemed to bethink himself of dressing, and had risen. She thought he walked weakly, and rather tottering, and had run to make him lean on her, which he did, as far as his own room door. There he had kissed her, and thanked her, and murmured a word like blessing. She had not, however, been alarmed, until his servant had come to tell her that he had another seizure. Ethel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her father. She had; but Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in the extent of his fears. She had become so far accustomed to these attacks, that, though anxious and distressed, she did not apprehend more than a few days’ weakness, and her chief longing was to be of use. She was speaking cheerfully of beginning her nursing to-morrow, and of her great desire that her papa would allow her to sit up with him, when there was a slow, reluctant movement of the lock of the door, and the two girls sprang to their feet, as Dr. May opened it; and Ethel read his countenance at once. Not so Meta. “How is he? May I go to him?” cried she. “Not now, my dear,” said Dr. May, putting his hand on her shoulder, in a gentle, detaining manner, that sent a thrill of trembling through her frame, though she did not otherwise move. She only clasped her hands together, and looked up into his face. He answered the look. “Yes, my dear, the struggle is over.” Ethel came near, and put her arm round Meta’s waist, as if to strengthen her, as she stood quite passive and still. Dr. May seemed to think it best that all should be told; but, though intently watching Meta, he directed his words to his own daughter. “Thank Heaven, it has been shorter, and less painful, than I had dared to hope.” Meta tried to speak, but could not bring out the words, and, with an imploring look at Ethel, as if to beg her to make them clear for her, she inarticulately murmured, “Oh! why did you not call me?” “I could not. He would not let me. His last conscious word to me was not to let you see him suffer.” Meta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish. Dr. May signed to Ethel to guide her back to the sofa, but the movement seemed so far to rouse her, that she said, “I should like to go to bed.” “Right--the best thing,” said Dr. May; and he whispered to Ethel, “Go with her, but don’t try to rouse her--don’t talk to her. Come back to me, presently.” He did not even shake hands with Meta, nor wish her good-night, as she disappeared into her own room. Bellairs undressed her, and Ethel stood watching, till the young head, under the load of sorrow, so new to it, was laid on the pillow. Bellairs asked her if she would have a light. “No, no, thank you--the dark and alone. Good-night,” said Meta. Ethel went back to the sitting-room, where her father was standing at the window, looking out into the night. He turned as she came in, folded her in his arms, and kissed her forehead. “And how is the poor little dear?”  he asked. “The same,” said Ethel. “I can’t bear to leave her alone, and to have said nothing to comfort her.” “It is too soon as yet,” said Dr. May--“her mind has not taken it in. I hope she will sleep all night, and have more strength to look at it when she wakens.” “She was utterly unprepared.” “I could not make her understand me,” said Dr. May. “And, oh, papa, what a pity she was not there!” “It was no sight for her, till the last few minutes; and his whole mind seemed bent on sparing her. What tenderness it has been.” “Must we leave her to herself all night?” “Better so,” said Dr. May. “She has been used to loneliness; and to thrust companionship on her would be only harassing.” Ethel, who scarcely knew what it was to be alone, looked as if she did not understand. “I used to try to force consolation on people,” said Dr. May, “but I know, now, that it can only be done by following their bent.” “You have seen so many sorrows,” said Ethel. “I never understood till I felt,” said Dr. May. “Those few first days were a lesson.” “I did not think you knew what was passing,” said Ethel. “I doubt whether any part of my life is more distinctly before me than those two days,” said Dr. May. “Flora coming in and out, and poor Alan sitting by me; but I don’t believe I had any will. I could no more have moved my mind than my broken arm; and I verily think, Ethel, that, but for that merciful torpor, I should have been frantic. It taught me never to disturb grief.” “And what shall we do?” “You must stay with her till Flora comes. I will be here as much as I can. She is our charge, till they come home. I told him, between the spasms, that I had sent for you, and he seemed pleased.” “If only I were anybody else!” Dr. May again threw his arm round her, and looked into her face. He felt that he had rather have her, such as she was, than anybody else; and, together, they sat down, and talked of what was to be done, and what was best for Meta, and of the solemnity of being in the house of death. Ethel felt and showed it so much, in her subdued, awe-struck manner, that her father felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary manner, familiarised, as he necessarily was, with the like scenes. It drew him back to the thought of their own trouble, and their conversation recurred to those days, so that each gained a more full understanding of the other, and they at length separated, certainly with the more peaceful and soft feelings for being in the abode of mourning. Bellairs promised to call Ethel, to be with her young lady as early as might be, reporting that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour, so that Ethel was up, and had been with Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found her half dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast, and in going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down, nor deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her eyes looked wandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered, as if she was not sure what she was doing or saying. Ethel told her not to mind--Dr. Spencer would take care of the patients; but she did not seem to recollect, at first, who Dr. Spencer was, nor to care for being reminded. Breakfast was laid out in the little sitting-room. Ethel wanted to take the trouble off her hands, but she would not let her. She sat behind her urn, and asked about tea or coffee, quite accurately, in a low, subdued voice, that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was over, and she had rung the bell, and risen up, as if to her daily work, she turned round, with that piteous, perplexed air, and stood for a moment, as if confused. “Cannot we help you?” said Ethel. “I don’t know. Thank you. But, Dr. May, I must not keep you from other people--” “I have no one to go to this morning,” said Dr. May. “I am ready to stay with you, my dear.” Meta came closer to him, and murmured, “Thank you!” The breakfast things had, by this time, been taken away, and Meta, looking to see that the door had shut for the last time, said, in a low voice, “Now tell me--” ",send kind spare leave want let attack room nearer papa meta wind arm lead sitting room book lay table father seem weary torpid sit late dinner hour seem bethink dress rise walk totter run lean own room door kiss thank murmure word blessing alarm servant seizure ask father surprise find extent fear become accustom attack anxious distressed apprehend more few day weakness chief longing use speak begin nursing great desire papa allow sit slow reluctant movement lock door girl spring foot open read countenance cry dear put hand shoulder gentle detain manner send thrill tremble frame move clasp hand face answer dear struggle put arm waist strengthen stand passive seem watch direct word own daughter thank short painful dare hope try speak bring word implor beg clear murmure call let last conscious word let suffer meta wrung clasp hand mute anguish sign guide sofa movement seem rouse like bed right thing whisper try rouse talk shake hand wish night disappear own room undress stand watch young head load sorrow new lay pillow ask light thank dark alone night sitting room father stand window night turn fold arm kiss forehead poor dear ask same bear leave comfort mind hope sleep night more strength waken unprepared understand pity sight last few minute whole mind seem bent spare tenderness leave night use loneliness thrust companionship harass alone understand use try force consolation person follow bend many sorrow understand feel few first day lesson pass doubt part life day poor sit believe will move mind break arm merciful torpor frantic teach disturb grief  stay much charge spasm send seem pleased else throw arm face feel such else sit talk solemnity house death feel show much subdued awe strike manner father feel check about return ordinary manner familiarise like scene draw thought own trouble conversation recurr day gain full understanding other length separate peaceful soft feeling abode mourn promise call young lady report sound asleep sleep continue shield usual hour summon find half dress hasten breakfast patient elasticity constitute young mind strike deprive power thought other eye wonder word falter sure mind care patient seem recollect first care remind breakfast lay sitting room want trouble hand let sit urn ask tea coffee low subdued voice overcame meal rung bell rise daily work turn piteous perplex air stand moment confuse help thank keep other person morning ready stay dear close murmure thank breakfast thing time door shut last time low voice 
"Dr. May drew her down to sit on the sofa beside him, and, in his soft, sweet voice, told her all that she wished to learn of her father’s last hours, and was glad to see showers of quiet, wholesome tears drop freely down, but without violence, and she scarcely attempted to speak. There was a pause at the end, and then she said gently, “Thank you, for it all. Dear papa!” And she rose up, and went back to her room. “She has learned to dwell apart,” said Dr. May, much moved. “How beautiful she bears up!” said Ethel. “It has been a life which, as she has used it, has taught her strength and self-dependence in the midst of prosperity.” “Yes,” said Ethel, “she has trained herself by her dread of self-indulgence, and seeking after work. But oh! what a break up it is for her! I cannot think how she holds up. Shall I go to her?” “I think not. She knows the way to the only Comforter. I am not afraid of her after those blessed tears.” Dr. May was right; Meta presently returned to them, in the same gentle subdued sadness, enfolding her, indeed, as a flower weighed down by mist, but not crushing nor taking away her powers. It was as if she were truly upheld; and thankful to her friends as she was, she did not throw herself on them in utter dependence or self-abandonment. She wrote needful letters, shedding many tears over them, and often obliged to leave off to give the blinding weeping its course, but refusing to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr. May’s lame arm. All that was right, she strove to do; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot, and was refreshed by his reading to her; and when Dr. May desired it, she submissively put on her bonnet, and took several turns with Ethel in the shrubbery, though it made her cry heartily to look into the downstairs rooms. And she lay on the sofa at last, owning herself strangely tired, she did not know why, and glad that Ethel should read to her. By and by, she went to dress for the evening, and came back, full of the tidings that one of the children in the village had been badly burned. It occupied her very much--she made Ethel promise to go and see about her to-morrow, and sent Bellairs at once with every comfort that she could devise. On the whole, those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable time. She saw more than usual of her father, and had such conversations with him as were seldom practicable at home, and that chimed in with the unavowed care which hung on their minds; while Meta was a most sweet and loving charge, without being a burden, and often saying such beautiful things in her affectionate resignation, that Ethel could only admire and lay them up in her mind. Dr. May went backwards and forwards, and brought good accounts of Margaret and fond messages; he slept at the Grange each night, and Meta used to sit in the corner of the sofa and work, or not, as best suited her, while she listened to his talk with Ethel, and now and then herself joined. George Rivers’s absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements; but his sister dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return; and often were the posts and the journeys reckoned over, without a satisfactory conclusion, as to when he could arrive from so remote a part of Scotland. At last, as the two girls had finished their early dinner, the butler brought in word that Mr. Norman May was there. Meta at once begged that he would come in, and Ethel went into the hall to meet him. He looked very wan, with the dark rings round his eyes a deeper purple than ever, and he could hardly find utterance to ask, “How is she?” “As good and sweet as she can be,” said Ethel warmly; but no more, for Meta herself had come to the dining-room door, and was holding out her hand. Norman took it in both his, but could not speak; Meta’s own soft voice was the first. “I thought you would come--he was so fond of you.” Poor Norman quite gave way, and Meta was the one to speak gentle words of soothing. “There is so much to be thankful for,” she said. “He has been spared so much of the suffering Dr. May feared for him; and he was so happy about George.” Norman made a great effort to recover himself. Ethel asked for Flora and George. It appeared that they had been on an excursion when the first letter arrived at Glenbracken, and thus had received both together in the evening, on their return. George had been greatly overcome, and they had wished to set off instantly; but Lady Glenbracken would not hear of Flora’s travelling night and day, and it had at length been arranged that Norman Ogilvie should drive Norman across the country that evening, to catch the mail for Edinburgh, and he had been on the road ever since. George was following with his wife more slowly, and would be at home to-morrow evening. Meantime, he sent full authority to his father-in-law to make arrangements. Ethel went to see the burned child, leaving Meta to take her walk in the garden under Norman’s charge. He waited on her with a sort of distant reverence for a form of grief, so unlike what he had dreaded for her, when the first shock of the tidings had brought back to him the shattered bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur. To dwell on the details was, to her, a comfort, knowing his sympathy and the affection there had been between him and her father; nor had they parted in such absolute brightness, as to make them unprepared for such a meeting as the present. The cloud of suspense was brooding lower and lower over the May family, and the need of faith and submission was as great with them as with the young orphan herself. Norman said little, but that little was so deep and fervent, that after a time Meta could not help saying, when Ethel was seen in the distance, and their talk was nearly over, “Oh, Norman, these things are no mirage!” “It is the world that is the mirage,” he answered. Ethel came up, and Dr. May also, in good time for the post. He was obliged to become very busy, using Norman for his secretary, till he saw his son’s eyes so heavy, that he remembered the two nights that he had been up, and ordered him to go home and go to bed as soon as tea was over. “May I come back to-morrow?” “Why--yes--I think you may. No, no,” he added, recollecting himself, “I think you had better not,” and he did not relent, though Norman looked disappointed. Meta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried at the suburban church, where lay her mother; and Dr. May, having been desired to seek out the will and open it, found it was so; and fixed the day and hour with Meta, who was as submissive and reasonable as possible, though much grieved that he thought she could not be present. Ethel, after going with Meta to her room at night, returned as usual to talk matters over with him, and again say how good Meta was. “And I think Norman’s coming did her a great deal of good,” said Ethel. “Ha! yes,” said the doctor thoughtfully. “She thinks so much of Mr. Rivers having been fond of him.” “Yes,” said the doctor, “he was. I find, in glancing over the will, which was newly made on Flora’s marriage, that he has remembered Norman--left him £100 and his portfolio of prints by Raffaelle.” “Has he, indeed?--how very kind, how much Norman will value it.” “It is remarkable,” said Dr. May; and then, as if he could not help it, told Ethel what Mr. Rivers had said of his wishes with regard to his daughter. Ethel blushed and smiled, and looked so much touched and delighted, that he grew alarmed and said, “You know, Ethel, this must be as if it never had been mentioned.” ",draw sit sofa soft sweet voice wish learn father last hour glad shower quiet wholesome tear drop violence attempt speak pause end thank dear papa rise room learn dwell move beautiful bear life use teach strength self dependence midst prosperity train dread self indulgence seek work break hold way only afraid bless tear right return same gentle subdued sadness enfold flower weigh mist crush power upheld thankful friend throw utter dependence self abandonment write needful letter shed many tear oblige leave give blinding weep course refuse impose unnecessary task lame arm right strive refresh reading desire put bonnet several turn shrubbery cry downstairs room lay sofa last own tired glad read dress evening full tiding child village burn occupy promise send comfort devise whole day peaceful comfortable time more usual father such conversation practicable home chime unavowed care hang mind sweet loving charge burden such beautiful thing affectionate resignation admire lay mind forward bring account fond message sleep night use sit corner sofa work suit listen talk join absence serious inconvenience arrangement sister dread grief wish return post journey reckon satisfactory conclusion arrive remote part last girl finish early dinner butler bring word begg hall meet wan dark ring eye deep purple find utterance ask sweet more dining room door hold hand speak own soft voice first fond poor give way one speak gentle word soothing much thankful spare much suffering fear happy great effort recover ask appear excursion first letter arrive receive evening return overcome wish set hear travelling night day length arrange drive country evening catch mail road follow wife home evening send full authority father law arrangement burn child leave walk garden charge wait sort distant reverence form grief dread first shock tiding bring shattered bewilder feeling recur dwell detail comfort sympathy affection father part such absolute brightness unprepared meeting present cloud suspense brood low low family need faith submission great young orphan deep fervent time help distance talk thing mirage world mirage answer time post oblige become busy use secretary son eye heavy remember night order bed tea  add recollect relent disappointed express belief father bury suburban church lay mother desire seek will open find fix day hour submissive reasonable possible grieve present room night return usual talk matter great deal doctor much fond doctor find glance will marriage remember leave portfolio print kind much value remarkable help wish regard daughter blush smile touch delighted grow alarm mention 
"“What! you will not tell Norman?” “No, certainly not, unless I see strong cause. They are very fond of each other, certainly, but they don’t know, and I don’t know, whether it is not like brother and sister. I would not have either of them guess at this, or feel bound in any way. Why, Ethel, she has thirty thousand pounds, and I don’t know how much more.” “Thirty thousand!” said Ethel, her tone one of astonishment, while his had been almost of objection. “It would open a great prospect,” continued Dr. May complacently; “with Norman’s talents, and such a lift as that, he might be one of the first men in England, provided he had nerve and hardness enough, which I doubt.” “He would not care for it,” said Ethel. “No; but the field of usefulness; but what an old fool I am, after all my resolutions not to be ambitious for that boy; to be set a-going by such a thing as this! Still Norman is something out of the common way. I wonder what Spencer thinks of him.” “And you never mean them to hear of it?” “If they settle it for themselves,” said Dr. May, “that sanction will come in to give double value to mine; or if I should see poor Norman hesitating as to the inequality, I might smooth the way; but you see, Ethel, this puts us in a most delicate situation towards this pretty little creature. What her father wanted was only to guard her from fortune-hunters, and if she should marry suitably elsewhere--why, we will be contented.” “I don’t think I should be,” said Ethel. “She is the most winning of humming-birds, and what we see of her now, gives one double confidence in her. She is so far from the petted, helpless girl that he, poor man, would fain have made her! And she has a bright, brave temper and elastic spirits that would be the very thing for him, poor boy, with that morbid sensitiveness--he would not hurt her, and she would brighten him. It would be a very pretty thing--but we must never think about it again.” “If we can help it,” said Ethel. “Ah! I am sorry I have put it into your head too. We shall not so easily be unconscious now, when they talk about each other in the innocent way they do. We have had a lesson against being pleased at match-making!”  But, turning away from the subject, “You shall not lose your Cocksmoor income, Ethel--” “I had never thought of that. You have taken no fees here since we have been all one family.” “Well, he has been good enough to leave me £500, and Cocksmoor can have the interest, if you like.” “Oh, thank you, papa.” “It is only its due, for I suppose that is for attendance. Personally, to myself, he has left that beautiful Claude which he knew I admired so much. He has been very kind! But, after all, we ought not to be talking of all this--I should not have known it, if I had not been forced to read the will. Well, so we are in Flora’s house, Ethel! I wonder how poor dear little Meta will feel the being a guest here, instead of the mistress. I wish that boy were three or four years older! I should like to take her straight home with us--I should like to have her for a daughter. I shall always look on her as one.” “As a Daisy!” said Ethel. “Don’t talk of it!” said Dr. May hastily; “this is no time for such things. After all, I am glad that the funeral is not here--Flora and Meta might be rather overwhelmed with these three incongruous sets of relations. By their letters, those Riverses must be quite as queer a lot as George’s relations. After all, if we have nothing else, Ethel, we have the best of it, in regard to such relations as we have.” “There is Lord Cosham,” said Ethel. “Yes, he is Meta’s guardian, as well as her brother; but he could not have her to live with him. She must depend upon Flora. But we shall see.” Ethel felt confident that Flora would be very kind to her little sister-in-law, and yet one of those gleams of doubt crossed her, whether Flora would not be somewhat jealous of her own authority. Late the next evening, the carriage drove to the door, and George and Flora appeared in the hall. Their sisters went out to meet them, and George folded Meta in his arms, and kissing her again and again, called her his poor dear little sister, and wept bitterly, and even violently. Flora stood beside Ethel, and said, in a low voice, that poor George felt it dreadfully; and then came forward, touched him gently, and told him that he must not overset Meta; and, drawing her from him, kissed her, and said what a grievous time this had been for her, and how sorry they had been to leave her so long, but they knew she was in the best hands. “Yes, I should have been so sorry you had been over-tired. I was quite well off,” said Meta. “And you must look on us as your home,” added Flora. “How can she?” thought Ethel. “This is taking possession, and making Meta a guest already!” However, Meta did not seem so to feel it--she replied by caresses, and turned again to her brother. Poor George was by far the most struck down of all the mourners, and his whole demeanour gave his new relations a much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have hoped to entertain. His gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller nature; and his want of attention and many extravagances came back upon him acutely now, in his changed home. He could hardly bear to look at his little orphan sister, and lavished every mark of fondness upon her; nor could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table; but when they had gone in to dinner, he turned away from the chair and hid his face. He was almost like a child in his want of self-restraint; and with all Dr. May’s kind soothing manner, he could not bring him to attend to any of the necessary questions as to arrangements, and was obliged to refer to Flora, whose composed good sense was never at fault. Ethel was surprised to find that it would be a great distress to Meta to part with her until the funeral was over, though she would hardly express a wish lest Ethel should be needed at home. As soon as Flora perceived this, she begged her sister to stay, and again Ethel felt unpleasantly that Meta might have seen, if she had chosen, that Flora took the invitation upon herself. So, while Dr. May, with George, Norman, and Tom, went to London, she remained, though not exactly knowing what good she was doing, unless by making the numbers rather less scanty; but both sisters declared her to be the greatest comfort possible; and when Meta shut herself up in her own room, where she had long learned to seek strength in still communing with her own heart, Flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister to hers, and talk over ordinary subjects, in a tone that struck on Ethel’s ear as a little incongruous--but then Flora had not been here from the first, and the impression could not be as strong. She was very kind, and her manner, when with others, was perfect, from its complete absence of affectation; but, alone with Ethel, there was a little complacency sometimes betrayed, and some curiosity whether her father had read the will. Ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to be extracted from her, and it certainly did not diminish Flora’s secret satisfaction in being ‘somebody’. She told the whole history of her visits; first, how cordial Lady Leonora Langdale had been, and then, how happy she had been at Glenbracken. The old Lord and Lady, and Marjorie, all equally charming in their various ways; and Norman Ogilvie so good a son, and so highly thought of in his own country. “Did I tell you, Ethel, that he desired to be remembered to you?” “Yes, you said so.” “What has Coralie done with it?” continued Flora, seeking in her dressing-case. “She must have put it away with my brooches. Oh, no, here it is. I had been looking for Cairngorm specimens in a shop, saying I wanted a brooch that you would wear, when Norman Ogilvie came riding after the carriage, looking quite hot and eager. He had been to some other place, and hunted this one up. Is it not a beauty?” It was one of the round Bruce brooches, of dark pebble, with a silver fern-leaf lying across it, the dots of small Cairngorm stones. “The Glenbracken badge, you know,” continued Flora. Ethel twisted it about in her fingers, and said, “Was not it meant for you?” “It was to oblige me, if you choose so to regard it,” said Flora, smiling. “He gave me no injunctions; but, you see, you must wear it now. I shall not wear coloured brooches for a year.” ", strong cause fond other brother sister guess feel bind way pound more tone astonishment objection open great prospect continue talent lift first man provide nerve hardness doubt care field usefulness old fool resolution ambitious boy set thing common way wonder mean hear settle sanction give double value poor hesitate inequality smooth way put delicate situation creature father want guard fortune hunter marry content  win hum bird give double confidence pett helpless girl poor man bright brave temper elastic spirit very thing poor boy morbid sensitiveness hurt bright pretty thing help sorry put head unconscious talk other innocent way lesson pleased match making turn subject lose income fee family leave interest like thank due suppose attendance leave beautiful admire kind talk force read will house wonder poor dear feel guest mistress wish boy year old like straight home like daughter  talk time such thing glad funeral overwhelm incongruous set relation letter riverse queer lot relation else regard such relation  guardian brother live depend feel confident kind sister law gleam doubt cross jealous own authority next evening carriage drive door appear hall sister meet fold arm kiss call poor dear sister goot stand low voice poor feel touch overset draw kiss grievous time sorry leave hand sorry tired home add possession guest seem feel reply caresse turn brother poor strike mourner whole demeanour give new relation warm feeling hope entertain gentle refined father impress duller nature want attention many extravagance change home bear orphan sister lavish mark fondness endure sit bottom table dinner turn chair hide face child want self restraint kind soothing manner bring attend necessary question arrangement oblige refer compose sense fault surprise find great distress part funeral express wish need home perceive begg sister stay feel choose invitation remain number scanty sister declare great comfort possible shut own room learn seek strength commun own heart seem find relief call sister talk ordinary subject tone strike ear incongruous first impression strong kind manner other perfect complete absence affectation complacency betray curiosity father read will allow hear content extract diminish secret satisfaction whole history visit cordial happy old charming various way son own country desire remember  continue seek dress case put brooche specimen shop want brooch wear ride carriage hot eager other place hunt one beauty round brooche dark pebble silver fern leaf lie dot small stone badge continue twist finger mean oblige choose regard smile give injunction wear wear coloured brooche year
