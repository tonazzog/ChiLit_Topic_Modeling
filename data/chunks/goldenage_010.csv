"Twelfth-night had come and gone, and life next morning seemed a trifle flat and purposeless. But yester-eve and the mummers were here! They had come striding into the old kitchen, powdering the red brick floor with snow from their barbaric bedizenments; and stamping, and crossing, and declaiming, till all was whirl and riot and shout. Harold was frankly afraid: unabashed, he buried himself in the cook’s ample bosom. Edward feigned a manly superiority to illusion, and greeted these awful apparitions familiarly, as Dick and Harry and Joe. As for me, I was too big to run, too rapt to resist the magic and surprise. Whence came these outlanders, breaking in on us with song and ordered masque and a terrible clashing of wooden swords? And after these, what strange visitants might we not look for any quiet night, when the chestnuts popped in the ashes, and the old ghost stories drew the awe-stricken circle close? Old Merlin, perhaps, “all furred in black sheep-skins, and a russet gown, with a bow and arrows, and bearing wild geese in his hand!” Or stately Ogier the Dane, recalled from Faery, asking his way to the land that once had need of him! Or even, on some white night, the Snow-Queen herself, with a chime of sleigh-bells and the patter of reindeers’ feet, with sudden halt at the door flung wide, while aloft the Northern Lights went shaking attendant spears among the quiet stars! This morning, house-bound by the relentless, indefatigable snow, I was feeling the reaction Edward, on the contrary, being violently stage struck on this his first introduction to the real Drama, was striding up and down the floor, proclaiming “Here be I, King Gearge the Third,” in a strong Berkshire accent. Harold, accustomed, as the youngest, to lonely antics and to sports that asked no sympathy, was absorbed in “clubmen”: a performance consisting in a measured progress round the room arm-in-arm with an imaginary companion of reverend years, with occasional halts at imaginary clubs, where--imaginary steps being leisurely ascended--imaginary papers were glanced at, imaginary scandal was discussed with elderly shakings of the head, and--regrettable to say--imaginary glasses were lifted lipwards. Heaven only knows how the germ of this dreary pastime first found way into his small-boyish being. It was his own invention, and he was proportionately proud of it. Meanwhile, Charlotte and I, crouched in the window-seat, watched, spell-stricken, the whirl and eddy and drive of the innumerable snow-flakes, wrapping our cheery little world in an uncanny uniform, ghastly in line and hue. Charlotte was sadly out of spirits. Having “countered” Miss Smedley at breakfast, during some argument or other, by an apt quotation from her favourite classic (the Fairy Book) she had been gently but firmly informed that no such things as fairies ever really existed. “Do you mean to say it’s all lies?” asked Charlotte, bluntly. Miss Smedley deprecated the use of any such unladylike words in any connection at all. “These stories had their origin, my dear,” she explained, “in a mistaken anthropomorphism in the interpretation of nature. But though we are now too well informed to fall into similar errors, there are still many beautiful lessons to be learned from these myths--” “But how can you learn anything,” persisted Charlotte, “from what doesn’t exist?” And she left the table defiant, howbeit depressed. “Don’t you mind HER,” I said, consolingly; “how can she know anything about it? Why, she can’t even throw a stone properly!” “Edward says they’re all rot, too,” replied Charlotte, doubtfully. “Edward says everything’s rot,” I explained, “now he thinks he’s going into the Army. If a thing’s in a book it MUST be true, so that settles it!” Charlotte looked almost reassured. The room was quieter now, for Edward had got the dragon down and was boring holes in him with a purring sound Harold was ascending the steps of the Athenaeum with a jaunty air--suggestive rather of the Junior Carlton. Outside, the tall elm-tops were hardly to be seen through the feathery storm. “The sky’s a-falling,” quoted Charlotte, softly; “I must go and tell the king.”  The quotation suggested a fairy story, and I offered to read to her, reaching out for the book. But the Wee Folk were under a cloud; sceptical hints had embittered the chalice. So I was fain to fetch Arthur--second favourite with Charlotte for his dames riding errant, and an easy first with us boys for his spear-splintering crash of tourney and hurtle against hopeless odds. Here again, however, I proved unfortunate,--what ill-luck made the book open at the sorrowful history of Balin and Balan? “And he vanished anon,” I read: “and so he heard an horne blow, as it had been the death of a beast. ‘That blast,’ said Balin, ‘is blowen for me, for I am the prize, and yet am I not dead.’”  Charlotte began to cry: she knew the rest too well. I shut the book in despair. Harold emerged from behind the arm-chair. He was sucking his thumb (a thing which members of the Reform are seldom seen to do), and he stared wide-eyed at his tear stained sister. Edward put off his histrionics, and rushed up to her as the consoler--a new part for him. “I know a jolly story,” he began. “Aunt Eliza told it me. It was when she was somewhere over in that beastly abroad”--(he had once spent a black month of misery at Dinan)--“and there was a fellow there who had got two storks. And one stork died--it was the she-stork.” (“What did it die of?” put in Harold.) “And the other stork was quite sorry, and moped, and went on, and got very miserable. So they looked about and found a duck, and introduced it to the stork. The duck was a drake, but the stork didn’t mind, and they loved each other and were as jolly as could be. By and by another duck came along,--a real she-duck this time,--and when the drake saw her he fell in love, and left the stork, and went and proposed to the duck: for she was very beautiful. But the poor stork who was left, he said nothing at all to anybody, but just pined and pined and pined away, till one morning he was found quite dead! But the ducks lived happily ever afterwards!” ",twelfth night life next morning seem trifle flat purposeless mummer strid old kitchen powder red brick floor snow barbaric bedizenment stamp crossing declaim whirl riot shout afraid unabashed bury cook ample bosom feign manly superiority illusion greet awful apparition big run rapt resist magic surprise outlander break song order masque terrible clashing wooden sword strange visitant quiet night chestnut pop ash old ghost story draw awe stricken circle close old furr black sheep skin russet gown bow arrow bear wild geese hand stately recall ask way land need white night chime sleigh bell patter reindeer foot sudden halt door flung northern shake attendant spear quiet star morning house bind relentless indefatigable snow feel reaction contrary stage strike first introduction real strid floor proclaim third strong accent accustom young lonely antic sport ask sympathy absorb clubmen performance consist measure progress room arm arm imaginary companion reverend year occasional halt imaginary club imaginary step ascend imaginary paper glance imaginary scandal discuss elderly shaking head regrettable imaginary glasses lift lipward heaven germ dreary pastime find way small boyish being own invention proud crouch window seat watch spell stricken whirl eddy drive innumerable snow flake wrap cheery world uncanny uniform ghastly line hue spirit counter breakfast argument other apt quotation favourite classic inform such thing fairy exist mean lie ask deprecate use such unladylike word connection story origin dear explain mistaken anthropomorphism interpretation nature inform fall similar error many beautiful lesson learn myth learn persist exist leave table defiant depressed mind throw stone rot reply rot explain thing book true settle reassure room quiet dragon boring hole purr sound ascend step jaunty air suggestive junior tall elm top feathery storm sky falling quote king quotation suggest fairy story offer read reach book cloud sceptical hint embitter chalice fain fetch second favourite dame riding errant easy first boy spear splintering crash tourney hurtle hopeless odd prove unfortunate ill luck book open sorrowful history vanish anon read hear blow death beast blast blowen prize dead begin cry rest shut book despair emerge arm chair suck thumb thing member reform stare wide eye tear stain sister put histrionics rush consoler new part jolly story begin beastly spend black month misery fellow stork stork die stork die put other stork sorry moped miserable find duck introduce stork duck drake stork mind love other jolly duck real duck time drake fall love leave stork propose duck beautiful poor stork leave pine pine pine morning find dead duck live
