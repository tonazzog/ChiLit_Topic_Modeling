"CHAPTER IX. ""DEAD FLIES,"" OR ""YE SHALL BE AS GODS"" ""In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night."" PROV. vii. 9. At Roslyn, even in summer, the hour for going to bed was half-past nine. It was hardly likely that so many boys, overflowing with turbulent life, should lie down quietly, and get to sleep. They never dreamt of doing so. Very soon after the masters were gone, the sconces were often relighted, sometimes in separate dormitories, sometimes in all of them, and the boys amused themselves by reading novels or making a row. They would play various games about the bedrooms, vaulting or jumping over the beds, running races in sheets, getting through the windows upon the roofs, to frighten the study-boys with sham ghosts, or playing the thousand other pranks which suggested themselves to the fertile imagination of fifteen. But the favorite amusement was a bolstering match. One room would challenge another, and, stripping the covers off their bolsters, would meet in mortal fray. A bolster well wielded, especially when dexterously applied to the legs, is a very efficient instrument to bring a boy to the ground; but it doesn't hurt very much, even when the blows fall on the head. Hence these matches were excellent trials of strength and temper, and were generally accompanied with shouts of laughter, never ending until one side was driven back to its own room. Many a long and tough struggle had Eric enjoyed, and his prowess was so universally acknowledged, that his dormitory, No. 7, was a match for any other, and far stronger in this warfare than most of the rest. At bolstering, Duncan was a perfect champion; his strength and activity were marvellous, and his mirth uproarious. Eric and Graham backed him up brilliantly; while Llewellyn and Attlay, with sturdy vigor, supported the skirmishers. Bull, the sixth boy in No. 7, was the only _fainéant_ among them, though he did occasionally help to keep off the smaller fry. Happy would it have been for all of them if Bull had never been placed in No. 7; happier still if he had never come to Roslyn school. Backward in work, overflowing with vanity at his supposed good looks, of mean disposition and feeble intellect, he was the very worst specimen of a boy that Eric had ever seen. Not even Barker so deeply excited Eric's repulsion and contempt. And yet, since the affair of Upton, Barker and Eric were declared enemies, and, much to the satisfaction of the latter, never spoke to each other; but with Bull--much as he inwardly loathed him--he was professedly and apparently on good terms. His silly love of universal popularity made him accept and tolerate the society even of this worthless boy. Any two boys talking to each other about Bull would probably profess to like him ""well enough,"" but if they were honest, they would generally end by allowing their contempt. ""We've got a nice set in No. 7, haven't we?"" said Duncan to Eric one day. ""Capital. Old Llewellyn's a stunner, and I like Attlay and Graham."" ""Don't you like Bull then?"" The two boys looked each other in the face, then, like the confidential augurs, burst out laughing. ""You know you detest him,"" said Duncan. ""No, I don't. He never did me any harm that I know of."" ""Him!--well, _I_ detest him."" ""Well!"" answered Eric, ""on coming to think of it, so do I. And yet he is popular enough in the school. I wonder how that is."" ""He's not _really_ popular. I've often noticed that fellows pretty generally despise him, yet somehow don't like to say so."" ""Why do you dislike him, Duncan?"" ""I don't know. Why do you?"" ""I don't know either."" Neither Eric nor Duncan meant this answer to be false, and yet if they had taken the trouble to consider, they would have found out in their secret souls the reasons of their dislike. Bull had been to school before, and of this school he often bragged as the acmé of desirability and wickedness. He was always telling boys what they did at ""his old school,"" and he quite inflamed the minds of such as fell under his influence by marvellous tales of the wild and wilful things which he and his former school-fellows had done. Many and many a scheme of sin and mischief, at Roslyn was suggested, planned, and carried out on the model of Bull's reminiscences of his previous life. He had tasted more largely of the tree of the knowledge of evil than any other boy, and strange to say, this was the secret why the general odium was never expressed. He claimed his guilty experience so often as a ground of superiority, that at last the claim was silently allowed. He spoke from the platform of more advanced iniquity, and the others listened first curiously, then eagerly to his words. ""Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."" Such was the temptation which assailed the other boys in dormitory No. 7; and Eric among the number. Bull was the tempter. Secretly, gradually, he dropped into their too willing ears the poison of his polluting acquirements. In brief, Bull was cursed with a degraded and corrupting mind. I hurry over a part of my subject inconceivably painful; I hurry over it, but if I am to perform my self-imposed duty of giving a true picture of what school life _sometimes_ is, I must not pass it by altogether. The first time that Eric heard indecent words in dormitory No. 7, he was shocked beyond bound or measure. Dark though it was, he felt himself blushing scarlet to the roots of his hair, and then growing pale again, while a hot dew was left upon his forehead. Bull was the speaker; but this time there was a silence, and the subject instantly dropped. The others felt that ""a new boy"" was in the room; they did not know how he would take it; they were unconsciously abashed. Besides, though they had themselves joined in such conversation before, they did not love it, and on the contrary, felt ashamed of yielding to it. Now, Eric, now or never! Life and death, ruin and salvation, corruption and purity, are perhaps in the balance together, and the scale of your destiny may hang on a single word of yours. Speak out, boy! Tell these fellows that unseemly words wound your conscience; tell them that they are ruinous, sinful, damnable; speak out and save yourself and the rest. Virtue is strong and beautiful, Eric, and vice is downcast in her awful presence. Lose your purity of heart, Eric, and you have lost a jewel which the whole world, if it were ""one entire and perfect chrysolite,"" cannot replace. Good spirits guard that young boy, and give him grace in this his hour of trial! Open his eyes that he may see the fiery horses and the fiery chariots of the angels who would defend him, and the dark array of spiritual foes who throng around his bed. Point a pitying finger to the yawning abyss of shame, ruin, and despair that even now perhaps is being cleft under his feet. Show him the garlands of the present and the past, withering at the touch of the Erinnys in the future. In pity, in pity show him the canker which he is introducing into the sap of the tree of life, which shall cause its root to be hereafter as bitterness, and its blossom to go up as dust.

"But the sense of sin was on Eric's mind. How _could_ he speak? was not his own language sometimes profane? How--how could he profess to reprove another boy on the ground of morality, when he himself said did things less ruinous perhaps, but equally forbidden? For half an hour, in an agony of struggle with himself, Eric lay silent. Since Bull's last words nobody had spoken. They were going to sleep. It was too late to speak now, Eric thought. The moment passed by for ever; Eric had listened without objection to foul words, and the irreparable harm was done. How easy it would have been to speak! With the temptation, God had provided also a way to escape. Next time it came, it was far harder to resist, and it soon became, to men, impossible. Ah Eric, Eric! how little we know the moments which decide the destinies of life. We live on as usual. The day is a common day, the hour a common hour. We never thought twice about the change of intention, which by one of the accidents--(accidents!)--of life determined for good or for evil, for happiness or misery, the color of our remaining years. The stroke of the pen was done in a moment which led unconsciously to our ruin; the word was uttered quite heedlessly, on which turned for ever the decision of our weal or woe. Eric lay silent. The darkness was not broken by the flashing of an angel's wing, the stillness was not syllabled by the sound of an angel's voice; but to his dying day Eric never forgot the moments which passed, until, weary and self-reproachful, he fell asleep. Next morning he awoke, restless and feverish. He at once remembered what had passed. Bull's words haunted him; he could not forget them; they burnt within him like the flame of a moral fever. He was moody and petulant, and for a time could hardly conceal his aversion to Bull. Ah Eric! moodiness and petulance cannot save you, but prayerfulness would; one word, Eric, at the throne of grace--one prayer before you go down among the boys, that God in his mercy would wash away, in the blood of his dear Son, your crimson stains, and keep your conscience and memory clean. The boy knelt down for a few minutes, and repeated to himself a few formal words. Had he stayed longer on his knees, he might have given way to a burst of penitence and supplication--but he heard Bull's footstep, and getting up, he ran down stairs to breakfast; so Eric did not pray. Conversations did not generally drop so suddenly in dormitory No. 7. On the contrary, they generally flashed along in the liveliest way, till some one said ""Good night;"" and then the boys turned off to sleep. Eric knew this, and instantly conjectured that it was only a sort of respect for him, and ignorance of the manner in which he would consider it, that prevented Duncan and the rest from taking any further notice of Bull's remark. It was therefore no good disburdening his mind to any of them; but he determined to speak about the matter to Russell in their next walk. They usually walked together on Sunday. Dr. Rowlands had discontinued the odious and ridiculous custom of the younger boys taking their exercise under a master's inspection. Boys are not generally fond of constitutionals, so that on the half-holidays they almost entirely confined their open-air exercise to the regular games, and many of them hardly left the play-ground boundaries once a week. But on Sundays they often went walks, each with his favorite friend or companion. When Eric first came as a boarder, he invariably went with Russell on Sunday, and many a pleasant stroll they had taken together, sometimes accompanied by Duncan, Montagu, or Owen. The latter, however, had dropped even this intercourse with Eric, who for the last few weeks had more often gone with his new friend Upton. ""Come a walk, boy,"" said Upton, as they left the dining-room. ""O excuse me to-day, Upton,"" said Eric, ""I'm going with your cousin."" ""Oh _very_ well,"" said Upton, in high dudgeon, and, hoping to make Eric jealous, he went a walk with Graham, whom he had ""taken up"" before he knew Williams. Russell was rather surprised when Eric came to him and said, ""Come a stroll to Fort Island, Edwin--will you?"" ""O yes,"" said Russell cheerfully; ""why, we haven't seen each other for some time lately! I was beginning to fancy that you meant to drop me, Eric."" He spoke with a smile, and in a rallying tone, but Eric hung his head, for the charge was true. Proud of his popularity among all the school, and especially at his friendship with so leading a fellow as Upton, Eric had _not_ seen much of his friend since their last conversation about swearing. Indeed, conscious of failure, he felt sometimes uneasy in Russell's company. He faltered, and answered humbly, ""I hope you will never drop _me_, Edwin, however bad I get? But I particularly want to speak to you to-day."" In an instant Russell had twined his arm in Eric's, as they turned towards Fort Island; and Eric, with an effort, was just going to begin, when they heard Montagu's voice calling after them-- ""I say, you fellows, where are you off to! may I come with you?"" ""O yes, Monty, do,"" said Russell, ""It will be quite like old times; now that my cousin Horace has got hold of Eric, we have to sing 'When shall we three meet again?'"" Russell only spoke in fun; but, unintentionally, his words jarred in Eric's heart. He was silent, and answered in monosyllables, so the walk was provokingly dull. At last they reached Fort Island, and sat down by the ruined chapel looking on the sea. ""Why what's the row with you, old boy,"" said Montagu, playfully shaking Eric by the shoulder, ""you're as silent as Zimmerman on Solitude, and as doleful as Harvey on the Tombs. I expect you've been going through a select course of Blair's Grave, Young's Night Thoughts, and Drelincourt on Death."" To his surprise Eric's head was still bent, and, at last, he heard a deep suppressed sigh. ""My dear child, what is the matter with you?"" said Russell, affectionately taking his hand, ""surely you're not offended at my nonsense?"" Eric had not liked to speak while Montagu was by, but now he gulped down his rising emotion, and briefly told them of Bull's vile words the night before. They listened in silence. ""I knew it must come, Eric,"" said Russell at last, ""and I am so sorry you didn't speak at the time."" ""Do the fellows ever talk in that way in either of your dormitories?"" asked Eric. ""No,"" said Russell. ""Very little,"" said Montagu. A pause followed, during which all three plucked the grass and looked away. ""Let me tell you,"" said Russell solemnly; ""my father (he is dead now you know, Eric), when I was sent to school, warned me of this kind of thing. I had been brought up in utter ignorance of such coarse knowledge as is forced upon one here, and with my reminiscences of home, I could not bear even that much of it which was impossible to avoid. But the very first time such talk was begun in my dormitory I spoke out. What I said I don't know, but I felt as if I was trampling on a slimy poisonous adder, and, at any rate, I showed such pain and distress that the fellows dropped it at the time. Since then I have absolutely refused to stay in the room if ever such talk is begun. So it never is now, and I do think the fellows are very glad of it themselves.""
