"CHAPTER XXX. SAINT PRISSY, PEACEMAKER.  This is the letter which, according to his promise, General Napoleon Smith despatched to the accredited leader of the Smoutchy boys--or, as they delighted to call themselves, the Comanche Cowboys.      WINDY STANDARD HOUSE, BORDERSHIRE.      _DEAR SIR,--This is to warn you that on Saturday the 18th,      between the hours of ten in the morning and six in the evening,      we, the rightful owners of the Castle of Windy Standard, will      take possession of our proppaty. Prevent us at your peril. You      had better get out, for we're coming, and our motty is 'Smith      for ever, and No Quarter!'_      _Given under our hand and seal._      _General-Feeld-Marshall-Commanding._      _P.S.--I'll teach you to kick my legs with tacketty butes and      put me in nasty dunguns. Wait till I catch you, Nipper      Donnan._ The reply came back on a piece of wrapping paper from the butcher's shop, rendered warlike by undeniable stains of gore. It had, to all appearance, been written with a skewer, and contrasted ill with the blue official paper purloined out of Mr. Picton Smith's office, on which the challenge had been sent. It ran thus:----      _Matthew Donnan & Co.,      Butchers and Cattle Salesmen,      21 High Street, Edam, Bordershire._      _DEAR SIR.--Yours of the 13th received, and contents noted.      Come on, you stuck-up retches. We can fight you any day with      our one hand tied behind us. Better leave girls and childer at      home, for we meen fightin' this time--and no error.--We'll nock      you into eternal smash._      _Hoping to be favoured with a continuance of your esteemed      orders,--I have the honour to remain, Sir, your obedient      servant to command,_ The high contracting parties having thus agreed upon terms of mutual animosity, to all appearance there remained only the arbitrament of battle. But other thoughts were working in the tender heart of Prissy Smith. She had no sympathy with bloodshed, and had she been in her father's place she would at once have given the town all their desires at any price, in order that the peace might be kept. Deeply and sincerely she bewailed the spirit of quarrelling and bloodshed which was abroad. She had her own intentions as to the enemy, Hugh John had his--which he had so succinctly summed up in the ""favour of the 13th,"" acknowledged with such businesslike precision by Mr. Nipper Donnan in his reply to General Napoleon's blue official cartel. Without taking any one into her confidence (not even Sammy Carter, who might have laughed at her), Priscilla Smith resolved to set out on a mission of reconciliation to the Comanche Cowboys. Long and deeply she prepared herself by self-imposed penances for the work that was before her. She was, she knew, no Joan of Arc to lead an army in battle array against a cruel and taunting enemy. She was to be a St. Catherine of Siena rather, setting out alone and unfriended on a pilgrimage of mercy. She had read all she could lay her hands on about the tanner's daughter, and a picture of the great barn-like brick church of San Dominico where she had her visions, hung over the wash-stand in Prissy's little room, and to her pious eyes made the plain deal table seem the next thing to an altar. Prissy wanted to go and have visions too; and so, three times a day she went in pilgrimage to the tool-house where the potatoes were stored, as being the next best thing to the unattainable San Dominico. This was a roomy place more than half underground, and had a vaulted roof which was supported by pillars--the remains, doubtless, of some much more ancient structure. Here Prissy waited, like the Scholar Gipsy, for the light from heaven to fall; but, alas, the light refused to come to time. Well, then, she must just go on without it as many another eager soul had done before her. There only remained to make the final preparations. On the morrow therefore she waited carefully after early dinner till General Smith and Toady Lion had gone off in the direction of the mill-dam. Then she took out the little basket which she had concealed in the crypt of San Dominico--that is to say in the potato house. It stood ready packed and covered with a white linen cloth. It was a basket which had been prepared upon the strictest missionary models. She had no printed authorities which went the length of telling her what provision for the way, what bribes and presents Saint Catherine carried forth to appease withal the enemies of her city and country. But there was on record the exact provision of the mission-chest of a woman, who in her time went forth to turn to gentleness the angry hearts of brigands and robbers--one Abigail, the wife of a certain churl of Maon, a village near to the roots of Mount Carmel. True, Prissy could not quite make up the tale of her presents on the same generous and wholesale scale. She had to preach according to her stipend, like the Glasgow wife of the legend, who, upon the doctor ordering her husband champagne and oysters, informed a friend that ""poor folk like us couldna juist gie Tammas champeen-an'-ighsters, but we did the next best thing--we gied him whelks-an'-ginger-beer."" So since it might have attracted some attention, even on pastures so well stocked as those of Mr. Picton Smith of Windy Standard, if Prissy had taken with her ""five sheep ready dressed,"" she had to be content with half of a sheep's-head-pie, which she had begged ""to give away"" from Janet Sheepshanks. To this she added a four pound loaf she had bought in Edam with her own money (Abigail's two hundred being distinctly out of her reach)--together with the regulation cluster of raisins and cake of figs which were both well within her means. In addition, since Prissy was a strict teetotaler, she took with her a little apparatus for making tea, some sugar and cream from the pantry, and her largest and best set of dolls' cups and saucers. All this occupied a good deal of room and was exceedingly heavy, so that Prissy had very often to rest on the way towards the castle. She might have failed altogether, but that she saw Mike raking the gravel of the path near the edge of the water, and asked him to carry the basket for her over the stepping-stones. Prince Michael, who as he often remarked was ""spoiling for another taste of Donnybrook,"" conveyed the basket over Edam Water for his young mistress, without the least idea of the strange quest upon which the girl was going. He laid it down and looked at the linen cover. ""Faix,"" he said, ""sure 'tis a long road to sind a young lady wid a heavy load like that!"" Now, this was his mode of inviting an explanation, but Prissy was far too wise to offer one. She merely thanked him and went on her way towards the castle.
