"CHAPTER 6. FIRST RAMBLE. Hugh's afternoon lessons were harder than those of the morning; and in the evening he found he had so much to do that there was very little time left for writing his letter home.  Some time there was, however; and Firth did not forget to rule his paper, and to let Hugh use his ink. Hugh had been accustomed to copy the prints he found in the Voyages and Travels he read; and he could never see a picture of a savage but he wanted to copy it.  He was thus accustomed to a pretty free use of his slate-pencil.  He now thought that it would save a great deal of description if he sent a picture or two in his letter: so he flourished off, on the first page, a sketch of Mr Tooke sitting at his desk at the top of the school, and of Mr Carnaby standing at his desk at the bottom of the school. The next evening he made haste to fill up the sheet, for he found his business increasing upon his hands so fast that he did not know when he should get his letter off, if he did not despatch it at once.  He was just folding it up when Tom Holt observed that it was a pity not to put some words into the mouths of the figures, to make them more animated; and he showed Hugh, by the curious carvings of their desks, how to put words into the mouths of figures.  Hugh then remembered having seen this done in the caricatures in the print-shops in London; and he seized on the idea.  He put into Mr Tooke's mouth the words which were oftenest heard from him, ""Proceed, gentlemen;"" and into Mr Carnaby's, ""Hold your din."" Firth was too busy with his sense-verses to mind the little boys, as they giggled, with their heads close together, over Hugh's sheet of paper; but the usher was never too busy to be aware of any fun which might possibly concern his dignity.  He had his eye on the new boys the whole while.  He let Hugh direct his letter, and paint up a stroke or two which did not look so well as the rest; and it was not till Hugh was rolling the wafer about on his tongue that he interfered.  Mr Carnaby then came up, tapped Hugh's head, told him not to get on so fast, for that every letter must be looked over before it went to the post.  While saying this, he took the letter, and put it into his waistcoat pocket. In vain Hugh begged to have it again, saying he would write another. The more he begged, and the more dismayed Tom Holt looked, the less Mr Carnaby would attend to either.  Firth let himself be interrupted to hear the case: but he could do nothing in it.  It was a general rule, which he thought every boy had known; and it was too late now to prevent the letter being looked over. Mr Carnaby was so angry at the liberty Hugh had taken with his face and figure, that, in spite of all prayers, and a good many tears, he walked up the school with the letter, followed by poor Hugh, as soon as Mr Tooke had taken his seat next morning.  Hugh thought that Holt, who had put him up to the most offensive part of the pictures, might have borne him company; but Holt was a timid boy, and he really had not courage to leave his seat.  So Hugh stood alone, awaiting Mr Tooke's awful words, while the whole of the first class looked up from their books, in expectation of what was to happen.  They waited some time for the master's words; for he was trying to help laughing.  He and Mr Carnaby were so much alike in the pictures, and both so like South Sea islanders, that it was impossible to help laughing at the thought of this sketch going abroad as a representation of the Crofton masters.  At last all parties laughed aloud, and Mr Tooke handed Hugh his wafer-glass, and bade him wafer up his letter, and by all means send it. Mr Carnaby could not remain offended if his principal was not angry: so here the matter ended, except that Hugh made some strong resolutions about his future letters, and that the corners of the master's mouth were seen to be out of their usual order several times in the course of the morning. This incident, and everything which haunted Hugh's mind, and engrossed his attention, was a serious evil to him; for his business soon grew to be more than his habit of mind was equal to.  In a few days, he learned to envy the boys (and they were almost the whole school) who could fix their attention completely and immediately on the work before them, and relax as completely, when it was accomplished.  When his eyes were wandering, they observed boy after boy frowning over his dictionary, or repeating to himself, earnestly and without pause; and presently the business was done, and the learner at ease, feeling confident that he was ready to meet his master.  After double the time had passed Hugh was still trying to get the meaning of his lesson into his head--going over the same words a dozen times, without gaining any notion of their meaning--suffering, in short from his long habit of inattention at home. He did now try hard; but he seemed to get only headaches for his pains. His brother saw enough to make him very sorry for Hugh before ten days were over.  He might not, perhaps, have been struck with his anxious countenance, his frequent starts, and his laying his head down on his desk because it ached so, if it had not been for what happened at night. Sometimes Hugh started out of bed, and began to dress, when the elder boys went up with their light, only an hour after the younger ones. Sometimes he would begin saying his syntax in the middle of the night, fancying he was standing before Mr Carnaby; and once he walked in his sleep as far as the head of the stairs, and then suddenly woke, and could not make out where he was.  Phil should have told Mr Tooke of these things; but Hugh was so very anxious that nobody should know of his ""tricks"" (as the boys in his room called his troubles), that Phil only mentioned the matter to Mrs Watson, who had known so many bad sleepers among little boys, and had so little idea that the habit was anything new, that she took scarcely any notice of it.  She had his hair cut very short and close, and saw that he took a moderate supper, and was satisfied that all would be well.  Hugh did not part with his hair till he had joked himself about its length as much as any one could quiz him for it.  When he had pulled it down over the end of his nose, and peeped through it, like an owl out of an ivy-bush, he might be supposed to part with it voluntarily, and not because he was laughed at. Phil's observation of his brother's toil and trouble led him to give him some help.  Almost every day he would hear Hugh say his lesson--or try to say it; for the poor boy seldom succeeded.  Phil sometimes called him stupid, and sometimes refrained from saying so, whatever he might think; but there really was very little difference in the result, whether Phil heard the lessons beforehand or not; and it gave Joe Cape a great advantage over Phil that he had no little brother to attend to. Considering how selfish rivalship is apt to make boys (and even men), it was perhaps no wonder that Phil sometimes kept out of Hugh's way at the right hour, saying to himself that his proper business was to do his lessons, and get or keep ahead of Joe Cape; and that Hugh must take his chance, and work his own way, as other boys had to do.  This conduct might not be wondered at in Phil; but it hurt Hugh, and made him do his lessons all the worse.  He did not like to expose his brother's unkindness to any one, or he would oftener have asked Firth to help him. Firth, too, had plenty of work of his own to do.  More than once, however, Firth met the little lad, wandering about, with his grammar in his hand, in search of the hidden Phil; and then Firth would stop him, and sit down with him, and have patience, and give him such clear explanations, such good examples of the rules he was to learn, that it all became easy, and Hugh found his lessons were to him only what those of other boys seemed to them.  Still, however, and at the best, Hugh was, as a learner, far too much at the mercy of circumstances--the victim of what passed before his eyes, or was said within his hearing.

"Boys who find difficulty in attending to their lessons are sure to be more teased with interruptions than any others.  Holt had not the habit of learning; and he and Hugh were continually annoyed by the boys who sat near them watching how they got on, and making remarks upon them. One day, Mr Tooke was called out of the school-room to a visitor, and Mr Carnaby went up to take the master's place, and hear his class. This was too good an opportunity for the boys below to let slip; and they began to play tricks,--most of them directed against Hugh and Tom Holt.  One boy, Warner, began to make the face that always made Holt laugh, however he tried to be grave.  Page drew a caricature of Mrs Watson on his slate, and held it up; and Davison took a mask out of his desk, and even ventured to tie it on, as if it had not been school-time. ""I declare I can't learn my lesson--'tis too bad!"" cried Hugh. ""'Tis a shame!"" said Tom Holt, sighing for breath after his struggle not to laugh.  ""We shall never be ready."" Hugh made gestures of indignation at the boys, which only caused worse faces to be made, and the mask to nod. ""We wont look at them,"" proposed Holt.  ""Let us cover our eyes, and not look up at all."" Hugh put his hands before his eyes; but still his mind's eye saw the grinning mask, and his lesson did not get on.  Besides, a piece of wet sponge lighted on the very page he was learning from.  He looked up fiercely, to see who had thrown it.  It was no other than Tooke, who belonged to that class:--it was Tooke, to judge by his giggle, and his pretending to hide his face, as if ashamed.  Hugh tossed back the sponge, so as to hit Tooke on the nose.  Then Tooke was angry, and threw it again, and the sponge passed backwards and forwards several times: for Hugh was by this time very angry,--boiling with indignation at the hardship of not being able to learn his lesson, when he really would if he could.  While the sponge was still passing to and fro, Mr Carnaby's voice was heard from the far end of the room, desiring Warner, Page, Davison, and Tooke to be quiet, and let the boys alone till Mr Tooke came in, when Mr Tooke would take his own measures. Hugh, wondering how Mr Carnaby knew, at that distance, what was going on, found that Holt was no longer by his side.  In a moment, Holt returned to his seat, flushed and out of breath.  A very slight hiss was heard from every form near, as he came down the room. ""O!  Holt!  You have been telling tales!"" cried Hugh. ""Telling tales!"" exclaimed Holt, in consternation, for Holt knew nothing of school ways.  ""I never thought of that.  They asked me to tell Mr Carnaby that we could not learn our lessons."" ""They!  Who?  I am sure I never asked you."" ""No; you did not: but Harvey and Prince did,--and Gillingham.  They said Mr Carnaby would soon make those fellows quiet; and they told me to go."" ""You hear!  They are calling you `tell-tale.'  That will be your name now.  Oh, Holt!  You should not have told tales.  However, I will stand by you,"" Hugh continued, seeing the terror that Holt was in. ""I meant no harm,"" said Holt, trembling.  ""Was not it a shame that they would not let us learn our lessons?"" At this moment Mr Tooke entered the room.  As he passed the forms, the boys were all bent over their books, as if they could think of nothing else.  Mr Tooke walked up the room to his desk, and Mr Carnaby walked down the room to _his_ desk; and then Mr Carnaby said, quite aloud,-- ""Mr Tooke, sir."" Here Holt sprang from his desk, and ran to the usher, and besought him not to say a word about what Warner's class had been doing.  He even hung on Mr Carnaby's arm in entreaty; but Mr Carnaby shook him off, and commanded him back to his seat.  Then the whole school heard Mr Tooke told about the wry faces and the mask, and the trouble of the little boys.  Mr Tooke was not often angry; but when he was, his face grew white, and his lips trembled.  His face was white now.  He stood up, and called before him the little boy who had informed.  Hugh chose to go with Holt, though Holt had not gone up with him about the letter, the other day; and Holt felt how kind this was.  Mr Tooke desired to know who the offenders were; and as they were named, he called to them to stand up in their places.  Then came the sentence.  Mr Tooke would never forgive advantage being taken of his absence.  If there were boys who could not be trusted while his back was turned, they must be made to remember him when he was out of sight, by punishment.  Page must remain in school after hours, to learn twenty lines of Virgil; Davison twenty; Tooke forty-- Here everybody looked round to see how Tooke bore his father being so angry with him. ""Please, sir,"" cried one boy, ""I saw little Proctor throw a sponge at Tooke.  He did it twice."" ""Never mind!"" answered Tooke.  ""I threw it at him first.  It is my sponge."" ""And Warner,"" continued the master, as if he had not heard the interruption, ""considering that Warner has got off too easily for many pranks of late,--Warner seventy."" Seventy!  The idea of having anybody condemned, through him, to learn seventy lines of Latin by heart, made Holt so miserable that the word seventy seemed really to prick his very ears.  Though Mr Tooke's face was still white, Holt ventured up to him, ""Pray, sir--"" ""Not a word of intercession for those boys,"" said the master.  ""I will not hear a word in their favour."" ""Then, sir--"" ""I only want to say, then, that Proctor told no tales, sir.  I did not mean any harm, sir, but I told because--"" ""Never mind that,"" cried Hugh, afraid that he would now be telling of Harvey, Prince, and Gillingham, who had persuaded him to go up. ""I have nothing to do with that.  That is your affair,"" said the master, sending the boys back to their seats. Poor Holt had cause to rue this morning, for long after.  He was weary of the sound of hissing, and of the name ""tell-tale;"" and the very boys who had prompted him to go up were at first silent, and then joined against him.  He complained to Hugh of the difficulty of knowing what it was right to do.  He had been angry on Hugh's account chiefly; and he still thought it _was_ very unjust to hinder their lessons, when they wished not to be idle: and yet they were all treating him as if he had done something worse than the boys with the mask.  Hugh thought all this was true: but he believed it was settled among schoolboys (though Holt had never had the opportunity of knowing it) that it was a braver thing for boys to bear any teasing from one another than to call in the power of the master to help.  A boy who did that was supposed not to be able to take care of himself; and for this he was despised, besides being disliked, for having brought punishment upon his companions. Holt wished Hugh had not been throwing sponges at the time:--he wished Hugh had prevented his going up.  He would take good care how he told tales again. ""You had better say so,"" advised Hugh; ""and then they will see that you had never been at school, and did not know how to manage."" The first Saturday had been partly dreaded, and partly longed for, by Hugh.  He had longed for the afternoon's ramble; but Saturday morning was the time for saying tables, among other things.  Nothing happened as he had expected.  The afternoon was so rainy that there was no going out; and, as for the tables, he was in a class of five; and ""four times seven"" did not come to him in regular course.  Eight times seven did, and he said ""fifty-six"" with great satisfaction, Mr Carnaby asked him afterwards the dreaded question, but he was on his guard; and as he answered it right, and the usher had not found out the joke, he hoped he should hear no more of the matter.

"The next Saturday was fine, and at last he was to have the walk he longed for.  The weekly repetitions were over, dinner was done, Mr Carnaby appeared with his hat on, the whole throng burst into the open air, and out of bounds, and the new boys were wild with expectation and delight.  When they had passed the churchyard and the green, and were wading through the sandy road which led up to the heath, Firth saw Hugh running and leaping hither and thither, not knowing what to do with his spirits.  Firth called him, and putting his arm round Hugh's neck, so as to keep him prisoner, said he did not know how he might want his strength before he got home, and he had better not spend it on a bit of sandy road.  So Hugh was made to walk quietly, and gained his breath before the breezy heath was reached. On the way, he saw that a boy of the name of Dale, whom he had never particularly observed before, was a good deal teased by some boys who kept crossing their hands before them, and curtseying like girls, talking in a mincing way, and calling one another Amelia, with great affectation.  Dale tried to get away, but he was followed, whichever way he turned. ""What do they mean by that?"" inquired Hugh of Firth. ""Dale has a sister at a school not far off, and her name is Amelia; and she came to see him to-day.  Ah!  You have not found out yet that boys are laughed at about their sisters, particularly if the girls have fine names."" ""What a shame!"" cried Hugh; words which he had used very often already since he came to Crofton. He broke from Firth, ran up to Dale, and said to him, in a low voice, ""I have two sisters, and one of them is called Agnes."" ""Don't let them come to see you, then, or these fellows will quiz you as they do me.  As if I could help having a sister Amelia!"" ""Why, you are not sorry for that?  You would not wish your sister dead, or not born, would you?"" ""No; but I wish she was not hereabouts: that is, I wish she had not come up to the pales, with the maid-servant behind her, for everybody to see. And then, when Mr Tooke sent us into the orchard together, some spies were peeping over the wall at us all the time."" ""I only wish Agnes would come,"" cried Hugh, ""and I would--"" ""Ah!  You think so now; but depend upon it, you would like much better to see her at home.  Why, her name is finer than my sister's!  I wonder what girls ever have such names for!"" ""I don't see that these names are finer than some boys' names.  There's Frazer, is not his name Colin?  And then there's Hercules Fisticuff--"" ""Why, you know--to be sure you know that is a nick-name?"" said Dale. ""Is it?  I never thought of that,"" replied Hugh.  ""What is his real name?"" ""Samuel Jones.  However, there is Colin Frazer--and Fry, his name is Augustus Adolphus; I will play them off the next time they quiz Amelia. How old is your sister Agnes?"" Then the two boys wandered off among the furze bushes, talking about their homes; and in a little while they had so opened their hearts to each other, that they felt as if they had always been friends.  Nobody thought any more about them when once the whole school was dispersed over the heath.  Some boys made for a hazel copse, some way beyond the heath, in hopes of finding a few nuts already ripe.  Others had boats to float on the pond.  A large number played leap-frog, and some ran races. Mr Carnaby threw himself down on a soft couch of wild thyme, on a rising ground, and took out his book.  So Dale and Hugh felt themselves unobserved, and they chatted away at a great rate.  Not but that an interruption or two did occur.  They fell in with a flock of geese, and Hugh did not much like their appearance, never having heard a goose make a noise before.  He had eaten roast goose, and he had seen geese in the feathers at the poulterers'; but he had never seen them alive, and stretching their necks at passengers.  He flinched at the first moment. Dale, who never imagined that a boy who was not afraid of his schoolfellows could be afraid of geese, luckily mistook the movement, and said, ""Ay, get a switch,--a bunch of furze will do, and we will be rid of the noisy things."" He drove them away, and Hugh had now learned, for ever, how much noise geese can make, and how little they are to be feared. They soon came upon some creatures which were larger and stronger, and with which Hugh was no better acquainted.  Some cows were grazing, or had been grazing, till a party of boys came up.  They were now restless, moving uneasily about, so that Dale himself hesitated for a moment which way to go.  Lamb was near,--the passionate boy, who was nobody's friend, and who was therefore seldom at play with others.  He was also something of a coward, as any one might know from his frequent bullying.  He and Holt happened to be together at this time; and it was their appearance of fright at the restless cows which frightened Hugh.  One cow at last began to trot towards them at a pretty good rate.  Lamb ran off to the right, and the two little boys after him, though Dale pulled at Hugh's hand to make him stand still, as Dale chose to do himself.  He pulled in vain--Hugh burst away, and off went the three boys, over the hillocks and through the furze, the cow trotting at some distance behind.  They did not pause till Lamb had led them off the heath into a deep lane, different from the one by which they had come.  The cow stopped at a patch of green grass, just at the entrance of the hollow way; and the runners therefore could take breath. ""Now we are here,"" said Lamb, ""I will show you a nice place,--a place where we can get something nice.  How thirsty I am!"" ""And so am I,"" declared Holt, smacking his dry tongue.  Hugh's mouth was very dry too, between the run and the fright. ""Well, then, come along with me, and I will show you,"" said Lamb. Hugh thought they ought not to go farther from the heath: but Lamb said they would get back by another way,--through a gate belonging to a friend of his.  They could not get back the way they came, because the cow was there still.  He walked briskly on till they came to a cottage, over whose door swung a sign; and on the sign was a painting of a bottle and a glass, and a heap of things which were probably meant for cakes, as there were cakes in the window.  Here Lamb turned in, and the woman seemed to know him well.  She smiled, and closed the door behind the three boys, and asked them to sit down: but Lamb said there was no time for that to-day,--she must be quick.  He then told the boys that they would have some ginger-beer. ""But may we?"" asked the little boys. ""To be sure; who is to prevent us?  You shall see how you like ginger-beer when you are thirsty."" The woman declared that it was the most wholesome thing in the world; and if the young gentleman did not find it so, she would never ask him to taste her ginger-beer again.  Hugh thanked them both; but he did not feel quite comfortable.  He looked at Holt, to find out what he thought: but Holt was quite engrossed with watching the woman untwisting the wire of the first bottle.  The cork did not fly; indeed there was some difficulty in getting it out: so Lamb waived his right, as the eldest, to drink first; and the little boys were so long in settling which should have it, that the little spirit there was had all gone off before Hugh began to drink; and he did not find ginger-beer such particularly good stuff as Lamb had said.  He would have liked a drink of water better.  The next bottle was very brisk: so Lamb seized upon it; and the froth hung round his mouth when he had done: but Holt was no better off with his than Hugh had been.  They were both urged to try their luck again.  Hugh would not: but Holt did once; and Lamb, two or three times. Then the woman offered them some cakes upon a plate: and the little boys thanked her, and took each one.  Lamb put some in his pocket, and advised the others to do the same, as they had no time to spare.  He kept some room in his pocket, however, for some plums; and told the boys that they might carry theirs in their handkerchiefs, or in their caps, if they would take care to have finished before they came within sight of the usher.  He then asked the woman to let them out upon the heath through her garden gate; and she said she certainly would when they had paid.  She then stood drumming with her fingers upon the table, and looking through the window, as if waiting.

"""Come, Proctor, you have half-a-crown,"" said Lamb.  ""Out with it!"" ""My half-crown!"" exclaimed Proctor.  ""You did not say I had anything to pay."" ""As if you did not know that, without my telling you!  You don't think people give away their good things, I suppose!  Come,--where's your half-crown?  My money is all at home."" Holt had nothing with him either.  Lamb asked the woman what there was to pay.  She seemed to count and consider; and Holt told Hugh afterwards that he saw Lamb wink at her.  She then said that the younger gentlemen had had the most plums and cakes.  The charge was a shilling a piece for them, and sixpence for Master Lamb:--half-a-crown exactly.  Hugh protested he never meant anything like this, and that he wanted part of his half-crown to buy a comb with; and he would have emptied out the cakes and fruit he had left; but the woman stopped him, saying that she never took back what she had sold.  Lamb hurried him, too, declaring that their time was up; and he even thrust his finger and thumb into Hugh's inner pocket, and took out the half-crown, which he gave to the woman.  He was sure that Hugh could wait for his comb till Holt paid him, and the woman said she did not see that any more combing was wanted: the young gentleman's hair looked so pretty as it was.  She then showed them through the garden, and gave them each a marigold full-blown.  She unlocked her gate, pushed them through, locked it behind them, and left them to hide their purchases as well as they could.  Though the little boys stuffed their pockets till the ripest plums burst, and wetted the linings, they could not dispose of them all; and they were obliged to give away a good many. Hugh went in search of his new friend, and drew him aside from the rest to relate his trouble.  Dale wondered he had not found out Lamb before this, enough to refuse to follow his lead.  Lamb would never pay a penny.  He always spent the little money he had upon good things, the first day or two; and then he got what he could out of any one who was silly enough to trust him. ""But,"" said Hugh, ""the only thing we had to do with each other before was by my being kind to him."" ""That makes no difference,"" said Dale. ""But what a bad boy he must be!  To be sure, he will pay me, when he knows how much I want a comb."" ""He will tell you to buy it out of your five shillings.  You let him know you had five shillings in Mrs Watson's hands."" ""Yes; but he knows how I mean to spend that,--for presents to carry home at Christmas.  But I'll never tell him anything again.  Oh!  Dale!  Do you really think he will never pay me?"" ""He never pays anybody; that is all I know.  Come,--forget it all, as fast as you can.  Let us go and see if we can get any nuts."" Hugh did not at all succeed in his endeavours to forget his adventure. The more he thought about it, the worse it seemed; and the next time he spoke to Holt, and told him to remember that he owed him a shilling, Holt said he did not know that,--he did not mean to spend a shilling; and it was clear that it was only his fear of Hugh's speaking to Mrs Watson or the usher, that prevented his saying outright that he should not pay it.  Hugh felt very hot, and bit his lip to make his voice steady when he told Dale, on the way home, that he did not believe he should ever see any part of his half-crown again.  Dale thought so too; but he advised him to do nothing more than keep the two debtors up to the remembrance of their debt.  If he told so powerful a person as Firth, it would be almost as much tale-telling as if he went to the master at once; and Hugh himself had no inclination to expose his folly to Phil, who was already quite sufficiently ashamed of his inexperience. So poor Hugh threw the last of his plums to some cottager's children on the green, in his way home; and, when he set foot within bounds again, he heartily wished that this Saturday afternoon had been rainy too; for any disappointment would have been better than this scrape. While learning his lessons for Monday, he forgot the whole matter; and then he grew merry over the great Saturday night's washing; but after he was in bed, it flashed upon him that he should meet uncle and aunt Shaw in church to-morrow, and they would speak to Phil and him after church; and his uncle might ask after the half-crown.  He determined not to expose his companions, at any rate: but his uncle would be displeased; and this thought was so sad that Hugh cried himself to sleep.  His uncle and aunt were at church the next morning; and Hugh could not forget the ginger-beer, or help watching his uncle: so that, though he tried several times to attend to the sermon; he knew nothing about it when it was done.  His uncle observed in the churchyard that they must have had a fine ramble the day before; but did not say anything about pocket-money.  Neither did he name a day for his nephews to visit him, though he said they must come before the days grew much shorter.  So Hugh thought he had got off very well thus far.  In the afternoon, however, Mrs Watson, who invited him and Holt into her parlour, to look over the pictures in her great Bible, was rather surprised to find how little Hugh could tell her of the sermon, considering how much he had remembered the Sunday before.  She had certainly thought that to-day's sermon had been the simpler, and the more interesting to young people, of the two.  Her conversation with Hugh did him good, however.  It reminded him of his mother's words, and of her expectations from him; and it made him resolve to bear, not only his loss, but any blame which might come upon him silently, and without betraying anybody.  He had already determined, fifty times within the twenty-four hours, never to be so weakly led again, when his own mind was doubtful, as he had felt it all the time from leaving the heath to getting back to it again.  He began to reckon on the Christmas holidays, when he should have five weeks at home, free from the evils of both places,--from lessons with Miss Harold, and from Crofton scrapes. It is probable that the whole affair would have passed over quietly, and the woman in the lane might have made large profits by other inexperienced boys, and Mr Carnaby might have gone on being careless as to where the boys went out of his sight on Saturdays, but that Tom Holt ate too many plums on the present occasion.  On Sunday morning he was not well; and was so ill by the evening, and all Monday, that he had to be regularly nursed; and when he left his bed, he was taken to Mrs Watson's parlour,--the comfortable, quiet place where invalid boys enjoyed themselves.  Poor Holt was in very low spirits; and Mrs Watson was so kind that he could not help telling her that he owed a shilling, and he did not know how he should ever pay it; and that Hugh Proctor, who had been his friend till now, seemed on a sudden much more fond of Dale; and this made it harder to be in debt to him. The wet, smeared lining of the pockets had told Mrs Watson already that there had been some improper indulgence in good things; and when she heard what part Lamb had played towards the little boys, she thought it right to tell Mr Tooke.  Mr Tooke said nothing till Holt was in the school again, which was on Thursday; and not then till the little boys had said their lessons, at past eleven o'clock.  They were drawing on their slates, and Lamb was still mumbling over his book, without getting on, when the master's awful voice was heard, calling up before him Lamb, little Proctor, and Holt.  All three started, and turned red; so that the school concluded them guilty before it was known what they were charged with.  Dale knew,--and he alone; and very sorry he was, for the intimacy between Hugh and him had grown very close indeed since Saturday. The master was considerate towards the younger boys.  He made Lamb tell the whole.  Even when the cowardly lad ""bellowed"" (as his school-fellows called his usual mode of crying) so that nothing else could be heard, Mr Tooke waited, rather than question the other two.  When the whole story was extracted, in all its shamefulness, from Lamb's own lips, the master expressed his disgust.  He said nothing about the money part of it--about how Hugh was to be paid.  He probably thought it best for the boys to take the consequences of their folly in losing their money.  He handed the little boys over to Mr Carnaby to be caned--""To make them remember,"" as he said; though they themselves were pretty sure they should never forget.  Lamb was kept to be punished by the master himself.  Though Lamb knew he should be severely flogged, and though he was the most cowardly boy in the school, he did not suffer so much as Hugh did in the prospect of being caned--being punished at all.  Phil, who knew his brother's face well, saw, as he passed down the room, how miserable he was--too miserable to cry; and Phil pulled him by the sleeve, and whispered that being caned was nothing to mind--only a stroke or two across the shoulders.  Hugh shook his head, as much as to say, ""It is not that.""
