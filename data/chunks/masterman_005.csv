"Sailors are never discouraged by danger as long as they have any chance of relieving themselves by their own exertions.  The loss of their shipmates, so instantaneously summoned away,--the wrecked state of the vessel,--the wild surges burying them beneath their angry waters,--the howling of the wind, the dazzling of the lightning, and the pealing of the thunder, did not prevent them from doing what their necessity demanded.  Mackintosh, the first mate, rallied the men, and contrived to fix a block and strap to the still smoking stump of the foremast; a rope was rove through the block, and the main-topgallant sail hoisted, so that the vessel might run faster before the gale, and answer her helm better than she did. The ship was again before the wind, and comparatively safe, notwithstanding the heavy blows she now received from the pursuing waves.  Night again came on, but there was no repose, and the men were worn out with exposure and fatigue. The third day of the gale dawned, but the appearances were as alarming as ever: the continual breaking of the seas over the stern had washed away the binnacles, and it was impossible now to be certain of the course the ship had been steered, or the distance which had been run; the leaky state of the vessel proved how much she had already suffered from the violent shocks which she had received, and the certainty was apparent, that if the weather did not abate, she could not possibly withstand the force of the waves much longer. The countenance of Captain Osborn showed great anxiety: he had a heavy responsibility on his shoulders--he might lose a valuable ship, and still more valuable cargo, even if they did not all lose their lives; for they were now approaching where the sea was studded with low coral islands, upon which they might be thrown by the waves and wind, without having the slightest power to prevent it in their present disabled condition. Ready was standing by him when Captain Osborn said-- ""I don't much like this, Ready; we are now running on danger and have no help for it."" ""That's true enough,"" replied Ready: ""we have no help for it; it is God's will, sir, and His will be done."" ""Amen!"" replied Captain Osborn solemnly; and then he continued, after a pause, ""There were many captains who envied me when I obtained command of this fine ship,--would they change with me now?"" ""I should rather think not, Captain Osborn, but you never know what the day may bring forth.  You sailed with this vessel, full of hope--you now, not without reason, feel something approaching to despair; but who knows? it may please the Almighty to rebuke those angry winds and waves, and to-morrow we may again hope for the best; at all events you have done your duty--no man can do more."" ""You are right,"" replied Captain Osborn; ""but hold hard, Ready, that sea's aboard of us."" Ready had just time to cling with both hands to the belaying-pins when the sea poured over the vessel, with a volume of water which for some time swept them off their legs: they clung on firmly, and at last recovered their feet. ""She started a timber or two with that blow, I rather think,"" said Ready. ""I'm afraid so; the best vessel ever built could not stand such shocks long,"" replied Captain Osborn; ""and at present, with our weak crew, I do not see that we can get more sail upon her."" All that night the ship flew in darkness before the gale.  At daybreak the wind abated, and the sea went down: the ship was, however, still kept before the wind, for she had suffered too much to venture to put her broadside to the sea.  Preparations were now made for getting up jury-masts; and the worn-out seamen were busily employed, under the direction of Captain Osborn and his two mates, when Mr Seagrave and William came upon deck. William stared about him: he perceived, to his astonishment, that the tall masts, with all their rigging and sails, had disappeared, and that the whole deck was in a state of confusion and disorder. ""See, my child,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""the wreck and devastation which are here.  See how the pride of man is humbled before the elements of the great Jehovah."" ""Ay, Master Willy,"" said old Ready, ""look around you, as you well may. Do you remember the verses in the Bible?--if not, I remember them well, for I have often read them, and have often felt the truth of them: `They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.'"" ""But, father,"" said Willy, after a pause, ""how shall we ever get to Sydney without masts or sails?"" ""Why, William,"" replied Ready, ""we must do what we can: we sailors are never much at a loss, and I dare say before night you will find us under some sort of sail again.  We have lost our great masts, so we must put up jury-masts, as we call them; that is, little ones, and little sails upon them; and, if it pleases God, we shall see Sydney yet.  How is Madam, sir?"" continued Ready to Mr Seagrave.  ""Is she better?"" ""I fear she is very weak and ill,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""nothing but fine weather will do her any good.  Do you think that it will be fine now?"" ""Why, sir, to tell you the truth, I fear we shall have more of it yet: I have not given my thoughts to the captain, as I might be mistaken; but still I think so--I've not been fifty years at sea without learning something.  I don't like the gathering of that bank there, Mr Seagrave, and I shouldn't wonder if it were to blow again from the very same quarter, and that before dark."" ""God's will be done,"" replied Mr Seagrave, ""but I am very fearful about my poor wife, who is worn to a shadow."" ""I shouldn't think so much about that, sir, as I really never knew of people dying that way, although they suffer much.  William, do you know that we have lost some of our men since you were down below?"" ""No--I heard the steward say something outside about the foremast."" ""We have lost five of our smartest and best men--Wilson was washed overboard, Fennings and Masters struck dead with the lightning, and Jones and Emery crushed by the fall of the foremast.  You are young, Master Willy, but you cannot think too early of your Maker, or call to mind what they say in the burial service,--`In the midst of life we are in death.'"" ""Thank you, Ready, for the lesson you have given my son,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""and, William, treasure it up in your memory."" ""Yes, William, they are the words of an old man who has seen many and many a one who was full of youth and spirits called away before him, and who is grateful to God that he has been pleased to preserve his life, and allow him to amend his ways."" ""I have been thinking,"" said Mr Seagrave, after a silence of a minute or two, ""that a sailor has no right to marry."" ""I've always thought so, sir,"" replied Ready; ""and I dare say many a poor deserted sailor's wife, when she has listened to the wind and rain in her lonely bed, has thought the same.""
