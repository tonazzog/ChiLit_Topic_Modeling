"CHAPTER 10. THE FOURTH JUNIOR AT HOME. Stephen, before he had been a fortnight in the school, found himself very much at home at Saint Dominic's.  He was not one of those exuberant, irrepressible boys who take their class-fellows by storm, and rise to the top of the tree almost as soon as they touch the bottom. Stephen, as the reader knows, was not a very clever boy, or a very dashing boy, and yet he somehow managed to get his footing among his comrades in the Fourth Junior, and particularly among his fellow Guinea-pigs. He had fought Master Bramble six times in three days during his second week, and was engaged to fight him again every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday during the term.  He had also taken the chair at one indignation meeting against the monitors, and spoken in favour of a resolution at another.  He had distributed brandy-balls in a most handsome manner to his particular adherents, and he had been the means of carrying away no less than two blankets from the next dormitory.  This was pretty good for a fortnight.  Add to this that he had remained steadily at the bottom of his class during the entire period, and that once he had received an ""impot"" (or imposition) from Mr Rastle, and it will easily be understood that he soon gained favour among his fellows. This last cause of celebrity, however, was one which did not please Stephen.  He had come to Saint Dominic's with a great quantity of good resolutions, the chief of which was that he would work hard and keep out of mischief, and it grieved him much to find that in neither aim was he succeeding. The first evening or two he had worked very diligently at preparation. He had taken pains with his fractions, and looked out every word in his Caesar.  He had got Oliver to look over his French, and Loman had volunteered to correct the spelling of his ""theme;"" and yet he stuck at the bottom of the class.  Other boys went up and down.  Some openly boasted that they had had their lessons done for them, and others that they had not done them at all.  A merry time they had of it; but Stephen, down at the bottom, was in dismal dumps.  He could not get up, and he could not get down, and all his honest hard work went for nothing. And so, not content to give that system a longer trial, he grew more lax in his work.  He filched the answers to his sums out of the ""Key,"" and copied his Caesar out of the ""crib.""  It was much easier, and the result was the same.  He did not get up, and he could not get down. Oliver catechised him now and then as to his progress, and received vague answers in reply, and Loman never remembered a fag that pestered him less with lessons.  Stephen was, in fact, settling down into the slough of idleness, and would have become an accomplished dunce in time, had not Mr Rastle come to the rescue.  That gentleman caught the new boy in an idle mood, wandering aimlessly down the passage one afternoon. ""Ah, Greenfield, is that you?  Nothing to do, eh?  Come and have tea with me, will you, in my room?"" Stephen, who had bounded as if shot on hearing the master's unexpected voice behind him, turned round and blushed very red, and said ""Thank you,"" and then looked like a criminal just summoned to the gallows. ""That's right, come along;"" and the master took the lad by the arm and marched him off to his room. Here the sight of muffins and red-currant jam, in addition to the ordinary attractions of a tea-table, somewhat revived Stephen's drooping spirits. ""Make yourself comfortable, my boy, while the tea is brewing,"" said Mr Rastle, cheerily.  ""Have you been playing any cricket since you came?"" ""Only a little, sir,"" said Stephen. ""Well, if you only turn out as good a bat as your brother--how well he played in the Alphabet Match!"" Stephen was reviving fast now, and embarked on a lively chat about his favourite sport, by the end of which the tea was brewed, and he and Mr Rastle sitting ""cheek by jowl"" at the table, with the muffins and jam between them. Presently Mr Rastle steered the talk round to Stephen's home, a topic even more delightful than cricket.  The boy launched out into a full account of the old house and his mother, till the tears very nearly stood in his eyes and the muffins very nearly stuck in his throat.  Mr Rastle listened to it all with a sympathetic smile, throwing in questions now and then which it charmed the boy to answer. ""And how do you like Saint Dominic's?"" presently inquired the master. ""I suppose you've made plenty of friends by this time?"" ""Oh yes, sir.  It's not as slow as it was at first."" ""That's right.  You'll soon get to feel at home.  And how do you think you are getting on in class?"" Stephen was astonished at this question.  If any one knew how he was getting on in class Mr Rastle did, and, alas!  Mr Rastle must know well enough that Stephen was getting on badly. ""Not very well, I'm afraid, sir, thank you,"" replied the boy, not feeling exactly comfortable. ""Not?  That's a pity.  Are the lessons too hard for you?"" kindly inquired Mr Rastle. ""No, I don't think so--that is--no, they're not, sir."" ""Ah, your Latin exercise I thought was very fair in parts to-day."" Stephen stared at his master, and the master looked very pleasantly at Stephen. ""I copied it off Raddleston,"" said the boy, in a trembling voice, and mentally resigning himself to his fate. ""Ah!"" said Mr Rastle, laughing; ""it's a funny thing, now, Greenfield, I knew that myself.  No two boys could possibly have translated `nobody' into `_nullus corpus_' without making common cause!"" Stephen was desperately perplexed.  He had expected a regular row on the head of his confession, and here was his master cracking jokes about the affair! ""I'm very sorry I did it.  I won't do it again,"" said he.  ""That's right, my boy; Raddleston isn't infallible.  Much better do it yourself. I venture to say, now, you can tell me what the Latin for `nobody' is without a dictionary."" ""_Nemo_,"" promptly replied Stephen. ""Of course! and therefore if you had done the exercise yourself you wouldn't have made that horrid--that fearful mistake!"" Stephen said, ""Yes, sir,"" and meditated. ""Come now,"" said Mr Rastle, cheerily, ""I'm not going to scold you.  But if you take my advice you will try and do the next exercise by yourself. Of course you can't expect to be perfect all at once, but if you always copy off Raddleston, do you see, you'll _never_ get on at all."" ""I'll try, sir,"" said Stephen, meaning what he said. ""I know you will, my boy.  It's not easy work to begin with, but it's easier far in the long run.  Try, and if you have difficulties, as you are sure to have, come to me.  I'm always here in the evenings, and we'll hammer it out between us.  School will not be without its temptations, and you will find it hard always to do your duty.  Yet you have, I hope, learnt the power of prayer; and surely the Saviour is able not only to forgive us our sins, but also to keep us from falling.  At school, my boy, as elsewhere, it is a safe rule, whenever one is in doubt, to avoid everything, no matter who may be the tempter, of which one cannot fearlessly speak to one's father or mother, and above all to our Heavenly Father.  Don't be afraid of Him--He will always be ready to help you and to guide you with His Holy Spirit.  Have another cup of tea?"" This little talk, much as he missed at the time its deeper meaning, saved Stephen from becoming a dunce.  He still blundered and boggled over his lessons, and still kept pretty near to the bottom form in his class, but he felt that his master had an interest in him, and that acted like magic to his soul.  He declined Master Raddleston's professional assistance for the future, and did the best he could by himself.  He now and then, though hesitatingly, availed himself of Mr Rastle's offer, and took his difficulties to head-quarters; and he always, when he did so, found the master ready and glad to help, and not only that, but to explain as he went along, and clear the way of future obstacles of the same sort.
