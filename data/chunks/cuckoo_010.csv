"CHAPTER X. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON.      ""That after supper time has come,       And silver dews the meadow steep.     And all is silent in the home,       And even nurses are asleep,     That be it late, or be it soon,     Upon this lovely night in June     They both will step into the moon.""  ""Very well,"" said the cuckoo. ""You would like to look about you a little on the way, perhaps, Griselda, as we shall not be going down chimneys, or anything of that kind just at present."" ""Yes,"" said Griselda. ""I think I should. I'm rather tired of shutting my eyes, and I'm getting quite accustomed to flying about with you, cuckoo."" ""Turn on your side, then,"" said the cuckoo, ""and you won't have to twist your neck to see over my shoulder. Are you comfortable now? And, by-the-by, as you may be cold, just feel under my left wing. You'll find the feather mantle there, that you had on once before. Wrap it round you. I tucked it in at the last moment, thinking you might want it."" ""Oh, you dear, kind cuckoo!"" cried Griselda. ""Yes, I've found it. I'll tuck it all round me like a rug--that's it. I _am_ so warm now, cuckoo."" ""Here goes, then,"" said the cuckoo, and off they set. Had ever a little girl such a flight before? Floating, darting, gliding, sailing--no words can describe it. Griselda lay still in delight, gazing all about her. ""How lovely the stars are, cuckoo!"" she said. ""Is it true they're all great, big _suns_? I'd rather they weren't. I like to think of them as nice, funny little things."" ""They're not all suns,"" said the cuckoo. ""Not all those you're looking at now."" ""I like the twinkling ones best,"" said Griselda. ""They look so good-natured. Are they _all_ twirling about always, cuckoo? Mr. Kneebreeches has just begun to teach me astronomy, and _he_ says they are; but I'm not at all sure that he knows much about it."" ""He's quite right all the same,"" replied the cuckoo. ""Oh dear me! How tired they must be, then!"" said Griselda. ""Do they never rest just for a minute?"" ""Obeying orders,"" replied the cuckoo. Griselda gave a little wriggle. ""What's the use of it?"" she said. ""It would be just as nice if they stood still now and then."" ""Would it?"" said the cuckoo. ""I know some body who would soon find fault if they did. What would you say to no summer; no day, or no night, whichever it happened not to be, you see; nothing growing, and nothing to eat before long? That's what it would be if they stood still, you see, because----"" ""Thank you, cuckoo,"" interrupted Griselda. ""It's very nice to hear you--I mean, very dreadful to think of, but I don't want you to explain. I'll ask Mr. Kneebreeches when I'm at my lessons. You might tell me one thing, however. What's at the other side of the moon?"" ""There's a variety of opinions,"" said the cuckoo. ""What are they? Tell me the funniest."" ""Some say all the unfinished work of the world is kept there,"" said the cuckoo. ""_That's_ not funny,"" said Griselda. ""What a messy place it must be! Why, even _my_ unfinished work makes quite a heap. I don't like that opinion at all, cuckoo. Tell me another."" ""I _have_ heard,"" said the cuckoo, ""that among the places there you would find the country of the little black dogs. You know what sort of creatures those are?"" ""Yes, I suppose so,"" said Griselda, rather reluctantly. ""There are a good many of them in this world, as of course you know,"" continued the cuckoo. ""But up there, they are much worse than here. When a child has made a great pet of one down here, I've heard tell the fairies take him up there when his parents and nurses think he's sleeping quietly in his bed, and make him work hard all night, with his own particular little black dog on his back. And it's so dreadfully heavy--for every time he takes it on his back down here it grows a pound heavier up there--that by morning the child is quite worn out. I dare say you've noticed how haggard and miserable some ill-tempered children get to look--now you'll know the reason."" ""Thank you, cuckoo,"" said Griselda again; ""but I can't say I like this opinion about the other side of the moon any better than the first. If you please, I would rather not talk about it any more."" ""Oh, but it's not so bad an idea after all,"" said the cuckoo. ""Lots of children, they say, get quite cured in the country of the little black dogs. It's this way--for every time a child refuses to take the dog on his back down here it grows a pound lighter up there, so at last any sensible child learns how much better it is to have nothing to say to it at all, and gets out of the way of it, you see. Of course, there _are_ children whom nothing would cure, I suppose. What becomes of them I really can't say. Very likely they get crushed into pancakes by the weight of the dogs at last, and then nothing more is ever heard of them."" ""Horrid!"" said Griselda, with a shudder. ""Don't let's talk about it any more, cuckoo; tell me your _own_ opinion about what there really is on the other side of the moon."" The cuckoo was silent for a moment. Then suddenly he stopped short in the middle of his flight. ""Would you like to see for yourself, Griselda?"" he said. ""There would be about time to do it,"" he added to himself, ""and it would fulfil her other wish, too."" ""See the moon for myself, do you mean?"" cried Griselda, clasping her hands. ""I should rather think I would. Will you really take me there, cuckoo?"" ""To the other side,"" said the cuckoo. ""I couldn't take you to this side."" ""Why not? Not that I'd care to go to this side as much as to the other; for, of course, we can _see_ this side from here. But I'd like to know why you couldn't take me there."" ""For _reasons_,"" said the cuckoo drily. ""I'll give you one if you like. If I took you to this side of the moon you wouldn't be yourself when you got there."" ""Griselda,"" said the cuckoo, ""I told you once that there are a great many things you don't know. Now, I'll tell you something more. There are a great many things you're not _intended_ to know."" ""Very well,"" said Griselda. ""But do tell me when you're going on again, and where you are going to take me to. There's no harm my asking that?"" ""No,"" said the cuckoo. ""I'm going on immediately, and I'm going to take you where you wanted to go to, only you must shut your eyes again, and lie perfectly still without talking, for I must put on steam--a good deal of steam--and I can't talk to you. Are you all right?"" ""All right,"" said Griselda. She had hardly said the words when she seemed to fall asleep. The rushing sound in the air all round her increased so greatly that she was conscious of nothing else. For a moment or two she tried to remember where she was, and where she was going, but it was useless. She forgot everything, and knew nothing more of what was passing till--till she heard the cuckoo again. ""Cuckoo, cuckoo; wake up, Griselda,"" he said. Griselda sat up. Not certainly where she had been when she went to sleep. Not on the cuckoo's back, for there he was standing beside her, as tiny as usual. Either he had grown little again, or she had grown big--which, she supposed, it did not much matter. Only it was very queer! ""Where am I, cuckoo?"" she said. ""Where you wished to be,"" he replied. ""Look about you and see."" Griselda looked about her. What did she see? Something that I can only give you a faint idea of, children; something so strange and unlike what she had ever seen before, that only in a dream could you see it as Griselda saw it. And yet _why_ it seemed to her so strange and unnatural I cannot well explain; if I could, my words would be as good as pictures, which I know they are not. After all, it was only the sea she saw; but such a great, strange, silent sea, for there were no waves. Griselda was seated on the shore, close beside the water's edge, but it did not come lapping up to her feet in the pretty, coaxing way that _our_ sea does when it is in a good humour. There were here and there faint ripples on the surface, caused by the slight breezes which now and then came softly round Griselda's face, but that was all. King Canute might have sat ""from then till now"" by this still, lifeless ocean without the chance of reading his silly attendants a lesson--if, indeed, there ever were such silly people, which I very much doubt.
