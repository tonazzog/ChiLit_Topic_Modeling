" For two or three days, Mr. Campbell was very busy making out an inventory of the articles which he required. His funds at Quebec were rather low, but the communication which his agent had made to him of Mr. D. Campbell's intention of paying for the green-house and hot-house plants, made him feel very easy on that score; and he now determined to procure a small flock of sheep, and one or two of the Canadian ponies or galloways, as they would soon be required for the farm, as well as two carts or light wagons used in the country. In the meantime, Alfred, Martin, and Henry were very busy putting the seed in between the stumps of the felled timber, merely hoeing up the earth and raking it in, which was all that was required. The quantity of land cleared was about twelve acres, half of which was sowed with oats, and the other with wheat; the piece cleared on the other side of the stream by Malachi Bone, and railed in, was sown with maize, or Indian corn. As soon as the seed was in, they all set to putting up a high fence round the cleared land, which was done with split rails made from the white cedar, which grew in a swamp about half a mile distant, and which, it may be remembered, had in a great measure been provided by the soldiers who had been lent to assist them on their arrival. The piece of prairie land, on the side of the stream next to the house, was put apart for an early crop of hay, and as soon as they could, they intended to turn the cows into the bush, that is, to feed in the forest, that they might obtain hay from the other side, which had belonged to Malachi; but the prairie required to be fenced in, and this was the job that they took in hand as soon as the seeds were sown. ""I hope, when the Colonel comes over,"" observed Martin to Alfred, ""that we shall persuade him to let us have some soldiers this summer, for we shall want them both for the fencing and getting the hay-crop in. Our summers are not very long, and there is plenty to do."" ""I think my father intends to make the request,"" replied Alfred. ""Ah, sir; he will now see the value of this bit of prairie land to a new settler; instead of having to go in search of hay, as they must do at the fort now, we have plenty for hay, and plenty for feed. So we are to have some sheep, I find?"" ""Yes, and I suppose we must build a winter-yard for them."" ""To be sure we must, for the wolves are very partial to mutton; I think, on the whole, that they like pigs better. I wish we could get the fence up round the prairie, but that we never can do this year without we have help from the fort."" ""But will it be safe to turn the cows into the bush?"" ""Oh yes, sir; they will not be hurt by any thing in the summer time; sometimes we have trouble to find them again, but not when they have calves; they are certain to come home every evening to their young ones."" ""We shall have quite a herd of cattle; eight calves and eight cows."" ""We must only bring up the cow calves, unless your father intends to have oxen for the yoke. We shall require them about the time they are fit to break in, that is, in two or three years."" ""Yes, we shall be great farmers by and by,"" replied Alfred with a sigh; for at the moment he was thinking of Captain Lumley and his nautical profession. In the evening of the day on which this conversation took place, Malachi Bone was requested to resume his observations upon the beavers. ""Well, ma'am, as I said the other night, as soon as they have dammed up the river and made the lake, they then build their houses; and how they manage to work under water and fix the posts in the ground is a puzzle to me, but they do fix six posts in the ground, and very firmly, and then they build their house, which is very curious; it is in the form of a large oven, and made of clay and fat earth, mixed up with branches and herbs of all sorts; they have three sets of rooms, one above the other, so that if the water rises from a freshet or sudden thaw, they may be able to move higher and keep themselves dry. Each beaver has his own little room, and the entrance is made under the water, so that they dive down to go into it, and nothing can harm them."" ""How very curious! and what do they live upon? Malachi?"" ""The bark of what we call asp-wood, ma'am, which is a kind of sallow; they lay up great quantities of it in the autumn as a provision for winter, when they are frozen up for some months."" ""Well, but how do you take them, Malachi?"" ""There are many ways, ma'am; sometimes the Indians break down the dam, and let off the water, and then they kill them all except a dozen of the females and half a dozen males; after which they stop up the dam again, that the animals may breed and increase; sometimes, when the beaver lake is frozen hard, they break into the beaver house from the top; when they do that, the beavers all dive and escape, but as they must come up to breathe at the holes in the ice, they place nets and take them in that way, but they always leave a sufficient number to keep up the stock; they also take them in traps baited with the asp-wood; but that is more difficult. ""But there is another sort of beaver, ma'am, called the land-beaver, which is more easily taken,"" observed Martin; ""they make holes in the earth like rabbits. The Indians say that these beavers are those who are lazy and idle, and have been driven out by the others for not working."" ""Now, tell us what you do when you go out to hunt the beaver in the winter, Malachi?"" ""We never hunt the beaver only, ma'am; we go out to hunt every thing; we go to the beaver lakes, and then we set our traps for beaver, otter, martin, minks, cats, foxes, and every other animal, some traps large and some small. We build our hut, and set our traps all about us, and examine them every day; we cut what flesh is good, and we employ ourselves skinning the animals which we take."" ""Is the beaver flesh good?"" ""Yes, ma'am, very tolerable eating; perhaps the best we find at that time."" ""But what a miserable life that must be,"" said Mrs. Campbell. ""Well, ma'am, you may think so, but we hunters think otherwise,"" replied Malachi; ""we are used to it, and to being left alone to our own thoughts."" ""That's true,"" observed Martin; ""I'd rather pass the winter hunting beavers, than pass it at Quebec, miserable as you may imagine the life to be."" ""There must be a charm in the life, that is certain,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""for how many are engaged in it who go out year after year, and never think of laying up any of their earnings."" ""Very true, sir,"" replied Martin; ""what they make from their skins is spent as soon as they get to Quebec, as I know well, and then they set off again.""
