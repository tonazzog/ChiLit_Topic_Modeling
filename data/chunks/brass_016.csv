" Fortunately for Ventimore, the momentary dismay he had felt on finding himself deserted by his unfathomable Jinnee at the very outset of the ceremony passed unnoticed, as the Prime Warden of the Candlestick-makers' Company immediately came to his rescue by briefly introducing him to the Lord Mayor, who, with dignified courtesy, had descended to the lowest step of the dais to receive him. ""Mr. Ventimore,"" said the Chief Magistrate, cordially, as he pressed Horace's hand, ""you must allow me to say that I consider this one of the greatest privileges--if not _the_ greatest privilege--that have fallen to my lot during a term of office in which I have had the honour of welcoming more than the usual number of illustrious visitors."" ""My Lord Mayor,"" said Horace, with absolute sincerity, ""you really overwhelm me. I--I only wish I could feel that I had done anything to deserve this--this magnificent compliment!"" ""Ah!"" replied the Lord Mayor, in a paternally rallying tone. ""Modest, my dear sir, I perceive. Like all truly great men! A most admirable trait! Permit me to present you to the Sheriffs."" The Sheriffs appeared highly delighted. Horace shook hands with both of them; indeed, in the flurry of the moment he very nearly offered to do so with the Sword and Mace bearers as well, but their hands were, as it happened, otherwise engaged. ""The actual presentation,"" said the Lord Mayor, ""takes place in the Great Hall, as you are doubtless aware."" ""I--I have been given to understand so,"" said Horace, with a sinking heart--for he had begun to hope that the worst was over. ""But before we adjourn,"" said his host, ""you will let me tempt you to partake of some slight refreshment--just a snack?"" Horace was not hungry, but it occurred to him that he might get through the ceremony with more credit after a glass of champagne; so he accepted the invitation, and was conducted to an extemporised buffet at one end of the Library, where he fortified himself for the impending ordeal with a _caviare_ sandwich and a bumper of the driest champagne in the Corporation cellars. ""They talk of abolishing us,"" said the Lord Mayor, as he took an anchovy on toast; ""but I maintain, Mr. Ventimore--I maintain that we, with our ancient customs, our time-honoured traditions, form a link with the past, which a wise statesman will preserve, if I may employ a somewhat vulgar term, untinkered with."" Horace agreed, remembering a link with a far more ancient past with which he devoutly wished he had refrained from tinkering. ""Talking of ancient customs,"" the Lord Mayor continued, with an odd blend of pride and apology, ""you will shortly have an illustration of our antiquated procedure, which may impress you as quaint."" Horace, feeling absolutely idiotic, murmured that he felt sure it would do that. ""Before presenting you for the freedom, the Prime Warden and five officials of the Candlestick-makers' Company will give their testimony as compurgators in your favour, making oath that you are 'a man of good name and fame,' and that (you will be amused at this, Mr. Ventimore)--that you 'do desire the freedom of this city, whereby to defraud the Queen or the City.' Ha, ha! Curious way of putting it, is it not?"" ""Very,"" said Horace, guiltily, and not a little concerned on the official's account. ""A mere form!"" said the Lord Mayor; ""but I for one, Mr. Ventimore--I for one should be sorry to see the picturesque old practices die out. To my mind,"" he added, as he finished a _pâté de foie gras_ sandwich, ""the modern impatience to sweep away all the ancient landmarks (whether they be superannuated or not) is one of the most disquieting symptoms of the age. You won't have any more champagne? Then I think we had better be making our way to the Great Hall for the Event of the Day."" ""I'm afraid,"" said Horace, with a sudden consciousness of his incongruously Oriental attire--""I'm afraid this is not quite the sort of dress for such a ceremony. If I had known----"" ""Now, don't say another word!"" said the Lord Mayor. ""Your costume is very nice--very nice indeed, and--and most appropriate, I am sure. But I see the City Marshal is waiting for us to head the procession. Shall we lead the way?"" The band struck up the March of the Priests from _Athalie_, and Horace, his head in a whirl, walked with his host, followed by the City Lands Committee, the Sheriffs, and other dignitaries, through the Art Gallery and into the Great Hall, where their entrance was heralded by a flourish of trumpets. The Hall was crowded, and Ventimore found himself the object of a popular demonstration which would have filled him with joy and pride if he could only have felt that he had done anything whatever to justify it, for it was ridiculous to suppose that he had rendered himself a public benefactor by restoring a convicted Jinnee to freedom and society generally. His only consolation was that the English are a race not given to effusiveness without very good reason, and that before the ceremony was over he would be enabled to gather what were the particular services which had excited such unbounded enthusiasm. Meanwhile he stood there on the crimson-draped and flower-bedecked dais, bowing repeatedly, and trusting that he did not look so forlornly foolish as he felt. A long shaft of sunlight struck down between the Gothic rafters, and dappled the brown stone walls with patches of gold; the electric lights in the big hooped chandeliers showed pale and feeble against the subdued glow of the stained glass; the air was heavy with the scent of flowers and essences. Then there was a rustle of expectation in the audience, and a pause, in which it seemed to Horace that everybody on the dais was almost as nervous and at a loss what to do next as he was himself. He wished with all his soul that they would hurry the ceremony through, anyhow, and let him go. At length the proceedings began by a sort of solemn affectation of having merely met there for the ordinary business of the day, which to Horace just then seemed childish in the extreme; it was resolved that ""items 1 to 4 on the agenda need not be discussed,"" which brought them to item 5. Item 5 was a resolution, read by the Town Clerk, that ""the freedom of the City should be presented to Horace Ventimore, Esq., Citizen and Candlestick-maker"" (which last Horace was not aware of being, but supposed vaguely that it had been somehow managed while he was at the buffet in the Library), ""in recognition of his services""--the resolution ran, and Horace listened with all his ears--""especially in connection with ..."" It was most unfortunate--but at this precise point the official was seized with an attack of coughing, in which all was lost but the conclusion of the sentence, "" ... that have justly entitled him to the gratitude and admiration of his fellow-countrymen."" Then the six compurgators came forward and vouched for Ventimore's fitness to receive the freedom. He had painful doubts whether they altogether understood what a responsibility they were undertaking--but it was too late to warn them and he could only trust that they knew more of their business than he did. After this the City Chamberlain read him an address, to which Horace listened in resigned bewilderment. The Chamberlain referred to the unanimity and enthusiasm with which the resolution had been carried, and said that it was his pleasing and honourable duty, as the mouthpiece of that ancient City, to address what he described with some inadequacy as ""a few words"" to one by adding whose name to their roll of freemen the Corporation honoured rather themselves than the recipient of their homage.

"It was flattering, but to Horace's ear the phrases sounded excessive, almost fulsome--though, of course, that depended very much on what he had done, which he had still to ascertain. The orator proceeded to read him the ""Illustrious List of London's Roll of Fame,"" a recital which made Horace shiver with apprehension. For what names they were! What glorious deeds they had performed! How was it possible that he--plain Horace Ventimore, a struggling architect who had missed his one great chance--could have achieved (especially without even being aware of it) anything that would not seem ludicrously insignificant by comparison? He had a morbid fancy that the marble goddesses, or whoever they were, at the base of Nelson's monument opposite, were regarding him with stony disdain and indignation; that the statue of Wellington knew him for an arrant impostor, and averted his head with cold contempt; and that the effigy of Lord Mayor Beckford on the right of the dais would come to life and denounce him in another moment. ""Turning now to your own distinguished services,"" he suddenly heard the City Chamberlain resuming, ""you are probably aware, sir, that it is customary on these occasions to mention specifically the particular merit which had been deemed worthy of civic recognition."" Horace was greatly relieved to hear it, for it struck him as a most sensible and, in his own particular case, essential formality. ""But, on the present occasion, sir,"" proceeded the speaker, ""I feel, as all present must feel, that it would be unnecessary--nay, almost impertinent--were I to weary the public ear by a halting recapitulation of deeds with which it is already so appreciatively familiar."" At this he was interrupted by deafening and long-continued applause, at the end of which he continued: ""I have only therefore, to greet you in the name of the Corporation, and to offer you the right hand of fellowship as a Freeman, and Citizen, and Candlestick-maker of London."" As he shook hands he presented Horace with a copy of the Oath of Allegiance, intimating that he was to read it aloud. Naturally, Ventimore had not the least objection to swear to be good and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria, or to be obedient to the Lord Mayor, and warn him of any conspiracies against the Queen's peace which might chance to come under his observation; so he took the oath cheerfully enough, and hoped that this was really the end of the ceremony. However, to his great chagrin and apprehension, the Lord Mayor rose with the evident intention of making a speech. He said that the conclusion of the City to bestow the highest honour in their gift upon Mr. Horace Ventimore had been--here he hesitated--somewhat hastily arrived at. Personally, he would have liked a longer time to prepare, to make the display less inadequate to, and worthier of, this exceptional occasion. He thought that was the general feeling. (It evidently was, judging from the loud and unanimous cheering). However, for reasons which--for reasons with which they were as well acquainted as himself, the notice had been short. The Corporation had yielded (as they always did, as it would always be their pride and pleasure to yield) to popular pressure which was practically irresistible, and had done the best they could in the limited--he might almost say the unprecedentedly limited--period allowed them. The proudest leaf in Mr. Ventimore's chaplet of laurels to-day was, he would venture to assert, the sight of the extraordinary enthusiasm and assemblage, not only in that noble hall, but in the thoroughfares of this mighty Metropolis. Under the circumstances, this was a marvellous tribute to the admiration and affection which Mr. Ventimore had succeeded in inspiring in the great heart of the people, rich and poor, high and low. He would not detain his hearers any longer; all that remained for him to do was to ask Mr. Ventimore's acceptance of a golden casket containing the roll of freedom, and he felt sure that their distinguished guest, before proceeding to inscribe his name on the register, would oblige them all by some account from his own lips of--of the events in which he had figured so prominently and so creditably. Horace received the casket mechanically; there was a universal cry of ""Speech!"" from the audience, to which he replied by shaking his head in helpless deprecation--but in vain; he found himself irresistibly pressed towards the rail in front of the dais, and the roar of applause which greeted him saved him from all necessity of attempting to speak for nearly two minutes. During that interval he had time to clear his brain and think what he had better do or say in his present unenviable dilemma. For some time past a suspicion had been growing in his mind, until it had now almost swollen into certainty. He felt that, before he compromised himself, or allowed his too generous entertainers to compromise themselves irretrievably, it was absolutely necessary to ascertain his real position, and, to do that, he must make some sort of speech. With this resolve, all his nervousness and embarrassment and indecision melted away; he faced the assembly coolly and gallantly, convinced that his best alternative now lay in perfect candour. ""My Lord Mayor, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,"" he began, in a clear voice which penetrated to the farthest gallery and commanded instant attention. ""If you expect to hear from me any description of what I've done to be received like this, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. For my own belief is that I've done nothing whatever."" There was a general outcry of ""No, no!"" at this, and a fervid murmur of protest. ""It's all very well to say 'No, no,'"" said Horace, ""and I am extremely grateful to you all for the interruption. Still, I can only repeat that I am absolutely unaware of having ever rendered my Country, or this great City, a single service deserving of the slightest acknowledgment. I wish I could feel I had--but the truth is that, if I have, the fact has entirely slipped from my memory."" Again there were murmurs, this time with a certain under-current of irritation; and he could hear the Lord Mayor behind him remarking to the City Chamberlain that this was not at all the kind of speech for the occasion. ""I know what you're thinking,"" said Horace. ""You're thinking this is mock modesty on my part. But it's nothing of the sort. _I_ don't know what I've done--but I presume you are all better informed. Because the Corporation wouldn't have given me that very charming casket--you wouldn't all of you be here like this--unless you were under a strong impression that I'd done _something_ to deserve it."" At this there was a fresh outburst of applause. ""Just so,"" said Horace, calmly. ""Well, now, will any of you be kind enough to tell me, in a few words, _what_ you suppose I've done?"" There was a dead silence, in which every one looked at his or her neighbour and smiled feebly. ""My Lord Mayor,"" continued Horace, ""I appeal to you to tell me and this distinguished assembly why on earth we're all here!"" The Lord Mayor rose. ""I think it sufficient to say,"" he announced with dignity, ""that the Corporation and myself were unanimously of opinion that this distinction should be awarded--for reasons which it is unnecessary and--hum--ha--invidious to enter into here."" ""I am sorry,"" persisted Horace, ""but I must press your lordship for those reasons. I have an object.... Will the City Chamberlain oblige me, then?... No? Well, then, the Town Clerk?... No?--it's just as I suspected: none of you can give me your reasons, and shall I tell you why? Because there _aren't_ any.... Now, do bear with me for a moment. I'm quite aware this is very embarrassing for all of you--but remember that it's infinitely more awkward for _me_! I really cannot accept the freedom of the City under any suspicion of false pretences. It would be a poor reward for your hospitality, and base and unpatriotic into the bargain, to depreciate the value of so great a distinction by permitting it to be conferred unworthily. If, after you've heard what I am going to tell you, you still insist on my accepting such an honour, of course I will not be so ungracious as to refuse it. But I really don't feel that it would be right to inscribe my name on your Roll of Fame without some sort of explanation. If I did, I might, for anything I know, involuntarily be signing the death-warrant of the Corporation!""
