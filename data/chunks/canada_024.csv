" A notice arrived that the departure of the boat to Montreal would take place on the next morning. When the boat came up, it brought Captain Sinclair, to the great delight of the whole party, who had felt very anxious about one with whom they had so long been intimate and who had shown them so much kindness. His knee was almost well, and as soon as the first interrogations were over, he made known to them that he had obtained six weeks' leave of absence, and was about to proceed to Quebec. ""To Quebec!"" cried Emma, ""and why are you going to Quebec?"" ""To confess the truth, Emma,"" said Captain Sinclair, ""my journey to Quebec is but the preparatory step to my return to England for perhaps two or three months."" ""To England! Oh! how I wish--;"" but here Emma stopped; she was going to say how much she wished that she was going also, but her uncle and aunt were present, and, recollecting that it might pain them and induce them to think that she was discontented, she added, ""that you would bring me out all the new fashions."" ""All the new fashions, my dear Emma?"" said Henry. ""Why, do you wish to be fashionably dressed in the woods of Canada?"" ""Why not?"" exclaimed Emma, who felt that she must appear to be very foolish, but could not get out of her scrape. ""I can look at myself in the glass at all events."" ""I will try to bring you out something which will give you pleasure,"" replied Captain Sinclair, ""but as for the fashions, I know you are only joking, by your trusting a person so incompetent as I am to select them."" ""Well, I do not think you would execute my commission very well, so I will not trouble you,"" replied Emma; ""and now let us know why you are going to England."" ""My dear Emma,"" said Mr. Campbell, ""you ought not to put such questions; Captain Sinclair has his own reasons, I have no doubt."" ""It is very true that I have my own reasons,"" replied Captain Sinclair, ""and, as I have no secrets, I will with pleasure gratify Emma's curiosity. I do not know whether you are aware that I was an orphan at a very early age, and have been under the charge of a guardian. When my father died, he left directions in his will that I was not to take possession of my property till I was twenty-five years of age. I was twenty-five years old last year, and my guardian has written requesting me to come home, that he may be relieved of his responsibility, by making over to me the trust which has been confided to him."" ""Will it detain you long?"" inquired Mr. Campbell. ""It must not. It is very difficult to obtain leave of absence from your regiment in time of war. It is only through interest that I do so now. On my arrival at Quebec, the Governor will put me on his staff, and then he will give me leave. I shall not stay longer than is necessary, as I am anxious to be with my regiment again. You may, therefore, be certain that, if I am spared, I shall be with you again before the winter, if not much sooner. So now if you have really any commissions for me to execute, I can only say I shall be most happy to comply with your wishes to the best of my ability."" ""Well,"" observed Emma, ""we really were not aware that Captain Sinclair was a man of fortune. You think now you will come back,"" continued she, gravely, ""but if once you get to England, you will remain, and forget all about Canada."" ""My fortune is not very large,"" replied Captain Sinclair; ""in England, hardly sufficient to induce a young lady of fashion to look upon me, although enough, perhaps, for a sensible woman to be happy upon. My fortune, therefore, will not detain me in England, and, as I said before, my greatest wish is to rejoin my regiment."" ""Whether you come back or remain,"" observed Mr. Campbell, ""you will always have our best wishes, Captain Sinclair. We are not ungrateful for your kindness to us."" ""Nor shall I forget the many happy hours I have passed in your society,"" replied Captain Sinclair; ""but we shall be melancholy if we talk too long upon the subject. The boat can not remain more than two hours, and Henry must be ready by that time. The commandant is anxious that it should start for Montreal this very evening."" ""Then, indeed, we have no time to lose,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""Henry, get your trunk ready, and Martin will take it down into the boat before we sit down to dinner. It will be a long while before we have you to dine with us again,"" continued Mr. Campbell to Captain Sinclair; ""but I wish you your health and much happiness till you return. Come, girls, look after the dinner. Mary! where's Mary?"" ""She went into the room a few minutes ago,"" said Emma, ""but I'm here, and can do all that is required without her or my aunt either. Come, Percival, lay the cloth; Alfred, come and help me, this is almost too heavy for me. Oh, here comes my aunt: now you may go away, Alfred; we can get on better without you."" ""There's gratitude,"" said Alfred, laughing. As Henry had been in daily expectation of the summons, he was not long in his preparations, and in a few minutes made his appearance, accompanied by Mary Percival. They then sat down to dinner, not very cheerful, for Captain Sinclair's unexpected departure had thrown a gloom over them all; however, they rallied a little toward the close of the meal, and Mr. Campbell produced one of his bottles of wine to drink success and happiness to the travelers. It was then time to start. Captain Sinclair and Henry shook hands with Mr. Campbell and the Miss Percivals, and accompanied by the gentlemen of the party, walked down to the beach. ""I can't bear parting with any one that I have been so intimate with,"" said Emma, after they were left alone. ""I declare I could sit down and have a hearty cry at Captain Sinclair's departure."" Mary sighed, but made no answer. ""I am not surprised to hear you say so, Emma,"" said Mrs. Campbell. ""In England, when we were surrounded with friends, parting was always painful; but here where we have so few, I might almost say only Captain Sinclair, it is of course most painful. However, it's only for a time, I hope."" ""It must be very dull to be on duty at the fort,"" said Mary; ""I should not be surprised at Captain Sinclair's not returning."" ""I should be most exceedingly surprised,"" replied Emma; ""I am sure that he will come back, if he is not unavoidably prevented."" ""Since he has expressed so much desire to rejoin his regiment, I should be surprised as well as you, Emma,"" said Mrs. Campbell. ""He is not a volatile young man; but, come, we must clear away the dinner-table."" Mr. Campbell, Alfred, Percival, and Martin soon returned, for Captain Sinclair was obliged to push off immediately, that he might return in time to the fort, in obedience to his orders. Malachi and John had gone out on a hunting expedition, and the Strawberry was at her own lodge. The party that sat in the kitchen in the evening was, therefore, much reduced, and the taking farewell of Captain Sinclair did not dispose them to be very lively. A few words were exchanged now and then, but the conversation drooped. Emma spoke of Captain Sinclair's expectations and projects. ""We never know what may come in this world of change, my dear Emma,"" said Mr. Campbell. ""All Captain Sinclair's plans may be overthrown by circumstances over which he has no control. How seldom do we meet with results equal to our expectations. When I was practicing in my profession, I little expected that I should be summoned to take possession of Wexton Hall; when once in possession, as little did I expect that I should be obliged to quit it, and to come to these desolate wilds. We are in the hands of God, who does with us as He thinks fit. I have been reading this morning, and I made the observation not only how often individuals, but even nations, are out in their expectations. I do not know a more convincing proof of this than the narration of events, which from their recent occurrence, can hardly yet be considered as history, has offered to me. Perhaps there never was so short a period in which causes have produced effects so rapidly, and in which, in every case, the effects have been directly opposite to what short-sighted mortals had anticipated. It was in 1756, scarcely forty years ago, that the French, being in possession of the provinces, attempted to wrest from us those portions of America which we occupied. What was the result? After a war which, for cruelty and atrocity, is perhaps unequaled in history, both parties employing savages, by whom the French and English were alternately tortured and burned to death, France, in attempting to obtain all, lost all, and was compelled, in 1760, to surrender its own provinces to Great Britain. Here is one instance in which affairs turned out contrary to the expectations of France.
