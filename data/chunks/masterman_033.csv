"The next morning was fine, and as soon as breakfast was over, they took the wheels down to the turtle-pond, and Ready having speared one of the largest by means of a pike with a barb to it, which he had made on purpose, they hauled it on shore, slung it under the wheels, and took it up to the house.  Having killed the turtle, and cut it up, Juno, under the directions of Ready, chose such portions as were required for the soup; and when the pot was on the fire, Ready, Mr Seagrave, and William set off with the cross-cut saw and hatchets, to commence felling the cocoa-nut trees for the building of the outhouse, which was to hold their stores, as soon as they could be brought round from the other side of the island. ""I mean this to be our place of refuge in case of danger, sir,"" observed Ready; ""and therefore I have selected this thick part of the wood, as it is not very far from the house, and by cutting the path to it in a zigzag, it will be quite hidden from sight; and we must make the path just wide enough to allow the wheels to pass, and stump up the roots of the trees which we are obliged to cut down, otherwise the stumps would attract attention."" ""I agree with you, Ready,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""there is no saying what may happen."" ""You see, sir, it is often the custom for the natives, in this part of the world, to come in their canoes from one island to another, merely to get cocoa-nuts.  I can't say that the other islands near us are inhabited, but still it is probable, and we cannot tell what the character of the people may be.  I tell you this, but we had better not say a word to Mrs Seagrave, as it may distress her."" Mr Seagrave agreed, and Ready continued: ""We are now near the spot, sir.  You see, when we have got over this hill, where the trees are so very thick, the fall in the ground will assist in the concealment of the building.  I should say we are very near right where we now stand."" ""How far are we now from the house?  We must not be too distant."" ""I reckon we are not 150 yards in a straight line, although the road will, by its turning, make it double the distance."" ""Then I think this spot will do very well."" ""I'll just mark out the trees which are to stand, Mr Seagrave, and those which are to be cut down, so as to leave about four feet of stump standing."" As soon as they had planned the building, the axes and saw were in full use, and tree after tree fell one upon the other.  They worked hard till dinner-time, and were not sorry at the prospect of sitting down to a rich mess of turtle-soup. ""My dear William, and you too, Mr Seagrave, how very warm you are!"" said Mrs Seagrave; ""you must not work so hard."" ""Cutting down trees is very warm work, mother,"" replied William, ""and hard work will never hurt any one, especially when he dines off turtle-soup.  Why, Tommy, what's the matter with you?"" ""Tommy and I are at variance,"" replied Mrs Seagrave.  ""I had my thimble this morning, and had commenced my sewing, when I was called out by Juno, and Caroline went with me, and Tommy was left in the house.  When I came back I found him outside, and on going back to my work, there was no thimble to be found; I asked him if he had touched it, and his answer was that he would look for it.  He did look, and said he could not find it; I have asked him several times if he took it away, and his only answer is that he will find it by and by."" ""Tommy, did you take the thimble?"" said Mr Seagrave, gravely. ""I'll find it by and by, papa."" ""That's not an answer.  Did you take the thimble?"" ""I'll find it by and by, papa,"" said Tommy, whimpering. ""That's all the answer he will give me,"" said Mrs Seagrave. ""Well, then, he shall have no dinner till the thimble makes its appearance,"" replied Mr Seagrave. Master Tommy began to cry at this intelligence.  Juno appeared with the turtle-soup; and Tommy cried louder when they had said grace and commenced their dinner.  They were all very hungry, and William sent his plate for another portion, which he had not commenced long before he put his finger in his mouth and pulled out something. ""Why, mother, here's the thimble in my soup,"" cried William. ""No wonder he said he would find it by and by,"" said Ready, smiling; ""he meant to have fished it up, I suppose, from what was left of the soup after dinner.  Well, Mrs Seagrave, I don't mean to say that Tommy is a good boy, but still, although he would not tell where the thimble was, he has not told a falsehood about it."" ""No, he has not,"" replied William.  ""I think, now that the thimble is found, if he begs pardon, papa will forgive him."" ""Tommy, come here,"" said Mr Seagrave.  ""Tell me why you put that thimble into the soup?"" ""I wanted to taste the soup.  I wanted to fill the thimble; the soup burnt my fingers, and I let the thimble drop in."" ""Well, a thimbleful wasn't much, at all events,"" observed Ready.  ""And why didn't you tell your mamma where the thimble was?"" ""I was afraid mamma throw all the soup away, and then I get none for dinner."" ""Oh! that was it, was it?  Well, sir, I said you should have no dinner till the thimble was found, so, as it is found, you may have your dinner; but if you ever refuse to answer a question again, I shall punish you more severely."" Tommy was glad the lecture was over, and more glad to get his turtle-soup; he finished one plate, and, as he asked for another, he said, ""Tommy won't put thimble in again; put tin pot in next time."" After dinner they went to their work again, and did not come in again till sunset. ""The clouds are gathering fast, sir,"" observed Ready; ""we shall have rain to-night."" ""I fear we shall; but we must expect it now, Ready."" ""Yes, sir; and by and by we shall have it for days together."" ""Ready,"" said Mrs Seagrave, ""if you are not too tired, perhaps you will go on with your history."" ""Certainly, ma'am, if you wish it,"" replied Ready.  ""When I left off, I was on board of the collier, bound to London.  We had a very fair wind, and a quick passage.  I was very sick until we arrived in the Nore, and then I recovered, and, as you may suppose, was astonished at the busy scene, and the quantity of vessels which were going up and down the river.  But I did not like my captain; he was very severe and brutal to the men; and the apprentice who was on board told me to run away, and get into another vessel, and not to bind myself apprentice to this captain, or I should be beat all day long, and be treated as bad as he was.  I knew this was the case, as the captain kicked and cuffed him twenty times a day.  The men said that he did not do so to me, for fear I should refuse to be his apprentice; but that, as soon as my indentures were signed, he would treat me in the same way. ""Well, I made up my mind that I would not remain in the collier; and, as the captain had gone on shore, I had plenty of time to look about me. There was a large ship, which was ready to sail, lying in the stream; I spoke to two boys who were at the stairs in her boat, and they told me that they were very comfortable on board, and that the captain wanted two or three apprentices.  I went on board with them, and offered myself.  The captain asked me a great many questions, and I told him the truth, and why I did not like to remain in the collier.  He agreed to take me; and I went on shore with him, signed my indentures, and received from him a sufficient supply of clothes; and, two days afterwards, we sailed for Bombay and China.""
