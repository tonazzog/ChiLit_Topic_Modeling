"CHAPTER I. GREAT PLANS.  It was a gloomy Sunday in the gloomiest part of the year, when the fog hung over London day and night, only lifting itself off a little for two or three hours about noon time. The bells which rang from the church towers might have been chiming from some region above the clouds, so distant they sounded and so hidden were the belfries in which they hung. In the early part of the day the congregations went to and from their various places of worship with a feeling of sombre depression at the long continuance of the gloom; but after nightfall the darkness was only natural, and though the lamps gave but little light, and shone merely like yellow balls in the fog, the passengers in the street moved more briskly and talked more cheerfully than in the morning. Here and there the brilliantly illuminated windows of some church or chapel cast a pleasant gleam upon the pavement, and the open doors seemed to invite any cold or weary passer-by to enter into its light and warmth; but as if these buildings, the temples of God, were designed only for the rich, and for those who had comfort enough in their own dwellings, it was noticeable that but a very scanty sprinkling of worshippers dressed in vile raiment were to be seen among the congregations, though there was no lack of those who wore goodly apparel and gay clothing. The fashionable chapel of which Daniel Standring was the chapel-keeper was no exception to the general rule, for there were no poor to be found in it. There was within it every appliance of comfort and style such as could give satisfaction to a wealthy congregation. The oak pews were high enough for the head of an occasional slumberer to repose in quiet indulgence, and they were well lined and carpeted and cushioned. The shades for the lamps toned down their light to a clear yet soft lustre, and the apparatus for heating the building was of the most efficient kind. The crowds who flocked to hear the minister were increasing every Sunday, and Daniel Standring had, with some reluctance, yielded to the necessity of sharing his office of pew-opener with a colleague; a man, however, of less dignity and solemnity of deportment than himself, and who was quite willing to look up to him as a superior. Moreover, the old members of the church, the “carriage people” especially, recognized him only as their chapel-keeper, and entrusted any message or any commission to him alone; and he also retained the charge of attending upon the vestry. The other man was no more than a subordinate; and after a while he was reconciled to this division of the office. There had been two things much talked about among the people for some time past: the first, that the minister himself should have a colleague found for him, and the second, that a large and still more fashionable chapel should be built. As to the colleague there were several difficulties in the way, the chief one being to find such a preacher as would attract the same congregations as those which came in crowds to listen to the minister; for it was found that whenever it was known that he would be absent from his pulpit the numbers dwindled away, until during his yearly holiday the chapel would seem almost empty, compared to the throng of curious and eager listeners who hung upon his words, and scarcely dared to sigh over his representations of their misery and peril lest they should miss hearing a single syllable of the eloquence which described it. Still every member of the congregation said it was essential that a colleague should be found for their beloved pastor before he had quite worn himself out; and great blame was thrown back upon the small provincial church which five-and-twenty years ago had thrust him, a mere youth of twenty, upon the exhausting duties of the ministry. As for the second subject, it was settled without much difficulty, for only money, not a man, was wanted; and upon the vestry table there was a subscription-list already promising some thousands of pounds, and beside it lay the plans for the new chapel, drawn up by an eminent architect. The chapel doors had been opened by Daniel, and the gas toned down to precisely the brilliance and softness which the congregation loved, especially the lamps on each side of the pulpit, which shed a revealing light upon the minister’s thoughtful face and upon his dark hair just tinged with grey. In the vestry Jessica had just given a final and delicate stroke of dusting, and was wiping the large pulpit Bible and hymn-book with her clean pocket-handkerchief ready for Daniel to carry up into the pulpit while the organist was playing the opening voluntary, which he did with so solemn and ministerial an aspect that a stranger, not accustomed to the etiquette of the place, might be betrayed into the supposition that he was the minister himself. Daniel was waiting now in the porch like some faithful steward ready to receive his master’s guests; and as carriage after carriage rolled up almost a smile of satisfaction softened his rigid features. The minister’s children had passed him with a smile and a nod, and he had shut the door of their pew in the corner, so he knew the minister was come, and putting a little additional briskness in his manner he looked out for seats for the strangers who were filling the aisles, at the same time listening for the first notes of the organ. The minister had entered the vestry just as Jessica had finished wiping the imaginary dust off the Bible and hymn-book, and he drew his chair up close to the fire, as if coming through the fog had chilled him. He looked sad and downcast, and his head sank forward upon his breast. For a minute Jessica stood behind his chair in silence, and then she stretched out her hand, a small thin hand still, and laid it timidly upon his arm. “Jessica,” said the minister, covering her small palm with his scholarly hand, “I am sorrowful to-night, and I have great heaviness of heart. Tell me, my child, do you understand what I preach about in my pulpit?” ",great plans gloomy gloomiest part year fog hang day night lift hour noon time bell ring church tower chime region cloud distant sound hide belfry hang early part day congregation various place worship feeling sombre depression long continuance gloom nightfall darkness natural lamp give light shine yellow ball fog passenger street move talk morning illuminate window church chapel cast pleasant gleam pavement open door seem invite cold weary passer enter light warmth building temple design rich comfort own dwelling noticeable scanty sprinkling worshipper dress vile raiment congregation lack wear goodly apparel gay clothing fashionable chapel chapel keeper exception general rule poor find appliance comfort style such give satisfaction wealthy congregation oak pew high head occasional slumberer repose quiet indulgence line carpet cushion shade lamp tone light clear soft lustre apparatus heating building efficient kind crowd flock hear minister increase reluctance yield necessity share office pew opener colleague man less dignity solemnity deportment willing superior old member church carriage person recognize chapel keeper entrust message commission retain charge attend vestry other man more subordinate while reconcile division office thing talk person time past first minister colleague find second large fashionable chapel build colleague several difficulty way chief one find preacher attract same congregation crowd listen minister find absent pulpit number dwindle yearly holiday chapel seem empty compare throng curious eager listener hang word dare sigh representation misery peril miss hear single syllable eloquence describe member congregation essential colleague find beloved pastor wear great blame throw small provincial church year thrust mere youth exhausting duty ministry second subject settle much difficulty money man want vestry table subscription list promise thousand pound lay plan new chapel draw eminent architect chapel door open gas tone brilliance softness congregation love lamp side pulpit shed reveal light minister thoughtful face dark hair ting grey vestry give final delicate stroke dusting wipe large pulpit hymn book clean pocket handkerchief ready carry pulpit organist play open voluntary solemn ministerial aspect stranger accustom etiquette place betray supposition minister wait porch faithful steward ready receive master guest carriage carriage roll smile satisfaction soften rigid feature minister child pass smile nod shut door pew corner minister put additional briskness manner seat stranger fill aisle same time listen first note organ minister enter vestry finish wipe imaginary dust hymn book draw chair fire fog chill sad downcast head sink breast minute stand chair silence stretch hand small thin hand lay arm minister cover small palm scholarly hand sorrowful night great heaviness heart child understand preach pulpit
