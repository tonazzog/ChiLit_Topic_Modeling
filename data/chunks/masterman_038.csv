"The construction of the fish-pond proceeded rapidly, and on the third day it was nearly complete.  As soon as all the walls were finished, Ready threw out sand and shingle, so as to make the part next to the beach nearly as deep as the other; so that there might be sufficient water to prevent the gulls and man-of-war birds from darting down, and striking the fish.  While Ready was thus employed, Mr Seagrave and William collected more rocks, so as to divide the pond into four parts, at the same time allowing a communication between each part.  These inside walls, as well as the outside, were made of sufficient width to walk upon; by which means they would have all the fish within reach of the spear, in case they wished to take them out.  The day after the pond was completed the weather changed.  The rain poured down with great force, but it was not accompanied with such terrific thunder and lightning, nor were the storms of so long continuance, as at the commencement of the rainy season.  In the intervals of fine weather they caught a great many fish, which they put into the pond, so that it was well stocked.  But a circumstance occurred, which was the occasion of great alarm to them all; which was, that one evening William was taken with a shivering, and complained very much of a pain in his head.  Ready had promised to continue his narrative on that evening, but William was too ill to sit up.  He was put into bed, and the next morning he was in a violent fever.  Mr Seagrave was much alarmed, as the symptoms were worse every hour; and Ready, who had sat up with him during the night, called Mr Seagrave out of the house, and said, ""This is a bad case, sir: William was working yesterday with his hat off, and I fear that he has been struck by the sun."" The poor boy was for many days in great danger; and the cheerful house was now one of gloom and silence.  How fervent were now the morning and evening prayers; how often during the day did his parents offer up a petition to heaven for their dear boy's recovery.  The weather became finer every day, and it was almost impossible to keep Tommy quiet: Juno went out with him and Albert every morning, and kept them with her while she cooked; and, fortunately, Vixen had some young ones, and when Juno could no longer amuse them, she brought them two of the puppies to play with.  As for the quiet, meek little Caroline, she would remain during the whole day holding her mother's hand, and watching her brother, or working with her needle by the side of his bed. Ready, who could not be idle, had taken the hammer and cold chisel to make the salt-pan, at which he worked during those portions of the day in which his services were not required indoors; and as he sat chipping away the rock, his thoughts were ever upon William, for he dearly loved the boy for his amiable disposition and his cleverness; and many a time during the day would he stop his work, and the tears would run down his cheeks as he offered up his petition to the Almighty that the boy might be spared to his afflicted parents.  And those prayers were heard, for on the ninth day William was pronounced by Ready and Mr Seagrave to have much less fever, and shortly afterwards it left him altogether; but he was so weak that he could not raise himself in his bed for two or three days; and it was not till more than a fortnight after the fever had left him that he could go out of the house.  The joy that was expressed by them all when the change took place may be imagined: nor were the thanksgivings less fervent than had been the prayers. During his convalescence, as there was nothing else to do, Mr Seagrave and Ready, who now went gladly to their work, determined, as the salt-pan was finished, that they would make a bathing-place.  Juno came to their assistance, and was very useful in assisting to drag the wheels which brought the rocks and stones; and Tommy was also brought down, that he might be out of the way while Mrs Seagrave and Caroline watched the invalid.  By the time that William was able to go out of the house, the bathing-place was finished, and there was no longer any fear of the sharks.  William came down to the beach with his mother, and looked at the work which had been done; he was much pleased with it, and said, ""Now, Ready, we have finished everything at home for the present; all we have to do is to explore the island, and to go to the cove and examine our collection from the wreck."" ""Very true, William; and the weather has been so fine, that I think we may venture upon one or the other in a few days more; but not till you are stronger."" ""I shall soon be strong again, Ready."" ""I have no doubt of it, William; and we have good reason to thank God, for we could ill spare you."" ""It's a long while since you have gone on with your story, Ready,"" said William, after they had taken their supper; ""I wish you would do so now, as I am sure I shall not be tired."" ""With pleasure, William,"" replied Ready; ""but can you remember where I left off, for my memory is none of the best?"" ""Oh, yes; if you recollect, you had just arrived at a Dutch farmer's house, in company with the savages, at a place called Graaff Reinet, I think."" ""Well then, the Dutch farmer came out when he saw us coming, and asked us who we were.  We told him that we were English prisoners, and that we wished to give ourselves up to the authorities.  He took away our arms and ammunition, and said that he was the authority in that part, which was true enough; and then he said, `You'll not run away without arms and ammunition, that's certain.  As for sending you to the Cape, that I may not be able to do for months; so if you wish to be fed well, you must work well while you're here.'  We replied, that we should be very glad to make ourselves useful, and then he sent us some dinner by a Hottentot girl.  But we soon found out that we had to deal with an ill-tempered, brutal fellow; and that he gave us plenty of hard work, but by no means plenty of food.  He would not trust us with guns, so the Hottentots went out with the cattle, but he gave us plenty of work to do about the house; and at last he treated us very cruelly.  When he was short of provisions for the Hottentots and other slaves, of whom he had a good many, he would go out with the other farmers who lived near him, and shoot quaggas for them to eat.  Nobody but a Hottentot could live upon such flesh."" ""What is quagga?"" ""A wild ass, partly covered with stripes, but not so much as the zebra; a pretty animal to look at, but the flesh is very bad.  At last he would give us nothing to eat but quaggas, the same as the Hottentots, while he and his family--for he had a wife and five children--lived upon mutton and the flesh of the antelope, which is very excellent eating.  We asked him to allow us a gun to procure better food, and he kicked Romer so unmercifully, that he could not work for two days afterwards.  Our lives became quite a burden to us; we were employed all day on the farm, and every day he was more brutal towards us.  At last we agreed that we would stand it no longer, and one evening Hastings told him so.  This put him into a great rage, and he called two of the slaves, and ordered them to tie him to the waggon wheel, swearing that he would cut every bit of skin off his body, and he went into his house to get his whip. The slaves had hold of Hastings, and were tying him up, for they dared not disobey their master, when he said to us, `If I am flogged this way, it will be all over with us.  Now's your time; run back behind the house, and when he comes out with the whip, do you go in and seize the muskets, which are always ready loaded.  Hold him at bay till I get clear, and then we will get away somehow or other.  You must do it, for I am sure he will flog me till I am dead, and he will shoot you, as runaway prisoners, as he did his two Hottentots the other day.'  As Romer and I thought this very probable, we did as Hastings told us; and when the Dutchman had gone towards him where he was tied up, about fifty yards from the house, we went in.  The farmer's wife was in bed, having just had an addition to her family, and the children we cared not for. We seized two muskets and a large knife, and came out just as the Dutchman had struck the first blow with the rhinoceros whip, which was so severe, that it took away poor Hastings' breath.  We went up; he turned round and saw us: we levelled our muskets at him, and he stopped. `Another blow, and we'll shoot you,' cried Romer.  `Yes,' cried I; `we are only boys, but you've Englishmen to deal with.'  When we came up, Romer kept his piece levelled at the Dutchman, while I passed him, and with the knife cut the thongs which bound Hastings.  The Dutchman turned pale and did not speak, he was so frightened, and the slaves ran away. As soon as Hastings was free, he seized a large wooden mallet, used for driving in stakes, and struck the Dutchman down to the earth, crying out, `That for flogging an Englishman, you rascal!'
