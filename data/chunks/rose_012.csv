"CHAPTER XI. WHAT GRUFFANUFF DID TO GIGLIO AND BETSINDA Gruffanuff, who had seen what had happened with the King, and knew that Giglio must come to grief, got up very early the next morning, and went to devise some plans for rescuing her darling husband, as the silly old thing insisted on calling him. She found him walking up and down the garden, thinking of a rhyme for Betsinda (TINDER and WINDA were all he could find), and indeed having forgotten all about the past evening, except that Betsinda was the most lovely of beings. ‘Well, dear Giglio,’ says Gruff. ‘Well, dear Gruffy,’ says Giglio, only HE was quite satirical. ‘I have been thinking, darling, what you must do in this scrape. You must fly the country for a while.’ ‘What scrape?--fly the country? Never without her I love, Countess,’ says Giglio. ‘No, she will accompany you, dear Prince,’ she says, in her most coaxing accents. ‘First, we must get the jewels belonging to our royal parents. and those of her and his present Majesty. Here is the key, duck; they are all yours, you know, by right, for you are the rightful King of Paflagonia, and your wife will be the rightful Queen.’ ‘Will she?’ says Giglio. ‘Yes; and having got the jewels, go to Glumboso’s apartment, where, under his bed, you will find sacks containing money to the amount of L2I7,000,000,987,439, 13S. 6 1/2d., all belonging to you, for he took it out of your royal father’s room on the day of his death. With this we will fly.’ ‘WE will fly?’ says Giglio. ‘Yes, you and your bride--your affianced love--your Gruffy!’ says the Countess, with a languishing leer. ‘YOU my bride!’ says Giglio. ‘You, you hideous old woman!’ ‘Oh, you--you wretch! didn’t you give me this paper promising marriage?’ cries Gruff. ‘Get away, you old goose! I love Betsinda, and Betsinda only!’ And in a fit of terror he ran from her as quickly as he could. ‘He! he! he!’ shrieks out Gruff; ‘a promise is a promise if there are laws in Paflagonia! And as for that monster, that wretch, that fiend, that ugly little vixen--as for that upstart, that ingrate, that beast, Betsinda, Master Giglio will have no little difficulty in discovering her whereabouts. He may look very long before finding HER, I warrant. He little knows that Miss Betsinda is--’ Is--what? Now, you shall hear. Poor Betsinda got up at five in winter’s morning to bring her cruel mistress her tea; and instead of finding her in a good humour, found Gruffy as cross as two sticks. The Countess boxed Betsinda’s ears half a dozen times whilst she was dressing; but as poor little Betsinda was used to this kind of treatment, she did not feel any special alarm. ‘And now,’ says she, ‘when Her Majesty rings her bell twice, I’ll trouble you, miss, to attend.’ So when the Queen’s bell rang twice, Betsinda came to Her Majesty and made a pretty little curtsey. The Queen, the Princess, and Gruffanuff were all three in the room. As soon as they saw her they began, ‘You wretch!’ says the Queen. ‘You little vulgar thing!’ says the Princess. ‘You beast!’ says Gruffanuff. ‘Get out of my sight!’ says the Queen. ‘Go away with you, do!’ says the Princess. ‘Quit the premises!’ says Gruffanuff. ‘Alas! and woe is me!’ very lamentable events had occurred to Betsinda that morning, and all in consequence of that fatal warming-pan business of the previous night. The King had offered to marry her; of course Her Majesty the Queen was jealous: Bulbo had fallen in love with her; of course Angelica was furious: Giglio was in love with her, and oh, what a fury Gruffy was in!      ‘Take off that {cap   } I gave you,’      {petticoat} they said, all      {gown   } at once,      and began tearing the clothes off poor Betsinda.      ‘How    (the King?’   } cried the Queen,      dare you  {Prince Bulbo?’ } the Princess, and      flirt with {Prince Giglio?’ } Countess. ‘Give her the rags she wore when she came into the house, and turn her out of it!’ cries the Queen. ‘Mind she does not go with MY shoes on, which I lent her so kindly,’ says the Princess; and indeed the Princess’s shoes were a great deal too big for Betsinda. ‘Come with me, you filthy hussy!’ and taking up the Queen’s poker, the cruel Gruffanuff drove Betsinda into her room. The Countess went to the glass box in which she had kept Betsinda’s old cloak and shoe this ever so long, and said, ‘Take those rags, you little beggar creature, and strip off everything belonging to honest people, and go about your business’; and she actually tore off the poor little delicate thing’s back almost all her things, and told her to be off out of the house. Poor Betsinda huddled the cloak round her back, on which were embroidered the letters PRIN. . . ROSAL. . . and then came a great rent. As for the shoe, what was she to do with one poor little tootsey sandal? the string was still to it, so she hung it round her neck. ‘Won’t you give me a pair of shoes to go out in the snow, mum, if you please, mum?’ cried the poor child. ‘No, you wicked beast!’ says Gruffanuff, driving her along with the poker--driving her down the cold stairs--driving her through the cold hall--flinging her out into the cold street, so that the knocker itself shed tears to see her! But a kind fairy made the soft snow warm for her little feet, and she wrapped herself up in the ermine of her mantle, and was gone!  ‘And now let us think about breakfast,’ says the greedy Queen. ‘What dress shall I put on, mamma? the pink or the peagreen?’ says Angelica. ‘Which do you think the dear Prince will like best?’ ‘Mrs. V.!’ sings out the King from his dressing-room, ‘let us have sausages for breakfast! Remember we have Prince Bulbo staying with us!’ And they all went to get ready. Nine o’clock came, and they were all in the breakfast-room, and no Prince Bulbo as yet. The urn was hissing and humming: the muffins were smoking--such a heap of muffins! the eggs were done, there was a pot of raspberry jam, and coffee, and a beautiful chicken and tongue on the side-table. Marmitonio the cook brought in the sausages. Oh, how nice they smelt! ‘Where is Bulbo?’ said the King. ‘John, where is His Royal Highness?’ John said he had a took hup His Roilighnessesses shaving-water, and his clothes and things, and he wasn’t in his room, which he sposed His Royliness was just stepped trout. ‘Stepped out before breakfast in the snow! Impossible!’ says the King, sticking his fork into a sausage. ‘My dear, take one. Angelica, won’t you have a saveloy?’ The Princess took one, being very fond of them; and at this moment Glumboso entered with Captain Hedzoff, both looking very much disturbed. ‘I am afraid Your Majesty--’ cries Glumboso. ‘No business before breakfast, Glum!’ says the King.’ Breakfast first, business next. Mrs. V., some more sugar!’ ‘Sire, I am afraid if we wait till after breakfast it will be too late,’ says Glumboso. ‘He--he--he’ll be hanged at half-past nine.’ ‘Don’t talk about hanging and spoil my breakfast, you unkind, vulgar man you,’ cries the Princess. ‘John, some mustard. Pray who is to be hanged?’ ‘Sire, it is the Prince,’ whispers Glumboso to the King. ‘Talk about business after breakfast, I tell you!’ says His Majesty, quite sulky. ‘We shall have a war, Sire, depend on it,’ says the Minister. ‘His father, King Padella. . .’ ‘His father, King WHO?’ says the King. ‘King Padella is not Giglio’s father. My brother, King Savio, was Giglio’s father.’ ‘It’s Prince Bulbo they are hanging, Sire, not Prince Giglio,’ says the Prime Minister. ‘You told me to hang the Prince, and I took the ugly one,’ says Hedzoff. ‘I didn’t, of course, think Your Majesty intended to murder your own flesh and blood!’ The King for all reply flung the plate of sausages at Hedzoff’s head. The Princess cried out ‘Hee-kareekaree!’ and fell down in a fainting fit. ‘Turn the cock of the urn upon Her Royal Highness,’ said the King, and the boiling water gradually revived her. His Majesty looked at his watch, compared it by the clock in the parlour, and by that of the church in the square opposite; then he wound it up; then he looked at it again. ‘The great question is,’ says he, ‘am I fast or am I slow? If I’m slow, we may as well go on with breakfast. If I’m fast, why, there is just the possibility of saving Prince Bulbo. It’s a doosid awkward mistake, and upon my word, Hedzoff, I have the greatest mind to have you hanged too.’ ", happen grief next morning devise plan rescuing darling husband silly old thing insist call find walk garden rhyme find forget past evening lovely being dear dear satirical darling scrape fly country while scrape fly country love accompany dear coax accent jewel belong royal parent present key duck right rightful wife rightful  jewel apartment bed find sack contain money amount die belong royal father room day death fly fly bride affianced love languish leer bride hideous old woman wretch give paper promise marriage cry old goose love fit terror run shriek promise promise law monster wretch fiend ugly vixen upstart beast difficulty discover whereabouts find warrant hear poor winter morning bring cruel mistress tea find humour find cross stick box ear time dress poor use kind treatment feel special alarm ring bell trouble miss attend bell ring curtsey room begin wretch vulgar thing beast sight  quit premise woe lamentable event occur morning consequence fatal warming pan business previous night offer marry course jealous fall love course furious love fury give petticoat gown begin tear clothes poor cry flirt countess give rag wear house turn cry mind shoe loan shoe great deal big filthy hussy poker cruel drive room glass box keep old cloak shoe rag beggar creature strip belong honest person business tore poor delicate thing thing house poor huddle cloak back embroider letter prin great rent shoe poor tootsey sandal string hang neck give pair shoe snow mum mum cry poor child wicked beast drive poker drive cold stair drive cold hall fling cold street knocker shed tear kind fairy soft snow warm foot wrap ermine mantle gone let breakfast greedy dress put mamma pink peagreen dear like sing dress room let sausages breakfast remember stay ready breakfast room urn hiss hum muffin smoke heap muffin egg pot raspberry jam coffee beautiful chicken tongue side table cook bring sausages nice smell royal hup shaving water clothes thing room spose step trout stepp breakfast snow impossible stick fork sausage dear saveloy fond moment enter disturb afraid cry business breakfast breakfast business more sugar sire afraid wait breakfast late hang half past talk hang spoil breakfast unkind vulgar man cry mustard pray hang whisper talk business breakfast sulky war depend minister father father father brother father hang prime hang ugly one course intend murder own flesh blood reply flung plate sausages head cry fall fainting fit turn cock urn royal boil water revive watch compare clock parlour church square opposite wind great question fast slow slow breakfast fast possibility save doosid awkward mistake word great mind hang
