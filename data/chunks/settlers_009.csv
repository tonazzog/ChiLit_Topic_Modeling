"CHAPTER 9. ONE PRISONER RELEASED. In the morning, it appeared that it had been right to remove to the Red-hill the night before.  Only some fragments of the roof of the house remained.  Some beams and a quantity of rubbish had fallen into the room where the party had lived since the flood came; and a heap of this rubbish lay on the very spot where Mildred would have been sleeping if they had stayed.  All saw and considered this with awe.  Roger himself looked first at the little girl, and then at that part of the ruin, as if imagining what it would have been for her to be lying there, and wondering to see her standing here, alive and unhurt. ""Look how that wall stands out;"" said Oliver.  ""The faster the house falls, the more haste we must make to save what we can."" ""Oh!  Cannot you stay quietly to-day?"" asked Mildred.  ""I think we have got all we really want; and this bustle and hurry and hard work every day are so tiresome!  Cannot we keep still and rest to-day?"" ""To-morrow, dear,"" replied her brother.  ""To-morrow is Sunday!  And we will try to rest.  But there is no knowing how long we may have to live in this place, in the middle of the waters; and it is my duty to save everything I can that can make George and you and the rest of us comfortable when the colder weather comes on."" ""I wonder what all the world is about, that nobody comes to see after us,"" said Mildred, sighing. ""Out of sight, out of mind, Mildred,"" said Ailwin.  ""That is the way, all the world over."" ""I am sure it is not,"" said Oliver.  ""Mildred and I say as little as we can about father and mother, but don't you imagine such a thing as that they are out of our minds.  I know Mildred never shuts her eyes, but she sees the mill floating away, as it did that evening, and father standing..."" He could not go on about that.  Presently he said, ""When the flood came, I suppose, there were no boats to be had.  It would take the first day to bring them from a distance, and get them afloat.  Then the people would look round (as they ought to do) to see where they could do most good.  Nobody who looked through a glass this way, since the day before yesterday, and saw those rafters sticking up in the air,--the house in ruins as it is,--would suppose that any one could be left alive here. From a distance, they can hardly fancy that even any little mouse could help being either drowned or starved.  This will be about the last spot in the Levels that any boat will come to.--You see, Mildred, our Red-hill, though it is everything to us, is but a speck compared with the grounds that have stood above water since the waters began to sink. We had better not think of anything but living on as we can, unless it should please God that we should die."" Roger did not want to hear anything more of this kind; so he went to where George was lying, and began to whistle softly to him.  The child was so altered that his own mother would hardly have known him: but he smiled when he heard the whistle; and the smile was his own.  He put up his hand and patted Roger's face, and even pulled his hair with a good stout pull.  Roger had been used to nurse his dog, though not little children.  He now took George into his arms, and laid him comfortably across his knees, while he whistled till the little fellow looked full in his face, and puckered up his poor white lips, as if he would whistle too.  This made Roger laugh aloud; and then George laughed.  Ailwin heard them, and peeped into the corner of the tent where they were.  She flew to Oliver, to tell him that Roger was at his tricks worse than ever,--he was bewitching the baby.  She was angry at Oliver for telling his sister, when he had looked in too, that they might have been very glad any of them, to bewitch poor baby in this manner, when he was crying so sadly all yesterday.  Mildred, for her part, ran to thank Roger, and say how glad she should be to be able to whistle as he could. ""How should you?"" said Roger,--""you who never had a dog, or caught any sort of a bird in your life, I dare say."" ""No, I never could.  One day, long ago, when mother was very busy, and I was tired of playing, she gave me some salt into my hand, and told me I might put it upon the birds' tails in the garden, and so catch them: but I did not get one.  At last, half the salt was spilt, and the other half was melted in my hand; and then dinner was ready.  I suppose that was a joke of mother's."" ""She wanted you out of the way; and what a fool you must have been not to find that out!  Why, the birds could not have been sillier, if they had let you put the salt upon their tails."" ""It was a long while ago,"" pleaded Mildred.  ""Here, take him,"" said Roger, popping George into her arms.  ""Show him how to catch birds if you like.  I can't spend my time any longer here."" ""How he cries after you!"" exclaimed Mildred.  It was the first time Roger had ever known anybody to be sorry for his going away.  The child was certainly crying after him.  He half turned back, but turned again, saying-- ""Can't you tell him I will come again by-and-by?  I must be off now."" The truth was, Roger had never forgotten the chest--the oaken chest which looked so tempting when he saw it floating down, and Oliver would not stop to catch it,--the stout chest which he knew to be now safe and sound somewhere about the house, unless harm had happened to it during the night.  Oliver agreed that it was of importance to bring this chest on shore: and the boys lost no time in doing it.  Mildred came out with George to watch their proceedings, and found that Oliver had already made one trip, and brought over some articles of use and value.  He came up to his sister, with something which he held carefully covered up in both hands.  He said gravely-- ""Here, dear, put this in some safe place,--where no one will know of it but you and me."" ""A watch!--mother's watch!"" ""I found it, with several things in her cupboard, thrown down by the wall breaking."" ""It does not seem to be hurt,"" observed Mildred.  ""And how often you have wished for a watch!"" ""I think I shall never wish for anything again,"" said Oliver.  Mildred saw his face as he turned away, and began to consider where she could put the watch, so that it might be safe, and that Roger might not see it, nor Oliver be reminded of it. Ailwin and Roger were meantime disputing about which should have the raft first,--Roger wanting to secure the chest, and Ailwin insisting that it was high time the cow was milked.  Oliver said he was master here in his father's absence, and he would have no quarrels.  All three should go on the raft.  Roger should be landed at the staircase, where he could be collecting what he wanted to bring over, while Oliver proceeded to set Ailwin ashore beside the cow.  By working to the number of three, in harmony, far more would be gained than by using up strength in fighting and disputing.  He did not care how many times he crossed the water this day, if those whom he rowed would but keep the peace.  He would willingly be their servant in rowing, though he chose to be their master in deciding. Ailwin stared at Oliver.  It had struck her, and Mildred too, that Oliver seemed to have grown many years older since the flood came.  He was no taller, and no stronger;--indeed he seemed to-day to be growing weaker with fatigue; but he was not the timid boy he had always appeared before.  He spoke like a man; and there was the spirit of a man in his eyes.  It was not a singular instance.  There have been other cases in which a timid boy has been made a man of, on a sudden, by having to protect, from danger or in sorrow, some weaker than himself.  Roger felt something of the truth; and this had as much to do with making him quiet and tractable to-day as his interest about George, or his liking to live in a tent with companions, rather than in the open air and alone.

"Ailwin was but a short time gone.  She came up the bank to Mildred, swinging her empty milk-pail, and sobbing, as if from the bottom of her heart.  Mildred did not think she had ever seen Ailwin cry so before; and she could imagine nothing now but that Oliver was lost.  She turned so giddy in a moment that she could not see Ailwin, and so sick that she could not speak to her. ""So you have heard, Mildred,--you have heard, I see by your being so white.  Oliver says she has been dead ever so many hours.  I say, if we had gone the first thing, instead of staring and poking about yon tumble-down house, we might have saved her.  I shall never milk her again,--not a drop!--nor any other either, so far as I see; for there is no saying that we shall ever get away.  Here I have not a drop of milk to give you, my dear, though you are as white as the wall."" ""Never mind,"" gasped Mildred, ""if it is only the cow.  I thought it had been Oliver."" ""Oliver!  Bless your heart!  There he is as busy about the house and things, as if nothing had happened; and just as provoking as you for caring nothing about the poor cow.  There she lies, poor soul!  Dead and cold, half in the water, and half out.  She was worth you two put together, for some things,--I can tell you that."" ""Indeed I am very sorry,"" said Mildred; and as she saw George pulling about the empty can, she melted into tears, which would come faster and faster till Oliver again stood by her side.  She tried to tell him what she had been afraid of, and how she thought she should not have cried but for that;--or, at least, not so much; but she really could not explain what she felt, her sobs came so thick. ""I do not know exactly what you mean, dear,"" said Oliver; ""but I understand that you must be crying about the cow.  I am very sorry,-- very.  I had rather have lost anything we have left than the cow, now George is so ill.""--Here he bit his lip, and looked away from George, lest he should cry like his sister.  He went on, however, talking rather quickly at first, but becoming more composed as he proceeded.  He said, ""I have been thinking that it will never do for us who may be near losing everything we have, and our lives, after all, to grieve over each separate loss as it happens.  When you said your prayers the first night of the flood..."" ""How long ago that does seem!"" exclaimed Mildred. ""It does, indeed!"" replied Oliver, glad to hear her say something distinctly.  ""When we said our prayers that night, and whenever we have said them since, we begged that we might be able to bear dying in this flood,--to bear whatever it pleased God to do.  Now, our right way is to make up our minds at once to everything, and just in the way it pleases God.  Let us try to bear it cheerfully, whether we lose the cow or anything else first; or whether we all die together.  That is the way, Mildred!--And if you and I should not die together, that must be the way too."" ""I hope we shall though."" ""I think it is very likely; and that before long.  And then how useless it will have been to be unhappy about anything we can lose here!  People who may be so near to death need not be anxious about this and that, like those who seem to have long to live.  So come, dear, and see this chest; and help us to settle what should be done with it."" There was nothing about the outside of the chest to show whose it might be.  Everybody agreed that it ought to be opened immediately, lest all that it contained should be spoiled by the wet.  But how to open it was the question; for it had a very stout lock, and strong hinges.  After many attempts, it was found that nothing short of proper tools would answer the purpose: and Oliver went to see if his could be reached. Through piles of rubbish, and a puddle of slimy water, he got to the spot where he had left them,--hidden behind straw, that the Redfurns might not discover and spoil them.  The straw was washed away, and his beautiful lump of alabaster reduced to slime; but his tools were there,--in no very bright condition, but safe.  He hastened away from the spot; for thoughts crowded upon his mind of the day when he had last used these tools, and the way of life in which he and Mildred had been so happy, and which seemed now to be over for ever.  He thought of the beautiful stone carvings over the doorway, and of what Pastor Dendel had said to him about them.  They had fallen; and who knew what had become of kind Pastor Dendel?  The garden, with all its fresh green and gay blossoms, was now a muddy stream; rank smells and thick mists now came up from what had been meadows and corn-fields; and his father, whose manly voice had been daily heard singing from the mill, where was he? It would not do to stay thinking of these things; so Oliver hastened back with his tools, and with the heavy kitchen hammer, which he also found. None of these would open the chest.  The party managed it at last by heating a large nail, which they drew out from a shattered door-post, and burning holes in the wood of the chest, close by the nails which fastened the hinges, so as to loosen them, and make them drop out.  The lid being raised, a great variety of articles was found within, so nicely packed that the wet had penetrated but a very little way. Mildred had looked on thoughtfully; and she saw that Oliver paused when the contents lay open to view.  She looked in her brother's face, and said-- ""I wonder who this chest belonged to?"" ""I was just thinking so,"" observed Oliver. ""Never mind that,"" said Ailwin.  ""We may know, some day or other, or we may not.  Meantime, it is ours.  Come, make haste, and see what there is to wrap up poor baby in, on cold nights."" ""We will look for something of that sort,--I am sure we might use such a thing as that,"" said Oliver: ""but..."" ""But,"" said Mildred, ""I don't think these other things are ours, any more than they ever were.  Nobody ever gave them to us.  They have belonged to somebody else;--to somebody that may be wondering at this moment where they are."" ""Nonsense, Mildred!"" exclaimed Ailwin.  ""Who gave you the harness that braces the raft, or the meal you have been living on these two days, I wonder: and how do you know but somebody is hungry, and longing for it, at this minute?"" ""I wish they had it, then,"" replied Mildred.  ""But, Oliver, were we wrong to use the meal?  I never thought of that."" ""Nor I: but I think we were right enough there.  The meal would all have been spoiled presently; and meal (and the harness too) is a sort of thing that we can pay for, or make up for in some way, if ever we can meet with the people who lost that chest."" ""And George, and all of us, might have starved without it."" ""Yes: we must take what we want to eat, when it comes in our way, and there is nobody to ask leave of: and, if ever we get out of this place, we can inquire who lost a meal-chest or set of harness, and offer to pay for what we took.  But I do think it is different with these things."" ""So do I,"" said Mildred.  ""Those table-cloths, and that embroidered cap,--somebody has taken pains to make them, and might not like to sell them.  And look!  Look at Roger!  He has pulled out a great heavy bag of money."" ""Now, Roger, put that bag where you found it,"" said Oliver.  ""It is none of yours."" ""How do I know that I shall find it again, the next time I look?"" replied Roger, walking off with the bag. Mildred was afraid of Oliver's following him, and of another quarrel happening.  She put her arm within her brother's, and he could easily guess why. ""Don't be afraid, dear,"" he said.  ""If Roger chooses to do a dishonest thing, it is his own affair.  We have warned him; and that is all we have to do with it.  We must be honest ourselves,--that is all."" ""Then I think we had better not look any further into the chest,"" said Mildred; ""only just to find something warm to wrap Geordie in.  The clothes look so nice--we might fancy we wanted things that we can very well do without.""

"""I am not much afraid of that,"" replied her brother: ""and it would be a pity the things should spoil with the damp.  They would be dry in an hour in this warm sun; and we could pack them away again before night."" ""Roger will never let you do that,"" declared Ailwin.  ""Not a rag will he leave to anybody that you don't stow away while he is out of sight. Never did I see such perverse children as you, and so thankless for God's gifts.  I should be ashamed to be no more grateful than you for what He puts into your very hands."" Mildred looked at her brother now with a different face.  She was perplexed and alarmed; but she saw that Oliver was not. ""Roger cannot carry off anything,"" he replied.  ""He may bury and hide what he pleases; but they will all be somewhere about the Red-hill; and we can tell anybody who comes to fetch us off whatever we know about the goods."" ""Nobody will ever come and fetch us off,"" said Ailwin, beginning to cry. ""The people at a distance don't care a straw what becomes of us; and you children here at hand are so perverse and troublesome, I don't know how to bear my life between you."" ""If nobody comes to save us,"" said Oliver, calmly, ""I do not see what good this money and these fine clothes will do to Roger and you."" ""Roger and me!  Pray what do you mean by that?"" ""I mean that you and he are for taking these things that do not belong to us; and Mildred and I are against it.  Only tell me this one thing, Ailwin.  Do you believe that your cloak and stockings were sent in Nan Redfurn's way, that she might take them?  And do you think it would have been perverse in her not to run away with them?"" ""Now, Oliver, what nonsense you talk!  As if I wanted a rag of these things for my own wear!  As if I would touch a penny that was not honestly got!"" ""So I always thought before; and so I shall think now, if you will help Mildred to dry whatever is damp, and then pack all away safely--all but such things as may do poor Geordie good."" Roger was not long in finding a hole in a tree where he could hide his bag of money.  He cut a small cross in the bark by which he might know the tree again, and hastened back, to see what else he could secure.  He found plenty of pretty things hanging on the bushes, and did not wait for their being quite dry to dress himself as he had never been dressed before.  With the embroidered cap above mentioned on his head, a scarlet waistcoat, worked with silver thread, hanging loose about his body, and a light blue coat, whose skirts reached his heels, he looked so little like the dirty ragged Roger, that Geordie shrank back from him, at first sight, and did not smile till he heard the soft whistle again.  After that, he seemed more pleased with the finery than all the rest of the party together.  Ailwin glanced scornfully upon it, as if she had disapproved from the beginning its being touched; and Oliver and Mildred looked grave. So very much pleased was Geordie with the gay waistcoat, that Roger took him into his arms, that he might be able to stroke it, and play with the silver flowers.  It was little fatigue, now, except to the spirits, to nurse poor George.  He was shrunk to skin and bone, and so light as to startle those who had been accustomed to lift him.  It was grievous, however, to look at the ghastly stretched features, the flabby tremulous little arms, and the suffering expression of countenance.  To hear his feeble cry was worse still.  Oliver was really glad to take Mildred away from seeing and hearing him, as long as the child would be quiet with Roger: so he asked her to filter more water through the gravel.  He begged her to get ready a great deal--enough for them all to drink, and to bathe George in; for the water about them was becoming of a worse quality every day.  It was unsafe even to live near; and much more to drink.  So he scraped up a quantity of clean dry gravel from the ledges of the precipice where the first flood had thrown it, and helped Mildred to press this gravel down in the worn old basket.  This basket they set across the tub, which they first thoroughly cleaned.  Mildred poured water upon the gravel by degrees; and it was astonishing how much purer and better it came out of the tub than it went into the basket.  When the tub was full, Ailwin heated some of the water presently over her large fire, and made a warm bath for the child. Roger was unwilling to give him up when the bath was ready, so new and so pleasant did he find it to be liked and loved by anybody--to have power over any one, so much more easy and delightful to exercise than that of force.  But, not only was the bath ready, and must not be left to cool, but Oliver beckoned him away on some very particular business. This business was indeed pressing.  All the party had complained that the bad smells about the Red-hill became really oppressive.  They did not know how great was the danger of their all falling ill of fever, in consequence; but every one of them felt languid and uncomfortable. Oliver made the circuit of the hill, to discover whether there was any cause for this evil that could be removed.  He was surprised to find the number of dead animals that were lying about in holes and corners, as well as the heap of Roger's game, now actually putrefying in the sun. There was also a dead horse thrown up, on the side where the quarry was; and about this horse were such swarms of flies as Oliver had never seen. It was to consult about pushing back this horse into the stream, and clearing away all other dead things that they could find, that Oliver now called Roger. Roger was struck with what he observed.  He saw no difficulty in clearing away the game he ought never to have left lying in a heap in the sun.  He believed, too, that with stout poles he and Oliver could shove the horse into the water; and, with a line tied to its head, tow it out of the still water into the current which yet ran from the quarry.  But what troubled him more was, that there was evidently a mortality among the animals on the hill.  They were dying in all directions; some for want of proper food, and from being put out of their usual habits: others from being preyed upon by their stronger neighbours.  Nothing seemed to thrive but the ravenous birds which came in clusters, winging their way over the waters, and making a great rustling of their pinions as they descended to perch upon some dead animal, pulling it to pieces before the very eyes of the boys, as they stood consulting what to do.  It was a horrid sight: and it brought the horrid thought that soon probably there would be no game left for food for the party; and that what there was meantime might be unwholesome. Oliver had never imagined that the bold boy, Roger Redfurn, could look so alarmed as he did at this moment.

"""Never mind, now, Roger,"" said he, ""what is likely to become of you and me.  Wait, and find that out by-and-by.  What I am afraid of is seeing Mildred look at all as George does now.  Come, let us set to work! Don't stand looking up in the sky, in that way.  Help me--do.  Cannot Spy help?  Call him; will you?"" ""We can't get away!"" exclaimed Roger, as if now, for the first time, awakened to his situation.  ""Those vile birds--they can go where they like--nasty creatures--and we cannot stir from where we are!"" ""I wish we had our singing birds back again, instead of these creatures,"" said Oliver.  ""Our shy, pretty, innocent little birds, that used to be so pleased to pick up twigs and straws to build their nests with, and be satisfied with the worms and slugs and flies that they cleared away from the garden.  I wish we had them, instead of these ugly, saucy, dirty birds.  But our birds are happier somewhere else, I dare say; in some dry, pleasant place among those hills, all sweet with flowers, and cool with clear running water."" ""They can get there, and we can't.  We can't get out of this hot steaming place: and those hills look further off every day.  I wish my uncle had been dead before he brought us down off the moors last time. I wish he had, I know.  If I was on the moor now, after the plovers..."" ""Come, come; forget all that now, and set to work,"" interrupted Oliver. ""If you won't call Spy to help, I will see whether he will mind me."" Spy came, with some hesitation, in answer to a whistle which was like his master's, but not exactly the same.  His master soon set him to work, and began to work himself, in a sort of desperation.  It was astonishing what a clearance was made in a short time.  But it did not do all the good that was expected.  There was so much vegetable decay in the region round, that the floating dead animals off to a distance caused only a partial relief. While the boys were hard at work at their disagreeable task, Mildred was enjoying seeing George in his warm bath.  Ailwin held him there, while Mildred continued her useful business of filtering water, talking to the child all the while.  The poor little fellow soon left off crying, and moved his weak limbs about in the tepid water, trying to splash Ailwin, as he had been wont to splash his mother in play, every morning when she washed and dressed him. ""I am sure it does him a great deal of good,"" exclaimed Mildred.  ""I will filter quantities of water; and he shall have a bath as often as ever it is good for him.  Suppose it should make him well!"" Ailwin shook her head.  She saw how impossible it would be even to keep a healthy child well in the absence of proper food, in an unwholesome atmosphere, and without sufficient shelter from the changes of weather which might come at any hour, and must come soon.  How unlikely it was that a sick baby should recover under such circumstances, she was well aware.  Yet she little thought how near the end was. After his bath, Geordie lay, nicely covered up, on a mattress under the tent.  One or other of his nurses visited, him every few minutes; and both were satisfied that he was comfortably asleep.  The boys came for some dinner, at last; and while Oliver went to wash his hands in clean water, Roger stooped over the child to kiss him.  Before doing so, however, he started back, and asked Ailwin why the baby's eyes looked so strangely.  They were half closed, and seemed like neither sleep nor waking.  Ailwin sat down on the mattress, and took him into her arms, while Mildred ran to call Oliver.  The poor child stretched himself stiff across Ailwin's knees, and then breathed no more. When Oliver and Mildred came running back, Ailwin was putting her cheek near the child's mouth, to feel if there was indeed no breath.  She shook her head, and her eyes ran over with tears.  Oliver kneeled down, and put his hand to the heart--it did not beat.  He lifted the wasted arm--it fell, as if it had never had life in it.  There lay the little body, still unmoved, with the face composed,--the eyes dim and half closed, the ear hearing nothing, the tongue silent, while all were calling on little George to say something he had been fond of saying, to hearken to something he had loved to hear, and--all in vain. ""Whistle to him, Roger!"" exclaimed Mildred, through her trembling.  ""Try if he cannot hear that.  Whistle to him softly."" Roger tried; but no notice was taken of the forced, irregular whistle which was the best he could give at the moment. ""Listen, dear!  Hark, George!  Only hear!"" exclaimed Mildred and Ailwin. ""O hush!  All of you!"" exclaimed Oliver.  ""Be quiet, Mildred dear!  Our little brother is dead."" Roger threw himself on the grass, and hid his face on his arms.  He moaned and rocked himself about, so that, even in the first moments of their grief, the brother and sister looked at each other with awe. ""Come away with me, dear,"" whispered Oliver to his sister.  ""Ailwin, give George to me.  Let me have him in my arms."" ""Bless you, my dears; it is not George any longer.  It is a poor little dead body.  You must not call it George."" ""Give him to me,"" said Oliver.  He took the body from Ailwin's arms, carrying it as gently as if anything could have hurt it now; and he and Mildred walked away towards the spot where the bee-shed had stood. Ailwin gazed after them, dashing away the tears with the back of her hand, when they gathered so that she could not see. Oliver and Mildred walked on till they could descend the bank a little, and sit, just above the waters, where they knew they were out of sight of everybody.  This bank presented a strange appearance, such as the children had been wondering at for some days, till Ailwin remembered that she had often heard say that there was once a thick forest growing where the Levels were now spread, and that the old trees were, every one, somehow underground.  It now appeared that this was true.  As the earth was washed away in the channel, and cut down along the bank, large trunks of trees were seen lying along, black as coal.  Some others started out of the bank; and the roots of a few spread like network, holding the soil together, and keeping the bank firm in that part.  Upon one of the trunks, that jutted out, Oliver took his seat; and Mildred placed herself beside him. ""Let him lie on my knee now,"" said she. ""Presently,"" said Oliver.  ""How easy and quiet he looks!"" ""And how quietly he died!"" observed Mildred.  ""I did not think it had been such an easy thing to die,--or half so easy for us to bear to see.""
