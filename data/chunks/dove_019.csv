"CHAPTER XVIII. FRIEDMUND IN THE CLOUDS  THE stone was quarried high on the mountain, and a direct road was made for bringing it down to the water-side.  The castle profited by the road in accessibility, but its impregnability was so far lessened.  However, as Ebbo said, it was to be a friendly harbour, instead of a robber crag, and in case of need the communication could easily be destroyed.  The blocks of stone were brought down, and wooden sheds were erected for the workmen in the meadow. In August, however, came tidings that, after two amputations of his diseased limb, the Kaisar Friedrich III. had died—it was said from over free use of melons in the fever consequent on the operation.  His death was not likely to make much change in the government, which had of late been left to his son.  At this time the King of the Romans (for the title of Kaisar was conferred only by coronation by the Pope, and this Maximilian never received) was at Innspruck collecting troops for the deliverance of Styria and Carinthia from a horde of invading Turks.  The Markgraf of Wurtemburg sent an intimation to all the Swabian League that the new sovereign would be best pleased if their homage were paid to him in his camp at the head of their armed retainers. Here was the way of enterprise and honour open at last, and the young barons of Adlerstein eagerly prepared for it, equipping their vassals and sending to Ulm to take three or four men-at-arms into their pay, so as to make up twenty lances as the contingent of Adlerstein.  It was decided that Christina should spend the time of their absence at Ulm, whither her sons would escort her on their way to the camp.  The last busy day was over, and in the summer evening Christina was sitting on the castle steps listening to Ebbo’s eager talk of his plans of interesting his hero, the King of the Romans, in his bridge, and obtaining full recognition of his claim to the Debateable Strand, where the busy workmen could be seen far below. Presently Ebbo, as usual when left to himself, grew restless for want of Friedel, and exclaiming, “The musing fit is on him!—he will stay all night at the tarn if I fetch him not,” he set off in quest of him, passing through the hamlet to look for him in the chapel on his way. Not finding Friedel there, he was, however, some way up towards the tarn, when he met his brother wearing the beamy yet awestruck look that he often brought from the mountain height, yet with a steadfast expression of resolute purpose on his face. “Ah, dreamer!” said Ebbo, “I knew where to seek thee!  Ever in the clouds!” “Yes, I have been to the tarn,” said Friedel, throwing his arm round his brother’s neck in their boyish fashion.  “It has been very dear to me, and I longed to see its gray depths once more.” “Once!  Yea manifold times shalt thou see them,” said Ebbo. “Schleiermacher tells me that these are no Janissaries, but a mere miscreant horde, even by whom glory can scarce be gained, and no peril at all.” “I know not,” said Friedel, “but it is to me as if I were taking my leave of all these purple hollows and heaven-lighted peaks cleaving the sky. All the more, Ebbo, since I have made up my mind to a resolution.” “Nay, none of the old monkish fancies,” cried Ebbo, “against them thou art sworn, so long as I am true knight.” “No, it is not the monkish fancy, but I am convinced that it is my duty to strive to ascertain my father’s fate.  Hold, I say not that it is thine.  Thou hast thy charge here—” “Looking for a dead man,” growled Ebbo; “a proper quest!” “Not so,” returned Friedel.  “At the camp it will surely be possible to learn, through either Schlangenwald or his men, how it went with my father.  Men say that his surviving son, the Teutonic knight, is of very different mould.  He might bring something to light.  Were it proved to be as the Schneiderlein avers, then would our conscience be at rest; but, if he were in Schlangenwald’s dungeon—” “Folly!  Impossible!” “Yet men have pined eighteen years in dark vaults,” said Friedel; “and, when I think that so may he have wasted for the whole of our lives that have been so free and joyous on his own mountain, it irks me to bound on the heather or gaze at the stars.” “If the serpent hath dared,” cried Ebbo, “though it is mere folly to think of it, we would summon the League and have his castle about his ears!  Not that I believe it.” “Scarce do I,” said Friedel; “but there haunts me evermore the description of the kindly German chained between the decks of the Corsair’s galley.  Once and again have I dreamt thereof.  And, Ebbo, recollect the prediction that so fretted thee.  Might not yon dark-cheeked woman have had some knowledge of the East and its captives?” Ebbo started, but resumed his former tone.  “So thou wouldst begin thine errantry like Sir Hildebert and Sir Hildebrand in the ‘Rose garden’? Have a care.  Such quests end in mortal conflict between the unknown father and son.” “I should know him,” said Friedel, enthusiastically, “or, at least, he would know my mother’s son in me; and, could I no otherwise ransom him, I would ply the oar in his stead.” “A fine exchange for my mother and me,” gloomily laughed Ebbo, “to lose thee, my sublimated self, for a rude, savage lord, who would straightway undo all our work, and rate and misuse our sweet mother for being more civilized than himself.” “Shame, Ebbo!” cried Friedel, “or art thou but in jest?” “So far in jest that thou wilt never go, puissant Sir Hildebert,” returned Ebbo, drawing him closer.  “Thou wilt learn—as I also trust to do—in what nameless hole the serpent hid his remains.  Then shall they be duly coffined and blazoned.  All the monks in the cloisters for twenty miles round shall sing requiems, and thou and I will walk bareheaded, with candles in our hands, by the bier, till we rest him in the Blessed Friedmund’s chapel; and there Lucas Handlein shall carve his tomb, and thou shalt sit for the likeness.” “So may it end,” said Friedel, “but either I will know him dead, or endeavour somewhat in his behalf.  And that the need is real, as well as the purpose blessed, I have become the more certain, for, Ebbo, as I rose to descend the hill, I saw on the cloud our patron’s very form—I saw myself kneel before him and receive his blessing.” Ebbo burst out laughing.  “Now know I that it is indeed as saith Schleiermacher,” he said, “and that these phantoms of the Blessed Friedmund are but shadows cast by the sun on the vapours of the ravine. See, Friedel, I had gone to seek thee at the chapel, and meeting Father Norbert, I bent my knee, that I might take his farewell blessing.  I had the substance, thou the shadow, thou dreamer!” Friedel was as much mortified for the moment as his gentle nature could be.  Then he resumed his sweet smile, saying, “Be it so!  I have oft read that men are too prone to take visions and special providences to themselves, and now I have proved the truth of the saying.” “And,” said Ebbo, “thou seest thy purpose is as baseless as thy vision?” ",clouds stone quarry high mountain direct road bring water side castle profit road accessibility impregnability lessen friendly harbour robber crag case need communication destroy block stone bring wooden shed erect workmen meadow tiding amputation diseased limb die free use melon fever consequent operation death likely much change government leave son time title confer coronation receive collect troops deliverance horde invade send intimation swabian new sovereign pleased homage pay camp head armed retainer way enterprise honour open last young baron prepare equipp vassal send man arm pay lance contingent decide spend time absence son escort way camp last busy day summer evening sit castle step listen eager talk plan interesting hero bridge obtain full recognition claim debateable busy workmen usual leave grow restless want exclaim musing fit stay night tarn fetch set quest pass hamlet chapel way find way tarn meet brother wear beamy awestruck bring mountain height steadfast expression resolute purpose face dreamer seek cloud tarn throw arm brother neck boyish fashion dear long gray depth more manifold time mere miscreant horde glory gain peril leave purple hollow heaven light peak cleave sky more mind resolution old monkish fancy cry art swear true knight monkish fancy convinced duty strive ascertain father fate hold charge dead man growl proper quest return camp possible learn man father man survive son teutonic knight different mould bring light prove aver conscience rest dungeon impossible man pine year dark vault waste whole life free joyous own mountain irk bind heather gaze star serpent dare cry mere folly summon castle ear believe scarce haunt description kindly chain deck galley dreamt recollect prediction fret dark cheeked woman knowledge captive start resume former tone begin errantry garden care such quest end mortal conflict unknown father son least mother son ransom ply oar stead fine exchange mother laugh lose sublimate self rude savage lord undo work rate misuse sweet mother civilized cry art jest jest return draw close learn trust nameless hole serpent hide remains coffine blazon monk cloister mile sing requiem walk barehead candle hand bier rest blessed chapel carve tomb sit likeness end dead endeavour behalf need real purpose bless become certain rise descend hill cloud patron form kneel receive blessing burst laugh phantom bless shadow cast sun vapour ravine seek chapel meet bend knee farewell blessing substance shadow dreamer mortified moment gentle nature resume sweet smile read man prone vision special providence prove truth saying seest purpose baseless vision
