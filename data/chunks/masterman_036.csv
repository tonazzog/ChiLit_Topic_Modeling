"""Well, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, after breakfast, ""which is to be our next job?"" ""Why, sir, I think we had better all set to, to collect the branches and ends of the cocoa-nut trees cut down, and stack them for fuel.  Tommy and Juno have already made a good large pile, and I think, by to-night, we shall have made the stack, and so arranged it that the rain will not get into it much.  After that, as the weather will not permit us to leave the house for any time, we will cut our salt-pan and make our fish-pond; they will take a week at least, and then we shall have little more to do near home.  I think the strength of the rains is over already, and perhaps in a fortnight we may venture to walk through the wood, and examine what we have saved from the wreck."" ""And we are to explore the island; are we not, Ready?"" said William.  ""I long to do that."" ""Yes, William, but that must be almost the last job; for we shall be away for two or three nights, perhaps, and we must look out for fine weather.  We will, however, do that before we bring the stores round in the boat."" ""But how are we to make the salt-pan, Ready?  We must cut it out of the solid rock."" ""Yes, William; but I have three or four of what they call cold chisels, and with one of them and a hammer, we shall get on faster than you think; for the coral rock, although hard at the surface, is soft a little below it."" The whole of that day was employed in piling up the cocoa-nut branches and wood.  Ready made a square stack, like a haystack, with a gable top, over which he tied the long branches, so that the rain would pour off it. ""There,"" said Ready, as he came down the ladder, ""that will be our provision for next year; we have quite enough left to go on with till the rainy season is over, and we shall have no difficulty in collecting it afterwards when the weather is dry."" Mr Seagrave sighed and looked grave; Ready observed it, and said, ""Mr Seagrave, it is not that we may want it; but still we must prepare for the next rainy season, in case we do want it.  That Captain Osborn, if he lives, will send to look for us, I have no doubt; nay, I believe that Mackintosh will do the same; but still you must not forget that they all may have perished, although we have been so mercifully preserved.  We must put our trust in God, sir."" ""We must, Ready; and if it is his will, we must not murmur.  I have schooled myself as much as possible; but thoughts will come in spite of my endeavours to restrain them."" ""Of course they will, sir; that's natural: however, sir, you must hope for the best; fretting is no good, and it is sinful."" ""I feel it is, Ready; and when I see how patient, and even happy, my wife is under such privations, I am angry with myself."" ""A woman, sir, bears adversity better than a man.  A woman is all love, and if she has but her husband and children with her, and in good health, she will make herself happy almost anywhere: but men are different: they cannot bear being shut out of the world as you are now."" ""It is our ambition which makes us unhappy, Ready,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""but let us say no more about it: God must dispose of me as he thinks fit."" After supper, Ready, being requested by William, continued his narrative. ""I left off, if I recollect right, William, just as the Hottentot, with the cattle under his care, had frightened away the baboons who were tormenting us.  Well, we came out of the cave and sat down under the rock, so that the Hottentot could not see us, and we had a sort of council of war.  Romer was for going back and giving ourselves up again; for he said it was ridiculous to be wandering about without any arms to defend ourselves against wild beasts, and that we might fall in with something worse than the baboons very soon; and he was right.  It would have been the wisest thing which we could have done; but Hastings said, that if we went back we should be laughed at, and the idea of being laughed at made us all agree that we would not.  Bear this in mind, William, and never let the fear of ridicule induce you to do what is wrong; or if you have done wrong, prevent you from returning to what is your duty."" ""Many thanks for your advice, Ready; I hope William will not forget it,"" said Mr Seagrave. ""Well, sir, such was our reason for not giving up our mad scheme; and having so decided, the next point of consultation between us was, how we were to procure arms and ammunition, which we could not do without.  As we were talking this over, I peeped from behind the rock to see where the Hottentot might be; I perceived that he had laid himself down, and wrapped himself up in his kross, a mantle of sheep-skins which they always wear.  Now we had observed that he carried his musket in his hand, when we first saw him, as the Hottentots always go out armed, and I pointed out to Hastings and Romer that if he was asleep, we might get possession of his musket without his perceiving it.  This was a good idea, and Hastings said he would crawl to him on his hands and knees, while we remained behind the rock.  He did so very cautiously, and found the man's head covered up in his kross and fast asleep; so there was no fear, for the Hottentots are very hard to wake at any time; that we knew well.  Hastings first took the musket and carried it away out of the reach of the Hottentot, and then he returned to him, cut the leather thong which slung his powder-horn and ammunition, and retreated with all of them without disturbing the man from his sleep.  We were quite overjoyed at this piece of good luck, and determined to walk very cautiously some distance from where the Hottentot lay, that in case he awoke he should not see us.  Keeping our eyes about in every direction, lest we should meet with anybody else, we proceeded nearly a mile towards Table Bay, when we fell in with a stream of water.  This was another happy discovery, for we were very thirsty; so we concealed ourselves near the stream after we had quenched our thirst, and made a dinner off the provisions we had brought with us."" ""But, Ready, did you not do wrong to steal the Hottentot's musket?"" ""No, William; in that instance it could not be considered as a theft. We were in an enemy's country, trying to escape; we were therefore just as much at war with the country as we were when they took us prisoners, and we no more stole the musket than they could be said to have stolen our ship.  Am I not right, Mr Seagrave?"" ""I believe you are justified in what may seem extreme acts for the recovery of your liberty, after you have been made prisoners.  It has always been so considered."" ""Well, sir, to go on: we waited till dusk, and then we continued our march towards False Bay as fast as we could.  We knew that there were farmers down in the valley, or rather on the sides of the hills, and we hoped to obtain, by some means or other, two more muskets.  It was near twelve o'clock at night, with a bright moon, when we had a sight of the water in False Bay, and soon afterwards we heard the baying of a large dog, and not far from us we distinguished two or three farmhouses, with their cattle-folds and orchards.  We then looked for a hiding-place, where we might remain till the morning; we found one between some large pieces of rock.  We agreed that one should watch while the other two slept; this Hastings undertook to do, as he was not inclined to sleep. At daylight he woke Romer and me, and we made our breakfast.  From the place we were concealed in, we had a bird's-eye view of the farmhouse, and of what was going on.
