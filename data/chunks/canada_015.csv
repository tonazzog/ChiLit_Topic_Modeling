" It was on the Saturday evening, when they had all assembled round the fire, for it was more cold than it had hitherto been, that the moaning of the wind among the trees of the forest announced a gale of wind from the northward. ""We shall have it soon,"" observed Martin, ""winter mostly comes in with a gale."" ""Yes; and this appears as if it would be a strong gale,"" replied Alfred. ""Hark! how the boughs of the trees are sawing and cracking against each other."" ""I reckon we may get our snow-shoes out of the store-house, John,"" said Martin, ""and then we shall see how you can get over the ground with them when you go hunting. You have not shot a moose yet."" ""Is the moose the same as the elk, Martin?"" said Henry. ""I do not think it is, sir; yet I've heard both names given to the animal."" ""Have you ever shot any?"" said Mrs. Campbell. ""Yes, ma'am; many a one. They're queer animals; they don't run like the other deer, but they trot as fast as the others run, so it comes to the same thing. They are very shy, and difficult to get near, except in the heavy snow, and then their weight will not allow them to get over it, as the lighter deer can; they sink up to their shoulders, and flounder about till they are overtaken. You see, Master Percival, the moose can't put on snow-shoes like we can, and gives us the advantage over the animal."" ""Are they dangerous animals, Martin?"" inquired Mary Percival. ""Every large animal is more or less dangerous when it turns to bay, miss. A moose's horns sometimes weigh fifty pounds, and it is a strong animal to boot; but it can't do anything when the snow is deep. You'll find it good eating, at all events, when we bring one in."" ""I'll bring one,"" said John, who was cleaning his rifle. ""I dare say you will as soon as you can manage your snow-shoes,"" replied Martin. ""The wind is getting up higher. I guess you'll not find your way back to Malachi's lodge, Master John, as you thought to do to-morrow morning."" ""It is certainly a dreadful night,"" observed Mrs. Campbell; ""and I feel the cold very sensibly."" ""Yes, ma'am; but as soon as the snow is down, you'll be warmer."" ""It is time to go to bed,"" observed Mr. Campbell, ""so put away your work: and, Henry, give me down the Bible."" During that night the gale increased to almost a hurricane; the trees of the forest clashed and crackled, groaned and sawed their long arms against each other, creating an unusual and almost appalling noise; the wind howled round the palisades and fluttered the strips of bark on the roof, and as they all lay in bed, they could not sleep from the noise outside, and the increased feeling of cold. It was also the first trial of this new house in severe weather, and some of the wakeful party were anxiously watching the result. Toward the morning the storm abated, and every thing was again quiet. In consequence of the restless night which they had passed they were not so early as usual. Emma and Mary, when they came out of their room, found Martin and Alfred up and very busy with shovels; and, to their astonishment, they perceived that the snow was at least three feet deep on the ground, and in some places had been drifted up higher than their heads. ""Why, Alfred!"" cried Emma; ""how shall we be able to go after the cows this morning? This is, indeed, winter come on with little warning."" ""It still snows,"" observed Mary; ""not much, indeed, but the sky is very black."" ""Yes, miss; we shall have some more of it yet,"" observed Martin. ""Mr. Campbell and Henry have gone to the store-house for more shovels, for we must work hard, and clear a footpath, and then get the snow up against the palisades."" ""What a sudden change,"" said Emma; ""I wish the sky would clear, and then I should not care."" ""It will to-morrow, Miss Emma, I dare say; but the snow must come down first."" Martin and Alfred had only time to clear a path to the store-house. Mr. Campbell and Henry returned with more shovels, and as soon as breakfast was over, they commenced work. As for Mary and Emma going to milk the cows, that was impossible. Martin undertook that task until they had cleared a pathway to the hunter's lodge, in which the animals were shut up every night. By the advice of Martin, the snow next the palisades was piled up against the palings like a wall, as high as they could reach or throw it, by which means they got rid of the snow about the house, and at the same time formed a barrier against the freezing winds which they had to expect. All worked hard; Percival and John were of great use, and even Mrs. Campbell and the girls assisted collecting the remainder of the snow, and clearing it off the window-sills and other parts. By noon the snow left off falling, the sky cleared up, and the sun shone bright, although it gave out but little warmth. After dinner they renewed their labors, and commenced clearing away a path to the lodge, where the cows were locked in, and before nightfall they had accomplished their task as far as the bridge over the stream, which was about half-way. It had been a day of great fatigue, and they were glad to retire to rest. Mrs. Campbell and the girls had put an additional supply of blankets and skins upon the beds, for the cold was now intense, and the thermometer stood far below the freezing point. The following morning they resumed their task; the sky was still unclouded, and the sun shone out clear and bright. By dinner-time the path to the cow house had been completed; and the men then employed themselves in carrying as much fire-wood as they could, before it was dark, within the palisades. ""Well,"" observed Alfred, ""now things may go on as usual within doors; and what have we to do out, Martin?"" ""You must first get on your snow-shoes, and learn to walk in them,"" observed Martin; ""or otherwise you'll be a prisoner as well as the ladies. You see, John, you're not at Malachi's lodge."" ""Go to-morrow,"" replied John. ""No; not to-morrow, for I must go with you,"" said Martin; ""I can not trust you for finding your way; and I can not go to-morrow nor the next day either. We must kill our beef to-morrow; there's no fear but it will keep all the winter now, and we shall save our hay."" ""My larder is but poorly furnished,"" observed Mrs. Campbell. ""Never mind, ma'am, we'll soon have something in it, which will save our beef. In another week you shall have it well stocked."" ""John,"" said Mr. Campbell, ""recollect you must not go away without Martin."" ""I won't,"" replied John. All the game in the larder having been consumed, they sat down to salt pork and some of the fish which had been cured. The latter was pronounced to be excellent. ""What is the name of this fish, Martin?"" ""It is called the white-fish,"" replied Martin, ""and I have heard gentry from the old country say that they have none better, if any so good.""
