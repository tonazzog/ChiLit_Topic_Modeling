"CHAPTER X.                                    A tale      Would rouse adventurous courage in a boy,      And make him long to be a mariner,      That he might rove the main.--SOUTHEY.  Etheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the Taylors at school on Sunday, but no Halls made their appearance, and, on inquiry, she was told, “Please ma’am, they said they would not come;” so Ethel condemned Granny Hall as “a horrid, vile, false, hypocritical old creature! It was no use having anything more to do with her.” “Very well,” said Richard; “then I need not speak to my father.” “Ritchie now! you know I meant no such thing!” “You know, it is just what will happen continually.” “Of course there will be failures, but this is so abominable, when they had those nice frocks, and those two beautiful eighteen-penny shawls! There are three shillings out of my pound thrown away!” “Perhaps there was some reason to prevent them. We will go and see.” “We shall only hear some more palavering. I want to have no more to say to--” but here Ethel caught herself up, and began to perceive what a happiness it was that she had not the power of acting on her own impulses. The twins and their little brother of two years old were christened in the afternoon, and Flora invited the parents to drink tea in the kitchen, and visit Lucy, while Ethel and Mary each carried a baby upstairs to exhibit to Margaret. Richard, in the meantime, had a conversation with John Taylor, and learned a good deal about the district, and the number of the people. At tea, he began to rehearse his information, and the doctor listened with interest, which put Ethel in happy agitation, believing that the moment was come, and Richard seemed to be only waiting for the conclusion of a long tirade against those who ought to do something for the place, when behold! Blanche was climbing on her father’s knee, begging for one of his Sunday stories. Etheldred was cruelly disappointed, and could not at first rejoice to see her father able again to occupy himself with his little girl. The narration, in his low tones, roused her from her mood of vexation. It was the story of David, which he told in language scriptural and poetical, so pretty and tender in its simplicity, that she could not choose but attend. Ever and anon there was a glance towards Harry, as if he were secretly likening his own “yellow-haired laddie” to the “shepherd boy, ruddy, and of a fair countenance.” “So Tom and Blanche,” he concluded, “can you tell me how we may be like the shepherd-boy, David?” “There aren’t giants now,” said Tom. “Wrong is a giant,” said his little sister. “Right, my white May-flower, and what then?” “We are to fight,” said Tom. “Yes, and mind, the giant with all his armour may be some great thing we have to do: but what did David begin with when he was younger?” “The lion and the bear.” “Ay, and minding his sheep. Perhaps little things, now you are little children, may be like the lion and the bear--so kill them off--get rid of them--cure yourself of whining or dawdling, or whatever it be, and mind your sheep well,” said he, smiling sweetly in answer to the children’s earnest looks as they caught his meaning, “and if you do, you will not find it near so hard to deal with your great giant struggle when it comes.” Ah! thought Ethel, it suits me as well as the children. I have a great giant on Cocksmoor, and here I am, not allowed to attack him, because, perhaps, I am not minding my sheep, and letting my lion and my bear run loose about the house. She was less impatient this week, partly from the sense of being on probation, and partly because she, in common with all the rest, was much engrossed with Harry’s fate. He came home every day at dinner-time with Norman to ask if Alan Ernescliffe’s letter had come; and at length Mary and Tom met them open-mouthed with the news that Margaret had it in her room. Thither they hastened. Margaret held it out with a smile of congratulation. “Here it is, Harry; papa said you were to have it, and consider it well, and let him know, when you had taken time. You must do it soberly. It is once for all.” Harry’s impetuosity was checked, and he took the letter quietly. His sister put her hand on his shoulder, “Would you mind my kissing you, dear Harry?” and as he threw his arms round her neck, she whispered, “Pray that you may choose right.” He went quietly away, and Norman begged to know what had been Alan Ernescliffe’s advice. “I can scarcely say he gave any direct advice,” said Margaret; “He would not have thought that called for. He said, no doubt there were hardships and temptations, more or less, according to circumstances; but weighing one thing with another, he thought it gave as fair a chance of happiness as other professions, and the discipline and regularity had been very good for himself, as well as for many others he had known. He said, when a man is willing to go wrong there is much to help him, but when he is resolved on doing right, he need not be prevented.” “That is what you may say of anything,” said Norman. “Just so; and it answered papa’s question, whether it was exposing Harry to more temptation than he must meet with anywhere. That was the reason it was such a comfort to have anyone to write to, who understands it so well.” “Yes, and knows Harry’s nature.” “He said he had been fortunate in his captains, and had led, on the whole, a happy life at sea; and he thought if it was so with him, Harry was likely to enjoy it more, being of a hardy adventurous nature, and a sailor from choice, not from circumstances.” “Then he advised for it? I did not think he would; you know he will not let Hector be a sailor.” “He told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it desirable, and that he believed Hector only wished it from imitation of him. He said too, long ago, that he thought Harry cut out for a sailor. “A spirited fellow!” said Norman, with a look of saddened pride and approval, not at all like one so near the same age. “He is up to anything, afraid of nothing, he can lick any boy in the school already. It will be worse than ever without him!” “Yes, you will miss your constant follower. He has been your shadow ever since he could walk. But there’s the clock, I must not keep you any longer; good-bye, Norman.” Harry gave his brother the letter as soon as they were outside the house, and, while he read it, took his arm and guided him. “Well,” said Norman as he finished. “It is all right,” said Harry; and the two brothers said no more; there was something rising up in their throats at the thought that they had very few more walks to take together to Bishop Whichcote’s school; Norman’s heart was very full at the prospect of another vacancy in his home, and Harry’s was swelling between the ardour of enterprise and the thought of bidding good-bye to each familiar object, and, above all, to the brother who had been his model and admiration from babyhood. “June!” at length he broke out, “I wish you were going too. I should not mind it half so much if you were.” “Nonsense, Harry! you want to be July after June all your life, do you? You’ll be much more of a man without me.” That evening Dr. May called Harry into his study to ask him if his mind was made up; he put the subject fairly before him, and told him not to be deterred from choosing what he thought would be for the best by any scruples about changing his mind. “We shall not think a bit the worse of you; better now, than too late.” There was that in his face and tone that caused Harry to say, in a stifled voice, “I did not think you would care so much, papa; I won’t go, if you do.” Dr. May put his hand on his shoulder, and was silent. Harry felt a strange mixture of hope and fear, joy and grief, disappointment and relief. “You must not give it up on that account, my dear,” he said at length; “I should not let you see this, if it did not happen at a time when I can’t command myself as I ought. If you were an only son, it might be your duty to stay; being one of many, ‘tis nonsense to make a rout about parting with you. If it is better for you, it is better for all of us; and we shall do very well when you are once fairly gone. Don’t let that influence you for a moment.” ", tale rouse adventurous courage boy mariner reve main satisfaction school hall appearance inquiry condemn horrid vile false hypocritical old creature use more speak father mean such thing happen course failure abominable nice frock beautiful penny shawl shilling pound throw reason prevent hear more palavering want more catch begin perceive happiness power act own impulse twin brother year old christen afternoon invite parent drink tea kitchen visit carry baby exhibit meantime conversation learn deal district number person tea begin rehearse information doctor listen interest put happy agitation believe moment seem wait conclusion long tirade place climb father knee begg story disappointed rejoice father able occupy girl narration low tone rouse mood vexation story language scriptural poetical pretty tender simplicity choose attend glance liken own yellow hair laddie shepherd boy ruddy fair countenance conclude shepherd boy giant wrong giant sister right white flower fight mind giant armour great thing begin young lion bear mind sheep thing child lion bear kill rid cure whining dawdling mind sheep smile answer child earnest catch meaning find hard deal great giant struggle suit child great giant allow attack mind sheep let lion bear run house impatient week sense probation common rest engross fate day dinner time ask letter length meet open mouthed news room hasten hold smile congratulation consider let time impetuosity check letter sister put hand shoulder mind kiss dear throw arm neck whisper pray choose right begg advice give direct advice call doubt hardship temptation more less accord circumstance weigh thing give fair chance happiness other profession discipline regularity many other man willing wrong much help resolve right prevent  answer papa question expose more temptation meet reason comfort write understand nature fortunate captain lead whole happy life sea likely enjoy hardy adventurous nature sailor choice circumstance advise let sailor strong natural bend way desirable believe wish imitation cut sailor spirit fellow sadden pride approval same age afraid lick boy school bad miss constant follower shadow walk clock keep give brother letter house read arm guide finish right brother more rise throat thought few more walk school heart full prospect vacancy home swell ardour enterprise thought bid bye familiar object brother model admiration babyhood length break wish mind half much nonsense want life more man evening call study ask mind put subject deterre choose scruple change mind bit bad late face tone cause stifle voice care much papa put hand shoulder silent feel strange mixture hope fear joy grief disappointment relief give account dear length let happen time command only son duty stay many nonsense rout part gone let influence moment
