"CHAPTER 5. THE RESCUE Shades of the dead, have I not heard your voices Rise on the night-rolling breath of the gale?--_Byron_  When I came to myself I was lying, not in the outer blackness of the Mohune vault, not on a floor of sand; but in a bed of sweet clean linen, and in a little whitewashed room, through the window of which the spring sunlight streamed. Oh, the blessed sunshine, and how I praised God for the light! At first I thought I was in my own bed at my aunt's house, and had dreamed of the vault and the smugglers, and that my being prisoned in the darkness was but the horror of a nightmare. I was for getting up, but fell back on my pillow in the effort to rise, with a weakness and sick languor which I had never known before. And as I sunk down, I felt something swing about my neck, and putting up my hand, found 'twas Colonel John Mohune's black locket, and so knew that part at least of this adventure was no dream. Then the door opened, and to my wandering thought it seemed that I was back again in the vault, for in came Elzevir Block. Then I held up my hands, and cried-- 'O Elzevir, save me, save me; I am not come to spy.' But he, with a kind look on his face, put his hand on my shoulder, and pushed me gently back, saying-- 'Lie still, lad, there is none here will hurt thee, and drink this.' He held out to me a bowl of steaming broth, that filled the room with a savour sweeter, ten thousand times, to me than every rose and lily of the world; yet would not let me drink it at a gulp, but made me sip it with a spoon like any baby. Thus while I drank, he told me where I was, namely, in an attic at the Why Not?, but would not say more then, bidding me get to sleep again, and I should know all afterwards. And so it was ten days or more before youth and health had their way, and I was strong again; and all that time Elzevir Block sat by my bed, and nursed me tenderly as a woman. So piece by piece I learned the story of how they found me. 'Twas Mr. Glennie who first moved to seek me; for when the second day came that I was not at school, he thought that I was ill, and went to my aunt's to ask how I did, as was his wont when any ailed. But Aunt Jane answered him stiffly that she could not say how I did. 'For,' says she, 'he is run off I know not where, but as he makes his bed, must he lie on't; and if he run away for his pleasure, may stay away for mine. I have been pestered with this lot too long, and only bore with him for poor sister Martha's sake; but 'tis after his father that the graceless lad takes, and thus rewards me.' With that she bangs the door in the parson's face and off he goes to Ratsey, but can learn nothing there, and so concludes that I have run away to sea, and am seeking ship at Poole or Weymouth. But that same day came Sam Tewkesbury to the Why Not? about nightfall, and begged a glass of rum, being, as he said, 'all of a shake', and telling a tale of how he passed the churchyard wall on his return from work, and in the dusk heard screams and wailing voices, and knew 'twas Blackbeard piping his lost Mohunes to hunt for treasure. So, though he saw nothing, he turned tail and never stopped running till he stood at the inn door. Then, forthwith, Elzevir leaves Sam to drink at the Why Not? alone, and himself sets off running up the street to call for Master Ratsey; and they two make straight across the sea-meadows in the dark. 'For as soon as I heard Tewkesbury tell of screams and wailings in the air, and no one to be seen,' said Elzevir, 'I guessed that some poor soul had got shut in the vault, and was there crying for his life. And to this I was not guided by mother wit, but by a surer and a sadder token. Thou wilt have heard how thirteen years ago a daft body we called Cracky Jones was found one morning in the churchyard dead. He was gone missing for a week before, and twice within that week I had sat through the night upon the hill behind the church, watching to warn the lugger with a flare she could not put in for the surf upon the beach. And on those nights, the air being still though a heavy swell was running, I heard thrice or more a throttled scream come shivering across the meadows from the graveyard. Yet beyond turning my blood cold for a moment, it gave me little trouble, for evil tales have hung about the church; and though I did not set much store by the old yarns of Blackbeard piping up his crew, yet I thought strange things might well go on among the graves at night. And so I never budged, nor stirred hand or foot to save a fellow-creature in his agony. 'But when the surf fell enough for the boats to get ashore, and Greening held a lantern for me to jump down into the passage, after we had got the side out of the tomb, the first thing the light fell on at the bottom was a white face turned skyward. I have not forgot that, lad, for 'twas Cracky Jones lay there, with his face thin and shrunk, yet all the doited look gone out of it. We tried to force some brandy in his mouth, but he was stark and dead; with knees drawn up towards his head, so stiff we had to lift him doubled as he was, and lay him by the churchyard wall for some of us to find next day. We never knew how he got there, but guessed that he had hung about the landers some night when they ran a cargo, and slipped in when the watchman's back was turned. Thus when Sam Tewkesbury spoke of screams and wailings, and no one to be seen, I knew what 'twas, but never guessed who might be shut in there, not knowing thou wert gone amissing. So ran to Ratsey to get his help to slip the side stone off, for by myself I cannot stir it now, though once I did when I was younger; and from him learned that thou wert lost, and knew whom we should find before we got there.' I shuddered while Elzevir talked, for I thought how Cracky Jones had perhaps hidden behind the self-same coffin that sheltered me, and how narrowly I had escaped his fate. And that old story came back into my mind, how, years ago, there once arose so terrible a cry from the vault at service-time, that parson and people fled from the church; and I doubted not now that some other poor soul had got shut in that awful place, and was then calling for help to those whose fears would not let them listen. 'There we found thee,' Elzevir went on, 'stretched out on the sand, senseless and far gone; and there was something in thy face that made me think of David when he lay stretched out in his last sleep. And so I put thee on my shoulder and bare thee back, and here thou art in David's room, and shalt find board and bed with me as long as thou hast mind to.' We spoke much together during the days when I was getting stronger, and I grew to like Elzevir well, finding his grimness was but on the outside, and that never was a kinder man. Indeed, I think that my being with him did him good; for he felt that there was once more someone to love him, and his heart went out to me as to his son David. Never once did he ask me to keep my counsel as to the vault and what I had seen there, knowing, perhaps, he had no need, for I would have died rather than tell the secret to any. Only, one day Master Ratsey, who often came to see me, said-- ",chapter rescue shade dead hear voice rise night roll breath gale lie outer blackness vault floor sand bed sweet clean linen whitewash room window spring sunlight stream bless sunshine praise light first own bed aunt house dream vault smuggler prison darkness horror nightmare fall pillow effort rise weakness sick languor sink feel swing neck put hand find black locket part least adventure dream door open wonder seem vault hold hand cry save save spy kind face put hand shoulder push lie hurt drink hold bowl steaming broth fill room savour sweeter time rose lily world let drink gulp sip spoon baby drink attic bid sleep day more youth health way strong time sit bed nurse woman piece piece learn story find move seek second day school ill aunt ask ail answer run bed lie run pleasure stay pester lot bear poor sister sake father graceless lad reward bang door parson face learn conclude run sea seek ship same day nightfall begg glass rum shake tale pass churchyard wall return work dusk hear scream wail voice twat pipe lose hunt treasure turn tail stop run stand inn door leave drink set run street call sea meadow dark hear scream wailing air guess poor soul shut vault cry life guide mother wit surer sadder token hear year daft body call find morning churchyard dead miss week week sit night hill church watch warn lugger flare put surf beach night air heavy swell run hear thrice throttle scream shiver meadow graveyard turn blood cold moment give trouble evil tale hang church set much store old yarn pipe crew strange thing grave night budge stirr hand foot save fellow creature agony surf fall boat hold lantern jump passage side tomb first thing light fall bottom white face turn forget twa lay face thin shrink doited try force brandy mouth stark dead knee draw head stiff lift double lay churchyard wall find next day guess hang lander night run cargo slip watchman back turn speak scream wailing guess shut amissing run help slip side stone stir young learn lose find shudder talk hide self same coffin shelter escape fate old story mind year arise terrible cry vault service time parson person flead church doubt other poor soul shut awful place call help fear let listen find stretch sand senseless gone face lay stretch last sleep put shoulder bear back art room find board bed mind speak day strong grow like find grimness outside kind man feel more love heart son ask keep counsel vault need die secret day
