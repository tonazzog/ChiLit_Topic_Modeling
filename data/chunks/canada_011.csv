" We must pass over six weeks, during which the labor was continued without intermission, and the house was raised, of logs, squared and well fitted; the windows and doors were also put in, and the roof well covered in with large squares of birch-bark, firmly fixed on the rafters. The house consisted of one large room, as a dining-room, and the kitchen, with a floor of well-beaten clay, a smaller room, as a sitting-room, and three bedrooms, all of which were floored; one of the largest of them fitted all round with bed-places against the walls, in the same way as on board of packets; this room was for the four boys, and had two spare bed-places in it. The others, which were for the two girls and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, were much smaller. But before the house was half built, a large outhouse adjoining to it had been raised to hold the stores which Mr. Campbell had brought with him, with a rough granary made above the store-room. The interior of the house was not yet fitted up, although the furniture had been put in, and the family slept in it, rough as it was, in preference to the tents, as they were very much annoyed with musquitoes. The stores were now safe from the weather, and they had a roof over their heads, which was the grand object that was to be obtained. The carpenters were still very busy fitting up the interior of the house, and the other men were splitting rails for a snake-fence and also selecting small timber for raising a high palisade round the premises. Martin had not been idle. The site of the house was just where the brushwood joined to the prairie, and Martin had been clearing it away and stacking it, and also collecting wood for winter fuel. It had been decided that the four cows, which had been driven round from the fort, should be housed during the winter in the small building on the other side of the stream, which had belonged to Malachi Bone, as it was surrounded with a high snake-fence, and sufficiently large to hold them and even more. The commandant had very kindly selected the most quiet cows to milk, and Mary and Emma Percival had already entered upon their duties: the milk had been put into the store-house until a dairy could be built up. A very neat bridge had been thrown across the stream, and every morning the two girls, generally attended by Henry, Alfred, or Captain Sinclair, crossed over, and soon became expert in their new vocation as dairy-maids. Altogether, things began to wear a promising appearance. Henry and Mr. Campbell had dug up as fast as Martin and Alfred cleared away the brushwood, and the garden had already been cropped with such few articles as could be put in at the season. The commandant had some pigs ready for the settlers as soon as they were ready to receive them, and had more than once come up in the boats to ascertain their progress and to offer any advice that he might consider useful. We must not, however, forget Malachi Bone. The day after Bone had come to Mr. Campbell, Emma perceived him going away into the woods, with his rifle, followed by her cousin John, and being very curious to see his Indian wife, she persuaded Alfred and Captain Sinclair to accompany her and Mary to the other side of the stream. The great point was to know where to cross it, but as John had found out the means of so doing, it was to be presumed that there was a passage, and they set off to look for it. They found that, about half a mile up the stream, which there ran through the wood, a large tree had been blown down and laid across it, and with the assistance of the young men, Mary and Emma passed it without much difficulty; they then turned back by the side of the stream until they approached the lodge of old Malachi. As they walked toward it, they could not perceive any one stirring; but at last a dog of the Indian breed began to bark; still nobody came out, and they arrived at the door of the lodge where the dog stood; when, sitting on the floor, they perceived the Indian girl whom they were in search of. She was very busy sewing a pair of moccasins out of deer leather. She appeared startled when she first saw Alfred; but when she perceived that the young ladies were with him, her confidence returned. She slightly bowed her head, and continued her work. ""How very young she is,"" said Emma; ""why she can not be more than eighteen years old."" ""I doubt if she is so much,"" replied Captain Sinclair. ""She has a very modest, unaffected look, has she not, Alfred?"" said Mary. ""Yes; I think there is something very prepossessing in her countenance."" ""She is too young a wife for the old hunter, at all events,"" observed Alfred. ""That is not unusual among the Indians,"" said Captain Sinclair; ""a very old chief will often have three or four young wives; they are to be considered more in the light of his servants than any thing else."" ""But she must think us very rude to talk and stare at her in this manner; I suppose she can not speak English."" ""I will speak to her in her own language, if she is a Chippeway or of any of the tribes about here, for they all have the same dialect,"" said Captain Sinclair. Captain Sinclair addressed her in the Indian language, and the Indian girl replied in a very soft voice. ""She says her husband is gone to bring home venison."" ""Tell her we are coming to live here, and will give her any thing she wants."" [MALACHI AND HIS WIFE.] Captain Sinclair again addressed her, and received her answer. ""She says that you are beautiful flowers, but not the wild flowers of the country, and that the cold winter will kill you."" ""Tell her she will find us alive next summer,"" said Emma; ""and, Captain Sinclair, give her this brooch of mine, and tell her to wear it for my sake."" Captain Sinclair gave the message and the ornament to the Indian girl, who replied, as she looked up and smiled at Emma, ""That she would never forget the beautiful lily who was so kind to the little strawberry-plant."" ""Really her language is poetical and beautiful,"" observed Mary; ""I have nothing to give her--Oh! yes, I have; here is my ivory needle-case, with some needles in it. Tell her it will be of use to her when she sews her moccasins. Open it and show her what is inside."" ""She says that she will be able to work faster and better, and wishes to look at your foot, that she may be grateful; so put your foot out, Miss Percival."" Mary did so; the Indian girl examined it, and smiled and nodded her head. ""Oh, Captain Sinclair, tell her that the little boy who is gone with her husband is our cousin."" Captain Sinclair reported her answer, which was, ""He will be a great hunter and bring home plenty of game by and by.""
