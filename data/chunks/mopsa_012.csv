"CHAPTER XII. THEY RUN AWAY FROM OLD MOTHER FATE.   A land that living warmth disowns,     It meets my wondering ken;   A land where all the men are stones,     Or all the stones are men.  Before the apple-woman had finished, Jack and Mopsa saw the Queen coming in great state, followed by thousands of the one-foot-one fairies, and leading by a ribbon round its neck a beautiful brown doe. A great many pretty fawns were walking among the fairies. ""Here's the deputation,"" said the apple-woman; but as the Guinea-fowl rose like a cloud at the approach of the Queen, and the fairies and fawns pressed forward, there was a good deal of noise and confusion, during which Mopsa stepped up close to Jack, and whispered in his ear, ""Remember, Jack, whatever you can do you may do."" Then the brown doe laid down at Mopsa's feet, and the Queen began:-- ""Jack and Mopsa, I love you both. I had a message last night from my old mother, and I told you what it was."" ""Yes, Queen,"" said Mopsa, ""you did."" ""And now,"" continued the Queen, ""she has sent this beautiful brown doe from the country beyond the lake, where they are in the greatest distress for a queen, to offer Mopsa the crown; and, Jack, it is fated that Mopsa is to reign there, so you had better say no more about it."" ""I don't want to be a queen,"" said Mopsa, pouting; ""I want to play with Jack."" ""You are a queen already,"" answered the real Queen; ""at least, you will be in a few days. You are so much grown, even since the morning, that you come up nearly to Jack's shoulder. In four days you will be as tall as I am; and it is quite impossible that any one of fairy birth should be as tall as a queen in her own country."" ""But I don't see what stags and does can want with a queen,"" said Jack. ""They were obliged to turn into deer,"" said the Queen, ""when they crossed their own border; but they are fairies when they are at home, and they want Mopsa, because they are always obliged to have a queen of alien birth."" ""If I go,"" said Mopsa, ""shall Jack go too?"" ""Oh, no,"" answered the Queen; ""Jack and the apple-woman are my subjects."" ""Apple-woman,"" said Jack, ""tell us what you think; shall Mopsa go to this country?"" ""Why, child,"" said the apple-woman, ""go away from here she must; but she need not go off with the deer, I suppose, unless she likes. They look gentle and harmless; but it is very hard to get at the truth in this country, and I've heard queer stories about them."" ""Have you?"" said the Queen. ""Well, you can repeat them if you like; but remember that the poor brown doe cannot contradict them."" So the apple-woman said, ""I have heard, but I don't know how true it is, that in that country they shut up their queen in a great castle, and cover her with a veil, and never let the sun shine on her; for if by chance the least little sunbeam should light on her she would turn into a doe directly, and all the nation would turn with her, and stay so."" ""I don't want to be shut up in a castle,"" said Mopsa. ""But is it true?"" asked Jack. ""Well,"" said the apple-woman, ""as I told you before, I cannot make out whether it's true or not, for all these stags and fawns look very mild, gentle creatures."" ""I won't go,"" said Mopsa; ""I would rather run away."" All this time the Queen with the brown doe had been gently pressing with the crowd nearer and nearer to the brink of the river, so that now Jack and Mopsa, who stood facing them, were quite close to the boat; and while they argued and tried to make Mopsa come away, Jack suddenly whispered to her to spring into the boat, which she did, and he after her, and at the same time he cried out,-- ""Now, boat, if you are my boat, set off as fast as you can, and let nothing of fairy birth get on board of you."" No sooner did he begin to speak than the boat swung itself away from the edge, and almost in a moment it was in the very middle of the river, and beginning to float gently down with the stream. [THEY RUN AWAY FROM OLD MOTHER FATE. ""The boat swung itself away from the edge, and almost in a moment it was in the very middle of the river.""--PAGE 162.] Now, as I have told you before, that river runs up the country instead of down to the sea, so Jack and Mopsa floated still farther up into Fairyland; and they saw the Queen, and the apple-woman, and all the crowd of fawns and fairies walking along the bank of the river, keeping exactly to the same pace that the boat went; and this went on for hours and hours, so that there seemed to be no chance that Jack and Mopsa could land; and they heard no voices at all, nor any sound but the baying of the old hound, who could not swim out to them, because Jack had forbidden the boat to take anything of fairy birth on board of her. Luckily the bottom of the boat was full of those delicious flowers that had dropped into it at breakfast-time, so there was plenty of nice food for Jack and Mopsa; and Jack noticed, when he looked at her towards evening, that she was now nearly as tall as himself, and that her lovely brown hair floated down to her ankles. ""Jack,"" she said, before it grew dusk, ""will you give me your little purse that has the silver fourpence in it?"" Now Mopsa had often played with this purse. It was lined with a nice piece of pale green silk, and when Jack gave it to her she pulled the silk out, and shook it, and patted it, and stretched it, just as the Queen had done, and it came into a most lovely cloak, which she tied round her neck. Then she twisted up her long hair into a coil, and fastened it round her head, and called to the fire-flies which were beginning to glitter on the trees to come, and they came and alighted in a row upon the coil, and turned into diamonds directly. So now Mopsa had got a crown and a robe, and she was so beautiful that Jack thought he should never be tired of looking at her; but it was nearly dark now, and he was so sleepy and tired that he could not keep his eyes open, though he tried very hard, and he began to blink, and then he began to nod, and at last he fell fast asleep, and did not awake till the morning. Then he sat up in the boat, and looked about him. A wonderful country, indeed!--no trees, no grass, no houses, nothing but red stones and red sand,--and Mopsa was gone. Jack jumped on shore, for the boat had stopped, and was close to the brink of the river. He looked about for some time, and at last, in the shadow of a pale brown rock, he found her; and oh! delightful surprise, the apple-woman was there too. She was saying, ""O my bones! Dearie, dearie me, how they do ache!"" That was not surprising, for she had been out all night. She had walked beside the river with the Queen and her tribe till they came to a little tinkling stream, which divides their country from the sandy land, and there they were obliged to stop; they could not cross it. But the apple-woman sprang over, and, though the Queen told her she must come back again in twenty-four hours, she did not appear to be displeased. Now the Guinea-hens, when they had come to listen, the day before, to the apple-woman's song, had brought each of them a grain of maize in her beak, and had thrown it into her apron; so when she got up she carried it with her gathered up there, and now she had been baking some delicious little cakes on a fire of dry sticks that the river had drifted down, and Mopsa had taken a honeycomb from the rock, so that they all had a very nice breakfast. And the apple-woman gave them a great deal of good advice, and told them if they wished to remain in Fairyland, and not be caught by the brown doe and her followers, they must cross over the purple mountains. ""For on the other side of those peaks,"" she said, ""I have heard that fairies live who have the best of characters for being kind and just. I am sure they would never shut up a poor queen in a castle.
