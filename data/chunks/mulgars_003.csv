" It was now, what with the snow and what with natural evening, growing quickly dark. The birds had ceased to sing; only the Munza night-jar rattled. Now near, now far away, the Mulla-mulgars heard the beasts of the forest beginning to range and roar in the gloom. Nod buttoned up his sheep's jacket, for there was a frost-mist beneath the trees. He was cold, and began to be tired and very homesick. But Thumb was broad and fat and prodigiously strong, Thimble lean and sinewy. And when Thumb saw that Nod went stumbling under his bundle, he said: ""Give it to me, Mulla-jugguba!"" (Prince of Bonfires). And Thimble laughed. But Nod refused to give up his bundle, and trudged on behind his brothers, until night came down in earnest. Then, when it was quite dark, after listening and muttering together, they thought that if they spent the night down here they would certainly sleep ""in danger."" So Thumb clambered into a great Ollaconda-tree, and let down a rope or twist of the thick creeper called Cullum, and drew up all three bundles. Then Thimble pushed and Thumb pulled, and up went Nod, too stiff and cold to climb up by himself, after the bundles, sheep's-jacket and all. Then Thimble climbed up too. They made their supper of Mulgar-bread and frost-cockled Mambel-berries, which are sour and quench the thirst, and drank or sucked splinters of ice, plenty of which hung glassy in the great, still, winter-troubled tree. And for fear of leopards (or ""Roses,"" as their Munza name signifies), they agreed to keep watch in turn, Thumb first, then Thimble, then Nod. They tied their bundles to the boughs, chose smooth forks to squat in, and soon Thimble was fast asleep. But when Nod found himself alone in the midst of the great icy tree in the black forest, he could not sleep for thinking of it. He stroked his face with his brown hand over and over to keep his eyes shut. He nuzzled down into his sheep's-jacket. He counted his fingers again and again. He repeated the lingo of the Seventy-seven Travellers from beginning to end. It was in vain. Far and near he heard the cries and wanderings of the forest beasts; the Ollaconda-tree was full of the nests of the weaver-birds; and, worse still, soon Thimble began to snore so loud and so sorrowfully that poor Nod trembled where he sat. He could bear himself no longer. He stooped forward and called softly: ""Thumb, my brother, are you awake, Thumb?"" ""Sleep on, little Ummanodda,"" said Thumb; ""if I watch, I watch."" ""But I cannot sleep,"" said Nod; ""these weavers chatter so."" Thumb laughed. ""Thimble sings in his dreams,"" he said. ""Why shouldn't the little tailors sing, too?"" ""Do you think any leopards will come?"" said Nod. ""Think good things, my brother, not bad,"" Thumb answered. ""But this we will do--wait a little while awake, and I will sleep, and as soon as sleep begins to come, call me and wake me; then, little brother, you shall sleep in peace till morning."" He put his head under his arm without waiting for an answer; and soon, even louder and more dismal than Thimble's, rose Thumb's snoring into the Ollaconda-tree. Nod sat cold and stiff, his eyes stretched open, his ears twitching. And a thin moonlight began to tremble between the leaves. The light cheered his spirits, and he thought, ""Nod will soon feel sleepy now,"" when suddenly out of the gloom of the forest burst a sounder or drove of wild pig, scuffling and chuggling beneath the tree. Peeping down, Nod could just see them in the faint moonshine, with their long, black, hairy ears and tufted tails. And presently, while they were grubbing in the snow, one lifted up its snout and cried in a loud voice: ""Co-older--and colder!"" ""Co-older--and colder,"" cried another. ""Co-older--and colder,"" cried a third. And all silently grubbed on as before. ""The Queen of the Mountains is in the Forest,"" began the first again, ""with fingers of frost."" ""And shoulders of snow.""     [""THE QUEEN OF THE MOUNTAINS IS IN THE FOREST ... WITH     FINGERS OF FROST.""] ""And feet of ice,"" screamed the third. ""The Queen of the Mountains,"" they grunted all together; and went on burrowing, and shouldering, and faintly squeaking. ""Hungrier and hungrier,"" cried one in a shrill voice, suddenly lifting its head, so that Nod could see quite clearly its pale green, greedy slits of eyes. ""Leaner and leaner,"" answered another. ""All the Sudd hid, all the Ukkas gone, all the Bōōbab frozen!"" squealed a third. ""The Queen of the Mountains is in the Forest,"" they grunted all together. But the pig that had looked up into the tree was still staring--staring and wrinkling his narrow snout, till at last all the pigs stopped feeding. ""Pigs, my brothers; pigs, my brothers,"" he muttered. ""Up in this tree are Mulgar three, which travellers be.... Ho, there!"" But Nod thought it best to make no answer. And the pig turned round and beat with his hind-feet against the bole or trunk of the Ollaconda. ""Ho, there, little Mulgar in the sheep-skin coat!"" ""If you beat like that, horny-foot, you'll wake my brothers,"" said Nod. ""Brothers!"" said the pig angrily. ""What's brothers to Ukka-nuts? What's your names, and where are you going?"" ""My brothers' names,"" said Nod, ""are Thumma and Thimbulla, and I am Nod. We are going to the palace of ivory and Azmamogreel that is our Uncle Assasimmon's, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar."" At that all the pigs began muttering together. ""Come down and tell us!"" said a lean yellow pig; and as he snapped his jaws Nod saw in the moonbeam the frost-light blinking on his bristles. ""Tell you what?"" said Nod. ""About this Prince of Tishnar. Oh, these false-tongued Mulgars!"" Nod made no answer. Then a fat old she-pig began speaking in a soft, pleasant voice. ""You must be very, very rich, Prince Nod, with those great bags of nuts; and, surely, it must be royal Sudd I smell! And Assasimmon his uncle! whose house is more than a thousand pigs'-tails long; and gardens so thick with trees of fruit and honey, one groans to have only one stomach. Come down a little way, Prince Nod, and tell us poor hungry pigs of the royal Assasimmon and the dainty food he eats."" So pleasant was her flattering voice Nod thought there could not possibly be any harm in scrambling down just one or two branches. And though his fingers were still stiff with cold, he began to edge down. ""Oh, but bring a bundle--bring a bundle, little Prince. It's cold for gentlefolk sitting in the snow.""

"""Pigs--pigs must naked go; but not for gentlefolk the snow,"" squealed the herd shrilly. ""Come gently, Prince Nod; do not stir your royal brothers, Prince Nod!"" said the old crafty one. Nod listened to her flattery, and, having untied his precious bundle, he slid down with it softly to the ground. ""A seat--a seat for Prince Nod,"" cried the old sow. ""Oh, what a royal jacket--oh, what a handsome jacket!"" So Nod sat down on his bundle in the moonlight of the snow, and all the wild pig, scenting his Sudd, pressed close--forty wild pig at least. ""Assasimmon, Assasimmon, Prince of Tishnar, Prince of Tishnar,"" they kept grunting, and at every word they squeezed and edged closer and closer, their hungry snouts in air--closer and closer, till Nod had to hold tight to keep his seat; closer and closer, and again they began squealing: ""Pigs are hungry, brother Nod. Cakes of Sudd, cakes of _Sudd_!"" And then, like a great scrambling wave of pigs, they rushed at him all together. Over went Nod into the snow. Scores of little sharp hoofs scuttled over him. And when at last he was able to get up and look about him, bruised and scratched and breathless, no trace of pigs was there, no trace of bundle; every nut and crust of Sudd and crumb of pulpy Mulgar-bread was gone. And suddenly came a loud, harsh voice out of the tree. ""Ho, ho, and ahôh! What's the trouble? what's the trouble?"" Nod looked up, and saw Thumb and Thimble staring down between their out-stretched arms through the moon-silvery leaves. And he told them, trembling, of how he could not sleep, and about the pigs and the bundle. ""O most wise Nizza-neela!"" said Thumb when he had finished. ""Last night Mulla-jugguba; this night Nodda-nellipogo"" (Prince of Bonfires, Noddle of Pork). But Thimble was too sore to say anything, for his little Exxswixxia-book of sorcery had been stuffed into Nod's bundle, and now it was lost for ever. And they left Nod to climb up again by himself. Once safely back on his fork, he was so tired and miserable that, with his hands over his face, he fell almost directly fast asleep. When he opened his small clear eyes again, sunrise was glinting here and there through the green twilight on the icicles and snow in the trees. He looked down, and saw Thumb and Thimble combing themselves. So down he went, too, and took off his jacket, and skipped and frisked till he grew warm. Then he, too, combed himself, and went and sat down beside his brothers at the foot of the Ollaconda-tree to eat his morning's share of musty nuts. At first his brothers sat angry and sullen, munching with their great dog-teeth, and seeming to begrudge him every Ukka-nut he cracked. But as the daybeams brightened, here where the trees grew not so dense, and the birds, some wellnigh as small as acorns, flashed and zigzagged, and Parrakeetoes squeaked and screamed in hundreds on the branches, watching the three hungry travellers, they began to forget Nod's supper with the pigs. And when they had eaten, into the gloom of Munza they set out once more. As a dog smells out the footsteps of his master so these Mulla-mulgars seemed to smell out their way. No path was to be seen except where pig-droves had rambled by, or droves of Mullabruks and packs of Munza-dogs. And once Thumb, on a sudden, stood still, and pointed to the ground, opening his great grinning mouth, with its little wall of glistening teeth, and muttered, ""Roses!"" They stood together looking down at the frozen footprints of a mother-leopard and her cubs in the fresh-laid snow. Nod fancied, even, he could smell her breath on the icy air. After this they went forward more warily, but carried their cudgels with a bravery, looking very fierce in their red jackets and great caps of furry skins. And, after a while, the huge trees gathered in again, and soon arched loftily overhead as thick as thatch, so that it was all in a cold and sluggish gloom they walked, like the dusk of coming night. Nor, so thick was the leafy roof overhead, had any snow floated into its twilight. Only a rare frost shimmered on the spiky husks of fruit thrown down by the Tree-mulgars. Huge frozen ropes of Cullum and wild Pepper dangled in knots and loops from bough to bough, and sometimes a troop of Squirrel-tails or spidery Skeetoes swung lightly down these hoar-frost ropes, chattering and scolding at the three strangers. But though Thumb called to them in their own tongue. ""Ullalullaubbajub,"" or some such sounds as that, meaning, ""We are friends,"" they skipped off, hand, foot, and tail, into their leafy roofs and shadows, afraid of these cudgel-carrying travellers in their red jackets, who walked, like the dreaded Oomgar, heads in air. Yet Nod was glad even of such company as this, so silent was the forest. In this darkness they sat and ate their handful of food, with scorpions and speckled tree-spiders watching them from their holes, not knowing where the sun was, nor daring to kindle a fire with their fire-sticks for fear of the tree-shadows. And at night they slept huddled close together for warmth and safety, while Thumb and Thimble kept watch in turn. In this way many days passed almost without blink of sunlight. Once and again they would sidle over some pig-track, or stand, with club in hand, to watch a leopard pass. And often troops of Mulgars kept pace with them awhile, swinging from branch to branch, and chattering threats at the travellers. But most of the forest creatures, parched and famished by such a cold as had never fallen on Munza-mulgar before, had been driven down out of the forest in search of food and warmth. And often the travellers were compelled to search the bark of the trees and in the crevices of rocks and under stones, as do the Babbaboomas, and eat whatever creeping things they could find. Beside the dangling Skeetoes, and now and then father, mother, and chidderkins of some old sour-faced mournful Mullabruk, they saw few things living, except the little ivory-gnawing M'boko, Peekodillies, and poison-spiders. But many of these, too, had died of cold and hunger. And now, instead of the pale green and amber lamps of firefly and glowworm, burned only the fires of Tishnar's frost. Birds rarely ventured down into this snowy shadowland, except only the tiny Telateuties, blood-red as ladybirds, that ran chittering up the trees. These birds haunt only where daylight rarely steals, and it is said they talk with the tree-spirits, or giant Nōōmas, that roam these shades.
