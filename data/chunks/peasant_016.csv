"The royal family were placed for three days in a forsaken monastery, where four cells were allotted to them and their attendants.  There Madame Campan went to them on the 11th.  In one cell the king was having his hair dressed.  In another, the queen was weeping on a mean bed, attended by a woman, a stranger, but civil enough.  The children soon came in, and the queen lamented bitterly over them, mourning that they should be deprived of so fine an inheritance as this great kingdom; for she now knew, she said, that the monarchy was really coming to an end. She spoke of the kingdom, with its many millions of inhabitants, as she would have spoken of a landed estate with the animals upon it,--as a property with which monarchs ought to be able to do what they like. Such was her idea of royalty.  She lamented in this crisis over her boy's loss of the crown, as if that were the greatest of the misfortunes that awaited him--as if he could not possibly be happy anywhere but on the throne.  Such was her idea of human life.  She was brought up with such ideas, and was to be pitied, not blamed, for acting and feeling accordingly. She mentioned to Madame Campan her vexation at the king having been so eager about his dinner, and having eaten and drunk so heartily in the presence of malignant strangers, on that dreadful day, and in this miserable place.  She need not have minded this so much; for everybody now knew the king and his ways, and how he never dreamed, under any circumstances, of not eating and drinking as usual. The departure from the Tuileries had been so sudden that the family had at first only the clothes that they wore.  Louis would have wanted for clean linen, if the lady of the English ambassador had not kindly thought of the poor boy, and sent him some clothes. On the 13th, the family were removed to the prison of the Temple; and Madame Campan, and almost all the servants of the royal household, lost sight of their master and mistress for ever.  It was seven in the evening when the removal to the Temple took place; and then there was so much disputing about where the family should be accommodated, whether in the tower of the building or another part of it, that poor Louis, though overcome with sleep, had to sit up while his father and mother supped. At eleven o'clock Madame de Tourzel took him to the Tower, to find some place where he might go to rest.  When the others lay down, at one in the morning, there was no preparation made for their comfort.  The Princess Elizabeth, with her waiting-woman, slept in the kitchen. Louis, with his governess and lady-attendant, slept in the billiard-room.  It was all confusion and discomfort.  The next morning, Louis was taken to breakfast with his mother; and then all went together to see the best rooms in the Tower, and arrange how they were to be occupied. It soon became unnecessary to plan for so many people; for an order arrived for the royal attendants to be removed, to make room for a new set appointed by the Common Council.  The king and queen refused to be waited upon by strangers, who were, no doubt, to act as spies: but their own people were removed notwithstanding.  On the night of the 19th, the king's valets were carried off; and then the Princess de Lamballe, and Madame de Tourzel and her daughter, and even the waiting-women.  Louis was taken up, and carried to his mother's apartment, that he might not be left quite alone.  He probably slept after thus losing his governess a second time: but his mother and aunt did not.  They were too anxious to think of sleeping: too anxious to know what to believe, and whether, as they had been assured, they should see their companions again in the morning.  In the morning, instead of the ladies, came the news that they were all removed to another prison.  At nine o'clock, one of the king's valets reappeared.  He alone had been pronounced innocent of any offence, and permitted to return to his master. Clery, the Dauphin's valet at the Tuileries, had been on the watch for an opportunity of returning to his office, after having been left behind on the dreadful 10th of August, when his life had been in the utmost danger.  He now heard that the mayor was about to appoint two more servants to wait on the king and the dauphin; and he so earnestly entreated that he might be one, that he obtained the appointment.  No one was more pleased than Louis to see Clery again. It was on the 26th of August, at eight in the evening, that Clery entered once more upon his service.  The queen desired him to resume his attendance upon the Dauphin, and to unite with the king's valet in rendering the family as comfortable as they could.  The princesses had now been eight days without the attendance of their women; and their hair much needed proper combing and arranging.  At supper they asked Clery whether he could dress their hair.  His reply was, that he should be happy to do whatever they desired.  The officer on guard commanded him aloud to be more guarded in his replies.  Poor Clery was aghast at finding that he must not be civil in his expressions to his master and mistress. Clery did not devote himself exclusively to the service of the Dauphin; for there were at first few, and latterly no other servants than himself, except a man named Tison, and his wife, who did the rough work of the chambers for a time. The way in which the royal prisoners passed their days, for some few months, was as follows: The king rose at six in the summer, and at seven as winter came on.  He shaved himself, and then Clery dressed his hair, and finished his toilette.  The king retired to a small turret-chamber, which he made his study, and there kneeled at his prayers, and read religious books till nine o'clock, his guard always taking care that the door was half-open; so that the king could not even kneel to pray in entire privacy.-- Meantime Clery made the bed, and prepared the room for breakfast, and then went down to take up little Louis.  After washing and dressing him, he dressed the queen's hair, and then went to the other princesses, to do the same service for them.  This was the opportunity seized for telling the family any news he had been able to obtain of what was going on out of doors.  It was almost the only occasion on which he could speak without being overheard by the guards: and even this was contrived with caution.  Clery showed, by an appointed sign, that he had something to say; and one of the princesses engaged the guard at the door in conversation, while Clery whispered his news into the ear of the other, as he bent over her head, to dress her hair.--At nine, the princesses and Louis went up to the king's apartment to breakfast, when Clery waited upon them, making haste, when the meal was done, to go down and get the other beds made.  At ten, the whole family came down to the queen's apartment, and began the business of the day.  Louis said his geography lesson to his father, read history with his mother, and learned poetry by heart; and did his sums with his aunt.  His sister did her lessons at the same time.  Hers lasted till twelve, while Louis's were over by eleven, when he played by himself for an hour.  The queen generally worked at her tapestry-frame; but sometimes she wrote out extracts from books for her daughter's use.  When she did this, and when the young princess wrote out sums into her cyphering-book, the officer on guard used to stand looking over their shoulders, to see that they did not, under false pretences, carry on any secret correspondence.  It is believed that they did so, notwithstanding all this vigilance; but how they contrived it will probably never be known; for, of course, they have not told their plan, and their gaolers were not aware of it.

"At twelve o'clock the ladies changed their dress in the Princess Elizabeth's room, before going out to walk in the garden.  The king and queen did not relish this daily walk in the garden, because they rarely went without being insulted: but they persevered as long as the practice was permitted, for the sake of the children.  That Louis, particularly, might have air and exercise, they would have made a point of going out, in all but the very worst weather.  They were, however, allowed no choice.  Wet or dry, rain or shine, out they must go, at the same hour every day, because the outside guard was changed at that hour; and the officer chose to see, without trouble to himself, that the prisoners were all safe.  Several guards were always in attendance upon the steps of the family as they walked; and there was only one walk which they might enter, because workmen were rebuilding the walls in other parts of the inclosure.  Louis would thus have benefited little by the hour or two out of doors, if it had not been for good Clery, who seems to have found time to do everything that could serve or please the family. Clery went out with them every day, and kept Louis at play the whole time,--sometimes at football,--sometimes at quoits,--sometimes at running races. This daily walk did not long continue the practice of the family; and, though they thought it right not to give it up themselves, some of them were very glad when it was over.  Their gaoler treated them with intolerable insolence.  He would not stir till they reached the door they were to pass out at, and then made a prodigious jingling with his great bunch of keys, and kept them waiting, under pretence of not being able to find the key: then he made all the noise he could in drawing the bolts; and, stepping before them, stood in the doorway, with his long pipe in his mouth, with which he puffed smoke into the face of each of the princesses as she passed,--the guard bursting into loud laughs at each puff.  Wherever they went, the prisoners saw a guillotine, or a gallows, or some vile inscription chalked upon the walls.  One of these inscriptions was, ""Little cubs must be strangled.""  Others threatened death, in a gibing way, to the king or the queen.  Clery one day saw the king reading some such threat of death, and would have rubbed it out; but the king bade him let it alone. They had one object of interest in their walks, which, however, they were obliged to conceal.  Certain of their devoted friends obtained entrance to the houses whose back windows commanded this garden, and, though afraid to make signals, looked down upon the forlorn party with sympathy which was well understood.  Clery one day believed that Madame de Tourzel had watched them during their walk; a lady very like her had so earnestly followed Louis with her eyes through his play.  He whispered this to the Princess Elizabeth, who shed tears on hearing it; so persuaded had the royal family been that Madame de Tourzel had perished.--It was not she however: neither had she perished.  She was at one of her country estates, hoping that she was kindly remembered by the royal family, and forgotten by their enemies. One of the most important pieces of intelligence that reached them, they first learned in the course of their walk.  A woman at a window which overlooked the garden watched the moment when the guards turned their backs, and held up for an instant a large sheet of pasteboard, on which was written ""Verdun is taken.""  The Princess Elizabeth saw and read this.  The woman no doubt thought this good news; and perhaps they, too, were pleased that their friends and the foreign army were fairly in France, and had taken a town on the road to Paris: but we shall see how it turned out to be anything but good news.--After a few weeks they walked no more in the garden, and had only such air and exercise as they could obtain upon the leads of the Temple. From their walk they came in to dinner at two o'clock, where Clery was again ready to wait, when he became the only remaining servant.  This was the hour when Santerre the brewer, now commanding the National Guard of Paris, came daily, with two other officers, to examine all the apartments inhabited by the family.  The king sometimes spoke to him,-- the queen never. After dinner, the king and queen played piquet or backgammon; not because they could enjoy at present any amusement of the kind, but because they found means, while bending their heads together over the board, to say a few words unheard by the guard.  At four o'clock, the ladies and children left the king, as it was his custom to sleep at this hour.  At six Clery and Louis entered the apartment, and Clery gave the boy lessons in writing, and copied, at the king's desire, passages from the works of Montesquieu and others, for the use of the Dauphin.  Then Clery took Louis to his aunt's room, where they played at ball, and battledore and shuttlecock, till Louis's supper-time, at eight o'clock. Meanwhile the queen and the Princess Elizabeth read aloud, till eight o'clock, when they went to Louis, to sit beside him while he had his supper.  Then the king amused the children with riddles, which he had found in a collection of old newspapers.  All kindly exerted themselves to send Louis cheerful to bed.  He was too young, they thought, to lie down with so sad a heart as they each had every night in their prison. However busy Clery might be, he never failed to be in the king's little study at seven o'clock.  Regularly at that hour every evening, a crier stood in the street, close by the tower of the Temple, and proclaimed what had been done that day in the Assembly, the Magistrates' Hall, and in the army.  This crier was no doubt sent, or induced to stand in that particular place, by friends of the royal family.  In the little turret-room, while all was silent there, Clery could catch what the crier said: and he found means to whisper it to the queen when she had heard Louis say his prayers, and when Clery put him into bed. Louis had added to his prayer one for the safety and welfare of Madame de Tourzel.  He had so well learned the temper and feelings of the guards that were always about the family, that when one of them stood near enough to hear the words of his prayer, he repeated the parts in which persons were named in a whisper. At nine o'clock, Clery went down to wait at supper.  As the Dauphin was never to be left alone, while such guards stood about, his mother and aunt took it in turn to sit beside him; and Clery brought up supper for whichever of them it might be.  This afforded opportunity for a few more words of news, if there was any to tell. After supper the king attended his wife, sister, and daughter to the queen's apartment, shook hands with them as he said good-night, and retired to his little study, where he read till midnight.  The guard was changed at midnight; and the king would never go to rest till he knew who was to be on guard.  If it was a stranger, he would learn his name. This kept Clery up too.  After he had assisted the king to undress, he lay down on his small bed, which he had placed beside that of the king, in order to be at hand in case of danger.

"Such was the course of the weary days of this unhappy family's imprisonment.  The king does not seem to have been troubled by any suspicion that they were all here through his fault; and there was nothing in their conduct to remind him of it.  They could not but have felt it; but they probably did not blame, but only mourned over him. His quietness they called heroism, and his indolent content, patience. His worst weaknesses were hidden here, where there was nothing to be done.  The queen would have been better pleased if he had never spoken to any of their gaolers; but, upon the whole, they managed to persuade themselves and each other that he was a martyr suffering in piety and patience.  We should have thought better of him if he had shown himself capable of self-reproach for having done nothing in defence of his crown, his family, and friends, but much towards the destruction of all. If he had been brave and sincere, however ignorant and mistaken, his family would now have been in a condition of honour and safety, though perhaps exiles from France. These dreary days were varied by the arrival of bad news; never of good,--though the taking of Verdun at first looked like good news.  It does not appear to have occurred to the king that, though his brothers and other friends were nearer than they had been, his most deadly enemies were nearer still,--close round about him, and sure to be made more cruel by every alarm given them by his allies.  The nearer the army approached, the greater was the danger of the prisoners.  A few minutes after the Princess Elizabeth had read the words on the pasteboard, a new guard arrived, in a passion of fear and anger.  He bade them all go in; he arrested and carried off Clery's fellow-servant, whom they never saw again, though he got off with a month's imprisonment.  While the valet was packing up his clothes, the guard kept shouting to the king, ""The drum has beat to arms: the alarm-bell is ringing: the alarm-guns have been fired: the emigrants are at Verdun.  If they come here, we shall all perish; but you shall die first.""  On hearing this, Louis burst into an agony of tears, and ran out of the room.  His sister followed, and tried to comfort him.  He saw that his father was not frightened.  The king was full of hope; but there was more reason for Louis's terror than for his father's expectation of deliverance.  Many warnings of the kind occurred, but the king never believed them.  One of his guards said to him, one night, that if the invaders advanced, the whole royal family would certainly perish.  This man declared that many people pitied the little boy; but that, as the son of a tyrant, he must die with the rest. The fears of the disorderly people of Paris, who knew that they were ill prepared for an invasion, made them desperate; and they began murdering before the very gates of the prison, all whom they supposed to be the king's friends, and therefore their enemies.  It was not likely that the Princess de Lamballe should escape,--she who had been the superintendent of the royal household, and the intimate friend of the queen;--she who, after having been in safety in London, had gone back to France, to share the fortunes of her mistress and friend.  This news of the taking of Verdun cost her her life; and a multitude more were massacred during the next three days. In the night after the news came, the queen, who could not sleep, heard the drums rolling continually.  The next day, the 3rd of September, as she was sitting down to backgammon with, the king, at three o'clock, a great clamour was heard in the street.  The officer on guard in the room shut the window, and drew the curtains,--knowing well what was the matter.  Clery at this moment entered.  The queen asked him why he was not at dinner.  He replied that he was indisposed,--and well indeed he might feel so.  He had just sat down to dinner with Tison and his wife, when something was held up at the window which he knew at a glance to be the head of the Princess de Lamballe.  He ran to prevent the queen's hearing of it, if possible. The king asked some of the officers if his family were in danger; and was told that the people had heard that the royal prisoners had left the Temple, and were crying out for the king to appear at a window; but that this was not to be allowed, as the people must learn to have more confidence in their magistrates.  Meantime, curses of the queen were heard without; and one of the guard told her that the people wanted to show her her friend's head, that she might see how tyrants were to be served; and that if she did not go to the window, the people would come up to her. The queen dropped in a fainting-fit; and the brute left the room.  The Princess Elizabeth and Clery lifted the queen into an arm-chair; and Louis helped his sister to try to revive their mother.  He put his arms about her neck, and his tears fell upon her face.  When she revived, they were glad to see her shed tears.  They all went into the Princess Elizabeth's room, where the noise from without was less heard.  There the queen stood, silent and motionless, and apparently unaware of all that was said and done in the room.  Yet this was the time chosen by a messenger from the mayor for settling some accounts with the king.  This man, not understanding the queen's misery, thought, when he saw her lost and motionless, that she remained standing out of respect to him! The noise continued for two hours; and it is believed that the mob would have burst the doors, and murdered the family, if an officer of the magistrates had not fastened a tricolor ribbon across the great gate,--a symbol which the people always respected.  This officer made Clery pay, out of the king's money, for this ribbon, which cost somewhat less than two shillings. The queen had not slept the night before; this night, her daughter and sister heard her sobs the whole night through, while the continual roll of the distant drums prepared them for new horrors.  Nothing more occurred to alarm them, however, for some weeks; and it was long before they knew that the massacre which began on that dreadful day was carried on through the two next. Whatever hopes the king had from abroad soon grew fainter.  The army began to retreat before the end of September.  One of the reasons of this was that the king's brothers and friends had misled the sovereigns of other countries, by saying that the French nation generally were attached to the king, and that the country people would rise in his favour all along the line of march.  They may have believed this themselves: but it was a great mistake; and when the foreign forces entered France, they found the country people universally their enemies. They would not furnish food, or any other assistance, and deserted their homes to join the revolutionary forces.  Thus, the foreign troops could not get on; and before a month was out, they were retreating, having done the royal cause nothing but harm by taking Verdun.
