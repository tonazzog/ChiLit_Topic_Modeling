"CHAPTER XI. Little Meg's Baby The new year came, but Meg's father had not arrived.  Kitty was having a mad outburst, as if she had so long controlled herself that now it was necessary to break out into extra wickedness.  She came home late every night, very drunk, and shouting loud snatches of songs, which wakened up the inmates of the lower stories, and drew upon her a storm of oaths.  But she continued always good-natured and kind to Meg, and insisted upon having the daily charge of Robin and the baby, though Meg left them in her care with a very troubled and anxious spirit.  Things were looking very dark to the poor little woman; but she kept up as brave a heart as she could, waiting from day to day for that long-deferred coming of her father, in which she believed so firmly. It was a little later than usual one evening, for the days were creeping out since the new year, when Meg climbed wearily upstairs to Kitty's attic, in search of her children, but found that they were not there.  Mr Grigg told her that he had seen Kitty take them out with her in the afternoon; and even while he was speaking, Meg saw her staggering and rolling into the court, with the baby fast asleep in her drunken arms.  Meg took it from her without a word, and led Robin away upstairs.  Robin's face was flushed, and his hand was very hot; but the baby lay in her arms heavily, without any movement or sign of life, except that the breath came through her parted lips, and her eyelids stirred a little.  Meg locked the door of her attic, and laid her baby on the bed, while she lighted the fire and got their tea ready.  Robin looked strange, but he chattered away without ceasing, while he watched her set the things in readiness.  But the baby would not awake.  It lay quite still on Meg's lap, and she poured a little warm tea into its mouth, but it did not swallow it, only slept there with heavy eyelids, and moving neither finger nor foot, in a strange, profound slumber.  It was smaller and thinner than when mother died, thought Meg; and she lifted up the lifeless little hand to her lips, half hoping that its eyes would unclose a little more, and that sweet, loving smile, with which it always welcomed her return, would brighten its languid face. But baby was too soundly asleep to smile. Little Meg sat up all night, with the baby lying on her lap, moaning a little now and then as its slumbers grew more broken, but never lifting up its eyelids to look into her face and know it.  When the morning dawned it was still the same.  Could the baby be ill? asked Meg of herself.  It did not seem to be in any pain; yet she carried it to the door, and called softly for Kitty to come and look at it; but there was no reply, only from below came up harsh sounds of children screaming and angry women quarrelling.  Oaths and threats and shrieks were all the answer Meg's feeble cry received.  She sat down again on her mother's low chair before the fire, and made the baby comfortable on her lap; while Robin stood at her knee, looking down pitifully at the tiny, haggard, sleeping face, which Meg's little hand could almost cover.  What was she to do?  There was no one in Angel Court whom she dare call to her help.  Baby might even die, like the greater number of the babies born in that place, whose brief lives ended quickly, as if existence was too terrible a thing in the midst of such din and squalor.  At the thought that perhaps baby was going to die, two or three tears of extreme anguish rolled down little Meg's cheeks, and fell upon baby's face; but she could not cry aloud, or weep many tears. She felt herself falling into a stupor of grief and despair, when Robin laid his hand upon her arm. 'Why don't you ask God to waken baby?' he asked. 'I don't know whether it 'ud be a good thing,' she answered.  'Mother said she'd ask Him over and over again to let her take baby along with her, and that 'ud be better than staying here.  I wish we could all go to heaven; only I don't know whatever father 'ud do if he come home and found us all dead.' 'Maybe God'll take me and baby,' said Robbie thoughtfully, 'and leave you to watch for father.' 'I only wish baby had called me Meg once afore she went,' cried little Meg. The baby stirred a little upon her knees, and stretched out its feeble limbs, opening its blue eyes wide and looking up into her face with its sweet smile of welcome.  Then the eyelids closed again slowly, and the small features put on a look of heavenly calm and rest.  Meg and Robin gazed at the change wonderingly without speaking; but when after a few minutes Meg laid her hand gently upon the smooth little forehead, the same chill struck to her heart as when she had touched her mother's dead face. It did not seem possible to little Meg that baby could really be dead. She chafed its puny limbs, as she had seen her mother do, and walked up and down the room singing to it, now loudly, now softly; but no change came upon it, no warmth returned to its death-cold frame, no life to its calm face.  She laid it down at length upon the bed, and crossed its thin wee arms upon its breast, and then stretching herself beside it, with her face hidden from the light, little Meg gave herself up to a passion of sorrow. 'If I'd only asked God, for Christ's sake,' she cried to herself, 'maybe He'd have let baby wake, though I don't know whether it's a good thing.  But now she's gone to mother, and father'll come home, and he'll find nobody but me and Robbie, and the money safe.  Oh!  I wish I'd asked God.' 'Meg,' said Robin, after she had worn herself out with sobs and tears, and was lying silently beside baby, 'I'm very poorly.  I think I'll go to live with the angels, where mother and baby are gone.' Meg started up, and gazed anxiously at Robin.  His bright eyes were dimmed, and his face was flushed and heavy; he was stretched on the floor near the fire, in a listless attitude, and did not care to move, when she knelt down beside him, and put her arm under his head.  It ached, he said; and it felt burning hot to her touch.  Meg's heart stood still for a moment, and then she dropped her tear-stained sorrowful face upon her hands. 'Pray God,' she cried, 'don't take Robbie away as well as baby.  Maybe it wasn't a good thing for baby to stay, now mother's dead, though I've done everythink I could, and there's been nobody to take care of us but You.  But, pray God, do let Robbie stay with me till father comes home; for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.'
