"CHAPTER 18. A HOLIDAY ADVENTURE. When a big school like Saint Dominic's is gathered together within the comparatively narrow compass of four walls, there _is_ some possibility of ascertaining how it prospers, and what events are interesting it. But when the same school is scattered to the four winds of heaven during the holidays, it would require a hundred eyes and more to follow its movements. It would be impossible, for instance, at one and the same time to accompany Raleigh and his sisters up Snowdon, and look on at Bramble catching crabs on the rocks at Broadstairs; nor, while we follow Dr Senior among the peaks and passes of Switzerland (and remark, by the way, what a nice quiet boy Tom Senior is, when he has only his father and his mother to tempt him into mischief) can we possibly expect to regard very attentively the doings of Simon, as he gapes about before the London shop-windows, and jerks off a score or more stanzas of his ""Hart's Earnings,"" which is now about a quarter done. So the reader must imagine how most of the boys spent their holidays, how they enjoyed them, and how they behaved themselves during the period, and be content to be told only about two groups of holiday-makers, about whom, as they are destined to figure pretty conspicuously in next term's doings at Saint Dominic's, it will be interesting to hear rather more particularly now. And the first group--if we can call a single person a ""group""--is Loman. Loman began his holidays in anything but cheerful spirits.  No one had seemed particularly sorry to say good-bye to him at Saint Dominic's, and a good many had been unmistakably glad.  And he had quite enough on his mind, apart from this, to make his home-coming far less joyous than it might have been.  It ought to have been the happiest event possible, for he was coming home to parents who loved him, friends who were glad to see him, and a home where every comfort and pleasure was within his reach.  Few boys, indeed, were more blessed than Loman with all the advantages of a Christian and happy home; and few boys could have failed to return to such a home after a long absence without delight.  But to Loman, these holidays, the surroundings of home afforded very little pleasure.  His mind was ill at ease.  The burden of debt was upon him, and the burden of suspense.  He had tried hard to assure himself that all would come right--that he would certainly win the scholarship, and so wipe off the debt; but his confidence became less and less comfortable as time went on. He dared not tell his troubles to his father, for he feared his upbraiding; and he would not confess them to his mother, for she, he knew, would tell all to his father.  He still clung to the hope that all would come right in the end; and then what would have been gained by telling his parents all about it? The one thing was hard work--and Loman came home determined to work. His parents saw him out of spirits, and were concerned.  They did what they could to cheer him, but without much success. ""Come, Edward, put away your books to-day,"" his mother would say; ""I want you to drive me over to Falkham in the pony-chaise."" ""I really can't, mother; I must work for the scholarship."" ""Nonsense, boy; what is a scholarship compared with your health? Besides, you'll work all the better if you take some exercise."" But for a week nothing could tempt him out.  Then, instead of accompanying his father or mother, he would take long solitary rides on his own pony, brooding all the while over his troubles. One day, when in the course of one of these expeditions he had taken the direction of Maltby--which was only fifteen miles distant from his home--he became suddenly aware of an approaching dog-cart in the road before him, and a familiar voice crying, ""Why, if it ain't young Squire Loman, riding a bit of very tidy horseflesh too, as I'm a Dutchman!"" It was Cripps.  What evil spirit could have brought him on the scene now? ""Well, I never reckoned to see you now,"" said he, in his usual jaunty manner.  ""Fact is, I was just trotting over to see _you_.  I wanted to try what this here cob was made of, and, thinks I, I may as well kill two birds with one stone, and look up my young squire while I'm about it."" ""Coming to see me!"" exclaimed Loman, horrified.  ""I say, Cripps, you mustn't do that.  My father would be very angry, you know."" ""Nice, that is!  As if I wasn't as good company as any one else!"" ""Oh! it's not that,"" said Loman, fearing he had given offence.  ""What I mean is--"" ""Oh, I know--about that there rod.  Bless me!  I won't let out on you, my beauty--leastways, if you come up to scratch.  He'd like to hear the story, though, the old gentleman, I fancy.  Wouldn't he now?"" ""I wouldn't have him know it for worlds.  It'll be all right, Cripps, indeed it will about the money."" Mr Cripps looked very benignant. ""All right, young swell, I hope it will.  Funny I feel such an interest in you, 'specially since that young greeny friend of yours put in a word for you.  He's a real nice sort, he is--he owes you one, and no mistake."" ""What!"" said Loman, in surprise; ""who do you mean?  Young Greenfield?"" ""To be sure.  Regular young chum of mine, he is.  I know all about you, my master, and no mistake!"" ""What--the young sneak?  What has he been saying about me?"" ""Eh!--what ain't he been saying!  In course you didn't half murder him, eh?  In course you ain't a good hand at cheatin' all round up at the school!  What?  In course you ain't saying nice things agin me all over the place--and in course some of us wouldn't like to see you get a reg'lar good hiding, wouldn't we?  Bless you, I knows all about it; but I'm mum, never fear!""  Loman was furious. ""The young liar!"" he exclaimed.  ""I did owe him one; I'll pay him when we get back!"" ""Hold hard, young gentleman,"" said Cripps, coolly.  ""To be sure, he ain't downright sweet on you; but I ain't a-going to have him smashed, mind, all to bits.  Well, never mind that.  I'll turn back with you, young gentleman, if I may.  We're only three miles from Maltby, and maybe you'll honour a poor chap like me by having a look in at the Cockchafer."" Loman did not know how to say ""No,"" much as he disliked and feared his host.  He returned with him to Maltby, and there spent an hour in the Cockchafer.  He was introduced to several of Mr Cripps's low friends, in whose society he found it easy enough to become low himself.  Cripps, by a judicious mixture of flattery and sly threats, managed to keep the boy well in hand, and when at last he rose to go it was with a promise to return again before the holidays were over--""to prevent Cripps having the trouble of calling on him,"" as that virtuous gentleman significantly put it. Loman kept his promise, and visited Maltby once or twice, becoming each time more familiar with Cripps and his low friends, who made a great deal of him, and flattered him on all possible occasions, so that the boy presently found himself, as he imagined, quite a young hero at the Cockchafer. Meanwhile, naturally, his reading fell behindhand.  His parents, only too glad to see their boy taking more regular exercise, never suspected or inquired as to the direction of his frequent solitary rides.  To them he seemed the same quiet, clever boy they fondly believed him.  Little guessed they of the troubles that filled his breast or the toils that were daily enwrapping him!

"Thus Loman's holidays came to an end.  The farewell was once more said, parents and son parted, and on the first day of an eventful term the boy found himself once more within the walls of Saint Dominic's. Oliver and Stephen, meanwhile, had been spending a very different sort of holiday at home.  There was high feast and revelry when the two boys returned once more to the maternal roof.  Stephen for once in a way had the satisfaction of finding himself a most unmistakable hero.  He never tired telling of his adventures and discoursing on the whole manner of his life since the day he left home for Saint Dominic's.  To his sister he recounted in all the slang phraseology he had at his command, the famous cricket matches in which he had borne a part; and she, though it was exactly like Greek to her, drank in every word with interest.  And to his mother he narrated his various fights with Bramble, and the terrific adventures through which he had passed, till the good lady's hair nearly stood on end, and she began to think a public school was a terrible place to send a small boy to. Oliver, of course, had his stories to tell too, only in a more sober manner. There was a great scene when, on the first day of the holidays, the elder brother produced his books and announced that he must study at least two hours a day in prospect of the Nightingale Scholarship examination.  But every one knew how much depended on his winning that scholarship, and in a few years being able to go to the university, so that the family gave in in the end, and Oliver was allowed his two hours' study, but not a second more, every day.  Stephen, meanwhile, taught his sister round-arm bowling, and devoted himself mind and body to the bicycle. The two brothers, during these holidays, became very great cronies.  At school Oliver had seen comparatively little of his young brother, but now they were daily and hourly thrown together, the brotherly instincts in each blossomed wonderfully, and a mutual attachment sprang up which had hardly been there before. It had been arranged, before breaking-up, that Oliver and Wraysford should spend the last week of the holiday together in rowing down the Thames from Oxford to London. Great was Stephen's joy and pride when one morning, near the appointed time, Oliver said to him, ""Look here, Stee.  How would you like to come with Wray and me next week?"" ""Like! wouldn't I rather!"" shouted the small boy in ecstasy.  ""Thanks, Noll, old man!  I say, it will be a spree.""  And the youngster became so riotous over the prospect that his elder brother had to threaten not to take him at all, and give him a thrashing into the bargain, before he could be reduced to order. They were to take a tent with them, and cooking utensils, so as to be quite independent of inns, and each voyager was to contribute his share of provender.  Quite a Robinson Crusoe business, even down to the desert island, for on desert islands the boys had declared they intended every night to take up their quarters, and, come hail, snow, or lightning, there to sleep under their waterproof tent. Mrs Greenfield didn't half like the idea, and became very pathetic on the subject of ague and rheumatic fever.  But the boys carried the day by promising faithfully that they would catch neither malady.  The looked-for day came at last, and to Oxford they went, where the familiar sight of Wraysford, in boating costume, at the railway station still further elated their high spirits.  The boat was ready.  The tent, the provender, the blankets, were snugly stowed away on board.  The weather was fine, the river was charming, everything promised well; and punctually that Monday afternoon the three adventurers loosed from their moorings and turned the nose of their boat towards London. I wish I could tell the reader all the events of that wonderful voyage: how they paddled down merrily with the stream; how they found their desert island covered with nettles, which they had to mow down with their oars; how the soup-kettle wouldn't act, and the stew-pan leaked; how grand the potted lobster tasted; how Stephen offered to make tea with muddy water, and how the paraffin oil of their lanterns leaked all over their plum-cake and sandwiches; how Stephen was sent up inland to forage, and came back with wonderful purchases of eggs and milk; how they started off one day leaving their tent behind them, and had to row back in a panic to recover it; how it rained one night, and a puddle formed on the roof of the tent, which presently grew so big that it overflowed and gave Wraysford a shower-bath; how each morning they all took headers into the stream, much to the alarm of the sleepy ducks; how they now and then ran foul of a boat, and now and then were turned off their camping ground by an indignant keeper!  It was glorious fun.  But it would take a volume to recount all that happened to them. They were coming near the end of their cruise.  They had paddled down past the magnificent woods of Cliveden, and under the pretty bridge of Maidenhead; they had watched the boys bathing at ""Athens,"" and they had rowed through the gloomy shadow of Windsor Castle and on past Eton. Here the river is broken by a string of islands, which in many parts make the stream narrow; and the river being full of boats and barges, our three adventurers found themselves called upon to exercise more than ordinary precautions in keeping their course.  This responsibility became at last so irksome that Oliver said, ""I say, can't we get out of this rabble anyhow?  Why shouldn't we take the other side of the islands?"" ""I don't know.  It would be a good deal quieter.  I wonder none of the boats do it."" ""Let's try, anyhow.  We can't be far from the lock, and then the river will be wider.  Take us up inside the next island, Stee, and mind you don't foul any one while you're about it."" Stephen did as he was bid.  The stream was pretty strong just there, and the two rowers had to pull pretty hard to get round without drifting on to the island. Once out of the main stream, they were delighted to find the course clear.  Indeed, they had the channel all to themselves. ""What a jolly pace the stream is going at!"" said Stephen; ""why don't you drift, you fellows, instead of pulling like that?"" ""Good idea for you, young 'un,"" said Wraysford, pulling in his oar. Oliver followed his example.
