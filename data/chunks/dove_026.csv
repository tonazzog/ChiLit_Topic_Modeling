"CHAPTER XXV. THE STAR AND THE SPARK  THE year 1531 has begun, and Schloss Adlerstein remains in its strength on the mountain side, but with a look of cultivation on its environs such as would have amazed Kunigunde.  Vines run up trellises against the rocks; pot-herbs and flowers nestle in the nooks; outbuildings cluster round it; and even the grim old keep has a range of buildings connected with it, as if the household had entirely outgrown the capacities of the square tower. Yet the old hall is still the chief place of assembly, and now that it has been wainscoted, with a screen of carved wood to shut off the draughty passages, and a stove of bright tiles to increase the warmth, it is far more cheerful.  Moreover, a window has been opened showing the rich green meadow below, with the bridge over the Braunwasser, and the little church, with a spire of pierced lace-work, and white cottages peeping out of the retreating forest. That is the window which the Lady Baroness loves.  See her there, the lovely old lady of seventy-five—yes, lovelier than ever, for her sweet brown eyes have the same pensive, clear beauty, enhanced by the snowy whiteness of her hair, of which a soft braid shows over the pure pale brow beneath the white band, and sweeping black veil, that she has worn by right for twenty years.  But the slight form is active and brisk, and there are ready smiles and looks of interest for the pretty fair-haired maidens, three in number, who run in and out from their household avocations to appeal to the “dear grandmother,” mischievously to tell of the direful yawns proceeding from brothers Ebbo and Gottfried over their studies with their tutor, or to gaze from the window and wonder if the father, with the two brothers, Friedel Max and Kasimir, will return from Ulm in time for the “mid-day eating.” Ah! there they are.  Quick-eyed Vittoria has seen the cavalcade first, and dances off to tell Ermentrude and Stine time enough to prepare their last batch of fritters for the new-comers; Ebbo and Götz rush headlong down the hillside; and the Lady Baroness lays down her distaff, and gazes with eyes of satisfied content at the small party of horsemen climbing up the footpath.  Then, when they have wound out of sight round a rock, she moves out towards the hall-door, with a light, quick step, for never yet has she resigned her great enjoyment, that of greeting her son on the steps of the porch—those steps where she once met such fearful news, but where that memory has been effaced by many a cheerful welcome. There, then, she stands, amid the bright throng of grandchildren, while the Baron and his sons spring from their horses and come up to her.  The Baron doffs his Spanish hat, bends the knee, kisses her hand, and receives her kiss on his brow, with the fervour of a life-devotion, before he turns to accept the salutation of his daughters, and then takes her hand, with pretty affectionate ceremony, to hand her back to her seat.  A few words pass between them.  “No, motherling,” he says, “I signed it not; I will tell you all by and by.” And then the mid-day meal is served for the whole household, as of old, with the salt-cellar in the middle, but with a far larger company above it than when first we saw it.  The seven young folks preserve a decorous silence, save when Fraulein Ermentrude’s cookeries are good-naturedly complimented by her father, or when Baron Friedmund Maximilianus breaks out with some wonderful fact about new armour seen at Ulm.  He is a handsome, fair, flaxen-haired young man—like the old Adlersteins, say the elder people—and full of honest gaiety and good nature, the special pride of his sisters; and no sooner is the meal over, than, with a formal entreaty for dismissal, all the seven, and all the dogs, move off together, to that favourite gathering-place round the stove, where all their merry tongues are let loose together. To them, the Herr Vater and the Frau Grossmutter seem nearly of the same age, and of the same generation; and verily the eighteen years between the mother and son have dwindled into a very small difference even in appearance, and a lesser one in feeling.  She is a youthful, beautiful old lady; he a grave, spare, worn, elderly man, in his full strength, but with many a trace of care and thought, and far more of silver than of brown in his thin hair and pointed beard, and with a melancholy thoughtfulness in his clear brown eyes—all well corresponding with the gravity of the dress in which he has been meeting the burghers of Ulm; a black velvet suit—only relieved by his small white lace ruff, and the ribbon and jewel of the Golden Fleece, the only other approach to ornament that he wears being that ring long ago twisted off the Emperor Maximilian’s chain.  But now, as he has bowed off the chaplain to his study, and excused himself from aiding his two gentlemen-squires in consuming their krug of beer, and hands his mother to her favourite nook in the sunny window, taking his seat by her side, his features assume an expression of repose and relaxation as if here indeed were his true home. He has chosen his seat in full view of a picture that hangs on the wainscoted wall, near his mother—a picture whose pure ethereal tinting, of colour limpid as the rainbow, yet rich as the most glowing flower-beds; and its soft lovely _pose_, and rounded outlines, prove it to be no produce even of one of the great German artists of the time, but to have been wrought, under an Italian sky, by such a hand as left us the marvellous smile of Mona Lisa.  It represents two figures, one unmistakably himself when in the prime of life, his brow and cheeks unfurrowed, and his hair still thick, shining brown, but with the same grave earnestness of the dark eye that came with the early sense of responsibility, and with the first sorrow of his youth.  The other figure, one on which the painter evidently loved to dwell, is of a lady, so young that she might almost pass for his daughter, except for the peculiar, tender sweetness that could only become the wife and mother. Fair she is as snow, with scarce a deepening of the rose on cheek, or even lip, fragile and transparent as a spiritual form, and with a light in the blue eyes, and a grace in the soft fugitive smile, that scarce seems to belong to earth; a beauty not exactly of feature, but rather the pathetic loveliness of calm fading away—as if she were already melting into the clear blue sky with the horizon of golden light, that the wondrous power of art has made to harmonize with, but not efface, her blue dress, golden hair, white coif, and fair skin.  It is as if she belonged to that sky, and only tarried as unable to detach herself from the clasp of the strong hand round and in which both her hands are twined; and though the light in her face may be from heaven, yet the whole countenance is fixed in one absorbed, almost worshipping gaze of her husband, with a wistful simplicity and innocence on devotion, like the absorption of a loving animal, to whom its master’s presence is bliss and sunshine.  It is a picture to make light in a dark place, and that sweet face receives a loving glance, nay, an absolutely reverent bend of the knightly head, as the Baron seats himself.

"“So it was as we feared, and this Schmalkaldic League did not suit thy sense of loyalty, my son?” she asks, reading his features anxiously. “No, mother.  I ever feared that further pressure would drive our friends beyond the line where begin schism and rebellion; and it seems to me that the moment is come when I must hold me still, or transgress mine own sense of duty.  I must endure the displeasure of many I love and respect.” “Surely, my son, they have known you too long and too well not to respect your motives, and know that conscience is first with you.” “Scarce may such confidence be looked for, mother, from the most part, who esteem every man a traitor to the cause if he defend it not precisely in the fashion of their own party.  But I hear that the King of France has offered himself as an ally, and that Dr. Luther, together with others of our best divines, have thereby been startled into doubts of the lawfulness of the League.” “And what think you of doing, my son?” “I shall endeavour to wait until such time as the much-needed General Council may proclaim the ancient truth, and enable us to avouch it without disunion.  Into schism I _will_ not be drawn.  I have held truth all my life in the Church, nor will I part from her now.  If intrigues again should prevail, then, Heaven help us!  Meantime, mother, the best we can, as has ever been your war-cry.” “And much has been won for us.  Here are the little maidens, who, save Vittoria, would never have been scholars, reading the Holy Word daily in their own tongue.” “Ach, I had not told you, mother!  I have the Court Secretary’s answer this day about that command in the Kaisar’s guards that my dear old master had promised to his godson.” “Another put-off with Flemish courtesy, I see by thy face, Ebbo.” “Not quite that, mother.  The command is ready for the Baron Friedmund Maximilianus von Adlerstein Wildschloss, and all the rest of it, on the understanding that he has been bred up free from all taint of the new doctrine.” “New?  Nay, it is the oldest of all doctrine.” “Even so.  As I ever said, Dr. Luther hath been setting forth in greater clearness and fulness what our blessed Friedel and I learnt at your knee, and my young ones have learnt from babyhood of the true Catholic doctrine.  Yet I may not call my son’s faith such as the Kaisar’s Spanish conscience-keepers would have it, and so the boy must e’en tarry at home till there be work for his stout arm to do.” “He seems little disappointed.  His laugh comes ringing the loudest of all.” “The Junker is more of a boy at two-and-twenty than I ever recollect myself!  He lacks not sense nor wit, but a fray or a feast, a chase or a dance, seem to suffice him at an age when I had long been dwelling on matters of moment.” “Thou wast left to be thine own pilot; he is but one of thy gay crew, and thus even these stirring times touch him not so deeply as thou wert affected by thine own choice in life between disorderly freedom and honourable restraint.” “I thought of that choice to-day, mother, as I crossed the bridge and looked at the church; and more than ever thankful did I feel that our blessed Friedel, having aided me over that one decisive pass, was laid to rest, his tender spirit unvexed by the shocks and divisions that have wrenched me hither and thither.” “Nay; not hither and thither.  Ever hadst thou a resolute purpose and aim.” “Ever failed in by my own error or that of others—What, thou nestling here, my little Vittoria, away from all yonder prattle?” “Dear father, if I may, I love far best to hear you and the grandmother talk.” “Hear the child!  She alone hath your face, mother, or Friedel’s eyes! Is it that thou wouldst be like thy noble Roman godmother, the Marchesa di Pescara, that makes thee seek our grave company, little one?” “I always long to hear you talk of her, and of the Italian days, dear father, and how you won this noble jewel of yours.” “Ah, child, that was before those times!  It was the gift of good Kaisar Max at his godson’s christening, when he filled your sweet mother with pretty spite by persuading her that it was a little golden bear-skin.” “Tell her how you had gained it, my son.” “By vapouring, child; and by the dull pride of my neighbours.  Heard’st thou never of the siege of Padua, when we had Bayard, the best knight in Europe, and 500 Frenchmen for our allies?  Our artillery had made a breach, and the Kaisar requested the French knights to lead the storm, whereto they answered, Well and good, but our German nobles must share the assault, and not leave them to fight with no better backers than the hired lanzknechts.  All in reason, quoth I, and more shame for us not to have been foremost in our Kaisar’s own cause; but what said the rest of our misproud chivalry?  They would never condescend to climb a wall on foot in company with lanzknechts!  On horseback must their worships fight, or not at all; and when to shame them I called myself a mountaineer, more used to climb than to ride, and vowed that I should esteem it an honour to follow such a knight as Bayard, were it on all fours, then cast they my burgher blood in my teeth.  Never saw I the Kaisar so enraged; he swore that all the common sense in the empire was in the burgher blood, and that he would make me a knight of the noblest order in Europe to show how he esteemed it.  And next morning he was gone!  So ashamed was he of his own army that he rode off in the night, and sent orders to break up the siege.  I could have torn my hair, for I had just lashed up a few of our nobles to a better sense of honour, and we would yet have redeemed our name!  And after all, the Chapter of proud Flemings would never have admitted me had not the heralds hunted up that the Sorels were gentlemen of blood and coat armour long ago at Liège.  I am glad my father lived to see that proved, mother.  He could not honour thee more than he did, but he would have been sorely grieved had I been rejected.  He often thought me a mechanical burgher, as it was.” “Not quite so, my son.  He never failed to be proud of thy deeds, even when he did not understand them; but this, and the grandson’s birth, were the crowning joys of his life.” “Yes, those were glad triumphant years, take them all in all, ere the Emperor sent me to act ambassador in Rome, and we left you the two elder little girls and the boy to take care of.  My dear little Thekla!  She had a foreboding that she might never see those children more, yet would she have pined her heart away more surely had I left her at home!  I never was absent a week but I found her wasted with watching for me.” ",fear suit sense loyalty son ask read feature mother fear further pressure drive friend line begin schism rebellion seem moment hold transgress own sense duty endure displeasure many love respect son respect motive conscience first scarce such confidence mother most part esteem man traitor cause defend fashion own party hear offer ally other divine startle doubt lawfulness son endeavour wait such time need proclaim ancient truth enable avouch disunion schism draw hold truth life part intrigue prevail heaven help mother war cry win maiden save scholar read holy own tongue mother answer day command guard dear old master promise godson put flemish courtesy face mother command ready rest understanding breed free taint new doctrine new old doctrine set great clearness fulness bless learn knee young one learn babyhood true catholic doctrine call son faith such spanish conscience keeper boy tarry home work stout arm seem disappointed laugh ring loudest more boy recollect lack sense wit fray feast chase dance seem suffice age dwelling matter moment leave own pilot gay crew stir time touch affect own choice life disorderly freedom honourable restraint choice day mother cross bridge church more thankful feel bless aid decisive pass lay rest tender spirit unvex shock division wrench resolute purpose aim fail own error other nestle yonder prattle dear father love hear grandmother talk hear child face mother eye noble roman godmother seek grave company one hear talk italian day dear father win noble jewel child time gift godson christening fill sweet mother pretty spite persuade golden bear skin gain son vapour child dull pride neighbour siege knight ally artillery breach request french knight lead storm answer german noble share assault leave fight backer hire lanzknecht reason quoth more shame foremost own cause rest misproud chivalry condescend climb wall foot company lanzknecht horseback worship fight shame call mountaineer use climb ride vow esteem honour follow knight four cast burgher blood tooth enrage swore common sense empire burgher blood knight noblest order show esteem next morning gone ashamed own army ride night send order break siege tear hair lash few noble sense honour redeem name proud admit herald hunt gentleman blood coat armour glad father live prove mother honour more grieve reject mechanical burgher son fail proud deed understand grandson birth crown joy life glad triumphant year emperor send act ambassador leave elder girl boy care dear foreboding child pine heart leave home absent week find waste watch 
"“It was those weary seven years of Italy that changed thee most, my son.” “Apart from you, mother, and knowing you now indeed to be widowed, and with on the one hand such contradictory commands from the Emperor as made me sorely ashamed of myself, of my nation, and of the man whom I loved and esteemed personally the most on earth, yet bound there by his express command, while I saw my tender wife’s health wasting in the climate day by day!  Yet still, while most she gasped for a breath of Swabian hills, she ever declared it would kill her outright to send her from me.  And thus it went on till I laid her in the stately church of her own patroness.  Then how it would have fared with me and the helpless little ones I know not, but for thy noble godmother, my Vittoria, the wise and ready helper of all in trouble, the only friend thy mother had made at Rome, and who had been able, from all her heights of learning and accomplishment, to value my Thekla’s golden soul in its simplicity.  Even then, when too late, came one of the Kaisar’s kindest letters, recalling me,—a letter whose every word I would have paid for with a drop of my own blood six weeks before! and which he had only failed to send because his head was running on the plan of that gorgeous tomb where he is not buried!  Well, at least it brought us home to you again once more, mother, and, where you are, comfort never has been utterly absent from me.  And then, coming from the wilful gloom of Pope Leo’s court into our Germany, streamed over by the rays of Luther’s light, it was as if a new world of hope were dawning, as if truth would no longer be muffled, and the young would grow up to a world far better and purer than the old had ever seen.  What trumpet-calls those were, and how welcome was the voice of the true Catholic faith no longer stifled!  And my dear old Kaisar, with his clear eyes, his unfettered mind—he felt the power and truth of those theses.  He bade the Elector of Saxony well to guard the monk Luther as a treasure.  Ah! had he been a younger man, or had he been more firm and resolute, able to act as well as think for himself, things might have gone otherwise with the Church.  He could think, but could not act; and now we have a man who acts, but _will_ not think.  It may have been a good day for our German reputation among foreign princes when Charles V. put on the crown; but only two days in my life have been as mournful to me as that when I stood by Kaisar Max’s death-bed at Wells, and knew that generous, loving, fitful spirit was passing away from the earth!  Never owned I friend I loved so well as Kaisar Max!  Nor has any Emperor done so much for this our dear land.” “The young Emperor never loved thee.” “He might have treated me as one who could be useful, but he never forgave me for shaking hands with Luther at the Diet of Worms.  I knew it was all over with my court favour after I had joined in escorting the Doctor out of the city.  And the next thing was that Georg of Freundsberg and his friends proclaimed me a bigoted Papist because I did my utmost to keep my troop out of the devil’s holiday at the sack of Rome!  It has ever been my lot to be in disgrace with one side or the other!  Here is my daughter’s marriage hindered on the one hand, my son’s promotion checked on the other, because I have a conscience of my own, and not of other people’s!  Heaven knows the right is no easy matter to find; but, when one thinks one sees it, there is nothing to be done but to guide oneself by it, even if the rest of the world will not view it in the same light.” “Nothing else!  I doubt me whether it be ever easy to see the veritably right course while still struggling in the midst.  That is for after ages, which behold things afar off; but each man must needs follow his own principle in an honest and good heart, and assuredly God will guide him to work out some good end, or hinder some evil one.” “Ay, mother.  Each party may guard one side or other of the truth in all honesty and faithfulness; he who cannot with his whole heart cast in his lot with either,—he is apt to serve no purpose, and to be scorned.” “Nay, Ebbo, may he not be a witness to the higher and more perfect truth than either party have conceived?  Nor is inaction always needful.  That which is right towards either side still reveals itself at the due moment, whether it be to act or to hold still.  And verily, Ebbo, what thou didst say even now has set me on a strange thought of mine own dream, that which heralded the birth of thyself and thy brother.  As thou knowest, it seemed to me that I was watching two sparkles from the extinguished Needfire wheel.  One rose aloft and shone as a star!” “My guiding-star!” “The other fulfilled those words of the Wise Man.  It shone and ran to and fro in the grass.  And surely, my Ebbo, thy mother may feel that, in all these dark days of perplexity and trial, the spark of light hath ever shone and drawn its trail of brightness in the gloom, even though the way was long, and seemed uncertain.” “The mother who ever fondled me _will_ think so, it may be!  But, ah! she had better pray that the light be clearer, and that I may not fall utterly short of the star!” Travellers in Wurtemburg may perhaps turn aside from glorious old Ulm, and the memories of the battlefields around it, to the romantic country round the Swabian mountains, through which descend the tributaries of the Danube.  Here they may think themselves fortunate if they come upon a green valley, with a bright mountain torrent dashing through it, fresh from the lofty mountain, with terraced sides that rise sheer above.  An old bridge, a mill, and a neat German village lie clustered in the valley; a seignorial mansion peeps out of the forest glades; and a lovely church, of rather late Gothic, but beautifully designed, attracts the eye so soon as it can be persuaded to quit the romantic outline of the ruined baronial castle high up on one of the mountain ledges.  Report declares that there are tombs in the church well worth inspection.  You seek out an old venerable blue-coated peasant who has charge of the church. “What is yonder castle?” “It is the castle of Adlerstein.” “Are the family still extant?” “Yea, yea; they built yonder house when the Schloss became ruinous.  They have always been here.” The church is very beautiful in its details, the carved work of the east end and pulpit especially so, but nothing is so attractive as the altar tomb in the chantry chapel.  It is a double one, holding not, as usual, the recumbent effigies of a husband and wife, but of two knights in armour.
