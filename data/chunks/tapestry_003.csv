"CHAPTER III. ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT.           ""O moon! in the night I have seen you sailing,            And shining so round and low.""                                      CHILD NATURE.  ""And what did you dream, Chéri?"" inquired Jeanne the next morning in a confidential and mysterious tone. Hugh hesitated. ""I don't know,"" he said at last. ""At least----"" he stopped and hesitated again. The two children were having their ""little breakfast,"" consisting of two great big cups of nice hot milky coffee and two big slices of bread, with the sweet fresh butter for which the country where Jeanne's home was is famed. They were alone in Jeanne's room, and Marcelline had drawn a little table close to the fire for them, for this morning it seemed colder than ever; fresh snow had fallen during the night, and out in the garden nothing was to be seen but smoothly-rounded white mounds of varying sizes and heights, and up in the sky the dull blue-grey curtain of snow-cloud made one draw back shivering from the window, feeling as if the sun had gone off in a sulky fit and would _never_ come back again. But inside, close by the brightly-blazing wood fire, Jeanne and Hugh found themselves ""very well,"" as the little girl called it, very well indeed. And the hot coffee was very nice, much nicer, Hugh thought, than the very weak tea which his grandmother's maid used to give him for breakfast at home. He stirred it round and round slowly with his spoon, staring into his cup, while he repeated, in answer to little Jeanne's question about what he had dreamt, ""No, I don't know."" ""But you did dream _something_,"" said Jeanne rather impatiently. ""Can't you tell me about it? I thought you were going to have all sorts of funny things to tell me. You said you would have a party of the peacocks and all the pets, and make them tell stories."" ""Yes,"" said Hugh slowly. ""But I couldn't make them--I must wait till they come. I think I did dream some funny things last night, but I can't remember. There seemed to be a lot of chattering, and once I thought I saw the raven standing at the end of the bed, but that time I wasn't dreaming. I'm sure I wasn't; but I was very sleepy, and I couldn't hear what he said. He seemed to want me to do something or other, and then he nodded his head to where the peacocks are, and do you know, Jeanne, I thought they nodded too. Wasn't that funny? But I daresay it was only the firelight--the fire had burnt low, and then it bobbed up again all of a sudden."" ""And what more?"" asked Jeanne eagerly. ""O Chéri, I think that's wonderful! Do tell me some more."" ""I don't think I remember any more,"" said Hugh. ""After that I went to sleep, and then it was all a muddle. There were the chickens and Nibble and the tortoise all running about, and Dudu seemed to be talking to me all the time. But it was just a muddle; you know how dreams go sometimes. And when I woke up the fire was quite out and it was all dark. And then I saw the light of Marcelline's candle through the hinge of the door, and she came to tell me it was time to get up."" ""Oh dear,"" said Jeanne, ""I do hope you'll dream some more to-night."" ""I daresay I shan't dream at all,"" said Hugh. ""Some nights I go to sleep, and it's morning in one minute. I don't like that much, because it's nice to wake up and feel how cosy it is in bed."" ""But, Chéri,"" pursued Jeanne after a few moments' silence, and a few more bites at her bread and butter, ""there's one thing I don't understand. It's about Dudu. You said it wasn't a dream, you were sure. Do you think he was really there, at the foot of the bed? It might have been the firelight that made you think you saw the peacocks nodding, but it couldn't have been the firelight that made you think you saw Dudu."" ""No,"" said Hugh, ""I can't understand it either. If it was a dream it was a very queer one, for I never felt more awake in my life. I'll tell you what, Jeanne, the next time I think I see Dudu like that I'll run and tell you."" ""Yes, do,"" said Jeanne, ""though I don't know that it would be much good. Dudu's dreadfully tricky."" She had not told Hugh of the trick the raven had played her, though why she had not done so she could hardly have explained. Perhaps she was a little ashamed of having been so frightened; perhaps she was still a little afraid of Dudu; and most of all, I think, she had a great curiosity to find out more about the mysterious bird, and thought it best to leave Hugh to face his own adventures. ""If Dudu thinks I've told Chéri all about his funny ways,"" she thought, ""perhaps he'll be angry and not do any more queer things."" The snow was still, as I said, thick on the ground, thicker, indeed, than the day before. But the children managed to amuse themselves very well. Marcelline would not hear of their going out, not even as far as the chickens' house, but she fetched Nibble to pay them a visit in the afternoon, and they had great fun with him. ""He looks very happy, doesn't he, Chéri?"" said Jeanne. ""I am sure Houpet has been kind to him. What a pity pets can't speak, isn't it? they could tell us such nice funny things."" ""Yes,"" said Hugh, ""I've often thought that, and I often have thought Nibble could speak if he liked."" ""_Houpet_ could, I'm quite sure,"" said Jeanne, ""and I believe Dudu and he do speak to each other. You should just see them sometimes. Why, there they are!"" she added, going close up to the window near which she had been standing. ""Do come here, Chéri, quick, but come very quietly."" Hugh came forward and looked out. There were the four birds, making the quaintest group you could fancy. Houpet with his waving tuft of feathers was perched on the top rung of a short garden ladder, his two little hens as usual close beside him. And down below on the path stood the raven, on one leg of course, his queer black head very much on one side, as he surveyed the little group above him. ""Silly young people,"" he seemed to be saying to himself; but Houpet was not to be put down so. With a shrill, clear crow he descended from his perch, stepped close up to Dudu, looked him in the face, and then quietly marched off, followed by his two companions. The children watched this little scene with the greatest interest. ""They _do_ look as if they were talking to each other,"" said Hugh. ""I wonder what it's about."" ""Perhaps it's about the party,"" said Jeanne; ""the party you said you'd give to the peacocks on the wall, and all the pets."" ""Perhaps,"" said Hugh. ""I am sure there must be beautiful big rooms in that castle with the lots of steps up to it, where the peacocks stand. Don't you think it would be nice to get inside that castle and see what it's like?"" ""Oh, wouldn't it!"" said Jeanne, clapping her hands. ""How I do wish we could! You might tell Dudu to take us, Chéri. Perhaps it's a fairy palace really, though it only looks like a picture, and if Dudu's a fairy, he might know about it."" ""I'll ask him if I get a chance,"" said Hugh. ""Good morning, Monsieur Dudu,"" he went on, bowing politely from the window to the raven, who had cocked his head in another direction, and seemed now to be looking up at the two children with the same supercilious stare he had bestowed upon the cock and hens. ""Good morning, Monsieur Dudu; I hope you won't catch cold with this snowy weather. It's best to be very polite to him, you see,"" added Hugh, turning to Jeanne; ""for if he took offence we should get no fun out of him."" ""Oh yes,"" said Jeanne, ""it is much best to be very polite to him. Look at him now, Chéri; _doesn't_ he look as if he knew what we were saying?"" For Dudu was eyeing them unmistakably by this time, his head more on one side than ever, and his lame leg stuck out in the air like a walking-stick. ""That's _just_ how he stood at the foot of the bed, on the wood part, you know,"" said Hugh, in a whisper. ""And weren't you frightened, Chéri?"" said Jeanne. ""I always think Dudu looks not at all like a good fairy, when he cocks his head on one side and sticks his claw out like that. I quite believe then that he's a wicked enchanter. O Chéri,"" she went on, catching hold of Hugh, ""what _should_ we do if he was to turn us into two little frogs or toads?""

"""We should have to live in the water, and eat nasty little worms and flies, I suppose,"" said Hugh gravely. ""And that sort of thick green stuff that grows at the top of dirty ponds; fancy having that for soup,"" said Jeanne pathetically. ""O Chéri, we must indeed be very polite to Dudu, and take _great_ pains not to offend him; and if he comes to you in the night, you must be sure to call me at once."" But the following night and several nights after that went by, and nothing was heard or seen of Monsieur Dudu. The weather got a little milder; that is to say, the snow gradually melted away, and the children were allowed to go out into the garden and visit their pets. Nibble seemed quite at home in his new quarters, and was now permitted to run about the chicken-house at his own sweet will; and Jeanne greatly commended Houpet for his kindness to the little stranger, which commendation the chicken received in very good part, particularly when it took the shape of all the tit-bits left on the children's plates. ""See how tame he is,"" said Jeanne one day when she had persuaded the little cock to peck some crumbs out of her hand; ""isn't he a darling, Chéri, with his _dear_ little tuft of feathers on the top of his head?"" ""He's awfully funny-looking,"" said Hugh, consideringly; ""do you really think he's very pretty, Jeanne?"" ""Of course I do,"" said Jeanne, indignantly; ""all my pets are pretty, but Houpet's the prettiest of all."" ""He's prettier than Grignan, certainly,"" said Hugh, giving an amiable little push to the tortoise, who happened to be lying at his feet; ""but I like Grignan, he's so comical."" ""I think Grignan must know a great deal,"" said Jeanne, ""he's so solemn."" ""So is Dudu,"" said Hugh. ""By the by, Jeanne,"" he went on, but stopped suddenly. ""What?"" said Jeanne. ""It just came into my head while we were talking that I must have dreamt of Dudu again last night; but now I try to remember it, it has all gone out of my head."" ""_What_ a pity,"" said Jeanne; ""do try to remember. Was it that he came and stood at the foot of the bed again, like the last time? You promised to call me if he did."" ""No, I don't think he did. I have more a sort of feeling that he and the peacocks on the wall were whispering to each other--something about us--you and me, Jeanne--it was, I think."" ""Perhaps they were going to give a party, and were planning about inviting us,"" suggested Jeanne. ""I don't know,"" said Hugh; ""it's no good my trying to think. It's just a sleepy feeling of having heard something. I can't remember anything else, and the more I think, the less I remember."" ""Well, you must be sure to tell me if you do hear anything more. I was awake ever so long in the night, ever so long; but I didn't mind, there was such nice moonlight."" ""Moonlight, was there?"" said Hugh; ""I didn't know that. I'll try to keep awake to-night, because Marcelline says the figures on the walls are so pretty when it's moonlight."" ""And if Dudu comes, or you see anything funny, you'll promise to call me?"" said Jeanne. Hugh nodded his head. There was not much fear of his forgetting his promise. Jeanne reminded him of it at intervals all that day, and when the children kissed each other for good-night she whispered again, ""Remember to call me, Chéri."" Chéri went to sleep with the best possible intentions as to ""remembering."" He had, first of all, intended not to go to sleep at all, for his last glance out of the window before going to bed showed him Monsieur Dudu on the terrace path, enjoying the moonlight apparently, but, Hugh strongly suspected, bent on mischief, for his head was very much on one side and his claw very much stuck out, in the way which Jeanne declared made him look like a very impish raven indeed. ""I wonder what Marcelline meant about the moonlight,"" thought Hugh to himself as he lay down. ""I hardly see the figures on the wall at all. The moon must be going behind a cloud. I wonder if it will be brighter in the middle of the night. I don't see that I need stay awake all the night to see. I can easily wake again. I'll just take a little sleep first."" And the little sleep turned out such a long one, that when poor Hugh opened his eyes, lo and behold! it was to-morrow morning--there was Marcelline standing beside the bed, telling him it was time to get up, he would be late for his tutor if he did not dress himself at once. ""Oh dear,"" exclaimed Hugh, ""what a pity! I meant to stay awake all night to watch the moonlight."" Marcelline smiled what Jeanne called her funny smile. ""You would find it very difficult to do that, I think, my little Monsieur,"" she said. ""However, you did not miss much last night. The clouds came over so that the moon had no chance. Perhaps it will be clearer to-night."" With this hope Hugh had to be satisfied, and to satisfy also his little cousin, who was at first quite disappointed that he had nothing wonderful to tell her. ""To-night,"" she said, ""_I_ shall stay awake all night, and if the moonlight is very nice and bright I shall come and wake _you_, you sleepy Chéri. I do _so_ want to go up those steps and into the castle where the peacocks are standing at the door."" ""So do I,"" said Hugh, rather mortified; ""but if one goes to sleep, whose fault is it? I am sure you will go to sleep too, if you try to keep awake. There's _nothing_ makes people go to sleep so fast as trying to keep awake."" ""Well, don't try then,"" said Jeanne, ""and see what comes then."" And when night came, Hugh, partly perhaps because he was particularly sleepy--the day had been so much finer that the children had had some splendid runs up and down the long terrace walk in the garden, and the unusual exercise had made both of them very ready for bed when the time came--took Jeanne's advice, tucked himself up snugly and went off to sleep without thinking of the moonlight, or the peacocks, or Dudu, or anything. He slept so soundly, that when he awoke he thought it was morning, and brighter morning than had hitherto greeted him since he came to Jeanne's home. ""Dear me!"" he said to himself, rubbing his eyes, ""it must be very late; it looks just as if summer had come,"" for the whole room was flooded with light--such beautiful light--bright and clear, and yet soft. No wonder that Hugh rubbed his eyes in bewilderment--it was not till he sat up in bed and looked well about him, quite awake now, that he saw that after all it was moonlight, not sunshine, which was illumining the old tapestry room and everything which it contained in this wonderful way. ""Oh, how pretty it is!"" thought Hugh. ""No wonder Marcelline told us that we should see the tapestry in the moonlight. I never could have thought it would have looked so pretty. Why, even the peacocks' tails seem to have got all sorts of new colours."" He leant forward to examine them better. They were standing--just as usual--one on each side of the flight of steps leading up to the castle. But as Hugh gazed at them it certainly seemed to him--could it be his fancy only?--no, it _must_ be true--that their long tails grew longer and swept the ground more majestically--then that suddenly--fluff! a sort of little wind seemed to rustle for an instant, and fluff! again, the two peacocks had spread their tails, and now stood with them proudly reared fan-like, at their backs, just like the real living birds that Hugh had often admired in his grandfather's garden. Hugh was too much amazed to rub his eyes again--he could do nothing but stare, and stare he did with all his might, but for a moment or two there was nothing else to be seen. The peacocks stood still--so still that Hugh now began to doubt whether they had not always stood, tails spread, just as he saw them now, and whether these same tails having ever drooped on the ground was not altogether his fancy. A good deal puzzled, and a little disappointed, he was turning away to look at another part of the pictured walls, when again a slight flutter of movement caught his eyes.
