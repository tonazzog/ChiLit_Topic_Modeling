"     Like Alexander, I will reign,      And I will reign alone,      My thoughts shall ever more disdain      A rival near my throne.      But I must rule and govern still,      And always give the law,      And have each subject at my will,      And all to stand in awe.                          --MONTROSE.  One very hot afternoon, shortly after the ball, Captain Morville walked to Hollywell, accelerating his pace under the influence of anxious reflections. He could not determine whether Charles had spoken in jest; but in spite of Guy’s extreme youth, he feared there was ground for the suspicion excited by the hint, and was persuaded that such an attachment could produce nothing but unhappiness to his cousin, considering how little confidence could be placed in Guy. He perceived that there was much to inspire affection--attractive qualities, amiable disposition, the talent for music, and now this recently discovered power of versifying, all were in Guy’s favour, besides the ancient name and long ancestry, which conferred a romantic interest, and caused even Philip to look up to him with a feudal feeling as head of the family. There was also the familiar intercourse to increase the danger; and Philip, as he reflected on these things, trembled for Laura, and felt himself her only protector; for his uncle was nobody, Mrs. Edmonstone was infatuated, and Charles would not listen to reason. To make everything worse, he had that morning heard that there was to be a grand inspection of the regiment, and a presentation of colours; Colonel Deane was very anxious; and it was plain that in the interval the officers would be allowed little leisure. The whole affair was to end with a ball, which would lead to a repetition of what had already disturbed him. Thus meditating, Philip, heated and dusty, walked into the smooth green enclosure of Hollywell. Everything, save the dancing clouds of insect youth which whirled in his face, was drooping in the heat. The house--every door and window opened--seemed gasping for breath; the cows sought refuge in the shade; the pony drooped its head drowsily; the leaves hung wearily; the flowers were faint and thirsty; and Bustle was stretched on the stone steps, mouth open, tongue out, only his tail now and then moving, till he put back his ears and crested his head to greet the arrival. Philip heard the sounds that had caused the motion of the sympathizing tail--the rich tones of Guy’s voice. Stepping over the dog, he entered, and heard more clearly--           ‘Two loving hearts may sever,            For sorrow fails them never.’ And then another voice--           ‘Who knows not love in sorrow’s night,            He knows not love in light.’ In the drawing-room, cool and comfortable in the green shade of the Venetian blinds of the bay window, stood Laura, leaning on the piano, close to Guy, who sat on the music-stool, looking thoroughly at home in his brown shooting-coat, and loosely-tied handkerchief. Any one but Philip would have been out of temper, but he shook hands as cordially as usual, and would not even be the first to remark on the heat. Laura told him he looked hot and tired, and invited him to come out to the others, and cool himself on the lawn. She went for her parasol, Guy ran for her camp stool, and Philip, going to the piano, read what they had been singing. The lines were in Laura’s writing, corrected, here and there, in Guy’s hand.            BE STEADFAST.            Two loving hearts may sever,            Yet love shall fail them never.            Love brightest beams in sorrow’s night,            Love is of life the light.            Two loving hearts may sever,            Yet hope shall fail them never.            Hope is a star in sorrow’s night,            Forget-me-not of light.            Two loving hearts may sever,            Yet faith may fail them never.            Trust on through sorrow’s night,            Faith is of love and hope the light.            Two loving hearts may sever,            For sorrow fails them never.            Who knows not love in sorrow’s night,            He knows not love in light. Philip was by no means pleased. However, it was in anything but a sentimental manner that Guy, looking over him, said, ‘For sever, read, be separated, but “a” wouldn’t rhyme.’ ‘I translated it into prose, and Guy made it verse,’ said Laura; ‘I hope you approve of our performance.’ ‘It is that thing of Helmine von Chezy, “Beharre”, is it not?’ said Philip, particularly civil, because he was so much annoyed. ‘You have rendered the spirit very well’, but you have sacrificed a good deal to your double rhymes.’ ‘Yes; those last lines are not troubled with any equality of feet,’ said Guy; ‘but the repetition is half the beauty. It put me in mind of those lines of Burns--            “Had we never loved so kindly,            Had we never loved so blindly,            Never met and never parted,            We had ne’er been broken hearted;” but there is a trust in these that is more touching than that despair.’ ‘Yes; the despair is ready, to wish the love had never been,’ said Laura. ‘It does not see the star of trust. Why did you use that word “trust” only once, Guy?’ ‘I did not want to lose the three--faith, hope, love,--faith keeping the other two alive.’ ‘My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy.’ ‘Surely,’ said Guy, eagerly, ‘that analogy must be the best part of earthly love.’ Here Charlotte came to see if Guy and Laura meant to sing all the afternoon; and they went out. They found the others in the arbour, and Charlotte’s histories of its construction, gave Philip little satisfaction. They next proceeded to talk over the ball. ‘Ah!’ said Philip, ‘balls are the fashion just now. What do you say, Amy, [he was more inclined to patronize her than any one else] to the gaieties we are going to provide for you?’ ‘You! Are you going to have your new colours? Oh! you are not going to give us a ball?’ ‘Well! that is fun!’ cried Guy. ‘What glory Maurice de Courcy must be in!’ ‘He is gone to Allonby,’ said Philip, ‘to announce it; saying, he must persuade his father to put off their going to Brighton. Do you think he will succeed?’ ‘Hardly,’ said Laura; ‘poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked up by their ball, that she is the more in want of sea air. Oh, mamma, Eva must come and stay here.’ ‘That she must,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘that will make it easy. She is the only one who will care about the ball.’ Philip was obliged to conceal his vexation, and to answer the many eager questions about the arrangements. He stayed to dinner, and as the others went in-doors to dress, he lingered near Charlotte, assuming, with some difficulty, an air of indifference, and said--‘Well, Charlotte, did you tease Guy into showing you those verses?’ ",reign reign thought disdain rival throne rule govern give law subject will stand awe hot afternoon ball walk accelerate pace influence anxious reflection determine speak jest spite extreme youth fear ground suspicion excite hint persuade attachment produce unhappiness cousin consider confidence place guy perceive much inspire affection attractive quality amiable disposition talent music discover power versifying favour ancient name long ancestry confer romantic interest cause feudal feeling head family familiar intercourse increase danger reflect thing tremble feel only protector uncle infatuate listen reason bad morning hear grand inspection regiment presentation colour anxious plain interval officer allow leisure whole affair end ball lead repetition disturb meditate heat dusty walk smooth green enclosure save dancing cloud insect youth whirl face droop heat house door window open seem gasp breath cow seek refuge shade pony droop head leave hang flower faint thirsty bustle stretch stone step mouth open tongue tail move put ear crest head greet arrival hear sound cause motion sympathize tail rich tone guy voice stepp dog enter hear loving heart sever sorrow fail voice love sorrow night love light draw room cool comfortable green shade venetian blind bay window stand lean piano close sit music stool home brown shooting coat tie handkerchief one temper shake hand usual first remark heat hot tired invite other cool lawn parasol run camp stool piano read sing line writing correct hand steadfast loving heart sever love fail love brightest beam sorrow night life light loving heart sever hope fail hope star sorrow night forget light loving heart sever faith fail trust sorrow night love hope light loving heart sever sorrow fail love sorrow night love light means pleased sentimental manner sever read separate rhyme translate prose guy verse hope approve performance thing civil annoyed render spirit sacrifice deal double rhyme last line trouble equality foot guy repetition beauty put mind line love love meet part break hearted trust touch despair despair ready wish love star trust use word trust guy want lose faith hope love faith keep other alive doubt right analogy guy analogy part earthly love mean sing afternoon find other arbour history construction give satisfaction proceed talk ball ball fashion inclined patronize one else gaiety provide new colour give ball fun cry guy glory gone announce persuade father put succeed poor knock ball more want sea air mamma stay easy only one care ball oblige conceal vexation answer many eager question arrangement stay dinner other door dress linger assume difficulty air indifference tease guy show verse 
"‘Oh yes,’ said Charlotte, with what the French call “un air capable”.’ ‘That I mustn’t tell. They were very pretty; but I’ve promised.’ ‘Promised what?’ ‘Never to say anything about them. He made it a condition with me, and I assure you, I am to be trusted.’ ‘Right,’ said Philip; ‘I’ll ask no more.’ ‘It would be of no use,’ said Charlotte, shaking her head, as if she wished he would prove her further. Philip was in hopes of being able to speak to Laura after dinner, but his uncle wanted him to come and look over the plans of an estate adjoining Redclyffe, which there was some idea of purchasing. Such an employment would in general have been congenial; but on this occasion, it was only by a strong force that he could chain his attention, for Guy was pacing the terrace with Laura and Amabel, and as they passed and repassed the window, he now and then caught sounds of repeating poetry. In this Guy excelled. He did not read aloud well; he was too rapid, and eyes and thoughts were apt to travel still faster than the lips, thus producing a confusion; but no one could recite better when a passage had taken strong hold of his imagination, and he gave it the full effect of the modulations of his fine voice, conveying in its inflections the impressions which stirred him profoundly. He was just now enchanted with his first reading of ‘Thalaba,’ where he found all manner of deep meanings, to which the sisters listened with wonder and delight. He repeated, in a low, awful, thrilling tone, that made Amy shudder, the lines in the seventh book, ending with--           “Who comes from the bridal chamber!            It is Azrael, angel of death.”’ ‘You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram.’ said Laura. ‘It is like Sintram,’ he replied. ‘So it seems to me. A strife with the powers of darkness; the victory, forgiveness, resignation, death.           “Thou know’st the secret wishes of my heart,            Do with me as thou wilt, thy will is best.”’ ‘I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself,’ said Amy, ‘you bring the whole Domdaniel round us.’ ‘I am afraid he is going to believe himself Thalaba as well as Sintram,’ said Laura. ‘But you know Southey did not see all this himself, and did not understand it when it was pointed out.’ ‘Don’t tell us that,’ said Amy. ‘Nay; I think there is something striking in it,’ said Guy then, with a sudden transition, ‘but is not this ball famous?’ And their talk was of balls and reviews till nine o’clock, when they were summoned to tea. On the whole, Philip returned to Broadstone by no means comforted. Never had he known so much difficulty in attending with patience to his duties as in the course of the next fortnight. They became a greater durance, as he at length looked his feelings full in the face, and became aware of their true nature. He perceived that the loss of Laura would darken his whole existence; yet he thought that, were he only secure of her happiness, he could have resigned her in silence. Guy was, however, one of the last men in the world whom he could bear to see in possession of her; and probably she was allowing herself to be entangled, if not in heart, at least in manner. If so, she should not be unwarned. He had been her guide from childhood, and he would not fail her now. Three days before the review, he succeeded in finding time for a walk to Hollywell, not fully decided on the part he should act, though resolved on making some remonstrance. He was crossing a stile, about a mile and a half from Hollywell, when he saw a lady sitting on the stump of a tree, sketching, and found that fate had been so propitious as to send Laura thither alone. The rest had gone to gather mushrooms on a down, and had left her sketching the view of the spires of Broadstone, in the cleft between the high green hills. She was very glad to see him, and held up her purple and olive washes to be criticised; but he did not pay much attention to them. He was almost confused at the sudden manner in which the opportunity for speaking had presented itself. ‘It is a long time since I have seen you,’ said he, at last. ‘An unheard-of time.’ ‘Still longer since we have had any conversation.’ ‘I was just thinking so. Not since that hot hay-making, when Guy came home. Indeed, we have had so much amusement lately that I have hardly had time for thought. Guy says we are all growing dissipated.’ ‘Ah! your German, and dancing, and music, do not agree with thought.’ ‘Poor music!’ said Laura, smiling. ‘But I am ready for a lecture; I have been feeling more like a butterfly than I like.’ ‘I know you think me unjust about music, and I freely confess that I cannot estimate the pleasure it affords, but I doubt whether it is a safe pleasure. It forms common ground for persons who would otherwise have little in common, and leads to intimacies which occasion results never looked for.’ ‘Yes,’ said Laura, receiving it as a general maxim. ‘Laura, you complain of feeling like a butterfly. Is not that a sign that you were made for better things?’ ‘But what can I do? I try to read early and at night, but I can’t prevent the fun and gaiety; and, indeed, I don’t think I would. It is innocent, and we never had such a pleasant summer. Charlie is so--so much more equable, and mamma is more easy about him, and I can’t help thinking it does them all good, though I do feel idle.’ ‘It is innocent, it is right for a little while,’ said Philip; ‘but your dissatisfaction proves that you are superior to such things. Laura, what I fear is, that this summer holiday may entangle you, and so fix your fate as to render your life no holiday. O Laura take care; know what you are doing!’ ‘What am I doing?’ asked Laura, with an alarmed look of ingenuous surprise. Never had it been so hard to maintain his composure as now, when her simplicity forced him to come to plainer terms. ‘I must speak,’ he continued, ‘because no one else will. Have you reflected whither this may tend? This music, this versifying, this admitting a stranger so unreservedly into your pursuits?’ She understood now, and hung her head. He would have given worlds to judge of the face hidden by her bonnet; but as she did not reply, he spoke on, his agitation becoming so strong, that the struggle was perceptible in the forced calmness of his tone. ‘I would not say a word if he were worthy, but Laura--Laura, I have seen Locksley Hall acted once; do not let me see it again in a way which--which would give me infinitely more pain.’ The faltering of his voice, so resolutely subdued, touched, her extremely, and a thrill of exquisite pleasure glanced through her, on hearing confirmed what she had long felt, that she had taken Margaret’s place--nay, as she now learnt, that she was even more precious to him. She only thought of reassuring him. ‘No, you need never fear _that_. He has no such thought, I am sure.’ She blushed deeply, but looked in his face. ‘He treats us both alike, besides, he is so young.’ ‘The mischief is not done,’ said Philip, trying to resume his usual tone; ‘I only meant to speak in time. You might let your manner go too far; you might even allow your affections to be involved without knowing it, if you were not on your guard.’ ",call air capable pretty promise promise condition assure trust right ask more use shake head wish prove hope able speak dinner uncle want plan estate adjoin idea purchase employment general congenial occasion strong force chain attention pace terrace pass repass window catch sound repeat poetry guy excell read rapid eye thought apt travel fast lip produce confusion recite passage strong hold imagination give full effect modulation fine voice convey inflection impression stirr enchant first reading find manner deep meaning sister listen wonder delight repeat low awful thrilling tone shudder line seventh book end bridal chamber angel death book reply seem strife power darkness victory forgiveness resignation death secret wish heart wish speak bring whole afraid believe understand point  strike guy sudden transition ball famous talk ball review summon tea whole return means comfort much difficulty attend patience duty course next fortnight become great durance length feeling full face become aware true nature perceive loss dark whole existence secure happiness resign silence guy last man world bear possession allow entangle heart least manner unwarn guide childhood fail day review succeed find time walk decide part act resolve remonstrance cross stile mile half lady sit stump tree sketching find fate propitious send rest gather mushroom down leave sketch view spire cleft high green hill glad hold purple olive wash criticise pay much attention confused sudden manner opportunity speak present long time last unheard time conversation hot hay making guy much amusement time thought guy grow dissipate german dancing music agree thought poor music smile ready lecture feel butterfly like unjust music confess estimate pleasure afford doubt safe pleasure form common ground person common lead intimacy occasion result receive general maxim complain feel butterfly sign thing try read night prevent fun gaiety innocent pleasant summer equable mamma easy help feel idle innocent right while dissatisfaction prove superior such thing fear summer holiday entangle fix fate render life holiday care ask alarm ingenuous surprise hard maintain composure simplicity force plainer term speak continue else reflect tend music versifying admit stranger pursuit understand hang head give world judge face hide bonnet reply speak agitation become strong struggle perceptible force calmness tone word worthy act let way give more pain falter voice subdued touch thrill exquisite pleasure glance hearing confirm feel place learn precious reassure fear such thought sure blush face treat alike young mischief try resume usual tone mean speak time let manner allow affection involve guard
