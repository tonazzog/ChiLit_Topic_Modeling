"CHAPTER V. THE PARROT IN HIS SHAWL.           That handkerchief   Did an Egyptian to my mother give;   She was a charmer, and could almost read   The thoughts of people.--_Othello._  ""That gypsy woman who is coming with her cart,"" said the parrot, ""is a fairy too, and very malicious. It was she and others of her tribe who caught us and put us into these cages, for they are more powerful than we. Mind you do not let her allure you into the woods, nor wheedle you or frighten you into giving her any of those fairies."" ""No,"" said Jack; ""I will not."" ""She sold us to the brown people,"" continued the parrot. ""Mind you do not buy anything of her, for your money in her palm would act as a charm against you."" ""She has a baby,"" observed the parrot-wife, scornfully. ""Yes, a baby,"" repeated the old parrot; ""and I hope by means of that baby to get her driven away, and perhaps get free myself. I shall try to put her in a passion. Here she comes."" There she was indeed, almost close at hand. She had a little cart; her goods were hung all about it, and a small horse drew it slowly on, and stopped when she got a customer. Several gypsy children were with her, and as the people came running together over the grass to see her goods, she sang a curious kind of song, which made them wish to buy them. Jack turned from the parrot's cage as she came up. He had heard her singing a little way off, and now, before she began again, he felt that already her searching eyes had found him out, and taken notice that he was different from the other people. When she began to sing her selling song, he felt a most curious sensation. He felt as if there were some cobwebs before his face, and he put up his hand as if to clear them away. There were no real cobwebs, of course; and yet he again felt as if they floated from the gypsy woman to him, like gossamer threads, and attracted him towards her. So he gazed at her, and she at him, till Jack began to forget how the parrot had warned him. He saw her baby too, wondered whether it was heavy for her to carry, and wished he could help her. I mean, he saw that she had a baby on her arm. It was wrapped in a shawl, and had a handkerchief over its face. She seemed very fond of it, for she kept hushing it; and Jack softly moved nearer and nearer to the cart, till the gypsy woman smiled, and suddenly began to sing,--   My good man--he's an old, old man     And my good man got a fall,   To buy me a bargain so fast he ran     When he heard the gypsies call:         ""Buy, buy brushes,         Baskets wrought o' rushes.         Buy them, buy them, take them, try them,               Buy, dames all.""   My old man, he has money and land,     And a young, young wife am I.   Let him put the penny in my white hand     When he hears the gypsies cry:         ""Buy, buy laces,         Veils to screen your faces.         Buy them, buy them, take and try them.               Buy, maids, buy."" When the gypsy had finished her song, Jack felt as if he was covered all over with cobwebs; but he could not move away, and he did not mind them now. All his wish was to please her, and get close to her; so when she said, in a soft, wheedling voice, ""What will you please to buy, my pretty gentleman?"" he was just going to answer that he would buy anything she recommended, when, to his astonishment and displeasure, for he thought it very rude, the parrot suddenly burst into a violent fit of coughing, which made all the customers stare. ""That's to clear my throat,"" he said, in a most impertinent tone of voice; and then he began to beat time with his foot, and sing, or rather scream out, an extremely saucy imitation of the gypsy's song, and all his parrot friends in the other cages joined in the chorus.   My fair lady's a dear, dear lady--     I walked by her side to woo.   In a garden alley, so sweet and shady,     She answered, ""I love not you,         John, John Brady,""         Quoth my dear lady,   ""Pray now, pray now, go your way now,         Do, John, do!"" At first the gypsy did not seem to know where that mocking song came from, but when she discovered that it was her prisoner, the old parrot, who was thus daring to imitate her, she stood silent and glared at him, and her face was almost white with rage. When he came to the end of the verse he pretended to burst into a violent fit of sobbing and crying, and screeched out to his wife, ""Mate! mate! hand up my handkerchief. Oh! oh! it's so affecting, this song is."" Upon this the other parrot pulled Jack's handkerchief from under her wing, hobbled up, and began, with a great show of zeal, to wipe his horny beak with it. But this was too much for the gypsy; she took a large brush from her cart, and flung it at the cage with all her might. This set it violently swinging backwards and forwards, but did not stop the parrot, who screeched out, ""How delightful it is to be swung!"" And then he began to sing another verse in the most impudent tone possible, and with a voice that seemed to ring through Jack's head, and almost pierce it:--   Yet my fair lady's my own, own lady,     For I passed another day;   While making her moan, she sat all alone,     And thus and thus did she say:         ""John, John Brady,""         Quoth my dear lady,   ""Do now, do now, once more woo now,         Pray, John, pray!"" ""It's beautiful!"" screeched the parrot-wife, ""and so ap-pro-pri-ate."" Jack was delighted when she managed slowly to say this long word with her black tongue, and he burst out laughing. In the mean time a good many of the brown people came running together, attracted by the noise of the parrots and the rage of the gypsy, who flung at his cage, one after the other, all the largest things she had in her cart. But nothing did the parrot any harm; the more violently his cage swung, the louder he sang, till at last the wicked gypsy seized her poor little young baby, who was lying in her arms, rushed frantically at the cage as it flew swiftly through the air towards her, and struck at it with the little creature's head. ""Oh, you cruel, cruel woman!"" cried Jack, and all the small mothers who were standing near with their skinny children on their shoulders, screamed out with terror and indignation; but only for one instant, for the handkerchief flew off that had covered its face, and was caught in the wires of the cage, and all the people saw that it was not a real baby at all, but a bundle of clothes, and its head was a turnip.

"Yes, a turnip! You could see that as plainly as possible, for though the green leaves had been cut off, their stalks were visible through the lace cap that had been tied on it. Upon this all the crowd pressed closer, throwing her baskets, and brushes, and laces, and beads at the gypsy, and calling out, ""We will have none of your goods, you false woman! Give us back our money, or we will drive you out of the fair. You've stuck a stick into a turnip, and dressed it up in baby clothes. You're a cheat! a cheat!"" ""My sweet gentlemen, my kind ladies,"" began the gypsy; but baskets and brushes flew at her so fast that she was obliged to sit down on the grass and hold up the sham baby to screen her face. While this was going on, Jack felt that the cobwebs which had seemed to float about his face were all gone; he did not care at all any more about the gypsy, and began to watch the parrots with great attention. He observed that when the handkerchief stuck between the cage wires, the parrots caught it, and drew it inside; and then Jack saw the cunning old bird himself lay it on the floor, fold it crosswise like a shawl, and put it on his wife. Then she jumped upon the perch, and held it with one foot, looking precisely like an old lady with a parrot's head. Then he folded Jack's handkerchief in the same way, put it on, and got upon the perch beside his wife, screaming out, in his most piercing tone,-- ""I like shawls; they're so becoming."" Now the gypsy did not care at all what those inferior people thought of her, and she was calmly counting out their money, to return it; but she was very desirous to make Jack forget her behavior, and had begun to smile again, and tell him she had only been joking, when the parrot spoke, and, looking up, she saw the two birds sitting side by side, and the parrot-wife was screaming in her mate's ear, though neither of them was at all deaf,-- ""If Jack lets her allure him into the woods, he'll never come out again. She'll hang him up in a cage, as she did us. I say, how does my shawl fit?"" So saying, the parrot-wife whisked herself round on the perch, and lo! in the corner of the handkerchief were seen some curious letters, marked in red. When the crowd saw these, they drew a little farther off, and glanced at one another with alarm. ""You look charming, my dear; it fits well!"" screamed the old parrot in answer. ""A word in your ear; 'Share and share alike' is a fine motto."" ""What do you mean by all this?"" said the gypsy, rising, and going with slow steps to the cage, and speaking cautiously. ""Jack,"" said the parrot, ""do they ever eat handkerchiefs in your part of the country?"" ""No, never,"" answered Jack. ""Hold your tongue and be reasonable,"" said the gypsy, trembling. ""What do you want? I'll do it, whatever it is."" ""But do they never pick out the marks?"" continued the parrot. ""O Jack! are you sure they never pick out the marks?"" ""The marks?"" said Jack, considering. ""Yes, perhaps they do."" ""Stop!"" cried the gypsy, as the old parrot made a peck at the strange letters. ""Oh! you're hurting me. What do you want? I say again, tell me what you want, and you shall have it."" ""We want to get out,"" replied the parrot; ""you must undo the spell."" ""Then give me my handkerchief,"" answered the gypsy, ""to bandage my eyes. I dare not say the words with my eyes open. You had no business to steal it. It was woven by human hands, so that nobody can see through it; and if you don't give it to me, you'll never get out,--no, never!"" ""Then,"" said the old parrot, tossing his shawl off, ""you may have Jack's handkerchief; it will bandage your eyes just as well. It was woven over the water, as yours was."" ""It won't do!"" cried the gypsy, in terror; ""give me my own."" ""I tell you,"" answered the parrot, ""that you shall have Jack's handkerchief; you can do no harm with that."" By this time the parrots all around had become perfectly silent, and none of the people ventured to say a word, for they feared the malice of the gypsy. She was trembling dreadfully, and her dark eyes, which had been so bright and piercing, had become dull and almost dim; but when she found there was no help for it, she said,-- ""Well, pass out Jack's handkerchief. I will set you free if you will bring out mine with you."" ""Share and share alike,"" answered the parrot; ""you must let all my friends out too."" ""Then I won't let you out,"" answered the gypsy. ""You shall come out first, and give me my handkerchief, or not one of their cages will I undo. So take your choice."" ""My friends, then,"" answered the brave old parrot; and he poked Jack's handkerchief out to her through the wires. The wondering crowd stood by to look, and the gypsy bandaged her eyes tightly with the handkerchief; and then, stooping low, she began to murmur something and clap her hands--softly at first, but by degrees more and more violently. The noise was meant to drown the words she muttered; but as she went on clapping, the bottom of cage after cage fell clattering down. Out flew the parrots by hundreds, screaming and congratulating one another; and there was such a deafening din that not only the sound of her spell, but the clapping of her hands, was quite lost in it. But all this time Jack was very busy; for the moment the gypsy had tied up her eyes, the old parrot snatched the real handkerchief off his wife's shoulders, and tied it round her neck. Then she pushed out her head through the wires, and the old parrot called to Jack, and said, ""Pull!"" Jack took the ends of the handkerchief, pulled terribly hard, and stopped. ""Go on! go on!"" screamed the old parrot. ""I shall pull her head off,"" cried Jack. ""No matter,"" cried the parrot; ""no matter,--only pull."" Well, Jack did pull, and he actually did pull her head off! nearly tumbling backward himself as he did it; but he saw what the whole thing meant then, for there was another head inside,--a fairy's head. Jack flung down the old parrot's head and great beak, for he saw that what he had to do was to clear the fairy of its parrot covering. The poor little creature seemed nearly dead, it was so terribly squeezed in the wires. It had a green gown or robe on, with an ermine collar; and Jack got hold of this dress, stripped the fairy out of the parrot feathers, and dragged her through,--velvet robe, and crimson girdle, and little yellow shoes. She was very much exhausted, but a kind brown woman took her instantly, and laid her in her bosom. She was a splendid little creature, about half a foot long.
