Nesbit\n\n          TO\n          Dr Wallis Budge\n          of the British Museum as a\n          small token of gratitude for his\n          unfailing kindness and help\n          in the making of it\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE PSAMMEAD\n\nThere were once four children who spent their summer holidays in a white\nhouse, happily situated between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One day they\nhad the good fortune to find in the sandpit a strange creature. Its eyes\nwere on long horns like snail’s eyes, and it could move them in and out\nlike telescopes. It had ears like a bat’s ears, and its tubby body was\nshaped like a spider’s and covered with thick soft fur--and it had hands\nand feet like a monkey’s. It told the children--whose names were\nCyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane--that it was a Psammead or sand-fairy.\n(Psammead is pronounced Sammy-ad.) It was old, old, old, and its\nbirthday was almost at the very beginning of everything. And it had\nbeen buried in the sand for thousands of years. But it still kept its\nfairylikeness, and part of this fairylikeness was its power to give\npeople whatever they wished for. You know fairies have always been able\nto do this. Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane now found their wishes come\ntrue; but, somehow, they never could think of just the right things to\nwish for, and their wishes sometimes turned out very oddly indeed. In\nthe end their unwise wishings landed them in what Robert called ‘a very\ntight place indeed’, and the Psammead consented to help them out of it\nin return for their promise never never to ask it to grant them any more\nwishes, and never to tell anyone about it, because it did not want to\nbe bothered to give wishes to anyone ever any more. At the moment of\nparting Jane said politely--\n\n‘I wish we were going to see you again some day.’\n\nAnd the Psammead, touched by this friendly thought, granted the wish.\nThe book about all this is called Five Children and It, and it ends up\nin a most tiresome way by saying--\n\n‘The children DID see the Psammead again, but it was not in the sandpit;\nit was--but I must say no more--’\n\nThe reason that nothing more could be said was that I had not then been\nable to find out exactly when and where the children met the Psammead\nagain. Of course I knew they would meet it, because it was a beast of\nits word, and when it said a thing would happen, that thing happened\nwithout fail. How different from the people who tell us about what\nweather it is going to be on Thursday next, in London, the South Coast,\nand Channel!\n\nThe summer holidays during which the Psammead had been found and\nthe wishes given had been wonderful holidays in the country, and the\nchildren had the highest hopes of just such another holiday for the next\nsummer. The winter holidays were beguiled by the wonderful happenings\nof The Phoenix and the Carpet, and the loss of these two treasures would\nhave left the children in despair, but for the splendid hope of their\nnext holiday in the country. The world, they felt, and indeed had some\nreason to feel, was full of wonderful things--and they were really the\nsort of people that wonderful things happen to. So they looked forward\nto the summer holiday; but when it came everything was different, and\nvery, very horrid. Father had to go out to Manchuria to telegraph news\nabout the war to the tiresome paper he wrote for--the Daily Bellower,\nor something like that, was its name. And Mother, poor dear Mother, was\naway in Madeira, because she had been very ill. And The Lamb--I mean the\nbaby--was with her. And Aunt Emma, who was Mother’s sister, had suddenly\nmarried Uncle Reginald, who was Father’s brother, and they had gone to\nChina, which is much too far off for you to expect to be asked to spend\nthe holidays in, however fond your aunt and uncle may be of you. So\nthe children were left in the care of old Nurse, who lived in Fitzroy\nStreet, near the British Museum, and though she was always very kind to\nthem, and indeed spoiled them far more than would be good for the most\ngrown-up of us, the four children felt perfectly wretched, and when\nthe cab had driven off with Father and all his boxes and guns and the\nsheepskin, with blankets and the aluminium mess-kit inside it, the\nstoutest heart quailed, and the girls broke down altogether, and sobbed\nin each other’s arms, while the boys each looked out of one of the long\ngloomy windows of the parlour, and tried to pretend that no boy would be\nsuch a muff as to cry.\n\nI hope you notice that they were not cowardly enough to cry till their\nFather had gone; they knew he had quite enough to upset him without\nthat. But when he was gone everyone felt as if it had been trying not to\ncry all its life, and that it must cry now, if it died for it. So they\ncried.\n\nTea--with shrimps and watercress--cheered them a little. The watercress\nwas arranged in a hedge round a fat glass salt-cellar, a tasteful device\nthey had never seen before. But it was not a cheerful meal.\n\nAfter tea Anthea went up to the room that had been Father’s, and when\nshe saw how dreadfully he wasn’t there, and remembered how every minute\nwas taking him further and further from her, and nearer and nearer to\nthe guns of the Russians, she cried a little more. Then she thought of\nMother, ill and alone, and perhaps at that very moment wanting a little\ngirl to put eau-de-cologne on her head, and make her sudden cups of tea,\nand she cried more than ever. And then she remembered what Mother had\nsaid, the night before she went away, about Anthea being the eldest\ngirl, and about trying to make the others happy, and things like that.\nSo she stopped crying, and thought instead. And when she had thought as\nlong as she could bear she washed her face and combed her hair, and went\ndown to the others, trying her best to look as though crying were an\nexercise she had never even heard of.\n\nShe found the parlour in deepest gloom, hardly relieved at all by\nthe efforts of Robert, who, to make the time pass, was pulling Jane’s\nhair--not hard, but just enough to tease.\n\n‘Look here,’ said Anthea. ‘Let’s have a palaver.’ This word dated from\nthe awful day when Cyril had carelessly wished that there were Red\nIndians in England--and there had been. The word brought back memories\nof last summer holidays and everyone groaned; they thought of the white\nhouse with the beautiful tangled garden--late roses, asters, marigold,\nsweet mignonette, and feathery asparagus--of the wilderness which\nsomeone had once meant to make into an orchard, but which was now,\nas Father said, ‘five acres of thistles haunted by the ghosts of baby\ncherry-trees’. They thought of the view across the valley, where the\nlime-kilns looked like Aladdin’s palaces in the sunshine, and they\nthought of their own sandpit, with its fringe of yellowy grasses and\npale-stringy-stalked wild flowers, and the little holes in the cliff\nthat were the little sand-martins’ little front doors. And they thought\nof the free fresh air smelling of thyme and sweetbriar, and the scent of\nthe wood-smoke from the cottages in the lane--and they looked round old\nNurse’s stuffy parlour, and Jane said--\n\n‘Oh, how different it all is!’\n\nIt was. Old Nurse had been in the habit of letting lodgings, till Father\ngave her the children to take care of. And her rooms were furnished ‘for\nletting’. Now it is a very odd thing that no one ever seems to furnish\na room ‘for letting’ in a bit the same way as one would furnish it for\nliving in. This room had heavy dark red stuff curtains--the colour that\nblood would not make a stain on--with coarse lace curtains inside. The\ncarpet was yellow, and violet, with bits of grey and brown oilcloth in\nodd places. The fireplace had shavings and tinsel in it. There was\na very varnished mahogany chiffonier, or sideboard, with a lock that\nwouldn’t act. There were hard chairs--far too many of them--with crochet\nantimacassars slipping off their seats, all of which sloped the wrong\nway. The table wore a cloth of a cruel green colour with a yellow\nchain-stitch pattern round it. Over the fireplace was a looking-glass\nthat made you look much uglier than you really were, however plain you\nmight be to begin with. Then there was a mantelboard with maroon plush\nand wool fringe that did not match the plush; a dreary clock like a\nblack marble tomb--it was silent as the grave too, for it had long since\nforgotten how to tick. And there were painted glass vases that never had\nany flowers in, and a painted tambourine that no one ever played, and\npainted brackets with nothing on them.\n\n     ‘And maple-framed engravings of the Queen, the Houses of\n  Parliament, the Plains of Heaven, and of a blunt-nosed\n  woodman’s flat return.’\n\nThere were two books--last December’s Bradshaw, and an odd volume of\nPlumridge’s Commentary on Thessalonians. There were--but I cannot\ndwell longer on this painful picture. It was indeed, as Jane said, very\ndifferent.\n\n‘Let’s have a palaver,’ said Anthea again.\n\n‘What about?’ said Cyril, yawning.\n\n‘There’s nothing to have ANYTHING about,’ said Robert kicking the leg of\nthe table miserably.\n\n‘I don’t want to play,’ said Jane, and her tone was grumpy.\n\nAnthea tried very hard not to be cross. She succeeded.\n\n‘Look here,’ she said, ‘don’t think I want to be preachy or a beast in\nany way, but I want to what Father calls define the situation. Do you\nagree?’\n\n‘Fire ahead,’ said Cyril without enthusiasm.\n\n‘Well then. We all know the reason we’re staying here is because Nurse\ncouldn’t leave her house on account of the poor learned gentleman on the\ntop-floor. And there was no one else Father could entrust to take care\nof us--and you know it’s taken a lot of money, Mother’s going to Madeira\nto be made well.’\n\nJane sniffed miserably.\n\n‘Yes, I know,’ said Anthea in a hurry, ‘but don’t let’s think about how\nhorrid it all is. I mean we can’t go to things that cost a lot, but we\nmust do SOMETHING. And I know there are heaps of things you can see in\nLondon without paying for them, and I thought we’d go and see them. We\nare all quite old now, and we haven’t got The Lamb--’\n\nJane sniffed harder than before.\n\n‘I mean no one can say “No” because of him, dear pet. And I thought\nwe MUST get Nurse to see how quite old we are, and let us go out by\nourselves, or else we shall never have any sort of a time at all. And I\nvote we see everything there is, and let’s begin by asking Nurse to give\nus some bits of bread and we’ll go to St James’s Park. There are ducks\nthere, I know, we can feed them. Only we must make Nurse let us go by\nourselves.’\n\n‘Hurrah for liberty!’ said Robert, ‘but she won’t.’\n\n‘Yes she will,’ said Jane unexpectedly. ‘_I_ thought about that this\nmorning, and I asked Father, and he said yes; and what’s more he told\nold Nurse we might, only he said we must always say where we wanted to\ngo, and if it was right she would let us.’\n\n‘Three cheers for thoughtful Jane,’ cried Cyril, now roused at last from\nhis yawning despair. ‘I say, let’s go now.’\n\nSo they went, old Nurse only begging them to be careful of crossings,\nand to ask a policeman to assist in the more difficult cases. But they\nwere used to crossings, for they had lived in Camden Town and knew the\nKentish Town Road where the trams rush up and down like mad at all hours\nof the day and night, and seem as though, if anything, they would rather\nrun over you than not.\n\nThey had promised to be home by dark, but it was July, so dark would be\nvery late indeed, and long past bedtime.\n\nThey started to walk to St James’s Park, and all their pockets were\nstuffed with bits of bread and the crusts of toast, to feed the ducks\nwith. They started, I repeat, but they never got there.\n\nBetween Fitzroy Street and St James’s Park there are a great many\nstreets, and, if you go the right way you will pass a great many shops\nthat you cannot possibly help stopping to look at. The children stopped\nto look at several with gold-lace and beads and pictures and jewellery\nand dresses, and hats, and oysters and lobsters in their windows, and\ntheir sorrow did not seem nearly so impossible to bear as it had done in\nthe best parlour at No. 300, Fitzroy Street.\n\nPresently, by some wonderful chance turn of Robert’s (who had been voted\nCaptain because the girls thought it would be good for him--and indeed\nhe thought so himself--and of course Cyril couldn’t vote against him\nbecause it would have looked like a mean jealousy), they came into the\nlittle interesting criss-crossy streets that held the most interesting\nshops of all--the shops where live things were sold. There was one shop\nwindow entirely filled with cages, and all sorts of beautiful birds in\nthem. The children were delighted till they remembered how they had once\nwished for wings themselves, and had had them--and then they felt how\ndesperately unhappy anything with wings must be if it is shut up in a\ncage and not allowed to fly.\n\n‘It must be fairly beastly to be a bird in a cage,’ said Cyril. ‘Come\non!’\n\nThey went on, and Cyril tried to think out a scheme for making his\nfortune as a gold-digger at Klondyke, and then buying all the caged\nbirds in the world and setting them free. Then they came to a shop that\nsold cats, but the cats were in cages, and the children could not help\nwishing someone would buy all the cats and put them on hearthrugs, which\nare the proper places for cats. And there was the dog-shop, and that was\nnot a happy thing to look at either, because all the dogs were chained\nor caged, and all the dogs, big and little, looked at the four children\nwith sad wistful eyes and wagged beseeching tails as if they were trying\nto say, ‘Buy me! buy me! buy me! and let me go for a walk with you; oh,\ndo buy me, and buy my poor brothers too! Do! do! do!’ They almost said,\n‘Do! do! do!’ plain to the ear, as they whined; all but one big Irish\nterrier, and he growled when Jane patted him.\n\n‘Grrrrr,’ he seemed to say, as he looked at them from the back corner\nof his eye--‘YOU won’t buy me. Nobody will--ever--I shall die chained\nup--and I don’t know that I care how soon it is, either!’\n\nI don’t know that the children would have understood all this, only once\nthey had been in a besieged castle, so they knew how hateful it is to be\nkept in when you want to get out.\n\nOf course they could not buy any of the dogs. They did, indeed, ask the\nprice of the very, very smallest, and it was sixty-five pounds--but that\nwas because it was a Japanese toy spaniel like the Queen once had her\nportrait painted with, when she was only Princess of Wales. But the\nchildren thought, if the smallest was all that money, the biggest would\nrun into thousands--so they went on.\n\nAnd they did not stop at any more cat or dog or bird shops, but passed\nthem by, and at last they came to a shop that seemed as though it only\nsold creatures that did not much mind where they were--such as goldfish\nand white mice, and sea-anemones and other aquarium beasts, and\nlizards and toads, and hedgehogs and tortoises, and tame rabbits\nand guinea-pigs. And there they stopped for a long time, and fed the\nguinea-pigs with bits of bread through the cage-bars, and wondered\nwhether it would be possible to keep a sandy-coloured double-lop in the\nbasement of the house in Fitzroy Street.\n\n‘I don’t suppose old Nurse would mind VERY much,’ said Jane. ‘Rabbits\nare most awfully tame sometimes. I expect it would know her voice and\nfollow her all about.’\n\n‘She’d tumble over it twenty times a day,’ said Cyril; ‘now a snake--’\n\n‘There aren’t any snakes, said Robert hastily, ‘and besides, I never\ncould cotton to snakes somehow--I wonder why.’\n\n‘Worms are as bad,’ said Anthea, ‘and eels and slugs--I think it’s\nbecause we don’t like things that haven’t got legs.’\n\n‘Father says snakes have got legs hidden away inside of them,’ said\nRobert.\n\n‘Yes--and he says WE’VE got tails hidden away inside us--but it doesn’t\neither of it come to anything REALLY,’ said Anthea. ‘I hate things that\nhaven’t any legs.’\n\n‘It’s worse when they have too many,’ said Jane with a shudder, ‘think\nof centipedes!’\n\nThey stood there on the pavement, a cause of some inconvenience to\nthe passersby, and thus beguiled the time with conversation. Cyril was\nleaning his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they\nhad inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one, and he was trying\nto reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself into a\nball earlier in the interview, when a small, soft voice just below his\nelbow said, quietly, plainly and quite unmistakably--not in any squeak\nor whine that had to be translated--but in downright common English--\n\n‘Buy me--do--please buy me!’\n\nCyril started as though he had been pinched, and jumped a yard away from\nthe hutch.\n\n‘Come back--oh, come back!’ said the voice, rather louder but still\nsoftly; ‘stoop down and pretend to be tying up your bootlace--I see it’s\nundone, as usual.’\n\nCyril mechanically obeyed. He knelt on one knee on the dry, hot dusty\npavement, peered into the darkness of the hutch and found himself face\nto face with--the Psammead!\n\nIt seemed much thinner than when he had last seen it. It was dusty and\ndirty, and its fur was untidy and ragged. It had hunched itself up into\na miserable lump, and its long snail’s eyes were drawn in quite tight so\nthat they hardly showed at all.\n\n‘Listen,’ said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as though it would\nbegin to cry in a minute, ‘I don’t think the creature who keeps this\nshop will ask a very high price for me. I’ve bitten him more than once,\nand I’ve made myself look as common as I can. He’s never had a glance\nfrom my beautiful, beautiful eyes. Tell the others I’m here--but tell\nthem to look at some of those low, common beasts while I’m talking to\nyou. The creature inside mustn’t think you care much about me, or he’ll\nput a price upon me far, far beyond your means. I remember in the dear\nold days last summer you never had much money. Oh--I never thought I\nshould be so glad to see you--I never did.’ It sniffed, and shot out its\nlong snail’s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur. ‘Tell\nthe others I’m here, and then I’ll tell you exactly what to do about\nbuying me.’ Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot, stood up and\naddressed the others in firm tones--\n\n‘Look here,’ he said, ‘I’m not kidding--and I appeal to your honour,’ an\nappeal which in this family was never made in vain. ‘Don’t look at that\nhutch--look at the white rat. Now you are not to look at that hutch\nwhatever I say.’\n\nHe stood in front of it to prevent mistakes.\n\n‘Now get yourselves ready for a great surprise. In that hutch there’s\nan old friend of ours--DON’T look!--Yes; it’s the Psammead, the good old\nPsammead! it wants us to buy it. It says you’re not to look at it. Look\nat the white rat and count your money! On your honour don’t look!’\n\nThe others responded nobly. They looked at the white rat till they quite\nstared him out of countenance, so that he went and sat up on his hind\nlegs in a far corner and hid his eyes with his front paws, and pretended\nhe was washing his face.\n\nCyril stooped again, busying himself with the other bootlace and\nlistened for the Psammead’s further instructions.\n\n‘Go in,’ said the Psammead, ‘and ask the price of lots of other things.\nThen say, “What do you want for that monkey that’s lost its tail--the\nmangy old thing in the third hutch from the end.” Oh--don’t mind MY\nfeelings--call me a mangy monkey--I’ve tried hard enough to look like\none! I don’t think he’ll put a high price on me--I’ve bitten him eleven\ntimes since I came here the day before yesterday. If he names a bigger\nprice than you can afford, say you wish you had the money.’\n\n‘But you can’t give us wishes. I’ve promised never to have another wish\nfrom you,’ said the bewildered Cyril.\n\n‘Don’t be a silly little idiot,’ said the Sand-fairy in trembling but\naffectionate tones, ‘but find out how much money you’ve got between you,\nand do exactly what I tell you.’\n\nCyril, pointing a stiff and unmeaning finger at the white rat, so as to\npretend that its charms alone employed his tongue, explained matters to\nthe others, while the Psammead hunched itself, and bunched itself,\nand did its very best to make itself look uninteresting. Then the four\nchildren filed into the shop.\n\n‘How much do you want for that white rat?’ asked Cyril.\n\n‘Eightpence,’ was the answer.\n\n‘And the guinea-pigs?’\n\n‘Eighteenpence to five bob, according to the breed.’\n\n‘And the lizards?’\n\n‘Ninepence each.’\n\n‘And toads?’\n\n‘Fourpence. Now look here,’ said the greasy owner of all this caged life\nwith a sudden ferocity which made the whole party back hurriedly on to\nthe wainscoting of hutches with which the shop was lined. ‘Lookee here.\nI ain’t agoin’ to have you a comin’ in here a turnin’ the whole place\nouter winder, an’ prizing every animile in the stock just for your\nlarks, so don’t think it! If you’re a buyer, BE a buyer--but I never\nhad a customer yet as wanted to buy mice, and lizards, and toads, and\nguineas all at once. So hout you goes.’\n\n‘Oh! wait a minute,’ said the wretched Cyril, feeling how foolishly yet\nwell-meaningly he had carried out the Psammead’s instructions. ‘Just\ntell me one thing. What do you want for the mangy old monkey in the\nthird hutch from the end?’\n\nThe shopman only saw in this a new insult.\n\n‘Mangy young monkey yourself,’ said he; ‘get along with your blooming\ncheek. Hout you goes!’\n\n‘Oh! don’t be so cross,’ said Jane, losing her head altogether, ‘don’t\nyou see he really DOES want to know THAT!’\n\n‘Ho! does ‘e indeed,’ sneered the merchant. Then he scratched his ear\nsuspiciously, for he was a sharp business man, and he knew the ring of\ntruth when he heard it. His hand was bandaged, and three minutes\nbefore he would have been glad to sell the ‘mangy old monkey’ for ten\nshillings. Now--‘Ho! ‘e does, does ‘e,’ he said, ‘then two pun ten’s my\nprice. He’s not got his fellow that monkey ain’t, nor yet his match,\nnot this side of the equator, which he comes from. And the only one ever\nseen in London. Ought to be in the Zoo. Two pun ten, down on the nail,\nor hout you goes!’\n\nThe children looked at each other--twenty-three shillings and fivepence\nwas all they had in the world, and it would have been merely three and\nfivepence, but for the sovereign which Father had given to them ‘between\nthem’ at parting. ‘We’ve only twenty-three shillings and fivepence,’\nsaid Cyril, rattling the money in his pocket.\n\n‘Twenty-three farthings and somebody’s own cheek,’ said the dealer, for\nhe did not believe that Cyril had so much money.\n\nThere was a miserable pause. Then Anthea remembered, and said--\n\n‘Oh! I WISH I had two pounds ten.’\n\n‘So do I, Miss, I’m sure,’ said the man with bitter politeness; ‘I wish\nyou ‘ad, I’m sure!’\n\nAnthea’s hand was on the counter, something seemed to slide under it.\nShe lifted it. There lay five bright half sovereigns.\n\n‘Why, I HAVE got it after all,’ she said; ‘here’s the money, now let’s\nhave the Sammy,... the monkey I mean.’\n\nThe dealer looked hard at the money, but he made haste to put it in his\npocket.\n\n‘I only hope you come by it honest,’ he said, shrugging his shoulders.\nHe scratched his ear again.\n\n‘Well!’ he said, ‘I suppose I must let you have it, but it’s worth\nthribble the money, so it is--’\n\nHe slowly led the way out to the hutch--opened the door gingerly,\nand made a sudden fierce grab at the Psammead, which the Psammead\nacknowledged in one last long lingering bite.\n\n‘Here, take the brute,’ said the shopman, squeezing the Psammead so\ntight that he nearly choked it. ‘It’s bit me to the marrow, it have.’\n\nThe man’s eyes opened as Anthea held out her arms.\n\n‘Don’t blame me if it tears your face off its bones,’ he said, and the\nPsammead made a leap from his dirty horny hands, and Anthea caught it\nin hers, which were not very clean, certainly, but at any rate were soft\nand pink, and held it kindly and closely.\n\n‘But you can’t take it home like that,’ Cyril said, ‘we shall have a\ncrowd after us,’ and indeed two errand boys and a policeman had already\ncollected.\n\n‘I can’t give you nothink only a paper-bag, like what we put the\ntortoises in,’ said the man grudgingly.\n\nSo the whole party went into the shop, and the shopman’s eyes nearly\ncame out of his head when, having given Anthea the largest paper-bag he\ncould find, he saw her hold it open, and the Psammead carefully creep\ninto it. ‘Well!’ he said, ‘if that there don’t beat cockfighting! But\np’raps you’ve met the brute afore.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Cyril affably, ‘he’s an old friend of ours.’\n\n‘If I’d a known that,’ the man rejoined, ‘you shouldn’t a had him under\ntwice the money. ‘Owever,’ he added, as the children disappeared, ‘I\nain’t done so bad, seeing as I only give five bob for the beast. But\nthen there’s the bites to take into account!’\n\nThe children trembling in agitation and excitement, carried home the\nPsammead, trembling in its paper-bag.\n\nWhen they got it home, Anthea nursed it, and stroked it, and would have\ncried over it, if she hadn’t remembered how it hated to be wet.\n\nWhen it recovered enough to speak, it said--\n\n‘Get me sand; silver sand from the oil and colour shop. And get me\nplenty.’\n\nThey got the sand, and they put it and the Psammead in the round bath\ntogether, and it rubbed itself, and rolled itself, and shook itself and\nscraped itself, and scratched itself, and preened itself, till it felt\nclean and comfy, and then it scrabbled a hasty hole in the sand, and\nwent to sleep in it.\n\nThe children hid the bath under the girls’ bed, and had supper. Old\nNurse had got them a lovely supper of bread and butter and fried onions.\nShe was full of kind and delicate thoughts.\n\nWhen Anthea woke the next morning, the Psammead was snuggling down\nbetween her shoulder and Jane’s.\n\n‘You have saved my life,’ it said. ‘I know that man would have thrown\ncold water on me sooner or later, and then I should have died. I saw him\nwash out a guinea-pig’s hutch yesterday morning. I’m still frightfully\nsleepy, I think I’ll go back to sand for another nap. Wake the boys and\nthis dormouse of a Jane, and when you’ve had your breakfasts we’ll have\na talk.’\n\n‘Don’t YOU want any breakfast?’ asked Anthea.\n\n‘I daresay I shall pick a bit presently,’ it said; ‘but sand is all I\ncare about--it’s meat and drink to me, and coals and fire and wife and\nchildren.’ With these words it clambered down by the bedclothes and\nscrambled back into the bath, where they heard it scratching itself out\nof sight.\n\n‘Well!’ said Anthea, ‘anyhow our holidays won’t be dull NOW. We’ve found\nthe Psammead again.’\n\n‘No,’ said Jane, beginning to put on her stockings. ‘We shan’t be\ndull--but it’ll be only like having a pet dog now it can’t give us\nwishes.’\n\n‘Oh, don’t be so discontented,’ said Anthea. ‘If it can’t do anything\nelse it can tell us about Megatheriums and things.’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE HALF AMULET\n\nLong ago--that is to say last summer--the children, finding themselves\nembarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted them, and which\nthe servants had not received in a proper spirit, had wished that the\nservants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead gave. And when\nthey parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that they should\nmeet it again. Therefore they HAD met it (and it was jolly lucky for\nthe Psammead, as Robert pointed out). Now, of course, you see that\nthe Psammead’s being where it was, was the consequence of one of their\nwishes, and therefore was a Psammead-wish, and as such could not be\nnoticed by the servants. And it was soon plain that in the Psammead’s\nopinion old Nurse was still a servant, although she had now a house\nof her own, for she never noticed the Psammead at all. And that was as\nwell, for she would never have consented to allow the girls to keep an\nanimal and a bath of sand under their bed.\n\nWhen breakfast had been cleared away--it was a very nice breakfast with\nhot rolls to it, a luxury quite out of the common way--Anthea went and\ndragged out the bath, and woke the Psammead.\n\nIt stretched and shook itself.\n\n‘You must have bolted your breakfast most unwholesomely,’ it said, ‘you\ncan’t have been five minutes over it.’\n\n‘We’ve been nearly an hour,’ said Anthea. ‘Come--you know you promised.’\n\n‘Now look here,’ said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand and\nshooting out its long eyes suddenly, ‘we’d better begin as we mean to\ngo on. It won’t do to have any misunderstanding, so I tell you plainly\nthat--’\n\n‘Oh, PLEASE,’ Anthea pleaded, ‘do wait till we get to the others.\nThey’ll think it most awfully sneakish of me to talk to you without\nthem; do come down, there’s a dear.’\n\nShe knelt before the sand-bath and held out her arms. The Psammead must\nhave remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same little arms\nonly the day before, for it gave a little grudging grunt, and jumped\nonce more.\n\nAnthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs. It was\nwelcomed in a thrilling silence. At last Anthea said, ‘Now then!’\n\n‘What place is this?’ asked the Psammead, shooting its eyes out and\nturning them slowly round.\n\n‘It’s a sitting-room, of course,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Then I don’t like it,’ said the Psammead.\n\n‘Never mind,’ said Anthea kindly; ‘we’ll take you anywhere you like if\nyou want us to. What was it you were going to say upstairs when I said\nthe others wouldn’t like it if I stayed talking to you without them?’\n\nIt looked keenly at her, and she blushed.\n\n‘Don’t be silly,’ it said sharply. ‘Of course, it’s quite natural that\nyou should like your brothers and sisters to know exactly how good and\nunselfish you were.’\n\n‘I wish you wouldn’t,’ said Jane. ‘Anthea was quite right. What was it\nyou were going to say when she stopped you?’\n\n‘I’ll tell you,’ said the Psammead, ‘since you’re so anxious to know. I\nwas going to say this. You’ve saved my life--and I’m not ungrateful--but\nit doesn’t change your nature or mine. You’re still very ignorant, and\nrather silly, and I am worth a thousand of you any day of the week.’\n\n‘Of course you are!’ Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her.\n\n‘It’s very rude to interrupt,’ it said; ‘what I mean is that I’m not\ngoing to stand any nonsense, and if you think what you’ve done is to\ngive you the right to pet me or make me demean myself by playing with\nyou, you’ll find out that what you think doesn’t matter a single penny.\nSee? It’s what _I_ think that matters.’\n\n‘I know,’ said Cyril, ‘it always was, if you remember.’\n\n‘Well,’ said the Psammead, ‘then that’s settled. We’re to be treated as\nwe deserve. I with respect, and all of you with--but I don’t wish to be\noffensive. Do you want me to tell you how I got into that horrible den\nyou bought me out of? Oh, I’m not ungrateful! I haven’t forgotten it and\nI shan’t forget it.’\n\n‘Do tell us,’ said Anthea. ‘I know you’re awfully clever, but even with\nall your cleverness, I don’t believe you can possibly know how--how\nrespectfully we do respect you. Don’t we?’\n\nThe others all said yes--and fidgeted in their chairs. Robert spoke the\nwishes of all when he said--\n\n‘I do wish you’d go on.’ So it sat up on the green-covered table and\nwent on.\n\n‘When you’d gone away,’ it said, ‘I went to sand for a bit, and slept. I\nwas tired out with all your silly wishes, and I felt as though I hadn’t\nreally been to sand for a year.’\n\n‘To sand?’ Jane repeated.\n\n‘Where I sleep. You go to bed. I go to sand.’\n\nJane yawned; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy.\n\n‘All right,’ said the Psammead, in offended tones. ‘I’m sure _I_ don’t\nwant to tell you a long tale. A man caught me, and I bit him. And he put\nme in a bag with a dead hare and a dead rabbit. And he took me to his\nhouse and put me out of the bag into a basket with holes that I could\nsee through. And I bit him again. And then he brought me to this city,\nwhich I am told is called the Modern Babylon--though it’s not a bit like\nthe old Babylon--and he sold me to the man you bought me from, and then\nI bit them both. Now, what’s your news?’\n\n‘There’s not quite so much biting in our story,’ said Cyril regretfully;\n‘in fact, there isn’t any. Father’s gone to Manchuria, and Mother and\nThe Lamb have gone to Madeira because Mother was ill, and don’t I just\nwish that they were both safe home again.’\n\nMerely from habit, the Sand-fairy began to blow itself out, but it\nstopped short suddenly.\n\n‘I forgot,’ it said; ‘I can’t give you any more wishes.’\n\n‘No--but look here,’ said Cyril, ‘couldn’t we call in old Nurse and get\nher to say SHE wishes they were safe home. I’m sure she does.’\n\n‘No go,’ said the Psammead. ‘It’s just the same as your wishing yourself\nif you get some one else to wish for you. It won’t act.’\n\n‘But it did yesterday--with the man in the shop,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Ah yes,’ said the creature, ‘but you didn’t ASK him to wish, and you\ndidn’t know what would happen if he did. That can’t be done again. It’s\nplayed out.’\n\n‘Then you can’t help us at all,’ said Jane; ‘oh--I did think you could\ndo something; I’ve been thinking about it ever since we saved your life\nyesterday. I thought you’d be certain to be able to fetch back Father,\neven if you couldn’t manage Mother.’\n\nAnd Jane began to cry.\n\n‘Now DON’T,’ said the Psammead hastily; ‘you know how it always upsets\nme if you cry. I can’t feel safe a moment. Look here; you must have some\nnew kind of charm.’\n\n‘That’s easier said than done.’\n\n‘Not a bit of it,’ said the creature; ‘there’s one of the strongest\ncharms in the world not a stone’s throw from where you bought me\nyesterday. The man that I bit so--the first one, I mean--went into\na shop to ask how much something cost--I think he said it was a\nconcertina--and while he was telling the man in the shop how much too\nmuch he wanted for it, I saw the charm in a sort of tray, with a lot of\nother things. If you can only buy THAT, you will be able to have your\nheart’s desire.’\n\nThe children looked at each other and then at the Psammead. Then Cyril\ncoughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was\nthinking.\n\n‘I do hope you won’t be waxy,’ he said; ‘but it’s like this: when you\nused to give us our wishes they almost always got us into some row\nor other, and we used to think you wouldn’t have been pleased if they\nhadn’t. Now, about this charm--we haven’t got over and above too much\ntin, and if we blue it all on this charm and it turns out to be not up\nto much--well--you see what I’m driving at, don’t you?’\n\n‘I see that YOU don’t see more than the length of your nose, and THAT’S\nnot far,’ said the Psammead crossly. ‘Look here, I HAD to give you the\nwishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a sort of way, because\nyou hadn’t the sense to wish for what was good for you. But this charm’s\nquite different. I haven’t GOT to do this for you, it’s just my own\ngenerous kindness that makes me tell you about it. So it’s bound to be\nall right. See?’\n\n‘Don’t be cross,’ said Anthea, ‘Please, PLEASE don’t. You see, it’s\nall we’ve got; we shan’t have any more pocket-money till Daddy comes\nhome--unless he sends us some in a letter. But we DO trust you. And I\nsay all of you,’ she went on, ‘don’t you think it’s worth spending ALL\nthe money, if there’s even the chanciest chance of getting Father and\nMother back safe NOW? Just think of it! Oh, do let’s!’\n\n‘_I_ don’t care what you do,’ said the Psammead; ‘I’ll go back to sand\nagain till you’ve made up your minds.’\n\n‘No, don’t!’ said everybody; and Jane added, ‘We are quite mind\nmade-up--don’t you see we are? Let’s get our hats. Will you come with\nus?’\n\n‘Of course,’ said the Psammead; ‘how else would you find the shop?’\n\nSo everybody got its hat. The Psammead was put into a flat bass-bag that\nhad come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of filleted plaice in\nit. Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of solid Psammead,\nand the children took it in turns to carry it.\n\n‘It’s not half the weight of The Lamb,’ Robert said, and the girls\nsighed.\n\nThe Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every now and\nthen, and told the children which turnings to take.\n\n‘How on earth do you know?’ asked Robert. ‘I can’t think how you do it.’\n\nAnd the Psammead said sharply, ‘No--I don’t suppose you can.’\n\nAt last they came to THE shop. It had all sorts and kinds of things\nin the window--concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china vases and\ntea-cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols, lace collars,\nsilver spoons tied up in half-dozens, and wedding-rings in a red\nlacquered basin. There were officers’ epaulets and doctors’ lancets.\nThere were tea-caddies inlaid with red turtle-shell and brass\ncurly-wurlies, plates of different kinds of money, and stacks of\ndifferent kinds of plates. There was a beautiful picture of a little\ngirl washing a dog, which Jane liked very much. And in the middle of\nthe window there was a dirty silver tray full of mother-of-pearl card\ncounters, old seals, paste buckles, snuff-boxes, and all sorts of little\ndingy odds and ends.\n\nThe Psammead put its head quite out of the fish-basket to look in the\nwindow, when Cyril said--\n\n‘There’s a tray there with rubbish in it.’\n\nAnd then its long snail’s eyes saw something that made them stretch out\nso much that they were as long and thin as new slate-pencils. Its fur\nbristled thickly, and its voice was quite hoarse with excitement as it\nwhispered--\n\n‘That’s it! That’s it! There, under that blue and yellow buckle, you can\nsee a bit sticking out. It’s red. Do you see?’\n\n‘Is it that thing something like a horse-shoe?’ asked Cyril. ‘And red,\nlike the common sealing-wax you do up parcels with?’ ‘Yes, that’s it,’\nsaid the Psammead. ‘Now, you do just as you did before. Ask the price of\nother things. That blue buckle would do. Then the man will get the tray\nout of the window. I think you’d better be the one,’ it said to Anthea.\n‘We’ll wait out here.’\n\nSo the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and\npresently a large, dirty, short-fingered hand with a very big diamond\nring came stretching through the green half-curtains at the back of the\nshop window and took away the tray.\n\nThey could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea\nand the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had had time--if\nshe had had money--to buy everything in the shop before the moment came\nwhen she stood before them, her face wreathed in grins, as Cyril said\nlater, and in her hand the charm.\n\nIt was something like this: [Drawing omitted.] and it was made of a red,\nsmooth, softly shiny stone.\n\n‘I’ve got it,’ Anthea whispered, just opening her hand to give the\nothers a glimpse of it. ‘Do let’s get home. We can’t stand here like\nstuck-pigs looking at it in the street.’\n\nSo home they went. The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat\nbackground to magic happenings. Down in the country among the flowers\nand green fields anything had seemed--and indeed had been--possible. But\nit was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so\nnear the Tottenham Court Road. But the Psammead was there--and it in\nitself was wonderful. And it could talk--and it had shown them where a\ncharm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy.\nSo the four children hurried home, taking very long steps, with their\nchins stuck out, and their mouths shut very tight indeed. They went so\nfast that the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish-bag, but it\ndid not say anything--perhaps for fear of attracting public notice.\n\nThey got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on the\ngreen tablecloth.\n\n‘Now then!’ said Cyril.\n\nBut the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for it was\nquite faint. When it had refreshed itself a little it said--\n\n‘Now then! Let me see the charm,’ and Anthea laid it on the green\ntable-cover. The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at it, then it\nturned them reproachfully on Anthea and said--\n\n‘But there’s only half of it here!’\n\nThis was indeed a blow.\n\n‘It was all there was,’ said Anthea, with timid firmness. She knew it\nwas not her fault. ‘There should be another piece,’ said the Psammead,\n‘and a sort of pin to fasten the two together.’\n\n‘Isn’t half any good?’--‘Won’t it work without the other bit?’--‘It cost\nseven-and-six.’--‘Oh, bother, bother, bother!’--‘Don’t be silly little\nidiots!’ said everyone and the Psammead altogether.\n\nThen there was a wretched silence. Cyril broke it--\n\n‘What shall we do?’\n\n‘Go back to the shop and see if they haven’t got the other half,’ said\nthe Psammead. ‘I’ll go to sand till you come back. Cheer up! Even the\nbit you’ve got is SOME good, but it’ll be no end of a bother if you\ncan’t find the other.’\n\nSo Cyril went to the shop. And the Psammead to sand. And the other three\nwent to dinner, which was now ready. And old Nurse was very cross that\nCyril was not ready too.\n\nThe three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and even\nbefore he was near enough for them to see his face there was something\nabout the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and\nthe way he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his\nerrand had been in vain.\n\n‘Well?’ they all said, hoping against hope on the front-door step.\n\n‘No go,’ Cyril answered; ‘the man said the thing was perfect. He said\nit was a Roman lady’s locket, and people shouldn’t buy curios if they\ndidn’t know anything about arky--something or other, and that he never\nwent back on a bargain, because it wasn’t business, and he expected his\ncustomers to act the same. He was simply nasty--that’s what he was, and\nI want my dinner.’\n\nIt was plain that Cyril was not pleased.\n\nThe unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that\nparlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone’s spirits. Cyril had his\ndinner, and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of apple-pudding\nthere was a scratch at the door. Anthea opened it and in walked the\nPsammead.\n\n‘Well,’ it said, when it had heard the news, ‘things might be worse.\nOnly you won’t be surprised if you have a few adventures before you get\nthe other half. You want to get it, of course.’\n\n‘Rather,’ was the general reply. ‘And we don’t mind adventures.’\n\n‘No,’ said the Psammead, ‘I seem to remember that about you. Well, sit\ndown and listen with all your ears. Eight, are there? Right--I am glad\nyou know arithmetic. Now pay attention, because I don’t intend to tell\nyou everything twice over.’\n\nAs the children settled themselves on the floor--it was far more\ncomfortable than the chairs, as well as more polite to the Psammead, who\nwas stroking its whiskers on the hearth-rug--a sudden cold pain caught\nat Anthea’s heart. Father--Mother--the darling Lamb--all far away. Then\na warm, comfortable feeling flowed through her. The Psammead was here,\nand at least half a charm, and there were to be adventures. (If you\ndon’t know what a cold pain is, I am glad for your sakes, and I hope you\nnever may.)\n\n‘Now,’ said the Psammead cheerily, ‘you are not particularly nice, nor\nparticularly clever, and you’re not at all good-looking. Still, you’ve\nsaved my life--oh, when I think of that man and his pail of water!--so\nI’ll tell you all I know. At least, of course I can’t do that, because I\nknow far too much. But I’ll tell you all I know about this red thing.’\n\n‘Do! Do! Do! Do!’ said everyone.\n\n‘Well, then,’ said the Psammead. ‘This thing is half of an Amulet that\ncan do all sorts of things; it can make the corn grow, and the waters\nflow, and the trees bear fruit, and the little new beautiful babies\ncome. (Not that babies ARE beautiful, of course,’ it broke off to say,\n‘but their mothers think they are--and as long as you think a thing’s\ntrue it IS true as far as you’re concerned.)’\n\nRobert yawned.\n\nThe Psammead went on.\n\n‘The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make people\nunhappy--jealousy, bad temper, pride, disagreeableness, greediness,\nselfishness, laziness. Evil spirits, people called them when the Amulet\nwas made. Don’t you think it would be nice to have it?’\n\n‘Very,’ said the children, quite without enthusiasm.\n\n‘And it can give you strength and courage.’\n\n‘That’s better,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘And virtue.’\n\n‘I suppose it’s nice to have that,’ said Jane, but not with much\ninterest.\n\n‘And it can give you your heart’s desire.’\n\n‘Now you’re talking,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Of course I am,’ retorted the Psammead tartly, ‘so there’s no need for\nyou to.’\n\n‘Heart’s desire is good enough for me,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Yes, but,’ Anthea ventured, ‘all that’s what the WHOLE charm can do.\nThere’s something that the half we’ve got can win off its own bat--isn’t\nthere?’ She appealed to the Psammead. It nodded.\n\n‘Yes,’ it said; ‘the half has the power to take you anywhere you like to\nlook for the other half.’\n\nThis seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked--\n\n‘Does it know where to look?’\n\nThe Psammead shook its head and answered, ‘I don’t think it’s likely.’\n\n‘Do you?’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘Then,’ said Robert, ‘we might as well look for a needle in a bottle of\nhay. Yes--it IS bottle, and not bundle, Father said so.’\n\n‘Not at all,’ said the Psammead briskly-, ‘you think you know\neverything, but you are quite mistaken. The first thing is to get the\nthing to talk.’\n\n‘Can it?’ Jane questioned. Jane’s question did not mean that she thought\nit couldn’t, for in spite of the parlour furniture the feeling of magic\nwas growing deeper and thicker, and seemed to fill the room like a dream\nof a scented fog.\n\n‘Of course it can. I suppose you can read.’\n\n‘Oh yes!’ Everyone was rather hurt at the question.\n\n‘Well, then--all you’ve got to do is to read the name that’s written on\nthe part of the charm that you’ve got. And as soon as you say the name\nout loud the thing will have power to do--well, several things.’\n\nThere was a silence. The red charm was passed from hand to hand.\n\n‘There’s no name on it,’ said Cyril at last.\n\n‘Nonsense,’ said the Psammead; ‘what’s that?’\n\n‘Oh, THAT!’ said Cyril, ‘it’s not reading. It looks like pictures of\nchickens and snakes and things.’\n\nThis was what was on the charm: [Hieroglyphics omitted.]\n\n‘I’ve no patience with you,’ said the Psammead; ‘if you can’t read you\nmust find some one who can. A priest now?’\n\n‘We don’t know any priests,’ said Anthea; ‘we know a clergyman--he’s\ncalled a priest in the prayer-book, you know--but he only knows Greek\nand Latin and Hebrew, and this isn’t any of those--I know.’\n\nThe Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily.\n\n‘I wish I’d never seen you,’ it said; ‘you aren’t any more good than so\nmany stone images. Not so much, if I’m to tell the truth. Is there no\nwise man in your Babylon who can pronounce the names of the Great Ones?’\n\n‘There’s a poor learned gentleman upstairs,’ said Anthea, ‘we might try\nhim. He has a lot of stone images in his room, and iron-looking ones\ntoo--we peeped in once when he was out. Old Nurse says he doesn’t eat\nenough to keep a canary alive. He spends it all on stones and things.’\n\n‘Try him,’ said the Psammead, ‘only be careful. If he knows a greater\nname than this and uses it against you, your charm will be of no use.\nBind him first with the chains of honour and upright dealing. And then\nask his aid--oh, yes, you’d better all go; you can put me to sand as you\ngo upstairs. I must have a few minutes’ peace and quietness.’\n\nSo the four children hastily washed their hands and brushed their\nhair--this was Anthea’s idea--and went up to knock at the door of the\n‘poor learned gentleman’, and to ‘bind him with the chains of honour and\nupright dealing’.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE PAST\n\nThe learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold. It was mutton\nchop, and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in the\nmiddle of a frozen pond, because the grease of the gravy had become\ncold, and consequently white. It looked very nasty, and it was the first\nthing the children saw when, after knocking three times and receiving\nno reply, one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly to open the\ndoor. The chop was on the end of a long table that ran down one side of\nthe room. The table had images on it and queer-shaped stones, and books.\nAnd there were glass cases fixed against the wall behind, with little\nstrange things in them. The cases were rather like the ones you see in\njewellers’ shops.\n\nThe ‘poor learned gentleman’ was sitting at a table in the window,\nlooking at something very small which he held in a pair of fine pincers.\nHe had a round spy-glass sort of thing in one eye--which reminded\nthe children of watchmakers, and also of the long snail’s eyes of the\nPsammead. The gentleman was very long and thin, and his long, thin boots\nstuck out under the other side of his table. He did not hear the door\nopen, and the children stood hesitating. At last Robert gave the door a\npush, and they all started back, for in the middle of the wall that the\ndoor had hidden was a mummy-case--very, very, very big--painted in red\nand yellow and green and black, and the face of it seemed to look at\nthem quite angrily.\n\nYou know what a mummy-case is like, of course? If you don’t you had\nbetter go to the British Museum at once and find out. Anyway, it is not\nat all the sort of thing that you expect to meet in a top-floor front\nin Bloomsbury, looking as though it would like to know what business YOU\nhad there.\n\nSo everyone said, ‘Oh!’ rather loud, and their boots clattered as they\nstumbled back.\n\nThe learned gentleman took the glass out of his eye and said--‘I beg\nyour pardon,’ in a very soft, quiet pleasant voice--the voice of a\ngentleman who has been to Oxford.\n\n‘It’s us that beg yours,’ said Cyril politely. ‘We are sorry to disturb\nyou.’\n\n‘Come in,’ said the gentleman, rising--with the most distinguished\ncourtesy, Anthea told herself. ‘I am delighted to see you. Won’t you sit\ndown? No, not there; allow me to move that papyrus.’\n\nHe cleared a chair, and stood smiling and looking kindly through his\nlarge, round spectacles.\n\n‘He treats us like grown-ups,’ whispered Robert, ‘and he doesn’t seem to\nknow how many of us there are.’\n\n‘Hush,’ said Anthea, ‘it isn’t manners to whisper. You say, Cyril--go\nahead.’\n\n‘We’re very sorry to disturb you,’ said Cyril politely, ‘but we did\nknock three times, and you didn’t say “Come in”, or “Run away now”, or\nthat you couldn’t be bothered just now, or to come when you weren’t so\nbusy, or any of the things people do say when you knock at doors, so we\nopened it. We knew you were in because we heard you sneeze while we were\nwaiting.’\n\n‘Not at all,’ said the gentleman; ‘do sit down.’\n\n‘He has found out there are four of us,’ said Robert, as the gentleman\ncleared three more chairs. He put the things off them carefully on the\nfloor. The first chair had things like bricks that tiny, tiny birds’\nfeet have walked over when the bricks were soft, only the marks were in\nregular lines. The second chair had round things on it like very large,\nfat, long, pale beads. And the last chair had a pile of dusty papers on\nit. The children sat down.\n\n‘We know you are very, very learned,’ said Cyril, ‘and we have got a\ncharm, and we want you to read the name on it, because it isn’t in Latin\nor Greek, or Hebrew, or any of the languages WE know--’\n\n‘A thorough knowledge of even those languages is a very fair foundation\non which to build an education,’ said the gentleman politely.\n\n‘Oh!’ said Cyril blushing, ‘but we only know them to look at, except\nLatin--and I’m only in Caesar with that.’ The gentleman took off his\nspectacles and laughed. His laugh sounded rusty, Cyril thought, as\nthough it wasn’t often used.\n\n‘Of course!’ he said. ‘I’m sure I beg your pardon. I think I must have\nbeen in a dream. You are the children who live downstairs, are you not?\nYes. I have seen you as I have passed in and out. And you have found\nsomething that you think to be an antiquity, and you’ve brought it to\nshow me? That was very kind. I should like to inspect it.’\n\n‘I’m afraid we didn’t think about your liking to inspect it,’ said the\ntruthful Anthea. ‘It was just for US because we wanted to know the name\non it--’\n\n‘Oh, yes--and, I say,’ Robert interjected, ‘you won’t think it rude\nof us if we ask you first, before we show it, to be bound in the\nwhat-do-you-call-it of--’\n\n‘In the bonds of honour and upright dealing,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘I’m afraid I don’t quite follow you,’ said the gentleman, with gentle\nnervousness.\n\n‘Well, it’s this way,’ said Cyril. ‘We’ve got part of a charm. And the\nSammy--I mean, something told us it would work, though it’s only half a\none; but it won’t work unless we can say the name that’s on it. But, of\ncourse, if you’ve got another name that can lick ours, our charm will\nbe no go; so we want you to give us your word of honour as a\ngentleman--though I’m sure, now I’ve seen you, that it’s not necessary;\nbut still I’ve promised to ask you, so we must. Will you please give us\nyour honourable word not to say any name stronger than the name on our\ncharm?’\n\nThe gentleman had put on his spectacles again and was looking at Cyril\nthrough them. He now said: ‘Bless me!’ more than once, adding, ‘Who told\nyou all this?’\n\n‘I can’t tell you,’ said Cyril. ‘I’m very sorry, but I can’t.’\n\nSome faint memory of a far-off childhood must have come to the learned\ngentleman just then, for he smiled. ‘I see,’ he said. ‘It is some sort\nof game that you are engaged in? Of course! Yes! Well, I will certainly\npromise. Yet I wonder how you heard of the names of power?’\n\n‘We can’t tell you that either,’ said Cyril; and Anthea said, ‘Here is\nour charm,’ and held it out.\n\nWith politeness, but without interest, the gentleman took it. But after\nthe first glance all his body suddenly stiffened, as a pointer’s does\nwhen he sees a partridge.\n\n‘Excuse me,’ he said in quite a changed voice, and carried the charm to\nthe window. He looked at it; he turned it over. He fixed his spy-glass\nin his eye and looked again. No one said anything. Only Robert made a\nshuffling noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up. At last\nthe learned gentleman drew a long breath.\n\n‘Where did you find this?’ he asked.\n\n‘We didn’t find it. We bought it at a shop. Jacob Absalom the name\nis--not far from Charing Cross,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘We gave seven-and-sixpence for it,’ added Jane.\n\n‘It is not for sale, I suppose? You do not wish to part with it?\n\nI ought to tell you that it is extremely valuable--extraordinarily\nvaluable, I may say.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘we know that, so of course we want to keep it.’\n\n‘Keep it carefully, then,’ said the gentleman impressively; ‘and if ever\nyou should wish to part with it, may I ask you to give me the refusal of\nit?’\n\n‘The refusal?’\n\n‘I mean, do not sell it to anyone else until you have given me the\nopportunity of buying it.’\n\n‘All right,’ said Cyril, ‘we won’t. But we don’t want to sell it. We\nwant to make it do things.’\n\n‘I suppose you can play at that as well as at anything else,’ said the\ngentleman; ‘but I’m afraid the days of magic are over.’\n\n‘They aren’t REALLY,’ said Anthea earnestly. ‘You’d see they aren’t if I\ncould tell you about our last summer holidays. Only I mustn’t. Thank you\nvery much. And can you read the name?’\n\n‘Yes, I can read it.’\n\n‘Will you tell it us?’ ‘The name,’ said the gentleman, ‘is Ur Hekau\nSetcheh.’\n\n‘Ur Hekau Setcheh,’ repeated Cyril. ‘Thanks awfully. I do hope we\nhaven’t taken up too much of your time.’\n\n‘Not at all,’ said the gentleman. ‘And do let me entreat you to be very,\nvery careful of that most valuable specimen.’\n\nThey said ‘Thank you’ in all the different polite ways they could think\nof, and filed out of the door and down the stairs. Anthea was last.\nHalf-way down to the first landing she turned and ran up again.\n\nThe door was still open, and the learned gentleman and the mummy-case\nwere standing opposite to each other, and both looked as though they had\nstood like that for years.\n\nThe gentleman started when Anthea put her hand on his arm.\n\n‘I hope you won’t be cross and say it’s not my business,’ she said,\n‘but do look at your chop! Don’t you think you ought to eat it? Father\nforgets his dinner sometimes when he’s writing, and Mother always says I\nought to remind him if she’s not at home to do it herself, because it’s\nso bad to miss your regular meals.\n\nSo I thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind my reminding you, because you\ndon’t seem to have anyone else to do it.’\n\nShe glanced at the mummy-case; IT certainly did not look as though it\nwould ever think of reminding people of their meals.\n\nThe learned gentleman looked at her for a moment before he said--\n\n‘Thank you, my dear. It was a kindly thought. No, I haven’t anyone to\nremind me about things like that.’\n\nHe sighed, and looked at the chop.\n\n‘It looks very nasty,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said, ‘it does. I’ll eat it immediately, before I forget.’\n\nAs he ate it he sighed more than once. Perhaps because the chop was\nnasty, perhaps because he longed for the charm which the children did\nnot want to sell, perhaps because it was so long since anyone cared\nwhether he ate his chops or forgot them.\n\nAnthea caught the others at the stair-foot. They woke the Psammead, and\nit taught them exactly how to use the word of power, and to make the\ncharm speak. I am not going to tell you how this is done, because you\nmight try to do it. And for you any such trying would be almost sure\nto end in disappointment. Because in the first place it is a thousand\nmillion to one against your ever getting hold of the right sort of\ncharm, and if you did, there would be hardly any chance at all of your\nfinding a learned gentleman clever enough and kind enough to read the\nword for you.\n\nThe children and the Psammead crouched in a circle on the floor--in the\ngirls’ bedroom, because in the parlour they might have been interrupted\nby old Nurse’s coming in to lay the cloth for tea--and the charm was put\nin the middle of the circle.\n\nThe sun shone splendidly outside, and the room was very light. Through\nthe open window came the hum and rattle of London, and in the street\nbelow they could hear the voice of the milkman.\n\nWhen all was ready, the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word. And\nshe said it. Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go\nout. The room was dark. The world outside was dark--darker than the\ndarkest night that ever was. And all the sounds went out too, so that\nthere was a silence deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed\nof imagining. It was like being suddenly deaf and blind, only darker and\nquieter even than that.\n\nBut before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to be\nfrightened, a faint, beautiful light began to show in the middle of the\ncircle, and at the same moment a faint, beautiful voice began to speak.\nThe light was too small for one to see anything by, and the voice was\ntoo small for you to hear what it said. You could just see the light and\njust hear the voice.\n\nBut the light grew stronger. It was greeny, like glow-worms’ lamps,\nand it grew and grew till it was as though thousands and thousands of\nglow-worms were signalling to their winged sweethearts from the middle\nof the circle. And the voice grew, not so much in loudness as in\nsweetness (though it grew louder, too), till it was so sweet that\nyou wanted to cry with pleasure just at the sound of it. It was like\nnightingales, and the sea, and the fiddle, and the voice of your mother\nwhen you have been a long time away, and she meets you at the door when\nyou get home.\n\nAnd the voice said--\n\n‘Speak. What is it that you would hear?’\n\nI cannot tell you what language the voice used. I only know that\neveryone present understood it perfectly. If you come to think of it,\nthere must be some language that everyone could understand, if we only\nknew what it was. Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke, nor whether\nit was the charm that spoke, or some presence in the charm. The children\ncould not have told you either. Indeed, they could not look at the charm\nwhile it was speaking, because the light was too bright. They looked\ninstead at the green radiance on the faded Kidderminster carpet at the\nedge of the circle. They all felt very quiet, and not inclined to ask\nquestions or fidget with their feet. For this was not like the things\nthat had happened in the country when the Psammead had given them their\nwishes. That had been funny somehow, and this was not. It was something\nlike Arabian Nights magic, and something like being in church. No one\ncared to speak.\n\nIt was Cyril who said at last--\n\n‘Please we want to know where the other half of the charm is.’\n\n‘The part of the Amulet which is lost,’ said the beautiful voice, ‘was\nbroken and ground into the dust of the shrine that held it. It and the\npin that joined the two halves are themselves dust, and the dust is\nscattered over many lands and sunk in many seas.’\n\n‘Oh, I say!’ murmured Robert, and a blank silence fell. ‘Then it’s all\nup?’ said Cyril at last; ‘it’s no use our looking for a thing that’s\nsmashed into dust, and the dust scattered all over the place.’\n\n‘If you would find it,’ said the voice, ‘You must seek it where it still\nis, perfect as ever.’\n\n‘I don’t understand,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘In the Past you may find it,’ said the voice.\n\n‘I wish we MAY find it,’ said Cyril.\n\nThe Psammead whispered crossly, ‘Don’t you understand? The thing existed\nin the Past. If you were in the Past, too, you could find it. It’s very\ndifficult to make you understand things. Time and space are only forms\nof thought.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘No, you don’t,’ said the Psammead, ‘and it doesn’t matter if you don’t,\neither. What I mean is that if you were only made the right way, you\ncould see everything happening in the same place at the same time. Now\ndo you see?’\n\n‘I’m afraid _I_ don’t,’ said Anthea; ‘I’m sorry I’m so stupid.’\n\n‘Well, at any rate, you see this. That lost half of the Amulet is in the\nPast. Therefore it’s in the Past we must look for it. I mustn’t speak to\nthe charm myself. Ask it things! Find out!’\n\n‘Where can we find the other part of you?’ asked Cyril obediently.\n\n‘In the Past,’ said the voice.\n\n‘What part of the Past?’\n\n‘I may not tell you. If you will choose a time, I will take you to the\nplace that then held it. You yourselves must find it.’\n\n‘When did you see it last?’ asked Anthea--‘I mean, when was it taken\naway from you?’\n\nThe beautiful voice answered--\n\n‘That was thousands of years ago. The Amulet was perfect then, and lay\nin a shrine, the last of many shrines, and I worked wonders. Then came\nstrange men with strange weapons and destroyed my shrine, and the Amulet\nthey bore away with many captives. But of these, one, my priest, knew\nthe word of power, and spoke it for me, so that the Amulet became\ninvisible, and thus returned to my shrine, but the shrine was broken\ndown, and ere any magic could rebuild it one spoke a word before which\nmy power bowed down and was still. And the Amulet lay there, still\nperfect, but enslaved. Then one coming with stones to rebuild the\nshrine, dropped a hewn stone on the Amulet as it lay, and one half was\nsundered from the other. I had no power to seek for that which was lost.\nAnd there being none to speak the word of power, I could not rejoin it.\nSo the Amulet lay in the dust of the desert many thousand years, and at\nlast came a small man, a conqueror with an army, and after him a crowd\nof men who sought to seem wise, and one of these found half the Amulet\nand brought it to this land. But none could read the name. So I lay\nstill. And this man dying and his son after him, the Amulet was sold by\nthose who came after to a merchant, and from him you bought it, and it\nis here, and now, the name of power having been spoken, I also am here.’\n\nThis is what the voice said. I think it must have meant Napoleon by the\nsmall man, the conqueror. Because I know I have been told that he took\nan army to Egypt, and that afterwards a lot of wise people went grubbing\nin the sand, and fished up all sorts of wonderful things, older than\nyou would think possible. And of these I believe this charm to have been\none, and the most wonderful one of all.\n\nEveryone listened: and everyone tried to think. It is not easy to do\nthis clearly when you have been listening to the kind of talk I have\ntold you about.\n\nAt last Robert said--\n\n‘Can you take us into the Past--to the shrine where you and the other\nthing were together. If you could take us there, we might find the other\npart still there after all these thousands of years.’\n\n‘Still there? silly!’ said Cyril. ‘Don’t you see, if we go back into the\nPast it won’t be thousands of years ago. It will be NOW for us--won’t\nit?’ He appealed to the Psammead, who said--\n\n‘You’re not so far off the idea as you usually are!’\n\n‘Well,’ said Anthea, ‘will you take us back to when there was a shrine\nand you were safe in it--all of you?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said the voice. ‘You must hold me up, and speak the word of\npower, and one by one, beginning with the first-born, you shall pass\nthrough me into the Past. But let the last that passes be the one that\nholds me, and let him not lose his hold, lest you lose me, and so remain\nin the Past for ever.’\n\n‘That’s a nasty idea,’ said Robert.\n\n‘When you desire to return,’ the beautiful voice went on, ‘hold me up\ntowards the East, and speak the word. Then, passing through me, you\nshall return to this time and it shall be the present to you.’\n\n‘But how--’ A bell rang loudly.\n\n‘Oh crikey!’ exclaimed Robert, ‘that’s tea! Will you please make it\nproper daylight again so that we can go down. And thank you so much for\nall your kindness.’\n\n‘We’ve enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you!’ added Anthea\npolitely.\n\nThe beautiful light faded slowly. The great darkness and silence came\nand these suddenly changed to the dazzlement of day and the great soft,\nrustling sound of London, that is like some vast beast turning over in\nits sleep.\n\nThe children rubbed their eyes, the Psammead ran quickly to its sandy\nbath, and the others went down to tea. And until the cups were actually\nfilled tea seemed less real than the beautiful voice and the greeny\nlight.\n\nAfter tea Anthea persuaded the others to allow her to hang the charm\nround her neck with a piece of string.\n\n‘It would be so awful if it got lost,’ she said: ‘it might get lost\nanywhere, you know, and it would be rather beastly for us to have to\nstay in the Past for ever and ever, wouldn’t it?’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO\n\nNext morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the ‘poor\nlearned gentleman’s’ breakfast. He did not recognize her at first, but\nwhen he did he was vaguely pleased to see her.\n\n‘You see I’m wearing the charm round my neck,’ she said; ‘I’m taking\ncare of it--like you told us to.’\n\n‘That’s right,’ said he; ‘did you have a good game last night?’\n\n‘You will eat your breakfast before it’s cold, won’t you?’ said Anthea.\n‘Yes, we had a splendid time. The charm made it all dark, and then\ngreeny light, and then it spoke. Oh! I wish you could have heard it--it\nwas such a darling voice--and it told us the other half of it was lost\nin the Past, so of course we shall have to look for it there!’\n\nThe learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked\nanxiously at Anthea.\n\n‘I suppose it’s natural--youthful imagination and so forth,’ he said.\n‘Yet someone must have... Who told you that some part of the charm was\nmissing?’\n\n‘I can’t tell you,’ she said. ‘I know it seems most awfully rude,\nespecially after being so kind about telling us the name of power, and\nall that, but really, I’m not allowed to tell anybody anything about\nthe--the--the person who told me. You won’t forget your breakfast, will\nyou?’\n\nThe learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned--not a cross-frown,\nbut a puzzle-frown.\n\n‘Thank you,’ he said, ‘I shall always be pleased if you’ll look in--any\ntime you’re passing you know--at least...’\n\n‘I will,’ she said; ‘goodbye. I’ll always tell you anything I MAY tell.’\n\nHe had not had many adventures with children in them, and he wondered\nwhether all children were like these. He spent quite five minutes in\nwondering before he settled down to the fifty-second chapter of his\ngreat book on ‘The Secret Rites of the Priests of Amen Ra’.\n\n\nIt is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of\nagitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past. That\nidea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back again,\nwas anything but pleasing. Yet no one would have dared to suggest that\nthe charm should not be used; and though each was in its heart very\nfrightened indeed, they would all have joined in jeering at the\ncowardice of any one of them who should have uttered the timid but\nnatural suggestion, ‘Don’t let’s!’\n\nIt seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day, for\nthere was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner-bell would\nbe able to reach back into the Past, and it seemed unwise to excite old\nNurse’s curiosity when nothing they could say--not even the truth--could\nin any way satisfy it. They were all very proud to think how well they\nhad understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and\nSpace and things like that, and they were perfectly certain that it\nwould be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word\nof it. So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into\nRegent’s Park--and this, with the implied cold mutton and tomatoes, was\nreadily granted.\n\n‘You can get yourselves some buns or sponge-cakes, or whatever you\nfancy-like,’ said old Nurse, giving Cyril a shilling. ‘Don’t go getting\njam-tarts, now--so messy at the best of times, and without forks and\nplates ruination to your clothes, besides your not being able to wash\nyour hands and faces afterwards.’\n\nSo Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off. They went round\nby the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof sheeting to put\nover the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past when they got\nthere. For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get wet.\n\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. Women\nwere selling roses from big baskets-full, and Anthea bought four roses,\none each, for herself and the others. They were red roses and smelt\nof summer--the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about\nChristmas-time when you can only get mistletoe, which is pale right\nthrough to its very scent, and holly which pricks your nose if you try\nto smell it. So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon\neveryone was sitting on the grass in Regent’s Park under trees whose\nleaves would have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were\ndusty and yellowish, and brown at the edges.\n\n‘We’ve got to go on with it,’ said Anthea, ‘and as the eldest has to go\nfirst, you’ll have to be last, Jane. You quite understand about holding\non to the charm as you go through, don’t you, Pussy?’\n\n‘I wish I hadn’t got to be last,’ said Jane.\n\n‘You shall carry the Psammead if you like,’ said Anthea. ‘That is,’ she\nadded, remembering the beast’s queer temper, ‘if it’ll let you.’\n\nThe Psammead, however, was unexpectedly amiable.\n\n‘_I_ don’t mind,’ it said, ‘who carries me, so long as it doesn’t drop\nme. I can’t bear being dropped.’\n\nJane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish-basket under\none arm. The charm’s long string was hung round her neck. Then they all\nstood up. Jane held out the charm at arm’s length, and Cyril solemnly\npronounced the word of power.\n\nAs he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that Jane was\njust holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape.\nThe opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw that he could go\nthrough it. All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and\ntrampled grass of Regent’s Park, where the little ragged children were\nplaying Ring-o’-Roses. But through the opening of it shone a blaze of\nblue and yellow and red. Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his\nlegs so that the others should not see that his knees were trembling and\nalmost knocking together. ‘Here goes!’ he said, and, stepping up through\nthe arch, disappeared. Then followed Anthea. Robert, coming next,\nheld fast, at Anthea’s suggestion, to the sleeve of Jane, who was thus\ndragged safely through the arch. And as soon as they were on the other\nside of the arch there was no more arch at all and no more Regent’s Park\neither, only the charm in Jane’s hand, and it was its proper size again.\nThey were now in a light so bright that they winked and blinked and\nrubbed their eyes. During this dazzling interval Anthea felt for the\ncharm and pushed it inside Jane’s frock, so that it might be quite safe.\nWhen their eyes got used to the new wonderful light the children looked\naround them. The sky was very, very blue, and it sparkled and glittered\nand dazzled like the sea at home when the sun shines on it.\n\nThey were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest; there\nwere trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly undergrowth. In\nfront of them stretched a bank of strange black mud, then came the\nbrowny-yellowy shining ribbon of a river. Then more dry, caked mud and\nmore greeny-browny jungle. The only things that told that human people\nhad been there were the clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd\narrangement of cut reeds in the river.\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n‘Well!’ said Robert, ‘this IS a change of air!’\n\nIt was. The air was hotter than they could have imagined, even in London\nin August.\n\n‘I wish I knew where we were,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Here’s a river, now--I wonder whether it’s the Amazon or the Tiber, or\nwhat.’\n\n‘It’s the Nile,’ said the Psammead, looking out of the fish-bag.\n\n‘Then this is Egypt,’ said Robert, who had once taken a geography prize.\n\n‘I don’t see any crocodiles,’ Cyril objected. His prize had been for\nnatural history.\n\nThe Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed to a\nheap of mud at the edge of the water.\n\n‘What do you call that?’ it said; and as it spoke the heap of mud slid\ninto the river just as a slab of damp mixed mortar will slip from a\nbricklayer’s trowel.\n\n‘Oh!’ said everybody.\n\nThere was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the water.\n\n‘And there’s a river-horse!’ said the Psammead, as a great beast like an\nenormous slaty-blue slug showed itself against the black bank on the far\nside of the stream.\n\n‘It’s a hippopotamus,’ said Cyril; ‘it seems much more real somehow than\nthe one at the Zoo, doesn’t it?’\n\n‘I’m glad it’s being real on the other side of the river,’ said Jane.\nAnd now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them. This was\nhorrible. Of course it might be another hippopotamus, or a crocodile, or\na lion--or, in fact, almost anything.\n\n‘Keep your hand on the charm, Jane,’ said Robert hastily. ‘We ought to\nhave a means of escape handy. I’m dead certain this is the sort of place\nwhere simply anything might happen to us.’\n\n‘I believe a hippopotamus is going to happen to us,’ said Jane--‘a very,\nvery big one.’\n\nThey had all turned to face the danger.\n\n‘Don’t be silly little duffers,’ said the Psammead in its friendly,\ninformal way; ‘it’s not a river-horse. It’s a human.’\n\nIt was. It was a girl--of about Anthea’s age. Her hair was short and\nfair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you could see that it\nwould have been fair too if it had had a chance. She had every chance of\nbeing tanned, for she had no clothes to speak of, and the four English\nchildren, carefully dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings, coats,\ncollars, and all the rest of it, envied her more than any words of\ntheirs or of mine could possibly say. There was no doubt that here was\nthe right costume for that climate.\n\nShe carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware. She did not\nsee the children, who shrank back against the edge of the jungle, and\nshe went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher. As she\nwent she made a strange sort of droning, humming, melancholy noise\nall on two notes. Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl\nthought this noise was singing.\n\nThe girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river bank. Then\nshe waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds. She\npulled half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds, killing\neach as she took it out, and threading it on a long osier that she\ncarried. Then she knotted the osier, hung it on her arm, picked up the\npitcher, and turned to come back. And as she turned she saw the four\nchildren. The white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow\nagainst the dark forest background. She screamed and the pitcher fell,\nand the water was spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the\nfish, which had fallen too. Then the water slowly trickled away into the\ndeep cracks.\n\n‘Don’t be frightened,’ Anthea cried, ‘we won’t hurt you.’\n\n‘Who are you?’ said the girl.\n\nNow, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was\nthat the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the\ngirl. YOU, at any rate, would not understand ME, if I tried to explain\nit, any more than you can understand about time and space being only\nforms of thought. You may think what you like. Perhaps the children\nhad found out the universal language which everyone can understand, and\nwhich wise men so far have not found. You will have noticed long ago\nthat they were singularly lucky children, and they may have had this\npiece of luck as well as others. Or it may have been that... but\nwhy pursue the question further? The fact remains that in all their\nadventures the muddle-headed inventions which we call foreign languages\nnever bothered them in the least. They could always understand and\nbe understood. If you can explain this, please do. I daresay I could\nunderstand your explanation, though you could never understand mine.\n\nSo when the girl said, ‘Who are you?’ everyone understood at once, and\nAnthea replied--\n\n‘We are children--just like you. Don’t be frightened. Won’t you show us\nwhere you live?’\n\nJane put her face right into the Psammead’s basket, and burrowed her\nmouth into its fur to whisper--\n\n‘Is it safe? Won’t they eat us? Are they cannibals?’\n\nThe Psammead shrugged its fur.\n\n‘Don’t make your voice buzz like that, it tickles my ears,’ it said\nrather crossly. ‘You can always get back to Regent’s Park in time if you\nkeep fast hold of the charm,’ it said.\n\nThe strange girl was trembling with fright.\n\nAnthea had a bangle on her arm. It was a sevenpenny-halfpenny trumpery\nthing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart of turquoise\nblue hanging from it, and it was the gift of the maid-of-all-work at the\nFitzroy Street house. ‘Here,’ said Anthea, ‘this is for you. That is\nto show we will not hurt you. And if you take it I shall know that you\nwon’t hurt us.’\n\nThe girl held out her hand. Anthea slid the bangle over it, and the\ngirl’s face lighted up with the joy of possession.\n\n‘Come,’ she said, looking lovingly at the bangle; ‘it is peace between\nyour house and mine.’\n\nShe picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow path by\nwhich she had come and the others followed.\n\n‘This is something like!’ said Cyril, trying to be brave.\n\n‘Yes!’ said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from feeling,\n‘this really and truly IS an adventure! Its being in the Past makes it\nquite different from the Phoenix and Carpet happenings.’\n\nThe belt of thick-growing acacia trees and shrubs--mostly prickly and\nunpleasant-looking--seemed about half a mile across. The path was narrow\nand the wood dark. At last, ahead, daylight shone through the boughs and\nleaves.\n\nThe whole party suddenly came out of the wood’s shadow into the glare of\nthe sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand, dotted with\nheaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson and\npink flowers among their shabby, sand-peppered leaves. Away to the right\nwas something that looked like a grey-brown hedge, and from beyond it\nblue smoke went up to the bluer sky. And over all the sun shone till you\ncould hardly bear your clothes.\n\n‘That is where I live,’ said the girl pointing.\n\n‘I won’t go,’ whispered Jane into the basket, ‘unless you say it’s all\nright.’\n\nThe Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence.\nPerhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of doubt, for it merely\nsnarled--\n\n‘If you don’t go now I’ll never help you again.’\n\n‘OH,’ whispered Anthea, ‘dear Jane, don’t! Think of Father and Mother\nand all of us getting our heart’s desire. And we can go back any minute.\nCome on!’\n\n‘Besides,’ said Cyril, in a low voice, ‘the Psammead must know there’s\nno danger or it wouldn’t go. It’s not so over and above brave itself.\nCome on!’\n\nThis Jane at last consented to do.\n\nAs they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a great\nhedge about eight feet high, made of piled-up thorn bushes.\n\n‘What’s that for?’ asked Cyril.\n\n‘To keep out foes and wild beasts,’ said the girl.\n\n‘I should think it ought to, too,’ said he. ‘Why, some of the thorns are\nas long as my foot.’\n\nThere was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl through\nit. A little way further on was another hedge, not so high, also of dry\nthorn bushes, very prickly and spiteful-looking, and within this was a\nsort of village of huts.\n\nThere were no gardens and no roads. Just huts built of wood and twigs\nand clay, and roofed with great palm-leaves, dumped down anywhere. The\ndoors of these houses were very low, like the doors of dog-kennels.\nThe ground between them was not paths or streets, but just yellow sand\ntrampled very hard and smooth.\n\nIn the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what seemed\nto be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden in Camden Town.\n\nNo sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge than\ndozens of men and women and children came crowding round from behind and\ninside the huts.\n\nThe girl stood protectingly in front of the four children, and said--\n\n‘They are wonder-children from beyond the desert. They bring marvellous\ngifts, and I have said that it is peace between us and them.’\n\nShe held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it.\n\nThe children from London, where nothing now surprises anyone, had never\nbefore seen so many people look so astonished.\n\nThey crowded round the children, touching their clothes, their shoes,\nthe buttons on the boys’ jackets, and the coral of the girls’ necklaces.\n\n‘Do say something,’ whispered Anthea.\n\n‘We come,’ said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when\nhe had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed\na solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the Daily\nTelegraph--‘we come from the world where the sun never sets. And peace\nwith honour is what we want. We are the great Anglo-Saxon or conquering\nrace. Not that we want to conquer YOU,’ he added hastily. ‘We only want\nto look at your houses and your--well, at all you’ve got here, and then\nwe shall return to our own place, and tell of all that we have seen so\nthat your name may be famed.’\n\nCyril’s speech didn’t keep the crowd from pressing round and looking as\neagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. Anthea had an idea\nthat these people had never seen woven stuff before, and she saw how\nwonderful and strange it must seem to people who had never had any\nclothes but the skins of beasts. The sewing, too, of modern clothes\nseemed to astonish them very much. They must have been able to sew\nthemselves, by the way, for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore\nknickerbockers of goat-skin or deer-skin, fastened round the waist\nwith twisted strips of hide. And the women wore long skimpy skirts of\nanimals’ skins. The people were not very tall, their hair was fair, and\nmen and women both had it short. Their eyes were blue, and that seemed\nodd in Egypt. Most of them were tattooed like sailors, only more\nroughly.\n\n‘What is this? What is this?’ they kept asking touching the children’s\nclothes curiously.\n\nAnthea hastily took off Jane’s frilly lace collar and handed it to the\nwoman who seemed most friendly.\n\n‘Take this,’ she said, ‘and look at it. And leave us alone. We want to\ntalk among ourselves.’\n\nShe spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found successful\nwhen she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he was told. The\ntone was just as successful now. The children were left together and the\ncrowd retreated. It paused a dozen yards away to look at the lace collar\nand to go on talking as hard as it could.\n\nThe children will never know what those people said, though they knew\nwell enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject of the talk.\nThey tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl’s promise\nof friendliness, but of course the thought of the charm was more\ncomfortable than anything else. They sat down on the sand in the shadow\nof the hedged-round place in the middle of the village, and now for the\nfirst time they were able to look about them and to see something more\nthan a crowd of eager, curious faces.\n\nThey here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of\ndifferent coloured stone, and from these hung pendants of odd, strange\nshapes, and some of them had bracelets of ivory and flint.\n\n‘I say,’ said Robert, ‘what a lot we could teach them if we stayed\nhere!’\n\n‘I expect they could teach us something too,’ said Cyril. ‘Did you\nnotice that flint bracelet the woman had that Anthea gave the collar to?\nThat must have taken some making. Look here, they’ll get suspicious if\nwe talk among ourselves, and I do want to know about how they do things.\nLet’s get the girl to show us round, and we can be thinking about how to\nget the Amulet at the same time. Only mind, we must keep together.’\n\nAnthea beckoned to the girl, who was standing a little way off looking\nwistfully at them, and she came gladly.\n\n‘Tell us how you make the bracelets, the stone ones,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘With other stones,’ said the girl; ‘the men make them; we have men of\nspecial skill in such work.’\n\n‘Haven’t you any iron tools?’\n\n‘Iron,’ said the girl, ‘I don’t know what you mean.’ It was the first\nword she had not understood.\n\n‘Are all your tools of flint?’ asked Cyril. ‘Of course,’ said the girl,\nopening her eyes wide.\n\nI wish I had time to tell you of that talk. The English children wanted\nto hear all about this new place, but they also wanted to tell of their\nown country. It was like when you come back from your holidays and you\nwant to hear and to tell everything at the same time. As the talk went\non there were more and more words that the girl could not understand,\nand the children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her what their\nown country was like, when they began to see how very few of the things\nthey had always thought they could not do without were really not at all\nnecessary to life.\n\nThe girl showed them how the huts were made--indeed, as one was being\nmade that very day she took them to look at it. The way of building was\nvery different from ours. The men stuck long pieces of wood into a piece\nof ground the size of the hut they wanted to make. These were about\neight inches apart; then they put in another row about eight inches away\nfrom the first, and then a third row still further out. Then all the\nspace between was filled up with small branches and twigs, and then\ndaubed over with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and\nsticky like putty.\n\nThe girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and\narrows, and how they made boats with reeds and clay. Then she explained\nthe reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of. It was a\nfish-trap--just a ring of reeds set up in the water with only one little\nopening in it, and in this opening, just below the water, were stuck\nreeds slanting the way of the river’s flow, so that the fish, when they\nhad swum sillily in, sillily couldn’t get out again. She showed them the\nclay pots and jars and platters, some of them ornamented with black and\nred patterns, and the most wonderful things made of flint and different\nsorts of stone, beads, and ornaments, and tools and weapons of all sorts\nand kinds.\n\n‘It is really wonderful,’ said Cyril patronizingly, ‘when you consider\nthat it’s all eight thousand years ago--’\n\n‘I don’t understand you,’ said the girl.\n\n‘It ISN’T eight thousand years ago,’ whispered Jane. ‘It’s NOW--and\nthat’s just what I don’t like about it. I say, DO let’s get home again\nbefore anything more happens. You can see for yourselves the charm isn’t\nhere.’\n\n‘What’s in that place in the middle?’ asked Anthea, struck by a sudden\nthought, and pointing to the fence.\n\n‘That’s the secret sacred place,’ said the girl in a whisper. ‘No one\nknows what is there. There are many walls, and inside the insidest one\nIT is, but no one knows what IT is except the headsmen.’\n\n‘I believe YOU know,’ said Cyril, looking at her very hard.\n\n‘I’ll give you this if you’ll tell me,’ said Anthea taking off a\nbead-ring which had already been much admired.\n\n‘Yes,’ said the girl, catching eagerly at the ring. ‘My father is one of\nthe heads, and I know a water charm to make him talk in his sleep. And\nhe has spoken. I will tell you. But if they know I have told you they\nwill kill me. In the insidest inside there is a stone box, and in it\nthere is the Amulet. None knows whence it came. It came from very far\naway.’\n\n‘Have you seen it?’ asked Anthea.\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\n‘Is it anything like this?’ asked Jane, rashly producing the charm.\n\nThe girl’s face turned a sickly greenish-white.\n\n‘Hide it, hide it,’ she whispered. ‘You must put it back. If they see it\nthey will kill us all. You for taking it, and me for knowing that there\nwas such a thing. Oh, woe--woe! why did you ever come here?’\n\n‘Don’t be frightened,’ said Cyril. ‘They shan’t know. Jane, don’t you\nbe such a little jack-ape again--that’s all. You see what will happen if\nyou do. Now, tell me--’ He turned to the girl, but before he had time to\nspeak the question there was a loud shout, and a man bounded in through\nthe opening in the thorn-hedge.\n\n‘Many foes are upon us!’ he cried. ‘Make ready the defences!’\n\nHis breath only served for that, and he lay panting on the ground. ‘Oh,\nDO let’s go home!’ said Jane. ‘Look here--I don’t care--I WILL!’\n\nShe held up the charm. Fortunately all the strange, fair people were too\nbusy to notice HER. She held up the charm. And nothing happened.\n\n‘You haven’t said the word of power,’ said Anthea.\n\nJane hastily said it--and still nothing happened.\n\n‘Hold it up towards the East, you silly!’ said Robert.\n\n‘Which IS the East?’ said Jane, dancing about in her agony of terror.\n\nNobody knew. So they opened the fish-bag to ask the Psammead.\n\nAnd the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it.\n\nThe Psammead was gone.\n\n‘Hide the sacred thing! Hide it! Hide it!’ whispered the girl.\n\nCyril shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look as brave as he knew he\nought to feel.\n\n‘Hide it up, Pussy,’ he said. ‘We are in for it now. We’ve just got to\nstay and see it out.’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE FIGHT IN THE VILLAGE\n\nHere was a horrible position! Four English children, whose proper date\nwas A.D. 1905, and whose proper address was London, set down in Egypt in\nthe year 6000 B.C. with no means whatever of getting back into their own\ntime and place. They could not find the East, and the sun was of no use\nat the moment, because some officious person had once explained to Cyril\nthat the sun did not really set in the West at all--nor rise in the East\neither, for the matter of that.\n\nThe Psammead had crept out of the bass-bag when they were not looking\nand had basely deserted them.\n\nAn enemy was approaching. There would be a fight. People get killed\nin fights, and the idea of taking part in a fight was one that did not\nappeal to the children.\n\nThe man who had brought the news of the enemy still lay panting on the\nsand. His tongue was hanging out, long and red, like a dog’s. The\npeople of the village were hurriedly filling the gaps in the fence with\nthorn-bushes from the heap that seemed to have been piled there\nready for just such a need. They lifted the cluster-thorns with long\npoles--much as men at home, nowadays, lift hay with a fork.\n\nJane bit her lip and tried to decide not to cry.\n\nRobert felt in his pocket for a toy pistol and loaded it with a pink\npaper cap. It was his only weapon.\n\nCyril tightened his belt two holes.\n\nAnd Anthea absently took the drooping red roses from the buttonholes of\nthe others, bit the ends of the stalks, and set them in a pot of water\nthat stood in the shadow by a hut door. She was always rather silly\nabout flowers.\n\n‘Look here!’ she said. ‘I think perhaps the Psammead is really arranging\nsomething for us. I don’t believe it would go away and leave us all\nalone in the Past. I’m certain it wouldn’t.’\n\nJane succeeded in deciding not to cry--at any rate yet.\n\n‘But what can we do?’ Robert asked.\n\n‘Nothing,’ Cyril answered promptly, ‘except keep our eyes and ears open.\nLook! That runner chap’s getting his wind. Let’s go and hear what he’s\ngot to say.’\n\nThe runner had risen to his knees and was sitting back on his heels. Now\nhe stood up and spoke. He began by some respectful remarks addressed to\nthe heads of the village. His speech got more interesting when he said--\n\n‘I went out in my raft to snare ibises, and I had gone up the stream an\nhour’s journey. Then I set my snares and waited. And I heard the sound\nof many wings, and looking up, saw many herons circling in the air. And\nI saw that they were afraid; so I took thought. A beast may scare one\nheron, coming upon it suddenly, but no beast will scare a whole flock of\nherons. And still they flew and circled, and would not light. So then I\nknew that what scared the herons must be men, and men who knew not our\nways of going softly so as to take the birds and beasts unawares. By\nthis I knew they were not of our race or of our place. So, leaving my\nraft, I crept along the river bank, and at last came upon the strangers.\nThey are many as the sands of the desert, and their spear-heads shine\nred like the sun. They are a terrible people, and their march is towards\nUS. Having seen this, I ran, and did not stay till I was before you.’\n\n‘These are YOUR folk,’ said the headman, turning suddenly and angrily on\nCyril, ‘you came as spies for them.’\n\n‘We did NOT,’ said Cyril indignantly. ‘We wouldn’t be spies for\nanything. I’m certain these people aren’t a bit like us. Are they now?’\nhe asked the runner.\n\n‘No,’ was the answer. ‘These men’s faces were darkened, and their hair\nblack as night. Yet these strange children, maybe, are their gods, who\nhave come before to make ready the way for them.’\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd.\n\n‘No, NO,’ said Cyril again. ‘We are on your side. We will help you to\nguard your sacred things.’\n\nThe headman seemed impressed by the fact that Cyril knew that there WERE\nsacred things to be guarded. He stood a moment gazing at the children.\nThen he said--\n\n‘It is well. And now let all make offering, that we may be strong in\nbattle.’\n\nThe crowd dispersed, and nine men, wearing antelope-skins, grouped\nthemselves in front of the opening in the hedge in the middle of\nthe village. And presently, one by one, the men brought all sorts of\nthings--hippopotamus flesh, ostrich-feathers, the fruit of the date\npalms, red chalk, green chalk, fish from the river, and ibex from the\nmountains; and the headman received these gifts. There was another hedge\ninside the first, about a yard from it, so that there was a lane inside\nbetween the hedges. And every now and then one of the headmen would\ndisappear along this lane with full hands and come back with hands\nempty.\n\n‘They’re making offerings to their Amulet,’ said Anthea. ‘We’d better\ngive something too.’\n\nThe pockets of the party, hastily explored, yielded a piece of pink\ntape, a bit of sealing-wax, and part of the Waterbury watch that Robert\nhad not been able to help taking to pieces at Christmas and had never\nhad time to rearrange. Most boys have a watch in this condition. They\npresented their offerings, and Anthea added the red roses.\n\nThe headman who took the things looked at them with awe, especially at\nthe red roses and the Waterbury-watch fragment.\n\n‘This is a day of very wondrous happenings,’ he said. ‘I have no more\nroom in me to be astonished. Our maiden said there was peace between you\nand us. But for this coming of a foe we should have made sure.’\n\nThe children shuddered.\n\n‘Now speak. Are you upon our side?’\n\n‘YES. Don’t I keep telling you we are?’ Robert said. ‘Look here. I will\ngive you a sign. You see this.’ He held out the toy pistol. ‘I shall\nspeak to it, and if it answers me you will know that I and the others\nare come to guard your sacred thing--that we’ve just made the offerings\nto.’\n\n‘Will that god whose image you hold in your hand speak to you alone, or\nshall I also hear it?’ asked the man cautiously.\n\n‘You’ll be surprised when you DO hear it,’ said Robert. ‘Now, then.’ He\nlooked at the pistol and said--\n\n‘If we are to guard the sacred treasure within’--he pointed to the\nhedged-in space--‘speak with thy loud voice, and we shall obey.’\n\nHe pulled the trigger, and the cap went off. The noise was loud, for it\nwas a two-shilling pistol, and the caps were excellent.\n\nEvery man, woman, and child in the village fell on its face on the sand.\nThe headman who had accepted the test rose first.\n\n‘The voice has spoken,’ he said. ‘Lead them into the ante-room of the\nsacred thing.’\n\nSo now the four children were led in through the opening of the hedge\nand round the lane till they came to an opening in the inner hedge, and\nthey went through an opening in that, and so passed into another lane.\n\nThe thing was built something like this, and all the hedges were of\nbrushwood and thorns: [Drawing of maze omitted.]\n\n‘It’s like the maze at Hampton Court,’ whispered Anthea.\n\nThe lanes were all open to the sky, but the little hut in the middle of\nthe maze was round-roofed, and a curtain of skins hung over the doorway.\n\n‘Here you may wait,’ said their guide, ‘but do not dare to pass the\ncurtain.’ He himself passed it and disappeared.\n\n‘But look here,’ whispered Cyril, ‘some of us ought to be outside in\ncase the Psammead turns up.’\n\n‘Don’t let’s get separated from each other, whatever we do,’ said\nAnthea. ‘It’s quite bad enough to be separated from the Psammead. We\ncan’t do anything while that man is in there. Let’s all go out into\nthe village again. We can come back later now we know the way in.\nThat man’ll have to fight like the rest, most likely, if it comes to\nfighting. If we find the Psammead we’ll go straight home.\n\nIt must be getting late, and I don’t much like this mazy place.’\n\nThey went out and told the headman that they would protect the treasure\nwhen the fighting began. And now they looked about them and were able\nto see exactly how a first-class worker in flint flakes and notches an\narrow-head or the edge of an axe--an advantage which no other person now\nalive has ever enjoyed. The boys found the weapons most interesting.\nThe arrow-heads were not on arrows such as you shoot from a bow, but\non javelins, for throwing from the hand. The chief weapon was a stone\nfastened to a rather short stick something like the things gentlemen\nused to carry about and call life-preservers in the days of the\ngarrotters.\n\nThen there were long things like spears or lances, with flint\nknives--horribly sharp--and flint battle-axes.\n\nEveryone in the village was so busy that the place was like an ant-heap\nwhen you have walked into it by accident. The women were busy and even\nthe children.\n\nQuite suddenly all the air seemed to glow and grow red--it was like\nthe sudden opening of a furnace door, such as you may see at Woolwich\nArsenal if you ever have the luck to be taken there--and then almost as\nsuddenly it was as though the furnace doors had been shut. For the sun\nhad set, and it was night.\n\nThe sun had that abrupt way of setting in Egypt eight thousand years\nago, and I believe it has never been able to break itself of the habit,\nand sets in exactly the same manner to the present day. The girl brought\nthe skins of wild deer and led the children to a heap of dry sedge.\n\n‘My father says they will not attack yet. Sleep!’ she said, and it\nreally seemed a good idea. You may think that in the midst of all these\ndangers the children would not have been able to sleep--but somehow,\nthough they were rather frightened now and then, the feeling was growing\nin them--deep down and almost hidden away, but still growing--that the\nPsammead was to be trusted, and that they were really and truly safe.\nThis did not prevent their being quite as much frightened as they could\nbear to be without being perfectly miserable.\n\n‘I suppose we’d better go to sleep,’ said Robert. ‘I don’t know what on\nearth poor old Nurse will do with us out all night; set the police on\nour tracks, I expect. I only wish they could find us! A dozen policemen\nwould be rather welcome just now. But it’s no use getting into a stew\nover it,’ he added soothingly. ‘Good night.’\n\nAnd they all fell asleep.\n\nThey were awakened by long, loud, terrible sounds that seemed to come\nfrom everywhere at once--horrible threatening shouts and shrieks\nand howls that sounded, as Cyril said later, like the voices of men\nthirsting for their enemies’ blood.\n\n‘It is the voice of the strange men,’ said the girl, coming to them\ntrembling through the dark. ‘They have attacked the walls, and the\nthorns have driven them back. My father says they will not try again\ntill daylight. But they are shouting to frighten us. As though we were\nsavages! Dwellers in the swamps!’ she cried indignantly.\n\nAll night the terrible noise went on, but when the sun rose, as abruptly\nas he had set, the sound suddenly ceased.\n\nThe children had hardly time to be glad of this before a shower\nof javelins came hurtling over the great thorn-hedge, and everyone\nsheltered behind the huts. But next moment another shower of weapons\ncame from the opposite side, and the crowd rushed to other shelter.\nCyril pulled out a javelin that had stuck in the roof of the hut beside\nhim. Its head was of brightly burnished copper.\n\nThen the sound of shouting arose again and the crackle of dried thorns.\nThe enemy was breaking down the hedge. All the villagers swarmed to the\npoint whence the crackling and the shouting came; they hurled stones\nover the hedges, and short arrows with flint heads. The children had\nnever before seen men with the fighting light in their eyes. It was very\nstrange and terrible, and gave you a queer thick feeling in your throat;\nit was quite different from the pictures of fights in the illustrated\npapers at home.\n\nIt seemed that the shower of stones had driven back the besiegers. The\nbesieged drew breath, but at that moment the shouting and the crackling\narose on the opposite side of the village and the crowd hastened\nto defend that point, and so the fight swayed to and fro across the\nvillage, for the besieged had not the sense to divide their forces as\ntheir enemies had done.\n\nCyril noticed that every now and then certain of the fighting-men would\nenter the maze, and come out with brighter faces, a braver aspect, and a\nmore upright carriage.\n\n‘I believe they go and touch the Amulet,’ he said. ‘You know the\nPsammead said it could make people brave.’\n\nThey crept through the maze, and watching they saw that Cyril was right.\nA headman was standing in front of the skin curtain, and as the warriors\ncame before him he murmured a word they could not hear, and touched\ntheir foreheads with something that they could not see. And this\nsomething he held in his hands. And through his fingers they saw the\ngleam of a red stone that they knew.\n\nThe fight raged across the thorn-hedge outside. Suddenly there was a\nloud and bitter cry.\n\n‘They’re in! They’re in! The hedge is down!’\n\nThe headman disappeared behind the deer-skin curtain.\n\n‘He’s gone to hide it,’ said Anthea. ‘Oh, Psammead dear, how could you\nleave us!’\n\nSuddenly there was a shriek from inside the hut, and the headman\nstaggered out white with fear and fled out through the maze. The\nchildren were as white as he.\n\n‘Oh! What is it? What is it?’ moaned Anthea. ‘Oh, Psammead, how could\nyou! How could you!’\n\nAnd the sound of the fight sank breathlessly, and swelled fiercely all\naround. It was like the rising and falling of the waves of the sea.\n\nAnthea shuddered and said again, ‘Oh, Psammead, Psammead!’\n\n‘Well?’ said a brisk voice, and the curtain of skins was lifted at one\ncorner by a furry hand, and out peeped the bat’s ears and snail’s eyes\nof the Psammead.\n\nAnthea caught it in her arms and a sigh of desperate relief was breathed\nby each of the four.\n\n‘Oh! which IS the East!’ Anthea said, and she spoke hurriedly, for the\nnoise of wild fighting drew nearer and nearer.\n\n‘Don’t choke me,’ said the Psammead, ‘come inside.’\n\nThe inside of the hut was pitch dark.\n\n‘I’ve got a match,’ said Cyril, and struck it. The floor of the hut was\nof soft, loose sand.\n\n‘I’ve been asleep here,’ said the Psammead; ‘most comfortable it’s been,\nthe best sand I’ve had for a month. It’s all right. Everything’s all\nright. I knew your only chance would be while the fight was going on.\nThat man won’t come back. I bit him, and he thinks I’m an Evil Spirit.\nNow you’ve only got to take the thing and go.’\n\nThe hut was hung with skins. Heaped in the middle were the offerings\nthat had been given the night before, Anthea’s roses fading on the top\nof the heap. At one side of the hut stood a large square stone block,\nand on it an oblong box of earthenware with strange figures of men and\nbeasts on it.\n\n‘Is the thing in there?’ asked Cyril, as the Psammead pointed a skinny\nfinger at it.\n\n‘You must judge of that,’ said the Psammead. ‘The man was just going to\nbury the box in the sand when I jumped out at him and bit him.’\n\n‘Light another match, Robert,’ said Anthea. ‘Now, then quick! which is\nthe East?’\n\n‘Why, where the sun rises, of course!’\n\n‘But someone told us--’\n\n‘Oh! they’ll tell you anything!’ said the Psammead impatiently, getting\ninto its bass-bag and wrapping itself in its waterproof sheet.\n\n‘But we can’t see the sun in here, and it isn’t rising anyhow,’ said\nJane.\n\n‘How you do waste time!’ the Psammead said. ‘Why, the East’s where the\nshrine is, of course. THERE!’\n\nIt pointed to the great stone.\n\nAnd still the shouting and the clash of stone on metal sounded nearer\nand nearer. The children could hear that the headmen had surrounded the\nhut to protect their treasure as long as might be from the enemy. But\nnone dare to come in after the Psammead’s sudden fierce biting of the\nheadman.\n\n‘Now, Jane,’ said Cyril, very quickly. ‘I’ll take the Amulet, you stand\nready to hold up the charm, and be sure you don’t let it go as you come\nthrough.’\n\nHe made a step forward, but at that instant a great crackling overhead\nended in a blaze of sunlight. The roof had been broken in at one side,\nand great slabs of it were being lifted off by two spears. As the\nchildren trembled and winked in the new light, large dark hands tore\ndown the wall, and a dark face, with a blobby fat nose, looked over the\ngap. Even at that awful moment Anthea had time to think that it was very\nlike the face of Mr Jacob Absalom, who had sold them the charm in the\nshop near Charing Cross.\n\n‘Here is their Amulet,’ cried a harsh, strange voice; ‘it is this that\nmakes them strong to fight and brave to die. And what else have we\nhere--gods or demons?’\n\nHe glared fiercely at the children, and the whites of his eyes were very\nwhite indeed. He had a wet, red copper knife in his teeth. There was not\na moment to lose.\n\n‘Jane, JANE, QUICK!’ cried everyone passionately.\n\nJane with trembling hands held up the charm towards the East, and Cyril\nspoke the word of power. The Amulet grew to a great arch. Out beyond\nit was the glaring Egyptian sky, the broken wall, the cruel, dark,\nbig-nosed face with the red, wet knife in its gleaming teeth. Within the\narch was the dull, faint, greeny-brown of London grass and trees.\n\n‘Hold tight, Jane!’ Cyril cried, and he dashed through the arch,\ndragging Anthea and the Psammead after him. Robert followed, clutching\nJane. And in the ears of each, as they passed through the arch of the\ncharm, the sound and fury of battle died out suddenly and utterly, and\nthey heard only the low, dull, discontented hum of vast London, and the\npeeking and patting of the sparrows on the gravel and the voices of the\nragged baby children playing Ring-o’-Roses on the yellow trampled grass.\nAnd the charm was a little charm again in Jane’s hand, and there was the\nbasket with their dinner and the bathbuns lying just where they had left\nit.\n\n‘My hat!’ said Cyril, drawing a long breath; ‘that was something like an\nadventure.’\n\n‘It was rather like one, certainly,’ said the Psammead.\n\nThey all lay still, breathing in the safe, quiet air of Regent’s Park.\n\n‘We’d better go home at once,’ said Anthea presently. ‘Old Nurse will be\nmost frightfully anxious. The sun looks about the same as it did when\nwe started yesterday. We’ve been away twenty-four hours.’ ‘The buns are\nquite soft still,’ said Cyril, feeling one; ‘I suppose the dew kept them\nfresh.’\n\nThey were not hungry, curiously enough.\n\nThey picked up the dinner-basket and the Psammead-basket, and went\nstraight home.\n\nOld Nurse met them with amazement.\n\n‘Well, if ever I did!’ she said. ‘What’s gone wrong? You’ve soon tired\nof your picnic.’\n\nThe children took this to be bitter irony, which means saying the exact\nopposite of what you mean in order to make yourself disagreeable; as\nwhen you happen to have a dirty face, and someone says, ‘How nice and\nclean you look!’\n\n‘We’re very sorry,’ began Anthea, but old Nurse said--\n\n‘Oh, bless me, child, I don’t care! Please yourselves and you’ll please\nme. Come in and get your dinners comf’table. I’ve got a potato on\na-boiling.’\n\nWhen she had gone to attend to the potatoes the children looked at each\nother. Could it be that old Nurse had so changed that she no longer\ncared that they should have been away from home for twenty-four\nhours--all night in fact--without any explanation whatever?\n\nBut the Psammead put its head out of its basket and said--\n\n‘What’s the matter? Don’t you understand? You come back through the\ncharm-arch at the same time as you go through it. This isn’t tomorrow!’\n‘Is it still yesterday?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘No, it’s today. The same as it’s always been. It wouldn’t do to go\nmixing up the present and the Past, and cutting bits out of one to fit\ninto the other.’\n\n‘Then all that adventure took no time at all?’\n\n‘You can call it that if you like,’ said the Psammead. ‘It took none of\nthe modern time, anyhow.’\n\nThat evening Anthea carried up a steak for the learned gentleman’s\ndinner. She persuaded Beatrice, the maid-of-all-work, who had given her\nthe bangle with the blue stone, to let her do it. And she stayed and\ntalked to him, by special invitation, while he ate the dinner.\n\nShe told him the whole adventure, beginning with--\n\n‘This afternoon we found ourselves on the bank of the River Nile,’ and\nending up with, ‘And then we remembered how to get back, and there we\nwere in Regent’s Park, and it hadn’t taken any time at all.’\n\nShe did not tell anything about the charm or the Psammead, because that\nwas forbidden, but the story was quite wonderful enough even as it was\nto entrance the learned gentleman.\n\n‘You are a most unusual little girl,’ he said. ‘Who tells you all these\nthings?’\n\n‘No one,’ said Anthea, ‘they just happen.’\n\n‘Make-believe,’ he said slowly, as one who recalls and pronounces a\nlong-forgotten word.\n\nHe sat long after she had left him. At last he roused himself with a\nstart.\n\n‘I really must take a holiday,’ he said; ‘my nerves must be all out of\norder. I actually have a perfectly distinct impression that the little\ngirl from the rooms below came in and gave me a coherent and graphic\npicture of life as I conceive it to have been in pre-dynastic Egypt.\nStrange what tricks the mind will play! I shall have to be more\ncareful.’\n\nHe finished his bread conscientiously, and actually went for a mile walk\nbefore he went back to his work.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. THE WAY TO BABYLON\n\n   ‘How many miles to Babylon?\n   Three score and ten!\n   Can I get there by candle light?\n   Yes, and back again!’\n\nJane was singing to her doll, rocking it to and fro in the house\nwhich she had made for herself and it. The roof of the house was the\ndining-table, and the walls were tablecloths and antimacassars hanging\nall round, and kept in their places by books laid on their top ends at\nthe table edge.\n\nThe others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic tobogganing. You\nknow how it is done--with the largest and best tea-tray and the surface\nof the stair carpet. It is best to do it on the days when the stair rods\nare being cleaned, and the carpet is only held by the nails at the top.\nOf course, it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip-top games that\ngrown-up people are so unjust to--and old Nurse, though a brick in many\nrespects, was quite enough of a standard grown-up to put her foot down\non the tobogganing long before any of the performers had had half enough\nof it. The tea-tray was taken away, and the baffled party entered the\nsitting-room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they could help\nit.\n\nSo Cyril said, ‘What a beastly mess!’\n\nAnd Robert added, ‘Do shut up, Jane!’\n\nEven Anthea, who was almost always kind, advised Jane to try another\nsong. ‘I’m sick to death of that,’ said she.\n\nIt was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of\nLondon that can be seen for nothing could be carried out. Everyone had\nbeen thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day\nbefore, when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch,\nthrough which they had walked straight out of the present time and\nthe Regent’s Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago.\nThe memory of yesterday’s happenings was still extremely fresh and\nfrightening, so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another\nexcursion into the past, for it seemed to all that yesterday’s\nadventures were quite enough to last for at least a week. Yet each felt\na little anxious that the others should not think it was afraid, and\npresently Cyril, who really was not a coward, began to see that it would\nnot be at all nice if he should have to think himself one. So he said--\n\n‘I say--about that charm--Jane--come out. We ought to talk about it,\nanyhow.’\n\n‘Oh, if that’s all,’ said Robert.\n\nJane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there.\n\nShe felt for the charm, to make sure that it was still round her neck.\n\n‘It ISN’T all,’ said Cyril, saying much more than he meant because he\nthought Robert’s tone had been rude--as indeed it had.\n\n‘We ought to go and look for that Amulet. What’s the good of having a\nfirst-class charm and keeping it idle, just eating its head off in the\nstable.’\n\n‘I’M game for anything, of course,’ said Robert; but he added, with\na fine air of chivalry, ‘only I don’t think the girls are keen today\nsomehow.’\n\n‘Oh, yes; I am,’ said Anthea hurriedly. ‘If you think I’m afraid, I’m\nnot.’\n\n‘I am though,’ said Jane heavily; ‘I didn’t like it, and I won’t go\nthere again--not for anything I won’t.’\n\n‘We shouldn’t go THERE again, silly,’ said Cyril; ‘it would be some\nother place.’\n\n‘I daresay; a place with lions and tigers in it as likely as not.’\n\nSeeing Jane so frightened, made the others feel quite brave. They said\nthey were certain they ought to go.\n\n‘It’s so ungrateful to the Psammead not to,’ Anthea added, a little\nprimly.\n\nJane stood up. She was desperate.\n\n‘I won’t!’ she cried; ‘I won’t, I won’t, I won’t! If you make me I’ll\nscream and I’ll scream, and I’ll tell old Nurse, and I’ll get her to\nburn the charm in the kitchen fire. So now, then!’\n\nYou can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling what each\nof them had felt all the morning. In each breast the same thought arose,\n‘No one can say it’s OUR fault.’ And they at once began to show Jane\nhow angry they all felt that all the fault was hers. This made them feel\nquite brave.\n\n   ‘Tell-tale tit, its tongue shall be split,\n   And all the dogs in our town shall have a little bit,’\n\nsang Robert.\n\n‘It’s always the way if you have girls in anything.’ Cyril spoke in a\ncold displeasure that was worse than Robert’s cruel quotation, and even\nAnthea said, ‘Well, I’M not afraid if I AM a girl,’ which of course, was\nthe most cutting thing of all.\n\nJane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is sometimes\ncalled the courage of despair.\n\n‘I don’t care,’ she said; ‘I won’t, so there! It’s just silly going\nto places when you don’t want to, and when you don’t know what they’re\ngoing to be like! You can laugh at me as much as you like. You’re\nbeasts--and I hate you all!’\n\nWith these awful words she went out and banged the door.\n\nThen the others would not look at each other, and they did not feel so\nbrave as they had done.\n\nCyril took up a book, but it was not interesting to read. Robert kicked\na chair-leg absently. His feet were always eloquent in moments of\nemotion. Anthea stood pleating the end of the tablecloth into folds--she\nseemed earnestly anxious to get all the pleats the same size. The sound\nof Jane’s sobs had died away.\n\nSuddenly Anthea said, ‘Oh! let it be “pax”--poor little Pussy--you know\nshe’s the youngest.’\n\n‘She called us beasts,’ said Robert, kicking the chair suddenly.\n\n‘Well, said Cyril, who was subject to passing fits of justice,\n‘we began, you know. At least you did.’ Cyril’s justice was always\nuncompromising.\n\n‘I’m not going to say I’m sorry if you mean that,’ said Robert, and the\nchair-leg cracked to the kick he gave as he said it.\n\n‘Oh, do let’s,’ said Anthea, ‘we’re three to one, and Mother does so\nhate it if we row. Come on. I’ll say I’m sorry first, though I didn’t\nsay anything, hardly.’\n\n‘All right, let’s get it over,’ said Cyril, opening the\ndoor.’Hi--you--Pussy!’\n\nFar away up the stairs a voice could be heard singing brokenly, but\nstill defiantly--\n\n   ‘How many miles (sniff) to Babylon?\n   Three score and ten! (sniff)\n   Can I get there by candle light?\n   Yes (sniff), and back again!’\n\nIt was trying, for this was plainly meant to annoy. But Anthea would not\ngive herself time to think this. She led the way up the stairs, taking\nthree at a time, and bounded to the level of Jane, who sat on the top\nstep of all, thumping her doll to the tune of the song she was trying to\nsing.\n\n‘I say, Pussy, let it be pax! We’re sorry if you are--’\n\nIt was enough. The kiss of peace was given by all. Jane being the\nyoungest was entitled to this ceremonial. Anthea added a special apology\nof her own.\n\n‘I’m sorry if I was a pig, Pussy dear,’ she said--‘especially because\nin my really and truly inside mind I’ve been feeling a little as if\nI’d rather not go into the Past again either. But then, do think. If we\ndon’t go we shan’t get the Amulet, and oh, Pussy, think if we could only\nget Father and Mother and The Lamb safe back! We MUST go, but we’ll wait\na day or two if you like and then perhaps you’ll feel braver.’\n\n‘Raw meat makes you brave, however cowardly you are,’ said Robert, to\nshow that there was now no ill-feeling, ‘and cranberries--that’s\nwhat Tartars eat, and they’re so brave it’s simply awful. I suppose\ncranberries are only for Christmas time, but I’ll ask old Nurse to let\nyou have your chop very raw if you like.’\n\n‘I think I could be brave without that,’ said Jane hastily; she hated\nunderdone meat. ‘I’ll try.’\n\nAt this moment the door of the learned gentleman’s room opened, and he\nlooked out.\n\n‘Excuse me,’ he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of his, ‘but\nwas I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word just now? Were\nyou not singing some old ballad of Babylon?’\n\n‘No,’ said Robert, ‘at least Jane was singing “How many miles,” but I\nshouldn’t have thought you could have heard the words for--’\n\nHe would have said, ‘for the sniffing,’ but Anthea pinched him just in\ntime.\n\n‘I did not hear ALL the words,’ said the learned gentleman. ‘I wonder\nwould you recite them to me?’\n\nSo they all said together--\n\n   ‘How many miles to Babylon?\n   Three score and ten!\n   Can I get there by candle light?\n   Yes, and back again!’\n\n‘I wish one could,’ the learned gentleman said with a sigh.\n\n‘Can’t you?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘Babylon has fallen,’ he answered with a sigh. ‘You know it was once a\ngreat and beautiful city, and the centre of learning and Art, and now\nit is only ruins, and so covered up with earth that people are not even\nagreed as to where it once stood.’\n\nHe was leaning on the banisters, and his eyes had a far-away look in\nthem, as though he could see through the staircase window the splendour\nand glory of ancient Babylon.\n\n‘I say,’ Cyril remarked abruptly. ‘You know that charm we showed you,\nand you told us how to say the name that’s on it?’\n\n‘Yes!’\n\n‘Well, do you think that charm was ever in Babylon?’\n\n‘It’s quite possible,’ the learned gentleman replied. ‘Such charms have\nbeen found in very early Egyptian tombs, yet their origin has not been\naccurately determined as Egyptian. They may have been brought from Asia.\nOr, supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt, it might very\nwell have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy, or brought\nback by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part of the\nspoils of war. The inscription may be much later than the charm. Oh yes!\nit is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours was once\nused amid Babylonish surroundings.’ The others looked at each other, but\nit was Jane who spoke.\n\n‘Were the Babylon people savages, were they always fighting and throwing\nthings about?’ For she had read the thoughts of the others by the\nunerring light of her own fears.\n\n‘The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the Assyrians,’ said\nthe learned gentleman. ‘And they were not savages by any means. A very\nhigh level of culture,’ he looked doubtfully at his audience and went\non, ‘I mean that they made beautiful statues and jewellery, and\nbuilt splendid palaces. And they were very learned--they had glorious\nlibraries and high towers for the purpose of astrological and\nastronomical observation.’\n\n‘Er?’ said Robert.\n\n‘I mean for--star-gazing and fortune-telling,’ said the learned\ngentleman, ‘and there were temples and beautiful hanging gardens--’\n\n‘I’ll go to Babylon if you like,’ said Jane abruptly, and the others\nhastened to say ‘Done!’ before she should have time to change her mind.\n\n‘Ah,’ said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly, ‘one can go so\nfar in dreams, when one is young.’ He sighed again, and then adding with\na laboured briskness, ‘I hope you’ll have a--a--jolly game,’ he went\ninto his room and shut the door.\n\n‘He said “jolly” as if it was a foreign language,’ said Cyril. ‘Come\non, let’s get the Psammead and go now. I think Babylon seems a most\nfrightfully jolly place to go to.’\n\nSo they woke the Psammead and put it in its bass-bag with the waterproof\nsheet, in case of inclement weather in Babylon. It was very cross, but\nit said it would as soon go to Babylon as anywhere else. ‘The sand is\ngood thereabouts,’ it added.\n\nThen Jane held up the charm, and Cyril said--\n\n‘We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was lost.\nWill you please let us go there through you?’\n\n‘Please put us down just outside,’ said Jane hastily; ‘and then if we\ndon’t like it we needn’t go inside.’\n\n‘Don’t be all day,’ said the Psammead.\n\nSo Anthea hastily uttered the word of power, without which the charm\ncould do nothing.\n\n‘Ur--Hekau--Setcheh!’ she said softly, and as she spoke the charm grew\ninto an arch so tall that the top of it was close against the bedroom\nceiling. Outside the arch was the bedroom painted chest-of-drawers\nand the Kidderminster carpet, and the washhand-stand with the riveted\nwillow-pattern jug, and the faded curtains, and the dull light of\nindoors on a wet day. Through the arch showed the gleam of soft green\nleaves and white blossoms. They stepped forward quite happily. Even Jane\nfelt that this did not look like lions, and her hand hardly trembled\nat all as she held the charm for the others to go through, and last,\nslipped through herself, and hung the charm, now grown small again,\nround her neck.\n\nThe children found themselves under a white-blossomed, green-leafed\nfruit-tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of such trees, all\nwhite-flowered and green-foliaged. Among the long green grass under\ntheir feet grew crocuses and lilies, and strange blue flowers. In the\nbranches overhead thrushes and blackbirds were singing, and the coo of a\npigeon came softly to them in the green quietness of the orchard.\n\n‘Oh, how perfectly lovely!’ cried Anthea.\n\n‘Why, it’s like home exactly--I mean England--only everything’s bluer,\nand whiter, and greener, and the flowers are bigger.’\n\nThe boys owned that it certainly was fairly decent, and even Jane\nadmitted that it was all very pretty.\n\n‘I’m certain there’s nothing to be frightened of here,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘I don’t know,’ said Jane. ‘I suppose the fruit-trees go on just the\nsame even when people are killing each other. I didn’t half like what\nthe learned gentleman said about the hanging gardens. I suppose they\nhave gardens on purpose to hang people in. I do hope this isn’t one.’\n\n‘Of course it isn’t,’ said Cyril. ‘The hanging gardens are just gardens\nhung up--_I_ think on chains between houses, don’t you know, like trays.\nCome on; let’s get somewhere.’\n\nThey began to walk through the cool grass. As far as they could see was\nnothing but trees, and trees and more trees. At the end of their orchard\nwas another one, only separated from theirs by a little stream of\nclear water. They jumped this, and went on. Cyril, who was fond of\ngardening--which meant that he liked to watch the gardener at work--was\nable to command the respect of the others by telling them the names of\na good many trees. There were nut-trees and almond-trees, and apricots,\nand fig-trees with their big five-fingered leaves. And every now and\nthen the children had to cross another brook.\n\n‘It’s like between the squares in Through the Looking-glass,’ said\nAnthea.\n\nAt last they came to an orchard which was quite different from the other\norchards. It had a low building in one corner.\n\n‘These are vines,’ said Cyril superiorly, ‘and I know this is a\nvineyard. I shouldn’t wonder if there was a wine-press inside that place\nover there.’\n\nAt last they got out of the orchards and on to a sort of road, very\nrough, and not at all like the roads you are used to. It had cypress\ntrees and acacia trees along it, and a sort of hedge of tamarisks,\nlike those you see on the road between Nice and Cannes, or near\nLittlehampton, if you’ve only been as far as that.\n\nAnd now in front of them they could see a great mass of buildings.\nThere were scattered houses of wood and stone here and there among green\norchards, and beyond these a great wall that shone red in the early\nmorning sun. The wall was enormously high--more than half the height of\nSt Paul’s--and in the wall were set enormous gates that shone like gold\nas the rising sun beat on them. Each gate had a solid square tower on\neach side of it that stood out from the wall and rose above it. Beyond\nthe wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and bright\ncolours. Away to the left ran the steel-blue swirl of a great river.\nAnd the children could see, through a gap in the trees, that the river\nflowed out from the town under a great arch in the wall.\n\n‘Those feathery things along by the water are palms,’ said Cyril\ninstructively.\n\n‘Oh, yes; you know everything,’ Robert replied. ‘What’s all that\ngrey-green stuff you see away over there, where it’s all flat and\nsandy?’\n\n‘All right,’ said Cyril loftily, ‘_I_ don’t want to tell you anything. I\nonly thought you’d like to know a palm-tree when you saw it again.’\n\n‘Look!’ cried Anthea; ‘they’re opening the gates.’\n\nAnd indeed the great gates swung back with a brazen clang, and instantly\na little crowd of a dozen or more people came out and along the road\ntowards them.\n\nThe children, with one accord, crouched behind the tamarisk hedge.\n\n‘I don’t like the sound of those gates,’ said Jane. ‘Fancy being inside\nwhen they shut. You’d never get out.’\n\n‘You’ve got an arch of your own to go out by,’ the Psammead put its head\nout of the basket to remind her. ‘Don’t behave so like a girl. If I were\nyou I should just march right into the town and ask to see the king.’\n\nThere was something at once simple and grand about this idea, and it\npleased everyone.\n\nSo when the work-people had passed (they WERE work-people, the children\nfelt sure, because they were dressed so plainly--just one long blue\nshirt thing--of blue or yellow) the four children marched boldly up to\nthe brazen gate between the towers. The arch above the gate was quite a\ntunnel, the walls were so thick.\n\n‘Courage,’ said Cyril. ‘Step out. It’s no use trying to sneak past. Be\nbold!’\n\nRobert answered this appeal by unexpectedly bursting into ‘The British\nGrenadiers’, and to its quick-step they approached the gates of Babylon.\n\n   ‘Some talk of Alexander,\n   And some of Hercules,\n   Of Hector and Lysander,\n   And such great names as these.\n   But of all the gallant heroes...’\n\nThis brought them to the threshold of the gate, and two men in bright\narmour suddenly barred their way with crossed spears.\n\n‘Who goes there?’ they said.\n\n(I think I must have explained to you before how it was that the\nchildren were always able to understand the language of any place they\nmight happen to be in, and to be themselves understood. If not, I have\nno time to explain it now.)\n\n‘We come from very far,’ said Cyril mechanically. ‘From the Empire where\nthe sun never sets, and we want to see your King.’\n\n‘If it’s quite convenient,’ amended Anthea. ‘The King (may he live for\never!),’ said the gatekeeper, ‘is gone to fetch home his fourteenth\nwife. Where on earth have you come from not to know that?’\n\n‘The Queen then,’ said Anthea hurriedly, and not taking any notice of\nthe question as to where they had come from.\n\n‘The Queen,’ said the gatekeeper, ‘(may she live for ever!) gives\naudience today three hours after sunrising.’\n\n‘But what are we to do till the end of the three hours?’ asked Cyril.\n\nThe gatekeeper seemed neither to know nor to care. He appeared less\ninterested in them than they could have thought possible. But the man\nwho had crossed spears with him to bar the children’s way was more\nhuman.\n\n‘Let them go in and look about them,’ he said. ‘I’ll wager my best sword\nthey’ve never seen anything to come near our little--village.’ He said\nit in the tone people use for when they call the Atlantic Ocean the\n‘herring pond’.\n\nThe gatekeeper hesitated.\n\n‘They’re only children, after all,’ said the other, who had children of\nhis own. ‘Let me off for a few minutes, Captain, and I’ll take them\nto my place and see if my good woman can’t fit them up in something a\nlittle less outlandish than their present rig. Then they can have a look\nround without being mobbed. May I go?’\n\n‘Oh yes, if you like,’ said the Captain, ‘but don’t be all day.’\n\nThe man led them through the dark arch into the town. And it was very\ndifferent from London. For one thing, everything in London seems to be\npatched up out of odds and ends, but these houses seemed to have been\nbuilt by people who liked the same sort of things. Not that they were\nall alike, for though all were squarish, they were of different sizes,\nand decorated in all sorts of different ways, some with paintings in\nbright colours, some with black and silver designs. There were terraces,\nand gardens, and balconies, and open spaces with trees. Their guide took\nthem to a little house in a back street, where a kind-faced woman sat\nspinning at the door of a very dark room.\n\n‘Here,’ he said, ‘just lend these children a mantle each, so that they\ncan go about and see the place till the Queen’s audience begins. You\nleave that wool for a bit, and show them round if you like. I must be\noff now.’\n\nThe woman did as she was told, and the four children, wrapped in fringed\nmantles, went with her all about the town, and oh! how I wish I had time\nto tell you all that they saw. It was all so wonderfully different\nfrom anything you have ever seen. For one thing, all the houses were\ndazzlingly bright, and many of them covered with pictures. Some had\ngreat creatures carved in stone at each side of the door. Then the\npeople--there were no black frock-coats and tall hats; no dingy coats\nand skirts of good, useful, ugly stuffs warranted to wear. Everyone’s\nclothes were bright and beautiful with blue and scarlet and green and\ngold.\n\nThe market was brighter than you would think anything could be. There\nwere stalls for everything you could possibly want--and for a great many\nthings that if you wanted here and now, want would be your master. There\nwere pineapples and peaches in heaps--and stalls of crockery and glass\nthings, beautiful shapes and glorious colours, there were stalls for\nnecklaces, and clasps, and bracelets, and brooches, for woven stuffs,\nand furs, and embroidered linen. The children had never seen half so\nmany beautiful things together, even at Liberty’s. It seemed no time at\nall before the woman said--\n\n‘It’s nearly time now. We ought to be getting on towards the palace.\nIt’s as well to be early.’ So they went to the palace, and when they got\nthere it was more splendid than anything they had seen yet.\n\nFor it was glowing with colours, and with gold and silver and black and\nwhite--like some magnificent embroidery. Flight after flight of broad\nmarble steps led up to it, and at the edges of the stairs stood great\nimages, twenty times as big as a man--images of men with wings like\nchain armour, and hawks’ heads, and winged men with the heads of dogs.\nAnd there were the statues of great kings.\n\nBetween the flights of steps were terraces where fountains played, and\nthe Queen’s Guard in white and scarlet, and armour that shone like gold,\nstood by twos lining the way up the stairs; and a great body of them was\nmassed by the vast door of the palace itself, where it stood glittering\nlike an impossibly radiant peacock in the noon-day sun.\n\nAll sorts of people were passing up the steps to seek audience of the\nQueen. Ladies in richly-embroidered dresses with fringy flounces, poor\nfolks in plain and simple clothes, dandies with beards oiled and curled.\n\nAnd Cyril, Robert, Anthea and Jane, went with the crowd.\n\nAt the gate of the palace the Psammead put one eye cautiously out of the\nbasket and whispered--\n\n‘I can’t be bothered with queens. I’ll go home with this lady. I’m sure\nshe’ll get me some sand if you ask her to.’\n\n‘Oh! don’t leave us,’ said Jane. The woman was giving some last\ninstructions in Court etiquette to Anthea, and did not hear Jane.\n\n‘Don’t be a little muff,’ said the Psammead quite fiercely. ‘It’s not a\nbit of good your having a charm. You never use it. If you want me you’ve\nonly got to say the name of power and ask the charm to bring me to you.’\n\n‘I’d rather go with you,’ said Jane. And it was the most surprising\nthing she had ever said in her life.\n\nEveryone opened its mouth without thinking of manners, and Anthea, who\nwas peeping into the Psammead’s basket, saw that its mouth opened wider\nthan anybody’s.\n\n‘You needn’t gawp like that,’ Jane went on. ‘I’m not going to be\nbothered with queens any more than IT is. And I know, wherever it is,\nit’ll take jolly good care that it’s safe.’\n\n‘She’s right there,’ said everyone, for they had observed that the\nPsammead had a way of knowing which side its bread was buttered.\n\nShe turned to the woman and said, ‘You’ll take me home with you, won’t\nyou? And let me play with your little girls till the others have done\nwith the Queen.’\n\n‘Surely I will, little heart!’ said the woman.\n\nAnd then Anthea hurriedly stroked the Psammead and embraced Jane, who\ntook the woman’s hand, and trotted contentedly away with the Psammead’s\nbag under the other arm.\n\nThe others stood looking after her till she, the woman, and the basket\nwere lost in the many-coloured crowd. Then Anthea turned once more to\nthe palace’s magnificent doorway and said--\n\n‘Let’s ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian overcoats.’\n\nSo they took off the garments that the woman had lent them and stood\namid the jostling petitioners of the Queen in their own English frocks\nand coats and hats and boots.\n\n‘We want to see the Queen,’ said Cyril; ‘we come from the far Empire\nwhere the sun never sets!’\n\nA murmur of surprise and a thrill of excitement ran through the crowd.\nThe door-porter spoke to a black man, he spoke to someone else. There\nwas a whispering, waiting pause. Then a big man, with a cleanly-shaven\nface, beckoned them from the top of a flight of red marble steps.\n\nThey went up; the boots of Robert clattering more than usual because he\nwas so nervous. A door swung open, a curtain was drawn back. A double\nline of bowing forms in gorgeous raiment formed a lane that led to the\nsteps of the throne, and as the children advanced hurriedly there came\nfrom the throne a voice very sweet and kind.\n\n‘Three children from the land where the sun never sets! Let them draw\nhither without fear.’\n\nIn another minute they were kneeling at the throne’s foot, saying,\n‘O Queen, live for ever!’ exactly as the woman had taught them. And a\nsplendid dream-lady, all gold and silver and jewels and snowy drift of\nveils, was raising Anthea, and saying--\n\n‘Don’t be frightened, I really am SO glad you came! The land where\nthe sun never sets! I am delighted to see you! I was getting quite too\ndreadfully bored for anything!’\n\nAnd behind Anthea the kneeling Cyril whispered in the ears of the\nrespectful Robert--\n\n‘Bobs, don’t say anything to Panther. It’s no use upsetting her, but we\ndidn’t ask for Jane’s address, and the Psammead’s with her.’\n\n‘Well,’ whispered Robert, ‘the charm can bring them to us at any moment.\nIT said so.’\n\n‘Oh, yes,’ whispered Cyril, in miserable derision, ‘WE’RE all right, of\ncourse. So we are! Oh, yes! If we’d only GOT the charm.’\n\nThen Robert saw, and he murmured, ‘Crikey!’ at the foot of the throne of\nBabylon; while Cyril hoarsely whispered the plain English fact--\n\n‘Jane’s got the charm round her neck, you silly cuckoo.’\n\n‘Crikey!’ Robert repeated in heart-broken undertones.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. ‘THE DEEPEST DUNGEON BELOW THE CASTLE MOAT’\n\nThe Queen threw three of the red and gold embroidered cushions off the\nthrone on to the marble steps that led up to it.\n\n‘Just make yourselves comfortable there,’ she said. ‘I’m simply dying\nto talk to you, and to hear all about your wonderful country and how you\ngot here, and everything, but I have to do justice every morning. Such a\nbore, isn’t it? Do you do justice in your own country?’\n\n‘No, said Cyril; ‘at least of course we try to, but not in this public\nsort of way, only in private.’ ‘Ah, yes,’ said the Queen, ‘I should\nmuch prefer a private audience myself--much easier to manage. But public\nopinion has to be considered. Doing justice is very hard work, even when\nyou’re brought up to it.’\n\n‘We don’t do justice, but we have to do scales, Jane and me,’ said\nAnthea, ‘twenty minutes a day. It’s simply horrid.’\n\n‘What are scales?’ asked the Queen, ‘and what is Jane?’\n\n‘Jane is my little sister. One of the guards-at-the-gate’s wife is\ntaking care of her. And scales are music.’\n\n‘I never heard of the instrument,’ said the Queen. ‘Do you sing?’\n\n‘Oh, yes. We can sing in parts,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘That IS magic,’ said the Queen. ‘How many parts are you each cut into\nbefore you do it?’\n\n‘We aren’t cut at all,’ said Robert hastily. ‘We couldn’t sing if we\nwere. We’ll show you afterwards.’\n\n‘So you shall, and now sit quiet like dear children and hear me do\njustice. The way I do it has always been admired. I oughtn’t to say that\nought I? Sounds so conceited. But I don’t mind with you, dears. Somehow\nI feel as though I’d known you quite a long time already.’\n\nThe Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her\nattendants. The children, whispering together among the cushions on the\nsteps of the throne, decided that she was very beautiful and very kind,\nbut perhaps just the least bit flighty.\n\nThe first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose brother\nhad taken the money the father had left for her. The brother said it\nwas the uncle who had the money. There was a good deal of talk and the\nchildren were growing rather bored, when the Queen suddenly clapped her\nhands, and said--\n\n‘Put both the men in prison till one of them owns up that the other is\ninnocent.’\n\n‘But suppose they both did it?’ Cyril could not help interrupting.\n\n‘Then prison’s the best place for them,’ said the Queen.\n\n‘But suppose neither did it.’\n\n‘That’s impossible,’ said the Queen; ‘a thing’s not done unless someone\ndoes it. And you mustn’t interrupt.’\n\nThen came a woman, in tears, with a torn veil and real ashes on her\nhead--at least Anthea thought so, but it may have been only road-dust.\nShe complained that her husband was in prison.\n\n‘What for?’ said the Queen.\n\n‘They SAID it was for speaking evil of your Majesty,’ said the woman,\n‘but it wasn’t. Someone had a spite against him. That was what it was.’\n\n‘How do you know he hadn’t spoken evil of me?’ said the Queen.\n\n‘No one could,’ said the woman simply, ‘when they’d once seen your\nbeautiful face.’\n\n‘Let the man out,’ said the Queen, smiling. ‘Next case.’\n\nThe next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox. ‘Like the Spartan\nboy,’ whispered Robert. But the Queen ruled that nobody could have any\npossible reason for owning a fox, and still less for stealing one. And\nshe did not believe that there were any foxes in Babylon; she, at any\nrate, had never seen one. So the boy was released.\n\nThe people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels and\nneighbourly misunderstandings--from a fight between brothers over the\ndivision of an inheritance, to the dishonest and unfriendly conduct of\na woman who had borrowed a cooking-pot at the last New Year’s festival,\nand not returned it yet.\n\nAnd the Queen decided everything, very, very decidedly indeed. At last\nshe clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme loudness, and\nsaid--\n\n‘The audience is over for today.’\n\nEveryone said, ‘May the Queen live for ever!’ and went out.\n\nAnd the children were left alone in the justice-hall with the Queen of\nBabylon and her ladies.\n\n‘There!’ said the Queen, with a long sigh of relief. ‘THAT’S over! I\ncouldn’t have done another stitch of justice if you’d offered me the\ncrown of Egypt! Now come into the garden, and we’ll have a nice, long,\ncosy talk.’\n\nShe led them through long, narrow corridors whose walls they somehow\nfelt, were very, very thick, into a sort of garden courtyard. There were\nthick shrubs closely planted, and roses were trained over trellises, and\nmade a pleasant shade--needed, indeed, for already the sun was as hot as\nit is in England in August at the seaside.\n\nSlaves spread cushions on a low, marble terrace, and a big man with a\nsmooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with beryls. He\ndrank a little from the Queen’s cup before handing it to her.\n\n‘That’s rather a nasty trick,’ whispered Robert, who had been carefully\ntaught never to drink out of one of the nice, shiny, metal cups that are\nchained to the London drinking fountains without first rinsing it out\nthoroughly.\n\nThe Queen overheard him.\n\n‘Not at all,’ said she. ‘Ritti-Marduk is a very clean man. And one has\nto have SOME ONE as taster, you know, because of poison.’\n\nThe word made the children feel rather creepy; but Ritti-Marduk\nhad tasted all the cups, so they felt pretty safe. The drink was\ndelicious--very cold, and tasting like lemonade and partly like penny\nices.\n\n‘Leave us,’ said the Queen. And all the Court ladies, in their\nbeautiful, many-folded, many-coloured, fringed dresses, filed out\nslowly, and the children were left alone with the Queen.\n\n‘Now,’ she said, ‘tell me all about yourselves.’\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n‘You, Bobs,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘No--Anthea,’ said Robert.\n\n‘No--you--Cyril,’ said Anthea. ‘Don’t you remember how pleased the Queen\nof India was when you told her all about us?’\n\nCyril muttered that it was all very well, and so it was. For when he had\ntold the tale of the Phoenix and the Carpet to the Ranee, it had been\nonly the truth--and all the truth that he had to tell. But now it\nwas not easy to tell a convincing story without mentioning the\nAmulet--which, of course, it wouldn’t have done to mention--and without\nowning that they were really living in London, about 2,500 years later\nthan the time they were talking in.\n\nCyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful power of\nmaking wishes come true. The children had never been able to tell anyone\nbefore, and Cyril was surprised to find that the spell which kept them\nsilent in London did not work here. ‘Something to do with our being in\nthe Past, I suppose,’ he said to himself.\n\n‘This is MOST interesting,’ said the Queen. ‘We must have this Psammead\nfor the banquet tonight. Its performance will be one of the most popular\nturns in the whole programme. Where is it?’\n\nAnthea explained that they did not know; also why it was that they did\nnot know.\n\n‘Oh, THAT’S quite simple,’ said the Queen, and everyone breathed a deep\nsigh of relief as she said it.\n\n‘Ritti-Marduk shall run down to the gates and find out which guard your\nsister went home with.’\n\n‘Might he’--Anthea’s voice was tremulous--‘might he--would it interfere\nwith his meal-times, or anything like that, if he went NOW?’\n\n‘Of course he shall go now. He may think himself lucky if he gets his\nmeals at any time,’ said the Queen heartily, and clapped her hands.\n\n‘May I send a letter?’ asked Cyril, pulling out a red-backed penny\naccount-book, and feeling in his pockets for a stump of pencil that he\nknew was in one of them.\n\n‘By all means. I’ll call my scribe.’\n\n‘Oh, I can scribe right enough, thanks,’ said Cyril, finding the pencil\nand licking its point. He even had to bite the wood a little, for it was\nvery blunt.\n\n‘Oh, you clever, clever boy!’ said the Queen. ‘DO let me watch you do\nit!’\n\nCyril wrote on a leaf of the book--it was of rough, woolly paper, with\nhairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had been using\none, and ruled for accounts.\n\n‘Hide IT most carefully before you come here,’ he wrote, ‘and don’t\nmention it--and destroy this letter. Everything is going A1. The Queen\nis a fair treat. There’s nothing to be afraid of.’\n\n‘What curious characters, and what a strange flat surface!’ said the\nQueen. ‘What have you inscribed?’\n\n‘I’ve ‘scribed,’ replied Cyril cautiously, ‘that you are fair, and\na--and like a--like a festival; and that she need not be afraid, and\nthat she is to come at once.’\n\nRitti-Marduk, who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril wrote,\nhis Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish head, now took\nthe letter, with some reluctance.\n\n‘O Queen, live for ever! Is it a charm?’ he timidly asked. ‘A strong\ncharm, most great lady?’\n\n‘YES,’ said Robert, unexpectedly, ‘it IS a charm, but it won’t hurt\nanyone until you’ve given it to Jane. And then she’ll destroy it,\nso that it CAN’T hurt anyone. It’s most awful strong!--as strong\nas--Peppermint!’ he ended abruptly.\n\n‘I know not the god,’ said Ritti-Marduk, bending timorously.\n\n‘She’ll tear it up directly she gets it,’ said Robert, ‘That’ll end the\ncharm. You needn’t be afraid if you go now.’\n\nRitti-Marduk went, seeming only partly satisfied; and then the Queen\nbegan to admire the penny account-book and the bit of pencil in so\nmarked and significant a way that Cyril felt he could not do less than\npress them upon her as a gift. She ruffled the leaves delightedly.\n\n‘What a wonderful substance!’ she said. ‘And with this style you make\ncharms? Make a charm for me! Do you know,’ her voice sank to a whisper,\n‘the names of the great ones of your own far country?’\n\n‘Rather!’ said Cyril, and hastily wrote the names of Alfred the Great,\nShakespeare, Nelson, Gordon, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr Rudyard Kipling, and\nMr Sherlock Holmes, while the Queen watched him with ‘unbaited breath’,\nas Anthea said afterwards.\n\nShe took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of her\ngown.\n\n‘You shall teach me later to say the great names,’ she said. ‘And the\nnames of their Ministers--perhaps the great Nisroch is one of them?’\n\n‘I don’t think so,’ said Cyril. ‘Mr Campbell Bannerman’s Prime Minister\nand Mr Burns a Minister, and so is the Archbishop of Canterbury, I\nthink, but I’m not sure--and Dr Parker was one, I know, and--’\n\n‘No more,’ said the Queen, putting her hands to her ears. ‘My head’s\ngoing round with all those great names. You shall teach them to me\nlater--because of course you’ll make us a nice long visit now you have\ncome, won’t you? Now tell me--but no, I am quite tired out with your\nbeing so clever. Besides, I’m sure you’d like ME to tell YOU something,\nwouldn’t you?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea. ‘I want to know how it is that the King has gone--’\n\n‘Excuse me, but you should say “the King may-he-live-for-ever”,’ said\nthe Queen gently.\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ Anthea hastened to say--‘the King\nmay-he-live-for-ever has gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife? I don’t\nthink even Bluebeard had as many as that. And, besides, he hasn’t killed\nYOU at any rate.’\n\nThe Queen looked bewildered.\n\n‘She means,’ explained Robert, ‘that English kings only have one\nwife--at least, Henry the Eighth had seven or eight, but not all at\nonce.’\n\n‘In our country,’ said the Queen scornfully, ‘a king would not reign\na day who had only one wife. No one would respect him, and quite right\ntoo.’\n\n‘Then are all the other thirteen alive?’ asked Anthea.\n\n‘Of course they are--poor mean-spirited things! I don’t associate with\nthem, of course, I am the Queen: they’re only the wives.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Anthea, gasping.\n\n‘But oh, my dears,’ the Queen went on, ‘such a to-do as there’s been\nabout this last wife! You never did! It really was TOO funny. We wanted\nan Egyptian princess. The King may-he-live-for-ever has got a wife from\nmost of the important nations, and he had set his heart on an Egyptian\none to complete his collection. Well, of course, to begin with, we\nsent a handsome present of gold. The Egyptian king sent back some\nhorses--quite a few; he’s fearfully stingy!--and he said he liked the\ngold very much, but what they were really short of was lapis lazuli, so\nof course we sent him some. But by that time he’d begun to use the gold\nto cover the beams of the roof of the Temple of the Sun-God, and he\nhadn’t nearly enough to finish the job, so we sent some more. And so it\nwent on, oh, for years. You see each journey takes at least six months.\nAnd at last we asked the hand of his daughter in marriage.’\n\n‘Yes, and then?’ said Anthea, who wanted to get to the princess part of\nthe story.\n\n‘Well, then,’ said the Queen, ‘when he’d got everything out of us that\nhe could, and only given the meanest presents in return, he sent to\nsay he would esteem the honour of an alliance very highly, only\nunfortunately he hadn’t any daughter, but he hoped one would be born\nsoon, and if so, she should certainly be reserved for the King of\nBabylon!’\n\n‘What a trick!’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Yes, wasn’t it? So then we said his sister would do, and then there\nwere more gifts and more journeys; and now at last the tiresome,\nblack-haired thing is coming, and the King may-he-live-for-ever has gone\nseven days’ journey to meet her at Carchemish. And he’s gone in his best\nchariot, the one inlaid with lapis lazuli and gold, with the gold-plated\nwheels and onyx-studded hubs--much too great an honour in my opinion.\nShe’ll be here tonight; there’ll be a grand banquet to celebrate her\narrival. SHE won’t be present, of course. She’ll be having her baths and\nher anointings, and all that sort of thing. We always clean our foreign\nbrides very carefully. It takes two or three weeks. Now it’s dinnertime,\nand you shall eat with me, for I can see that you are of high rank.’\nShe led them into a dark, cool hall, with many cushions on the floor. On\nthese they sat and low tables were brought--beautiful tables of smooth,\nblue stone mounted in gold. On these, golden trays were placed; but\nthere were no knives, or forks, or spoons. The children expected the\nQueen to call for them; but no. She just ate with her fingers, and as\nthe first dish was a great tray of boiled corn, and meat and raisins all\nmixed up together, and melted fat poured all over the tray, it was found\ndifficult to follow her example with anything like what we are used to\nthink of as good table manners. There were stewed quinces afterwards,\nand dates in syrup, and thick yellowy cream. It was the kind of dinner\nyou hardly ever get in Fitzroy Street.\n\nAfter dinner everybody went to sleep, even the children.\n\nThe Queen awoke with a start.\n\n‘Good gracious!’ she cried, ‘what a time we’ve slept! I must rush off\nand dress for the banquet. I shan’t have much more than time.’\n\n‘Hasn’t Ritti-Marduk got back with our sister and the Psammead yet?’\nAnthea asked.\n\n‘I QUITE forgot to ask. I’m sorry,’ said the Queen. ‘And of course\nthey wouldn’t announce her unless I told them to, except during justice\nhours. I expect she’s waiting outside. I’ll see.’\n\nRitti-Marduk came in a moment later.\n\n‘I regret,’ he said, ‘that I have been unable to find your sister. The\nbeast she bears with her in a basket has bitten the child of the guard,\nand your sister and the beast set out to come to you. The police say\nthey have a clue. No doubt we shall have news of her in a few weeks.’ He\nbowed and withdrew.\n\nThe horror of this threefold loss--Jane, the Psammead, and the\nAmulet--gave the children something to talk about while the Queen was\ndressing. I shall not report their conversation; it was very gloomy.\nEveryone repeated himself several times, and the discussion ended in\neach of them blaming the other two for having let Jane go. You know the\nsort of talk it was, don’t you? At last Cyril said--\n\n‘After all, she’s with the Psammead, so SHE’S all right. The Psammead is\njolly careful of itself too. And it isn’t as if we were in any danger.\nLet’s try to buck up and enjoy the banquet.’\n\nThey did enjoy the banquet. They had a beautiful bath, which was\ndelicious, were heavily oiled all over, including their hair, and that\nwas most unpleasant. Then, they dressed again and were presented to the\nKing, who was most affable. The banquet was long; there were all sorts\nof nice things to eat, and everybody seemed to eat and drink a good\ndeal. Everyone lay on cushions and couches, ladies on one side and\ngentlemen on the other; and after the eating was done each lady went and\nsat by some gentleman, who seemed to be her sweetheart or her husband,\nfor they were very affectionate to each other. The Court dresses had\ngold threads woven in them, very bright and beautiful.\n\nThe middle of the room was left clear, and different people came and did\namusing things. There were conjurers and jugglers and snake-charmers,\nwhich last Anthea did not like at all.\n\nWhen it got dark torches were lighted. Cedar splinters dipped in oil\nblazed in copper dishes set high on poles.\n\nThen there was a dancer, who hardly danced at all, only just struck\nattitudes. She had hardly any clothes, and was not at all pretty. The\nchildren were rather bored by her, but everyone else was delighted,\nincluding the King.\n\n‘By the beard of Nimrod!’ he cried, ‘ask what you like girl, and you\nshall have it!’\n\n‘I want nothing,’ said the dancer; ‘the honour of having pleased the\nKing may-he-live-for-ever is reward enough for me.’\n\nAnd the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply that he\ngave her the gold collar off his own neck.\n\n‘I say!’ said Cyril, awed by the magnificence of the gift.\n\n‘It’s all right,’ whispered the Queen, ‘it’s not his best collar by any\nmeans. We always keep a stock of cheap jewellery for these occasions.\nAnd now--you promised to sing us something. Would you like my minstrels\nto accompany you?’\n\n‘No, thank you,’ said Anthea quickly. The minstrels had been playing off\nand on all the time, and their music reminded Anthea of the band she and\nthe others had once had on the fifth of November--with penny horns,\na tin whistle, a tea-tray, the tongs, a policeman’s rattle, and a toy\ndrum. They had enjoyed this band very much at the time. But it was quite\ndifferent when someone else was making the same kind of music.\nAnthea understood now that Father had not been really heartless and\nunreasonable when he had told them to stop that infuriating din.\n\n‘What shall we sing?’ Cyril was asking.\n\n‘Sweet and low?’ suggested Anthea.\n\n‘Too soft--I vote for “Who will o’er the downs”. Now then--one, two,\nthree.\n\n   ‘Oh, who will o’er the downs so free,\n   Oh, who will with me ride,\n   Oh, who will up and follow me,\n   To win a blooming bride?\n\n   Her father he has locked the door,\n   Her mother keeps the key;\n   But neither bolt nor bar shall keep\n   My own true love from me.’\n\nJane, the alto, was missing, and Robert, unlike the mother of the lady\nin the song, never could ‘keep the key’, but the song, even so, was\nsufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard to rouse the\nBabylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm.\n\n‘More, more,’ cried the King; ‘by my beard, this savage music is a new\nthing. Sing again!’\n\nSo they sang:\n\n   ‘I saw her bower at twilight gray,\n   ‘Twas guarded safe and sure.\n   I saw her bower at break of day,\n   ‘Twas guarded then no more.\n\n   The varlets they were all asleep,\n   And there was none to see\n   The greeting fair that passed there\n   Between my love and me.’\n\nShouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse, and the King would\nnot be satisfied till they had sung all their part-songs (they only knew\nthree) twice over, and ended up with ‘Men of Harlech’ in unison. Then\nthe King stood up in his royal robes with his high, narrow crown on his\nhead and shouted--\n\n‘By the beak of Nisroch, ask what you will, strangers from the land\nwhere the sun never sets!’\n\n‘We ought to say it’s enough honour, like the dancer did,’ whispered\nAnthea.\n\n‘No, let’s ask for IT,’ said Robert.\n\n‘No, no, I’m sure the other’s manners,’ said Anthea. But Robert, who was\nexcited by the music, and the flaring torches, and the applause and the\nopportunity, spoke up before the others could stop him.\n\n‘Give us the half of the Amulet that has on it the name UR HEKAU\nSETCHEH,’ he said, adding as an afterthought, ‘O King, live-for-ever.’\n\nAs he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their\nfaces, and lay still. All but the Queen who crouched amid her cushions\nwith her head in her hands, and the King, who stood upright, perfectly\nstill, like the statue of a king in stone. It was only for a moment\nthough. Then his great voice thundered out--\n\n‘Guard, seize them!’\n\nInstantly, from nowhere as it seemed, sprang eight soldiers in bright\narmour inlaid with gold, and tunics of red and white. Very splendid they\nwere, and very alarming.\n\n‘Impious and sacrilegious wretches!’ shouted the King. ‘To the dungeons\nwith them! We will find a way, tomorrow, to make them speak. For without\ndoubt they can tell us where to find the lost half of It.’\n\nA wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round the\nchildren and hurried them away among the many pillars of the great hall.\nAs they went they heard the voices of the courtiers loud in horror.\n\n‘You’ve done it this time,’ said Cyril with extreme bitterness.\n\n‘Oh, it will come right. It MUST. It always does,’ said Anthea\ndesperately.\n\nThey could not see where they were going, because the guard surrounded\nthem so closely, but the ground under their feet, smooth marble at\nfirst, grew rougher like stone, then it was loose earth and sand, and\nthey felt the night air. Then there was more stone, and steps down.\n\n‘It’s my belief we really ARE going to the deepest dungeon below the\ncastle moat this time,’ said Cyril.\n\nAnd they were. At least it was not below a moat, but below the river\nEuphrates, which was just as bad if not worse. In a most unpleasant\nplace it was. Dark, very, very damp, and with an odd, musty smell rather\nlike the shells of oysters. There was a torch--that is to say, a copper\nbasket on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it. By its light the\nchildren saw that the walls were green, and that trickles of water ran\ndown them and dripped from the roof. There were things on the floor that\nlooked like newts, and in the dark corners creepy, shiny things moved\nsluggishly, uneasily, horribly.\n\nRobert’s heart sank right into those really reliable boots of\nhis. Anthea and Cyril each had a private struggle with that inside\ndisagreeableness which is part of all of us, and which is sometimes\ncalled the Old Adam--and both were victors. Neither of them said to\nRobert (and both tried hard not even to think it), ‘This is YOUR doing.’\nAnthea had the additional temptation to add, ‘I told you so.’ And she\nresisted it successfully.\n\n‘Sacrilege, and impious cheek,’ said the captain of the guard to the\ngaoler. ‘To be kept during the King’s pleasure. I expect he means to get\nsome pleasure out of them tomorrow! He’ll tickle them up!’\n\n‘Poor little kids,’ said the gaoler.\n\n‘Oh, yes,’ said the captain. ‘I’ve got kids of my own too. But it\ndoesn’t do to let domestic sentiment interfere with one’s public duties.\nGood night.’\n\nThe soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and\ngold. The gaoler, with a bunch of big keys in his hand, stood looking\npityingly at the children. He shook his head twice and went out.\n\n‘Courage!’ said Anthea. ‘I know it will be all right. It’s only a dream\nREALLY, you know. It MUST be! I don’t believe about time being only a\nsomething or other of thought. It IS a dream, and we’re bound to wake up\nall right and safe.’\n\n‘Humph,’ said Cyril bitterly. And Robert suddenly said--\n\n‘It’s all my doing. If it really IS all up do please not keep a down on\nme about it, and tell Father--Oh, I forgot.’\n\nWhat he had forgotten was that his father was 3,000 miles and 5,000 or\nmore years away from him.\n\n‘All right, Bobs, old man,’ said Cyril; and Anthea got hold of Robert’s\nhand and squeezed it.\n\nThen the gaoler came back with a platter of hard, flat cakes made of\ncoarse grain, very different from the cream-and-juicy-date feasts of the\npalace; also a pitcher of water.\n\n‘There,’ he said.\n\n‘Oh, thank you so very much. You ARE kind,’ said Anthea feverishly.\n\n‘Go to sleep,’ said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw in a corner;\n‘tomorrow comes soon enough.’\n\n‘Oh, dear Mr Gaoler,’ said Anthea, ‘whatever will they do to us\ntomorrow?’\n\n‘They’ll try to make you tell things,’ said the gaoler grimly, ‘and my\nadvice is if you’ve nothing to tell, make up something. Then perhaps\nthey’ll sell you to the Northern nations. Regular savages THEY are. Good\nnight.’\n\n‘Good night,’ said three trembling voices, which their owners strove in\nvain to render firm. Then he went out, and the three were left alone in\nthe damp, dim vault.\n\n‘I know the light won’t last long,’ said Cyril, looking at the\nflickering brazier.\n\n‘Is it any good, do you think, calling on the name when we haven’t got\nthe charm?’ suggested Anthea.\n\n‘I shouldn’t think so. But we might try.’\n\nSo they tried. But the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained\nunchanged.\n\n‘What was the name the Queen said?’ asked Cyril suddenly.\n‘Nisbeth--Nesbit--something? You know, the slave of the great names?’\n\n‘Wait a sec,’ said Robert, ‘though I don’t know why you want it.\nNusroch--Nisrock--Nisroch--that’s it.’\n\nThen Anthea pulled herself together. All her muscles tightened, and the\nmuscles of her mind and soul, if you can call them that, tightened too.\n\n‘UR HEKAU SETCHEH,’ she cried in a fervent voice. ‘Oh, Nisroch, servant\nof the Great Ones, come and help us!’\n\nThere was a waiting silence. Then a cold, blue light awoke in the corner\nwhere the straw was--and in the light they saw coming towards them a\nstrange and terrible figure. I won’t try to describe it, because the\ndrawing shows it, exactly as it was, and exactly as the old Babylonians\ncarved it on their stones, so that you can see it in our own British\nMuseum at this day. I will just say that it had eagle’s wings and an\neagle’s head and the body of a man.\n\nIt came towards them, strong and unspeakably horrible.\n\n‘Oh, go away,’ cried Anthea; but Cyril cried, ‘No; stay!’\n\nThe creature hesitated, then bowed low before them on the damp floor of\nthe dungeon.\n\n‘Speak,’ it said, in a harsh, grating voice like large rusty keys being\nturned in locks. ‘The servant of the Great Ones is YOUR servant. What is\nyour need that you call on the name of Nisroch?’\n\n‘We want to go home,’ said Robert.\n\n‘No, no,’ cried Anthea; ‘we want to be where Jane is.’\n\nNisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon.\nAnd, as he pointed, the wall disappeared, and instead of the damp,\ngreen, rocky surface, there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings\nof red silk embroidered with golden water-lilies, with cushioned couches\nand great mirrors of polished steel; and in it was the Queen, and\nbefore her, on a red pillow, sat the Psammead, its fur hunched up in\nan irritated, discontented way. On a blue-covered couch lay Jane fast\nasleep.\n\n‘Walk forward without fear,’ said Nisroch. ‘Is there aught else that the\nServant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?’\n\n‘No--oh, no,’ said Cyril. ‘It’s all right now. Thanks ever so.’\n\n‘You are a dear,’ cried Anthea, not in the least knowing what she was\nsaying. ‘Oh, thank you thank you. But DO go NOW!’\n\nShe caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in hers,\nlike a hand of stone.\n\n‘Go forward,’ said Nisroch. And they went.\n\n\n‘Oh, my good gracious,’ said the Queen as they stood before her. ‘How\ndid you get here? I KNEW you were magic. I meant to let you out the\nfirst thing in the morning, if I could slip away--but thanks be to\nDagon, you’ve managed it for yourselves. You must get away. I’ll wake\nmy chief lady and she shall call Ritti-Marduk, and he’ll let you out the\nback way, and--’\n\n‘Don’t rouse anybody for goodness’ sake,’ said Anthea, ‘except Jane, and\nI’ll rouse her.’\n\nShe shook Jane with energy, and Jane slowly awoke.\n\n‘Ritti-Marduk brought them in hours ago, really,’ said the Queen, ‘but\nI wanted to have the Psammead all to myself for a bit. You’ll excuse the\nlittle natural deception?--it’s part of the Babylonish character, don’t\nyou know? But I don’t want anything to happen to you. Do let me rouse\nsomeone.’\n\n‘No, no, no,’ said Anthea with desperate earnestness. She thought she\nknew enough of what the Babylonians were like when they were roused.\n‘We can go by our own magic. And you will tell the King it wasn’t the\ngaoler’s fault. It was Nisroch.’\n\n‘Nisroch!’ echoed the Queen. ‘You are indeed magicians.’\n\nJane sat up, blinking stupidly.\n\n‘Hold It up, and say the word,’ cried Cyril, catching up the Psammead,\nwhich mechanically bit him, but only very slightly.\n\n‘Which is the East?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘Behind me,’ said the Queen. ‘Why?’\n\n‘Ur Hekau Setcheh,’ said Jane sleepily, and held up the charm.\n\nAnd there they all were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street.\n\n‘Jane,’ cried Cyril with great presence of mind, ‘go and get the plate\nof sand down for the Psammead.’\n\nJane went.\n\n‘Look here!’ he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew less loud\non the stairs, ‘don’t let’s tell her about the dungeon and all that.\nIt’ll only frighten her so that she’ll never want to go anywhere else.’\n\n‘Righto!’ said Cyril; but Anthea felt that she could not have said a\nword to save her life.\n\n‘Why did you want to come back in such a hurry?’ asked Jane, returning\nwith the plate of sand. ‘It was awfully jolly in Babylon, I think! I\nliked it no end.’\n\n‘Oh, yes,’ said Cyril carelessly. ‘It was jolly enough, of course, but I\nthought we’d been there long enough. Mother always says you oughtn’t to\nwear out your welcome!’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. THE QUEEN IN LONDON\n\n‘Now tell us what happened to you,’ said Cyril to Jane, when he and the\nothers had told her all about the Queen’s talk and the banquet, and the\nvariety entertainment, carefully stopping short before the beginning of\nthe dungeon part of the story.\n\n‘It wasn’t much good going,’ said Jane, ‘if you didn’t even try to get\nthe Amulet.’\n\n‘We found out it was no go,’ said Cyril; ‘it’s not to be got in Babylon.\nIt was lost before that. We’ll go to some other jolly friendly place,\nwhere everyone is kind and pleasant, and look for it there. Now tell us\nabout your part.’\n\n‘Oh,’ said Jane, ‘the Queen’s man with the smooth face--what was his\nname?’\n\n‘Ritti-Marduk,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Jane, ‘Ritti-Marduk, he came for me just after the Psammead\nhad bitten the guard-of-the-gate’s wife’s little boy, and he took me to\nthe Palace. And we had supper with the new little Queen from Egypt. She\nis a dear--not much older than you. She told me heaps about Egypt. And\nwe played ball after supper. And then the Babylon Queen sent for me. I\nlike her too. And she talked to the Psammead and I went to sleep. And\nthen you woke me up. That’s all.’\n\nThe Psammead, roused from its sound sleep, told the same story.\n\n‘But,’ it added, ‘what possessed you to tell that Queen that I could\ngive wishes? I sometimes think you were born without even the most\nrudimentary imitation of brains.’\n\nThe children did not know the meaning of rudimentary, but it sounded a\nrude, insulting word.\n\n‘I don’t see that we did any harm,’ said Cyril sulkily.\n\n‘Oh, no,’ said the Psammead with withering irony, ‘not at all! Of course\nnot! Quite the contrary! Exactly so! Only she happened to wish that she\nmight soon find herself in your country. And soon may mean any moment.’\n\n‘Then it’s your fault,’ said Robert, ‘because you might just as well\nhave made “soon” mean some moment next year or next century.’\n\n‘That’s where you, as so often happens, make the mistake,’ rejoined the\nSand-fairy. ‘_I_ couldn’t mean anything but what SHE meant by “soon”. It\nwasn’t my wish. And what SHE meant was the next time the King happens to\ngo out lion hunting. So she’ll have a whole day, and perhaps two, to\ndo as she wishes with. SHE doesn’t know about time only being a mode of\nthought.’\n\n‘Well,’ said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation, ‘we must do what we can\nto give her a good time. She was jolly decent to us. I say, suppose we\nwere to go to St James’s Park after dinner and feed those ducks that we\nnever did feed. After all that Babylon and all those years ago, I\nfeel as if I should like to see something REAL, and NOW. You’ll come,\nPsammead?’\n\n‘Where’s my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes?’ asked the Psammead\nmorosely. ‘I can’t go out with nothing on. And I won’t, what’s more.’\n\nAnd then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had, in the\nhurry of departure from Babylon, not been remembered.\n\n‘But it’s not so extra precious,’ said Robert hastily. ‘You can get them\ngiven to you for nothing if you buy fish in Farringdon Market.’\n\n‘Oh,’ said the Psammead very crossly indeed, ‘so you presume on my\nsublime indifference to the things of this disgusting modern world, to\nfob me off with a travelling equipage that costs you nothing. Very well,\nI shall go to sand. Please don’t wake me.’\n\nAnd it went then and there to sand, which, as you know, meant to bed.\nThe boys went to St James’s Park to feed the ducks, but they went alone.\n\nAnthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon. They cut off half a yard\nfrom each of their best green Liberty sashes. A towel cut in two formed\na lining; and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed. What they were\nmaking was a bag for the Psammead. Each worked at a half of the bag.\njane’s half had four-leaved shamrocks embroidered on it. They were the\nonly things she could do (because she had been taught how at school,\nand, fortunately, some of the silk she had been taught with was left\nover). And even so, Anthea had to draw the pattern for her. Anthea’s\nside of the bag had letters on it--worked hastily but affectionately in\nchain stitch. They were something like this:\n\nPSAMS TRAVEL CAR\n\nShe would have put ‘travelling carriage’, but she made the letters too\nbig, so there was no room. The bag was made INTO a bag with old Nurse’s\nsewing machine, and the strings of it were Anthea’s and Jane’s best\nred hair ribbons. At tea-time, when the boys had come home with a most\nunfavourable report of the St james’s Park ducks, Anthea ventured to\nawaken the Psammead, and to show it its new travelling bag.\n\n‘Humph,’ it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at the same time\naffectionately, ‘it’s not so dusty.’\n\nThe Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that\npeople said nowadays. For a creature that had in its time associated\nwith Megatheriums and Pterodactyls, its quickness was really wonderful.\n\n‘It’s more worthy of me,’ it said, ‘than the kind of bag that’s given\naway with a pound of plaice. When do you propose to take me out in it?’\n\n‘I should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere,’ said Cyril. But\nJane said--\n\n‘I want to go to Egypt. I did like that Egyptian Princess that came\nto marry the King in Babylon. She told me about the larks they have in\nEgypt. And the cats. Do let’s go there. And I told her what the bird\nthings on the Amulet were like. And she said it was Egyptian writing.’\n\nThe others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their\ncleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors they had suffered\nin the dungeon below the Euphrates.\n\n‘Egypt’s so nice too,’ Jane went on, ‘because of Doctor Brewer’s\nScripture History. I would like to go there when Joseph was dreaming\nthose curious dreams, or when Moses was doing wonderful things with\nsnakes and sticks.’\n\n‘I don’t care about snakes,’ said Anthea shuddering.\n\n‘Well, we needn’t be in at that part, but Babylon was lovely! We had\ncream and sweet, sticky stuff. And I expect Egypt’s the same.’\n\nThere was a good deal of discussion, but it all ended in everybody’s\nagreeing to Jane’s idea. And next morning directly after breakfast\n(which was kippers and very nice) the Psammead was invited to get into\nhis travelling carriage.\n\nThe moment after it had done so, with stiff, furry reluctance, like that\nof a cat when you want to nurse it, and its ideas are not the same as\nyours, old Nurse came in.\n\n‘Well, chickies,’ she said, ‘are you feeling very dull?’\n\n‘Oh, no, Nurse dear,’ said Anthea; ‘we’re having a lovely time. We’re\njust going off to see some old ancient relics.’\n\n‘Ah,’ said old Nurse, ‘the Royal Academy, I suppose? Don’t go wasting\nyour money too reckless, that’s all.’\n\nShe cleared away the kipper bones and the tea-things, and when she had\nswept up the crumbs and removed the cloth, the Amulet was held up and\nthe order given--just as Duchesses (and other people) give it to their\ncoachmen.\n\n‘To Egypt, please!’ said Anthea, when Cyril had uttered the wonderful\nName of Power.\n\n‘When Moses was there,’ added Jane.\n\nAnd there, in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining-room, the Amulet grew\nbig, and it was an arch, and through it they saw a blue, blue sky and a\nrunning river.\n\n‘No, stop!’ said Cyril, and pulled down jane’s hand with the Amulet in\nit.\n\n‘What silly cuckoos we all are,’ he said. ‘Of course we can’t go. We\ndaren’t leave home for a single minute now, for fear that minute should\nbe THE minute.’\n\n‘What minute be WHAT minute?’ asked Jane impatiently, trying to get her\nhand away from Cyril.\n\n‘The minute when the Queen of Babylon comes,’ said Cyril. And then\neveryone saw it.\n\n\nFor some days life flowed in a very slow, dusty, uneventful stream.\n\nThe children could never go out all at once, because they never knew\nwhen the King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his Queen\nfree to pay them that surprise visit to which she was, without doubt,\neagerly looking forward.\n\nSo they took it in turns, two and two, to go out and to stay in.\n\nThe stay-at-homes would have been much duller than they were but for the\nnew interest taken in them by the learned gentleman.\n\nHe called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple\nand gold beads.\n\n‘I saw one like that,’ she said, ‘in--’\n\n‘In the British Museum, perhaps?’\n\n‘I like to call the place where I saw it Babylon,’ said Anthea\ncautiously.\n\n‘A pretty fancy,’ said the learned gentleman, ‘and quite correct too,\nbecause, as a matter of fact, these beads did come from Babylon.’ The\nother three were all out that day. The boys had been going to the Zoo,\nand Jane had said so plaintively, ‘I’m sure I am fonder of rhinoceroses\nthan either of you are,’ that Anthea had told her to run along then.\nAnd she had run, catching the boys before that part of the road where\nFitzroy Street suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square.\n\n‘I think Babylon is most frightfully interesting,’ said Anthea. ‘I do\nhave such interesting dreams about it--at least, not dreams exactly, but\nquite as wonderful.’\n\n‘Do sit down and tell me,’ said he. So she sat down and told. And he\nasked her a lot of questions, and she answered them as well as she\ncould.\n\n‘Wonderful--wonderful!’ he said at last. ‘One’s heard of\nthought-transference, but I never thought _I_ had any power of that\nsort. Yet it must be that, and very bad for YOU, I should think. Doesn’t\nyour head ache very much?’\n\nHe suddenly put a cold, thin hand on her forehead.\n\n‘No thank you, not at all,’ said she.\n\n‘I assure you it is not done intentionally,’ he went on. ‘Of course I\nknow a good deal about Babylon, and I unconsciously communicate it to\nyou; you’ve heard of thought-reading, but some of the things you say,\nI don’t understand; they never enter my head, and yet they’re so\nastoundingly probable.’\n\n‘It’s all right,’ said Anthea reassuringly. ‘_I_ understand. And don’t\nworry. It’s all quite simple really.’\n\nIt was not quite so simple when Anthea, having heard the others come\nin, went down, and before she had had time to ask how they had liked the\nZoo, heard a noise outside, compared to which the wild beasts’ noises\nwere gentle as singing birds.\n\n‘Good gracious!’ cried Anthea, ‘what’s that?’\n\nThe loud hum of many voices came through the open window. Words could be\ndistinguished.\n\n‘’Ere’s a guy!’\n\n‘This ain’t November. That ain’t no guy. It’s a ballet lady, that’s what\nit is.’\n\n‘Not it--it’s a bloomin’ looney, I tell you.’\n\nThen came a clear voice that they knew.\n\n‘Retire, slaves!’ it said.\n\n‘What’s she a saying of?’ cried a dozen voices. ‘Some blamed foreign\nlingo,’ one voice replied.\n\nThe children rushed to the door. A crowd was on the road and pavement.\n\nIn the middle of the crowd, plainly to be seen from the top of the\nsteps, were the beautiful face and bright veil of the Babylonian Queen.\n\n‘Jimminy!’ cried Robert, and ran down the steps, ‘here she is!’\n\n‘Here!’ he cried, ‘look out--let the lady pass. She’s a friend of ours,\ncoming to see us.’\n\n‘Nice friend for a respectable house,’ snorted a fat woman with marrows\non a handcart.\n\nAll the same the crowd made way a little. The Queen met Robert on the\npavement, and Cyril joined them, the Psammead bag still on his arm.\n\n‘Here,’ he whispered; ‘here’s the Psammead; you can get wishes.’\n\n‘_I_ wish you’d come in a different dress, if you HAD to come,’ said\nRobert; ‘but it’s no use my wishing anything.’\n\n‘No,’ said the Queen. ‘I wish I was dressed--no, I don’t--I wish THEY\nwere dressed properly, then they wouldn’t be so silly.’\n\nThe Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it;\nand suddenly every man, woman, and child in that crowd felt that it had\nnot enough clothes on. For, of course, the Queen’s idea of proper dress\nwas the dress that had been proper for the working-classes 3,000 years\nago in Babylon--and there was not much of it.\n\n‘Lawky me!’ said the marrow-selling woman, ‘whatever could a-took me\nto come out this figure?’ and she wheeled her cart away very quickly\nindeed.\n\n‘Someone’s made a pretty guy of you--talk of guys,’ said a man who sold\nbootlaces.\n\n‘Well, don’t you talk,’ said the man next to him. ‘Look at your own\nsilly legs; and where’s your boots?’\n\n‘I never come out like this, I’ll take my sacred,’ said the\nbootlace-seller. ‘I wasn’t quite myself last night, I’ll own, but not to\ndress up like a circus.’\n\nThe crowd was all talking at once, and getting rather angry. But no one\nseemed to think of blaming the Queen.\n\nAnthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up; the others followed,\nand the door was shut. ‘Blowed if I can make it out!’ they heard. ‘I’m\noff home, I am.’\n\nAnd the crowd, coming slowly to the same mind, dispersed, followed by\nanother crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the Queen thought\nwas the proper way.\n\n‘We shall have the police here directly,’ said Anthea in the tones of\ndespair. ‘Oh, why did you come dressed like that?’\n\nThe Queen leaned against the arm of the horse-hair sofa.\n\n‘How else can a queen dress I should like to know?’ she questioned.\n\n‘Our Queen wears things like other people,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Well, I don’t. And I must say,’ she remarked in an injured tone, ‘that\nyou don’t seem very glad to see me now I HAVE come. But perhaps it’s the\nsurprise that makes you behave like this. Yet you ought to be used to\nsurprises. The way you vanished! I shall never forget it. The best magic\nI’ve ever seen. How did you do it?’\n\n‘Oh, never mind about that now,’ said Robert. ‘You see you’ve gone and\nupset all those people, and I expect they’ll fetch the police. And we\ndon’t want to see you collared and put in prison.’\n\n‘You can’t put queens in prison,’ she said loftily. ‘Oh, can’t you?’\nsaid Cyril. ‘We cut off a king’s head here once.’\n\n‘In this miserable room? How frightfully interesting.’\n\n‘No, no, not in this room; in history.’\n\n‘Oh, in THAT,’ said the Queen disparagingly. ‘I thought you’d done it\nwith your own hands.’\n\nThe girls shuddered.\n\n‘What a hideous city yours is,’ the Queen went on pleasantly, ‘and what\nhorrid, ignorant people. Do you know they actually can’t understand a\nsingle word I say.’\n\n‘Can you understand them?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘Of course not; they speak some vulgar, Northern dialect. I can\nunderstand YOU quite well.’\n\nI really am not going to explain AGAIN how it was that the children\ncould understand other languages than their own so thoroughly, and talk\nthem, too, so that it felt and sounded (to them) just as though they\nwere talking English.\n\n‘Well,’ said Cyril bluntly, ‘now you’ve seen just how horrid it is,\ndon’t you think you might as well go home again?’ ‘Why, I’ve seen simply\nnothing yet,’ said the Queen, arranging her starry veil. ‘I wished to be\nat your door, and I was. Now I must go and see your King and Queen.’\n\n‘Nobody’s allowed to,’ said Anthea in haste; ‘but look here, we’ll take\nyou and show you anything you’d like to see--anything you CAN see,’ she\nadded kindly, because she remembered how nice the Queen had been to them\nin Babylon, even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter of\nJane and Psammead.\n\n‘There’s the Museum,’ said Cyril hopefully; ‘there are lots of things\nfrom your country there. If only we could disguise you a little.’\n\n‘I know,’ said Anthea suddenly. ‘Mother’s old theatre cloak, and there\nare a lot of her old hats in the big box.’\n\nThe blue silk, lace-trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the Queen’s\nstartling splendours, but the hat fitted very badly. It had pink roses\nin it; and there was something about the coat or the hat or the Queen,\nthat made her look somehow not very respectable.\n\n‘Oh, never mind,’ said Anthea, when Cyril whispered this. ‘The thing is\nto get her out before Nurse has finished her forty winks. I should think\nshe’s about got to the thirty-ninth wink by now.’\n\n‘Come on then,’ said Robert. ‘You know how dangerous it is. Let’s make\nhaste into the Museum. If any of those people you made guys of do fetch\nthe police, they won’t think of looking for you there.’\n\nThe blue silk coat and the pink-rosed hat attracted almost as much\nattention as the royal costume had done; and the children were\nuncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of\nthe Museum.\n\n‘Parcels and umbrellas to be left here,’ said a man at the counter.\n\nThe party had no umbrellas, and the only parcel was the bag containing\nthe Psammead, which the Queen had insisted should be brought.\n\n‘I’M not going to be left,’ said the Psammead softly, ‘so don’t you\nthink it.’\n\n‘I’ll wait outside with you,’ said Anthea hastily, and went to sit on\nthe seat near the drinking fountain.\n\n‘Don’t sit so near that nasty fountain,’ said the creature crossly; ‘I\nmight get splashed.’\n\nAnthea obediently moved to another seat and waited. Indeed she waited,\nand waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The Psammead dropped\ninto an uneasy slumber. Anthea had long ceased to watch the swing-door\nthat always let out the wrong person, and she was herself almost asleep,\nand still the others did not come back.\n\nIt was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they HAD come\nback, and that they were not alone. Behind them was quite a crowd of\nmen in uniform, and several gentlemen were there. Everyone seemed very\nangry.\n\n‘Now go,’ said the nicest of the angry gentlemen. ‘Take the poor,\ndemented thing home and tell your parents she ought to be properly\nlooked after.’\n\n‘If you can’t get her to go we must send for the police,’ said the\nnastiest gentleman.\n\n‘But we don’t wish to use harsh measures,’ added the nice one, who was\nreally very nice indeed, and seemed to be over all the others.\n\n‘May I speak to my sister a moment first?’ asked Robert.\n\nThe nicest gentleman nodded, and the officials stood round the Queen,\nthe others forming a sort of guard while Robert crossed over to Anthea.\n\n‘Everything you can think of,’ he replied to Anthea’s glance of inquiry.\n‘Kicked up the most frightful shine in there. Said those necklaces and\nearrings and things in the glass cases were all hers--would have them\nout of the cases. Tried to break the glass--she did break one bit!\nEverybody in the place has been at her. No good. I only got her out by\ntelling her that was the place where they cut queens’ heads off.’\n\n‘Oh, Bobs, what a whacker!’\n\n‘You’d have told a whackinger one to get her out. Besides, it wasn’t. I\nmeant MUMMY queens. How do you know they don’t cut off mummies’ heads to\nsee how the embalming is done? What I want to say is, can’t you get her\nto go with you quietly?’\n\n‘I’ll try,’ said Anthea, and went up to the Queen.\n\n‘Do come home,’ she said; ‘the learned gentleman in our house has a much\nnicer necklace than anything they’ve got here. Come and see it.’\n\nThe Queen nodded.\n\n‘You see,’ said the nastiest gentleman, ‘she does understand English.’\n\n‘I was talking Babylonian, I think,’ said Anthea bashfully.\n\n‘My good child,’ said the nice gentleman, ‘what you’re talking is\nnot Babylonian, but nonsense. You just go home at once, and tell your\nparents exactly what has happened.’\n\nAnthea took the Queen’s hand and gently pulled her away. The other\nchildren followed, and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the\nsteps watching them. It was when the little party of disgraced children,\nwith the Queen who had disgraced them, had reached the middle of the\ncourtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the Psammead was. She\nstopped short.\n\n‘I wish,’ she said, very loud and clear, ‘that all those Babylonian\nthings would come out to me here--slowly, so that those dogs and slaves\ncan see the working of the great Queen’s magic.’\n\n‘Oh, you ARE a tiresome woman,’ said the Psammead in its bag, but it\npuffed itself out.\n\nNext moment there was a crash. The glass swing doors and all their\nframework were smashed suddenly and completely. The crowd of angry\ngentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this.\n\nBut the nastiest of them was not quick enough, and he was roughly pushed\nout of the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily\nthrough the door. It came and stood beside the Queen in the middle of\nthe courtyard.\n\nIt was followed by more stone images, by great slabs of carved stone,\nbricks, helmets, tools, weapons, fetters, wine-jars, bowls, bottles,\nvases, jugs, saucers, seals, and the round long things, something like\nrolling pins with marks on them like the print of little bird-feet,\nnecklaces, collars, rings, armlets, earrings--heaps and heaps and\nheaps of things, far more than anyone had time to count, or even to see\ndistinctly.\n\nAll the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps except\nthe nice one. He stood with his hands in his pockets just as though\nhe was quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of small\nBabylonish objects float out into the Museum yard.\n\nBut he sent a man to close the big iron gates.\n\nA journalist, who was just leaving the museum, spoke to Robert as he\npassed.\n\n‘Theosophy, I suppose?’ he said. ‘Is she Mrs Besant?’\n\n‘YES,’ said Robert recklessly.\n\nThe journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut.\n\nHe rushed off to Fleet Street, and his paper got out a new edition\nwithin half an hour.\n\n   MRS BESANT AND THEOSOPHY\n\n   IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\n\nPeople saw it in fat, black letters on the boards carried by the sellers\nof newspapers. Some few people who had nothing better to do went down\nto the Museum on the tops of omnibuses. But by the time they got there\nthere was nothing to be seen. For the Babylonian Queen had suddenly seen\nthe closed gates, had felt the threat of them, and had said--\n\n‘I wish we were in your house.’\n\nAnd, of course, instantly they were.\n\nThe Psammead was furious.\n\n‘Look here,’ it said, ‘they’ll come after you, and they’ll find ME.\nThere’ll be a National Cage built for me at Westminster, and I shall\nhave to work at politics. Why wouldn’t you leave the things in their\nplaces?’\n\n‘What a temper you have, haven’t you?’ said the Queen serenely. ‘I wish\nall the things were back in their places. Will THAT do for you?’\n\nThe Psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily.\n\n‘I can’t refuse to give your wishes,’ it said, ‘but I can Bite. And I\nwill if this goes on. Now then.’\n\n‘Ah, don’t,’ whispered Anthea close to its bristling ear; ‘it’s dreadful\nfor us too. Don’t YOU desert us. Perhaps she’ll wish herself at home\nagain soon.’\n\n‘Not she,’ said the Psammead a little less crossly.\n\n‘Take me to see your City,’ said the Queen.\n\nThe children looked at each other.\n\n‘If we had some money we could take her about in a cab. People wouldn’t\nnotice her so much then. But we haven’t.’\n\n‘Sell this,’ said the Queen, taking a ring from her finger.\n\n‘They’d only think we’d stolen it,’ said Cyril bitterly, ‘and put us in\nprison.’\n\n‘All roads lead to prison with you, it seems,’ said the Queen.\n\n‘The learned gentleman!’ said Anthea, and ran up to him with the ring in\nher hand.\n\n‘Look here,’ she said, ‘will you buy this for a pound?’\n\n‘Oh!’ he said in tones of joy and amazement, and took the ring into his\nhand. ‘It’s my very own,’ said Anthea; ‘it was given to me to sell.’\n\n‘I’ll lend you a pound,’ said the learned gentleman, ‘with pleasure; and\nI’ll take care of the ring for you. Who did you say gave it to you?’\n\n‘We call her,’ said Anthea carefully, ‘the Queen of Babylon.’\n\n‘Is it a game?’ he asked hopefully.\n\n‘It’ll be a pretty game if I don’t get the money to pay for cabs for\nher,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘I sometimes think,’ he said slowly, ‘that I am becoming insane, or\nthat--’\n\n‘Or that I am; but I’m not, and you’re not, and she’s not.’\n\n‘Does she SAY that she’s the Queen of Babylon?’ he uneasily asked.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea recklessly.\n\n‘This thought-transference is more far-reaching than I imagined,’ he\nsaid. ‘I suppose I have unconsciously influenced HER, too. I never\nthought my Babylonish studies would bear fruit like this. Horrible!\nThere are more things in heaven and earth--’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea, ‘heaps more. And the pound is the thing _I_ want\nmore than anything on earth.’\n\nHe ran his fingers through his thin hair.\n\n‘This thought-transference!’ he said. ‘It’s undoubtedly a Babylonian\nring--or it seems so to me. But perhaps I have hypnotized myself. I will\nsee a doctor the moment I have corrected the last proofs of my book.’\n\n‘Yes, do!’ said Anthea, ‘and thank you so very much.’\n\nShe took the sovereign and ran down to the others.\n\nAnd now from the window of a four-wheeled cab the Queen of Babylon\nbeheld the wonders of London. Buckingham Palace she thought\nuninteresting; Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament little\nbetter. But she liked the Tower, and the River, and the ships filled her\nwith wonder and delight.\n\n‘But how badly you keep your slaves. How wretched and poor and neglected\nthey seem,’ she said, as the cab rattled along the Mile End Road.\n\n‘They aren’t slaves; they’re working-people,’ said Jane.\n\n‘Of course they’re working. That’s what slaves are. Don’t you tell me.\nDo you suppose I don’t know a slave’s face when I see it?\n\nWhy don’t their masters see that they’re better fed and better clothed?\nTell me in three words.’\n\nNo one answered. The wage-system of modern England is a little difficult\nto explain in three words even if you understand it--which the children\ndidn’t.\n\n‘You’ll have a revolt of your slaves if you’re not careful,’ said the\nQueen.\n\n‘Oh, no,’ said Cyril; ‘you see they have votes--that makes them safe not\nto revolt. It makes all the difference. Father told me so.’\n\n‘What is this vote?’ asked the Queen. ‘Is it a charm? What do they do\nwith it?’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ said the harassed Cyril; ‘it’s just a vote, that’s all!\nThey don’t do anything particular with it.’\n\n‘I see,’ said the Queen; ‘a sort of plaything. Well, I wish that all\nthese slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill of their\nfavourite meat and drink.’\n\nInstantly all the people in the Mile End Road, and in all the other\nstreets where poor people live, found their hands full of things to eat\nand drink. From the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind\nof food, and bottles and cans as well. Roast meat, fowls, red lobsters,\ngreat yellowy crabs, fried fish, boiled pork, beef-steak puddings, baked\nonions, mutton pies; most of the young people had oranges and sweets\nand cake. It made an enormous change in the look of the Mile End\nRoad--brightened it up, so to speak, and brightened up, more than you\ncan possibly imagine, the faces of the people.\n\n‘Makes a difference, doesn’t it?’ said the Queen.\n\n‘That’s the best wish you’ve had yet,’ said Jane with cordial approval.\n\njust by the Bank the cabman stopped.\n\n‘I ain’t agoin’ to drive you no further,’ he said. ‘Out you gets.’\n\nThey got out rather unwillingly.\n\n‘I wants my tea,’ he said; and they saw that on the box of the cab was a\nmound of cabbage, with pork chops and apple sauce, a duck, and a spotted\ncurrant pudding. Also a large can.\n\n‘You pay me my fare,’ he said threateningly, and looked down at the\nmound, muttering again about his tea.\n\n‘We’ll take another cab,’ said Cyril with dignity. ‘Give me change for a\nsovereign, if you please.’\n\nBut the cabman, as it turned out, was not at all a nice character. He\ntook the sovereign, whipped up his horse, and disappeared in the stream\nof cabs and omnibuses and wagons, without giving them any change at all.\n\nAlready a little crowd was collecting round the party.\n\n‘Come on,’ said Robert, leading the wrong way.\n\nThe crowd round them thickened. They were in a narrow street where many\ngentlemen in black coats and without hats were standing about on the\npavement talking very loudly.\n\n‘How ugly their clothes are,’ said the Queen of Babylon. ‘They’d be\nrather fine men, some of them, if they were dressed decently, especially\nthe ones with the beautiful long, curved noses. I wish they were dressed\nlike the Babylonians of my court.’\n\nAnd of course, it was so.\n\nThe moment the almost fainting Psammead had blown itself out every man\nin Throgmorton Street appeared abruptly in Babylonian full dress.\n\nAll were carefully powdered, their hair and beards were scented and\ncurled, their garments richly embroidered. They wore rings and armlets,\nflat gold collars and swords, and impossible-looking head-dresses.\n\nA stupefied silence fell on them.\n\n‘I say,’ a youth who had always been fair-haired broke that silence,\n‘it’s only fancy of course--something wrong with my eyes--but you chaps\ndo look so rum.’\n\n‘Rum,’ said his friend. ‘Look at YOU. You in a sash! My hat! And your\nhair’s gone black and you’ve got a beard. It’s my belief we’ve been\npoisoned. You do look a jackape.’\n\n‘Old Levinstein don’t look so bad. But how was it DONE--that’s what I\nwant to know. How was it done? Is it conjuring, or what?’\n\n‘I think it is chust a ver’ bad tream,’ said old Levinstein to his\nclerk; ‘all along Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people have their\nhants full of food--GOOT food. Oh yes, without doubt a very bad tream!’\n\n‘Then I’m dreaming too, Sir,’ said the clerk, looking down at his legs\nwith an expression of loathing. ‘I see my feet in beastly sandals as\nplain as plain.’\n\n‘All that goot food wasted,’ said old Mr Levinstein. A bad tream--a bad\ntream.’\n\nThe Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a noisy\nlot. But the noise they made now to express their disgust at the\ncostumes of ancient Babylon was far louder than their ordinary row. One\nhad to shout before one could hear oneself speak.\n\n‘I only wish,’ said the clerk who thought it was conjuring--he was quite\nclose to the children and they trembled, because they knew that whatever\nhe wished would come true. ‘I only wish we knew who’d done it.’\n\nAnd, of course, instantly they did know, and they pressed round the\nQueen.\n\n‘Scandalous! Shameful! Ought to be put down by law. Give her in charge.\nFetch the police,’ two or three voices shouted at once.\n\nThe Queen recoiled.\n\n‘What is it?’ she asked. ‘They sound like caged lions--lions by the\nthousand. What is it that they say?’\n\n‘They say “Police!”,’ said Cyril briefly. ‘I knew they would sooner or\nlater. And I don’t blame them, mind you.’\n\n‘I wish my guards were here!’ cried the Queen. The exhausted Psammead\nwas panting and trembling, but the Queen’s guards in red and green\ngarments, and brass and iron gear, choked Throgmorton Street, and bared\nweapons flashed round the Queen.\n\n‘I’m mad,’ said a Mr Rosenbaum; ‘dat’s what it is--mad!’\n\n‘It’s a judgement on you, Rosy,’ said his partner. ‘I always said you\nwere too hard in that matter of Flowerdew. It’s a judgement, and I’m in\nit too.’\n\nThe members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from the\ngleaming blades, the mailed figures, the hard, cruel Eastern faces.\n\nBut Throgmorton Street is narrow, and the crowd was too thick for them\nto get away as quickly as they wished.\n\n‘Kill them,’ cried the Queen. ‘Kill the dogs!’\n\nThe guards obeyed.\n\n‘It IS all a dream,’ cried Mr Levinstein, cowering in a doorway behind\nhis clerk.\n\n‘It isn’t,’ said the clerk. ‘It isn’t. Oh, my good gracious! those\nforeign brutes are killing everybody. Henry Hirsh is down now, and\nPrentice is cut in two--oh, Lord! and Huth, and there goes Lionel Cohen\nwith his head off, and Guy Nickalls has lost his head now. A dream? I\nwish to goodness it was all a dream.’\n\nAnd, of course, instantly it was! The entire Stock Exchange rubbed its\neyes and went back to close, to over, and either side of seven-eights,\nand Trunks, and Kaffirs, and Steel Common, and Contangoes, and\nBackwardations, Double Options, and all the interesting subjects\nconcerning which they talk in the Street without ceasing.\n\nNo one said a word about it to anyone else. I think I have explained\nbefore that business men do not like it to be known that they have\nbeen dreaming in business hours. Especially mad dreams including such\ndreadful things as hungry people getting dinners, and the destruction of\nthe Stock Exchange.\n\n\nThe children were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street, pale and\ntrembling. The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag, and lay flat\non the table, its leg stretched out, looking more like a dead hare than\nanything else.\n\n‘Thank Goodness that’s over,’ said Anthea, drawing a deep breath.\n\n‘She won’t come back, will she?’ asked Jane tremulously.\n\n‘No,’ said Cyril. ‘She’s thousands of years ago. But we spent a whole\nprecious pound on her. It’ll take all our pocket-money for ages to pay\nthat back.’\n\n‘Not if it was ALL a dream,’ said Robert.\n\n‘The wish said ALL a dream, you know, Panther; you cut up and ask if he\nlent you anything.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ said Anthea politely, following the sound of her\nknock into the presence of the learned gentleman, ‘I’m so sorry to\ntrouble you, but DID you lend me a pound today?’\n\n‘No,’ said he, looking kindly at her through his spectacles. ‘But it’s\nextraordinary that you should ask me, for I dozed for a few moments this\nafternoon, a thing I very rarely do, and I dreamed quite distinctly that\nyou brought me a ring that you said belonged to the Queen of Babylon,\nand that I lent you a sovereign and that you left one of the Queen’s\nrings here. The ring was a magnificent specimen.’ He sighed. ‘I wish it\nhadn’t been a dream,’ he said smiling. He was really learning to smile\nquite nicely.\n\nAnthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there to\ngrant his wish.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. ATLANTIS\n\nYou will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen in London\nwas the only one that had occupied any time at all. But the children’s\ntime was very fully taken up by talking over all the wonderful things\nseen and done in the Past, where, by the power of the Amulet, they\nseemed to spend hours and hours, only to find when they got back to\nLondon that the whole thing had been briefer than a lightning flash.\n\nThey talked of the Past at their meals, in their walks, in the\ndining-room, in the first-floor drawing-room, but most of all on the\nstairs. It was an old house; it had once been a fashionable one, and was\na fine one still. The banister rails of the stairs were excellent for\nsliding down, and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves that\nhad once held graceful statues, and now quite often held the graceful\nforms of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.\n\nOne day Cyril and Robert in tight white underclothing had spent a\npleasant hour in reproducing the attitudes of statues seen either in the\nBritish Museum, or in Father’s big photograph book. But the show ended\nabruptly because Robert wanted to be the Venus of Milo, and for this\npurpose pulled at the sheet which served for drapery at the very moment\nwhen Cyril, looking really quite like the Discobolos--with a gold and\nwhite saucer for the disc--was standing on one foot, and under that one\nfoot was the sheet.\n\nOf course the Discobolos and his disc and the would-be Venus came down\ntogether, and everyone was a good deal hurt, especially the saucer,\nwhich would never be the same again, however neatly one might join its\nuneven bits with Seccotine or the white of an egg.\n\n‘I hope you’re satisfied,’ said Cyril, holding his head where a large\nlump was rising.\n\n‘Quite, thanks,’ said Robert bitterly. His thumb had caught in the\nbanisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point.\n\n‘I AM so sorry, poor, dear Squirrel,’ said Anthea; ‘and you were looking\nso lovely. I’ll get a wet rag. Bobs, go and hold your hand under the\nhot-water tap. It’s what ballet girls do with their legs when they hurt\nthem. I saw it in a book.’\n\n‘What book?’ said Robert disagreeably. But he went.\n\nWhen he came back Cyril’s head had been bandaged by his sisters, and he\nhad been brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to\nadmit that he supposed Robert hadn’t done it on purpose.\n\nRobert replying with equal suavity, Anthea hastened to lead the talk\naway from the accident.\n\n‘I suppose you don’t feel like going anywhere through the Amulet,’ she\nsaid.\n\n‘Egypt!’ said Jane promptly. ‘I want to see the pussy cats.’\n\n‘Not me--too hot,’ said Cyril. ‘It’s about as much as I can stand\nhere--let alone Egypt.’ It was indeed, hot, even on the second landing,\nwhich was the coolest place in the house. ‘Let’s go to the North Pole.’\n\n‘I don’t suppose the Amulet was ever there--and we might get our fingers\nfrost-bitten so that we could never hold it up to get home again. No\nthanks,’ said Robert.\n\n‘I say,’ said Jane, ‘let’s get the Psammead and ask its advice. It will\nlike us asking, even if we don’t take it.’\n\nThe Psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag, but\nbefore it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentleman’s\nroom opened and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him\nwas heard on the stairs. He seemed to be speaking with the door handle\nin his hand.\n\n‘You see a doctor, old boy,’ he said; ‘all that about\nthought-transference is just simply twaddle. You’ve been over-working.\nTake a holiday. Go to Dieppe.’\n\n‘I’d rather go to Babylon,’ said the learned gentleman.\n\n‘I wish you’d go to Atlantis some time, while we’re about it, so as to\ngive me some tips for my Nineteenth Century article when you come home.’\n\n‘I wish I could,’ said the voice of the learned gentleman. ‘Goodbye.\nTake care of yourself.’\n\nThe door was banged, and the visitor came smiling down the stairs--a\nstout, prosperous, big man. The children had to get up to let him pass.\n\n‘Hullo, Kiddies,’ he said, glancing at the bandages on the head of Cyril\nand the hand of Robert, ‘been in the wars?’\n\n‘It’s all right,’ said Cyril. ‘I say, what was that Atlantic place you\nwanted him to go to? We couldn’t help hearing you talk.’\n\n‘You talk so VERY loud, you see,’ said Jane soothingly.\n\n‘Atlantis,’ said the visitor, ‘the lost Atlantis, garden of the\nHesperides. Great continent--disappeared in the sea. You can read about\nit in Plato.’\n\n‘Thank you,’ said Cyril doubtfully.\n\n‘Were there any Amulets there?’ asked Anthea, made anxious by a sudden\nthought.\n\n‘Hundreds, I should think. So HE’S been talking to you?’\n\n‘Yes, often. He’s very kind to us. We like him awfully.’\n\n‘Well, what he wants is a holiday; you persuade him to take one. What\nhe wants is a change of scene. You see, his head is crusted so thickly\ninside with knowledge about Egypt and Assyria and things that you can’t\nhammer anything into it unless you keep hard at it all day long for days\nand days. And I haven’t time. But you live in the house. You can hammer\nalmost incessantly. Just try your hands, will you? Right. So long!’\n\nHe went down the stairs three at a time, and Jane remarked that he was a\nnice man, and she thought he had little girls of his own.\n\n‘I should like to have them to play with,’ she added pensively.\n\nThe three elder ones exchanged glances. Cyril nodded.\n\n‘All right. LET’S go to Atlantis,’ he said.\n\n‘Let’s go to Atlantis and take the learned gentleman with us,’ said\nAnthea; ‘he’ll think it’s a dream, afterwards, but it’ll certainly be a\nchange of scene.’\n\n‘Why not take him to nice Egypt?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘Too hot,’ said Cyril shortly.\n\n‘Or Babylon, where he wants to go?’\n\n‘I’ve had enough of Babylon,’ said Robert, ‘at least for the present.\nAnd so have the others. I don’t know why,’ he added, forestalling the\nquestion on Jane’s lips, ‘but somehow we have. Squirrel, let’s take\noff these beastly bandages and get into flannels. We can’t go in our\nunders.’\n\n‘He WISHED to go to Atlantis, so he’s got to go some time; and he might\nas well go with us,’ said Anthea.\n\nThis was how it was that the learned gentleman, permitting himself a few\nmoments of relaxation in his chair, after the fatigue of listening to\nopinions (about Atlantis and many other things) with which he did not\nat all agree, opened his eyes to find his four young friends standing in\nfront of him in a row.\n\n‘Will you come,’ said Anthea, ‘to Atlantis with us?’\n\n‘To know that you are dreaming shows that the dream is nearly at an\nend,’ he told himself; ‘or perhaps it’s only a game, like “How many\nmiles to Babylon?”.’ So he said aloud: ‘Thank you very much, but I have\nonly a quarter of an hour to spare.’\n\n‘It doesn’t take any time,’ said Cyril; ‘time is only a mode of thought,\nyou know, and you’ve got to go some time, so why not with us?’\n\n‘Very well,’ said the learned gentleman, now quite certain that he was\ndreaming.\n\nAnthea held out her soft, pink hand. He took it. She pulled him gently\nto his feet. Jane held up the Amulet.\n\n‘To just outside Atlantis,’ said Cyril, and Jane said the Name of Power.\n\n‘You owl!’ said Robert, ‘it’s an island. Outside an island’s all water.’\n\n‘I won’t go. I WON’T,’ said the Psammead, kicking and struggling in its\nbag.\n\nBut already the Amulet had grown to a great arch. Cyril pushed the\nlearned gentleman, as undoubtedly the first-born, through the arch--not\ninto water, but on to a wooden floor, out of doors. The others followed.\nThe Amulet grew smaller again, and there they all were, standing on the\ndeck of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast with chains to\nrings on a white quay-side. The rings and the chains were of a metal\nthat shone red-yellow like gold.\n\nEveryone on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of\nnewcomers from Fitzroy Street. Those who seemed to be officers were\nshouting orders to the men.\n\nThey stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond\nit. What they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever\nseen--or ever dreamed of.\n\nThe blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight; little white-capped waves broke\nsoftly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a\ngreat city from the wilderness of winter winds and seas. The quay was of\nmarble, white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold. The city\nwas of marble, red and white. The greater buildings that seemed to be\ntemples and palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver,\nbut most of the roofs were of copper that glowed golden-red on the\nhouses on the hills among which the city stood, and shaded into\nmarvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been\ntouched by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting\nworks of the lower town.\n\nBroad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to a\nsort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles, and beyond rose the\ntown built on a hill.\n\nThe learned gentleman drew a long breath. ‘Wonderful!’ he said,\n‘wonderful!’\n\n‘I say, Mr--what’s your name,’ said Robert. ‘He means,’ said Anthea,\nwith gentle politeness, ‘that we never can remember your name. I know\nit’s Mr De Something.’\n\n‘When I was your age I was called Jimmy,’ he said timidly. ‘Would you\nmind? I should feel more at home in a dream like this if I--Anything\nthat made me seem more like one of you.’\n\n‘Thank you--Jimmy,’ said Anthea with an effort. It seemed such a cheek\nto be saying Jimmy to a grown-up man. ‘Jimmy, DEAR,’ she added, with no\neffort at all. Jimmy smiled and looked pleased.\n\nBut now the ship was made fast, and the Captain had time to notice other\nthings. He came towards them, and he was dressed in the best of all\npossible dresses for the seafaring life.\n\n‘What are you doing here?’ he asked rather fiercely. ‘Do you come to\nbless or to curse?’\n\n‘To bless, of course,’ said Cyril. ‘I’m sorry if it annoys you, but\nwe’re here by magic. We come from the land of the sun-rising,’ he went\non explanatorily.\n\n‘I see,’ said the Captain; no one had expected that he would. ‘I didn’t\nnotice at first, but of course I hope you’re a good omen. It’s needed.\nAnd this,’ he pointed to the learned gentleman, ‘your slave, I presume?’\n\n‘Not at all,’ said Anthea; ‘he’s a very great man. A sage, don’t they\ncall it? And we want to see all your beautiful city, and your temples\nand things, and then we shall go back, and he will tell his friend, and\nhis friend will write a book about it.’\n\n‘What,’ asked the Captain, fingering a rope, ‘is a book?’\n\n‘A record--something written, or,’ she added hastily, remembering the\nBabylonian writing, ‘or engraved.’\n\nSome sudden impulse of confidence made Jane pluck the Amulet from the\nneck of her frock.\n\n‘Like this,’ she said.\n\nThe Captain looked at it curiously, but, the other three were relieved\nto notice, without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere name\nof it had roused in Egypt and Babylon.\n\n‘The stone is of our country,’ he said; ‘and that which is engraved on\nit, it is like our writing, but I cannot read it. What is the name of\nyour sage?’\n\n‘Ji-jimmy,’ said Anthea hesitatingly.\n\nThe Captain repeated, ‘Ji-jimmy. Will you land?’ he added. ‘And shall I\nlead you to the Kings?’\n\n‘Look here,’ said Robert, ‘does your King hate strangers?’\n\n‘Our Kings are ten,’ said the Captain, ‘and the Royal line, unbroken\nfrom Poseidon, the father of us all, has the noble tradition to do\nhonour to strangers if they come in peace.’\n\n‘Then lead on, please,’ said Robert, ‘though I SHOULD like to see all\nover your beautiful ship, and sail about in her.’\n\n‘That shall be later,’ said the Captain; ‘just now we’re afraid of a\nstorm--do you notice that odd rumbling?’\n\n‘That’s nothing, master,’ said an old sailor who stood near; ‘it’s the\npilchards coming in, that’s all.’\n\n‘Too loud,’ said the Captain.\n\nThere was a rather anxious pause; then the Captain stepped on to the\nquay, and the others followed him.\n\n‘Do talk to him--Jimmy,’ said Anthea as they went; ‘you can find out all\nsorts of things for your friend’s book.’\n\n‘Please excuse me,’ he said earnestly. ‘If I talk I shall wake up; and\nbesides, I can’t understand what he says.’\n\nNo one else could think of anything to say, so that it was in complete\nsilence that they followed the Captain up the marble steps and through\nthe streets of the town. There were streets and shops and houses and\nmarkets.\n\n‘It’s just like Babylon,’ whispered Jane, ‘only everything’s perfectly\ndifferent.’\n\n‘It’s a great comfort the ten Kings have been properly brought up--to be\nkind to strangers,’ Anthea whispered to Cyril.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said, ‘no deepest dungeons here.’\n\nThere were no horses or chariots in the street, but there were handcarts\nand low trolleys running on thick log-wheels, and porters carrying\npackets on their heads, and a good many of the people were riding on\nwhat looked like elephants, only the great beasts were hairy, and they\nhad not that mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the faces of\nthe elephants at the Zoo.\n\n‘Mammoths!’ murmured the learned gentleman, and stumbled over a loose\nstone.\n\nThe people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along,\nbut the Captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew uncomfortably\nthick by saying--\n\n‘Children of the Sun God and their High Priest--come to bless the City.’\n\nAnd then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like\na suppressed cheer.\n\nMany of the buildings were covered with gold, but the gold on the bigger\nbuildings was of a different colour, and they had sorts of steeples of\nburnished silver rising above them.\n\n‘Are all these houses real gold?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘The temples are covered with gold, of course,’ answered the Captain,\n‘but the houses are only oricalchum. It’s not quite so expensive.’\n\nThe learned gentleman, now very pale, stumbled along in a dazed way,\nrepeating:\n\n‘Oricalchum--oricalchum.’\n\n‘Don’t be frightened,’ said Anthea; ‘we can get home in a minute, just\nby holding up the charm. Would you rather go back now? We could easily\ncome some other day without you.’\n\n‘Oh, no, no,’ he pleaded fervently; ‘let the dream go on. Please, please\ndo.’\n\n‘The High Ji-jimmy is perhaps weary with his magic journey,’ said the\nCaptain, noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman; ‘and\nwe are yet very far from the Great Temple, where today the Kings make\nsacrifice.’\n\nHe stopped at the gate of a great enclosure. It seemed to be a sort of\npark, for trees showed high above its brazen wall.\n\nThe party waited, and almost at once the Captain came back with one of\nthe hairy elephants and begged them to mount.\n\nThis they did.\n\nIt was a glorious ride. The elephant at the Zoo--to ride on him is also\nglorious, but he goes such a very little way, and then he goes back\nagain, which is always dull. But this great hairy beast went on and on\nand on along streets and through squares and gardens. It was a glorious\ncity; almost everything was built of marble, red, or white, or black.\nEvery now and then the party crossed a bridge.\n\nIt was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the\ntown that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles,\nalternately land and water, and over each of the water circles were the\nbridges by which they had come.\n\nAnd now they were in a great square. A vast building filled up one side\nof it; it was overlaid with gold, and had a dome of silver. The rest of\nthe buildings round the square were of oricalchum. And it looked more\nsplendid than you can possibly imagine, standing up bold and shining in\nthe sunlight.\n\n‘You would like a bath,’ said the Captain, as the hairy elephant went\nclumsily down on his knees. ‘It’s customary, you know, before entering\nthe Presence. We have baths for men, women, horses, and cattle. The High\nClass Baths are here. Our Father Poseidon gave us a spring of hot water\nand one of cold.’\n\nThe children had never before bathed in baths of gold.\n\n‘It feels very splendid,’ said Cyril, splashing.\n\n‘At least, of course, it’s not gold; it’s or--what’s its name,’ said\nRobert. ‘Hand over that towel.’\n\nThe bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the\nfloor; one went down to them by steps.\n\n‘Jimmy,’ said Anthea timidly, when, very clean and boiled-looking, they\nall met in the flowery courtyard of the Public, ‘don’t you think all\nthis seems much more like NOW than Babylon or Egypt--? Oh, I forgot,\nyou’ve never been there.’\n\n‘I know a little of those nations, however,’ said he, ‘and I quite agree\nwith you. A most discerning remark--my dear,’ he added awkwardly; ‘this\ncity certainly seems to indicate a far higher level of civilization than\nthe Egyptian or Babylonish, and--’\n\n‘Follow me,’ said the Captain. ‘Now, boys, get out of the way.’ He\npushed through a little crowd of boys who were playing with dried\nchestnuts fastened to a string.\n\n‘Ginger!’ remarked Robert, ‘they’re playing conkers, just like the kids\nin Kentish Town Road!’\n\nThey could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they\nwere. The outermost wall was of brass, the Captain told them; the next,\nwhich looked like silver, was covered with tin; and the innermost one\nwas of oricalchum.\n\nAnd right in the middle was a wall of gold, with golden towers and\ngates.\n\n‘Behold the Temples of Poseidon,’ said the Captain. ‘It is not lawful\nfor me to enter. I will await your return here.’\n\nHe told them what they ought to say, and the five people from Fitzroy\nStreet took hands and went forward. The golden gates slowly opened.\n\n‘We are the children of the Sun,’ said Cyril, as he had been told, ‘and\nour High Priest, at least that’s what the Captain calls him. We have a\ndifferent name for him at home.’ ‘What is his name?’ asked a white-robed\nman who stood in the doorway with his arms extended.\n\n‘Ji-jimmy,’ replied Cyril, and he hesitated as Anthea had done.\nIt really did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a\ngentleman. ‘And we have come to speak with your Kings in the Temple of\nPoseidon--does that word sound right?’ he whispered anxiously.\n\n‘Quite,’ said the learned gentleman. ‘It’s very odd I can understand\nwhat you say to them, but not what they say to you.’\n\n‘The Queen of Babylon found that too,’ said Cyril; ‘it’s part of the\nmagic.’\n\n‘Oh, what a dream!’ said the learned gentleman.\n\nThe white-robed priest had been joined by others, and all were bowing\nlow.\n\n‘Enter,’ he said, ‘enter, Children of the Sun, with your High Ji-jimmy.’\n\nIn an inner courtyard stood the Temple--all of silver, with gold\npinnacles and doors, and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men\nand women. Also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal.\n\nThey went through the doors, and the priest led them up a stair into a\ngallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place.\n\n‘The ten Kings are even now choosing the bull. It is not lawful for me\nto behold,’ said the priest, and fell face downward on the floor outside\nthe gallery. The children looked down.\n\nThe roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals, and the\nwalls were lined with the favourite oricalchum.\n\nAt the far end of the Temple was a statue group, the like of which no\none living has ever seen.\n\nIt was of gold, and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof.\nThat figure was Poseidon, the Father of the City. He stood in a great\nchariot drawn by six enormous horses, and round about it were a hundred\nmermaids riding on dolphins.\n\nTen men, splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes, were\ntrying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that\nabout the floor of the Temple. The children held their breath, for the\nbulls looked dangerous, and the great horned heads were swinging more\nand more wildly.\n\nAnthea did not like looking at the bulls. She looked about the gallery,\nand noticed that another staircase led up from it to a still higher\nstorey; also that a door led out into the open air, where there seemed\nto be a balcony.\n\nSo that when a shout went up and Robert whispered, ‘Got him,’ and she\nlooked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the Temple by\nwhips, and the ten Kings following, one of them spurring with his\nstick a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso, she\nanswered the boy’s agitated, ‘Now we shan’t see anything more,’ with--\n\n‘Yes we can, there’s an outside balcony.’\n\nSo they crowded out.\n\nBut very soon the girls crept back.\n\n‘I don’t like sacrifices,’ Jane said. So she and Anthea went and talked\nto the priest, who was no longer lying on his face, but sitting on the\ntop step mopping his forehead with his robe, for it was a hot day.\n\n‘It’s a special sacrifice,’ he said; ‘usually it’s only done on the\njustice days every five years and six years alternately. And then they\ndrink the cup of wine with some of the bull’s blood in it, and swear\nto judge truly. And they wear the sacred blue robe, and put out all the\nTemple fires. But this today is because the City’s so upset by the odd\nnoises from the sea, and the god inside the big mountain speaking with\nhis thunder-voice. But all that’s happened so often before. If anything\ncould make ME uneasy it wouldn’t be THAT.’\n\n‘What would it be?’ asked Jane kindly.\n\n‘It would be the Lemmings.’\n\n‘Who are they--enemies?’\n\n‘They’re a sort of rat; and every year they come swimming over from the\ncountry that no man knows, and stay here awhile, and then swim away.\nThis year they haven’t come. You know rats won’t stay on a ship that’s\ngoing to be wrecked. If anything horrible were going to happen to us,\nit’s my belief those Lemmings would know; and that may be why they’ve\nfought shy of us.’\n\n‘What do you call this country?’ asked the Psammead, suddenly putting\nits head out of its bag.\n\n‘Atlantis,’ said the priest.\n\n‘Then I advise you to get on to the highest ground you can find. I\nremember hearing something about a flood here. Look here, you’--it\nturned to Anthea; ‘let’s get home. The prospect’s too wet for my\nwhiskers.’ The girls obediently went to find their brothers, who were\nleaning on the balcony railings.\n\n‘Where’s the learned gentleman?’ asked Anthea.\n\n‘There he is--below,’ said the priest, who had come with them. ‘Your\nHigh Ji-jimmy is with the Kings.’\n\nThe ten Kings were no longer alone. The learned gentleman--no one had\nnoticed how he got there--stood with them on the steps of an altar, on\nwhich lay the dead body of the black bull. All the rest of the courtyard\nwas thick with people, seemingly of all classes, and all were shouting,\n‘The sea--the sea!’\n\n‘Be calm,’ said the most kingly of the Kings, he who had lassoed the\nbull. ‘Our town is strong against the thunders of the sea and of the\nsky!’\n\n‘I want to go home,’ whined the Psammead.\n\n‘We can’t go without HIM,’ said Anthea firmly.\n\n‘Jimmy,’ she called, ‘Jimmy!’ and waved to him. He heard her, and began\nto come towards her through the crowd. They could see from the balcony\nthe sea-captain edging his way out from among the people. And his face\nwas dead white, like paper.\n\n‘To the hills!’ he cried in a loud and terrible voice. And above his\nvoice came another voice, louder, more terrible--the voice of the sea.\n\nThe girls looked seaward.\n\nAcross the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled\ntowards the town. It was a wave, but a wave a hundred feet in height, a\nwave that looked like a mountain--a wave rising higher and higher till\nsuddenly it seemed to break in two--one half of it rushed out to sea\nagain; the other--\n\n‘Oh!’ cried Anthea, ‘the town--the poor people!’\n\n‘It’s all thousands of years ago, really,’ said Robert but his voice\ntrembled. They hid their eyes for a moment. They could not bear to look\ndown, for the wave had broken on the face of the town, sweeping over\nthe quays and docks, overwhelming the great storehouses and factories,\ntearing gigantic stones from forts and bridges, and using them as\nbattering rams against the temples. Great ships were swept over the\nroofs of the houses and dashed down halfway up the hill among ruined\ngardens and broken buildings. The water ground brown fishing-boats to\npowder on the golden roofs of Palaces.\n\nThen the wave swept back towards the sea.\n\n‘I want to go home,’ cried the Psammead fiercely.\n\n‘Oh, yes, yes!’ said Jane, and the boys were ready--but the learned\ngentleman had not come.\n\nThen suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery, crying--\n\n‘I MUST see the end of the dream.’ He rushed up the higher flight.\n\nThe others followed him. They found themselves in a sort of\nturret--roofed, but open to the air at the sides.\n\nThe learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet, and as they\nrejoined him the vast wave rushed back on the town. This time it rose\nhigher--destroyed more.\n\n‘Come home,’ cried the Psammead; ‘THAT’S the LAST, I know it is! That’s\nthe last--over there.’ It pointed with a claw that trembled.\n\n‘Oh, come!’ cried Jane, holding up the Amulet.\n\n‘I WILL SEE the end of the dream,’ cried the learned gentleman.\n\n‘You’ll never see anything else if you do,’ said Cyril. ‘Oh, JIMMY!’\nappealed Anthea. ‘I’ll NEVER bring you out again!’\n\n‘You’ll never have the chance if you don’t go soon,’ said the Psammead.\n\n‘I WILL see the end of the dream,’ said the learned gentleman\nobstinately.\n\nThe hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to the\nmountains. And even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great white\npeak, and then a faint flash of flame. Then the volcano began to throw\nup its mysterious fiery inside parts. The earth trembled; ashes and\nsulphur showered down; a rain of fine pumice-stone fell like snow on all\nthe dry land. The elephants from the forest rushed up towards the peaks;\ngreat lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain pools and\nrushed down towards the sea. The snows melted and rushed down, first in\navalanches, then in roaring torrents. Great rocks cast up by the volcano\nfell splashing in the sea miles away.\n\n‘Oh, this is horrible!’ cried Anthea. ‘Come home, come home!’\n\n‘The end of the dream,’ gasped the learned gentleman.\n\n‘Hold up the Amulet,’ cried the Psammead suddenly. The place where they\nstood was now crowded with men and women, and the children were strained\ntight against the parapet. The turret rocked and swayed; the wave had\nreached the golden wall.\n\nJane held up the Amulet.\n\n‘Now,’ cried the Psammead, ‘say the word!’\n\nAnd as Jane said it the Psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand of\nthe learned gentleman.\n\nAt the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all followed\nhim.\n\nHe turned to look back, and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste\nof waters, with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire\nraging from it.\n\n\nHe staggered back to his chair.\n\n‘What a ghastly dream!’ he gasped. ‘Oh, you’re here, my--er--dears. Can\nI do anything for you?’\n\n‘You’ve hurt your hand,’ said Anthea gently; ‘let me bind it up.’\n\nThe hand was indeed bleeding rather badly.\n\nThe Psammead had crept back to its bag. All the children were very\nwhite.\n\n\n‘Never again,’ said the Psammead later on, ‘will I go into the Past with\na grown-up person! I will say for you four, you do do as you’re told.’\n\n‘We didn’t even find the Amulet,’ said Anthea later still.\n\n‘Of course you didn’t; it wasn’t there. Only the stone it was made of\nwas there. It fell on to a ship miles away that managed to escape and\ngot to Egypt. _I_ could have told you that.’\n\n‘I wish you had,’ said Anthea, and her voice was still rather shaky.\n‘Why didn’t you?’\n\n‘You never asked me,’ said the Psammead very sulkily. ‘I’m not the sort\nof chap to go shoving my oar in where it’s not wanted.’\n\n‘Mr Ji-jimmy’s friend will have something worth having to put in his\narticle now,’ said Cyril very much later indeed.\n\n‘Not he,’ said Robert sleepily. ‘The learned Ji-jimmy will think it’s a\ndream, and it’s ten to one he never tells the other chap a word about it\nat all.’\n\nRobert was quite right on both points. The learned gentleman did. And he\nnever did.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL AND JULIUS CAESAR\n\nA great city swept away by the sea, a beautiful country devastated by\nan active volcano--these are not the sort of things you see every day of\nthe week. And when you do see them, no matter how many other wonders\nyou may have seen in your time, such sights are rather apt to take your\nbreath away. Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of Cyril,\nRobert, Anthea, and Jane.\n\nThey remained in a breathless state for some days. The learned gentleman\nseemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of what little\nbreath he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had. ‘You\nwould hardly believe,’ he said, ‘that anyone COULD have such a detailed\nvision.’\n\nBut Anthea could believe it, she said, quite easily.\n\nHe had ceased to talk about thought-transference. He had now seen too\nmany wonders to believe that.\n\nIn consequence of their breathless condition none of the children\nsuggested any new excursions through the Amulet. Robert voiced the mood\nof the others when he said that they were ‘fed up’ with Amulet for a\nbit. They undoubtedly were.\n\nAs for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out by\nthe terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in\nobedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the\nBabylonian queen.\n\nThe children let it sleep. The danger of taking it about among strange\npeople who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming\nmore and more plain.\n\nAnd there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from\nAmulets or Psammeads. You can, for instance visit the Tower of London,\nthe Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, the Zoological Gardens,\nthe various Parks, the Museums at South Kensington, Madame Tussaud’s\nExhibition of Waxworks, or the Botanical Gardens at Kew. You can go to\nKew by river steamer--and this is the way that the children would have\ngone if they had gone at all. Only they never did, because it was when\nthey were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what they\nshould take with them to eat and how much of it, and what the whole\nthing would cost, that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to\nhappen.\n\nThe children were sitting on a seat in St James’s Park. They had been\nwatching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of the\nseagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it. The pelican\nthinks, very properly, that it hasn’t the figure for games, so it spends\nmost of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it won’t\nplay.\n\nThe breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little. Cyril,\nwho always wanted to understand all about everything, was turning things\nover in his mind.\n\n‘I’m not; I’m only thinking,’ he answered when Robert asked him what he\nwas so grumpy about. ‘I’ll tell you when I’ve thought it all out.’\n\n‘If it’s about the Amulet I don’t want to hear it,’ said Jane.\n\n‘Nobody asked you to,’ retorted Cyril mildly, ‘and I haven’t finished my\ninside thinking about it yet. Let’s go to Kew in the meantime.’\n\n‘I’d rather go in a steamer,’ said Robert; and the girls laughed.\n\n‘That’s right,’ said Cyril, ‘BE funny. I would.’\n\n‘Well, he was, rather,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘I wouldn’t think, Squirrel, if it hurts you so,’ said Robert kindly.\n\n‘Oh, shut up,’ said Cyril, ‘or else talk about Kew.’\n\n‘I want to see the palms there,’ said Anthea hastily, ‘to see if they’re\nanything like the ones on the island where we united the Cook and the\nBurglar by the Reverend Half-Curate.’\n\nAll disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of recollections,\nand ‘Do you remember...?’ they said. ‘Have you forgotten...?’\n\n‘My hat!’ remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of reminiscence ebbed a\nlittle; ‘we have had some times.’\n\n‘We have that,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Don’t let’s have any more,’ said Jane anxiously.\n\n‘That’s what I was thinking about,’ Cyril replied; and just then they\nheard the Little Black Girl sniff. She was quite close to them.\n\nShe was not really a little black girl. She was shabby and not very\nclean, and she had been crying so much that you could hardly see,\nthrough the narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very blue her\neyes were. It was her dress that was black, and it was too big and too\nlong for her, and she wore a speckled black-ribboned sailor hat that\nwould have fitted a much bigger head than her little flaxen one. And she\nstood looking at the children and sniffing.\n\n‘Oh, dear!’ said Anthea, jumping up. ‘Whatever is the matter?’\n\nShe put her hand on the little girl’s arm. It was rudely shaken off.\n\n‘You leave me be,’ said the little girl. ‘I ain’t doing nothing to you.’\n\n‘But what is it?’ Anthea asked. ‘Has someone been hurting you?’\n\n‘What’s that to you?’ said the little girl fiercely. ‘YOU’RE all right.’\n\n‘Come away,’ said Robert, pulling at Anthea’s sleeve. ‘She’s a nasty,\nrude little kid.’\n\n‘Oh, no,’ said Anthea. ‘She’s only dreadfully unhappy. What is it?’ she\nasked again.\n\n‘Oh, YOU’RE all right,’ the child repeated; ‘YOU ain’t agoin’ to the\nUnion.’\n\n‘Can’t we take you home?’ said Anthea; and Jane added, ‘Where does your\nmother live?’\n\n‘She don’t live nowheres--she’s dead--so now!’ said the little girl\nfiercely, in tones of miserable triumph. Then she opened her swollen\neyes widely, stamped her foot in fury, and ran away. She ran no further\nthan to the next bench, flung herself down there and began to cry\nwithout even trying not to.\n\nAnthea, quite at once, went to the little girl and put her arms as tight\nas she could round the hunched-up black figure.\n\n‘Oh, don’t cry so, dear, don’t, don’t!’ she whispered under the brim of\nthe large sailor hat, now very crooked indeed. ‘Tell Anthea all about\nit; Anthea’ll help you. There, there, dear, don’t cry.’\n\nThe others stood at a distance. One or two passers-by stared curiously.\n\nThe child was now only crying part of the time; the rest of the time she\nseemed to be talking to Anthea.\n\nPresently Anthea beckoned Cyril.\n\n‘It’s horrible!’ she said in a furious whisper, ‘her father was a\ncarpenter and he was a steady man, and never touched a drop except on a\nSaturday, and he came up to London for work, and there wasn’t any, and\nthen he died; and her name is Imogen, and she’s nine come next\nNovember. And now her mother’s dead, and she’s to stay tonight with\nMrs Shrobsall--that’s a landlady that’s been kind--and tomorrow the\nRelieving Officer is coming for her, and she’s going into the Union;\nthat means the Workhouse. It’s too terrible. What can we do?’\n\n‘Let’s ask the learned gentleman,’ said Jane brightly.\n\nAnd as no one else could think of anything better the whole party walked\nback to Fitzroy Street as fast as it could, the little girl holding\ntight to Anthea’s hand and now not crying any more, only sniffing\ngently.\n\nThe learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile that had\ngrown much easier to him than it used to be. They were quite at home\nin his room now; it really seemed to welcome them. Even the mummy-case\nappeared to smile as if in its distant superior ancient Egyptian way it\nwere rather pleased to see them than not.\n\nAnthea sat on the stairs with Imogen, who was nine come next November,\nwhile the others went in and explained the difficulty.\n\nThe learned gentleman listened with grave attention.\n\n‘It really does seem rather rough luck,’ Cyril concluded, ‘because I’ve\noften heard about rich people who wanted children most awfully--though I\nknow _I_ never should--but they do. There must be somebody who’d be glad\nto have her.’\n\n‘Gipsies are awfully fond of children,’ Robert hopefully said. ‘They’re\nalways stealing them. Perhaps they’d have her.’\n\n‘She’s quite a nice little girl really,’ Jane added; ‘she was only\nrude at first because we looked jolly and happy, and she wasn’t. You\nunderstand that, don’t you?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said he, absently fingering a little blue image from Egypt. ‘I\nunderstand that very well. As you say, there must be some home where she\nwould be welcome.’ He scowled thoughtfully at the little blue image.\n\nAnthea outside thought the explanation was taking a very long time.\n\nShe was so busy trying to cheer and comfort the little black girl that\nshe never noticed the Psammead who, roused from sleep by her voice, had\nshaken itself free of sand, and was coming crookedly up the stairs. It\nwas close to her before she saw it. She picked it up and settled it in\nher lap.\n\n‘What is it?’ asked the black child. ‘Is it a cat or a organ-monkey, or\nwhat?’\n\nAnd then Anthea heard the learned gentleman say--\n\n‘Yes, I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to have her,’\nand instantly she felt the Psammead begin to blow itself out as it sat\non her lap.\n\nShe jumped up lifting the Psammead in her skirt, and holding Imogen by\nthe hand, rushed into the learned gentleman’s room.\n\n‘At least let’s keep together,’ she cried. ‘All hold hands--quick!’\n\nThe circle was like that formed for the Mulberry Bush or Ring-o’-Roses.\nAnd Anthea was only able to take part in it by holding in her teeth\nthe hem of her frock which, thus supported, formed a bag to hold the\nPsammead.\n\n‘Is it a game?’ asked the learned gentleman feebly. No one answered.\n\nThere was a moment of suspense; then came that curious upside-down,\ninside-out sensation which one almost always feels when transported\nfrom one place to another by magic. Also there was that dizzy dimness of\nsight which comes on these occasions.\n\nThe mist cleared, the upside-down, inside-out sensation subsided,\nand there stood the six in a ring, as before, only their twelve feet,\ninstead of standing on the carpet of the learned gentleman’s room, stood\non green grass. Above them, instead of the dusky ceiling of the Fitzroy\nStreet floor, was a pale blue sky. And where the walls had been and the\npainted mummy-case, were tall dark green trees, oaks and ashes, and in\nbetween the trees and under them tangled bushes and creeping ivy. There\nwere beech-trees too, but there was nothing under them but their own\ndead red drifted leaves, and here and there a delicate green fern-frond.\n\nAnd there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though they\nwere playing Ring-o’-Roses or the Mulberry Bush. Just six people hand in\nhand in a wood. That sounds simple, but then you must remember that they\ndid not know WHERE the wood was, and what’s more, they didn’t know WHEN\nthen wood was. There was a curious sort of feeling that made the learned\ngentleman say--\n\n‘Another dream, dear me!’ and made the children almost certain that they\nwere in a time a very long while ago. As for little Imogen, she said,\n‘Oh, my!’ and kept her mouth very much open indeed.\n\n‘Where are we?’ Cyril asked the Psammead.\n\n‘In Britain,’ said the Psammead.\n\n‘But when?’ asked Anthea anxiously.\n\n‘About the year fifty-five before the year you reckon time from,’ said\nthe Psammead crossly. ‘Is there anything else you want to know?’ it\nadded, sticking its head out of the bag formed by Anthea’s blue linen\nfrock, and turning its snail’s eyes to right and left. ‘I’ve been here\nbefore--it’s very little changed.’ ‘Yes, but why here?’ asked Anthea.\n\n‘Your inconsiderate friend,’ the Psammead replied, ‘wished to find some\nhome where they would be glad to have that unattractive and immature\nfemale human being whom you have picked up--gracious knows how. In\nMegatherium days properly brought-up children didn’t talk to shabby\nstrangers in parks. Your thoughtless friend wanted a place where someone\nwould be glad to have this undesirable stranger. And now here you are!’\n\n‘I see we are,’ said Anthea patiently, looking round on the tall gloom\nof the forest. ‘But why HERE? Why NOW?’\n\n‘You don’t suppose anyone would want a child like that in YOUR times--in\nYOUR towns?’ said the Psammead in irritated tones. ‘You’ve got\nyour country into such a mess that there’s no room for half your\nchildren--and no one to want them.’\n\n‘That’s not our doing, you know,’ said Anthea gently.\n\n‘And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything,’ said the\nPsammead still more crossly, ‘when everyone knows how damp and foggy\nAncient Britain was.’\n\n‘Here, take my coat,’ said Robert, taking it off. Anthea spread the coat\non the ground and, putting the Psammead on it, folded it round so that\nonly the eyes and furry ears showed.\n\n‘There,’ she said comfortingly. ‘Now if it does begin to look like rain,\nI can cover you up in a minute. Now what are we to do?’\n\nThe others who had stopped holding hands crowded round to hear the\nanswer to this question. Imogen whispered in an awed tone--\n\n‘Can’t the organ monkey talk neither! I thought it was only parrots!’\n\n‘Do?’ replied the Psammead. ‘I don’t care what you do!’ And it drew head\nand ears into the tweed covering of Robert’s coat.\n\nThe others looked at each other.\n\n‘It’s only a dream,’ said the learned gentleman hopefully; ‘something is\nsure to happen if we can prevent ourselves from waking up.’\n\nAnd sure enough, something did.\n\nThe brooding silence of the dark forest was broken by the laughter of\nchildren and the sound of voices.\n\n‘Let’s go and see,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘It’s only a dream,’ said the learned gentleman to Jane, who hung back;\n‘if you don’t go with the tide of a dream--if you resist--you wake up,\nyou know.’\n\nThere was a sort of break in the undergrowth that was like a silly\nperson’s idea of a path. They went along this in Indian file, the\nlearned gentleman leading.\n\nQuite soon they came to a large clearing in the forest. There were a\nnumber of houses--huts perhaps you would have called them--with a sort\nof mud and wood fence.\n\n‘It’s like the old Egyptian town,’ whispered Anthea.\n\nAnd it was, rather.\n\nSome children, with no clothes on at all, were playing what looked like\nRing-o’-Roses or Mulberry Bush. That is to say, they were dancing round\nin a ring, holding hands. On a grassy bank several women, dressed in\nblue and white robes and tunics of beast-skins sat watching the playing\nchildren.\n\nThe children from Fitzroy Street stood on the fringe of the forest\nlooking at the games. One woman with long, fair braided hair sat a\nlittle apart from the others, and there was a look in her eyes as she\nfollowed the play of the children that made Anthea feel sad and sorry.\n\n‘None of those little girls is her own little girl,’ thought Anthea.\n\nThe little black-clad London child pulled at Anthea’s sleeve.\n\n‘Look,’ she said, ‘that one there--she’s precious like mother; mother’s\n‘air was somethink lovely, when she ‘ad time to comb it out. Mother\nwouldn’t never a-beat me if she’d lived ‘ere--I don’t suppose there’s\ne’er a public nearer than Epping, do you, Miss?’\n\nIn her eagerness the child had stepped out of the shelter of the forest.\nThe sad-eyed woman saw her. She stood up, her thin face lighted up\nwith a radiance like sunrise, her long, lean arms stretched towards the\nLondon child.\n\n‘Imogen!’ she cried--at least the word was more like that than any other\nword--‘Imogen!’\n\nThere was a moment of great silence; the naked children paused in their\nplay, the women on the bank stared anxiously.\n\n‘Oh, it IS mother--it IS!’ cried Imogen-from-London, and rushed across\nthe cleared space. She and her mother clung together--so closely, so\nstrongly that they stood an instant like a statue carved in stone.\n\nThen the women crowded round. ‘It IS my Imogen!’ cried the woman.\n\n‘Oh it is! And she wasn’t eaten by wolves. She’s come back to me. Tell\nme, my darling, how did you escape? Where have you been? Who has fed and\nclothed you?’\n\n‘I don’t know nothink,’ said Imogen.\n\n‘Poor child!’ whispered the women who crowded round, ‘the terror of the\nwolves has turned her brain.’\n\n‘But you know ME?’ said the fair-haired woman.\n\nAnd Imogen, clinging with black-clothed arms to the bare neck,\nanswered--\n\n‘Oh, yes, mother, I know YOU right ‘nough.’\n\n‘What is it? What do they say?’ the learned gentleman asked anxiously.\n\n‘You wished to come where someone wanted the child,’ said the Psammead.\n‘The child says this is her mother.’\n\n‘And the mother?’\n\n‘You can see,’ said the Psammead.\n\n‘But is she really? Her child, I mean?’\n\n‘Who knows?’ said the Psammead; ‘but each one fills the empty place in\nthe other’s heart. It is enough.’\n\n‘Oh,’ said the learned gentleman, ‘this is a good dream. I wish the\nchild might stay in the dream.’\n\nThe Psammead blew itself out and granted the wish. So Imogen’s future\nwas assured. She had found someone to want her.\n\n‘If only all the children that no one wants,’ began the learned\ngentleman--but the woman interrupted. She came towards them.\n\n‘Welcome, all!’ she cried. ‘I am the Queen, and my child tells me that\nyou have befriended her; and this I well believe, looking on your faces.\nYour garb is strange, but faces I can read. The child is bewitched, I\nsee that well, but in this she speaks truth. Is it not so?’\n\nThe children said it wasn’t worth mentioning.\n\nI wish you could have seen all the honours and kindnesses lavished on\nthe children and the learned gentleman by those ancient Britons.\n\nYou would have thought, to see them, that a child was something to make\na fuss about, not a bit of rubbish to be hustled about the streets and\nhidden away in the Workhouse. It wasn’t as grand as the entertainment at\nBabylon, but somehow it was more satisfying.\n\n‘I think you children have some wonderful influence on me,’ said the\nlearned gentleman. ‘I never dreamed such dreams before I knew you.’\n\nIt was when they were alone that night under the stars where the Britons\nhad spread a heap Of dried fern for them to sleep on, that Cyril spoke.\n\n‘Well,’ he said, ‘we’ve made it all right for Imogen, and had a jolly\ngood time. I vote we get home again before the fighting begins.’\n\n‘What fighting?’ asked Jane sleepily.\n\n‘Why, Julius Caesar, you little goat,’ replied her kind brother. ‘Don’t\nyou see that if this is the year fifty-five, Julius Caesar may happen at\nany moment.’\n\n‘I thought you liked Caesar,’ said Robert.\n\n‘So I do--in the history. But that’s different from being killed by his\nsoldiers.’\n\n‘If we saw Caesar we might persuade him not to,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘YOU persuade CAESAR,’ Robert laughed.\n\nThe learned gentleman, before anyone could stop him, said, ‘I only wish\nwe could see Caesar some time.’\n\nAnd, of course, in just the little time the Psammead took to blow itself\nout for wish-giving, the five, or six counting the Psammead, found\nthemselves in Caesar’s camp, just outside Caesar’s tent. And they saw\nCaesar. The Psammead must have taken advantage of the loose wording of\nthe learned gentleman’s wish, for it was not the same time of day as\nthat on which the wish had been uttered among the dried ferns. It was\nsunset, and the great man sat on a chair outside his tent gazing over\nthe sea towards Britain--everyone knew without being told that it was\ntowards Britain. Two golden eagles on the top of posts stood on each\nside of the tent, and on the flaps of the tent which was very gorgeous\nto look at were the letters S.P.Q.R.\n\nThe great man turned unchanged on the newcomers the august glance that\nhe had turned on the violet waters of the Channel. Though they had\nsuddenly appeared out of nothing, Caesar never showed by the faintest\nmovement of an eyelid, by the least tightening of that firm mouth, that\nthey were not some long expected embassy. He waved a calm hand towards\nthe sentinels, who sprang weapons in hand towards the newcomers.\n\n‘Back!’ he said in a voice that thrilled like music. ‘Since when has\nCaesar feared children and students?’\n\nTo the children he seemed to speak in the only language they knew;\nbut the learned gentleman heard--in rather a strange accent, but quite\nintelligibly--the lips of Caesar speaking in the Latin tongue, and in\nthat tongue, a little stiffly, he answered--\n\n‘It is a dream, O Caesar.’\n\n‘A dream?’ repeated Caesar. ‘What is a dream?’\n\n‘This,’ said the learned gentleman.\n\n‘Not it,’ said Cyril, ‘it’s a sort of magic. We come out of another time\nand another place.’\n\n‘And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering Britain,’ said\nAnthea; ‘it’s a poor little place, not worth bothering about.’\n\n‘Are you from Britain?’ the General asked. ‘Your clothes are uncouth,\nbut well woven, and your hair is short as the hair of Roman citizens,\nnot long like the hair of barbarians, yet such I deem you to be.’ ‘We’re\nnot,’ said Jane with angry eagerness; ‘we’re not barbarians at all. We\ncome from the country where the sun never sets, and we’ve read about\nyou in books; and our country’s full of fine things--St Paul’s, and the\nTower of London, and Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition, and--’ Then the others\nstopped her.\n\n‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Robert in a bitter undertone.\n\nCaesar looked at the children a moment in silence. Then he called a\nsoldier and spoke with him apart. Then he said aloud--\n\n‘You three elder children may go where you will within the camp. Few\nchildren are privileged to see the camp of Caesar. The student and the\nsmaller girl-child will remain here with me.’\n\nNobody liked this; but when Caesar said a thing that thing was so, and\nthere was an end to it. So the three went.\n\nLeft alone with Jane and the learned gentleman, the great Roman found it\neasy enough to turn them inside out. But it was not easy, even for him,\nto make head or tail of the insides of their minds when he had got at\nthem.\n\nThe learned gentleman insisted that the whole thing was a dream, and\nrefused to talk much, on the ground that if he did he would wake up.\n\nJane, closely questioned, was full of information about railways,\nelectric lights, balloons, men-of-war, cannons, and dynamite.\n\n‘And do they fight with swords?’ asked the General.\n\n‘Yes, swords and guns and cannons.’\n\nCaesar wanted to know what guns were.\n\n‘You fire them,’ said Jane, ‘and they go bang, and people fall down\ndead.’\n\n‘But what are guns like?’\n\nJane found them hard to describe.\n\n‘But Robert has a toy one in his pocket,’ she said. So the others were\nrecalled.\n\nThe boys explained the pistol to Caesar very fully, and he looked at it\nwith the greatest interest. It was a two-shilling pistol, the one that\nhad done such good service in the old Egyptian village.\n\n‘I shall cause guns to be made,’ said Caesar, ‘and you will be detained\ntill I know whether you have spoken the truth. I had just decided that\nBritain was not worth the bother of invading. But what you tell me\ndecides me that it is very much worth while.’\n\n‘But it’s all nonsense,’ said Anthea. ‘Britain is just a savage sort of\nisland--all fogs and trees and big rivers. But the people are kind. We\nknow a little girl there named Imogen. And it’s no use your making\nguns because you can’t fire them without gunpowder, and that won’t be\ninvented for hundreds of years, and we don’t know how to make it, and\nwe can’t tell you. Do go straight home, dear Caesar, and let poor little\nBritain alone.’\n\n‘But this other girl-child says--’ said Caesar.\n\n‘All Jane’s been telling you is what it’s going to be,’ Anthea\ninterrupted, ‘hundreds and hundreds of years from now.’\n\n‘The little one is a prophetess, eh?’ said Caesar, with a whimsical\nlook. ‘Rather young for the business, isn’t she?’\n\n‘You can call her a prophetess if you like,’ said Cyril, ‘but what\nAnthea says is true.’\n\n‘Anthea?’ said Caesar. ‘That’s a Greek name.’\n\n‘Very likely,’ said Cyril, worriedly. ‘I say, I do wish you’d give up\nthis idea of conquering Britain. It’s not worth while, really it isn’t!’\n\n‘On the contrary,’ said Caesar, ‘what you’ve told me has decided me to\ngo, if it’s only to find out what Britain is really like. Guards, detain\nthese children.’\n\n‘Quick,’ said Robert, ‘before the guards begin detaining. We had enough\nof that in Babylon.’\n\nJane held up the Amulet away from the sunset, and said the word. The\nlearned gentleman was pushed through and the others more quickly than\never before passed through the arch back into their own times and the\nquiet dusty sitting-room of the learned gentleman.\n\n\nIt is a curious fact that when Caesar was encamped on the coast of\nGaul--somewhere near Boulogne it was, I believe--he was sitting before\nhis tent in the glow of the sunset, looking out over the violet waters\nof the English Channel. Suddenly he started, rubbed his eyes, and called\nhis secretary. The young man came quickly from within the tent.\n\n‘Marcus,’ said Caesar. ‘I have dreamed a very wonderful dream. Some\nof it I forget, but I remember enough to decide what was not before\ndetermined. Tomorrow the ships that have been brought round from the\nLigeris shall be provisioned. We shall sail for this three-cornered\nisland. First, we will take but two legions.\n\nThis, if what we have heard be true, should suffice. But if my dream be\ntrue, then a hundred legions will not suffice. For the dream I dreamed\nwas the most wonderful that ever tormented the brain even of Caesar. And\nCaesar has dreamed some strange things in his time.’\n\n\n‘And if you hadn’t told Caesar all that about how things are now, he’d\nnever have invaded Britain,’ said Robert to Jane as they sat down to\ntea.\n\n‘Oh, nonsense,’ said Anthea, pouring out; ‘it was all settled hundreds\nof years ago.’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ said Cyril. ‘Jam, please. This about time being only\na thingummy of thought is very confusing. If everything happens at the\nsame time--’\n\n‘It CAN’T!’ said Anthea stoutly, ‘the present’s the present and the\npast’s the past.’\n\n‘Not always,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘When we were in the Past the present was the future. Now then!’ he\nadded triumphantly.\n\nAnd Anthea could not deny it.\n\n‘I should have liked to see more of the camp,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Yes, we didn’t get much for our money--but Imogen is happy, that’s one\nthing,’ said Anthea. ‘We left her happy in the Past. I’ve often seen\nabout people being happy in the Past, in poetry books. I see what it\nmeans now.’\n\n‘It’s not a bad idea,’ said the Psammead sleepily, putting its head out\nof its bag and taking it in again suddenly, ‘being left in the Past.’\n\nEveryone remembered this afterwards, when--\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. BEFORE PHARAOH\n\nIt was the day after the adventure of Julius Caesar and the Little Black\nGirl that Cyril, bursting into the bathroom to wash his hands for\ndinner (you have no idea how dirty they were, for he had been playing\nshipwrecked mariners all the morning on the leads at the back of the\nhouse, where the water-cistern is), found Anthea leaning her elbows on\nthe edge of the bath, and crying steadily into it.\n\n‘Hullo!’ he said, with brotherly concern, ‘what’s up now? Dinner’ll be\ncold before you’ve got enough salt-water for a bath.’\n\n‘Go away,’ said Anthea fiercely. ‘I hate you! I hate everybody!’\n\nThere was a stricken pause.\n\n‘_I_ didn’t know,’ said Cyril tamely.\n\n‘Nobody ever does know anything,’ sobbed Anthea.\n\n‘I didn’t know you were waxy. I thought you’d just hurt your fingers\nwith the tap again like you did last week,’ Cyril carefully explained.\n\n‘Oh--fingers!’ sneered Anthea through her sniffs.\n\n‘Here, drop it, Panther,’ he said uncomfortably. ‘You haven’t been\nhaving a row or anything?’\n\n‘No,’ she said. ‘Wash your horrid hands, for goodness’ sake, if that’s\nwhat you came for, or go.’\n\nAnthea was so seldom cross that when she was cross the others were\nalways more surprised than angry.\n\nCyril edged along the side of the bath and stood beside her. He put his\nhand on her arm.\n\n‘Dry up, do,’ he said, rather tenderly for him. And, finding that though\nshe did not at once take his advice she did not seem to resent it, he\nput his arm awkwardly across her shoulders and rubbed his head against\nher ear.\n\n‘There!’ he said, in the tone of one administering a priceless cure for\nall possible sorrows. ‘Now, what’s up?’\n\n‘Promise you won’t laugh?’\n\n‘I don’t feel laughish myself,’ said Cyril, dismally.\n\n‘Well, then,’ said Anthea, leaning her ear against his head, ‘it’s\nMother.’\n\n‘What’s the matter with Mother?’ asked Cyril, with apparent want of\nsympathy. ‘She was all right in her letter this morning.’\n\n‘Yes; but I want her so.’\n\n‘You’re not the only one,’ said Cyril briefly, and the brevity of his\ntone admitted a good deal.\n\n‘Oh, yes,’ said Anthea, ‘I know. We all want her all the time. But I\nwant her now most dreadfully, awfully much. I never wanted anything so\nmuch. That Imogen child--the way the ancient British Queen cuddled her\nup! And Imogen wasn’t me, and the Queen was Mother. And then her letter\nthis morning! And about The Lamb liking the salt bathing! And she bathed\nhim in this very bath the night before she went away--oh, oh, oh!’\n\nCyril thumped her on the back.\n\n‘Cheer up,’ he said. ‘You know my inside thinking that I was doing?\nWell, that was partly about Mother. We’ll soon get her back. If you’ll\nchuck it, like a sensible kid, and wash your face, I’ll tell you about\nit. That’s right. You let me get to the tap. Can’t you stop crying?\nShall I put the door-key down your back?’\n\n‘That’s for noses,’ said Anthea, ‘and I’m not a kid any more than you\nare,’ but she laughed a little, and her mouth began to get back into its\nproper shape. You know what an odd shape your mouth gets into when you\ncry in earnest.\n\n‘Look here,’ said Cyril, working the soap round and round between his\nhands in a thick slime of grey soapsuds. ‘I’ve been thinking. We’ve only\njust PLAYED with the Amulet so far. We’ve got to work it now--WORK it\nfor all it’s worth. And it isn’t only Mother either. There’s Father out\nthere all among the fighting. I don’t howl about it, but I THINK--Oh,\nbother the soap!’ The grey-lined soap had squirted out under the\npressure of his fingers, and had hit Anthea’s chin with as much force as\nthough it had been shot from a catapult.\n\n‘There now,’ she said regretfully, ‘now I shall have to wash my face.’\n\n‘You’d have had to do that anyway,’ said Cyril with conviction. ‘Now, my\nidea’s this. You know missionaries?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea, who did not know a single one.\n\n‘Well, they always take the savages beads and brandy, and stays, and\nhats, and braces, and really useful things--things the savages haven’t\ngot, and never heard about. And the savages love them for their\nkind generousness, and give them pearls, and shells, and ivory, and\ncassowaries. And that’s the way--’\n\n‘Wait a sec,’ said Anthea, splashing. ‘I can’t hear what you’re saying.\nShells and--’\n\n‘Shells, and things like that. The great thing is to get people to love\nyou by being generous. And that’s what we’ve got to do. Next time we go\ninto the Past we’ll regularly fit out the expedition. You remember how\nthe Babylonian Queen froze on to that pocket-book? Well, we’ll take\nthings like that. And offer them in exchange for a sight of the Amulet.’\n\n‘A sight of it is not much good.’\n\n‘No, silly. But, don’t you see, when we’ve seen it we shall know where\nit is, and we can go and take it in the night when everybody is asleep.’\n\n‘It wouldn’t be stealing, would it?’ said Anthea thoughtfully, ‘because\nit will be such an awfully long time ago when we do it. Oh, there’s that\nbell again.’\n\nAs soon as dinner was eaten (it was tinned salmon and lettuce, and a jam\ntart), and the cloth cleared away, the idea was explained to the others,\nand the Psammead was aroused from sand, and asked what it thought would\nbe good merchandise with which to buy the affection of say, the Ancient\nEgyptians, and whether it thought the Amulet was likely to be found in\nthe Court of Pharaoh.\n\nBut it shook its head, and shot out its snail’s eyes hopelessly.\n\n‘I’m not allowed to play in this game,’ it said. ‘Of course I COULD find\nout in a minute where the thing was, only I mayn’t. But I may go so far\nas to own that your idea of taking things with you isn’t a bad one. And\nI shouldn’t show them all at once. Take small things and conceal them\ncraftily about your persons.’\n\nThis advice seemed good. Soon the table was littered over with things\nwhich the children thought likely to interest the Ancient Egyptians.\nAnthea brought dolls, puzzle blocks, a wooden tea-service, a green\nleather case with Necessaire written on it in gold letters. Aunt\nEmma had once given it to Anthea, and it had then contained scissors,\npenknife, bodkin, stiletto, thimble, corkscrew, and glove-buttoner. The\nscissors, knife, and thimble, and penknife were, of course, lost, but\nthe other things were there and as good as new. Cyril contributed lead\nsoldiers, a cannon, a catapult, a tin-opener, a tie-clip, and a tennis\nball, and a padlock--no key. Robert collected a candle [‘I don’t suppose\nthey ever saw a self-fitting paraffin one,’ he said), a penny Japanese\npin-tray, a rubber stamp with his father’s name and address on it, and a\npiece of putty.\n\nJane added a key-ring, the brass handle of a poker, a pot that had held\ncold-cream, a smoked pearl button off her winter coat, and a key--no\nlock.\n\n‘We can’t take all this rubbish,’ said Robert, with some scorn. ‘We must\njust each choose one thing.’\n\nThe afternoon passed very agreeably in the attempt to choose from the\ntable the four most suitable objects. But the four children could not\nagree what was suitable, and at last Cyril said--\n\n‘Look here, let’s each be blindfolded and reach out, and the first thing\nyou touch you stick to.’\n\nThis was done.\n\nCyril touched the padlock.\n\nAnthea got the Necessaire.\n\nRobert clutched the candle.\n\nJane picked up the tie-clip.\n\n‘It’s not much,’ she said. ‘I don’t believe Ancient Egyptians wore\nties.’\n\n‘Never mind,’ said Anthea. ‘I believe it’s luckier not to really choose.\nIn the stories it’s always the thing the wood-cutter’s son picks up in\nthe forest, and almost throws away because he thinks it’s no good, that\nturns out to be the magic thing in the end; or else someone’s lost it,\nand he is rewarded with the hand of the King’s daughter in marriage.’\n\n‘I don’t want any hands in marriage, thank you.’ said Cyril firmly.\n\n‘Nor yet me,’ said Robert. ‘It’s always the end of the adventures when\nit comes to the marriage hands.’\n\n‘ARE we ready?’ said Anthea.\n\n‘It IS Egypt we’re going to, isn’t it?--nice Egypt?’ said Jane. ‘I\nwon’t go anywhere I don’t know about--like that dreadful big-wavy\nburning-mountain city,’ she insisted.\n\nThen the Psammead was coaxed into its bag. ‘I say,’ said Cyril suddenly,\n‘I’m rather sick of kings. And people notice you so in palaces. Besides\nthe Amulet’s sure to be in a Temple. Let’s just go among the common\npeople, and try to work ourselves up by degrees. We might get taken on\nas Temple assistants.’\n\n‘Like beadles,’ said Anthea, ‘or vergers. They must have splendid\nchances of stealing the Temple treasures.’\n\n‘Righto!’ was the general rejoinder. The charm was held up. It grew big\nonce again, and once again the warm golden Eastern light glowed softly\nbeyond it.\n\nAs the children stepped through it loud and furious voices rang in their\nears. They went suddenly from the quiet of Fitzroy Street dining-room\ninto a very angry Eastern crowd, a crowd much too angry to notice them.\nThey edged through it to the wall of a house and stood there. The crowd\nwas of men, women, and children. They were of all sorts of complexions,\nand pictures of them might have been coloured by any child with\na shilling paint-box. The colours that child would have used for\ncomplexions would have been yellow ochre, red ochre, light red, sepia,\nand indian ink. But their faces were painted already--black eyebrows\nand lashes, and some red lips. The women wore a sort of pinafore with\nshoulder straps, and loose things wound round their heads and shoulders.\nThe men wore very little clothing--for they were the working people--and\nthe Egyptian boys and girls wore nothing at all, unless you count\nthe little ornaments hung on chains round their necks and waists. The\nchildren saw all this before they could hear anything distinctly.\n\nEveryone was shouting so.\n\nBut a voice sounded above the other voices, and presently it was\nspeaking in a silence.\n\n‘Comrades and fellow workers,’ it said, and it was the voice of a\ntall, coppery-coloured man who had climbed into a chariot that had been\nstopped by the crowd. Its owner had bolted, muttering something about\ncalling the Guards, and now the man spoke from it. ‘Comrades and fellow\nworkers, how long are we to endure the tyranny of our masters, who live\nin idleness and luxury on the fruit of our toil? They only give us a\nbare subsistence wage, and they live on the fat of the land. We labour\nall our lives to keep them in wanton luxury. Let us make an end of it!’\n\nA roar of applause answered him.\n\n‘How are you going to do it?’ cried a voice.\n\n‘You look out,’ cried another, ‘or you’ll get yourself into trouble.’\n\n‘I’ve heard almost every single word of that,’ whispered Robert, ‘in\nHyde Park last Sunday!’\n\n‘Let us strike for more bread and onions and beer, and a longer mid-day\nrest,’ the speaker went on. ‘You are tired, you are hungry, you are\nthirsty. You are poor, your wives and children are pining for food. The\nbarns of the rich are full to bursting with the corn we want, the corn\nour labour has grown. To the granaries!’\n\n‘To the granaries!’ cried half the crowd; but another voice shouted\nclear above the tumult, ‘To Pharaoh! To the King! Let’s present a\npetition to the King! He will listen to the voice of the oppressed!’\n\nFor a moment the crowd swayed one way and another--first towards the\ngranaries and then towards the palace. Then, with a rush like that of an\nimprisoned torrent suddenly set free, it surged along the street towards\nthe palace, and the children were carried with it. Anthea found it\ndifficult to keep the Psammead from being squeezed very uncomfortably.\n\nThe crowd swept through the streets of dull-looking houses with few\nwindows, very high up, across the market where people were not buying\nbut exchanging goods. In a momentary pause Robert saw a basket of onions\nexchanged for a hair comb and five fish for a string of beads. The\npeople in the market seemed better off than those in the crowd; they\nhad finer clothes, and more of them. They were the kind of people who,\nnowadays, would have lived at Brixton or Brockley.\n\n‘What’s the trouble now?’ a languid, large-eyed lady in a crimped,\nhalf-transparent linen dress, with her black hair very much braided and\npuffed out, asked of a date-seller.\n\n‘Oh, the working-men--discontented as usual,’ the man answered. ‘Listen\nto them. Anyone would think it mattered whether they had a little more\nor less to eat. Dregs of society!’ said the date-seller.\n\n‘Scum!’ said the lady.\n\n‘And I’ve heard THAT before, too,’ said Robert.\n\nAt that moment the voice of the crowd changed, from anger to doubt, from\ndoubt to fear. There were other voices shouting; they shouted defiance\nand menace, and they came nearer very quickly. There was the rattle of\nwheels and the pounding of hoofs. A voice shouted, ‘Guards!’\n\n‘The Guards! The Guards!’ shouted another voice, and the crowd of\nworkmen took up the cry. ‘The Guards! Pharaoh’s Guards!’ And swaying a\nlittle once more, the crowd hung for a moment as it were balanced. Then\nas the trampling hoofs came nearer the workmen fled dispersed, up alleys\nand into the courts of houses, and the Guards in their embossed leather\nchariots swept down the street at the gallop, their wheels clattering\nover the stones, and their dark-coloured, blue tunics blown open and\nback with the wind of their going.\n\n‘So THAT riot’s over,’ said the crimped-linen-dressed lady; ‘that’s\na blessing! And did you notice the Captain of the Guard? What a very\nhandsome man he was, to be sure!’\n\nThe four children had taken advantage of the moment’s pause before the\ncrowd turned to fly, to edge themselves and drag each other into an\narched doorway.\n\nNow they each drew a long breath and looked at the others.\n\n‘We’re well out of THAT,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea, ‘but I do wish the poor men hadn’t been driven back\nbefore they could get to the King. He might have done something for\nthem.’\n\n‘Not if he was the one in the Bible he wouldn’t,’ said Jane. ‘He had a\nhard heart.’ ‘Ah, that was the Moses one,’ Anthea explained. ‘The Joseph\none was quite different. I should like to see Pharaoh’s house. I wonder\nwhether it’s like the Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace.’\n\n‘I thought we decided to try to get taken on in a Temple,’ said Cyril in\ninjured tones.\n\n‘Yes, but we’ve got to know someone first. Couldn’t we make friends\nwith a Temple doorkeeper--we might give him the padlock or something. I\nwonder which are temples and which are palaces,’ Robert added, glancing\nacross the market-place to where an enormous gateway with huge side\nbuildings towered towards the sky. To right and left of it were other\nbuildings only a little less magnificent.\n\n‘Did you wish to seek out the Temple of Amen Ra?’ asked a soft voice\nbehind them, ‘or the Temple of Mut, or the Temple of Khonsu?’\n\nThey turned to find beside them a young man. He was shaved clean from\nhead to foot, and on his feet were light papyrus sandals. He was clothed\nin a linen tunic of white, embroidered heavily in colours. He was gay\nwith anklets, bracelets, and armlets of gold, richly inlaid. He wore\na ring on his finger, and he had a short jacket of gold embroidery\nsomething like the Zouave soldiers wear, and on his neck was a gold\ncollar with many amulets hanging from it. But among the amulets the\nchildren could see none like theirs.\n\n‘It doesn’t matter which Temple,’ said Cyril frankly.\n\n‘Tell me your mission,’ said the young man. ‘I am a divine father of the\nTemple of Amen Ra and perhaps I can help you.’\n\n‘Well,’ said Cyril, ‘we’ve come from the great Empire on which the sun\nnever sets.’\n\n‘I thought somehow that you’d come from some odd, out-of-the-way spot,’\nsaid the priest with courtesy.\n\n‘And we’ve seen a good many palaces. We thought we should like to see a\nTemple, for a change,’ said Robert.\n\nThe Psammead stirred uneasily in its embroidered bag.\n\n‘Have you brought gifts to the Temple?’ asked the priest cautiously.\n\n‘We HAVE got some gifts,’ said Cyril with equal caution. ‘You see\nthere’s magic mixed up in it. So we can’t tell you everything. But we\ndon’t want to give our gifts for nothing.’\n\n‘Beware how you insult the god,’ said the priest sternly. ‘I also can\ndo magic. I can make a waxen image of you, and I can say words which, as\nthe wax image melts before the fire, will make you dwindle away and at\nlast perish miserably.’\n\n‘Pooh!’ said Cyril stoutly, ‘that’s nothing. _I_ can make FIRE itself!’\n\n‘I should jolly well like to see you do it,’ said the priest\nunbelievingly.\n\n‘Well, you shall,’ said Cyril, ‘nothing easier. Just stand close round\nme.’\n\n‘Do you need no preparation--no fasting, no incantations?’ The priest’s\ntone was incredulous.\n\n‘The incantation’s quite short,’ said Cyril, taking the hint; ‘and as\nfor fasting, it’s not needed in MY sort of magic. Union Jack, Printing\nPress, Gunpowder, Rule Britannia! Come, Fire, at the end of this little\nstick!’\n\nHe had pulled a match from his pocket, and as he ended the incantation\nwhich contained no words that it seemed likely the Egyptian had ever\nheard he stooped in the little crowd of his relations and the priest and\nstruck the match on his boot. He stood up, shielding the flame with one\nhand.\n\n‘See?’ he said, with modest pride. ‘Here, take it into your hand.’\n\n‘No, thank you,’ said the priest, swiftly backing. ‘Can you do that\nagain?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Then come with me to the great double house of Pharaoh. He loves good\nmagic, and he will raise you to honour and glory. There’s no need of\nsecrets between initiates,’ he went on confidentially. ‘The fact is,\nI am out of favour at present owing to a little matter of failure of\nprophecy. I told him a beautiful princess would be sent to him from\nSyria, and, lo! a woman thirty years old arrived. But she WAS a\nbeautiful woman not so long ago. Time is only a mode of thought, you\nknow.’\n\nThe children thrilled to the familiar words.\n\n‘So you know that too, do you?’ said Cyril.\n\n‘It is part of the mystery of all magic, is it not?’ said the priest.\n‘Now if I bring you to Pharaoh the little unpleasantness I spoke of will\nbe forgotten. And I will ask Pharaoh, the Great House, Son of the Sun,\nand Lord of the South and North, to decree that you shall lodge in the\nTemple. Then you can have a good look round, and teach me your magic.\nAnd I will teach you mine.’\n\nThis idea seemed good--at least it was better than any other which at\nthat moment occurred to anybody, so they followed the priest through the\ncity.\n\nThe streets were very narrow and dirty. The best houses, the priest\nexplained, were built within walls twenty to twenty-five feet high,\nand such windows as showed in the walls were very high up. The tops of\npalm-trees showed above the walls. The poor people’s houses were little\nsquare huts with a door and two windows, and smoke coming out of a hole\nin the back.\n\n‘The poor Egyptians haven’t improved so very much in their building\nsince the first time we came to Egypt,’ whispered Cyril to Anthea.\n\nThe huts were roofed with palm branches, and everywhere there were\nchickens, and goats, and little naked children kicking about in the\nyellow dust. On one roof was a goat, who had climbed up and was eating\nthe dry palm-leaves with snorts and head-tossings of delight. Over every\nhouse door was some sort of figure or shape.\n\n‘Amulets,’ the priest explained, ‘to keep off the evil eye.’\n\n‘I don’t think much of your “nice Egypt”,’ Robert whispered to Jane;\n‘it’s simply not a patch on Babylon.’\n\n‘Ah, you wait till you see the palace,’ Jane whispered back.\n\nThe palace was indeed much more magnificent than anything they had yet\nseen that day, though it would have made but a poor show beside that\nof the Babylonian King. They came to it through a great square pillared\ndoorway of sandstone that stood in a high brick wall. The shut doors\nwere of massive cedar, with bronze hinges, and were studded with bronze\nnails. At the side was a little door and a wicket gate, and through\nthis the priest led the children. He seemed to know a word that made the\nsentries make way for him.\n\nInside was a garden, planted with hundreds of different kinds of trees\nand flowering shrubs, a lake full of fish, with blue lotus flowers at\nthe margin, and ducks swimming about cheerfully, and looking, as Jane\nsaid, quite modern.\n\n‘The guard-chamber, the store-houses, the queen’s house,’ said the\npriest, pointing them out.\n\nThey passed through open courtyards, paved with flat stones, and the\npriest whispered to a guard at a great inner gate.\n\n‘We are fortunate,’ he said to the children, ‘Pharaoh is even now in\nthe Court of Honour. Now, don’t forget to be overcome with respect and\nadmiration. It won’t do any harm if you fall flat on your faces. And\nwhatever you do, don’t speak until you’re spoken to.’\n\n‘There used to be that rule in our country,’ said Robert, ‘when my\nfather was a little boy.’\n\nAt the outer end of the great hall a crowd of people were arguing with\nand even shoving the Guards, who seemed to make it a rule not to let\nanyone through unless they were bribed to do it. The children heard\nseveral promises of the utmost richness, and wondered whether they would\never be kept.\n\nAll round the hall were pillars of painted wood. The roof was of cedar,\ngorgeously inlaid. About half-way up the hall was a wide, shallow step\nthat went right across the hall; then a little farther on another; and\nthen a steep flight of narrower steps, leading right up to the throne on\nwhich Pharaoh sat. He sat there very splendid, his red and white double\ncrown on his head, and his sceptre in his hand. The throne had a canopy\nof wood and wooden pillars painted in bright colours. On a low, broad\nbench that ran all round the hall sat the friends, relatives, and\ncourtiers of the King, leaning on richly-covered cushions.\n\nThe priest led the children up the steps till they all stood before the\nthrone; and then, suddenly, he fell on his face with hands outstretched.\nThe others did the same, Anthea falling very carefully because of the\nPsammead.\n\n‘Raise them,’ said the voice of Pharaoh, ‘that they may speak to me.’\n\nThe officers of the King’s household raised them.\n\n‘Who are these strangers?’ Pharaoh asked, and added very crossly, ‘And\nwhat do you mean, Rekh-mara, by daring to come into my presence while\nyour innocence is not established?’\n\n‘Oh, great King,’ said the young priest, ‘you are the very image of\nRa, and the likeness of his son Horus in every respect. You know the\nthoughts of the hearts of the gods and of men, and you have divined\nthat these strangers are the children of the children of the vile and\nconquered Kings of the Empire where the sun never sets. They know a\nmagic not known to the Egyptians. And they come with gifts in their\nhands as tribute to Pharaoh, in whose heart is the wisdom of the gods,\nand on his lips their truth.’\n\n‘That is all very well,’ said Pharaoh, ‘but where are the gifts?’\n\nThe children, bowing as well as they could in their embarrassment at\nfinding themselves the centre of interest in a circle more grand, more\ngolden and more highly coloured than they could have imagined possible,\npulled out the padlock, the Necessaire, and the tie-clip. ‘But it’s not\ntribute all the same,’ Cyril muttered. ‘England doesn’t pay tribute!’\n\nPharaoh examined all the things with great interest when the chief of\nthe household had taken them up to him. ‘Deliver them to the Keeper of\nthe Treasury,’ he said to one near him. And to the children he said--\n\n‘A small tribute, truly, but strange, and not without worth. And the\nmagic, O Rekh-mara?’\n\n‘These unworthy sons of a conquered nation...’ began Rekh-mara.\n\n‘Nothing of the kind!’ Cyril whispered angrily.\n\n‘... of a vile and conquered nation, can make fire to spring from dry\nwood--in the sight of all.’\n\n‘I should jolly well like to see them do it,’ said Pharaoh, just as the\npriest had done.\n\nSo Cyril, without more ado, did it.\n\n‘Do more magic,’ said the King, with simple appreciation.\n\n‘He cannot do any more magic,’ said Anthea suddenly, and all eyes were\nturned on her, ‘because of the voice of the free people who are shouting\nfor bread and onions and beer and a long mid-day rest. If the people had\nwhat they wanted, he could do more.’\n\n‘A rude-spoken girl,’ said Pharaoh. ‘But give the dogs what they want,’\nhe said, without turning his head. ‘Let them have their rest and their\nextra rations. There are plenty of slaves to work.’\n\nA richly-dressed official hurried out.\n\n‘You will be the idol of the people,’ Rekh-mara whispered joyously; ‘the\nTemple of Amen will not contain their offerings.’\n\nCyril struck another match, and all the court was overwhelmed with\ndelight and wonder. And when Cyril took the candle from his pocket and\nlighted it with the match, and then held the burning candle up before\nthe King the enthusiasm knew no bounds.\n\n‘Oh, greatest of all, before whom sun and moon and stars bow down,’ said\nRekh-mara insinuatingly, ‘am I pardoned? Is my innocence made plain?’\n\n‘As plain as it ever will be, I daresay,’ said Pharaoh shortly. ‘Get\nalong with you. You are pardoned. Go in peace.’ The priest went with\nlightning swiftness.\n\n‘And what,’ said the King suddenly, ‘is it that moves in that sack?\n\nShow me, oh strangers.’\n\nThere was nothing for it but to show the Psammead.\n\n‘Seize it,’ said Pharaoh carelessly. ‘A very curious monkey. It will be\na nice little novelty for my wild beast collection.’\n\nAnd instantly, the entreaties of the children availing as little as the\nbites of the Psammead, though both bites and entreaties were fervent, it\nwas carried away from before their eyes.\n\n‘Oh, DO be careful!’ cried Anthea. ‘At least keep it dry! Keep it in its\nsacred house!’\n\nShe held up the embroidered bag.\n\n‘It’s a magic creature,’ cried Robert; ‘it’s simply priceless!’\n\n‘You’ve no right to take it away,’ cried Jane incautiously. ‘It’s a\nshame, a barefaced robbery, that’s what it is!’\n\nThere was an awful silence. Then Pharaoh spoke.\n\n‘Take the sacred house of the beast from them,’ he said, ‘and imprison\nall. Tonight after supper it may be our pleasure to see more magic.\nGuard them well, and do not torture them--yet!’\n\n‘Oh, dear!’ sobbed Jane, as they were led away. ‘I knew exactly what it\nwould be! Oh, I wish you hadn’t!’\n\n‘Shut up, silly,’ said Cyril. ‘You know you WOULD come to Egypt. It was\nyour own idea entirely. Shut up. It’ll be all right.’\n\n‘I thought we should play ball with queens,’ sobbed Jane, ‘and have no\nend of larks! And now everything’s going to be perfectly horrid!’\n\nThe room they were shut up in WAS a room, and not a dungeon, as the\nelder ones had feared. That, as Anthea said, was one comfort. There\nwere paintings on the wall that at any other time would have been most\ninteresting. And a sort of low couch, and chairs. When they were alone\nJane breathed a sigh of relief. ‘Now we can get home all right,’ she\nsaid.\n\n‘And leave the Psammead?’ said Anthea reproachfully.\n\n‘Wait a sec. I’ve got an idea,’ said Cyril. He pondered for a few\nmoments. Then he began hammering on the heavy cedar door. It opened, and\na guard put in his head.\n\n‘Stop that row,’ he said sternly, ‘or--’\n\n‘Look here,’ Cyril interrupted, ‘it’s very dull for you isn’t it? Just\ndoing nothing but guard us. Wouldn’t you like to see some magic? We’re\nnot too proud to do it for you. Wouldn’t you like to see it?’\n\n‘I don’t mind if I do,’ said the guard.\n\n‘Well then, you get us that monkey of ours that was taken away, and\nwe’ll show you.’\n\n‘How do I know you’re not making game of me?’ asked the soldier.\n‘Shouldn’t wonder if you only wanted to get the creature so as to set it\non me. I daresay its teeth and claws are poisonous.’ ‘Well, look here,’\nsaid Robert. ‘You see we’ve got nothing with us? You just shut the door,\nand open it again in five minutes, and we’ll have got a magic--oh, I\ndon’t know--a magic flower in a pot for you.’\n\n‘If you can do that you can do anything,’ said the soldier, and he went\nout and barred the door.\n\nThen, of course, they held up the Amulet. They found the East by holding\nit up, and turning slowly till the Amulet began to grow big, walked home\nthrough it, and came back with a geranium in full scarlet flower from\nthe staircase window of the Fitzroy Street house.\n\n‘Well!’ said the soldier when he came in. ‘I really am--!’\n\n‘We can do much more wonderful things than that--oh, ever so much,’ said\nAnthea persuasively, ‘if we only have our monkey. And here’s twopence\nfor yourself.’\n\nThe soldier looked at the twopence.\n\n‘What’s this?’ he said.\n\nRobert explained how much simpler it was to pay money for things than\nto exchange them as the people were doing in the market. Later on the\nsoldier gave the coins to his captain, who, later still, showed them to\nPharaoh, who of course kept them and was much struck with the idea.\nThat was really how coins first came to be used in Egypt. You will not\nbelieve this, I daresay, but really, if you believe the rest of the\nstory, I don’t see why you shouldn’t believe this as well.\n\n‘I say,’ said Anthea, struck by a sudden thought, ‘I suppose it’ll be\nall right about those workmen? The King won’t go back on what he said\nabout them just because he’s angry with us?’\n\n‘Oh, no,’ said the soldier, ‘you see, he’s rather afraid of magic. He’ll\nkeep to his word right enough.’\n\n‘Then THAT’S all right,’ said Robert; and Anthea said softly and\ncoaxingly--\n\n‘Ah, DO get us the monkey, and then you’ll see some lovely magic.\nDo--there’s a nice, kind soldier.’\n\n‘I don’t know where they’ve put your precious monkey, but if I can get\nanother chap to take on my duty here I’ll see what I can do,’ he said\ngrudgingly, and went out.\n\n‘Do you mean,’ said Robert, ‘that we’re going off without even TRYING\nfor the other half of the Amulet?’\n\n‘I really think we’d better,’ said Anthea tremulously. ‘Of course the\nother half of the Amulet’s here somewhere or our half wouldn’t have\nbrought us here. I do wish we could find it. It is a pity we don’t\nknow any REAL magic. Then we could find out. I do wonder where it\nis--exactly.’\n\nIf they had only known it, something very like the other half of the\nAmulet was very near them. It hung round the neck of someone, and\nthat someone was watching them through a chink, high up in the wall,\nspecially devised for watching people who were imprisoned. But they did\nnot know.\n\nThere was nearly an hour of anxious waiting. They tried to take an\ninterest in the picture on the wall, a picture of harpers playing\nvery odd harps and women dancing at a feast. They examined the painted\nplaster floor, and the chairs were of white painted wood with coloured\nstripes at intervals.\n\nBut the time went slowly, and everyone had time to think of how Pharaoh\nhad said, ‘Don’t torture them--YET.’\n\n‘If the worst comes to the worst,’ said Cyril, ‘we must just bunk, and\nleave the Psammead. I believe it can take care of itself well enough.\nThey won’t kill it or hurt it when they find it can speak and give\nwishes. They’ll build it a temple, I shouldn’t wonder.’\n\n‘I couldn’t bear to go without it,’ said Anthea, ‘and Pharaoh said\n“After supper”, that won’t be just yet. And the soldier WAS curious. I’m\nsure we’re all right for the present.’\n\nAll the same, the sounds of the door being unbarred seemed one of the\nprettiest sounds possible.\n\n‘Suppose he hasn’t got the Psammead?’ whispered Jane.\n\nBut that doubt was set at rest by the Psammead itself; for almost before\nthe door was open it sprang through the chink of it into Anthea’s arms,\nshivering and hunching up its fur.\n\n‘Here’s its fancy overcoat,’ said the soldier, holding out the bag, into\nwhich the Psammead immediately crept.\n\n‘Now,’ said Cyril, ‘what would you like us to do? Anything you’d like us\nto get for you?’\n\n‘Any little trick you like,’ said the soldier. ‘If you can get a strange\nflower blooming in an earthenware vase you can get anything, I suppose,’\nhe said. ‘I just wish I’d got two men’s loads of jewels from the King’s\ntreasury. That’s what I’ve always wished for.’\n\nAt the word ‘WISH’ the children knew that the Psammead would attend to\nTHAT bit of magic. It did, and the floor was littered with a spreading\nheap of gold and precious stones.\n\n‘Any other little trick?’ asked Cyril loftily. ‘Shall we become\ninvisible? Vanish?’\n\n‘Yes, if you like,’ said the soldier; ‘but not through the door, you\ndon’t.’\n\nHe closed it carefully and set his broad Egyptian back against it.\n\n‘No! no!’ cried a voice high up among the tops of the tall wooden\npillars that stood against the wall. There was a sound of someone moving\nabove.\n\nThe soldier was as much surprised as anybody.\n\n‘That’s magic, if you like,’ he said.\n\nAnd then Jane held up the Amulet, uttering the word of Power. At the\nsound of it and at the sight of the Amulet growing into the great arch\nthe soldier fell flat on his face among the jewels with a cry of awe and\nterror.\n\nThe children went through the arch with a quickness born of long\npractice. But Jane stayed in the middle of the arch and looked back.\n\nThe others, standing on the dining-room carpet in Fitzroy Street, turned\nand saw her still in the arch. ‘Someone’s holding her,’ cried Cyril. ‘We\nmust go back.’\n\nBut they pulled at Jane’s hands just to see if she would come, and, of\ncourse, she did come.\n\nThen, as usual, the arch was little again and there they all were.\n\n‘Oh, I do wish you hadn’t!’ Jane said crossly. ‘It WAS so interesting.\nThe priest had come in and he was kicking the soldier, and telling\nhim he’d done it now, and they must take the jewels and flee for their\nlives.’\n\n‘And did they?’\n\n‘I don’t know. You interfered,’ said Jane ungratefully. ‘I SHOULD have\nliked to see the last of it.’\n\nAs a matter of fact, none of them had seen the last of it--if by ‘it’\nJane meant the adventure of the Priest and the Soldier.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. THE SORRY-PRESENT AND THE EXPELLED LITTLE BOY\n\n‘Look here, said Cyril, sitting on the dining-table and swinging his\nlegs; ‘I really have got it.’\n\n‘Got what?’ was the not unnatural rejoinder of the others.\n\nCyril was making a boat with a penknife and a piece of wood, and the\ngirls were making warm frocks for their dolls, for the weather was\ngrowing chilly.\n\n‘Why, don’t you see? It’s really not any good our going into the Past\nlooking for that Amulet. The Past’s as full of different times as--as\nthe sea is of sand. We’re simply bound to hit upon the wrong time. We\nmight spend our lives looking for the Amulet and never see a sight of\nit. Why, it’s the end of September already. It’s like looking for a\nneedle in--’\n\n‘A bottle of hay--I know,’ interrupted Robert; ‘but if we don’t go on\ndoing that, what ARE we to do?’\n\n‘That’s just it,’ said Cyril in mysterious accents. ‘Oh, BOTHER!’\n\nOld Nurse had come in with the tray of knives, forks, and glasses,\nand was getting the tablecloth and table-napkins out of the chiffonier\ndrawer.\n\n‘It’s always meal-times just when you come to anything interesting.’\n\n‘And a nice interesting handful YOU’D be, Master Cyril,’ said old Nurse,\n‘if I wasn’t to bring your meals up to time. Don’t you begin grumbling\nnow, fear you get something to grumble AT.’\n\n‘I wasn’t grumbling,’ said Cyril quite untruly; ‘but it does always\nhappen like that.’\n\n‘You deserve to HAVE something happen,’ said old Nurse. ‘Slave, slave,\nslave for you day and night, and never a word of thanks. ...’\n\n‘Why, you do everything beautifully,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘It’s the first time any of you’s troubled to say so, anyhow,’ said\nNurse shortly.\n\n‘What’s the use of SAYING?’ inquired Robert. ‘We EAT our meals fast\nenough, and almost always two helps. THAT ought to show you!’\n\n‘Ah!’ said old Nurse, going round the table and putting the knives and\nforks in their places; ‘you’re a man all over, Master Robert. There was\nmy poor Green, all the years he lived with me I never could get more\nout of him than “It’s all right!” when I asked him if he’d fancied his\ndinner. And yet, when he lay a-dying, his last words to me was, “Maria,\nyou was always a good cook!”’ She ended with a trembling voice.\n\n‘And so you are,’ cried Anthea, and she and Jane instantly hugged her.\n\nWhen she had gone out of the room Anthea said--\n\n‘I know exactly how she feels. Now, look here! Let’s do a penance to\nshow we’re sorry we didn’t think about telling her before what nice\ncooking she does, and what a dear she is.’\n\n‘Penances are silly,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Not if the penance is something to please someone else. I didn’t mean\nold peas and hair shirts and sleeping on the stones. I mean we’ll make\nher a sorry-present,’ explained Anthea. ‘Look here! I vote Cyril doesn’t\ntell us his idea until we’ve done something for old Nurse. It’s worse\nfor us than him,’ she added hastily, ‘because he knows what it is and we\ndon’t. Do you all agree?’\n\nThe others would have been ashamed not to agree, so they did. It was not\ntill quite near the end of dinner--mutton fritters and blackberry and\napple pie--that out of the earnest talk of the four came an idea that\npleased everybody and would, they hoped, please Nurse.\n\nCyril and Robert went out with the taste of apple still in their mouths\nand the purple of blackberries on their lips--and, in the case of\nRobert, on the wristband as well--and bought a big sheet of cardboard at\nthe stationers. Then at the plumber’s shop, that has tubes and pipes\nand taps and gas-fittings in the window, they bought a pane of glass the\nsame size as the cardboard. The man cut it with a very interesting tool\nthat had a bit of diamond at the end, and he gave them, out of his own\nfree generousness, a large piece of putty and a small piece of glue.\n\nWhile they were out the girls had floated four photographs of the four\nchildren off their cards in hot water. These were now stuck in a row\nalong the top of the cardboard. Cyril put the glue to melt in a jampot,\nand put the jampot in a saucepan and saucepan on the fire, while Robert\npainted a wreath of poppies round the photographs. He painted rather\nwell and very quickly, and poppies are easy to do if you’ve once been\nshown how. Then Anthea drew some printed letters and Jane coloured them.\nThe words were:\n\n   ‘With all our loves to shew\n   We like the thigs to eat.’\n\nAnd when the painting was dry they all signed their names at the bottom\nand put the glass on, and glued brown paper round the edge and over the\nback, and put two loops of tape to hang it up by.\n\nOf course everyone saw when too late that there were not enough letters\nin ‘things’, so the missing ‘n’ was put in. It was impossible, of\ncourse, to do the whole thing over again for just one letter.\n\n‘There!’ said Anthea, placing it carefully, face up, under the sofa.\n‘It’ll be hours before the glue’s dry. Now, Squirrel, fire ahead!’\n\n‘Well, then,’ said Cyril in a great hurry, rubbing at his gluey hands\nwith his pocket handkerchief. ‘What I mean to say is this.’\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n‘Well,’ said Robert at last, ‘WHAT is it that you mean to say?’\n\n‘It’s like this,’ said Cyril, and again stopped short.\n\n‘Like WHAT?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘How can I tell you if you will all keep on interrupting?’ said Cyril\nsharply.\n\nSo no one said any more, and with wrinkled frowns he arranged his ideas.\n\n‘Look here,’ he said, ‘what I really mean is--we can remember now what\nwe did when we went to look for the Amulet. And if we’d found it we\nshould remember that too.’\n\n‘Rather!’ said Robert. ‘Only, you see we haven’t.’\n\n‘But in the future we shall have.’\n\n‘Shall we, though?’ said Jane.\n\n‘Yes--unless we’ve been made fools of by the Psammead. So then, where we\nwant to go to is where we shall remember about where we did find it.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Robert, but he didn’t.\n\n‘_I_ don’t,’ said Anthea, who did, very nearly. ‘Say it again, Squirrel,\nand very slowly.’\n\n‘If,’ said Cyril, very slowly indeed, ‘we go into the future--after\nwe’ve found the Amulet--’\n\n‘But we’ve got to find it first,’ said Jane.\n\n‘Hush!’ said Anthea.\n\n‘There will be a future,’ said Cyril, driven to greater clearness by the\nblank faces of the other three, ‘there will be a time AFTER we’ve found\nit. Let’s go into THAT time--and then we shall remember HOW we found it.\nAnd then we can go back and do the finding really.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Robert, and this time he did, and I hope YOU do.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea. ‘Oh, Squirrel, how clever of you!’\n\n‘But will the Amulet work both ways?’ inquired Robert.\n\n‘It ought to,’ said Cyril, ‘if time’s only a thingummy of whatsitsname.\nAnyway we might try.’\n\n‘Let’s put on our best things, then,’ urged Jane. ‘You know what people\nsay about progress and the world growing better and brighter. I expect\npeople will be awfully smart in the future.’\n\n‘All right,’ said Anthea, ‘we should have to wash anyway, I’m all thick\nwith glue.’\n\nWhen everyone was clean and dressed, the charm was held up.\n\n‘We want to go into the future and see the Amulet after we’ve found it,’\nsaid Cyril, and Jane said the word of Power. They walked through the big\narch of the charm straight into the British Museum.\n\nThey knew it at once, and there, right in front of them, under a glass\ncase, was the Amulet--their own half of it, as well as the other half\nthey had never been able to find--and the two were joined by a pin of\nred stone that formed a hinge.\n\n‘Oh, glorious!’ cried Robert. ‘Here it is!’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Cyril, very gloomily, ‘here it is. But we can’t get it out.’\n\n‘No,’ said Robert, remembering how impossible the Queen of Babylon had\nfound it to get anything out of the glass cases in the Museum--except by\nPsammead magic, and then she hadn’t been able to take anything away with\nher; ‘no--but we remember where we got it, and we can--’\n\n‘Oh, DO we?’ interrupted Cyril bitterly, ‘do YOU remember where we got\nit?’\n\n‘No,’ said Robert, ‘I don’t exactly, now I come to think of it.’\n\nNor did any of the others!\n\n‘But WHY can’t we?’ said Jane.\n\n‘Oh, _I_ don’t know,’ Cyril’s tone was impatient, ‘some silly old\nenchanted rule I suppose. I wish people would teach you magic at school\nlike they do sums--or instead of. It would be some use having an Amulet\nthen.’\n\n‘I wonder how far we are in the future,’ said Anthea; the Museum looks\njust the same, only lighter and brighter, somehow.’\n\n‘Let’s go back and try the Past again,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Perhaps the Museum people could tell us how we got it,’ said Anthea\nwith sudden hope. There was no one in the room, but in the next gallery,\nwhere the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a kind, stout\nman in a loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs.\n\n‘Oh, they’ve got a new uniform, how pretty!’ said Jane.\n\nWhen they asked him their question he showed them a label on the case.\nIt said, ‘From the collection of--.’ A name followed, and it was the\nname of the learned gentleman who, among themselves, and to his face\nwhen he had been with them at the other side of the Amulet, they had\ncalled Jimmy.\n\n‘THAT’S not much good,’ said Cyril, ‘thank you.’\n\n‘How is it you’re not at school?’ asked the kind man in blue. ‘Not\nexpelled for long I hope?’\n\n‘We’re not expelled at all,’ said Cyril rather warmly.\n\n‘Well, I shouldn’t do it again, if I were you,’ said the man, and\nthey could see he did not believe them. There is no company so little\npleasing as that of people who do not believe you.\n\n‘Thank you for showing us the label,’ said Cyril. And they came away.\n\nAs they came through the doors of the Museum they blinked at the sudden\nglory of sunlight and blue sky. The houses opposite the Museum were\ngone. Instead there was a big garden, with trees and flowers and smooth\ngreen lawns, and not a single notice to tell you not to walk on the\ngrass and not to destroy the trees and shrubs and not to pick the\nflowers. There were comfortable seats all about, and arbours covered\nwith roses, and long, trellised walks, also rose-covered. Whispering,\nsplashing fountains fell into full white marble basins, white statues\ngleamed among the leaves, and the pigeons that swept about among the\nbranches or pecked on the smooth, soft gravel were not black and tumbled\nlike the Museum pigeons are now, but bright and clean and sleek as birds\nof new silver. A good many people were sitting on the seats, and on the\ngrass babies were rolling and kicking and playing--with very little on\nindeed. Men, as well as women, seemed to be in charge of the babies and\nwere playing with them.\n\n\n‘It’s like a lovely picture,’ said Anthea, and it was. For the people’s\nclothes were of bright, soft colours and all beautifully and very simply\nmade. No one seemed to have any hats or bonnets, but there were a great\nmany Japanese-looking sunshades. And among the trees were hung lamps of\ncoloured glass.\n\n‘I expect they light those in the evening,’ said Jane. ‘I do wish we\nlived in the future!’\n\nThey walked down the path, and as they went the people on the benches\nlooked at the four children very curiously, but not rudely or unkindly.\nThe children, in their turn, looked--I hope they did not stare--at the\nfaces of these people in the beautiful soft clothes. Those faces were\nworth looking at. Not that they were all handsome, though even in the\nmatter of handsomeness they had the advantage of any set of people the\nchildren had ever seen. But it was the expression of their faces that\nmade them worth looking at. The children could not tell at first what it\nwas.\n\n‘I know,’ said Anthea suddenly. ‘They’re not worried; that’s what it\nis.’\n\nAnd it was. Everybody looked calm, no one seemed to be in a hurry, no\none seemed to be anxious, or fretted, and though some did seem to be\nsad, not a single one looked worried.\n\nBut though the people looked kind everyone looked so interested in the\nchildren that they began to feel a little shy and turned out of the big\nmain path into a narrow little one that wound among trees and shrubs and\nmossy, dripping springs.\n\nIt was here, in a deep, shadowed cleft between tall cypresses, that they\nfound the expelled little boy. He was lying face downward on the mossy\nturf, and the peculiar shaking of his shoulders was a thing they had\nseen, more than once, in each other. So Anthea kneeled down by him and\nsaid--\n\n‘What’s the matter?’\n\n‘I’m expelled from school,’ said the boy between his sobs.\n\nThis was serious. People are not expelled for light offences.\n\n‘Do you mind telling us what you’d done?’\n\n‘I--I tore up a sheet of paper and threw it about in the playground,’\nsaid the child, in the tone of one confessing an unutterable baseness.\n‘You won’t talk to me any more now you know that,’ he added without\nlooking up.\n\n‘Was that all?’ asked Anthea.\n\n‘It’s about enough,’ said the child; ‘and I’m expelled for the whole\nday!’\n\n‘I don’t quite understand,’ said Anthea, gently. The boy lifted his\nface, rolled over, and sat up.\n\n‘Why, whoever on earth are you?’ he said.\n\n‘We’re strangers from a far country,’ said Anthea. ‘In our country it’s\nnot a crime to leave a bit of paper about.’\n\n‘It is here,’ said the child. ‘If grown-ups do it they’re fined. When we\ndo it we’re expelled for the whole day.’\n\n‘Well, but,’ said Robert, ‘that just means a day’s holiday.’\n\n‘You MUST come from a long way off,’ said the little boy. ‘A holiday’s\nwhen you all have play and treats and jolliness, all of you together.\nOn your expelled days no one’ll speak to you. Everyone sees you’re an\nExpelleder or you’d be in school.’\n\n‘Suppose you were ill?’\n\n‘Nobody is--hardly. If they are, of course they wear the badge, and\neveryone is kind to you. I know a boy that stole his sister’s illness\nbadge and wore it when he was expelled for a day. HE got expelled for a\nweek for that. It must be awful not to go to school for a week.’\n\n‘Do you LIKE school, then?’ asked Robert incredulously.\n\n‘Of course I do. It’s the loveliest place there is. I chose railways for\nmy special subject this year, there are such splendid models and things,\nand now I shall be all behind because of that torn-up paper.’\n\n‘You choose your own subject?’ asked Cyril.\n\n‘Yes, of course. Where DID you come from? Don’t you know ANYTHING?’\n\n‘No,’ said Jane definitely; ‘so you’d better tell us.’\n\n‘Well, on Midsummer Day school breaks up and everything’s decorated with\nflowers, and you choose your special subject for next year. Of course\nyou have to stick to it for a year at least. Then there are all your\nother subjects, of course, reading, and painting, and the rules of\nCitizenship.’\n\n‘Good gracious!’ said Anthea.\n\n‘Look here,’ said the child, jumping up, ‘it’s nearly four. The\nexpelledness only lasts till then. Come home with me. Mother will tell\nyou all about everything.’\n\n‘Will your mother like you taking home strange children?’ asked Anthea.\n\n‘I don’t understand,’ said the child, settling his leather belt over his\nhoney-coloured smock and stepping out with hard little bare feet. ‘Come\non.’\n\nSo they went.\n\nThe streets were wide and hard and very clean. There were no horses, but\na sort of motor carriage that made no noise. The Thames flowed between\ngreen banks, and there were trees at the edge, and people sat under\nthem, fishing, for the stream was clear as crystal. Everywhere there\nwere green trees and there was no smoke. The houses were set in what\nseemed like one green garden.\n\nThe little boy brought them to a house, and at the window was a good,\nbright mother-face. The little boy rushed in, and through the window\nthey could see him hugging his mother, then his eager lips moving and\nhis quick hands pointing.\n\nA lady in soft green clothes came out, spoke kindly to them, and took\nthem into the oddest house they had ever seen. It was very bare, there\nwere no ornaments, and yet every single thing was beautiful, from\nthe dresser with its rows of bright china, to the thick squares of\nEastern-looking carpet on the floors. I can’t describe that house; I\nhaven’t the time. And I haven’t heart either, when I think how different\nit was from our houses. The lady took them all over it. The oddest thing\nof all was the big room in the middle. It had padded walls and a soft,\nthick carpet, and all the chairs and tables were padded. There wasn’t a\nsingle thing in it that anyone could hurt itself with.\n\n‘What ever’s this for?--lunatics?’ asked Cyril.\n\nThe lady looked very shocked.\n\n‘No! It’s for the children, of course,’ she said. ‘Don’t tell me that in\nyour country there are no children’s rooms.’\n\n‘There are nurseries,’ said Anthea doubtfully, ‘but the furniture’s all\ncornery and hard, like other rooms.’\n\n‘How shocking!’ said the lady; ‘you must be VERY much behind the times in\nyour country! Why, the children are more than half of the people; it’s\nnot much to have one room where they can have a good time and not hurt\nthemselves.’\n\n‘But there’s no fireplace,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘Hot-air pipes, of course,’ said the lady. ‘Why, how could you have a\nfire in a nursery? A child might get burned.’\n\n‘In our country,’ said Robert suddenly, ‘more than 3,000 children are\nburned to death every year. Father told me,’ he added, as if apologizing\nfor this piece of information, ‘once when I’d been playing with fire.’\n\nThe lady turned quite pale.\n\n‘What a frightful place you must live in!’ she said. ‘What’s all the\nfurniture padded for?’ Anthea asked, hastily turning the subject.\n\n‘Why, you couldn’t have little tots of two or three running about in\nrooms where the things were hard and sharp! They might hurt themselves.’\n\nRobert fingered the scar on his forehead where he had hit it against the\nnursery fender when he was little.\n\n‘But does everyone have rooms like this, poor people and all?’ asked\nAnthea.\n\n‘There’s a room like this wherever there’s a child, of course,’ said the\nlady. ‘How refreshingly ignorant you are!--no, I don’t mean ignorant,\nmy dear. Of course, you’re awfully well up in ancient History. But I see\nyou haven’t done your Duties of Citizenship Course yet.’\n\n‘But beggars, and people like that?’ persisted Anthea ‘and tramps and\npeople who haven’t any homes?’\n\n‘People who haven’t any homes?’ repeated the lady. ‘I really DON’T\nunderstand what you’re talking about.’\n\n‘It’s all different in our country,’ said Cyril carefully; and I have\nread it used to be different in London. Usedn’t people to have no homes\nand beg because they were hungry? And wasn’t London very black and\ndirty once upon a time? And the Thames all muddy and filthy? And narrow\nstreets, and--’\n\n‘You must have been reading very old-fashioned books,’ said the lady.\n‘Why, all that was in the dark ages! My husband can tell you more about\nit than I can. He took Ancient History as one of his special subjects.’\n\n‘I haven’t seen any working people,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘Why, we’re all working people,’ said the lady; ‘at least my husband’s a\ncarpenter.’\n\n‘Good gracious!’ said Anthea; ‘but you’re a lady!’\n\n‘Ah,’ said the lady, ‘that quaint old word! Well, my husband WILL enjoy\na talk with you. In the dark ages everyone was allowed to have a smoky\nchimney, and those nasty horses all over the streets, and all sorts of\nrubbish thrown into the Thames. And, of course, the sufferings of the\npeople will hardly bear thinking of. It’s very learned of you to know it\nall. Did you make Ancient History your special subject?’\n\n‘Not exactly,’ said Cyril, rather uneasily. ‘What is the Duties of\nCitizenship Course about?’\n\n‘Don’t you REALLY know? Aren’t you pretending--just for fun? Really not?\nWell, that course teaches you how to be a good citizen, what you must\ndo and what you mayn’t do, so as to do your full share of the work of\nmaking your town a beautiful and happy place for people to live in.\nThere’s a quite simple little thing they teach the tiny children. How\ndoes it go...?\n\n   ‘I must not steal and I must learn,\n   Nothing is mine that I do not earn.\n   I must try in work and play\n   To make things beautiful every day.\n   I must be kind to everyone,\n   And never let cruel things be done.\n   I must be brave, and I must try\n   When I am hurt never to cry,\n   And always laugh as much as I can,\n   And be glad that I’m going to be a man\n   To work for my living and help the rest\n   And never do less than my very best.’\n\n‘That’s very easy,’ said Jane. ‘_I_ could remember that.’\n\n‘That’s only the very beginning, of course,’ said the lady; ‘there are\nheaps more rhymes. There’s the one beginning--\n\n   ‘I must not litter the beautiful street\n   With bits of paper or things to eat;\n   I must not pick the public flowers,\n   They are not MINE, but they are OURS.’\n\n‘And “things to eat” reminds me--are you hungry? Wells, run and get a\ntray of nice things.’\n\n‘Why do you call him “Wells”?’ asked Robert, as the boy ran off.\n\n‘It’s after the great reformer--surely you’ve heard of HIM? He lived in\nthe dark ages, and he saw that what you ought to do is to find out what\nyou want and then try to get it. Up to then people had always tried\nto tinker up what they’d got. We’ve got a great many of the things he\nthought of. Then “Wells” means springs of clear water. It’s a nice name,\ndon’t you think?’\n\nHere Wells returned with strawberries and cakes and lemonade on a tray,\nand everybody ate and enjoyed.\n\n‘Now, Wells,’ said the lady, ‘run off or you’ll be late and not meet\nyour Daddy.’\n\nWells kissed her, waved to the others, and went.\n\n‘Look here,’ said Anthea suddenly, ‘would you like to come to OUR\ncountry, and see what it’s like? It wouldn’t take you a minute.’\n\nThe lady laughed. But Jane held up the charm and said the word.\n\n‘What a splendid conjuring trick!’ cried the lady, enchanted with the\nbeautiful, growing arch.\n\n‘Go through,’ said Anthea.\n\nThe lady went, laughing. But she did not laugh when she found herself,\nsuddenly, in the dining-room at Fitzroy Street.\n\n‘Oh, what a HORRIBLE trick!’ she cried. ‘What a hateful, dark, ugly\nplace!’\n\nShe ran to the window and looked out. The sky was grey, the street was\nfoggy, a dismal organ-grinder was standing opposite the door, a beggar\nand a man who sold matches were quarrelling at the edge of the pavement\non whose greasy black surface people hurried along, hastening to get to\nthe shelter of their houses.\n\n‘Oh, look at their faces, their horrible faces!’ she cried. ‘What’s the\nmatter with them all?’\n\n‘They’re poor people, that’s all,’ said Robert.\n\n‘But it’s NOT all! They’re ill, they’re unhappy, they’re wicked! Oh,\ndo stop it, there’s dear children. It’s very, very clever. Some sort of\nmagic-lantern trick, I suppose, like I’ve read of. But DO stop it. Oh!\ntheir poor, tired, miserable, wicked faces!’\n\nThe tears were in her eyes. Anthea signed to Jane. The arch grew, they\nspoke the words, and pushed the lady through it into her own time and\nplace, where London is clean and beautiful, and the Thames runs clear\nand bright, and the green trees grow, and no one is afraid, or anxious,\nor in a hurry. There was a silence. Then--\n\n‘I’m glad we went,’ said Anthea, with a deep breath.\n\n‘I’ll never throw paper about again as long as I live,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Mother always told us not to,’ said Jane.\n\n‘I would like to take up the Duties of Citizenship for a special\nsubject,’ said Cyril. ‘I wonder if Father could put me through it. I\nshall ask him when he comes home.’\n\n‘If we’d found the Amulet, Father could be home NOW,’ said Anthea, ‘and\nMother and The Lamb.’\n\n‘Let’s go into the future AGAIN,’ suggested Jane brightly. ‘Perhaps we\ncould remember if it wasn’t such an awful way off.’\n\nSo they did. This time they said, ‘The future, where the Amulet is, not\nso far away.’\n\nAnd they went through the familiar arch into a large, light room with\nthree windows. Facing them was the familiar mummy-case. And at a table\nby the window sat the learned gentleman. They knew him at once, though\nhis hair was white. He was one of the faces that do not change with age.\nIn his hand was the Amulet--complete and perfect.\n\nHe rubbed his other hand across his forehead in the way they were so\nused to.\n\n‘Dreams, dreams!’ he said; ‘old age is full of them!’\n\n‘You’ve been in dreams with us before now,’ said Robert, ‘don’t you\nremember?’\n\n‘I do, indeed,’ said he. The room had many more books than the Fitzroy\nStreet room, and far more curious and wonderful Assyrian and Egyptian\nobjects. ‘The most wonderful dreams I ever had had you in them.’\n\n‘Where,’ asked Cyril, ‘did you get that thing in your hand?’\n\n‘If you weren’t just a dream,’ he answered, smiling, you’d remember that\nyou gave it to me.’\n\n‘But where did we get it?’ Cyril asked eagerly.\n\n‘Ah, you never would tell me that,’ he said, ‘You always had your little\nmysteries. You dear children! What a difference you made to that old\nBloomsbury house! I wish I could dream you oftener. Now you’re grown up\nyou’re not like you used to be.’\n\n‘Grown up?’ said Anthea.\n\nThe learned gentleman pointed to a frame with four photographs in it.\n\n‘There you are,’ he said.\n\nThe children saw four grown-up people’s portraits--two ladies, two\ngentlemen--and looked on them with loathing.\n\n‘Shall we grow up like THAT?’ whispered Jane. ‘How perfectly horrid!’\n\n‘If we’re ever like that, we sha’n’t know it’s horrid, I expect,’ Anthea\nwith some insight whispered back. ‘You see, you get used to yourself\nwhile you’re changing. It’s--it’s being so sudden makes it seem so\nfrightful now.’\n\nThe learned gentleman was looking at them with wistful kindness. ‘Don’t\nlet me undream you just yet,’ he said. There was a pause.\n\n‘Do you remember WHEN we gave you that Amulet?’ Cyril asked suddenly.\n\n‘You know, or you would if you weren’t a dream, that it was on the 3rd\nDecember, 1905. I shall never forget THAT day.’\n\n‘Thank you,’ said Cyril, earnestly; ‘oh, thank you very much.’\n\n‘You’ve got a new room,’ said Anthea, looking out of the window, ‘and\nwhat a lovely garden!’\n\n‘Yes,’ said he, ‘I’m too old now to care even about being near the\nMuseum. This is a beautiful place. Do you know--I can hardly believe\nyou’re just a dream, you do look so exactly real. Do you know...’ his\nvoice dropped, ‘I can say it to YOU, though, of course, if I said it to\nanyone that wasn’t a dream they’d call me mad; there was something about\nthat Amulet you gave me--something very mysterious.’\n\n‘There was that,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Ah, I don’t mean your pretty little childish mysteries about where you\ngot it. But about the thing itself. First, the wonderful dreams I used\nto have, after you’d shown me the first half of it! Why, my book on\nAtlantis, that I did, was the beginning of my fame and my fortune, too.\nAnd I got it all out of a dream! And then, “Britain at the Time of the\nRoman Invasion”--that was only a pamphlet, but it explained a lot of\nthings people hadn’t understood.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea, ‘it would.’\n\n‘That was the beginning. But after you’d given me the whole of the\nAmulet--ah, it was generous of you!--then, somehow, I didn’t need to\ntheorize, I seemed to KNOW about the old Egyptian civilization. And\nthey can’t upset my theories’--he rubbed his thin hands and laughed\ntriumphantly--‘they can’t, though they’ve tried. Theories, they call\nthem, but they’re more like--I don’t know--more like memories. I KNOW\nI’m right about the secret rites of the Temple of Amen.’\n\n‘I’m so glad you’re rich,’ said Anthea. ‘You weren’t, you know, at\nFitzroy Street.’\n\n‘Indeed I wasn’t,’ said he, ‘but I am now. This beautiful house and this\nlovely garden--I dig in it sometimes; you remember, you used to tell\nme to take more exercise? Well, I feel I owe it all to you--and the\nAmulet.’\n\n‘I’m so glad,’ said Anthea, and kissed him. He started.\n\n‘THAT didn’t feel like a dream,’ he said, and his voice trembled.\n\n‘It isn’t exactly a dream,’ said Anthea softly, ‘it’s all part of the\nAmulet--it’s a sort of extra special, real dream, dear Jimmy.’\n\n‘Ah,’ said he, ‘when you call me that, I know I’m dreaming. My little\nsister--I dream of her sometimes. But it’s not real like this. Do you\nremember the day I dreamed you brought me the Babylonish ring?’\n\n‘We remember it all,’ said Robert. ‘Did you leave Fitzroy Street because\nyou were too rich for it?’\n\n‘Oh, no!’ he said reproachfully. ‘You know I should never have done such\na thing as that. Of course, I left when your old Nurse died and--what’s\nthe matter!’\n\n‘Old Nurse DEAD?’ said Anthea. ‘Oh, NO!’\n\n‘Yes, yes, it’s the common lot. It’s a long time ago now.’\n\nJane held up the Amulet in a hand that twittered.\n\n‘Come!’ she cried, ‘oh, come home! She may be dead before we get there,\nand then we can’t give it to her. Oh, come!’\n\n‘Ah, don’t let the dream end now!’ pleaded the learned gentleman.\n\n‘It must,’ said Anthea firmly, and kissed him again.\n\n‘When it comes to people dying,’ said Robert, ‘good-bye! I’m so glad\nyou’re rich and famous and happy.’\n\n‘DO come!’ cried Jane, stamping in her agony of impatience. And they\nwent. Old Nurse brought in tea almost as soon as they were back in\nFitzroy Street. As she came in with the tray, the girls rushed at her\nand nearly upset her and it.\n\n‘Don’t die!’ cried Jane, ‘oh, don’t!’ and Anthea cried, ‘Dear, ducky,\ndarling old Nurse, don’t die!’\n\n‘Lord, love you!’ said Nurse, ‘I’m not agoin’ to die yet a while, please\nHeaven! Whatever on earth’s the matter with the chicks?’\n\n‘Nothing. Only don’t!’\n\nShe put the tray down and hugged the girls in turn. The boys thumped her\non the back with heartfelt affection.\n\n‘I’m as well as ever I was in my life,’ she said. ‘What nonsense about\ndying! You’ve been a sitting too long in the dusk, that’s what it is.\nRegular blind man’s holiday. Leave go of me, while I light the gas.’\n\nThe yellow light illuminated four pale faces. ‘We do love you so,’\nAnthea went on, ‘and we’ve made you a picture to show you how we love\nyou. Get it out, Squirrel.’\n\nThe glazed testimonial was dragged out from under the sofa and\ndisplayed.\n\n‘The glue’s not dry yet,’ said Cyril, ‘look out!’\n\n‘What a beauty!’ cried old Nurse. ‘Well, I never! And your pictures and\nthe beautiful writing and all. Well, I always did say your hearts was in\nthe right place, if a bit careless at times. Well! I never did! I don’t\nknow as I was ever pleased better in my life.’\n\nShe hugged them all, one after the other. And the boys did not mind it,\nsomehow, that day.\n\n\n‘How is it we can remember all about the future, NOW?’ Anthea woke the\nPsammead with laborious gentleness to put the question. ‘How is it we\ncan remember what we saw in the future, and yet, when we WERE in the\nfuture, we could not remember the bit of the future that was past then,\nthe time of finding the Amulet?’\n\n‘Why, what a silly question!’ said the Psammead, ‘of course you cannot\nremember what hasn’t happened yet.’\n\n‘But the FUTURE hasn’t happened yet,’ Anthea persisted, ‘and we remember\nthat all right.’\n\n‘Oh, that isn’t what’s happened, my good child,’ said the Psammead,\nrather crossly, ‘that’s prophetic vision. And you remember dreams, don’t\nyou? So why not visions? You never do seem to understand the simplest\nthing.’\n\nIt went to sand again at once.\n\nAnthea crept down in her nightgown to give one last kiss to old Nurse,\nand one last look at the beautiful testimonial hanging, by its tapes,\nits glue now firmly set, in glazed glory on the wall of the kitchen.\n\n‘Good-night, bless your loving heart,’ said old Nurse, ‘if only you\ndon’t catch your deather-cold!’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. THE SHIPWRECK ON THE TIN ISLANDS\n\n‘Blue and red,’ said Jane softly, ‘make purple.’\n\n‘Not always they don’t,’ said Cyril, ‘it has to be crimson lake\nand Prussian blue. If you mix Vermilion and Indigo you get the most\nloathsome slate colour.’\n\n‘Sepia’s the nastiest colour in the box, I think,’ said Jane, sucking\nher brush.\n\nThey were all painting. Nurse in the flush of grateful emotion, excited\nby Robert’s border of poppies, had presented each of the four with a\nshilling paint-box, and had supplemented the gift with a pile of old\ncopies of the Illustrated London News.\n\n‘Sepia,’ said Cyril instructively, ‘is made out of beastly cuttlefish.’\n\n‘Purple’s made out of a fish, as well as out of red and blue,’ said\nRobert. ‘Tyrian purple was, I know.’\n\n‘Out of lobsters?’ said Jane dreamily. ‘They’re red when they’re boiled,\nand blue when they aren’t. If you mixed live and dead lobsters you’d get\nTyrian purple.’\n\n‘_I_ shouldn’t like to mix anything with a live lobster,’ said Anthea,\nshuddering.\n\n‘Well, there aren’t any other red and blue fish,’ said Jane; ‘you’d have\nto.’\n\n‘I’d rather not have the purple,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘The Tyrian purple wasn’t that colour when it came out of the fish, nor\nyet afterwards, it wasn’t,’ said Robert; ‘it was scarlet really, and\nRoman Emperors wore it. And it wasn’t any nice colour while the fish had\nit. It was a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency.’\n\n‘How do you know?’ asked Cyril.\n\n‘I read it,’ said Robert, with the meek pride of superior knowledge.\n\n‘Where?’ asked Cyril.\n\n‘In print,’ said Robert, still more proudly meek.\n\n‘You think everything’s true if it’s printed,’ said Cyril, naturally\nannoyed, ‘but it isn’t. Father said so. Quite a lot of lies get printed,\nespecially in newspapers.’\n\n‘You see, as it happens,’ said Robert, in what was really a rather\nannoying tone, ‘it wasn’t a newspaper, it was in a book.’\n\n‘How sweet Chinese white is!’ said Jane, dreamily sucking her brush\nagain.\n\n‘I don’t believe it,’ said Cyril to Robert.\n\n‘Have a suck yourself,’ suggested Robert.\n\n‘I don’t mean about the Chinese white. I mean about the cream fish\nturning purple and--’\n\n‘Oh!’ cried Anthea, jumping up very quickly, ‘I’m tired of painting.\nLet’s go somewhere by Amulet. I say let’s let IT choose.’\n\nCyril and Robert agreed that this was an idea. Jane consented to stop\npainting because, as she said, Chinese white, though certainly sweet,\ngives you a queer feeling in the back of the throat if you paint with it\ntoo long.\n\nThe Amulet was held up. ‘Take us somewhere,’ said Jane, ‘anywhere you\nlike in the Past--but somewhere where you are.’ Then she said the word.\n\nNext moment everyone felt a queer rocking and swaying--something like\nwhat you feel when you go out in a fishing boat. And that was not\nwonderful, when you come to think of it, for it was in a boat that they\nfound themselves. A queer boat, with high bulwarks pierced with holes\nfor oars to go through. There was a high seat for the steersman, and\nthe prow was shaped like the head of some great animal with big, staring\neyes. The boat rode at anchor in a bay, and the bay was very smooth.\nThe crew were dark, wiry fellows with black beards and hair. They had no\nclothes except a tunic from waist to knee, and round caps with knobs\non the top. They were very busy, and what they were doing was so\ninteresting to the children that at first they did not even wonder where\nthe Amulet had brought them. And the crew seemed too busy to notice the\nchildren. They were fastening rush baskets to a long rope with a great\npiece of cork at the end, and in each basket they put mussels or little\nfrogs. Then they cast out the rope, the baskets sank, but the cork\nfloated. And all about on the blue water were other boats and all the\ncrews of all the boats were busy with ropes and baskets and frogs and\nmussels.\n\n‘Whatever are you doing?’ Jane suddenly asked a man who had rather more\nclothes than the others, and seemed to be a sort of captain or overseer.\nHe started and stared at her, but he had seen too many strange lands to\nbe very much surprised at these queerly-dressed stowaways.\n\n‘Setting lines for the dye shell-fish,’ he said shortly. ‘How did you\nget here?’\n\n‘A sort of magic,’ said Robert carelessly. The Captain fingered an\nAmulet that hung round his neck.\n\n‘What is this place?’ asked Cyril.\n\n‘Tyre, of course,’ said the man. Then he drew back and spoke in a low\nvoice to one of the sailors.\n\n‘Now we shall know about your precious cream-jug fish,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘But we never SAID come to Tyre,’ said Jane.\n\n‘The Amulet heard us talking, I expect. I think it’s MOST obliging of\nit,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘And the Amulet’s here too,’ said Robert. ‘We ought to be able to find\nit in a little ship like this. I wonder which of them’s got it.’\n\n‘Oh--look, look!’ cried Anthea suddenly. On the bare breast of one of\nthe sailors gleamed something red. It was the exact counterpart of their\nprecious half-Amulet.\n\nA silence, full of emotion, was broken by Jane.\n\n‘Then we’ve found it!’ she said. ‘Oh do let’s take it and go home!’\n\n‘Easy to say “take it”,’ said Cyril; ‘he looks very strong.’\n\nHe did--yet not so strong as the other sailors.\n\n‘It’s odd,’ said Anthea musingly, ‘I do believe I’ve seen that man\nsomewhere before.’\n\n‘He’s rather like our learned gentleman,’ said Robert, ‘but I’ll tell\nyou who he’s much more like--’ At that moment that sailor looked up. His\neyes met Robert’s--and Robert and the others had no longer any doubt as\nto where they had seen him before. It was Rekh-mara, the priest who\nhad led them to the palace of Pharaoh--and whom Jane had looked back at\nthrough the arch, when he was counselling Pharaoh’s guard to take the\njewels and fly for his life.\n\nNobody was quite pleased, and nobody quite knew why.\n\nJane voiced the feelings of all when she said, fingering THEIR Amulet\nthrough the folds of her frock, ‘We can go back in a minute if anything\nnasty happens.’\n\nFor the moment nothing worse happened than an offer of food--figs and\ncucumbers it was, and very pleasant.\n\n‘I see,’ said the Captain, ‘that you are from a far country. Since\nyou have honoured my boat by appearing on it, you must stay here\ntill morning. Then I will lead you to one of our great ones. He loves\nstrangers from far lands.’\n\n‘Let’s go home,’ Jane whispered, ‘all the frogs are drowning NOW. I\nthink the people here are cruel.’\n\nBut the boys wanted to stay and see the lines taken up in the morning.\n\n‘It’s just like eel-pots and lobster-pots,’ said Cyril, ‘the baskets\nonly open from outside--I vote we stay.’\n\nSo they stayed.\n\n‘That’s Tyre over there,’ said the Captain, who was evidently trying to\nbe civil. He pointed to a great island rock, that rose steeply from the\nsea, crowned with huge walls and towers. There was another city on the\nmainland.\n\n‘That’s part of Tyre, too,’ said the Captain; ‘it’s where the great\nmerchants have their pleasure-houses and gardens and farms.’\n\n‘Look, look!’ Cyril cried suddenly; ‘what a lovely little ship!’\n\nA ship in full sail was passing swiftly through the fishing fleet. The\nCaptain’s face changed. He frowned, and his eyes blazed with fury.\n\n‘Insolent young barbarian!’ he cried. ‘Do you call the ships of Tyre\nLITTLE? None greater sail the seas. That ship has been on a three years’\nvoyage. She is known in all the great trading ports from here to the\nTin Islands. She comes back rich and glorious. Her very anchor is of\nsilver.’\n\n‘I’m sure we beg your pardon,’ said Anthea hastily. ‘In our country we\nsay “little” for a pet name. Your wife might call you her dear little\nhusband, you know.’\n\n‘I should like to catch her at it,’ growled the Captain, but he stopped\nscowling.\n\n‘It’s a rich trade,’ he went on. ‘For cloth ONCE dipped, second-best\nglass, and the rough images our young artists carve for practice, the\nbarbarian King in Tessos lets us work the silver mines. We get so much\nsilver there that we leave them our iron anchors and come back with\nsilver ones.’\n\n‘How splendid!’ said Robert. ‘Do go on. What’s cloth once dipped?’\n\n‘You MUST be barbarians from the outer darkness,’ said the Captain\nscornfully. ‘All wealthy nations know that our finest stuffs are twice\ndyed--dibaptha. They’re only for the robes of kings and priests and\nprinces.’\n\n‘What do the rich merchants wear,’ asked Jane, with interest, ‘in the\npleasure-houses?’\n\n‘They wear the dibaptha. OUR merchants ARE princes,’ scowled the\nskipper.\n\n‘Oh, don’t be cross, we do so like hearing about things. We want to know\nALL about the dyeing,’ said Anthea cordially.\n\n‘Oh, you do, do you?’ growled the man. ‘So that’s what you’re here for?\nWell, you won’t get the secrets of the dye trade out of ME.’\n\nHe went away, and everyone felt snubbed and uncomfortable. And all the\ntime the long, narrow eyes of the Egyptian were watching, watching. They\nfelt as though he was watching them through the darkness, when they lay\ndown to sleep on a pile of cloaks.\n\nNext morning the baskets were drawn up full of what looked like whelk\nshells.\n\nThe children were rather in the way, but they made themselves as small\nas they could. While the skipper was at the other end of the boat they\ndid ask one question of a sailor, whose face was a little less unkind\nthan the others.\n\n‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘this is the dye-fish. It’s a sort of murex--and\nthere’s another kind that they catch at Sidon and then, of course,\nthere’s the kind that’s used for the dibaptha. But that’s quite\ndifferent. It’s--’\n\n‘Hold your tongue!’ shouted the skipper. And the man held it.\n\nThe laden boat was rowed slowly round the end of the island, and was\nmade fast in one of the two great harbours that lay inside a long\nbreakwater. The harbour was full of all sorts of ships, so that\nCyril and Robert enjoyed themselves much more than their sisters. The\nbreakwater and the quays were heaped with bales and baskets, and crowded\nwith slaves and sailors. Farther along some men were practising diving.\n\n‘That’s jolly good,’ said Robert, as a naked brown body cleft the water.\n\n‘I should think so,’ said the skipper. ‘The pearl-divers of Persia are\nnot more skilful. Why, we’ve got a fresh-water spring that comes out at\nthe bottom of the sea. Our divers dive down and bring up the fresh water\nin skin bottles! Can your barbarian divers do as much?’\n\n‘I suppose not,’ said Robert, and put away a wild desire to explain\nto the Captain the English system of waterworks, pipes, taps, and the\nintricacies of the plumbers’ trade.\n\nAs they neared the quay the skipper made a hasty toilet. He did his\nhair, combed his beard, put on a garment like a jersey with short\nsleeves, an embroidered belt, a necklace of beads, and a big signet\nring.\n\n‘Now,’ said he, ‘I’m fit to be seen. Come along?’\n\n‘Where to?’ said Jane cautiously.\n\n‘To Pheles, the great sea-captain, said the skipper, ‘the man I told you\nof, who loves barbarians.’\n\nThen Rekh-mara came forward, and, for the first time, spoke.\n\n‘I have known these children in another land,’ he said. ‘You know my\npowers of magic. It was my magic that brought these barbarians to your\nboat. And you know how they will profit you. I read your thoughts. Let\nme come with you and see the end of them, and then I will work the spell\nI promised you in return for the little experience you have so kindly\ngiven me on your boat.’\n\nThe skipper looked at the Egyptian with some disfavour.\n\n‘So it was YOUR doing,’ he said. ‘I might have guessed it. Well, come\non.’\n\nSo he came, and the girls wished he hadn’t. But Robert whispered--\n\n‘Nonsense--as long as he’s with us we’ve got some chance of the Amulet.\nWe can always fly if anything goes wrong.’\n\nThe morning was so fresh and bright; their breakfast had been so good\nand so unusual; they had actually seen the Amulet round the Egyptian’s\nneck. One or two, or all these things, suddenly raised the children’s\nspirits. They went off quite cheerfully through the city gate--it was\nnot arched, but roofed over with a great flat stone--and so through the\nstreet, which smelt horribly of fish and garlic and a thousand other\nthings even less agreeable. But far worse than the street scents was the\nscent of the factory, where the skipper called in to sell his night’s\ncatch. I wish I could tell you all about that factory, but I haven’t\ntime, and perhaps after all you aren’t interested in dyeing works. I\nwill only mention that Robert was triumphantly proved to be right. The\ndye WAS a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency, and it smelt\nmore strongly of garlic than garlic itself does.\n\nWhile the skipper was bargaining with the master of the dye works the\nEgyptian came close to the children, and said, suddenly and softly--\n\n‘Trust me.’\n\n‘I wish we could,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘You feel,’ said the Egyptian, ‘that I want your Amulet. That makes you\ndistrust me.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Cyril bluntly.\n\n‘But you also, you want my Amulet, and I am trusting you.’\n\n‘There’s something in that,’ said Robert.\n\n‘We have the two halves of the Amulet,’ said the Priest, ‘but not yet\nthe pin that joined them. Our only chance of getting that is to remain\ntogether. Once part these two halves and they may never be found in the\nsame time and place. Be wise. Our interests are the same.’\n\nBefore anyone could say more the skipper came back, and with him the\ndye-master. His hair and beard were curled like the men’s in Babylon,\nand he was dressed like the skipper, but with added grandeur of gold\nand embroidery. He had necklaces of beads and silver, and a glass amulet\nwith a man’s face, very like his own, set between two bull’s heads, as\nwell as gold and silver bracelets and armlets. He looked keenly at the\nchildren. Then he said--\n\n‘My brother Pheles has just come back from Tarshish. He’s at his garden\nhouse--unless he’s hunting wild boar in the marshes. He gets frightfully\nbored on shore.’\n\n‘Ah,’ said the skipper, ‘he’s a true-born Phoenician. “Tyre, Tyre for\never! Oh, Tyre rules the waves!” as the old song says. I’ll go at once,\nand show him my young barbarians.’\n\n‘I should,’ said the dye-master. ‘They are very rum, aren’t they? What\nfrightful clothes, and what a lot of them! Observe the covering of their\nfeet. Hideous indeed.’\n\nRobert could not help thinking how easy, and at the same time pleasant,\nit would be to catch hold of the dye-master’s feet and tip him backward\ninto the great sunken vat just near him. But if he had, flight would\nhave had to be the next move, so he restrained his impulse.\n\nThere was something about this Tyrian adventure that was different from\nall the others. It was, somehow, calmer. And there was the undoubted\nfact that the charm was there on the neck of the Egyptian.\n\nSo they enjoyed everything to the full, the row from the Island City to\nthe shore, the ride on the donkeys that the skipper hired at the gate of\nthe mainland city, and the pleasant country--palms and figs and cedars\nall about. It was like a garden--clematis, honeysuckle, and jasmine\nclung about the olive and mulberry trees, and there were tulips and\ngladiolus, and clumps of mandrake, which has bell-flowers that look as\nthough they were cut out of dark blue jewels. In the distance were the\nmountains of Lebanon. The house they came to at last was rather like\na bungalow--long and low, with pillars all along the front. Cedars and\nsycamores grew near it and sheltered it pleasantly.\n\nEveryone dismounted, and the donkeys were led away.\n\n‘Why is this like Rosherville?’ whispered Robert, and instantly supplied\nthe answer.\n\n‘Because it’s the place to spend a happy day.’\n\n‘It’s jolly decent of the skipper to have brought us to such a ripping\nplace,’ said Cyril.\n\n‘Do you know,’ said Anthea, ‘this feels more real than anything else\nwe’ve seen? It’s like a holiday in the country at home.’\n\nThe children were left alone in a large hall. The floor was mosaic, done\nwith wonderful pictures of ships and sea-beasts and fishes. Through an\nopen doorway they could see a pleasant courtyard with flowers.\n\n‘I should like to spend a week here,’ said Jane, ‘and donkey ride every\nday.’\n\nEveryone was feeling very jolly. Even the Egyptian looked pleasanter\nthan usual. And then, quite suddenly, the skipper came back with a\njoyous smile. With him came the master of the house. He looked steadily\nat the children and nodded twice.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said, ‘my steward will pay you the price. But I shall not pay\nat that high rate for the Egyptian dog.’\n\nThe two passed on.\n\n‘This,’ said the Egyptian, ‘is a pretty kettle of fish.’\n\n‘What is?’ asked all the children at once.\n\n‘Our present position,’ said Rekh-mara. ‘Our seafaring friend,’ he\nadded, ‘has sold us all for slaves!’\n\n\nA hasty council succeeded the shock of this announcement. The Priest was\nallowed to take part in it. His advice was ‘stay’, because they were in\nno danger, and the Amulet in its completeness must be somewhere near,\nor, of course, they could not have come to that place at all. And after\nsome discussion they agreed to this.\n\nThe children were treated more as guests than as slaves, but the\nEgyptian was sent to the kitchen and made to work.\n\nPheles, the master of the house, went off that very evening, by the\nKing’s orders, to start on another voyage. And when he was gone his wife\nfound the children amusing company, and kept them talking and singing\nand dancing till quite late. ‘To distract my mind from my sorrows,’ she\nsaid.\n\n‘I do like being a slave,’ remarked Jane cheerfully, as they curled up\non the big, soft cushions that were to be their beds.\n\nIt was black night when they were awakened, each by a hand passed softly\nover its face, and a low voice that whispered--\n\n‘Be quiet, or all is lost.’\n\nSo they were quiet.\n\n‘It’s me, Rekh-mara, the Priest of Amen,’ said the whisperer. ‘The man\nwho brought us has gone to sea again, and he has taken my Amulet from me\nby force, and I know no magic to get it back. Is there magic for that in\nthe Amulet you bear?’\n\nEveryone was instantly awake by now.\n\n‘We can go after him,’ said Cyril, leaping up; ‘but he might take OURS\nas well; or he might be angry with us for following him.’\n\n‘I’ll see to THAT,’ said the Egyptian in the dark. ‘Hide your Amulet\nwell.’\n\nThere in the deep blackness of that room in the Tyrian country house the\nAmulet was once more held up and the word spoken.\n\nAll passed through on to a ship that tossed and tumbled on a wind-blown\nsea. They crouched together there till morning, and Jane and Cyril were\nnot at all well. When the dawn showed, dove-coloured, across the steely\nwaves, they stood up as well as they could for the tumbling of the ship.\nPheles, that hardy sailor and adventurer, turned quite pale when he\nturned round suddenly and saw them.\n\n‘Well!’ he said, ‘well, I never did!’\n\n‘Master,’ said the Egyptian, bowing low, and that was even more\ndifficult than standing up, ‘we are here by the magic of the sacred\nAmulet that hangs round your neck.’\n\n‘I never did!’ repeated Pheles. ‘Well, well!’\n\n‘What port is the ship bound for?’ asked Robert, with a nautical air.\n\nBut Pheles said, ‘Are you a navigator?’ Robert had to own that he was\nnot.\n\n‘Then,’ said Pheles, ‘I don’t mind telling you that we’re bound for the\nTin Isles. Tyre alone knows where the Tin Isles are. It is a splendid\nsecret we keep from all the world. It is as great a thing to us as your\nmagic to you.’\n\nHe spoke in quite a new voice, and seemed to respect both the children\nand the Amulet a good deal more than he had done before.\n\n‘The King sent you, didn’t he?’ said Jane.\n\n‘Yes,’ answered Pheles, ‘he bade me set sail with half a score brave\ngentlemen and this crew. You shall go with us, and see many wonders.’ He\nbowed and left them.\n\n‘What are we going to do now?’ said Robert, when Pheles had caused them\nto be left along with a breakfast of dried fruits and a sort of hard\nbiscuit.\n\n‘Wait till he lands in the Tin Isles,’ said Rekh-mara, ‘then we can\nget the barbarians to help us. We will attack him by night and tear the\nsacred Amulet from his accursed heathen neck,’ he added, grinding his\nteeth.\n\n‘When shall we get to the Tin Isles?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘Oh--six months, perhaps, or a year,’ said the Egyptian cheerfully.\n\n‘A year of THIS?’ cried Jane, and Cyril, who was still feeling far too\nunwell to care about breakfast, hugged himself miserably and shuddered.\nIt was Robert who said--\n\n‘Look here, we can shorten that year. Jane, out with the Amulet! Wish\nthat we were where the Amulet will be when the ship is twenty miles from\nthe Tin Island. That’ll give us time to mature our plans.’\n\nIt was done--the work of a moment--and there they were on the same ship,\nbetween grey northern sky and grey northern sea. The sun was setting\nin a pale yellow line. It was the same ship, but it was changed, and\nso were the crew. Weather-worn and dirty were the sailors, and their\nclothes torn and ragged. And the children saw that, of course, though\nthey had skipped the nine months, the ship had had to live through them.\nPheles looked thinner, and his face was rugged and anxious.\n\n‘Ha!’ he cried, ‘the charm has brought you back! I have prayed to it\ndaily these nine months--and now you are here? Have you no magic that\ncan help?’\n\n‘What is your need?’ asked the Egyptian quietly.\n\n‘I need a great wave that shall whelm away the foreign ship that follows\nus. A month ago it lay in wait for us, by the pillars of the gods, and\nit follows, follows, to find out the secret of Tyre--the place of the\nTin Islands. If I could steer by night I could escape them yet, but\ntonight there will be no stars.’\n\n‘My magic will not serve you here,’ said the Egyptian.\n\nBut Robert said, ‘My magic will not bring up great waves, but I can show\nyou how to steer without stars.’\n\nHe took out the shilling compass, still, fortunately, in working order,\nthat he had bought off another boy at school for fivepence, a piece of\nindiarubber, a strip of whalebone, and half a stick of red sealing-wax.\n\nAnd he showed Pheles how it worked. And Pheles wondered at the compass’s\nmagic truth.\n\n‘I will give it to you,’ Robert said, ‘in return for that charm about\nyour neck.’\n\nPheles made no answer. He first laughed, snatched the compass from\nRobert’s hand, and turned away still laughing.\n\n‘Be comforted,’ the Priest whispered, ‘our time will come.’\n\nThe dusk deepened, and Pheles, crouched beside a dim lantern, steered by\nthe shilling compass from the Crystal Palace.\n\nNo one ever knew how the other ship sailed, but suddenly, in the deep\nnight, the look-out man at the stern cried out in a terrible voice--\n\n‘She is close upon us!’\n\n‘And we,’ said Pheles, ‘are close to the harbour.’ He was silent a\nmoment, then suddenly he altered the ship’s course, and then he stood up\nand spoke.\n\n‘Good friends and gentlemen,’ he said, ‘who are bound with me in this\nbrave venture by our King’s command, the false, foreign ship is close\non our heels. If we land, they land, and only the gods know whether they\nmight not beat us in fight, and themselves survive to carry back the\ntale of Tyre’s secret island to enrich their own miserable land. Shall\nthis be?’\n\n‘Never!’ cried the half-dozen men near him. The slaves were rowing hard\nbelow and could not hear his words.\n\nThe Egyptian leaped upon him; suddenly, fiercely, as a wild beast leaps.\n‘Give me back my Amulet,’ he cried, and caught at the charm. The chain\nthat held it snapped, and it lay in the Priest’s hand.\n\nPheles laughed, standing balanced to the leap of the ship that answered\nthe oarstroke.\n\n‘This is no time for charms and mummeries,’ he said. ‘We’ve lived like\nmen, and we’ll die like gentlemen for the honour and glory of Tyre, our\nsplendid city. “Tyre, Tyre for ever! It’s Tyre that rules the waves.” I\nsteer her straight for the Dragon rocks, and we go down for our city,\nas brave men should. The creeping cowards who follow shall go down as\nslaves--and slaves they shall be to us--when we live again. Tyre, Tyre\nfor ever!’\n\nA great shout went up, and the slaves below joined in it.\n\n‘Quick, the Amulet,’ cried Anthea, and held it up. Rekh-mara held up the\none he had snatched from Pheles. The word was spoken, and the two great\narches grew on the plunging ship in the shrieking wind under the dark\nsky. From each Amulet a great and beautiful green light streamed and\nshone far out over the waves. It illuminated, too, the black faces and\njagged teeth of the great rocks that lay not two ships’ lengths from the\nboat’s peaked nose.\n\n‘Tyre, Tyre for ever! It’s Tyre that rules the waves!’ the voices of the\ndoomed rose in a triumphant shout. The children scrambled through the\narch, and stood trembling and blinking in the Fitzroy Street parlour,\nand in their ears still sounded the whistle of the wind, and the rattle\nof the oars, the crash of the ships bow on the rocks, and the last shout\nof the brave gentlemen-adventurers who went to their deaths singing, for\nthe sake of the city they loved.\n\n\n‘And so we’ve lost the other half of the Amulet again,’ said Anthea,\nwhen they had told the Psammead all about it.\n\n‘Nonsense, pooh!’ said the Psammead. ‘That wasn’t the other half. It was\nthe same half that you’ve got--the one that wasn’t crushed and lost.’\n\n‘But how could it be the same?’ said Anthea gently.\n\n‘Well, not exactly, of course. The one you’ve got is a good many years\nolder, but at any rate it’s not the other one. What did you say when you\nwished?’\n\n‘I forget,’ said Jane.\n\n‘I don’t,’ said the Psammead. ‘You said, “Take us where YOU are”--and it\ndid, so you see it was the same half.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘But you mark my words,’ the Psammead went on, ‘you’ll have trouble with\nthat Priest yet.’\n\n‘Why, he was quite friendly,’ said Anthea.\n\n‘All the same you’d better beware of the Reverend Rekh-mara.’\n\n‘Oh, I’m sick of the Amulet,’ said Cyril, ‘we shall never get it.’\n\n‘Oh yes we shall,’ said Robert. ‘Don’t you remember December 3rd?’\n\n‘Jinks!’ said Cyril, ‘I’d forgotten that.’\n\n‘I don’t believe it,’ said Jane, ‘and I don’t feel at all well.’\n\n‘If I were you,’ said the Psammead, ‘I should not go out into the Past\nagain till that date. You’ll find it safer not to go where you’re likely\nto meet that Egyptian any more just at present.’\n\n‘Of course we’ll do as you say,’ said Anthea soothingly, ‘though there’s\nsomething about his face that I really do like.’\n\n‘Still, you don’t want to run after him, I suppose,’ snapped the\nPsammead. ‘You wait till the 3rd, and then see what happens.’\n\nCyril and Jane were feeling far from well, Anthea was always obliging,\nso Robert was overruled. And they promised. And none of them, not even\nthe Psammead, at all foresaw, as you no doubt do quite plainly, exactly\nwhat it was that WOULD happen on that memorable date.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. THE HEART’S DESIRE\n\nIf I only had time I could tell you lots of things. For instance, how,\nin spite of the advice of the Psammead, the four children did, one very\nwet day, go through their Amulet Arch into the golden desert, and there\nfind the great Temple of Baalbec and meet with the Phoenix whom they\nnever thought to see again. And how the Phoenix did not remember them at\nall until it went into a sort of prophetic trance--if that can be called\nremembering. But, alas! I HAVEN’T time, so I must leave all that out\nthough it was a wonderfully thrilling adventure. I must leave out, too,\nall about the visit of the children to the Hippodrome with the Psammead\nin its travelling bag, and about how the wishes of the people round\nabout them were granted so suddenly and surprisingly that at last the\nPsammead had to be taken hurriedly home by Anthea, who consequently\nmissed half the performance. Then there was the time when, Nurse having\ngone to tea with a friend out Ivalunk way, they were playing ‘devil in\nthe dark’--and in the midst of that most creepy pastime the postman’s\nknock frightened Jane nearly out of her life. She took in the letters,\nhowever, and put them in the back of the hat-stand drawer, so that they\nshould be safe. And safe they were, for she never thought of them again\nfor weeks and weeks.\n\nOne really good thing happened when they took the Psammead to a\nmagic-lantern show and lecture at the boys’ school at Camden Town. The\nlecture was all about our soldiers in South Africa. And the lecturer\nended up by saying, ‘And I hope every boy in this room has in his heart\nthe seeds of courage and heroism and self-sacrifice, and I wish that\nevery one of you may grow up to be noble and brave and unselfish, worthy\ncitizens of this great Empire for whom our soldiers have freely given\ntheir lives.’\n\nAnd, of course, this came true--which was a distinct score for Camden\nTown.\n\nAs Anthea said, it was unlucky that the lecturer said boys, because now\nshe and Jane would have to be noble and unselfish, if at all, without\nany outside help. But Jane said, ‘I daresay we are already because of\nour beautiful natures. It’s only boys that have to be made brave by\nmagic’--which nearly led to a first-class row.\n\nAnd I daresay you would like to know all about the affair of the fishing\nrod, and the fish-hooks, and the cook next door--which was amusing from\nsome points of view, though not perhaps the cook’s--but there really is\nno time even for that.\n\nThe only thing that there’s time to tell about is the Adventure of\nMaskelyne and Cooke’s, and the Unexpected Apparition--which is also the\nbeginning of the end.\n\nIt was Nurse who broke into the gloomy music of the autumn rain on the\nwindow panes by suggesting a visit to the Egyptian Hall, England’s Home\nof Mystery. Though they had good, but private reasons to know that their\nown particular personal mystery was of a very different brand, the\nfour all brightened at the idea. All children, as well as a good many\ngrown-ups, love conjuring.\n\n‘It’s in Piccadilly,’ said old Nurse, carefully counting out the proper\nnumber of shillings into Cyril’s hand, ‘not so very far down on the left\nfrom the Circus. There’s big pillars outside, something like Carter’s\nseed place in Holborn, as used to be Day and Martin’s blacking when I\nwas a gell. And something like Euston Station, only not so big.’\n\n‘Yes, I know,’ said everybody.\n\nSo they started.\n\nBut though they walked along the left-hand side of Piccadilly they saw\nno pillared building that was at all like Carter’s seed warehouse or\nEuston Station or England’s Home of Mystery as they remembered it.\n\nAt last they stopped a hurried lady, and asked her the way to Maskelyne\nand Cooke’s.\n\n‘I don’t know, I’m sure,’ she said, pushing past them. ‘I always shop\nat the Stores.’ Which just shows, as Jane said, how ignorant grown-up\npeople are.\n\nIt was a policeman who at last explained to them that England’s\nMysteries are now appropriately enough enacted at St George’s Hall.\n\nSo they tramped to Langham Place, and missed the first two items in\nthe programme. But they were in time for the most wonderful magic\nappearances and disappearances, which they could hardly believe--even\nwith all their knowledge of a larger magic--was not really magic after\nall.\n\n‘If only the Babylonians could have seen THIS conjuring,’ whispered\nCyril. ‘It takes the shine out of their old conjurer, doesn’t it?’\n\n‘Hush!’ said Anthea and several other members of the audience.\n\nNow there was a vacant seat next to Robert. And it was when all eyes\nwere fixed on the stage where Mr Devant was pouring out glasses of all\nsorts of different things to drink, out of one kettle with one spout,\nand the audience were delightedly tasting them, that Robert felt someone\nin that vacant seat. He did not feel someone sit down in it. It was just\nthat one moment there was no one sitting there, and the next moment,\nsuddenly, there was someone.\n\nRobert turned. The someone who had suddenly filled that empty place was\nRekh-mara, the Priest of Amen!\n\nThough the eyes of the audience were fixed on Mr David Devant, Mr David\nDevant’s eyes were fixed on the audience. And it happened that his eyes\nwere more particularly fixed on that empty chair. So that he saw quite\nplainly the sudden appearance, from nowhere, of the Egyptian Priest.\n\n‘A jolly good trick,’ he said to himself, ‘and worked under my own eyes,\nin my own hall. I’ll find out how that’s done.’ He had never seen a\ntrick that he could not do himself if he tried.\n\nBy this time a good many eyes in the audience had turned on the\nclean-shaven, curiously-dressed figure of the Egyptian Priest.\n\n‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ said Mr Devant, rising to the occasion, ‘this\nis a trick I have never before performed. The empty seat, third from\nthe end, second row, gallery--you will now find occupied by an Ancient\nEgyptian, warranted genuine.’\n\nHe little knew how true his words were.\n\nAnd now all eyes were turned on the Priest and the children, and the\nwhole audience, after a moment’s breathless surprise, shouted applause.\nOnly the lady on the other side of Rekh-mara drew back a little. She\nKNEW no one had passed her, and, as she said later, over tea and cold\ntongue, ‘it was that sudden it made her flesh creep.’\n\nRekh-mara seemed very much annoyed at the notice he was exciting.\n\n‘Come out of this crowd,’ he whispered to Robert. ‘I must talk with you\napart.’\n\n‘Oh, no,’ Jane whispered. ‘I did so want to see the Mascot Moth, and the\nVentriloquist.’\n\n‘How did you get here?’ was Robert’s return whisper.\n\n‘How did you get to Egypt and to Tyre?’ retorted Rekh-mara. ‘Come, let\nus leave this crowd.’\n\n‘There’s no help for it, I suppose,’ Robert shrugged angrily. But they\nall got up.\n\n‘Confederates!’ said a man in the row behind. ‘Now they go round to the\nback and take part in the next scene.’\n\n‘I wish we did,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Confederate yourself!’ said Cyril. And so they got away, the audience\napplauding to the last.\n\nIn the vestibule of St George’s Hall they disguised Rekh-mara as well as\nthey could, but even with Robert’s hat and Cyril’s Inverness cape he was\ntoo striking a figure for foot-exercise in the London streets. It had to\nbe a cab, and it took the last, least money of all of them. They stopped\nthe cab a few doors from home, and then the girls went in and engaged\nold Nurse’s attention by an account of the conjuring and a fervent\nentreaty for dripping-toast with their tea, leaving the front door open\nso that while Nurse was talking to them the boys could creep quietly\nin with Rekh-mara and smuggle him, unseen, up the stairs into their\nbedroom.\n\nWhen the girls came up they found the Egyptian Priest sitting on the\nside of Cyril’s bed, his hands on his knees, looking like a statue of a\nking.\n\n‘Come on,’ said Cyril impatiently. ‘He won’t begin till we’re all here.\nAnd shut the door, can’t you?’\n\nWhen the door was shut the Egyptian said--\n\n‘My interests and yours are one.’\n\n‘Very interesting,’ said Cyril, ‘and it’ll be a jolly sight more\ninteresting if you keep following us about in a decent country with no\nmore clothes on than THAT!’\n\n‘Peace,’ said the Priest. ‘What is this country? and what is this time?’\n\n‘The country’s England,’ said Anthea, ‘and the time’s about 6,000 years\nlater than YOUR time.’\n\n‘The Amulet, then,’ said the Priest, deeply thoughtful, ‘gives the power\nto move to and fro in time as well as in space?’\n\n‘That’s about it,’ said Cyril gruffly. ‘Look here, it’ll be tea-time\ndirectly. What are we to do with you?’\n\n‘You have one-half of the Amulet, I the other,’ said Rekh-mara. ‘All\nthat is now needed is the pin to join them.’\n\n‘Don’t you think it,’ said Robert. ‘The half you’ve got is the same half\nas the one we’ve got.’\n\n‘But the same thing cannot be in the same place and the same time, and\nyet be not one, but twain,’ said the Priest. ‘See, here is my half.’ He\nlaid it on the Marcella counterpane. ‘Where is yours?’\n\nJane watching the eyes of the others, unfastened the string of the\nAmulet and laid it on the bed, but too far off for the Priest to seize\nit, even if he had been so dishonourable. Cyril and Robert stood beside\nhim, ready to spring on him if one of his hands had moved but ever so\nlittle towards the magic treasure that was theirs. But his hands did not\nmove, only his eyes opened very wide, and so did everyone else’s for\nthe Amulet the Priest had now quivered and shook; and then, as steel is\ndrawn to the magnet, it was drawn across the white counterpane, nearer\nand nearer to the Amulet, warm from the neck of Jane. And then, as one\ndrop of water mingles with another on a rain-wrinkled window-pane, as\none bead of quick-silver is drawn into another bead, Rekh-mara’s Amulet\nslipped into the other one, and, behold! there was no more but the one\nAmulet!\n\n‘Black magic!’ cried Rekh-mara, and sprang forward to snatch the Amulet\nthat had swallowed his. But Anthea caught it up, and at the same moment\nthe Priest was jerked back by a rope thrown over his head. It drew,\ntightened with the pull of his forward leap, and bound his elbows to his\nsides. Before he had time to use his strength to free himself, Robert\nhad knotted the cord behind him and tied it to the bedpost. Then the\nfour children, overcoming the priest’s wrigglings and kickings, tied his\nlegs with more rope.\n\n‘I thought,’ said Robert, breathing hard, and drawing the last knot\ntight, ‘he’d have a try for OURS, so I got the ropes out of the\nbox-room, so as to be ready.’\n\nThe girls, with rather white faces, applauded his foresight.\n\n‘Loosen these bonds!’ cried Rekh-mara in fury, ‘before I blast you with\nthe seven secret curses of Amen-Ra!’\n\n‘We shouldn’t be likely to loose them AFTER,’ Robert retorted.\n\n‘Oh, don’t quarrel!’ said Anthea desperately. ‘Look here, he has just as\nmuch right to the thing as we have. This,’ she took up the Amulet that\nhad swallowed the other one, ‘this has got his in it as well as being\nours. Let’s go shares.’\n\n‘Let me go!’ cried the Priest, writhing.\n\n‘Now, look here,’ said Robert, ‘if you make a row we can just open that\nwindow and call the police--the guards, you know--and tell them you’ve\nbeen trying to rob us. NOW will you shut up and listen to reason?’\n\n‘I suppose so,’ said Rekh-mara sulkily.\n\nBut reason could not be spoken to him till a whispered counsel had been\nheld in the far corner by the washhand-stand and the towel-horse, a\ncounsel rather long and very earnest.\n\nAt last Anthea detached herself from the group, and went back to the\nPriest.\n\n‘Look here,’ she said in her kind little voice, ‘we want to be friends.\nWe want to help you. Let’s make a treaty. Let’s join together to get the\nAmulet--the whole one, I mean. And then it shall belong to you as much\nas to us, and we shall all get our hearts’ desire.’\n\n‘Fair words,’ said the Priest, ‘grow no onions.’\n\n‘WE say, “Butter no parsnips”,’ Jane put in. ‘But don’t you see we WANT\nto be fair? Only we want to bind you in the chains of honour and upright\ndealing.’\n\n‘Will you deal fairly by us?’ said Robert.\n\n‘I will,’ said the Priest. ‘By the sacred, secret name that is written\nunder the Altar of Amen-Ra, I will deal fairly by you. Will you, too,\ntake the oath of honourable partnership?’\n\n‘No,’ said Anthea, on the instant, and added rather rashly. ‘We don’t\nswear in England, except in police courts, where the guards are,\nyou know, and you don’t want to go there. But when we SAY we’ll do a\nthing--it’s the same as an oath to us--we do it. You trust us, and we’ll\ntrust you.’ She began to unbind his legs, and the boys hastened to untie\nhis arms.\n\nWhen he was free he stood up, stretched his arms, and laughed.\n\n‘Now,’ he said, ‘I am stronger than you and my oath is void. I have\nsworn by nothing, and my oath is nothing likewise. For there IS no\nsecret, sacred name under the altar of Amen-Ra.’\n\n‘Oh, yes there is!’ said a voice from under the bed. Everyone\nstarted--Rekh-mara most of all.\n\nCyril stooped and pulled out the bath of sand where the Psammead slept.\n‘You don’t know everything, though you ARE a Divine Father of the Temple\nof Amen,’ said the Psammead shaking itself till the sand fell tinkling\non the bath edge. ‘There IS a secret, sacred name beneath the altar of\nAmen-Ra. Shall I call on that name?’\n\n‘No, no!’ cried the Priest in terror.\n\n‘No,’ said Jane, too. ‘Don’t let’s have any calling names.’\n\n‘Besides,’ said Rekh-mara, who had turned very white indeed under his\nnatural brownness, ‘I was only going to say that though there isn’t any\nname under--’\n\n‘There IS,’ said the Psammead threateningly.\n\n‘Well, even if there WASN’T, I will be bound by the wordless oath\nof your strangely upright land, and having said that I will be your\nfriend--I will be it.’\n\n‘Then that’s all right,’ said the Psammead; ‘and there’s the tea-bell.\nWhat are you going to do with your distinguished partner? He can’t go\ndown to tea like that, you know.’\n\n‘You see we can’t do anything till the 3rd of December,’ said Anthea,\n‘that’s when we are to find the whole charm. What can we do with\nRekh-mara till then?’\n\n‘Box-room,’ said Cyril briefly, ‘and smuggle up his meals. It will be\nrather fun.’\n\n‘Like a fleeing Cavalier concealed from exasperated Roundheads,’ said\nRobert. ‘Yes.’\n\nSo Rekh-mara was taken up to the box-room and made as comfortable as\npossible in a snug nook between an old nursery fender and the wreck of\na big four-poster. They gave him a big rag-bag to sit on, and an old,\nmoth-eaten fur coat off the nail on the door to keep him warm. And when\nthey had had their own tea they took him some. He did not like the tea\nat all, but he liked the bread and butter, and cake that went with it.\nThey took it in turns to sit with him during the evening, and left him\nfairly happy and quite settled for the night.\n\n\nBut when they went up in the morning with a kipper, a quarter of which\neach of them had gone without at breakfast, Rekh-mara was gone! There\nwas the cosy corner with the rag-bag, and the moth-eaten fur coat--but\nthe cosy corner was empty.\n\n‘Good riddance!’ was naturally the first delightful thought in each\nmind. The second was less pleasing, because everyone at once remembered\nthat since his Amulet had been swallowed up by theirs--which hung\nonce more round the neck of Jane--he could have no possible means of\nreturning to his Egyptian past. Therefore he must be still in England,\nand probably somewhere quite near them, plotting mischief.\n\nThe attic was searched, to prevent mistakes, but quite vainly.\n\n‘The best thing we can do,’ said Cyril, ‘is to go through the half\nAmulet straight away, get the whole Amulet, and come back.’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ Anthea hesitated. ‘Would that be quite fair? Perhaps he\nisn’t really a base deceiver. Perhaps something’s happened to him.’\n\n‘Happened?’ said Cyril, ‘not it! Besides, what COULD happen?’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ said Anthea. ‘Perhaps burglars came in the night, and\naccidentally killed him, and took away the--all that was mortal of him,\nyou know--to avoid discovery.’\n\n‘Or perhaps,’ said Cyril, ‘they hid the--all that was mortal, in one of\nthose big trunks in the box-room. SHALL WE GO BACK AND LOOK?’ he added\ngrimly.\n\n‘No, no!’ Jane shuddered. ‘Let’s go and tell the Psammead and see what\nit says.’\n\n‘No,’ said Anthea, ‘let’s ask the learned gentleman. If anything has\nhappened to Rekh-mara a gentleman’s advice would be more useful than a\nPsammead’s. And the learned gentleman’ll only think it’s a dream, like\nhe always does.’\n\nThey tapped at the door, and on the ‘Come in’ entered. The learned\ngentleman was sitting in front of his untasted breakfast.\n\nOpposite him, in the easy chair, sat Rekh-mara!\n\n‘Hush!’ said the learned gentleman very earnestly, ‘please, hush! or the\ndream will go. I am learning... Oh, what have I not learned in the last\nhour!’\n\n‘In the grey dawn,’ said the Priest, ‘I left my hiding-place, and\nfinding myself among these treasures from my own country, I remained. I\nfeel more at home here somehow.’\n\n‘Of course I know it’s a dream,’ said the learned gentleman feverishly,\n‘but, oh, ye gods! what a dream! By jove!...’\n\n‘Call not upon the gods,’ said the Priest, ‘lest ye raise greater ones\nthan ye can control. Already,’ he explained to the children, ‘he and I\nare as brothers, and his welfare is dear to me as my own.’\n\n‘He has told me,’ the learned gentleman began, but Robert interrupted.\nThis was no moment for manners.\n\n‘Have you told him,’ he asked the Priest, ‘all about the Amulet?’\n\n‘No,’ said Rekh-mara.\n\n‘Then tell him now. He is very learned. Perhaps he can tell us what to\ndo.’\n\nRekh-mara hesitated, then told--and, oddly enough, none of the children\never could remember afterwards what it was that he did tell. Perhaps he\nused some magic to prevent their remembering.\n\nWhen he had done the learned gentleman was silent, leaning his elbow on\nthe table and his head on his hand.\n\n‘Dear Jimmy,’ said Anthea gently, ‘don’t worry about it. We are sure to\nfind it today, somehow.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Rekh-mara, ‘and perhaps, with it, Death.’\n\n‘It’s to bring us our hearts’ desire,’ said Robert.\n\n‘Who knows,’ said the Priest, ‘what things undreamed-of and infinitely\ndesirable lie beyond the dark gates?’\n\n‘Oh, DON’T,’ said Jane, almost whimpering.\n\nThe learned gentleman raised his head suddenly.\n\n‘Why not,’ he suggested, ‘go back into the Past? At a moment when the\nAmulet is unwatched. Wish to be with it, and that it shall be under your\nhand.’\n\nIt was the simplest thing in the world! And yet none of them had ever\nthought of it.\n\n‘Come,’ cried Rekh-mara, leaping up. ‘Come NOW!’\n\n‘May--may I come?’ the learned gentleman timidly asked. ‘It’s only a\ndream, you know.’\n\n‘Come, and welcome, oh brother,’ Rekh-mara was beginning, but Cyril and\nRobert with one voice cried, ‘NO.’\n\n‘You weren’t with us in Atlantis,’ Robert added, ‘or you’d know better\nthan to let him come.’\n\n‘Dear Jimmy,’ said Anthea, ‘please don’t ask to come. We’ll go and be\nback again before you have time to know that we’re gone.’\n\n‘And he, too?’\n\n‘We must keep together,’ said Rekh-mara, ‘since there is but one perfect\nAmulet to which I and these children have equal claims.’\n\nJane held up the Amulet--Rekh-mara went first--and they all passed\nthrough the great arch into which the Amulet grew at the Name of Power.\n\nThe learned gentleman saw through the arch a darkness lighted by smoky\ngleams. He rubbed his eyes. And he only rubbed them for ten seconds.\n\n\nThe children and the Priest were in a small, dark chamber. A square\ndoorway of massive stone let in gleams of shifting light, and the sound\nof many voices chanting a slow, strange hymn. They stood listening. Now\nand then the chant quickened and the light grew brighter, as though fuel\nhad been thrown on a fire.\n\n‘Where are we?’ whispered Anthea.\n\n‘And when?’ whispered Robert.\n\n‘This is some shrine near the beginnings of belief,’ said the Egyptian\nshivering. ‘Take the Amulet and come away. It is cold here in the\nmorning of the world.’\n\nAnd then Jane felt that her hand was on a slab or table of stone, and,\nunder her hand, something that felt like the charm that had so long hung\nround her neck, only it was thicker. Twice as thick.\n\n‘It’s HERE!’ she said, ‘I’ve got it!’ And she hardly knew the sound of\nher own voice.\n\n‘Come away,’ repeated Rekh-mara.\n\n‘I wish we could see more of this Temple,’ said Robert resistingly.\n\n‘Come away,’ the Priest urged, ‘there is death all about, and strong\nmagic. Listen.’\n\nThe chanting voices seemed to have grown louder and fiercer, and light\nstronger.\n\n‘They are coming!’ cried Rekh-mara. ‘Quick, quick, the Amulet!’\n\nJane held it up.\n\n\n‘What a long time you’ve been rubbing your eyes!’ said Anthea; ‘don’t\nyou see we’ve got back?’ The learned gentleman merely stared at her.\n\n‘Miss Anthea--Miss Jane!’ It was Nurse’s voice, very much higher and\nsqueaky and more exalted than usual.\n\n‘Oh, bother!’ said everyone. Cyril adding, ‘You just go on with the\ndream for a sec, Mr Jimmy, we’ll be back directly. Nurse’ll come up if\nwe don’t. SHE wouldn’t think Rekh-mara was a dream.’\n\nThen they went down. Nurse was in the hall, an orange envelope in one\nhand, and a pink paper in the other.\n\n‘Your Pa and Ma’s come home. “Reach London 11.15. Prepare rooms as\ndirected in letter”, and signed in their two names.’\n\n‘Oh, hooray! hooray! hooray!’ shouted the boys and Jane. But Anthea\ncould not shout, she was nearer crying.\n\n‘Oh,’ she said almost in a whisper, ‘then it WAS true. And we HAVE got\nour hearts’ desire.’\n\n‘But I don’t understand about the letter,’ Nurse was saying. ‘I haven’t\nHAD no letter.’\n\n‘OH!’ said Jane in a queer voice, ‘I wonder whether it was one of\nthose... they came that night--you know, when we were playing “devil\nin the dark”--and I put them in the hat-stand drawer, behind the\nclothes-brushes and’--she pulled out the drawer as she spoke--‘and here\nthey are!’\n\nThere was a letter for Nurse and one for the children. The letters told\nhow Father had done being a war-correspondent and was coming home; and\nhow Mother and The Lamb were going to meet him in Italy and all come\nhome together; and how The Lamb and Mother were quite well; and how\na telegram would be sent to tell the day and the hour of their\nhome-coming.\n\n‘Mercy me!’ said old Nurse. ‘I declare if it’s not too bad of You, Miss\nJane. I shall have a nice to-do getting things straight for your Pa and\nMa.’\n\n‘Oh, never mind, Nurse,’ said Jane, hugging her; ‘isn’t it just too\nlovely for anything!’\n\n‘We’ll come and help you,’ said Cyril. ‘There’s just something upstairs\nwe’ve got to settle up, and then we’ll all come and help you.’\n\n‘Get along with you,’ said old Nurse, but she laughed jollily. ‘Nice\nhelp YOU’D be. I know you. And it’s ten o’clock now.’\n\n\nThere was, in fact, something upstairs that they had to settle. Quite a\nconsiderable something, too. And it took much longer than they expected.\n\nA hasty rush into the boys’ room secured the Psammead, very sandy and\nvery cross.\n\n‘It doesn’t matter how cross and sandy it is though,’ said Anthea, ‘it\nought to be there at the final council.’\n\n‘It’ll give the learned gentleman fits, I expect,’ said Robert, ‘when he\nsees it.’\n\nBut it didn’t.\n\n‘The dream is growing more and more wonderful,’ he exclaimed, when the\nPsammead had been explained to him by Rekh-mara. ‘I have dreamed this\nbeast before.’\n\n‘Now,’ said Robert, ‘Jane has got the half Amulet and I’ve got the\nwhole. Show up, Jane.’\n\nJane untied the string and laid her half Amulet on the table, littered\nwith dusty papers, and the clay cylinders marked all over with little\nmarks like the little prints of birds’ little feet. Robert laid down the\nwhole Amulet, and Anthea gently restrained the eager hand of the learned\ngentleman as it reached out yearningly towards the ‘perfect specimen’.\n\nAnd then, just as before on the Marcella quilt, so now on the dusty\nlitter of papers and curiosities, the half Amulet quivered and shook,\nand then, as steel is drawn to a magnet, it was drawn across the dusty\nmanuscripts, nearer and nearer to the perfect Amulet, warm from the\npocket of Robert. And then, as one drop of water mingles with another\nwhen the panes of the window are wrinkled with rain, as one bead of\nmercury is drawn into another bead, the half Amulet, that was the\nchildren’s and was also Rekh-mara’s,--slipped into the whole Amulet,\nand, behold! there was only one--the perfect and ultimate Charm.\n\n‘And THAT’S all right,’ said the Psammead, breaking a breathless\nsilence.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Anthea, ‘and we’ve got our hearts’ desire. Father and Mother\nand The Lamb are coming home today.’\n\n‘But what about me?’ said Rekh-mara.\n\n‘What IS your heart’s desire?’ Anthea asked.\n\n‘Great and deep learning,’ said the Priest, without a moment’s\nhesitation. ‘A learning greater and deeper than that of any man of my\nland and my time. But learning too great is useless. If I go back to my\nown land and my own age, who will believe my tales of what I have seen\nin the future? Let me stay here, be the great knower of all that has\nbeen, in that our time, so living to me, so old to you, about which your\nlearned men speculate unceasingly, and often, HE tells me, vainly.’\n\n‘If I were you,’ said the Psammead, ‘I should ask the Amulet about that.\nIt’s a dangerous thing, trying to live in a time that’s not your own.\nYou can’t breathe an air that’s thousands of centuries ahead of your\nlungs without feeling the effects of it, sooner or later. Prepare the\nmystic circle and consult the Amulet.’\n\n‘Oh, WHAT a dream!’ cried the learned gentleman. ‘Dear children, if\nyou love me--and I think you do, in dreams and out of them--prepare the\nmystic circle and consult the Amulet!’\n\nThey did. As once before, when the sun had shone in August splendour,\nthey crouched in a circle on the floor. Now the air outside was thick\nand yellow with the fog that by some strange decree always attends the\nCattle Show week. And in the street costers were shouting. ‘Ur Hekau\nSetcheh,’ Jane said the Name of Power. And instantly the light went\nout, and all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence and\na darkness, both deeper than any darkness or silence that you have ever\neven dreamed of imagining. It was like being deaf or blind, only darker\nand quieter even than that.\n\nThen out of that vast darkness and silence came a light and a voice. The\nlight was too faint to see anything by, and the voice was too small\nfor you to hear what it said. But the light and the voice grew. And the\nlight was the light that no man may look on and live, and the voice was\nthe sweetest and most terrible voice in the world. The children cast\ndown their eyes. And so did everyone.\n\n‘I speak,’ said the voice. ‘What is it that you would hear?’\n\nThere was a pause. Everyone was afraid to speak.\n\n‘What are we to do about Rekh-mara?’ said Robert suddenly and abruptly.\n‘Shall he go back through the Amulet to his own time, or--’\n\n‘No one can pass through the Amulet now,’ said the beautiful, terrible\nvoice, ‘to any land or any time. Only when it was imperfect could such\nthings be. But men may pass through the perfect charm to the perfect\nunion, which is not of time or space.’\n\n‘Would you be so very kind,’ said Anthea tremulously, ‘as to speak so\nthat we can understand you? The Psammead said something about Rekh-mara\nnot being able to live here, and if he can’t get back--’ She stopped,\nher heart was beating desperately in her throat, as it seemed.\n\n‘Nobody can continue to live in a land and in a time not appointed,’\nsaid the voice of glorious sweetness. ‘But a soul may live, if in that\nother time and land there be found a soul so akin to it as to offer it\nrefuge, in the body of that land and time, that thus they two may be one\nsoul in one body.’\n\nThe children exchanged discouraged glances. But the eyes of Rekh-mara\nand the learned gentleman met, and were kind to each other, and promised\neach other many things, secret and sacred and very beautiful.\n\nAnthea saw the look. ‘Oh, but,’ she said, without at all meaning to say\nit, ‘dear Jimmy’s soul isn’t at all like Rekh-mara’s. I’m certain it\nisn’t. I don’t want to be rude, but it ISN’T, you know. Dear Jimmy’s\nsoul is as good as gold, and--’\n\n‘Nothing that is not good can pass beneath the double arch of my perfect\nAmulet,’ said the voice. ‘If both are willing, say the word of Power,\nand let the two souls become one for ever and ever more.’\n\n‘Shall I?’ asked Jane.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\nThe voices were those of the Egyptian Priest and the learned gentleman,\nand the voices were eager, alive, thrilled with hope and the desire of\ngreat things.\n\nSo Jane took the Amulet from Robert and held it up between the two men,\nand said, for the last time, the word of Power.\n\n‘Ur Hekau Setcheh.’\n\nThe perfect Amulet grew into a double arch; the two arches leaned to\neach other making a great A.\n\n‘A stands for Amen,’ whispered Jane; ‘what he was a priest of.’\n\n‘Hush!’ breathed Anthea.\n\nThe great double arch glowed in and through the green light that had\nbeen there since the Name of Power had first been spoken--it glowed\nwith a light more bright yet more soft than the other light--a glory and\nsplendour and sweetness unspeakable. ‘Come!’ cried Rekh-mara, holding\nout his hands.\n\n‘Come!’ cried the learned gentleman, and he also held out his hands.\n\nEach moved forward under the glowing, glorious arch of the perfect\nAmulet.\n\nThen Rekh-mara quavered and shook, and as steel is drawn to a magnet\nhe was drawn, under the arch of magic, nearer and nearer to the learned\ngentleman. And, as one drop of water mingles with another, when the\nwindow-glass is rain-wrinkled, as one quick-silver bead is drawn to\nanother quick-silver bead, Rekh-mara, Divine Father of the Temple of\nAmen-Ra, was drawn into, slipped into, disappeared into, and was one\nwith Jimmy, the good, the beloved, the learned gentleman.\n\nAnd suddenly it was good daylight and the December sun shone. The fog\nhas passed away like a dream.\n\nThe Amulet was there--little and complete in jane’s hand, and there\nwere the other children and the Psammead, and the learned gentleman. But\nRekh-mara--or the body of Rekh-mara--was not there any more. As for his\nsoul...\n\n‘Oh, the horrid thing!’ cried Robert, and put his foot on a centipede\nas long as your finger, that crawled and wriggled and squirmed at the\nlearned gentleman’s feet.\n\n‘THAT,’ said the Psammead, ‘WAS the evil in the soul of Rekh-mara.’\n\nThere was a deep silence.\n\n‘Then Rekh-mara’s HIM now?’ said Jane at last.\n\n‘All that was good in Rekh-mara,’ said the Psammead.\n\n‘HE ought to have his heart’s desire, too,’ said Anthea, in a sort of\nstubborn gentleness.\n\n‘HIS heart’s desire,’ said the Psammead, ‘is the perfect Amulet you hold\nin your hand. Yes--and has been ever since he first saw the broken half\nof it.’\n\n‘We’ve got ours,’ said Anthea softly.\n\n‘Yes,’ said the Psammead--its voice was crosser than they had ever heard\nit--‘your parents are coming home. And what’s to become of ME? I shall\nbe found out, and made a show of, and degraded in every possible way. I\nKNOW they’ll make me go into Parliament--hateful place--all mud and no\nsand. That beautiful Baalbec temple in the desert! Plenty of good sand\nthere, and no politics! I wish I were there, safe in the Past--that I\ndo.’\n\n‘I wish you were,’ said the learned gentleman absently, yet polite as\never.\n\nThe Psammead swelled itself up, turned its long snail’s eyes in one\nlast lingering look at Anthea--a loving look, she always said, and\nthought--and--vanished.\n\n‘Well,’ said Anthea, after a silence, ‘I suppose it’s happy. The only\nthing it ever did really care for was SAND.’\n\n‘My dear children,’ said the learned gentleman, ‘I must have fallen\nasleep. I’ve had the most extraordinary dream.’\n\n‘I hope it was a nice one,’ said Cyril with courtesy.\n\n‘Yes.... I feel a new man after it. Absolutely a new man.’\n\nThere was a ring at the front-door bell. The opening of a door. Voices.\n\n‘It’s THEM!’ cried Robert, and a thrill ran through four hearts.\n\n‘Here!’ cried Anthea, snatching the Amulet from Jane and pressing it\ninto the hand of the learned gentleman. ‘Here--it’s yours--your very\nown--a present from us, because you’re Rekh-mara as well as... I mean,\nbecause you’re such a dear.’\n\nShe hugged him briefly but fervently, and the four swept down the stairs\nto the hall, where a cabman was bringing in boxes, and where,\nheavily disguised in travelling cloaks and wraps, was their hearts’\ndesire--three-fold--Mother, Father, and The Lamb.\n\n\n‘Bless me!’ said the learned gentleman, left alone, ‘bless me! What a\ntreasure! The dear children! It must be their affection that has given\nme these luminous apercus. I seem to see so many things now--things I\nnever saw before! The dear children! The dear, dear children!’\n",
