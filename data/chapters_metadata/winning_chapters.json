THE OUTLAWS.\n\n\nIt was a bright morning in the month of August, when a lad of some\nfifteen years of age, sitting on a low wall, watched party after party of\narmed men riding up to the castle of the Earl of Evesham. A casual\nobserver glancing at his curling hair and bright open face, as also at\nthe fashion of his dress, would at once have assigned to him a purely\nSaxon origin; but a keener eye would have detected signs that Norman\nblood ran also in his veins, for his figure was lither and lighter, his\nfeatures more straightly and shapely cut, than was common among Saxons.\nHis dress consisted of a tight-fitting jerkin, descending nearly to his\nknees. The material was a light-blue cloth, while over his shoulder hung\na short cloak of a darker hue. His cap was of Saxon fashion, and he wore\non one side a little plume of a heron. In a somewhat costly belt hung a\nlight short sword, while across his knees lay a crossbow, in itself\nalmost a sure sign of its bearer being of other than Saxon blood. The boy\nlooked anxiously as party after party rode past towards the castle.\n\n\"I would give something,\" he said, \"to know what wind blows these knaves\nhere. From every petty castle in the Earl's feu the retainers seem\nhurrying here. Is he bent, I wonder, on settling once and for all his\nquarrels with the Baton of Wortham? or can he be intending to make a\nclear sweep of the woods? Ah! here comes my gossip Hubert; he may tell me\nthe meaning of this gathering.\"\n\nLeaping to his feet, the speaker started at a brisk walk to meet a\njovial-looking personage coming down from the direction of the castle.\nThe new comer was dressed in the attire of a falconer, and two dogs\nfollowed at his heels.\n\n\"Ah, Master Cuthbert,\" he said, \"what brings you so near to the castle?\nIt is not often that you favour us with your presence.\"\n\n\"I am happier in the woods, as you well know, and was on my way thither\nbut now, when I paused at the sight of all these troopers flocking in to\nEvesham. What enterprise has Sir Walter on hand now, think you?\"\n\n\"The earl keeps his own counsel,\" said the falconer, \"but methinks a\nshrewd guess might be made at the purport of the gathering. It was but\nthree days since that his foresters were beaten back by the landless\nmen, whom they caught in the very act of cutting up a fat buck. As thou\nknowest, my lord though easy and well-disposed to all, and not fond of\nharassing and driving the people as are many of his neighbours, is yet\nto the full as fanatical anent his forest privileges as the worst of\nthem. They tell me that when the news came in of the poor figure that\nhis foresters cut with broken bows and draggled plumes--for the varlets\nhad soused them in a pond of not over savoury water--he swore a great\noath that he would clear the forest of the bands. It may be, indeed,\nthat this gathering is for the purpose of falling in force upon that\nevil-disposed and most treacherous baron, Sir John of Wortham, who has\nalready begun to harry some of the outlying lands, and has driven off, I\nhear, many heads of cattle. It is a quarrel which will have to be fought\nout sooner or later, and the sooner the better, say I. Although I am no\nman of war, and love looking after my falcons or giving food to my dogs\nfar more than exchanging hard blows, yet would I gladly don the buff and\nsteel coat to aid in levelling the keep of that robber and tyrant, Sir\nJohn of Wortham.\"\n\n\"Thanks, good Hubert,\" said the lad. \"I must not stand gossiping here.\nThe news you have told me, as you know, touches me closely, for I would\nnot that harm should come to the forest men.\"\n\n\"Let it not out, I beseech thee, Cuthbert, that the news came from me,\nfor temperate as Sir Walter is at most times, he would, methinks, give\nme short shift did he know that the wagging of my tongue might have\ngiven warning through which the outlaws of the Chase should slip through\nhis fingers.\"\n\n\"Fear not, Hubert; I can be mum when the occasion needs. Can you tell me\nfarther, when the bands now gathering are likely to set forth?\"\n\n\"In brief breathing space,\" the falconer replied. \"Those who first\narrived I left swilling beer, and devouring pies and other provisions\ncooked for them last night, and from what I hear, they will set forth as\nsoon as the last comer has arrived. Whichever be their quarry, they will\ntry to fall upon it before the news of their arrival is bruited abroad.\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand to the falconer the boy started. Leaving the\nroad, and striking across the slightly undulated country dotted here\nand there by groups of trees, the lad ran at a brisk trot, without\nstopping to halt or breathe, until after half an hour's run he arrived\nat the entrance of a building, whose aspect proclaimed it to be the\nabode of a Saxon franklin of some importance. It would not be called a\ncastle, but was rather a fortified house, with a few windows looking\nwithout, and surrounded by a moat crossed by a drawbridge, and capable\nof sustaining anything short of a real attack. Erstwood had but lately\npassed into Norman hands, and was indeed at present owned by a Saxon.\nSir William de Lance, the father of the lad who is now entering its\nportals, was a friend and follower of the Earl of Evesham; and soon\nafter his lord had married Gweneth the heiress of all these fair\nlands--given to him by the will of the king, to whom by the death of\nher father she became a ward--Sir William had married Editha, the\ndaughter and heiress of the franklin of Erstwood, a cousin and dear\nfriend of the new Countess of Evesham.\n\nIn neither couple could the marriage at first have been called one of\ninclination on the part of the ladies, but love came after marriage.\nAlthough the knights and barons of the Norman invasion would, no doubt,\nbe considered rude and rough in these days of broadcloth and\ncivilization, yet their manners were gentle and polished by the side of\nthose of the rough though kindly Saxon franklins; and although the Saxon\nmaids were doubtless as patriotic as their fathers and mothers, yet the\nfemale mind is greatly led by gentle manners and courteous address. Thus\nthen, when bidden or forced to give their hands to the Norman knights,\nthey speedily accepted their lot, and for the most part grew contented\nand happy enough. In their changed circumstances it was pleasanter to\nride by the side of their Norman husbands, surrounded by a gay cavalcade,\nto hawk and to hunt, than to discharge the quiet duties of mistress of a\nSaxon farm-house. In many cases, of course, their lot was rendered\nwretched by the violence and brutality of their lords; but in the\nmajority they were well satisfied with their lot, and these mixed\nmarriages did more to bring the peoples together and weld them in one,\nthan all the laws and decrees of the Norman sovereigns.\n\nThis had certainly been the case with Editha, whose marriage with Sir\nWilliam had been one of the greatest happiness. She had lost him, three\nyears before the story begins, fighting in Normandy, in one of the\ninnumerable wars in which our first Norman kings were constantly\ninvolved. On entering the gates of Erstwood, Cuthbert had rushed hastily\nto the room where his mother was sitting with three or four of her\nmaidens, engaged in work.\n\n\"I want to speak to you at once, mother,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it now, my son?\" said his mother, who was still young and very\ncomely. Waving her hand to the girls, they left her.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, when they were alone, \"I fear me that Sir Walter is\nabout to make a great raid upon the outlaws. Armed men have been coming\nin all the morning from the castles round, and if it be not against the\nBaron de Wortham that these preparations are intended, and methinks it is\nnot, it must needs be against the landless men.\"\n\n\"What would you do, Cuthbert?\" his mother asked anxiously. \"It will not\ndo for you to be found meddling in these matters. At present you stand\nwell in the favour of the Earl, who loves you for the sake of his\nwife, to whom you are kin, and of your father, who did him good\nliegeman's service.\"\n\n\"But, mother, I have many friends in the wood. There is Cnut, their\nchief, your own first cousin, and many others of our friends, all\ngood men and true, though forced by the cruel Norman laws to refuge\nin the woods.\"\n\n\"What would you do?\" again his mother asked.\n\n\"I would take Ronald my pony and ride to warn them of the danger that\nthreatens.\"\n\n\"You had best go on foot, my son. Doubtless men have been set to see that\nnone from the Saxon homesteads carry the warning to the woods. The\ndistance is not beyond your reach, for you have often wandered there, and\non foot you can evade the eye of the watchers; but one thing, my son, you\nmust promise, and that is, that in no case, should the Earl and his bands\nmeet with the outlaws, will you take part in any fray or struggle.\"\n\n\"That will I willingly, mother,\" he said. \"I have no cause for offence\nagainst the castle or the forest, and my blood and my kin are with both.\nI would fain save shedding of blood in a quarrel like this. I hope that\nthe time may come when Saxon and Norman may fight side by side, and I\nmaybe there to see.\"\n\nA few minutes later, having changed his blue doublet for one of more\nsober and less noticeable colour, Cuthbert started for the great forest,\nwhich then stretched to within a mile of Erstwood. In those days a large\npart of the country was covered with forest, and the policy of the\nNormans in preserving these woods for the chase, tended to prevent the\nincrease of cultivation.\n\nThe farms and cultivated lands were all held by Saxons, who although\nnominally handed over to the nobles to whom William and his successors\nhad given the fiefs, saw but little of their Norman masters. These stood,\nindeed, much in the position in which landlords stand to their tenants,\npayment being made, for the most part, in produce. At the edge of the\nwood the trees grew comparatively far apart, but as Cuthbert proceeded\nfarther into its recesses, the trees in the virgin forest stood thick and\nclose together. Here and there open glades ran across each other, and in\nthese his sharp eye, accustomed to the forest, could often see the stags\nstarting away at the sound of his footsteps.\n\nIt was a full hour's journey before Cuthbert reached the point for\nwhich he was bound. Here, in an open space, probably cleared by a storm\nages before, and overshadowed by giant trees, was a group of men of all\nages and appearances. Some were occupied in stripping the skin off a\nbuck which hung from the bough of one of the trees. Others were\nroasting portions of the carcass of another deer. A few sat apart, some\ntalking, others busy in making arrows, while a few lay asleep on the\ngreensward. As Cuthbert entered the clearing, several of the party rose\nto their feet.\n\n\"Ah, Cuthbert,\" shouted a man of almost gigantic stature, who appeared to\nbe one of the leaders of the party, \"what brings you here, lad, so early?\nYou are not wont to visit us till even, when you can lay your crossbow at\na stag by moonlight.\"\n\n\"No, no, Cousin Cnut,\" Cuthbert said, \"thou canst not say that I have\never broken the forest laws, though I have looked on often and often,\nwhilst you have done so.\"\n\n\"The abettor is as bad as the thief,\" laughed Cnut, \"and if the foresters\ncaught us in the act, I wot they would make but little difference whether\nit was the shaft of my longbow or the quarrel from thy crossbow which\nbrought down the quarry. But again, lad, why comest thou here? for I see\nby the sweat on your face and by the heaving of your sides that you have\nrun fast and far.\"\n\n\"I have, Cnut; I have not once stopped for breathing since I left\nErstwood. I have come to warn you of danger. The earl is preparing\nfor a raid.\"\n\nCnut laughed somewhat disdainfully.\n\n\"He has raided here before, and I trow has carried off no game. The\nlandless men of the forest can hold their own against a handful of Norman\nknights and retainers in their own home.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Cuthbert, \"but this will be no common raid. This morning bands\nfrom all the holds within miles round are riding in, and at least 500\nmen-at-arms are likely to do chase today.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" said Cnut, while exclamations of surprise, but not of\napprehension, broke from those standing round. \"If that be so, lad, you\nhave done us good service indeed. With fair warning we can slip through\nthe fingers of ten times 500 men, but if they came upon us unawares, and\nhemmed us in it would fare but badly with us, though we should, I doubt\nnot give a good account of them before their battle-axes and maces ended\nthe strife. Have you any idea by which road they will enter the forest,\nor what are their intentions?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" Cuthbert said; \"all that I gathered was that the earl\nintended to sweep the forest, and to put an end to the breaches of the\nlaws, not to say of the rough treatment that his foresters have met with\nat your hands. You had best, methinks, be off before Sir Walter and his\nheavily-armed men are here. The forest, large as it is, will scarce hold\nyou both, and methinks you had best shift your quarters to Langholm Chase\nuntil the storm has passed.\"\n\n\"To Langholm be it, then,\" said Cnut, \"though I love not the place. Sir\nJohn of Wortham is a worse neighbour by far than the earl. Against the\nlatter we bear no malice, he is a good knight and a fair lord; and could\nhe free himself of the Norman notions that the birds of the air, and the\nbeasts of the field, and the fishes of the water, all belong to Normans,\nand that we Saxons have no share in them, I should have no quarrel with\nhim. He grinds not his neighbours, he is content with a fair tithe of the\nproduce, and as between man and man is a fair judge without favour. The\nbaron is a fiend incarnate; did he not fear that he would lose by so\ndoing, he would gladly cut the throats, or burn, or drown, or hang every\nSaxon within twenty miles of his hold. He is a disgrace to his order, and\nsome day when our band gathers a little stronger, we will burn his nest\nabout his ears.\"\n\n\"It will be a hard nut to crack,\" Cuthbert said, laughing. \"With such\narms as you have in the forest the enterprise would be something akin to\nscaling the skies.\"\n\n\"Ladders and axes will go far, lad, and the Norman men-at-arms have\nlearned to dread our shafts. But enough of the baron; if we must be his\nneighbours for a time, so be it.\"\n\n\"You have heard, my mates,\" he said, turning to his comrades gathered\naround him, \"what Cuthbert tells us. Are you of my opinion, that it is\nbetter to move away till the storm is past, than to fight against heavy\nodds, without much chance of either booty or victory?\"\n\nA general chorus proclaimed that the outlaws approved of the proposal for\na move to Langholm Chase. The preparations were simple. Bows were taken\ndown from the boughs on which they were hanging, quivers slung across the\nbacks, short cloaks thrown over the shoulders. The deer was hurriedly\ndismembered, and the joints fastened to a pole slung on the shoulders of\ntwo of the men. The drinking-cups, some of which were of silver, looking\nstrangely out of place among the rough horn implements and platters, were\nbundled together, carried a short distance and dropped among some thick\nbushes for safety; and then the band started for Wortham.\n\nWith a cordial farewell and many thanks to Cuthbert, who declined their\ninvitations to accompany them, the retreat to Langholm commenced.\n\nCuthbert, not knowing in which direction the bands were likely to\napproach, remained for a while motionless, intently listening.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour he heard the distant note of a bugle.\n\nIt was answered in three different directions, and Cuthbert, who knew\nevery path and glade of the forest, was able pretty accurately to surmise\nthose by which the various bands were commencing to enter the wood.\n\nKnowing that they were still a long way off, he advanced as rapidly as he\ncould in the direction in which they were coming. When by the sound of\ndistant voices and the breaking of branches he knew that one at least of\nthe parties was near at hand, he rapidly climbed a thick tree and\nensconced himself in the branches, and there watched, secure and hidden\nfrom the sharpest eye, the passage of a body of men-at-arms fully a\nhundred strong, led by Sir Walter himself, accompanied by some half\ndozen of his knights.\n\nWhen they had passed, Cuthbert again slipped down the tree and made at\nall speed for home. He reached it, so far as he knew without having been\nobserved by a single passer-by.\n\nAfter a brief talk with his mother, he started for the castle, as his\nappearance there would divert any suspicion that might arise; and it\nwould also appear natural that seeing the movements of so large a body of\nmen, he should go up to gossip with his acquaintances there.\n\nWhen distant a mile from Evesham, he came upon a small party.\n\nOn a white palfrey rode Margaret, the little daughter of the earl. She\nwas accompanied by her nurse and two retainers on foot.\n\nCuthbert--who was a great favourite with the earl's daughter, for whom\nhe frequently brought pets, such as nests of young owlets, falcons, and\nother creatures--was about to join the party when from a clump of trees\nnear burst a body of ten mounted men.\n\nWithout a word they rode straight at the astonished group. The\nretainers were cut to the ground before they had thought of drawing a\nsword in defence.\n\nThe nurse was slain by a blow with a battle-axe, and Margaret, snatched\nfrom her palfrey, was thrown across the saddle-bow of one of the mounted\nmen, who then with his comrades dashed off at full speed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A RESCUE.\n\n\nThe whole of the startling scene of the abduction of the Earl of\nEvesham's daughter occupied but a few seconds. Cuthbert was so astounded\nat the sudden calamity that he remained rooted to the ground at the spot\nwhere, fortunately for himself, unnoticed by the assailants, he had stood\nwhen they first burst from their concealment.\n\nFor a short time he hesitated as to the course he should take.\n\nThe men-at-arms who remained in the castle were scarce strong enough to\nrescue the child, whose captors would no doubt be reinforced by a far\nstronger party lurking near.\n\nThe main body of Sir Walter's followers were deep in the recesses of the\nforest, and this lay altogether out of the line for Wortham, and there\nwould be no chance whatever of bringing them up in time to cut off the\nmarauders on their way back.\n\nThere remained only the outlaws, who by this time would be in Langholm\nForest, perhaps within a mile or two of the castle itself.\n\nThe road by which the horsemen would travel would be far longer than the\ndirect line across country, and he resolved at once to strain every nerve\nto reach his friends in time to get them to interpose between the captors\nof the Lady Margaret and their stronghold.\n\nFor an instant he hesitated whether to run back to Erstwood to get a\nhorse; but he decided that it would be as quick to go on foot, and far\neasier so to find the outlaws.\n\nThese thoughts occupied but a few moments, and he at once started at the\ntop of his speed for his long run across the country.\n\nHad Cuthbert been running in a race of hare and hound, he would assuredly\nhave borne away the prize from most boys of his age. At headlong pace he\nmade across the country, every foot of which, as far as the edge of\nLangholm Chase, he knew by heart.\n\nThe distance to the woods was some twelve miles, and in an hour and a\nhalf from the moment of his starting Cuthbert was deep within its shades.\nWhere he would be likely to find the outlaws he knew not; and, putting a\nwhistle to his lips, he shrilly blew the signal, which would, he knew, be\nrecognized by any of the band within hearing.\n\nHe thought that he heard an answer, but was not certain, and again dashed\nforward, almost as speedily as if he had but just started.\n\nFive minutes later a man stood in the glade up which he was running. He\nrecognized him at once as one of Cnut's party.\n\n\"Where are the band?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Half a mile or so to the right,\" replied the man.\n\nGuided by the man, Cuthbert ran at full speed, till, panting and scarce\nable to speak, he arrived at the spot where Cnut's band were gathered.\n\nIn a few words he told them what had happened, and although they had just\nbeen chased by the father of the captured child, there was not a moment\nof hesitation in promising their aid to rescue her from a man whom they\nregarded as a far more bitter enemy, both of themselves and their race.\n\n\"I fear we shall be too late to cut them off,\" Cnut said, \"they have so\nlong a start; but at least we will waste no time in gossiping.\"\n\nWinding a horn to call together some of the members of the band who had\nscattered, and leaving one at the meeting-place to give instructions to\nthe rest, Cnut, followed by those assembled there, went off at a swinging\ntrot through the glades towards Wortham Castle.\n\nAfter a rapid calculation of distances, and allowing for the fact that\nthe baron's men--knowing that Sir Walter's retainers and friends were all\ndeep in the forest, and even if they heard of the outrage could not be on\ntheir traces for hours--would take matters quietly, Cnut concluded that\nthey had arrived in time.\n\nTurning off, they made their way along the edge of the wood to the point\nwhere the road from Evesham ran through the forest.\n\nScarcely had the party reached this point when they heard a faint\nclatter of steel.\n\n\"Here they come!\" exclaimed Cuthbert.\n\nCnut gave rapid directions, and the band took up their posts behind the\ntrees, on either side of the path.\n\n\"Remember,\" Cnut said, \"above all things be careful not to hit the child,\nbut pierce the horse on which she is riding. The instant he falls, rush\nforward. We must trust to surprise to give us the victory.\"\n\nThree minutes later the head of a band of horsemen was seen through the\ntrees. They were some thirty in number, and, closely grouped as they were\ntogether, the watchers behind the trees could not see the form of the\nchild carried in their midst.\n\nWhen they came abreast of the concealed outlaws, Cnut gave a sharp\nwhistle, and fifty arrows flew from tree and bush into the closely\ngathered party of horsemen. More than half their number fell at once;\nsome, drawing their swords, endeavoured to rush at their concealed foes,\nwhile others dashed forward in the hope of riding through the snare into\nwhich they had fallen. Cuthbert had levelled his crossbow, but had not\nfired; he was watching with intense anxiety for a glimpse of the\nbright-coloured dress of the child. Soon he saw a horseman separate\nhimself from the rest and dash forward at full speed. Several arrows flew\nby him, and one or two struck the horse on which he rode.\n\nThe animal, however, kept on its way.\n\nCuthbert levelled his crossbow on the low arm of a tree, and as the rider\ncame abreast of him touched the trigger, and the steel-pointed quarrel\nflew true and strong against the temple of the passing horseman. He fell\nfrom his horse like a stone and the well-trained animal at once stood\nstill by the side of his rider.\n\nCuthbert leapt forward, and to his delight the child at once opened her\narms and cried in a joyous tone,--\n\n\"Cuthbert!\"\n\nThe fight was still raging fiercely, and Cuthbert, raising her from the\nground, ran with her into the wood, where they remained hidden until the\ncombat ceased, and the last survivors of the Baron's band had ridden past\ntowards the castle.\n\nThen Cuthbert went forward with his charge and joined the band of\noutlaws, who, absorbed in the fight, had not witnessed the incident of\nher rescue, and now received them with loud shouts of joy and triumph.\n\n\"This is a good day's work indeed for all,\" Cuthbert said; \"it will make\nof the earl a firm friend instead of a bitter enemy; and I doubt not that\nbetter days are dawning for Evesham Forest.\"\n\nA litter was speedily made with boughs, on this Margaret was placed, and\non the shoulders of two stout foresters started for home, Cnut and\nCuthbert walking beside, and a few of the band keeping at a short\ndistance behind, as a sort of rear-guard should the Baron attempt to\nregain his prey.\n\nThere was now no cause for speed, and Cuthbert in truth could scarce drag\none foot before another, for he had already traversed over twenty miles,\nthe greater portion of the distance at his highest rate of speed.\n\nCnut offered to have a litter made for him also, but this Cuthbert\nindignantly refused; however, in the forest they came upon the hut of a\nsmall cultivator, who had a rough forest pony, which was borrowed for\nCuthbert's use.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon before they came in sight of Evesham Castle.\nFrom the distance could be seen bodies of armed men galloping towards it,\nand it was clear that only now the party were returning from the wood,\nand had learned the news of the disappearance of the Earl's daughter, and\nof the finding of the bodies of her attendants.\n\nPresently they met one of the mounted retainers riding at headlong speed.\n\n\"Have you heard or seen anything,\" he shouted, as he approached, \"of the\nLady Margaret? She is missing, and foul play has taken place.\"\n\n\"Here I am, Rudolph,\" cried the child, sitting up on the rude litter.\n\nThe horseman gave a cry of astonishment and pleasure, and without a\nword wheeled his horse and galloped past back at headlong speed towards\nthe castle.\n\nAs Cuthbert and the party approached the gate, the earl himself,\nsurrounded by his knights and followers, rode out hastily from the\ngate and halted in front of the little party. The litter was lowered,\nand as he dismounted from his horse his daughter sprang out and leapt\ninto his arms.\n\nFor a few minutes the confusion and babble of tongues were too great for\nanything to be heard, but Cuthbert, as soon as order was somewhat\nrestored, stated what had happened, and the earl was moved to fury at the\nnews of the outrage which had been perpetrated by the Baron of Wortham\nupon his daughter and at the very gates of his castle, and also at the\nthought that she should have been saved by the bravery and devotion of\nthe very men against whom he had so lately been vowing vengeance in the\ndepths of the forest.\n\n\"This is not a time,\" he said to Cnut, \"for talking or making promises,\nbut be assured that henceforth the deer of Evesham Chase are as free to\nyou and your men as to me. Forest laws or no forest laws, I will no more\nlift a hand against men to whom I owe so much. Come when you will to the\ncastle, my friends, and let us talk over what can be done to erase your\noutlawry and restore you to an honest career again.\"\n\nCuthbert returned home tired, but delighted with his day's work, and Dame\nEditha was surprised indeed with the tale of adventure he had to tell.\nThe next morning he went over to the castle, and heard that a grand\ncouncil had been held the evening before, and that it had been determined\nto attack Wortham Castle and to raze it to the ground.\n\nImmediately on hearing of his arrival, the earl, after again expressing\nhis gratitude for the rescue of his daughter, asked him if he would go\ninto the forest and invite the outlaws to join their forces with those of\nthe castle to attack the baron.\n\nCuthbert willingly undertook the mission, as he felt that this alliance\nwould further strengthen the position of the forest men.\n\nWhen he arrived there was some considerable consultation and discussion\nbetween the outlaws as to the expediency of mixing themselves in the\nquarrels between the Norman barons. However, Cnut persuaded them that as\nthe Baron of Wortham was an enemy and oppressor of all Saxons, it was in\nfact their own quarrel that they were fighting rather than that of the\nearl, and they therefore agreed to give their aid, and promised to be at\nthe rendezvous outside the castle to be attacked, soon after dawn next\nmorning. Cuthbert returned with the news, which gave great satisfaction\nto the earl.\n\nThe castle was now a scene of bustle and business; armourers were at work\nrepairing head-pieces and breastplates, sharpening swords and\nbattle-axes, while the fletchers prepared sheaves of arrows. In the\ncourtyard a number of men were engaged oiling the catapults, ballistas,\nand other machines for hurling stones. All were discussing the chances of\nthe assault, for it was no easy matter which they had set themselves to\ndo. Wortham Hold was an extremely strong one, and it needed all and more\nthan all the machines at their disposal to undertake so formidable an\noperation as a siege.\n\nThe garrison, too, were strong and desperate; and the baron, knowing what\nmust follow his outrage of the day before, would have been sure to send\noff messengers round the country begging his friends to come to his\nassistance. Cuthbert had begged permission of his mother to ask the earl\nto allow him to join as a volunteer, but she would not hear of it.\nNeither would she suffer him to mingle with the foresters. The utmost\nthat he could obtain was that he might go as a spectator, with strict\ninjunctions to keep himself out of the fray, and as far as possible\nbeyond bow-shot of the castle wall.\n\nIt was a force of some 400 strong that issued from the wood early next\nmorning to attack the stronghold at Wortham. The force consisted of some\nten or twelve knights and barons, some 150 or 160 Norman men-at-arms, a\nmiscellaneous gathering of other retainers, 200 strong, and some eighty\nof the forest men. These last were not to fight under the earl's banner,\nbut were to act on their own account. There were among them outlaws,\nescaped serfs, and some men guilty of bloodshed. The earl then could not\nhave suffered these men to fight under his flag until purged in some way\nof their offences.\n\nThis arrangement suited the foresters well.\n\nTheir strong point was shooting; and by taking up their own position, and\nfollowing their own tactics, under the leadership of Cnut, they would be\nable to do far more execution, and that with less risk to themselves,\nthan if compelled to fight according to the fashion of the Normans.\n\nAs they approached the castle a trumpet was blown, and the herald,\nadvancing, demanded its surrender, stigmatized the Baron of Wortham as a\nfalse knight and a disgrace to his class, and warned all those within\nthe castle to abstain from giving him aid or countenance, but to submit\nthemselves to the earl, Sir Walter of Evesham, the representative of\nKing Richard.\n\nThe reply to the summons was a burst of taunting laughter from the walls;\nand scarcely had the herald withdrawn, than a flight of arrows showed\nthat the besieged were perfectly ready for the fray.\n\nIndeed, the baron had not been idle. Already the dispute between himself\nand the earl had come to such a point that it was certain that sooner or\nlater open hostilities would break out.\n\nHe had therefore been for some time quietly accumulating a large store\nof provisions and munitions of war, and strengthening the castle in\nevery way.\n\nThe moat had been cleaned out, and filled to the brim with water. Great\nquantities of heavy stones had been accumulated on the most exposed\npoints of the walls, in readiness to hurl upon any who might try to\nclimb. Huge sheaves of arrows and piles of crossbow bolts, were in\nreadiness, and in all, save the number of men, Wortham had for weeks been\nprepared for the siege.\n\nOn the day when the attempt to carry off the earl's daughter had failed,\nthe baron, seeing that his bold stroke to obtain a hostage which would\nhave enabled him to make his own terms with the earl, had been thwarted,\nknew that the struggle was inevitable.\n\nFleet messengers had been sent in all directions. To Gloucester and\nHereford, Stafford, and even Oxford, men had ridden, with letters to the\nbaron's friends, beseeching them to march to his assistance.\n\n\"I can,\" he said, \"defend my hold for weeks. But it is only by aid\nfrom without that I can finally hope to break the power of this\nbraggart earl.\"\n\nMany of those to whom he addressed his call had speedily complied with\nhis demand, while those at a distance might be expected to reply later to\nthe appeal.\n\nThere were many among the barons who considered the mildness of the Earl\nof Evesham towards the Saxons in his district to be a mistake, and who,\nalthough not actually approving of the tyranny and brutality of the Baron\nof Wortham, yet looked upon his cause to some extent as their own.\n\nThe Castle of Wortham stood upon ground but very slightly elevated above\nthe surrounding country. A deep and wide moat ran round it, and this\ncould, by diverting a rivulet, be filled at will.\n\nFrom the edge of the moat the walls rose high, and with strong flanking\ntowers and battlements.\n\nThere were strong works also beyond the moat opposite to the drawbridge;\nwhile in the centre of the castle rose the keep, from whose summit the\narchers, and the machines for casting stones and darts, could command\nthe whole circuit of defence.\n\nAs Cuthbert, accompanied by one of the hinds of the farm, took his post\nhigh up in a lofty tree, where at his ease he could command a view of the\nproceedings, he marvelled much in what manner an attack upon so fair a\nfortress would be commenced.\n\n\"It will be straightforward work to attack the outwork,\" he said, \"but\nthat once won, I see not how we are to proceed against the castle itself.\nThe machines that the earl has will scarcely hurl stones strong enough\neven to knock the mortar from the walls. Ladders are useless where they\ncannot be planted; and if the garrison are as brave as the castle is\nstrong, methinks that the earl has embarked upon a business that will\nkeep him here till next spring.\"\n\nThere was little time lost in commencing the conflict.\n\nThe foresters, skirmishing up near to the castle, and taking advantage\nof every inequality in the ground, of every bush and tuft of high grass,\nworked up close to the moat, and then opened a heavy fire with their\nbows against the men-at-arms on the battlements, and prevented their\nusing the machines against the main force now advancing to the attack\nupon the outwork.\n\nThis was stoutly defended. But the impetuosity of the earl, backed as it\nwas by the gallantry of the knights serving under him, carried all\nobstacles.\n\nThe narrow moat which encircled this work was speedily filled with great\nbundles of brushwood, which had been prepared the previous night. Across\nthese the assailants rushed.\n\nSome thundered at the gate with their battle-axes, while others placed\nladders by which, although several times hurled backwards by the\ndefenders, they finally succeeded in getting a footing on the wall.\n\nOnce there, the combat was virtually over.\n\nThe defenders were either cut down or taken prisoners, and in two hours\nafter the assault began, the outwork of Wortham Castle was taken.\n\nThis, however, was but the commencement of the undertaking, and it had\ncost more than twenty lives to the assailants.\n\nThey were now, indeed, little nearer to capturing the castle than they\nhad been before.\n\nThe moat was wide and deep. The drawbridge had been lifted at the instant\nthat the first of the assailants gained a footing upon the wall. And now\nthat the outwork was captured, a storm of arrows, stones, and other\nmissiles was poured into it from the castle walls, and rendered it\nimpossible for any of its new masters, to show themselves above it.\n\nSeeing that any sudden attack was impossible, the earl now directed a\nstrong body to cut down trees, and prepare a movable bridge to throw\nacross the moat.\n\nThis would be a work of fully two days; and in the meantime Cuthbert\nreturned to the farm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE CAPTURE OF WORTHAM HOLD.\n\n\nUpon his return home, after relating to his mother the events of the\nmorning's conflict, Cuthbert took his way to the cottage inhabited by an\nold man who had in his youth been a mason.\n\n\"Have I not heard, Gurth,\" he said, \"that you helped to build the Castle\nof Wortham?\"\n\n\"No, no, young sir,\" he said; \"old as I am, I was a child when the\ncastle was built. My father worked at it, and it cost him, and many\nothers, his life.\"\n\n\"And how was that, prithee?\" asked Cuthbert.\n\n\"He was, with several others, killed by the baron, the grandfather of the\npresent man, when the work was finished.\"\n\n\"But why was that, Gurth?\"\n\n\"We were but Saxon swine,\" said Gurth bitterly, \"and a few of us more or\nless mattered not. We were then serfs of the baron. But my mother fled\nwith me on the news of my father's death. For years we remained far away,\nwith some friends in a forest near Oxford. Then she pined for her native\nair, and came back and entered the service of the franklin.\"\n\n\"But why should your mother have taken you away?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"She always believed, Master Cuthbert, that my father was killed by the\nbaron, to prevent him giving any news of the secrets of the castle. He\nand some others had been kept in the walls for many months, and were\nengaged in the making of secret passages.\"\n\n\"That is just what I came to ask you, Gurth. I have heard something of\nthis story before, and now that we are attacking Wortham Castle, and the\nearl has sworn to level it to the ground, it is of importance if possible\nto find out whether any of the secret passages lead beyond the castle,\nand if so, where. Almost all the castles have, I have been told, an exit\nby which the garrison can at will make sorties or escape; and I thought\nthat maybe you might have heard enough to give us some clue as to the\nexistence of such a passage at Wortham.\"\n\nThe old man thought for some time in silence, and then said,--\n\n\"I may be mistaken, but methinks a diligent search in the copse near the\nstream might find the mouth of the outlet.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that this is so, Gurth?\"\n\n\"I had been with my mother to carry some clothes to my father on the last\noccasion on which I saw him. As we neared the castle I saw my father and\nthree other of the workmen, together with the baron, coming down from the\ncastle towards the spot. As my mother did not wish to approach while the\nbaron was at hand, we stood within the trees at the edge of the wood, and\nwatched what was being done. The baron came with them down to the bushes,\nand then they again came out, crossed the river, and one of them cut some\nwillows, peeled them, and erected the white staves in a line towards the\ncastle. They walked for a bit on each side, and seemed to be making\ncalculations. Then they went back into the castle, and I never saw my\nfather again.\"\n\n\"Why did you not go in at once according to your intention?\"\n\n\"Because my mother said that she thought some important work was on\nhand, and that maybe the baron would not like that women should know\naught of it, for he was of suspicious and evil mind. More than this I\nknow not. The castle had already been finished, and most of the masons\ndischarged. There were, however, a party of serfs kept at work, and also\nsome masons, and rumour had it that they were engaged in making the\nsecret passages. Whether it was so or not I cannot say, but I know that\nnone of that party ever left the castle alive. It was given out that a\nbad fever had raged there, but none believed it; and the report went\nabout, and was I doubt not true, that all had been killed, to preserve\nthe secret of the passage.\"\n\nCuthbert lost no time in making use of the information that he had\ngained.\n\nEarly next morning, at daybreak, he started on his pony to Wortham.\n\nAs he did not wish the earl or his followers to know the facts that\nhe had learned until they were proved, he made his way round the camp\nof the besiegers, and by means of his whistle called one of the\nforesters to him.\n\n\"Where is Cnut?\" he asked.\n\n\"He is with a party occupied in making ladders.\"\n\n\"Go to him,\" Cuthbert said, \"and tell him to withdraw quietly and\nmake his way here. I have an important matter on which I wish to\nspeak to him,'\"\n\nCnut arrived in a few minutes, somewhat wondering at the message. He\nbrightened greatly when Cuthbert told him what he had learned.\n\n\"This is indeed important,\" he said. \"We will lose no time in searching\nthe copse you speak of. You and I, together with two of my most trusty\nmen, with axes to clear away the brush, will do. At present a thing of\nthis sort had best be kept between as few as may be.\"\n\nThey started at once and soon came down upon the stream.\n\nIt ran at this point in a little valley, some twenty or thirty feet deep.\nOn the bank not far from the castle grew a small wood, and it was in this\nthat Cuthbert hoped to find the passage spoken of by Gurth.\n\nThe trees and brushwood were so thick that it was apparent at once that\nif the passage had ever existed it had been unused for some years.\n\nThe woodmen were obliged to chop down dozens of young saplings to make\ntheir way up from the water towards the steeper part of the bank.\n\nThe wood was some fifty yards in length, and as it was uncertain at which\npoint the passage had come out, a very minute search had to be made.\n\n\"What do you think it would be like, Cnut?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"Like enough to a rabbit-hole, or more likely still there would be no\nhole whatever. We must look for moss and greenery, for it is likely that\nsuch would have been planted, so as to conceal the door from any\npasser-by, while yet allowing a party from inside to cut their way\nthrough it without difficulty.\"\n\nAfter a search of two hours, Cnut decided that the only place in the\ncopse in which it was likely that the entrance to a passage could be\nhidden, was a spot where the ground was covered thickly with ivy and\ntrailing plants.\n\n\"It looks level enough with the rest,\" Cuthbert said.\n\n\"Ay, lad, but we know not what lies behind this thick screen of ivy.\nThrust in that staff.\"\n\nOne of the woodmen began to probe with the end of a staff among the ivy.\nFor some time he was met by the solid ground, but presently the butt of\nthe staff went through suddenly, pitching him on his head, amidst a\nsuppressed laugh from his comrades.\n\n\"Here it is, if anywhere,\" said Cnut, and with their billhooks they at\nonce began to clear away the thickly grown creepers.\n\nFive minutes' work was sufficient to show a narrow cut, some two feet\nwide, in the hill side, at the end of which stood a low door.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Cnut, with triumph, \"and the castle is ours. Thanks,\nCuthbert, for your thought and intelligence. It has not been used lately,\nthat is clear,\" he went on. \"These creepers have not been moved for\nyears. Shall we go and tell the earl of our discovery? What think you,\nCuthbert?\"\n\n\"I think we had better not,\" Cuthbert said. \"We might not succeed in\ngetting in, as the passage may have fallen farther along; but I will\nspeak to him and tell him that we have something on hand which may alter\nhis dispositions for fighting to-morrow.\"\n\nCuthbert made his way to the earl, who had taken possession of a small\ncottage a short distance from the castle.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" Sir Walter said.\n\n\"I want to ask you, sir, not to attack the castle to-morrow until you see\na white flag waved from the keep.\"\n\n\"But how on earth is a white flag to be raised from the keep?\"\n\n\"It may be,\" Cuthbert said, \"that I have some friends inside who will be\nable to make a diversion in our favour. However sir, it can do no harm\nif you will wait till then, and may save many lives. At what hour do you\nmean to attack?\"\n\n\"The bridges and all other preparations to assist us across the moat will\nbe ready to-night. We will advance then under cover of darkness, and as\nsoon after dawn as may be attack in earnest.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" Cuthbert said. \"I trust that within five minutes after\nyour bugle has sounded, the white flag will make its appearance on the\nkeep, but it cannot do so until after you have commenced an attack, or at\nleast a pretence of an attack.\"\n\nTwo or three hours before daylight Cuthbert accompanied Cnut and\ntwenty-five picked men of the foresters to the copse. They were provided\nwith crowbars, and all carried heavy axes. The door was soon prised open.\nIt opened silently and without a creak.\n\n\"It may be,\" Cnut said, \"that the door has not been opened as you say for\nyears, but it is certain,\" and he placed his torch to the hinges, \"that\nit has been well oiled within the last two or three days. No doubt the\nbaron intended to make his escape this way, should the worst arrive. Now\nthat we have the door open we had better wait quiet until the dawn\ncommences. The earl will blow his bugle as a signal for the advance; it\nwill be another ten minutes before they are fairly engaged, and that will\nbe enough for us to break open any doors that there may be between this\nand the castle, and to force our way inside.\"\n\nIt seemed a long time waiting before the dawn fairly broke--still longer\nbefore the earl's bugle was heard to sound the attack. Then the band,\nheaded by Cnut and two or three of the strongest of the party, entered\nthe passage.\n\nCuthbert had had some misgivings as to his mother's injunctions to take\nno part in the fray, and it cannot be said that in accompanying the\nforesters he obeyed the letter of her instructions. At the same time as\nhe felt sure that the effect of a surprise would be complete and\ncrushing, and that the party would gain the top of the keep without any\nserious resistance, he considered the risk was so small as to justify\nhim in accompanying the foresters.\n\nThe passage was some five feet high, and little more than two feet wide.\nIt was dry and dusty, and save the marks on the ground of a human foot\ngoing and returning, doubtless that of the man who had oiled the lock the\nday before, the passage appeared to have been unused from the time that\nit left the hands of its builders.\n\nPassing along for some distance they came to another strong oaken\ndoor. This, like the last, yielded to the efforts of the crowbars of\nthe foresters, and they again advanced. Presently they came to a\nflight of steps.\n\n\"We must now be near the castle,\" Cnut said. \"In fact, methinks I can\nhear confused noises ahead.\"\n\nMounting the steps, they came to a third door; this was thickly studded\nwith iron, and appeared of very great strength. Fortunately the lock was\nupon their side, and they were enabled to shoot the bolt; but upon the\nother side the door was firmly secured by large bolts, and it was fully\nfive minutes before the foresters could succeed in opening it. It was\nnot without a good deal of noise that they at last did so; and several\ntimes they paused, fearing that the alarm must have been given in the\ncastle. As, however, the door remained closed, they supposed that the\noccupants were fully engaged in defending themselves from the attacks of\nthe earl's party.\n\nWhen the door gave way, they found hanging across in front of them a very\nthick arras, and pressing this aside they entered a small room in the\nthickness of the wall of the keep. It contained the merest slit for\nlight, and was clearly unused. Another door, this time unfastened, led\ninto a larger apartment, which was also at present unoccupied. They could\nhear now the shouts of the combatants without, the loud orders given by\nthe leaders on the walls, the crack, as the stones hurled by the\nmangonels struck the walls, and the ring of steel as the arrows struck\nagainst steel cap and cuirass.\n\n\"It is fortunate that all were so well engaged, or they would certainly\nhave heard the noise of our forcing the door, which would have brought\nall of them upon us. As it is, we are in the heart of the keep. We have\nnow but to make a rush up these winding steps, and methinks we shall find\nourselves on the battlements. They will be so surprised, that no real\nresistance can be offered to us. Now let us advance.\"\n\nSo saying Cnut led the way upstairs, followed by the foresters, Cuthbert,\nas before, allowing five or six of them to intervene between him and the\nleader. He carried his short sword and a quarterstaff, a weapon by no\nmeans to be despised in the hands of an active and experienced player.\n\nPresently, after mounting some fifty or sixty steps, they issued on the\nplatform of the keep.\n\nHere were gathered some thirty or forty men, who were so busied in\nshooting with crossbows, and in working machines casting javelins,\nstones, and other missives upon the besiegers, that they were unaware of\nthe addition to their numbers until the whole of the foresters had\ngathered on the summit, and at the order of Cnut suddenly fell upon them\nwith a loud shout.\n\nTaken wholly by surprise by the foe, who seemed to have risen from the\nbowels of the earth by magic, the soldiers of the Baron of Wortham\noffered but a feeble resistance. Some were cast over the battlement of\nthe keep, some driven down staircases, others cut down, and then\nCuthbert, fastening a small white flag he had prepared to his\nquarter-staff, waved it above the battlements.\n\nEven now the combatants on the outer wall were in ignorance of what had\nhappened in the keep; so great was the din that the struggle which had\nthere taken place had passed unnoticed; and it was not until the\nfugitives, rushing out into the courtyard, shouted that the keep had been\ncaptured, that the besieged became aware of the imminence of the danger.\n\nHitherto the battle had been going well for the defenders of the castle.\nThe Baron of Wortham was indeed surprised at the feebleness of the\nassault. The arrows which had fallen in clouds upon the first day's\nattack upon the castle among his soldiers were now comparatively few and\nineffective. The besiegers scarcely appeared to push forward their\nbridges with any vigour, and it seemed to him that a coldness had fallen\nupon them, and that some disagreement must have arisen between the\nforesters and the earl, completely crippling the energy of the attack.\n\nWhen he heard the words shouted from the courtyard below he could not\nbelieve his ears. That the keep behind should have been carried by the\nenemy appeared to him impossible. With a roar he called upon the bravest\nof his men to follow, and rushing across the courtyard, rapidly ascended\nthe staircase. The movement was observed from the keep, and Cnut and a\nfew of his men, stationed themselves with their battle-axes at the top of\nvarious stairs leading below.\n\nThe signal shown by Cuthbert had not passed unobserved. The earl, who had\ngiven instructions to his followers to make a mere feint of attacking,\nnow blew the signal for the real onslaught. The bridges were rapidly run\nacross the moat, ladders were planted, and the garrison being paralyzed\nand confused by the attack in their rear, as well as hindered by the\narrows which now flew down upon them from the keep above, offered but a\nfeeble resistance, and the assailants, led by Sir Walter himself, poured\nover the walls.\n\nNow there was a scene of confusion and desperate strife. The baron had\njust gained the top of the stairs, and was engaged in a fierce conflict\nwith Cnut and his men, when the news reached him that the wall was\ncarried from without. With an execration he again turned and rushed down\nthe stairs, hoping by a vigorous effort to cast back the foe.\n\nIt was, however, all too late: his followers, disheartened and alarmed,\nfought without method or order in scattered groups of threes and fours.\nThey made their last stand in corners and passages. They knew there was\nbut little hope of mercy from the Saxon foresters, and against these they\nfought to the last. To the Norman retainers, however, of the earl they\noffered a less determined resistance, throwing down their arms and\nsurrendering at discretion.\n\nThe baron, when fiercely fighting, was slain by an arrow from the keep\nabove, and with his fall the last resistance ceased. A short time was\nspent in searching the castle, binding the prisoners, and carrying off\nthe valuables that the baron had collected in his raids. Then a light was\nset to the timbers, the granaries were fired, and in a few minutes the\nsmoke wreathing out of the various loopholes and openings told the\ncountry round that the stronghold had fallen, and that they were free\nfrom the oppressor at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE CRUSADES.\n\n\nWarm thanks and much praise were bestowed upon Cuthbert for his share in\nthe capture of the castle, and the earl, calling the foresters round him,\nthen and there bestowed freedom upon any of them who might have been\nserfs of his, and called upon all his knights and neighbours to do the\nsame, in return for the good service which they had rendered.\n\nThis was willingly done, and a number of Cnut's party who had before\nborne the stigma of escaped serfs were now free men.\n\nWe are too apt to forget, in our sympathy with the Saxons, that fond as\nthey were of freedom for themselves, they were yet severe masters, and\nkept the mass of the people in a state of serfage. Although their laws\nprovided ample justice as between Saxon man and man, there was no justice\nfor the unhappy serfs, who were either the original inhabitants or\ncaptives taken in war, and who were distinguished by a collar of brass or\niron round their neck.\n\nCnut's party had indeed long got rid of these badges, the first act of a\nserf when he took to the woods being always to file off his collar; but\nthey were liable when caught to be punished, even by death, and were\ndelighted at having achieved their freedom.\n\n\"And what can I do for you, Cuthbert?\" Sir Walter said, as they rode\nhomewards. \"It is to you that I am indebted: in the first place for the\nrescue of my daughter, in the second for the capture of that castle,\nwhich I doubt me much whether we should ever have taken in fair fight had\nit not been for your aid.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Sir Walter,\" the lad replied. \"At present I need nothing, but\nshould the time come when you may go to the wars, I would fain ride\nwith you as your page, in the hope of some day winning my spurs also in\nthe field.\"\n\n\"So shall it be,\" the earl said, \"and right willingly. But who\nhave we here?\"\n\nAs he spoke a horseman rode up and presented a paper to the earl.\n\n\"This is a notice,\" the earl said, after perusing it, \"that King Richard\nhas determined to take up the cross, and that he calls upon his nobles\nand barons to join him in the effort to free the holy sepulchre from the\ninfidels. I doubt whether the minds of the people are quite prepared, but\nI hear that there has been much preaching by friars and monks in some\nparts, and that many are eager to join in the war.\"\n\n\"Think you that you will go to the war, Sir Walter?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"I know not as yet; it must much depend upon the king's mood. For\nmyself, I care not so greatly as some do about this question of the Holy\nLand. There has been blood enough shed already to drown it, and we are no\nnearer than when the first swarms of pilgrims made their way thither.\"\n\nOn Cuthbert's returning home and telling his mother all that had passed,\nshe shook her head, but said that she could not oppose his wishes to go\nwith the earl when the time should come, and that it was only right he\nshould follow in the footsteps of the good knight his father.\n\n\"I have heard much of these Crusades,\" he said; \"canst tell me\nabout them?\"\n\n\"In truth I know not much, my son; but Father Francis, I doubt not, can\ntell you all the particulars anent the affair.\"\n\nThe next time that Father Francis, who was the special adviser of Dame\nEditha, rode over from the convent on his ambling nag, Cuthbert eagerly\nasked him if he would tell him what he knew of the Crusades.\n\n\"Hitherto, my son,\" he said, \"the Crusades have, it must be owned,\nbrought many woes upon Europe. From the early times great swarms\nof pilgrims were accustomed to go from all parts of Europe to the\nholy shrines.\n\n\"When the followers of the evil prophet took possession of the land, they\nlaid grievous burdens upon the pilgrims, heavily they fined them,\npersecuted them in every way, and treated them as if indeed they were but\nthe scum of the earth under their feet.\n\n\"So terrible were the tales that reached Europe that men came to think\nthat it would be a good deed truly, to wrest the sepulchre of the Lord\nfrom the hands of these heathens. Pope Urban was the first to give\nauthority and strength to the movement, and at a vast meeting at\nClaremont of 30,000 clergy and 4000 barons, it was decided that war must\nbe made against the infidel. From all parts of France men flocked to\nhear Pope Urban preach there; and when he had finished his oration, the\nvast multitude, carried away by enthusiasm, swore to win the holy\nsepulchre or to die.\n\n\"Mighty was the throng that gathered for the First Crusade. Monks threw\naside their gowns and took to the sword and cuirass; even women and\nchildren joined in the throng. What, my son, could be expected from a\ngreat army so formed? Without leaders, without discipline, without\ntactics, without means of getting food, they soon became a scourge of the\ncountry through which they passed.\n\n\"Passing through Hungary, where they greatly ravaged the fields, they\ncame to Bulgaria. Here the people, struck with astonishment and dismay at\nthis great horde of hungry people who arrived among them like locusts,\nfell upon them with the sword, and great numbers fell. The first band\nthat passed into that country perished miserably, and of all that huge\nassembly, it may be said that, numbering, at the start, not less than\n250,000 persons, only about 100,000 crossed into Asia Minor. The fate of\nthese was no better than that of those who had perished in Hungary and\nBulgaria. After grievous suffering and loss they at last reached Nicaea.\nThere they fell into an ambuscade; and out of the whole of the\nundisciplined masses who had followed Peter the Hermit, it is doubtful\nwhether 10,000 ever returned home.\n\n\"This first attempt to rescue the holy sepulchre was followed by others\nequally wild, misguided, and unfortunate. Some of them indeed began their\nevil deeds as soon as they had left their home. The last of these bodies\nfell upon the Jews, who are indeed enemies of the Christian faith, but\nwho have now, at least, nothing to do with the question of the holy\nsepulchre. As soon as they entered into Germany the Crusaders put them to\ndeath with horrible torture. Plunder and rapine indeed appeared to be the\nobject of the crusaders. On this as well as on most other preceding\nbands, their misdeeds drew down the vengeance of the people. At an early\nperiod of their march, and as soon as they reached Hungary, the people\nfell upon them, and put the greater portion to the sword.\n\n\"Thus, in these irregular expeditions no less than 500,000 people are\nsupposed to have perished. Godfrey de Bouillon was the first who\nundertook to lead a Crusade according to the military knowledge of the\nday. With him were his brothers Eustace and Baldwin, the Counts of Anault\nand St. Paul, and many other nobles and gentlemen, with their retainers,\nwell armed and under good order; and so firm was the discipline of Duke\nGodfrey that they were allowed to pass freely, by the people of the\ncountries who had opposed the previous bands.\n\n\"Through Hungary, Bulgaria, and Thrace he made his way; and though he\nmet with many difficulties from Alexius, the crafty and treacherous\nEmperor of the Greeks, he at last succeeded in crossing into Asia.\nThere he was joined by many from England, as well as from France and\nother countries. Duke Robert, the son of our first William, led a\nstrong band of Normans to the war, as did the other great princes of\nFrance and Spain.\n\n\"The army which crossed the narrow passage of the Hellespont is estimated\nat no less than 700,000 fighting men. Of these 100,000 were knights clad\nin complete armour, the remainder were men-at-arms and bowmen.\n\n\"Nicaea, the place which had been the scene of the massacre of Peter the\nHermit's hosts, was taken after a desperate conflict, lasting for many\nweeks, and the crusaders afterwards defeated the Turks in a great battle\nnear the town of Doryleum. After these successes disputes arose among the\nleaders, and Count Baldwin, brother of Duke Godfrey, left the main body\nwith about 1500 men, and founded a kingdom for himself in Mesopotamia.\n\n\"The main body, slowly and painfully, and suffering from disease, famine,\nand the heat, made its way south. Antioch, a city of great strength and\nimportance, was besieged, but it proved so strong that it resisted for\nmany months, and was at last only taken by treachery.\n\n\"After the capture of this place the sufferings of the crusaders so far\nfrom being diminished were redoubled. They themselves during the siege\nhad bought up all the food that could be brought from the surrounding\ncountry, while the magazines of the town were found, when an entry was\neffected, to be entirely deserted. The enemy, aided by a great Persian\nhost, came down, and those who had been the besiegers were now besieged.\nHowever, when in the last strait the Christian army sallied out, and\ninspired with supernatural strength, defeated the Turks and Persians,\nwith a slaughter of 100,000 men. Another slow movement to the south\nbrought them into the Holy Land, and pressing forward, they came at last\nwithin sight of Jerusalem itself.\n\n\"So fearful had been the losses of the crusaders that of 700,000 who\ncrossed the Hellespont, not more than 40,000 reached the end of the\npilgrimage. This fragment of an army, which had appeared before a very\nstrongly fortified town, possessed no means of capturing the place--none\nof the machines of war necessary for the purpose, no provisions or\nmunitions of any kind. Water was scarce also; and it appeared as if the\nremnant of the great army of Godfrey de Bouillon had arrived before\nJerusalem only to perish there.\n\n\"Happily just at this time a further band of crusaders from Genoa, who\nhad reached Jaffa, made their appearance. They were provided with stores,\nand had skilled workmen capable of making the machines for the siege. On\nJuly 14th, 1099, the attack was made, and after resistance gallant and\ndesperate as the assault, the crusaders burst into the city, massacred\nthe whole of the defenders and inhabitants, calculated at 70,000 in\nnumber, and so became masters of the holy sepulchre.\n\n\"The Sultan of Egypt was meanwhile advancing to the assistance of the\nMohammedans of Syria; but Godfrey, with 20,000 of his best men, advanced\nto meet the vast host, and scattered them as if they had been sheep.\nGodfrey was now chosen King of Jerusalem, and the rest of his army--save\n300 knights and 200 soldiers, who agreed to remain with him--returned to\ntheir home. The news of the victory led other armies of crusaders to\nfollow the example of that of Godfrey; but as these were almost as\ncompletely without organization or leadership as those of Peter the\nHermit, they suffered miserably on their way, and few indeed ever\nreached the Holy Land. Godfrey died in 1100, and his brother Baldwin\nsucceeded him.\n\n\"The history of the last 100 years has been full of fresh efforts to\ncrush the Moslem power, but hitherto it cannot be said that fortune has\nattended the efforts of the Christians. Had it not been indeed for the\ndevotion of the Knights of St. John and of the Templars, two great\ncompanies formed of men who devoted their lives to the holding of the\nsepulchre against the infidel, our hold of the Holy Land would have\nbeen lost.\n\n\"Gradually the Saracens have wrested post after post from our hands.\nEdessa was taken in 1144, and the news of this event created an intense\nexcitement. The holy St. Bernard stirred up all France, and Louis VII.\nhimself took the vow and headed a noble army. The ways of God are not our\nways, and although the army of Germany joined that of France, but little\nresults came of this great effort. The Emperor Conrad, with the Germans,\nwas attacked by the Turk Saladin of Iconium, and was defeated with a loss\nof 60,000 men. The King of France, with his army, was also attacked with\nfury, and a large portion of his force were slaughtered. Nothing more\ncame of this great effort, and while the first Crusade seemed to show\nthat the men-at-arms of Europe were irresistible, the second on the\ncontrary gave proof that the Turks were equal to the Christian knights.\nGradually the Christian hold of the Holy Land was shaken. In 1187,\nalthough fighting with extraordinary bravery, the small army of Christian\nKnights of the Temple and of St. John were annihilated, the King of\nJerusalem was made prisoner, and the Christian power was crushed. Then\nSaladin, who commanded the Turks, advanced against Jerusalem, and forced\nit to capitulate.\n\n\"Such, my boy, is the last sad news which has reached us; and no wonder\nthat it has stirred the hearts of the monarchs of Europe, and that every\neffort will be again made to recapture the holy sepulchre, and to avenge\nour brethren who have been murdered by the infidels.\"\n\n\"But, Father Francis, from your story it would seem that Europe has\nalready sacrificed an enormous number of lives to take the holy\nsepulchre, and that after all the fighting, when she has taken it, it is\nonly to lose it again.\"\n\n\"That is so, my son; but we will trust that in future things will be\nbetter managed. The Templars and Hospitallers now number so vast a number\nof the best lances in Europe, and are grown to be such great powers, that\nwe may believe that when we have again wrested the holy sepulchre from\nthe hands of the infidels they will be able to maintain it against all\nassaults. Doubtless the great misfortunes which have fallen upon the\nChristian armies have been a punishment from heaven, because they have\nnot gone to work in the right spirit. It is not enough to take up lance\nand shield, and to place a red cross upon the shoulder. Those who desire\nto fight the battle of the Lord must cleanse their hearts, and go forth\nin the spirit of pilgrims rather than knights. I mean, not that they\nshould trust wholly to spiritual weapons--for in truth the infidel is a\nfoe not to be despised--but I mean, that they should lay aside all\nthoughts of worldly glory, and rivalry one against another.\"\n\n\"And think you, Father, that such is the spirit with which King Richard\nand the other kings and nobles now preparing to go to the Holy Land are\nanimated?\"\n\nFather Francis hesitated.\n\n\"It is not for me, my son, to judge motives, or to speak well or ill the\ninstruments who have been chosen for this great work. It is of all works\nthe most praiseworthy, most holy. It is horrible to think that the holy\nshrines of Jerusalem should be in the hands of men who believe not in our\nRedeemer; and I hold it to be the duty of every man who can bear arms, no\nmatter what his rank or his station, to don his armour and to go forth to\nbattle in the cause. Whether success will crown the effort, or whether\nGod wills it otherwise, it is not for man to discuss; it is enough that\nthe work is there, and it is our duty to do it.\"\n\n\"And think you, Father, that it will do good to England?\"\n\n\"That do I, my son, whether we gain the Holy Land or no. Methinks that it\nwill do good service to the nation that Saxon and Norman should fight\ntogether under the holy cross. Hitherto the races have stood far too\nmuch apart. They have seen each other's bad qualities rather than good;\nbut methinks that when the Saxon and the Norman stand side by side on the\nsoil of the Holy Land, and shout together for England, it must needs bind\nthem together, and lead them to feel that they are no longer Normans and\nSaxons, but Englishmen. I intend to preach on the village green at\nEvesham next Sunday morning on this subject, and as I know you are in\ncommunication with the forest men, I would, Cuthbert, that you would\npersuade them to come in to hear me. You were wondering what could be\nfound for these vagrants. They have many of them long since lost the\nhabits of honest labour. Many of them are still serfs, although most have\nbeen freed by the good earl and the knights his followers. Some of those\nwho would fain leave the life in the woods, still cling to it because\nthey think that it would be mean to desert their comrades, who being\nserfs are still bound to lurk there; but methinks that this is a great\nopportunity for them. They are valiant men, and the fact that they are\nfond of drawing an arrow at a buck does not make them one whit the worse\nChristians. I will do my best to move their hearts, and if they will but\nagree together to take the cross, they would make a goodly band of\nfootmen to accompany the earl.\"\n\n\"Is the earl going?\" Cuthbert asked eagerly.\n\n\"I know not for certain,\" said Father Francis; \"but I think from what I\nhear from his chaplain, Father Eustace, that his mind turns in that\ndirection.\"\n\n\"Then, Father, if he goes, I will go too,\" Cuthbert exclaimed. \"He\npromised to take me as his page the first time he went to war.\"\n\nFather Francis shook his head.\n\n\"I fear me, Cuthbert, this is far from the spirit in which we a while ago\nagreed that men should go to the holy war.\"\n\nCuthbert hung his head a little.\n\n\"Ay, Father Francis, men; but I am a boy,\" he said, \"and after all, boys\nare fond of adventure for adventure's sake. However, Father,\" he said,\nwith a smile, \"no doubt your eloquence on the green will turn me mightily\nto the project, for you must allow that the story you have told me this\nmorning is not such as to create any very strong yearning in one's mind\nto follow the millions of men who have perished in the Holy Land.\"\n\n\"Go to,\" said Father Francis, smiling, \"thou art a pert varlet. I will do\nmy best on Sunday to turn you to a better frame of mind.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. PREPARATIONS.\n\n\nNext Sunday a large number of people from some miles round were gathered\non the green at Evesham, to hear Father Francis preach on the holy\nsepulchre. The forest men in their green jerkins mingled with the crowd,\nand a look of attention and seriousness was on the faces of all, for the\nnews of the loss of the holy sepulchre had really exercised a great\neffect upon the minds of the people in England as elsewhere.\n\nThose were the days of pilgrimage to holy places, when the belief in the\nsanctity of places and things was overwhelming, and when men believed\nthat a journey to the holy shrines was sufficient to procure for them a\npardon for all their misdeeds. The very word \"infidel\" in those days was\nfull of horror, and the thought that the holy places of the Christians\nwere in the hands of Moslems, affected all Christians throughout Europe\nwith a feeling of shame as well as of grief.\n\nAmong the crowd were many of the Norman retainers from the castle and\nfrom many of the holds around, and several knights with the ladies of\ntheir family stood a little apart from the edge of the gathering; for it\nwas known that Father Francis would not be alone, but that he would be\naccompanied by a holy friar who had returned from the East, and who could\ntell of the cruelties which the Christians had suffered at the hands of\nthe Saracens.\n\nFather Francis, at ordinary times a tranquil preacher, was moved beyond\nhimself by the theme on which he was holding forth. He did not attempt\nto hide from those who stood around that the task to be undertaken was\none of grievous peril and trial; that disease and heat, hunger and\nthirst, must be dared, as well as the sword of the infidel. But he\nspoke of the grand nature of the work, of the humiliation to Christians\nof the desecration of the shrines, and of the glory which awaited those\nwho joined the crusade, whether they lived or whether they died in the\nHoly Land.\n\nHis words had a strong effect upon the simple people who listened to him,\nbut the feelings so aroused were as nought to the enthusiasm which\ngreeted the address of the friar.\n\nMeagre and pale, with a worn, anxious face as one who had suffered much,\nthe friar, holding aloft two pieces of wood from the Mount of Olives tied\ntogether in the form of a cross, harangued the crowd. His words poured\nforth in a fiery stream, kindling the hearts, and stirring at once the\ndevotion and the anger of his listeners.\n\nHe told of the holy places, he spoke of the scenes of Holy Writ, which\nhad there been enacted; and then he depicted the men who had died for\nthem. He told of the knights and men-at-arms, each of whom proved himself\nagain and again a match for a score of infidels. He spoke of the holy\nwomen, who, fearlessly and bravely, as the knights themselves, had borne\ntheir share in the horrors of the siege and in the terrible times which\nhad preceded it.\n\nHe told them that this misfortune had befallen Christianity because of\nthe lukewarmness which had come upon them.\n\n\"What profited it,\" he asked, \"if the few knights who remained to defend\nthe holy sepulchre were heroes? A few heroes cannot withstand an army. If\nChristendom after making a mighty effort to capture the holy sepulchre\nhad not fallen away, the conquest which had been made with so vast an\nexpenditure of blood would not have been lost. This is a work in which no\nmere passing fervour will avail; bravery at first, endurance afterwards,\nare needed. Many men must determine not only to assist to wrest the holy\nsepulchre from the hands of the infidels, but to give their lives, so\nlong as they might last, to retaining it. It is scarce to be expected\nthat men with wives and families will take a view like this, indeed it is\nnot to be desired. But there are single men, men of no ties, who can\ndevote their whole lives, as did the Knights of the Orders of the Cross,\nto this great object. When their life has come to an end, doubtless\nothers will take up the banner that their hands can no longer hold. But\nfor life it is, indeed, that many of humble as well as of princely class\nmust bind themselves to take and defend to death the holy sepulchre.\"\n\nSo, gradually raising the tone of his speech, the friar proceeded;\nuntil at length by his intense earnestness, his wild gesticulations,\nhis impassioned words, he drew the whole of his listeners along with\nhim; and when he ceased, a mighty shout of \"To the Holy Land!\" burst\nfrom his hearers.\n\nFalling upon their knees, the crowd begged of him to give them the sign\nof the cross, and to bestow his blessing upon their swords, and upon\ntheir efforts.\n\nFather Francis had prepared, in contemplation of such a movement, a large\nnumber of small white crosses of cloth. These he and the friar now\nfastened to the shoulders of the men as they crowded up to receive it,\nholding their hands aloft, kissing the cross that the Friar extended to\nthem, and swearing to give their lives, if need be, to rescue the holy\nshrines from the infidel.\n\nWhen all had received the holy symbol, Father Francis again ascended the\nbank from which they had addressed the crowd:\n\n\"Now go to your homes, my sons,\" he said. \"Think of the oath that you\nhave taken, and of the course that lies open to you when the time comes.\nWhen King Richard is prepared to start, then will you be called upon to\nfulfil your vows. It may be that all who have sworn may not be called\nupon to go. It needs that the land here should be tilled, it needs that\nthere should be protectors for the women and children, it needs that this\nEngland of ours should flourish, and we cannot give all her sons, however\nwilling they might be to take the cross. But the willingness which you\nwill, I am sure, show to go if needs be, and to redeem your vows, will be\nsufficient. Some must go and some must stay; these are matters to be\ndecided hereafter; for the time let us separate; you will hear when the\nhour for action arrives.\"\n\nA fortnight later the Earl of Evesham, who had been on a long journey to\nLondon, returned with full authority to raise and organize a force as his\ncontingent to the holy wars.\n\nAll was now bustle and activity in the castle.\n\nFather Francis informed him of the willingness of such of the forest men\nas he deemed fit to enlist under his banner; and the earl was much\ngratified at finding that the ranks of heavily-armed retainers whom he\nwould take with him, were to be swollen by the addition of so useful a\ncontingent as that of 100 skilful archers.\n\nCuthbert was not long in asking for an interview with the earl.\n\nHe had indeed great difficulty in persuading Dame Editha that he was old\nenough to share in the fatigues of so great an expedition, but he had\nFather Francis on his side; and between the influence of her confessor,\nand the importunities of her son, the opposition of the good lady fell to\nthe ground.\n\nCuthbert was already, for his age, well trained to arms. Many of the old\nsoldiers at the castle who had known and loved his father, had been ever\nready to give lessons in the use of arms to Cuthbert, who was\nenthusiastic in his desire to prove as good a knight as his father had\nbeen. His friends, the outlaws, had taught him the use of the bow and of\nthe quarter-staff; and Cuthbert, strong and well-built for his age, and\nhaving little to do save to wield the sword and the bow, had attained a\nvery considerable amount of skill with each.\n\nHe had too, which was unusual, a certain amount of book learning,\nalthough this, true to say, had not been acquired so cheerfully or\nwillingly as the skill at arms. Father Francis had, however, taught him\nto read and to write--accomplishments which were at that time rare,\nexcept in the cloister. In those days if a knight had a firm seat in his\nsaddle, a strong arm, a keen eye, and high courage, it was thought to be\nof little matter whether he could or could not do more than make his mark\non the parchment. The whole life of the young was given to acquiring\nskill in arms; and unless intended for the convent, any idea of education\nwould in the great majority of cases have been considered as\npreposterous.\n\nTo do Cuthbert justice, he had protested with all his might against\nthe proposition of Father Francis to his mother to teach him some\nclerkly knowledge. He had yielded most unwillingly at last to her\nentreaties, backed as they were by the sound arguments and good sense\nof Father Francis.\n\nThe Earl of Evesham received Cuthbert's application very graciously.\n\n\"Certainly, Cuthbert,\" he said, \"you shall accompany me; first, on\naccount of my promise to you; secondly, because from the readiness you\ndisplayed both in the matter of my daughter and of the attack on Wortham,\nyou will be a notable aid and addition to my party; thirdly, from my\nfriendship for your father and Dame Editha.\"\n\nThis point being settled, Cuthbert at once assumed his new duties. There\nwas plenty for him to do--to see that the orders of the earl were\nproperly carried out; to bear messages to the knights who followed the\nearl's fortunes, at their various holds; to stand by and watch the\narmourers at work, and the preparation of the stores of arms and missiles\nwhich would be necessary for the expedition.\n\nSometimes he would go round to summon the tenants of the various farms\nand lands, who held from the earl, to come to the castle; and here Sir\nWalter would, as far as might be without oppression, beg of them to\ncontribute largely to the expedition.\n\nIn these appeals he was in no slight way assisted by Father Francis, who\npointed out loudly to the people that those who stayed behind were bound\nto make as much sacrifice of their worldly goods, as those who went to\nthe war might make of their lives. Life and land are alike at the service\nof God. Could the land be sold, it would be a good deed to sell it; but\nas this could not be, they should at least sell all that they could, and\npledge their property if they could find lenders, in order to contribute\nto the needs of their lord, and the fitting out of this great enterprise.\n\nThe preparations were at last complete, and a gallant band gathered at\nthe castle ready for starting. It consisted of some 200 men-at-arms led\nby six knights, and of 100 bowmen dressed in Lincoln green, with quilted\njerkins to keep out the arrows of the enemy. All the country from around\ngathered to see the start. Dame Editha was there, and by her side stood\nthe earl's little daughter. The earl himself was in armour, and beside\nhim rode Cuthbert in the gay attire of a page.\n\nJust at that moment, however, his face did not agree with his costume,\nfor although he strove his best to look bright and smiling, it was a\nhard task to prevent the tears from filling his eyes at his departure\nfrom his mother. The good lady cried unrestrainedly, and Margaret joined\nin her tears. The people who had gathered round cheered lustily; the\ntrumpets blew a gay fanfaronade; and the squire threw to the wind the\nearl's colours.\n\nIt was no mere pleasure trip on which they were starting, for all knew\nthat, of the preceding crusades, not one in ten of those who had gone so\ngladly forth had ever returned.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the whole of those present were animated by\nany strong religious feeling. No doubt there existed a desire, which was\ncarefully fanned by the preaching of the priests and monks, to rescue the\nholy sepulchre from the hands of the Saracens; but a far stronger\nfeeling was to be found in the warlike nature of the people in those\ndays. Knights, men-at-arms, and indeed men of all ranks, were full of a\ncombative spirit. Life in the castle and hut was alike dull and\nmonotonous, and the excitement of war and adventure was greatly looked\nfor, both as a means of obtaining glory and booty, and for the change\nthey afforded to the dreary monotony of life.\n\nThere is little to tell of the journey of the Earl of Evesham's band\nthrough England to Southampton, at which place they took ship and crossed\nto France--or rather to Normandy, for in those days Normandy was\nregarded, as indeed it formed, a part of England.\n\nCuthbert, as was natural to his age, was full of delight at all the\nvarying scenes through which they passed. The towns were to him an\nespecial source of wonder, for he had never visited any other than that\nof Worcester, to which he had once or twice been taken on occasions of\nhigh festival. Havre was in those days an important place, and being the\nlanding-place of a great portion of the English bands, it was full of\nbustle and excitement. Every day ships brought in nobles and their\nfollowings.\n\nThe King of England was already in Normandy hastening the preparations,\nand each band, as it landed, marched down to the meeting-place on the\nplains of Vezelay. Already they began to experience a taste of the\nhardships which they were to endure.\n\nIn those days there was no regular supply train for an army, but each\ndivision or band supported itself by purchase or pillage, as the case\nmight be, from the surrounding country.\n\nAs the English troops were marching through a friendly country, pillage\nwas of course strictly forbidden; but while many of the leaders paid for\nall they had, it must be owned that among the smaller leaders were many\nwho took anything that they required with or without payment.\n\nThe country was eaten up.\n\nThe population in those days was sparse, and the movement of so large a\nnumber of men along a certain route completely exhausted all the\nresources of the inhabitants; and although willing to pay for all that\nhis men required, the Earl of Evesham had frequently to lie down on the\nturf supperless himself.\n\n\"If this is the case now,\" he said to Cuthbert, \"what will it be after we\nhave joined the French army? Methinks whatever we may do if we reach the\nHoly Land, that we have a fair chance of being starved before we sail.\"\n\nAfter a long succession of marches they arrived in sight of the great\ncamp at Vezelay. It was indeed rather a canvas town than a camp. Here\nwere gathered nearly 100,000 men, a vast host at any time, but in those\ndays far greater in proportion to the strength of the countries than at\npresent. The tents of the leaders, nobles, and other knights and\ngentlemen, rose in regular lines, forming streets and squares.\n\nThe great mass of troops, however, were contented to sleep in the open\nair; indeed the difficulties of carriage were so great that it was only\nthe leaders who could carry with them their canvas abodes. Before each\ntent stood the lance and colours of its owner, and side by side in the\ncentre of the camp stood the royal pavilions of Phillip of France and\nRichard of England, round which could be seen the gonfalons of all the\nnobles of Western Europe.\n\nNothing could be gayer than the aspect of this camp as the party rode\ninto it. They were rather late, and the great body of the host were\nalready assembled.\n\nCuthbert gazed with delight at the varied colours, the gay dresses, the\nmartial knights, and the air of discipline and order which reigned\neverywhere.\n\nThis was indeed war in its most picturesque form, a form which, as far as\nbeauty is concerned, has been altogether altered, and indeed destroyed,\nby modern arms.\n\nIn those days individual prowess and bravery went for everything. A\nhandful of armoured knights were a match for thousands of footmen, and\nbattles were decided as much by the prowess and bravery of the leader and\nhis immediate following as by that of the great mass of the army.\n\nThe earl had the day before sent on a messenger to state that he was\ncoming, and as the party entered the camp they were met by a squire of\nthe camp-marshal, who conducted them to the position allotted to them.\n\nThe earl's tent was soon erected, with four or five grouped around it for\nhis knights, one being set aside for his squires and pages.\n\nWhen this was done, Cuthbert strolled away to look at the varied sights\nof the camp. A military officer in these days would be scandalized at the\nscenes which were going on, but the strict, hard military discipline of\nmodern times was then absolutely unknown.\n\nA camp was a moving town, and to it flocked the country people with their\ngoods; smiths and armourers erected their forges; minstrels and\ntroubadours flocked in to sing of former battles, and to raise the\nspirits of the soldiers by merry lays of love and war; simple countrymen\nand women came in to bring their presents of fowls or cakes to their\nfriends in camp; knights rode to and fro on their gaily caparisoned\nhorses through the crowd; the newly raised levies, in many cases composed\nof woodmen and peasants who had not in the course of their lives wandered\na league from their birthplaces, gaped in unaffected wonder at the sights\naround them; while last, but by no means least, the maidens and good\nwives of the neighbourhood, fond then as now of brave men and gay\ndresses, thronged the streets of the camp, and joined in, and were the\ncause of, merry laughter and jest.\n\nHere and there, a little apart from the main stream of traffic, the\nminstrels would take up their position, and playing a gay air, the\nsoldier lads and lasses would fall to and foot it merrily to the strains.\nSometimes there would be a break in the gaiety, and loud shouts, and\nperhaps fierce oaths, would rise. Then the maidens would fly like\nstartled fawns, and men hasten to the spot; though the quarrel might be\npurely a private one, yet should it happen between the retainers of two\nnobles, the friends of each would be sure to strike in, and serious frays\nwould arise before the marshal of the camp with his posse could arrive to\ninterfere. Sometimes indeed these quarrels became so serious and\ndesperate that alliances were broken up and great intentions frustrated\nby the quarrels of the soldiery.\n\nHere and there, on elevated platforms, or even on the top of a pile of\ntubs, were friars occupied in haranguing the soldiers, and in inspiring\nthem with enthusiasm for the cause upon which they were embarked. The\nconduct of their listeners showed easily enough the motives which had\nbrought them to war. Some stood with clasped hands and eager eyes\nlistening to the exhortations of the priests, and ready, as might be\nseen from their earnest gaze, to suffer martyrdom in the cause. More,\nhowever, stood indifferently round, or after listening to a few words\nwalked on with a laugh or a scoff; indeed preaching had already done all\nthat lay in its power. All those who could be moved by exhortations of\nthis kind were there, and upon the rest the discourses and sermons were\nthrown away.\n\nSeveral times in the course of his stroll round the camp Cuthbert\nobserved the beginnings of quarrels, which were in each case only checked\nby the intervention of some knight or other person in authority coming\npast, and he observed that these in every instance occurred between men\nof the English and those of the French army.\n\nBetween the Saxon contingent of King Richard's army and the French\nsoldiers there could indeed be no quarrel, for the Saxons understood no\nword of their language; but with the Normans the case was different, for\nthe Norman-French, which was spoken by all the nobles and their retainers\nin Britain, was as nearly as possible the same as that in use in France.\n\nIt seemed, however, to Cuthbert, watching narrowly what was going on,\nthat there existed by no means a good feeling between the men of the\ndifferent armies; and he thought that this divergence so early in the\ncampaign boded but little good for the final success of the expedition.\n\nWhen he returned to the tent the earl questioned him as to what he had\nseen, and Cuthbert frankly acknowledged that it appeared to him that the\nfeeling between the men of the two armies was not good.\n\n\"I have been,\" the earl said, \"to the royal camp, and from what I hear,\nCuthbert, methinks that there is reason for what you say. King Richard is\nthe most loyal and gallant of kings, but he is haughty, and hasty in\nspeech. The Normans, too, have been somewhat accustomed to conquer our\nneighbours, and it may well be that the chivalry of France love us not.\nHowever, it must be hoped that this feeling will die away, and that we\nshall emulate each other only in our deeds on the battlefield.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE LISTS.\n\n\nThe third day after the arrival of the Earl of Evesham there was a\ngreat banquet given by the King of France to King Richard and his\nprincipal nobles.\n\nAmong those present was the Earl of Evesham, and Cuthbert as his page\nfollowed him to the great tent where the banquet was prepared.\n\nHere, at the top of the tent, on a raised dais, sat the King of France,\nsurrounded by his courtiers.\n\nThe Earl of Evesham, having been conducted by the herald to the dais,\npaid his compliments to the king, and was saluted by him with many\nflattering words.\n\nThe sound of a trumpet was heard, and Richard of England, accompanied by\nhis principal nobles, entered.\n\nIt was the first time that Cuthbert had seen the king.\n\nRichard was a man of splendid stature and of enormous strength. His\nappearance was in some respects rather Saxon than Norman, for his hair\nwas light and his complexion clear and bright. He wore the moustache and\npointed beard at that time in fashion; and although his expression was\ngenerally that of frankness and good humour, there might be observed in\nhis quick motions and piercing glances signs of the hasty temper and\nunbridled passion which went far to wreck the success of the enterprise\nupon which he was embarked.\n\nRichard possessed most of the qualities which make a man a great king and\nrender him the idol of his subjects, especially in a time of\nsemi-civilization, when personal prowess is placed at the summit of all\nhuman virtues. In all his dominions there was not one man who in personal\nconflict was a match for his king.\n\nExcept during his fits of passion, King Richard was generous, forgiving,\nand royal in his moods. He was incapable of bearing malice. Although\nhaughty of his dignity, he was entirely free from any personal pride, and\nwhile he would maintain to the death every right and privilege against\nanother monarch, he could laugh and joke with the humblest of his\nsubjects on terms of hearty good fellowship. He was impatient of\ncontradiction, eager to carry out whatever he had determined upon; and\nnothing enraged him so much as hesitation or procrastination. The delays\nwhich were experienced in the course of the Crusade angered him more than\nall the opposition offered by the Saracens, or than the hardships through\nwhich the Christian host had to pass.\n\nAt a flourish of trumpets all took their seats at dinner, their places\nbeing marked for them by a herald, whose duty it was to regulate nicely\nthe various ranks and dignities.\n\nThe Earl of Evesham was placed next to a noble of Brabant. Cuthbert\ntook his place behind his lord and served him with wines and meats,\nthe Brabant being attended by a tall youth, who was indeed on the\nverge of manhood.\n\nAs the dinner went on the buzz of conversation became fast and furious.\nIn those days men drank deep, and quarrels often arose over the cups.\nFrom the time that the dinner began, Cuthbert noticed that the manner of\nSir de Jacquelin Barras, Count of Brabant, was rude and offensive.\n\nIt might be that he was accustomed to live alone with his retainers, and\nthat his manners were rude and coarse to all. It might be that he had a\nspecial hostility to the English. At any rate, his remarks were\ncalculated to fire the anger of the earl.\n\nHe began the conversation by wondering how a Norman baron could live in a\ncountry like England, inhabited by a race but little above pigs.\n\nThe earl at once fired up at this, for the Normans were now beginning to\nfeel themselves English, and to resent attacks upon a people for whom\ntheir grandfathers had entertained contempt.\n\nHe angrily repelled the attack upon them by the Brabant knight, and\nasserted at once that the Saxons were every bit as civilized, and in some\nrespects superior, to the Normans or French.\n\nThe ill-feeling thus begun at starting clearly waxed stronger as dinner\nwent on. The Brabant knight drank deeply, and although his talk was not\nclearly directed against the English, yet he continued to throw out\ninnuendoes and side attacks, and to talk with a vague boastfulness, which\ngreatly irritated Sir Walter.\n\nPresently, as Cuthbert was about to serve his master with a cup of wine,\nthe tall page pushed suddenly against him, spilling a portion of the wine\nover his dress.\n\n\"What a clumsy child!\" he said scoffingly.\n\n\"You are a rough and ill-mannered loon,\" Cuthbert said angrily. \"Were\nyou in any other presence I would chastise you as you deserve.\"\n\nThe tall page burst into a mocking laugh.\n\n\"Chastise me!\" he said. \"Why, I could put you in my pocket for a little\nhop-of-my-thumb as you are.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Sir Jacquelin--for the boys' voices both rose\nloud--to the earl, \"you had better send that brat home and order him\nto be whipped.\"\n\n\"Sir count,\" said the earl, \"your manners are insolent, and were we not\nengaged upon a Crusade, it would please me much to give you a lesson on\nthat score.\"\n\nHigher and higher the dispute rose, until some angry word caught the ear\nof the king.\n\nAmid the general buzz of voices King Phillip rose, and speaking a word to\nKing Richard, moved from the table, thus giving the sign for the breaking\nup of the feast.\n\nImmediately afterwards a page touched the earl and Sir Jacquelin upon the\nshoulder, and told them that the kings desired to speak with them in the\ntent of the King of France.\n\nThe two nobles strode through the crowd, regarding each other with eyes\nmuch like those of two dogs eager to fly at each other's throat.\n\n\"My lords, my lords,\" said King Phillip when they entered, \"this is\nagainst all law and reason. For shame, to be brawling at my table. I\nwould not say aught openly, but methinks it is early indeed for the\nknights and nobles engaged in a common work to fall to words.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" said the Earl of Evesham, \"I regret deeply what has\nhappened. But it seemed, from the time we sat down to the meal, that this\nlord sought to pass a quarrel upon me, and I now beseech your Majesty\nthat you will permit us to settle our differences in the lists.\"\n\nKing Richard gave a sound of assent, but the King of France shook his\nhead gravely.\n\n\"Do you forget,\" he said, \"the mission upon which you are assembled\nhere? Has not every knight and noble in these armies taken a solemn oath\nto put aside private quarrels and feuds until the holy sepulchre is\ntaken? Shall we at this very going off show that the oath is a mere form\nof words? Shall we show before the face of Christendom that the knights\nof the cross are unable to avoid flying at each other's throats, even\nwhile on their way to wrest the holy sepulchre from the infidel? No,\nsirs, you must lay aside your feuds, and must promise me and my good\nbrother here that you will keep the peace between you until this war is\nover. Whose fault it was that the quarrel began I know not. It may be\nthat my Lord of Brabant was discourteous. It may be that the earl here\nwas too hot. But whichever it be, it matters not.\"\n\n\"The quarrel, sire,\" said Sir Jacquelin, \"arose from a dispute between\nour pages, who were nigh coming to blows in your Majesty's presence. I\ndesired the earl to chide the insolence of his varlet, and instead of so\ndoing he met my remarks with scorn.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh,\" said King Richard, \"there are plenty of grounds for quarrel\nwithout two nobles interfering in the squabbles of boys. Let them fight;\nit will harm no one. By-the-bye, your Majesty,\" he said, turning to the\nKing of France with a laugh, \"if the masters may not fight, there is no\nreason in the world why the varlets should not. We are sorely dull for\nwant of amusement. Let us have a list to-morrow, and let the pages fight\nit out for the honour of their masters and their nations.\"\n\n\"It were scarce worth while to have the lists set for two boys to fight,\"\nsaid the King of France.\n\n\"Oh, we need not have regular lists,\" said King Richard. \"Leave that\nmatter in my hands. I warrant you that if the cockerels are well plucked,\nthey will make us sport. What say you, gentlemen?\"\n\nThe Brabant noble at once assented, answering that he was sure that his\npage would be glad to enter the lists; and the earl gave a similar\nassent, for he had not noticed how great was the discrepancy between the\nsize of the future combatants.\n\n\"That is agreed, then,\" said King Richard joyously. \"I will have a piece\nof ground marked out on the edge of the camp to-morrow morning. It shall\nbe kept by my men-at-arms, and there shall be a raised place for King\nPhillip and myself, who will be the judges of the conflict. Will they\nfight on foot or on horse?\"\n\n\"On foot, on foot,\" said the King of France. \"It would be a pity that\nknightly exercises should be brought to scorn by any failure on their\npart on horseback. On foot at least it will be a fair struggle.\"\n\n\"What arms shall they use?\" the Brabant knight asked.\n\n\"Oh, swords and battle-axes, of course,\" said King Richard with a laugh.\n\n\"Before you go,\" King Phillip said, \"you must shake hands, and swear\nto let the quarrel between you drop, at least until after our return.\nIf you still wish to shed each other's blood, I shall offer no\nhindrance thereto.\"\n\nThe earl and Count Jacquelin touched each other's hands in obedience to\nthe order, went out of the tent together, and strode off without a word\nin different directions.\n\n\"My dear lad,\" the Earl of Evesham said on entering his tent where his\npage was waiting him, \"this is a serious business. The kings have\nordered this little count and myself to put aside our differences till\nafter the Crusade, in accordance with our oath. But as you have no wise\npledged yourself in the same fashion, and as their Majesties fell\nsomewhat dull while waiting here, it is determined that the quarrel\nbetween me, and between you and the count's page, shall be settled by a\nfight between you in the presence of the kings.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" Cuthbert said, \"I am glad that it should be, seeing the\nvarlet insulted me without cause, and purposely upset the cup over me.\"\n\n\"What is he like?\" the earl asked. \"Dost think that you are a\nfair match?\"\n\n\"I doubt not that we are fair match enough,\" Cuthbert said. \"As you know,\nsir, I have been well trained to arms of all kinds, both by my father and\nby the men-at-arms at the castle, and could hold my own against any of\nyour men with light weapons, and have then no fear that this gawky loon,\ntwenty years old though he seems to be, will bring disgrace upon me or\ndiscredit upon my nation.\"\n\n\"If thou thinkest so,\" the earl said, \"the matter can go on. But had it\nbeen otherwise, I would have gone to the king and protested that the\nadvantage of age was so great that it would be murder to place you in the\nlist together.\"\n\n\"There is,\" Cuthbert said, \"at most no greater difference between us than\nbetween a strong man and a weak one, and these, in the ordeal of battle,\nhave to meet in the lists. Indeed I doubt if the difference is so great,\nfor if he be a foot taller than I, methinks that round the shoulders I\nshould have the advantage of him.\"\n\n\"Send hither my armourer,\" the earl said; \"we must choose a proper suit\nfor you. I fear that mine would be of little use; but doubtless there are\nsome smaller suits among my friends.\"\n\n\"The simpler and lighter the better,\" Cuthbert said. \"I'd rather have a\nlight coat of mail and a steel cap, than heavy armour and a helmet that\nwould press me down and a visor through which I could scarcely see. The\nlighter the better, for after all if my sword cannot keep my head, sooner\nor later the armour would fail to do so too.\"\n\nThe armourer speedily arrived, and the knights and followers of the earl\nbeing called in and the case stated, there was soon found a coat of fine\nlinked mail, which fitted Cuthbert well. As to the steel cap, there was\nno difficulty whatever.\n\n\"You must have a plume at least,\" the earl said, and took some feathers\nfrom his own casque and fastened them in. \"Will you want a light sword\nand battle-axe?\"\n\n\"No,\" Cuthbert said, \"my arms are pretty well used to those of the\nmen-at-arms. I could wield my father's sword, and that was a heavy one.\"\n\nThe lightest of the earl's weapons were chosen, and it was agreed that\nall was now ready for the conflict to-morrow.\n\nIn the morning there was a slight bustle in the camp.\n\nThe news that a fight was to take place between an English and a Brabant\npage, by the permission of the Kings of England and France, that their\nMajesties were to be present, and that all was to be conducted on regular\nrules, caused a stir of excitement and novelty in the camp.\n\nNowhere is life duller than among a large body of men kept together for\nany time under canvas, and the thought of a combat of this novel kind\nexcited general interest.\n\nIn a meadow at a short distance from the camp, a body of King Richard's\nmen-at-arms marked off an oval space of about an acre. Upon one side of\nthis a tent was pitched for the kings, and a small tent was placed at\neach end for the combatants. Round the enclosure the men-at-arms formed\nthe ring, and behind them a dense body of spectators gathered, a place\nbeing set aside for nobles, and others of gentle blood.\n\nAt the hour fixed the Kings of England and France arrived together. King\nRichard was evidently in a state of high good humour, for he preferred\nthe clash of arms and the sight of combat to any other pleasure.\n\nThe King of France, on the other hand, looked grave. He was a far wiser\nand more politic king than Richard; and although he had consented to the\nsudden proposal, yet he felt in his heart that the contest was a foolish\none, and that it might create bad feeling among the men of the two\nnationalities whichever way it went. He had reserved to himself the right\nof throwing down the baton when the combat was to cease, and he\ndetermined to avail himself of this right, to put a stop to the conflict\nbefore either party was likely to sustain any deadly injury.\n\nWhen the monarchs had taken their places the trumpeters sounded their\ntrumpets, and the two combatants advanced on foot from their ends of the\nlists. A murmur of surprise and dissatisfaction broke from the crowd.\n\n\"My Lord of Evesham,\" the king said angrily to the earl, who with Count\nJacquelin was standing by the royal party, \"thou shouldst have said that\nthe difference between the two was too great to allow the combat to be\npossible. The Frenchman appears to be big enough to take your page under\nhis arm and walk off with him.\"\n\nThe difference was indeed very striking. The French champion was arrayed\nin a full suit of knightly armour--of course without the gold spurs which\nwere the distinguishing mark of that rank--and with his helmet and lofty\nplume of feathers he appeared to tower above Cuthbert, who, in his\nclose-fitting steel cap and link armour, seemed a very dwarf by the side\nof a giant.\n\n\"It is not size, sire, but muscle and pluck will win in a combat like\nthis. Your Majesty need not be afraid that my page will disgrace me. He\nis of my blood, though the kinship is not close. He is of mixed Saxon and\nNorman strain, and will, believe me, do no discredit to either.\"\n\nThe king's brow cleared, for in truth he was very proud of his English\nnationality, and would have been sorely vexed to see the discomfiture of\nan English champion, even though that champion were a boy.\n\n\"Brother Phillip,\" he said, turning to the king, \"I will wager my gold\nchain against yours on yonder stripling.\"\n\n\"Methinks that it were robbery to take your wager,\" the King of France\nsaid. \"The difference between their bulk is disproportionate. However, I\nwill not baulk your wish. My chain against yours.\"\n\nThe rule of the fight was that they were to commence with Swords, but\nthat either could, if he chose, use his battle-axe.\n\nThe fight need scarcely be described at length, for the advantage was all\none way. Cuthbert was fully a match in strength for his antagonist,\nalthough standing nigh a foot shorter. Constant exercise, however, had\nhardened his muscles into something like steel, while the teaching that\nhe had received had embraced all that was then known of the use of arms.\n\nScience in those days there was but little of; it was a case rather of\nhard, heavy hitting, than of what we now call swordsmanship.\n\nWith the sword Cuthbert gained but slight advantage over his adversary,\nwhose superior height enabled him to rain blows down upon the lad, which\nhe was with difficulty enabled to guard; but when the first paroxysm of\nhis adversary's attack had passed, he took to the offensive, and drove\nhis opponent back step by step. With his sword, however, he was unable to\ncut through the armour of the Frenchman, but in the course of the\nencounter, guarding a severe blow aimed at him, his sword was struck from\nhis hand, and he then, seizing his axe, made such play with it that his\nfoe dropped his own sword and took to the same weapon.\n\nIn this the superior height and weight of his opponent gave him even a\ngreater advantage than with the sword, and Cuthbert knowing this, used\nhis utmost dexterity and speed to avoid the sweeping blows showered upon\nhim. He himself had been enabled to strike one or two sweeping strokes,\nalways aiming at the same place, the juncture of the visor with the\nhelmet. At last the Frenchman struck him so heavy a blow that it beat\ndown his guard and struck his steel cap from his head, bringing him to\nthe knee. In an instant he was up, and before his foe could be again on\nguard, he whirled his axe round with all its force, and bringing it just\nat the point of the visor which he had already weakened with repeated\nblows, the edge of the axe stove clean through the armour, and the page\nwas struck senseless to the ground.\n\nA great shout broke from the English portion of the soldiery as Cuthbert\nleant over his prostrate foe, and receiving no answer to the question \"Do\nyou yield?\" rose to his feet, and signified to the squire who had kept\nnear that his opponent was insensible.\n\nKing Richard ordered the pursuivant to lead Cuthbert to the royal\nenclosure.\n\n\"Thou art a brave lad and a lusty,\" the king said, \"and hast borne thee\nin the fight as well as many a knight would have done. Wert thou older, I\nwould myself dub thee knight; and I doubt not that the occasion will yet\ncome when thou wilt do as good deeds upon the bodies of the Saracens as\nthou hast upon that long-shanked opponent of thine. Here is a gold chain;\ntake it as a proof that the King of England holds that you have sustained\nwell the honour of his country; and mark me, if at any time you require a\nboon, bring or send me that chain, and thou shall have it freely. Sir\nWalter,\" he said, turning to the earl, \"in this lad thou hast a worthy\nchampion, and I trust me that thou wilt give him every chance of\ndistinguishing himself. So soon as thou thinkst him fit for the knightly\nrank I myself will administer the accolade.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. REVENGE.\n\n\nAfter his interview with the king, Cuthbert was led to his tent amid the\nhearty plaudits of the English troops.\n\nHis own comrades flocked round him; the men of the greenwood headed by\nCnut, were especially jubilant over his victory.\n\n\"Who would have thought,\" said the tall forester, \"that the lad who but a\nshort time ago was a child, should now have sustained the honour of the\ncountry? We feel proud of you, Cuthbert; and trust us some day or other\nto follow wherever you may lead, and to do some deed which will attain\nfor you honour and glory, and to show that the men of Evesham are as\ndoughty as any under King Richard's rule.\"\n\n\"You must be wary, Cuthbert,\" the earl said to him that evening. \"Believe\nme that you and I have made a foe, who, although he may not have the\npower, has certainly the will to injure us to the death. I marked the eye\nof Count Jacquelin during the fight, and again when you were led up to\nthe king. There was hatred and fury in his eye. The page too, I hear, is\nhis own nephew, and he will be the laughing-stock of the French camp at\nhaving been conquered by one so much younger than himself. It will be\nwell to keep upon your guard, and not go out at night unattended. Keep\nCnut near you; he is faithful as a watch-dog, and would give his life, I\nam sure, for you. I will myself be also upon my guard, for it was after\nall my quarrel, and the fury of this fierce knight will vent itself upon\nboth of us if the opportunity should come. I hear but a poor account of\nhim among his confreres. They say he is one of those disgraces to the\nname of knight who are but a mixture of robber and soldier; that he\nharries all the lands in his neighbourhood; and that he has now only\njoined the Crusade to avoid the vengeance which the cries of the\noppressed people had invoked from his liege lord. I am told indeed that\nthe choice was given him to be outlawed, or to join the Crusades with\nall the strength he could raise. Naturally he adopted the latter\nalternative; but he has the instincts of the robber still, and will do us\nan evil turn, if he have the chance.\"\n\nTwo days later the great army broke up its camp and marched south. After\na week's journeying they encamped near a town, and halted there two or\nthree days in order to collect provisions for the next advance; for the\nsupplies which they could obtain in the country districts were wholly\ninsufficient for so great a host of men. Here the armies were to\nseparate, the French marching to Genoa, the English to Marseilles, the\ntown at which they were to take ship.\n\nOne evening the earl sent Cuthbert with a message for another English\nlord, staying in the town at the palace of the bishop, who was a friend\nof his.\n\nCnut accompanied Cuthbert, for he now made a point of seldom letting him\nout of his sight. It was light when they reached the bishop's palace, but\nhere they were delayed for some time, and night had fallen when they\nsallied out.\n\nThe town was quiet, for the inhabitants cared not to show themselves in\nthe streets now that such a large army of fierce men were in the\nneighbourhood.\n\nThe others indeed of the monarchs were stringent, but discipline there\nwas but little of, and the soldiery in those days regarded peaceful\ncitizens as fair game; hence, when they came from the palace the streets\nof the city were already hushed and quiet, for the orders of the king had\nbeen preemptory that no men-at-arms, or others except those on duty, were\nto be away from their camp after nightfall.\n\nThis order had been absolutely necessary, so many were the complaints\nbrought in by country peasants and farmers, of the doings of bands of\nsoldiers.\n\nCnut and Cuthbert proceeded along the streets unmolested for some\ndistance. Occasionally a solitary passer-by, with hooded cape, hurried\npast. The moon was half full, and her light was welcome indeed, for in\nthose days the streets were unlighted, and the pavement so bad that\npassage through the streets after dark was a matter of difficulty, and\neven of danger.\n\nHere and there before some roadside shrine a lamp dimly burned; before\nthese they paused, and, as good Catholics, Cnut and Cuthbert crossed\nthemselves. Just as they had passed one of these wayside shrines, a\nsudden shout was heard, and a party of eight or ten men sprang out from a\nside street and fell upon them.\n\nCnut and Cuthbert drew their swords and laid about them heartily, but\ntheir assailants were too strong. Cnut was stricken to the ground, and\nCuthbert, seeing that defence was hopeless, took to his heels and ran for\nhis life. He was already wounded, but happily not so severely as in any\nway to disable him.\n\nSeeing that it was speed, and speed alone, which now could save him, he\nflung aside his belt scabbard and as he ran, and with rapid steps flew\nalong the streets, not knowing whither he went, and striving only to keep\nahead of his pursuers. They, more encumbered by arms and armour, were\nunable to keep up with the flying footsteps of a lad clothed in the light\nattire of a page; but Cuthbert felt that the blood running from his wound\nwas weakening him fast, and that unless he could gain some refuge his\ncourse must speedily come to an end. Happily he saw at some little\ndistance ahead of him a man standing by a door. Just as he arrived the\ndoor opened, and a glow of light from within fell on the road, showing\nthat the person entering was a monk.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation Cuthbert rushed through the door, shouting\n\"Sanctuary!\" and sank almost fainting on the ground.\n\nThe monks, accustomed to wild pursuits and scenes of outrage in those\nwarlike days, hastily closed the door, barring it securely. In a moment\nthere was a rush of men against it from without.\n\nOne of the monks opened a lattice above the door.\n\n\"What mean you,\" he said, \"by this outrage? Know ye not that this is the\nMonastery of St. John, and that it is sacrilege to lay a hand of violence\neven against its postern? Begone,\" he said, \"or we'll lodge a complaint\nbefore the king.\"\n\nThe assailants, nothing daunted, continued to batter at the door; but at\nthis moment the monks, aroused from their beds, hastened to the spot, and\nseizing bill and sword--for in those days even monks were obliged at\ntimes to depend upon carnal weapons--they opened the door, and flung\nthemselves upon the assailants with such force that the latter, surprised\nand discomfited, were forced to make a hasty retreat.\n\nThe doors were then again barred, and Cuthbert was carried up to a cell\nin the building, where the leech of the monastery speedily examined his\nwound, and pronounced, that although his life was not in danger by it, he\nwas greatly weakened by the loss of blood, that the wound was a serious\none, and that it would be some time before the patient would recover.\n\nIt was two days before Cuthbert was sufficiently restored to be able to\nspeak. His first question to the monk was as to his whereabouts, and how\nlong he had been there. Upon being answered, he entreated that a\nmessenger might be despatched to the camp of the Earl of Evesham, to beg\nthat a litter might be sent for him, and to inquire what had become of\nCnut, whom he had last seen stricken down.\n\nThe monk replied, \"My son, I grieve to tell you that your request cannot\nbe complied with. The army moved away yesternoon, and is now some\nfive-and-twenty miles distant. There is nothing for you but patience, and\nwhen restored you can follow the army, and rejoin your master before he\nembarks at Marseilles. But how is it that a lad so young as you can have\nincurred the enmity of those who sought your life? For it is clear from\nthe pertinacity with which they urged their attack that their object was\nnot plunder, of which indeed they would get but little from you, but to\ntake your life.\"\n\nCuthbert recounted the circumstances which had led to the feud of the\nCount of Brabant against him, for he doubted not that this truculent\nknight was at the bottom of the attack.\n\n\"After what has happened,\" the monk said, \"you will need have caution\nwhen you leave here. The place where you have taken refuge is known to\nthem, and should this wild noble persist in his desire for vengeance\nagainst you, he will doubtless leave some of his ruffians to watch the\nmonastery. We will keep a look-out, and note if any strangers are to be\nseen near the gates; if we find that it is so, we shall consider what is\nbest to be done. We could of course appeal to the mayor for protection\nagainst them, and could even have the strangers ejected from the town or\ncast into prison; but it is not likely that we should succeed in\ncapturing more than the fellow who may be placed on the look-out, and the\ndanger would be in no wise lessened to yourself. But there is time to\ntalk over this matter before you leave. It will be another fortnight at\nleast before you will be able to pursue your journey.\"\n\nCuthbert gained strength more rapidly than the monk had expected. He was\ngenerously fed, and this and his good constitution soon enabled him to\nrecover from the loss of blood; and at the end of five days he expressed\nhis hope that he could on the following day pursue his journey. The monk\nwho attended him shook his head.\n\n\"Thou mightst, under ordinary circumstances, quit us to-morrow, for thou\nart well enough to take part in the ordinary pursuits of a page; but to\njourney is a different thing. You may have all sorts of hardships to\nendure; you may have even to trust for your life to your speed and\nendurance; and it would be madness for you to go until your strength is\nfully established. I regret to tell you that we have ascertained beyond a\ndoubt that the monastery is closely watched. We have sent some of the\nacolytes out, dressed in the garbs of monks, and attended by one of our\nelder brethren; and in each case, a monk who followed at a distance of\nfifty yards was able to perceive that they were watched. The town is full\nof rough men, the hangers-on of the army; some, indeed, are followers of\nlaggard knights, but the greater portion are men who merely pursue the\narmy with a view to gain by its necessities, to buy plunder from the\nsoldiers, and to rob, and, if necessary, to murder should there be a hope\nof obtaining gold. Among these men your enemies would have little\ndifficulty in recruiting any number, and no appeal that we could make to\nthe mayor would protect you from them when you have left the walls. We\nmust trust to our ingenuity in smuggling you out. After that, it is upon\nyour own strength and shrewdness that you must rely for an escape from\nany snares that may be laid for you. You will see, then, that at least\nanother three or four days are needed before you can set forth. Your\ncountrymen are so far away that a matter of a few days will make but\nlittle difference. They will in any case be delayed for a long time at\nMarseilles before they embark; and whether you leave now or a month\nhence, you would be equally in time to join them before their\nembarkation--that is, supposing that you make your way through the snares\nwhich beset you.\"\n\nCuthbert saw the justice of the reasoning, and it was another week\nbefore he announced himself as feeling absolutely restored to strength\nagain, and capable of bearing as much exertion as he could have done\nbefore his attack.\n\nA long consultation was held with the prior and a monk who had acted as\nhis leech, as to the best plan of getting Cuthbert beyond the walls of\nthe city. Many schemes were proposed and rejected. Every monk who\nventured beyond the walls had been closely scrutinized, and one or two of\nshort stature had even been jostled in the streets, so as to throw back\ntheir hoods and expose a sight of their faces. It was clear, then, that\nit would be dangerous to trust to a disguise. Cuthbert proposed that he\nshould leave at night, trusting solely to their directions as to the\nturnings he should take to bring him to the city walls, and that, taking\na rope, he should there let himself down, and make the best of his way\nforward. This, however, the monks would not consent to, assuring him that\nthe watch was so strictly kept round the monastery that he would\ninevitably be seen.\n\n\"No,\" the prior said, \"the method, whatever it is, must be as open as\npossible; and though I cannot at this moment hit upon a plan, I will\nthink it over to-night, and putting my ideas with those of Father Jerome\nhere, and the sacristan, who has a shrewd head, it will be hard if we\ncannot between us contrive some plan to evade the watch of those robber\nvillains who beset the convent.\"\n\nThe next morning when the prior came in to see Cuthbert, the latter said,\n\"Good father, I have determined not to endeavour to make off in disguise.\nI doubt not that your wit could contrive some means by which I should get\nclear of the walls without observation from the scouts of this villain\nnoble. But once in the country, I should have neither horse nor armour,\nand should have hard work indeed to make my way down through France, even\nthough none of my enemies were on my track. I will therefore, if it\nplease you, go down boldly to the Mayor, and claim a protection and\nescort. If he will but grant me a few men-at-arms for one day's ride from\nthe town, I can choose my own route, and riding out in mail can then take\nmy chance of finding my way down to Marseilles.\"\n\n\"I will go down with you, my son,\" the prior said, \"to the mayor. Two of\nmy monks shall accompany us; and assuredly no insult will be offered to\nyou in the street thus accompanied.\" Shortly afterwards, Cuthbert\nstarted as arranged, and soon arrived at the house of the mayor, Sir\nJohn de Cahors.\n\nUpon the prior making known to this knight whom he had brought with him,\nthe mayor exclaimed,--\n\n\"Pest! young gentleman; you have caused us no small trouble and concern.\nWe have had ridings to and fro concerning you, and furious messages from\nyour fiery king. When in the morning a tall, stalwart knave dressed in\ngreen was found, slashed about in various places, lying on the pavement,\nthe townsmen, not knowing who he was, but finding that he still\nbreathed, carried him to the English camp, and he was claimed as a\nfollower of the Earl of Evesham. There was great wrath and anger over\nthis; and an hour later the earl himself came down and stated that his\npage was missing, and that there was reason to believe that he had been\nfoully murdered, as he had accompanied the man found wounded.\nFortunately the bulk of the armies had marched away at early dawn, and\nthe earl had only remained behind in consequence of the absence of his\nfollowers. I assured the angry Englishman that I would have a thorough\nsearch made in the town; and although in no way satisfied, he rode off\nafter his king with all his force, carrying with him the long-limbed\nman whom we had picked up. Two days after, a message came back from King\nRichard himself, saying that unless this missing page were discovered,\nor if, he being killed, his murderers were not brought to justice and\npunished, he would assuredly on his return from the Holy Land burn the\ntown over our ears. Your king is not a man who minces matters. However,\nthreatened men live long, especially when the person who threatens is\nstarting for a journey, from which, as like or not, he may never return.\nHowever, I have had diligent search made for you. All the houses of bad\nrepute have been examined, and their inhabitants questioned. But there\nare so many camp-followers and other rabble at present in the town that\na hundred men might disappear without our being able to obtain a clue. I\ndoubted not indeed that your body had been thrown in the river, and that\nwe should never hear more of you. I am right glad that you have been\nrestored; not indeed from any fear of the threats of the king your\nmaster, but because, from what the Earl of Evesham said, you were a lad\nlikely to come to great fame and honour. The earl left in my charge your\nhorse, and the armour which he said you wore at a tournament lately, in\ncase we should hear aught of you.\"\n\nCuthbert gave an exclamation of pleasure. His purse contained but a few\npieces of silver, and being without arms except for his short dagger, or\nmeans of locomotion, the difficulties of the journey down to Marseilles\nhad sorely puzzled him. But with his good horse between his knees, and\nhis suit of Milan armour on his back, he thought that he might make his\nway through any dangers which threatened him.\n\nThe prior now told the knight that circumstances had occurred, which\nshowed that it was known to the assailants of Cuthbert that he had taken\nrefuge in the convent, over which a strict watch had been kept by\nCuthbert's enemies.\n\n\"If I could find the varlets, I would hang them over the gates of the\ntown,\" the knight said wrathfully. \"But as at the present moment there\nare nearly as many rogues as honest men in the place, it would be a\nwholesale hanging indeed to ensure getting hold of the right people.\nMoreover, it is not probable that another attempt upon his life will be\nmade inside our walls; and doubtless the main body of this gang are\nsomewhere without, intending to assault him when he continues his\njourney, and they have left but a spy or two here to inform them as to\nhis movements. I will give you any aid in my power, young sir. The army\nis by this time nigh Marseilles, and, sooth to say, I have no body of\nmen-at-arms whom I could send as your escort for so long a distance. I\nhave but a small body here, and they are needed, and sorely too, to keep\norder within the walls.\"\n\n\"I thought, sir,\" Cuthbert said, \"that if you could lend me a party of\nsay four men-at-arms to ride with me for the first day, I could then\ntrust to myself, especially if you could procure me one honest man to act\nas guide and companion. Doubtless they suppose that I should travel by\nthe main road south; but by going the first day's journey either east or\nwest, and then striking some southward road, I should get a fair start of\nthem, throw all their plans out, and perchance reach Marseilles without\ninterruption.\"\n\nThe knight willingly agreed to furnish four men-at-arms, and a\ntrustworthy guide who would at least take him as far south as Avignon.\n\n\"I will,\" he said, \"tell the men-at-arms off to-night. They shall be\nat the western gate at daybreak with the pass permitting them to ride\nthrough. The guide shall be at the convent door half an hour earlier.\nI will send up to-night your armour and horse. Here is a purse which\nthe Earl of Evesham also left for your use. Is there aught else I can\ndo for you?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" Cuthbert said; \"and if I regain the army in safety, I\nshall have pleasure in reporting to King Richard how kindly and\ncourteously you have treated me.\"\n\nThe arrangements were carried out.\n\nAn hour before daybreak Cuthbert was aroused, donned his armour and steel\ncasque, drank a flask of wine, and ate a manchet of bread which the\nprior himself brought him; and then, with a cordial adieu to the kind\nmonks, issued forth.\n\nThe guide had just reached the gate, and together they trotted down the\nnarrow streets to the west gate of the city, where four men-at-arms were\nawaiting them.\n\nThe gates were at once opened, and Cuthbert and his little troop\nsallied forth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE ATTACK.\n\n\nAll day they rode with their faces west, and before nightfall had made a\njourney of over forty miles. Then bestowing a largess upon the\nmen-at-arms, Cuthbert dismissed them, and took up his abode at a\nhostelry, his guide looking to the two horses.\n\nCuthbert was pleased with the appearance of the man who had been placed\nat his disposal. He was a young fellow of two-or-three-and-twenty, with\nan honest face. He was, he told Cuthbert, the son of a small farmer near\nAvignon; but having a fancy for trade, he had been apprenticed to a\nmaster smith. Having served his apprenticeship, he found that he had\nmistaken his vocation, and intended to return to the paternal vineyards.\n\nCuthbert calculated that he would make at least four days' journey to the\nsouth before he could meet with any dangers. Doubtless his exit from the\nconvent had been discovered, and the moment the gates of the city were\nopened the spy would have proceeded south to warn his comrades, and these\nwould doubtless have taken a road which at a distance would again take\nthem on to that by which Cuthbert would be now travelling. As, however,\nhe rode fast, and made long marches each day, he hoped that he might\nsucceed in distancing them. Unfortunately, upon the third day his horse\ncast his shoe, and no smith could be met with until the end of the day's\njourney. Consequently, but a short distance could be done, and this at a\nslow pace. Upon the fifth day after their first start they arrived at a\nsmall town.\n\nThe next morning, Cuthbert on rising found that his guide did not present\nhimself as usual. Making inquiries, he found that the young man had gone\nout the evening before, and had not returned. Extremely uneasy at the\ncircumstance, Cuthbert went to the city guard, thinking that perhaps his\nguide might have got drunk, and been shut up in the cells. No news,\nhowever, was to be obtained there, and after waiting some hours, feeling\nsure that some harm had befallen him, he gave notice to the authorities\nof his loss, and then, mounting his horse, and leaving some money with\nthe landlord of the hostelry to give to his guide in case the latter\nshould return, he started at mid-day by the southern road.\n\nHe felt sure now that he was overtaken, and determined to keep his eyes\nand faculties thoroughly on watch.\n\nThe roads in those days were mere tracks. Here and there a little\nvillage was to be met with; but the country was sparsely cultivated, and\ntravelling lonely work. Cuthbert rode fast, carefully avoiding all copses\nand small woods through which the road ran, by making a circuit round\nthem and coming on to it again on the other side.\n\nHis horse was an excellent one, the gift of the earl, and he had little\nfear, with his light weight, of being overtaken, if he could once leave\nhis enemies behind him.\n\nAt length he approached an extensive forest, which stretched for miles on\neither side.\n\nHalf a mile before he reached it the track divided.\n\nHe had for some little time eased his horse down to a walk, as he felt\nthat the wood would be the spot where he would in all probability be\nattacked, and he needed that his steed should be possessed of its\nutmost vigour.\n\nAt the spot where the track branched, a man in the guise of a mendicant\nwas sitting. He begged for alms, and Cuthbert threw him a small coin.\n\nA sudden thought struck him as he heard a rustling in the bushes near.\n\n\"Which is the nearest and best road to Avignon?\" he said.\n\n\"The right-hand road is the best and shortest,\" the beggar said. \"The\nother makes a long circuit, and leads through several marshes, which your\nhonour will find it hard to pass.\"\n\nCuthbert thanked him, and moved forward, still at a walk, along the\nright-hand road.\n\nWhen he had gone about 200 yards, and was hidden from the sight of the\nman he had left--the country being rough, and scattered with clumps of\nbushes--he halted, and, as he expected, heard the sound of horses' hoofs\ncoming on at full gallop along the other road.\n\n\"Your master must have thought me young indeed,\" he said, \"to try and\ncatch me with such a transparent trick as that. I do not suppose that\naccursed page has more than ten men with him, and doubtless has placed\nfive on each road. This fellow was placed here to see which track I would\nfollow, and has now gone to give the party on the left hand the news that\nI have taken this way. Had it not been for him I should have had to run\nthe gauntlet with four or five of my enemies. As it is, the path will\ndoubtless be clear.\"\n\nSo saying, he turned his horse, galloped back to the spot where the\ntracks separated, and then followed the left-hand route.\n\nAs he had hoped, he passed through the wood without incident or\ninterruption, and arrived safely that night at a small town, having seen\nno signs of his enemies.\n\nThe next day he started again early, and rode on until mid-day, when he\nhalted at a large village, at which was the only inn between the place\nfrom which he started and his destination. He declined the offer of the\nservant of the inn to take his horse round to the stable, telling the\nman to hold him outside the door and give him from a sieve a few\nhandfuls of grain.\n\nThen he entered the inn and ate a hearty meal. As he appeared at the\ndoor, he saw several men gathered near. With a single spring he threw\nhimself into the saddle, just as a rush forward was made by those\nstanding round. The man next to him sprang upon him, and endeavoured to\ndrag him from the saddle. Cuthbert drew the little dagger called a\nMisricorde from his belt, and plunged it into his throat. Then seizing\nthe short mace which hung at the saddle bow, he hurled it with all his\nforce full in the face of his enemy, the page of Sir Philip, who was\nrushing upon him sword in hand. The heavy weapon struck him fairly\nbetween the eyes, and with a cry he fell back, his face completely\nsmashed in by the blow, the sword which he held uplifted to strike flying\nfar through the air.\n\nCuthbert struck his spurs into his horse, and the animal dashed forward\nwith a bound, Cuthbert striking with his long sword at one or two men who\nmade a snatch at the reins. In another minute he was cantering out of\nthe village, convinced that he had killed the leader of his foes, and\nthat he was safe now to pursue the rest of his journey on to Marseilles.\n\nSo it turned out.\n\nWithout further incident, he travelled through the south of France, and\narrived at the great seaport. He speedily discovered the quarters in\nwhich the Earl of Evesham's contingent were encamped, and made towards\nthis without delay. As he entered a wild shout of joy was heard, and Cnut\nran forward with many gestures of delight.\n\n\"My dear Cuthbert, my dear Cuthbert!\" he exclaimed. \"Can it be true that\nyou have escaped? We all gave you up; and although I did my best, yet had\nyou not survived it I should never have forgiven myself, believing that I\nmight have somehow done better, and have saved you from the cut-throats\nwho attacked us.\"\n\n\"Thanks, thanks, my good Cnut,\" Cuthbert cried. \"I have been through a\ntime of peril, no doubt; but as you see, I am hale and well--better,\nmethinks than you are, for you look pale and ill; and I doubt not that\nthe wound which I received was a mere scratch to that which bore you\ndown. It sounded indeed like the blow of a smith's hammer upon an anvil.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, my steel cap saved my head somewhat,\" Cnut said, \"and the\nhead itself is none of the thinnest; but it tried it sorely, I confess.\nHowever, now that you are back I shall, doubt not, soon be as strong as\never I was. I think that fretting for your absence has kept me back more\nthan the inflammation from the wound itself--but there is the Earl at the\ndoor of his tent.\"\n\nThrough the foresters and retainers who had at Cnut's shout of joy\ncrowded up, Cuthbert made his way, shaking hands right and left with the\nmen, among whom he was greatly loved, for they regarded him as being in a\ngreat degree the cause of their having been freed from outlawry, and\nrestored to civil life again. The earl was really affected. As Cuthbert\nrode up he held out both arms, and as his page alighted he embraced him\nas a father.\n\n\"My dear Cuthbert!\" he exclaimed. \"What anxiety have we not suffered. Had\nyou been my own son, I could not have felt more your loss. We did not\ndoubt for an instant that you had fallen into the hands of some of the\nretainers of that villain Count; and from all we could learn, and from\nthe absence of any dead body by the side of that of Cnut, I imagined that\nyou must have been carried off. It was clear that your chance of life, if\nyou fell into the hands of that evil page, or his equally vile master,\nwas small indeed. The very day that Cnut was brought in, I visited the\nFrench camp, and accused him of having been the cause of your\ndisappearance and Cnut's wounds. He affected the greatest astonishment at\nthe charge. He had not, as he said, been out of the camp for two days. My\naccusation was unfounded and malicious, and I should answer this as well\nas the previous outrage, when the vow of the Crusaders to keep peace\namong themselves was at an end. Of course I had no means of proving what\nI said, or I would have gone direct to the king and charged him with the\noutrage. As it was I gained nothing by my pains. He has accompanied this\nFrench division to Genoa; but when we meet at Sicily, where the two\narmies are to rendezvous, I will bring the matter before the king, as the\nfact that his page was certainly concerned in it must be taken as showing\nthat he was the instigator.\"\n\n\"It would, my lord earl, be perhaps better,\" Cuthbert said, \"if I\nmight venture to advise, to leave the matter alone. No doubt the count\nwould say that he had discharged his page after the tournament, and\nthat the latter was only carrying out his private feud with me. We\nshould not be able to disprove the story, and should gain no\nsatisfaction by the matter.\"\n\nThe earl admitted the justice of Cuthbert's reasoning, but reserved to\nhimself the task of punishing the author of the outrage upon the first\nfitting opportunity.\n\nThere was a weary delay at Marseilles before the expedition set sail.\nThis was caused by the fact of the English fleet, which had been ordered\nto be there upon their arrival, failing to keep the agreement.\n\nThe words English fleet badly describe the vessels which were to carry\nthe English contingent to their destination. They were ships belonging to\nthe maritime nations of Italy--the Venetians, Genoese, Pisans, etc.; for\nEngland at that time had but few of her own, and these scarcely fitted\nfor the stormy navigation of the Bay of Biscay.\n\nKing Richard, impatient as ever of delay, at last lost his temper, and\nembarked on board a ship with a few of his chosen knights, and set sail\nby himself for Sicily, the point at which the two armies of the\nexpedition were to re-unite. A few days after his departure, the\nlong-looked-for fleet arrived, and a portion of the English host embarked\nat once, and set sail for Sicily, where they were to be landed, and the\nships were to return to fetch the remaining contingent.\n\nA sea voyage of this kind in those days was a serious matter. Long\nvoyages were rare, and troops were carried very much upon the principle\nof herrings; that is, were packed as close as they could be, without any\nreference to their comfort. As the voyages seldom lasted more than\ntwenty-four hours, this did not much matter, but during long voyages the\ndiscomforts, or as may be said sufferings, of the troops were\nconsiderable. So tightly packed were the galleys in which the English set\nsail from Marseilles, that there was no walking about. Every man slept\nwhere he sat, and considered himself lucky indeed if he could obtain room\nsufficient to stretch himself at full length. Most slept sitting against\nbulwarks or other supports. In the cabins, where the knights, their pages\nand squires, were placed, the crowding was of course less excessive, but\neven here the amount of space, which a subaltern travelling to India for\nthe first time now-a-days would grumble at, was considered amply\nsufficient for half-a-dozen knights of distinction. It was a week after\nsailing, when Cnut touched Cuthbert's arm as he came on deck one morning,\nand said,--\n\n\"Look, look, Cuthbert! that mountain standing up in the water has caught\nfire on the top. Did you ever see such a thing?\"\n\nThe soldiers crowded to the side of the vessel, in intense astonishment\nand no little awe. From the top of a lofty and rugged hill, rising almost\nstraight from the sea, flames were roaring up, smoke hung over the\nisland, and stones were thrown into the air and rattled down the side of\nthe hill, or fell into the sea with a splash.\n\n\"That is a fearsome sight,\" Cnut said, crossing himself.\n\n\"It looks as if it was the mouth of purgatory,\" exclaimed another,\nstanding by.\n\nCuthbert himself was amazed, for the instruction he had received from\nFather Francis was of too slight a nature to include the story of\nvolcanoes. A priest, however, who accompanied the ship in the character\nof leech and confessor, explained the nature of the phenomenon to his\nastonished listeners, and told them that over on the mainland was a\nmountain which at times vomited forth such masses of stones and of\nliquid rock that it had swallowed up and covered many great cities. There\nwas also, he told them, another mountain of the same sort, even more\nvast, on the island of Sicily itself; but that this had seldom, as far\nback as man could remember, done any great harm.\n\nSailing on, in another day they arrived off the coast of Sicily itself,\nand sailing up the straits between it and the mainland, they landed at\nMessina. Here a considerable portion of the French army had already\narrived, having been brought down from Genoa.\n\nThere was no news of the King of England; and, as often happens, the\nsaying \"the more haste the less speed,\" had been verified here.\n\nIt was some days later before King Richard arrived, having been driven\nfrom his course by tempests, well-nigh cast ashore, and having besides\ngone through many adventures. Three weeks later, the whole of the army of\nthe Crusaders were gathered around Messina, where it was intended to\nremain some little time before starting. It was a gay time; and the\nkings vied with each other in entertainments, joustings, and tournaments.\nThe Italian knights also made a brave show, and it might have been\nthought that this huge army of men were gathered there simply for\namusement and feasting. In the tournaments every effort was made to\nprevent any feeling of national rivalry, and although parties of knights\nheld their own against all comers, these were most carefully selected to\nrepresent several nationalities, and therefore victory, on whichsoever\nside it fell, excited no feelings of bitterness.\n\nAlone, King Richard was undoubtedly the strongest cavalier of the two\narmies. Against his ponderous strength no knight could keep his seat; and\nthis was so palpable, that after many victories, King Richard was forced\nto retire from the lists from want of competitors, and to take his place\non the dais with the more peace-loving King of France.\n\nThe gaiety of the camp was heightened by the arrival of many nobles and\ndames from Italy. Here, too, came the Queen of Navarre, bringing with her\nthe beautiful Princess Berengaria.\n\n\"Methinks,\" the Earl of Evesham said to Cuthbert, a fortnight after the\narrival of the queen, \"that unless my eyes deceive me, the princess is\nlikely to be a cause of trouble.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" asked Cuthbert with surprise, for he had been struck with\nher marvellous beauty, and wondered greatly what mischief so fair a\nbeing could do.\n\n\"By the way in which our good lord, the king, gazes upon her, methinks\nthat it were like enough that he broke off his engagement with the\nPrincess of France, for the sake of the fair eyes of this damsel.\"\n\n\"That were indeed a misfortune,\" Cuthbert said gravely, for he saw at\nonce the anger which such a course would excite in the minds of the\nFrench king and his knights, who would naturally be indignant in the\nextreme at the slight put upon their princess. As day after day passed,\nit became evident to all that the King of England was infatuated by the\nprincess. Again he entered the lists himself, and as some fresh Italian\nknights and others had arrived, he found fresh opponents, and\nconspicuously laid the spoils of victory at the feet of the princess,\nwhom he selected as the Queen of Beauty.\n\nAll sorts of rumours now became current in camp; violent quarrels between\nthe kings, and bad feeling between the French and English knights, broke\nout again in consequence, and this more violently than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE PRINCESS BERENGARIA.\n\n\nOne night it chanced that Cuthbert was late in his return to camp, and\nhis road took him through a portion of the French encampment; the night\nwas dark, and Cuthbert presently completely lost all idea as to his\nbearings. Presently he nearly ran against a tent; he made his way to the\nentrance in order to crave directions as to his way--for it was a wet\nnight; the rain was pouring in torrents, and few were about of whom he\ncould demand the way--and, as he was about to draw aside the hangings, he\nheard words said in a passionate voice which caused him to withdraw his\nhand suddenly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said a voice, \"I would rather drive a dagger myself into\nher heart, than allow our own princess to be insulted by this hot-headed\nisland dog.\"\n\n\"It is sad indeed,\" said another, but in a calmer and smoother tone,\n\"that the success of a great expedition like this, which has for its\nobject the recovery of the holy sepulchre from the infidels, should be\nwrecked by the headstrong fancies of one man. It is even, as is told by\nthe old Grecian poet, as when Helen caused a great war between peoples of\nthat nation.\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" another voice said, \"either of Helen or the Greeks, or\nof their poets. They are a shifty race, and I can believe aught that is\nbad of them. But touching this princess of Navarre, I agree with our\nfriend, it would be a righteous deed to poniard her, and so to remove the\ncause of dispute between the two kings, and, indeed, the two nations.\nThis insult laid upon our princess is more than we, as French knights and\ngentlemen, can brook; and if the king says the word, there is not a\ngentleman in the army but will be ready to turn his sword against the\nislanders.\"\n\nThen the smooth voice spoke again.\n\n\"It would, my brethren, be wrong and useless to shed blood; but methinks,\nthat if this apple of discord could be removed, a good work would be\ndone; not, as our friend the count has suggested, by a stab of the\ndagger; that indeed would be worse than useless. But surely there are\nscores of religious houses, where this bird might be placed in a cage\nwithout a soul knowing where she was, and where she might pass her life\nin prayer that she may be pardoned for having caused grave hazards of the\nfailure of an enterprise in which all the Christian world is concerned.\"\n\nThe voices of the speakers now fell, and Cuthbert was straining his ear\nto listen, when he heard footsteps approaching the tent, and he glided\naway into the darkness.\n\nWith great difficulty he recovered the road to the camp, and when he\nreached his tent he confided to the Earl of Evesham what he had heard.\n\n\"This is serious indeed,\" the earl said, \"and bodes no little trouble\nand danger. It is true that the passion which King Richard has conceived\nfor Berengaria bids fair to wreck the Crusade, by the anger which it has\nexcited in the French king and his nobles; but the disappearance of the\nprincess would no less fatally interfere with it, for the king would be\nlike a raging lion deprived of his whelps, and would certainly move no\nfoot eastward until he had exhausted all the means in his power of\ntracing his lost lady love. You could not, I suppose, Cuthbert, point out\nthe tent where this conversation took place?\"\n\n\"I could not,\" Cuthbert answered; \"in the darkness one tent is like\nanother. I think I should recognize the voices of the speakers did I hear\nthem again; indeed, one voice I did recognize, it was that of the Count\nof Brabant, with whom we had trouble before.\"\n\n\"That is good,\" the earl said, \"because we have at least an object to\nwatch. It would never do to tell the king what you have heard. In the\nfirst place, his anger would be so great that it would burst all\nbounds, and would cause, likely enough, a battle at once between the\ntwo armies; nor would it have any good effect, for he of Brabant would\nof course deny the truth of your assertions, and would declare it was\nmerely a got-up story to discredit him with the king, and so to wipe\nout the old score now standing between us. No, if we are to succeed,\nalike in preventing harm happening to the princess, and an open break\nbetween the two monarchs, it must be done by keeping a guard over the\nprincess, unsuspected by all, and ourselves frustrating any attempt\nwhich may be made.\"\n\nCuthbert expressed his willingness to carry out the instructions which\nthe earl might give him; and, much disturbed by the events of the day,\nboth earl and page retired to rest, to think over what plan had best\nbe adopted.\n\nThe princess was staying at the palace of the bishop of the town; this\nhe, having another residence a short distance outside the walls, had\nplaced at the disposal of the Queen of Navarre and her suite; and the\nfirst step of Cuthbert in the morning was to go into the town, to\nreconnoitre the position and appearance of the building. It was a large\nand irregular pile, and communicated with the two monasteries lying\nalongside of it. It would therefore clearly be a most difficult thing to\nkeep up a complete watch on the exterior of so large a building. There\nwere so many ways in which the princess might be captured and carried off\nby unscrupulous men, that Cuthbert in vain thought over every plan by\nwhich it could be possible to safeguard her. She might be seized upon\nreturning from a tournament or entertainment; but this was improbable, as\nthe queen would always have an escort of knights with her, and no attempt\ncould be successful except at the cost of a public fracas and much loss\nof blood. Cuthbert regarded as out of the question that an outrage of\nthis kind would be attempted.\n\nThe fact that one of the speakers in the tent had used the words \"my\nsons,\" showed that one priest or monk, at least, was connected with the\nplot. It was possible that this man might have power in one of the\nmonasteries, or he might be an agent of the bishop himself; and\nCuthbert saw that it would be easy enough in the night for a party from\none or other of the monasteries to enter by the door of communication\nwith the palace, and carry off the princess without the slightest alarm\nbeing given. Once within the walls of the convent, she could be either\nhidden in the dungeons or secret places, which buildings of that kind\nwere sure to possess, or could be at once carried out by some quiet\nentrance, and taken into the country, or transferred to some other\nbuilding in the town.\n\nWhen Cuthbert joined the earl he told him the observations that he had\nmade, and Sir Walter praised the judgment which he had shown in his\nconclusions. The earl was of opinion that it would be absolutely\nnecessary to get some clue as to the course which the abductors purposed\nto take; indeed it was possible that on after-consideration they might\ndrop their plan altogether, for the words which Cuthbert had overheard\nscarcely betokened a plan completely formed and finally decided upon.\n\nThe great point he considered, therefore, was that the tent of his old\nenemy should be carefully watched, and that an endeavour should be made\nto hear something of what passed within, which might give a clue to the\nplan fixed upon. They did not, of course, know whether the tent in\nwhich the conversation had been heard by Cuthbert was that of Sir de\nJacquelin Barras, or of one of the other persons who had spoken; and\nCuthbert suggested that the first thing would be to find out whether\nthe count, after nightfall, was in the habit of going to some other\ntent, or whether, on the other hand, he remained within, and was\nvisited by others.\n\nIt was easy, of course, to discover which was his tent; and Cuthbert soon\ngot its position, and then took Cnut into his counsels.\n\n\"The matter is difficult,\" Cnut said, \"and I see no way by which a watch\ncan be kept up by day; but after dark--I have several men in my band who\ncan track a deer, and surely could manage to follow the steps of this\nbaron without being observed. There is little Jack, who is no bigger than\na boy of twelve, although he can shoot, and run, and play with the\nquarter-staff, or, if need be, with the bill, against the best man in the\ntroop. I warrant me that if you show him the tent, he will keep such\nsharp watch that no one shall enter or depart without his knowing where\nthey go to. On a dark night he will be able to slip among the tents, and\nto move here and there without being seen. He can creep on his stomach\nwithout moving a leaf, and trust me the eyes of these French men-at-arms\nwill look in vain for a glimpse of him.\"\n\n\"You understand, Cnut, all that I want to know is whether the\nother conspirators in this matter visit his tent, or whether he\ngoes to theirs.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Cnut said. \"That is the first point to be arrived at.\"\n\nThree days later Cnut brought news that each night after dark a party of\nfive men met in the tent that was watched; that one of the five always\ncame out when all had assembled, and took his station before the entrance\nof the tent, so as to be sure that no eavesdropper was near.\n\nCuthbert smiled,--\n\n\"It is a case of locking the door after the horse has gone.\"\n\n\"What is to be done now?\" Cnut asked.\n\n\"I will talk with the earl before I tell you, Cnut. This matter is too\nserious for me to take a step without consulting Sir Walter.\"\n\nThat night there was a long talk between the earl and his page as to the\nbest course to be pursued. It was clear that their old enemy was the\nleading person in the plot, and that the only plan to baffle it with any\nfair chances of success was to keep a constant eye upon his movements,\nand also to have three or four of the sturdiest men of the band told off\nto watch, without being perceived, each time that the princess was in\nher palace.\n\nThe Earl of Evesham left the arrangements entirely in the hands of his\npage, of whose good sense and sagacity he had a very high opinion.\n\nHis own first impulse had been to go before the king and denounce the\nCount of Brabant. But the ill-will between them was already well known;\nfor not only was there the original dispute at the banquet, but when the\ntwo armies had joined at Sicily, King Richard, who had heard from the\nearl of the attempt at the assassination of Cuthbert, had laid a\ncomplaint before King Phillip of the conduct of his subject.\n\nSir de Jacquelin Barras, however, had denied that he had any finger in\nthe matter.\n\n\"He had,\" he said, \"discharged his page after the encounter with\nCuthbert, and knew nothing further whatever of his movements.\"\n\nAlthough it was morally certain that the page could not have purchased\nthe services of the men who assisted him, from his own purse, or gain\nthem by any means of persuasion, but that they were either the followers\nof the Count of Brabant, or ruffians hired with his money, as no proof\ncould be obtained, the matter was allowed to drop.\n\nThe earl felt, however, that an accusation against the count by him of an\nintention to commit a high crime, and this merely on the evidence of his\npage, would appear like an attempt to injure the fair fame of his rival.\n\nFeeling, therefore, that nothing could be done save to watch, he left\nthe matter entirely in the hands of his page, telling him that he\ncould take as many men-at-arms or archers as he might choose and use\nthem in his name.\n\nCnut entered warmly into Cuthbert's plans; and finally it was arranged\nbetween them that six of the archers should nightly keep watch opposite\nthe various entrances of the bishop's palace and of the two monasteries\njoining. Of course they could not patrol up and down without attracting\nattention, but they were to take up posts where they could closely\nobserve the entrances, and were either to lie down and feign drunken\nsleep, or to conceal themselves within the shadow of an arch or other\nhiding-place.\n\nDown on the sea-shore, Cuthbert made an arrangement with one of the\nowners of small craft lying there that ten of his men should sleep on\nboard every night, together with some fishermen accustomed to the use\nof the oar.\n\nCuthbert himself determined to be always with this party.\n\nNight after night passed, and so long a time went by that Cuthbert began\nto think the design must have been given up.\n\nHowever, he resolved to relax none of his watchfulness during the\nremaining time that the expedition might stop in Sicily.\n\nIt was in January, three weeks after the first watch had been set, when\none of the men who had been placed to watch the entrance to one of the\nmonasteries, leapt on board the craft and shook Cuthbert by the shoulder.\n\n\"A party of some five men,\" he said, \"have just issued out from the\nmonastery. They are bearing a burden--what, I cannot see. They were\nmaking in the direction of the water. I whistled to Dick, who was\nnext to me in the lane. He is following them, and I came on to tell\nyou to prepare.\"\n\nThe night was pitch dark, and it was difficult in the extreme to see any\none moving at a short distance off.\n\nThere were two or three streets that led from the monastery, which stood\nat the top of the town, towards the sea; and a party coming down might\ntake any of these, according to the position in which the boat they were\nseeking was placed.\n\nCuthbert now instantly sent five or six of his men, with instructions to\navoid all noise, along the line of the port, with orders to bring in\nword should any one come down and take boat, or should they hear any\nnoise in the town.\n\nHe himself with the sailors loosed the ropes which fastened the boat to\nshore, got out the oars, and prepared to put off at a moment's notice.\n\nHe was of course ignorant whether the abductors would try to carry the\nprincess off by water, or would hide her in one of the convents of the\ntown; but he was inclined to think that the former would be the course\nadopted; for the king in his wrath would be ready to lay the town in\nflames, and to search every convent from top to bottom for the princess.\nBesides, there would be too many aware of the secret.\n\nCuthbert was not wrong in his supposition.\n\nSoon the man he had sent to the extreme right came running up with the\nnews that a boat had embarked at the farther end, with a party of some\nten men on board. As he came along he had warned the others, and in five\nminutes the whole party were collected in the craft, numbering in all\ntwelve of Cuthbert's men and six sailors. They instantly put out, and\nrowed in the direction in which the boat would have gone, the boatmen\nexpressing their opinion that probably the party would make for a vessel\nwhich was lying anchored at some little distance from shore. The bearings\nof the position of this ship was known to the boatmen, but the night was\nso dark that they were quite unable to find it. Orders had been given\nthat no sound or whisper was to be heard on board the boat; and after\nrowing as far as they could, the boatmen said they were in the direction\nof the ship.\n\nThe boatmen all lay on their oars, and all listened intently.\nPresently the creaking of a pulley was heard in the still night, at a\ndistance of a few hundred yards. This was enough. It was clear that\nthe vessel was getting up sail. The boat's head was turned in that\ndirection; the crew rowed steadily but noiselessly, and in a few\nminutes the tall mast of a vessel could be seen faintly against the\nsky. Just as they perceived the situation, a hail from on board showed\nthat their approach was now observed.\n\n\"Stretch to your oars,\" Cuthbert said, \"we must make a dash for it now.\"\n\nThe rowers bent to their work and in a minute the boat ran alongside\nthe craft.\n\nAs Cuthbert and his followers scrambled upon the deck, they were attacked\nby those of the crew and passengers who were standing near; but it was\nevident at once that the chiefs of the expedition had not heard the hail,\nand that there was no general plan of defence against them.\n\nIt was not until the last of them had gained a footing, and were\nbeginning to fight their way along the vessel, that from below three or\nfour men-at-arms ran up, and one in a tone of authority demanded what was\nthe matter. When he heard the clash of swords and the shouts of the\ncombatants, he put himself at once at the head of the party, and a fierce\nand obstinate fight now took place.\n\nThe assailants had, however, the advantage.\n\nCuthbert and his men were all lightly clad, and this on the deck of a\nship lumbered with ropes and gear, and in the dark, was a great\nadvantage, for the mailed men-at-arms frequently stumbled and fell. The\nfight lasted for several minutes. Cnut who was armed with a heavy mace,\ndid great service, for with each of his sweeping blows he broke down the\nguard of an opponent, and generally levelled him to the deck.\n\nThe numbers at the beginning of the fight were not unequal, but the men\nto whom the vessel belonged made but a faint resistance when they\nperceived that the day was going against them. The men-at-arms, however,\nconsisting of three, who appeared to be the leaders, and of eight\npikemen, fought stubbornly and well.\n\nCuthbert was not long in detecting in the tones of the man who was\nclearly at the head of affairs the voice of Sir de Jacquelin Barras. To\ndo him justice he fought with extreme bravery, and when almost all his\nfollowers were cut down or beaten overboard, he resisted staunchly and\nwell. With a heavy two-handed sword he cleaved a space at the end of the\nboat, and kept the whole of Cuthbert's party at bay.\n\nAt last Cnut, who had been engaged elsewhere, came to the front, and a\ntough fight ensued between them.\n\nIt might have ended badly for the brave forester, for his lack of armour\ngave an enormous advantage to his opponent. Soon, however, the count's\nfoot slipped on the boards of the deck, and before he could recover\nhimself the mace of Cnut descended with tremendous force upon his head,\nwhich was unprotected, as he had taken off his casque on arriving at the\nship. Without a word or a cry the count fell forward on the deck, killed\nas a bullock by a blow of a pole-axe.\n\nWhile this conflict had been going on, occasionally the loud screams of a\nwoman had been heard below.\n\nCuthbert, attended by Cnut and two of his followers, now descended.\n\nAt the bottom of the steps they found a man-at-arms placed at the\ndoor of a cabin. He challenged them as they approached, but being\nspeedily convinced that the vessel was in their hands, and that his\nemployer and party were all conquered, he made a virtue of necessity,\nand laid down his arms.\n\n\"You had better go in alone,\" Cnut said, \"Master Cuthbert. The lady is\nless likely to be frightened by your appearance than by us, for she must\nwonder indeed what is going on.\"\n\nOn entering the cabin, which had evidently been fitted up for the use of\na lady, Cuthbert saw standing at the other end the princess whom of\ncourse he knew well by sight. A lamp was burning in the cabin, and by its\nlight he could see that her face was deadly pale. Her robes were torn and\ndisarranged, and she wore a look at once of grave alarm and surprise upon\nseeing a handsomely dressed page enter with a deep reverence.\n\n\"What means this outrage, young sir? Whoever you be, I warn you that the\nKing of England will revenge this indignity.\"\n\n\"Your Highness,\" Cuthbert said, \"you have no further reason for alarm;\nthe knaves who carried you off from the bishop's palace and conveyed you\nto this ship are all either killed or in our power. I am the page of the\nEarl of Evesham, a devoted follower of King Richard. Some of the designs\nof the bold men came to the ears of my lord, and he ordered me and a band\nof his followers to keep good guard over the palace and buildings\nadjoining. We were unable to gather our strength in time to prevent your\nbeing taken on board, but we lost no time in putting forth when we found\nthat your abductors had taken boat, and by good fortune arrived here in\ntime; a few minutes later, and the knaves would have succeeded in their\nobject, for the sails were already being hoisted, and the vessel making\nway, when we arrived. Your abductors are all either killed or thrown\noverboard, and the vessel's head is now turned towards the shore, and I\nhope in a few minutes to have the honour of escorting you to the palace.\"\n\nThe princess, with a sigh of much satisfaction and relief, sank on\nto a couch.\n\n\"I am indeed indebted to you, young sir,\" she said. \"Believe me, the\nPrincess Berengaria is not ungrateful, and should it be ever in her power\nto do aught for your lord, or for yourself, or for those who have\naccompanied you to rescue her, believe me that she will do it.\"\n\n\"May I be so bold as to ask a boon?\" Cuthbert said, dropping on one knee\nbefore her.\n\n\"It is granted at once, whatever it be, if in my power.\"\n\n\"My boon is, lady,\" he said, \"that you will do your best to assuage the\nnatural anger which the King of England will feel at this bold and most\nviolent attempt. That he should be told, is of course necessary; but,\nlady, much depends upon the telling, and I am sure that at your request\nthe king would restrain his anger. Were it not for that, I fear that such\nquarrels and disputes might arise as would bring the two armies to blows,\nand destroy for ever all hope of the successful termination of our joint\nenterprise.\"\n\n\"You are a wise and good youth,\" the princess said, holding out her hand\nto Cuthbert, which, as in duty bound, he placed to his lips. \"Your\nrequest is wise and most thoughtful. I will use any poor influence which\nI may possess\"--and Cuthbert could see that the blood came back now to\nthe white face--\"to induce King Richard to allow this matter to pass\nover. There is no reason why he should take up the case. I am no more\nunder his protection than under that of the King of France, and it is to\nthe latter I should appeal, for as I believe the men who abducted me were\nhis subjects.\"\n\n\"The leader of them, madam, was a certain Sir de Jacquelin Barras, a\nCount of Brabant, with whom my master has had an old feud, and who has\nbeen just killed by the leader of our men-at-arms. The others, who have\nhad the most active hand in the matter, have also perished; and it would,\nI think, be doubtful whether any clue could be obtained to those who were\nin league with them. The only man in the party who is alive, was placed\nas a sentry at your door, and as he is but a man-at-arms, we may be sure\nthat he knows nought of the enterprise, but has merely carried out the\norders of his master.\"\n\nThe vessel had by this time brought up close to the port. The princess\ndetermined to wait on board until the first dawn was seen in the skies,\nand then under the escort of her deliverers to go back to the palace,\nbefore the town was moving. This plan was carried out, and soon after\ndawn the princess was safe in the palace from which she had been carried\na few hours previously.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. PIRATES.\n\n\nIt was not possible that a matter of this sort could be entirely hushed\nup. Not many hours passed before rumours were current of events which had\ntaken place, though none knew what those events were.\n\nThere were reports that the tire-woman of the Princess Berengaria had in\nthe night discovered that her mistress's couch was unoccupied, that she\nhad found signs of a struggle, and had picked up a dagger on the floor,\nwhere it had evidently fallen from the sheath; also it was said, that the\nprincess had returned at daylight escorted by an armed party, and that\nshe was unable to obtain entrance to the palace until one of the ladies\nof the queen had been fetched down to order the sentries at the gate to\nallow her to enter.\n\nThis was the news which rumour carried through the camp. Few, however,\nbelieved it, and none who could have enlightened them opened their lips\nupon the subject.\n\nIt was known, however, that a messenger had come to King Richard early,\nand that he had at once mounted, and ridden off to the bishop's palace.\nWhat had happened there none could say, but there were rumours that his\nvoice had been heard in furious outbursts of passion. He remained there\nuntil the afternoon, when he sent for a number of his principal nobles.\n\nWhen these arrived, they found him standing on a daïs in the principal\nhall of the palace, and he there formally introduced to them the Princess\nBerengaria as his affianced wife. The ceremony of the marriage, he told\nthem, would shortly take place.\n\nThis announcement caused a tremendous stir in both armies. The English,\nwho had never been favourable to the alliance with the French princess,\nwere glad to hear that this was broken off, and were well content that\nthe Princess Berengaria should be their future queen, for her beauty,\nhigh spirit, and kindness had won all hearts.\n\nOn the part of the French, on the other hand, there was great\nindignation, and for some time it was feared that the armies would come\nto open blows.\n\nKing Phillip, however, although much angered, was politic enough to\ndeprecate any open outbreak. He knew that a dispute now began, would not\nonly at once put a stop to the Crusade, but that it might lead to more\nserious consequences at home. The fiery bravery of the English king,\nbacked as it would be by the whole strength of his subjects, might render\nhim a very formidable opponent; and the king felt that private grievances\nmust be laid aside where the good of France was concerned.\n\nStill the coldness between the armies increased, their camps were moved\nfurther apart, and during the time that they remained in Sicily, there\nwas but little commerce between the two forces.\n\nAs soon as the winter had broken, the French monarch broke up his camp,\nand in March sailed for the Holy Land.\n\nThe English had expected that the marriage ceremony of the king and\nPrincess Berengaria would be celebrated before they left Sicily, but this\nwas not the case. There were high joustings and fetes in honour of the\nprincess, but the marriage was delayed. A fortnight after the French had\nsailed, the English embarked in the 200 ships, which had been prepared,\nand sailed also on their way to Acre.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the attempted abduction of the Princess\nBerengaria was unimportant in its results to Cuthbert.\n\nAfter returning from the palace the king, who had heard from her the\ndetails of what had taken place, and the names of her rescuers, sent for\nthe Earl of Evesham. The latter had of course learned from Cuthbert all\nthat had happened, and had expressed his high approval of his conduct,\nand his gratification at the result.\n\n\"I learn, Sir Earl,\" said King Richard, \"that it is to you that I am\nindebted for the rescue of the princess. She tells me, that suspecting\nsome plot, you placed a guard around the bishop's palace, with a strong\nbody on the shore ready to rescue her from the hands of any who might\nattempt to take her to sea.\"\n\n\"It is as you say, sire,\" replied the earl; \"but the whole merit of the\naffair rests upon my page, the lad whom you may remember as having fought\nwith and conquered the French page, and of whose conduct you then\napproved highly. You may also remember that he escaped by some display of\nbravery and shrewdness the further attempts to assassinate him, and your\nMajesty was good enough to make a complaint to King Phillip of the\nconduct of one of his nobles on that head. It seems that some two months\nsince, the lad in coming through the French camp at night missed his way,\nand accidentally overheard a few words spoken in a voice which he\nrecognized as that of his enemy. The name of your Majesty being\nmentioned, he deemed it his duty to listen, and thus discovered that a\nplot was on foot for carrying off the princess. After consultation with\nme, we agreed upon the course to be adopted, namely, to place sentries\nround the bishop's palace and the buildings adjoining, who should follow\nand bring word should she be taken to another place in town, while a band\nwas placed on the shore in readiness to interfere at once to prevent her\nbeing carried away by sea. He undertook the management of all details,\nhaving with him a trusty squire who commands my Saxon bowmen.\"\n\n\"For your own part I thank you, my lord,\" the king said, \"and, believe\nme, you shall not find Richard ungrateful. As to your page, he appears\nbrave and wise beyond his years. Were it not that I think that it would\nnot be good for him, and might attract some envy upon the part of\nothers, I would at once make him a knight. He already has my promise\nthat I will do so on the first occasion when he can show his prowess\nupon the infidels. Bring him to me to-morrow, when the princess will be\nhere with the Queen of Navarre at a banquet. I would fain thank him\nbefore her; and, although I have agreed--at the princess's earnest\nsolicitation--to take no further notice of the matter, and to allow it\nto pass as if it had not been, yet I cannot forgive the treachery which\nhas been used, and, without letting all know exactly what has occurred,\nwould fain by my reception of your page, let men see that something of\ngreat import has happened, of the nature of which I doubt not that\nrumour will give some notion.\"\n\nUpon the following day, therefore, Cuthbert to his confusion found\nhimself the centre of the royal circle. The king expressed himself to him\nin the most gracious manner, patting him on the shoulder, and said that\nhe would be one day one of the best and bravest of his knights. The\nprincess and the Queen of Navarre gave him their hands to kiss; and\nsomewhat overwhelmed, he withdrew from the royal presence, the centre of\nattention, and, in some minds, of envy.\n\nCnut too did not pass unrewarded.\n\nHis Majesty, finding that Cnut was of gentle Saxon blood, gave him a gold\nchain in token of his favour, and distributed a heavy purse among the men\nwho had followed him.\n\nWhen the British fleet, numbering 200 ships, set sail from Sicily, it was\na grand and martial sight. From the masts were the colours of England and\nthose of the nobles who commanded; while the pennons of the knights, the\nbright plumes and mantles, the flash of armour and arms, made the decks\nalive with light and colour.\n\nThe king's ship advanced in the van, and round him were the vessels\ncontaining his principal followers. The Queen of Navarre and the\nPrincess Berengaria were with the fleet. Strains of music rose from the\nwaters, and never were the circumstances of war exhibited in a more\npicturesque form.\n\nFor two days the expedition sailed on, and then a change of a sudden and\ndisastrous kind took place.\n\n\"What is all this bustle about?\" Cuthbert said to Cnut. \"The sailors are\nrunning up the ladders, and all seems confusion.\"\n\n\"Methinks,\" said Cnut, \"that we are about to have a storm. A few minutes\nago scarce a cloud was to be seen; now that bank over there has risen\nhalf-way up the sky. The sailors are accustomed to these treacherous\nseas, and the warnings which we have not noticed have no doubt been clear\nenough to them.\" With great rapidity the sails of the fleet came down,\nand in five minutes its whole aspect was changed; but quickly as the\nsailors had done their work, the storm was even more rapid in its\nprogress. Some of the ships whose crews were slower or less skilful than\nthe others, were caught by the gale before they could get their sails\nsnug, and the great sheets of white canvas were blown from the bolt ropes\nas if made of paper, and a blackness which could almost be felt, covered\nthe sea, the only light being that given by the frothing waters. There\nwas no longer any thought of order. Each ship had to shift for herself;\nand each captain to do his best to save those under his charge, without\nthought of what might befall the others.\n\nIn the ship which carried the Earl of Evesham's contingent, order and\ndiscipline prevailed. The earl's voice had been heard at the first puff\nof wind, shouting to the men to go below, save a few who might be of use\nto haul at ropes. His standard was lowered, the bright flags removed from\nthe sides of the ship, the shields which were hanging over the bulwarks\nwere hurriedly taken below, and when the gale smote them, the ship was\ntrim, and in readiness to receive it. A few square yards of sail alone\nwere all that the captain had thought it prudent to keep spread, and in a\nminute from the time she was struck the lofty hulk was tearing along\nthrough the waters at a tremendous speed. Four of the best hands were\nplaced at the helm; and here the captain took his post.\n\nThe danger was now that in the darkness they might run against one of\ntheir consorts. Even in the war of the elements they could hear from time\nto time crashes as of vessels striking against each other, with shouts\nand cries. Once or twice from the darkness ships emerged, close on one\nhand or the other; but the steadiness of the captain in each case saved\nthe ship from collision.\n\nAs the storm continued, these glimpses of other vessels became more and\nmore rare, and the ship being a very fast sailer, the captain indulged\nthe hope that he was now clear of the rest of the fleet.\n\nHe now attempted to lie-to to the storm, but the wind was too strong.\nThe ships in those days too, were so high out of the water, and offered\nin themselves such a target to the wind, that it was useless to adopt any\nother maneuver than to run before it.\n\nFor two days and nights the tempest raged.\n\n\"What think you,\" the earl said to the captain, \"of our position? Where\nare we, and where will the course upon which we are running take us?\"\n\n\"I cannot say with certainty,\" the captain said, \"for the wind has\nshifted several times. I had hoped to gain the shelter of Rhodes, but a\nshift of wind bore us away from there, and I much fear that from the\ndirection in which we have been running we must be very nigh on the coast\nof Africa.\"\n\n\"Pest!\" the earl said. \"That would indeed be a speedy end to our Crusade.\nThese Moors are pirates and cut-throats to a man; and even should we\navoid the risk of being dashed to pieces, we should end our lives as\nslaves to one of these black infidels.\"\n\nThree hours later, the captain's prophecies turned out right. Breakers\nwere seen in various points in front, and with the greatest difficulty\nthe vessel was steered through an opening between them; but in another\nfew minutes she struck heavily, one of her masts went over the side,\nand she lay fast and immovable. Fortunately, the outside bank of sand\nacted as a sort of breakwater; had she struck upon this, the good ship\nwould have gone to pieces instantly; but although the waves still\nstruck her with considerable force, the captain had good hope that she\nwould not break up. Darkness came on; the tempest seemed to lull. As\nthere was no immediate danger, and all were exhausted by the tossing\nwhich they had received during the last forty-eight hours, the crew of\nthe \"Rose\" slept soundly.\n\nIn the morning the sun rose brilliantly, and there was no sign of the\ngreat storm which had scattered the fleet of England. The shore was to be\nseen at a distance of some four miles, It was low and sandy, with lofty\nmountains in the distance. Far inland a white town with minaret and dome\ncould be seen.\n\n\"Know you where we are?\" the earl asked.\n\n\"As far as I can tell,\" the captain said, \"we have been driven up the bay\ncalled the Little Syrtis--a place full of shoals and shallows, and\nabounding with pirates of the worst kind.\"\n\n\"Think you that the ship has suffered injury?\"\n\n\"Whether she has done so or not,\" the captain said, \"I fear greatly that\nshe is fast in the sand, and even the lightening of all her cargo will\nscarce get her off; but we must try at least.\"\n\n\"It is little time that we shall have to try, Master Captain,\" Cuthbert,\nwho was standing close, said. \"Methinks those two long ships which are\nputting out from that town will have something to say to that.\"\n\n\"It is too true,\" the captain said. \"Those are the galleys of the Moorish\ncorsairs. They are thirty or forty oars, draw but little water, and will\nbe here like the wind.\"\n\n\"What do you advise?\" asked the earl. \"The balistas which you have upon\nthe poop can make but a poor resistance to boats that can row around us,\nand are no doubt furnished with heavy machines. They will quickly\nperceive that we are aground and defenceless, and will be able to plump\ntheir bolts into us until they have knocked the good ship to pieces.\nHowever, we will fight to the last. It shall not be said that the Earl of\nEvesham was taken by infidel dogs and sold as a slave, without striking a\nblow in his defence.\"\n\nCuthbert stood watching the corsairs, which were now rowing towards them\nat all speed.\n\n\"Methinks, my lord,\" he said, presently, \"if I might venture to give an\nopinion, that we might yet trick the infidel.\"\n\n\"As how, Cuthbert?\" the earl said. \"Speak out; you know that I have great\nfaith in your sagacity.\"\n\n\"I think, sir,\" the page said, \"that did we send all your men below,\nleaving only the crew of the vessel on deck, they would take us for a\nmerchant ship which has been wrecked here, and exercise but little care\nhow they approach us. The men on deck might make a show of shooting once\nor twice with the balistas. The pirates, disdaining such a foe, would row\nalongside. Once there, we might fasten one or both to our side with\ngrapnels, and then, methinks, that English bill and bow will render us\nmore than a match for Moorish pirates, and one of these craft can\nscarcely carry more men than we have. I should propose to take one of\nthem by force, and drive the pirates overboard; take possession of, if\npossible, or beat off, her consort; and then take the most valuable\nstores from the ship, and make our way as best we can to the north.\"\n\n\"Well thought of!\" exclaimed the earl, cordially. \"You have indeed\nimagined a plan which promises well. What think you, captain?\"\n\n\"I think, my lord,\" the Genoese said, \"that the plan is an excellent one,\nand promises every success. If your men will all go below, holding their\narms in readiness for the signal, mine shall prepare grapnels and ropes,\nand the first of these craft which comes alongside they will lash so\nsecurely to the \"Rose\" that I warrant me she gets not away.\"\n\nThese preparations were soon made.\n\nThe soldiers, who at first had been filled with apprehension at the\nthought of slavery among the infidels, were now delighted at the prospect\nof a struggle ending in escape.\n\nThe archers prepared their bows and arrows, and stood behind the\nport-holes in readiness to pour a volley into the enemy; the men-at-arms\ngrasped their pikes and swords; while above, the sailors moved hither and\nthither as if making preparations for defence, but in reality preparing\nthe grapnels and ropes.\n\nOne of the pirates was faster than the other, and soon coming within\nreach, poured flights of javelins and stones upon the \"Rose\" from\npowerful machines, which she carried in her bow.\n\nThe crew of the \"Rose\" replied with their crossbows and arrows\nfrom the poop.\n\nThe corsair at first did not keep her course direct for the ship, but\nrowed round her, shooting arrows and casting javelins. Then, apparently\nsatisfied that no great precaution need be observed with a feebly-manned\nship in so great a strait as the \"Rose,\" they set up a wild cry of\n\"Allah!\" and rowed towards her.\n\nIn two minutes the corsair was alongside of the \"Rose,\" and the fierce\ncrew were climbing up her sides. As she came alongside the sailors cast\ngrapnels into her rigging, and fastened her to the \"Rose;\" and then aloud\nshout of \"Hurrah for England!\" was heard; the ports opened, and a volley\nof arrows was poured upon the astonished corsair; and from the deck above\nthe assailants were thrown back into the galley, and a swarm of heavily\narmed men leapt down from the ship upon them.\n\nTaken by surprise, and indeed outnumbered, the resistance of the corsairs\nwas but slight. In a close fierce mle like this the light-armed Moors\nhad but little chance with the mail-clad English, whose heavy swords and\naxes clove their defences at a blow. The fight lasted but three minutes,\nand then the last of the corsairs was overboard.\n\nThe men who rowed the galley had uttered the most piercing cries while\nthis conflict had been raging. They were unable to take any part in\nit, had they been disposed to do so, for they were all slaves chained\nto the oars.\n\nScarcely had the conflict ended when the other galley arrived upon the\nscene; but seeing what had happened, and that her consort had fallen into\nthe hands of the English, she at once turned her head, and rowed back\nrapidly to the town from which she had come.\n\nAmong the slaves who rowed the galley were many white men, and their\ncries of joy at their liberation greatly affected those who had thus\nunexpectedly rescued them. Hammers were soon brought into requisition,\nthe shackles struck off them, and a scene of affecting joy took place.\nThe slaves were of all nationalities, but Italians and Spaniards, French\nand Greeks, formed the principal part. There was no time, however, to be\nlost; the arms and munitions of war were hastily removed from the \"Rose,\"\ntogether with the most valuable of the stores.\n\nThe galley-slaves again took their places, and this time willingly, at\nthe oars, the places of the weakest being supplied by the English, whose\nwant of skill was made up by the alacrity with which they threw their\nstrength into the work; and in an hour from the time that the galley had\narrived alongside of the \"Rose,\" her head was turned north, and with\nsixty oars she was rowing at all speed for the mouth of the bay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. IN THE HOLY LAND.\n\n\nAs soon as the galley which had escaped reached the town from which it\nhad started, it with three others at once set out in pursuit; while from\na narrow creek two other galleys made their appearance.\n\nThere were a few words of question among the English whether to stop and\ngive battle to these opponents, or to make their way with all speed. The\nlatter counsel prevailed; the earl pointing out that their lives were now\nscarcely their own, and that they had no right on their way to the holy\nsepulchre to risk them unnecessarily.\n\nFortunately they had it in their hands to fight or escape, as they chose;\nfor doubly banked as the oars now were, there was little chance of the\nenemy's galleys overtaking them. Gradually as they rowed to sea the\npursuing vessels became smaller and smaller to view, until at last they\nwere seen to turn about and make again for land.\n\nAfter some consultation between the earl and the captain of the lost\nship, it was determined to make for Rhodes. This had been settled as a\nhalting-point for the fleet, and the earl thought it probable that the\ngreater portion of those scattered by the storm would rendezvous there.\n\nSo it proved; after a voyage, which although not very long was tedious,\nowing to the number of men cramped up in so small a craft, they came\nwithin sight of the port of Rhodes, and were greatly pleased at seeing a\nperfect forest of masts there, showing that at least the greater portion\nof the fleet had survived the storm.\n\nThis was indeed the fact, and a number of other single ships dropped in\nduring the next day or two.\n\nThere was great astonishment on the part of the fleet when the long swift\ngalley was seen approaching, and numerous conjectures were offered as to\nwhat message the pirates could be bringing--for there was no mistaking\nthe appearance of the long, dangerous-looking craft.\n\nWhen, upon her approach, the standard of the Earl of Evesham was seen\nflying on the bow, a great shout of welcome arose from the fleet; and\nKing Richard himself, who happened to be on the deck of the royal ship,\nshouted to the earl to come on board and tell him what masquerading he\nwas doing there. The earl of course obeyed the order, anchoring near the\nroyal vessel, and going on board in a small boat, taking with him his\npage and squire.\n\nThe king heard with great interest the tale of the adventures of the\n\"Rose\"; and when the Earl of Evesham said that it was to Cuthbert that\nwas due the thought of the stratagem by which the galley was captured,\nand its crew saved from being carried away into hopeless slavery, the\nking patted the boy on the shoulder with such hearty force as nearly to\nthrow Cuthbert off his feet.\n\n\"By St. George!\" said the monarch, \"you are fated to be a very pink of\nknights. You seem as thoughtful as you are brave; and whatever your age\nmay be, I declare that the next time your name is brought before me I\nwill call a chapter of knights, and they shall agree that exception shall\nbe made in your favour, and that you shall at once be admitted to the\nhonourable post. You will miss your page, Sir Walter; but I am sure you\nwill not grudge him that.\"\n\n\"No, no, sire,\" said the earl. \"The lad, as I have told your Majesty, is\na connexion of mine--distant, it is true, but one of the nearest I\nhave--and it will give me the greatest pleasure to see him rising so\nrapidly, and on a fair way to distinguish himself highly. I feel already\nas proud of him as if he were my own son.\"\n\nThe fleet remained some two or three weeks at Rhodes, for many of the\nvessels were sorely buffeted and injured, masts were carried away as well\nas bulwarks battered in, and the efforts of the crews and of those of the\nwhole of the artificers of Rhodes were called into requisition. Light\nsailing craft were sent off in all directions, for the king was in a\nfever of anxiety. Among the vessels still missing was that which bore the\nQueen of Navarre and the fair Berengaria.\n\nOne day a solitary vessel was seen approaching.\n\n\"Another of our lost sheep,\" the earl said, looking out over the poop.\n\nShe proved, however, to be a merchant ship of Greece, and newly come\nfrom Cyprus.\n\nHer captain went on board the royal ship, and delivered message to the\nking, to the effect that two of the vessels had been cast upon the coast\nof Cyprus, that they had been plundered by the people, the crews\nill-treated and made prisoners by the king, and that the Queen of Navarre\nand the princess were in their hands.\n\nThis roused King Richard into one of his furies.\n\n\"Before I move a step towards the Holy Land,\" he said, \"I will avenge\nthese injuries upon this faithless and insolent king. I swear that I will\nmake him pay dearly for having laid a hand upon these ladies.\"\n\nAt once the signal was hoisted for all the vessels in a condition to sail\nto take on board water and provisions, and to prepare to sail for Cyprus;\nand the next morning at daybreak the fleet sailed out, and made their way\ntowards that island, casting anchor off the harbour of Famagosta.\n\nKing Richard sent a messenger on shore to the king, ordering him at once\nto release the prisoners; to make the most ample compensation to them; to\nplace ships at their service equal to those which had been destroyed;\nand to pay a handsome sum of money as indemnity.\n\nThe King of Cyprus, however, an insolent and haughty despot, sent back a\nmessage of defiance. King Richard at once ordered the anchors to be\nraised, and all to follow the royal ship.\n\nThe fleet entered the harbour of Famagosta; the English archers began the\nfight by sending a flight of arrows into the town. This was answered from\nthe walls by a shower of stones and darts from the machines.\n\nThere was no time wasted. The vessels were headed towards the shore, and\nas the water was deep, many of them were able to run close alongside the\nrocky wharves. In an instant, regardless of the storm of weapons poured\ndown by the defenders, the English leapt ashore.\n\nThe archers kept up so terrible a rain of missiles against the\nbattlements that the defenders could scarcely show themselves for an\ninstant there, and the men-at-arms, placing ladders against them,\nspeedily mounted, and putting aside all opposition, poured into the town.\nThe effeminate Greek soldiers of the monarch could offer no effectual\nresistance whatever, and he himself fled from the palace and gained the\nopen country, followed by a few adherents. The English gained a\nconsiderable booty, for in those days a town taken by assault was always\nlooked upon as the property of the captors. The Queen of Navarre and the\nprincess were rescued.\n\nKing Richard, however, was not satisfied with the success he had\ngained, and was determined to punish this insolent little king.\nAccordingly the English were set in motion into the interior, and town\nafter town speedily fell, or opened their gates to him. The king,\ndeserted by his troops, and detested by his people for having brought\nso terrible a scourge upon them by his reckless conduct, now sued for\npeace; but King Richard would give him no terms except dethronement,\nand this he was forced to accept. He was deprived of his crown, and\nbanished from the island.\n\nThe king now, to the surprise of his barons, announced his intention of\nat once marrying the Princess Berengaria.\n\nPopular as he was, there was yet some quiet grumbling among his troops;\nas they said, with justice, they had been waiting nearly six months in\nthe island of Sicily, and the king might well have married there, instead\nof a fresh delay being caused when so near their place of destination.\n\nHowever, the king as usual had his own way, and the marriage was\nsolemnized amidst great rejoicing and solemnity.\n\nIt was a brilliant scene indeed in the cathedral of Limasol. There were\nassembled all the principal barons of England, together with a great\nnumber of the nobles of Cyprus.\n\nCertainly no better matched pair ever stood at the altar together, for\nas King Richard was one of the strongest and bravest men of his own or\nany other time, so Berengaria is admitted to have been one of the\nloveliest maidens.\n\nThe air was rent with the acclamations of the assembled English host\nand of the numerous inhabitants of Limasol as they emerged from the\ncathedral. For a fortnight the town was given up to festivity;\ntournaments, joustings, banquets succeeded each other day after day,\nand the islanders, who were fond of pleasure, and indeed very wealthy,\nvied with the English in the entertainments which they gave in honour\nof the occasion.\n\nThe festivities over, the king gave the welcome order to proceed on their\nvoyage. They had now been joined by all the vessels left behind at\nRhodes, and it was found that only a few were missing, and that the great\nstorm, terrible as it had been, had inflicted less damage upon the fleet\nthan was at first feared.\n\nTwo days' sail brought them within sight of the white walls of Acre, and\nit was on the 8th of June, 1191, that the fleet sailed into the port of\nthat town. Tremendous acclamations greeted the arrival of the English\narmy by the host assembled on the shores.\n\nAcre had been besieged for two years, but in vain; and even the arrival\nof the French army under Phillip Augustus had failed to turn the scale.\nThe inhabitants defended themselves with desperate bravery; every assault\nupon the walls had been repulsed with immense slaughter; and at no great\ndistance off the Sultan Saladin, with a large army, was watching the\nprogress of the siege.\n\nThe fame of King Richard and the English was so great, however, that the\nbesiegers had little doubt that his arrival would change the position of\nthings; and even the French, in spite of the bad feeling which had\nexisted in Sicily, joined with the knights and army of the King of\nJerusalem in acclaiming the arrival of the English.\n\nPhillip Augustus, the French King, was of a somewhat weak and wavering\ndisposition. It would have been thought that after his dispute with King\nRichard he would have gladly done all in his power to carry Acre before\nthe arrival of his great rival. To the great disappointment of the\nFrench, however, he declared that he would take no step in the general\nassault until the arrival of Richard; and although the French had given\nsome assistance to the besiegers, the army had really remained passive\nfor many weeks.\n\nNow, however, that the English had arrived, little time was lost; for the\nmoment the dissensions and jealousies between the monarchs were patched\nup, the two hosts naturally imitated the example of their sovereigns, and\nFrench and English worked side by side in throwing up trenches against\nthe walls, in building movable towers for the attack, and in preparing\nfor the great onslaught.\n\nThe French were the first to finish their preparations, and they\ndelivered a tremendous assault upon the walls. The besieged, however, did\nnot lose heart, and with the greatest bravery repulsed every attempt. The\nscaling ladders were hurled backwards, the towers were destroyed by Greek\nfire; boiling oil was hurled down upon the men who advanced under the\nshelter of machines to undermine the walls; and after desperate fighting\nthe French fell back, baffled and beaten.\n\nThere was some quiet exultation in the English lines at the defeat of the\nFrench, for they believed that a better fortune would crown their own\nefforts. Such, however, to their surprise and mortification, was not the\ncase. When their preparations were completed, they attacked with splendid\nbravery. They were fighting under the eyes of their king, and in sight of\nthe French army, who had a few days before been baffled; and if bravery\nand devotion could have carried the walls of Acre, assuredly King\nRichard's army would have accomplished the task.\n\nIt was, however, too great for them, and with vast loss the army fell\nback to its camp, King Richard raging like a wounded lion. Many of his\nbarons had been killed in the assault, and the pikemen and men-at-arms\nhad suffered heavily. The Earl of Evesham had been wounded; Cuthbert had\ntaken no part in the assault, for the earl, knowing his bravery, had\nforbidden his doing so, as he foresaw the struggle would be of the most\ndesperate character; and as it was not usual for pages to accompany\ntheir lords on the battle-field, Cuthbert could not complain of his being\nforbidden to take part in the fight.\n\nThe earl, however, permitted him to accompany Cnut and the bowmen, who\ndid great service by the accuracy of their aim, preventing by their storm\nof arrows the men on the battlements from taking steady aim and working\ntheir machines, and so saved the Earl of Evesham's troop and those\nfighting near him from suffering nearly as heavy loss as some of those\nengaged in other quarters.\n\nBut while successful in beating off all assaults, the defenders of Acre\nwere now nearly at the end of their resources. The Emperor Saladin,\nalthough he had collected an army of 200,000 men, yet feared to advance\nand give battle to the crusaders in their own lines--for they had thrown\nup round their camp strong entrenchments, to prevent the progress of the\nsiege being disturbed by forces from without.\n\nThe people of Acre seeing the time pass and no sign of a rescuing force,\ntheir provisions being utterly exhausted, and pestilence and fever making\nfrightful ravages in the city, at last determined to surrender.\n\nFor over two years they had made a resistance of the most valiant\ndescription, and now, despairing of success or rescue, and seeing the\nhosts of their besiegers increasing day by day, they hoisted a flag upon\nthe walls, and sent a deputation to the kings, asking for terms if they\nsubmitted. They would have done well had they submitted upon the arrival\nof the French and English reinforcements. For the monarchs, annoyed by\nthe defeat of their forces and by the heavy losses they had sustained,\nand knowing that the besieged were now at their last crust, were not\ndisposed to be merciful.\n\nHowever, the horrors which then attended the capture of cities in a\nwar in which so little quarter was given on either side, were avoided.\nThe city was to be surrendered; the much-prized relic contained within\nits walls--said to be a piece of the true Cross which had been\ncaptured by the Saracens at the battle of Tiberias, in which they had\nalmost annihilated the Christian armies a few years before--was to be\nsurrendered; the Christian prisoners in their hands were to be given\nup unharmed; and the inhabitants undertook to pay 200,000 pieces of\ngold to the kings within forty days, under the condition that the\nfighting men now taken prisoners were to be put to death should this\nransom not be paid.\n\nThe conquest of Acre was hailed throughout Christendom as a triumph of\nthe highest importance. It opened again the gates of the Holy Land; and\nso tremendous was the strength of the fortress, that it was deemed that\nif this stronghold were unable to resist effectually the arms of the\ncrusaders, and that if Saladin with so great an army did not dare to\nadvance to its rescue, then the rest of the Holy Land would speedily fall\nunder the hands of the invading army.\n\nWith the fall of Acre, however, the dissensions between the two kings,\nwhich had for a while been allowed to rest while the common work was to\nbe done, broke out again with renewed intensity. The jealousy of Phillip\nAugustus was raised to the highest point by the general enthusiasm of the\ncombined armies for the valiant King of England, and by the authority\nwhich that monarch exercised in the councils. He therefore suddenly\nannounced his intention of returning to France.\n\nThis decision at first occasioned the greatest consternation in the ranks\nof the crusaders; but this feeling was lessened when the king announced\nthat he should leave a large portion of the French army behind, under the\ncommand of the Duke of Burgundy. The wiser councillors were satisfied\nwith the change. Although there was a reduction of the total fighting\nforce, yet the fact that it was now centred under one head, and that King\nRichard would now be in supreme command, was deemed to more than\ncounterbalance the loss of a portion of the French army.\n\nBefore starting on the march for Jerusalem, King Richard sullied his\nreputation by causing all the defenders of Acre to be put to death, their\nransom not having arrived at the stipulated time.\n\nThen the allied army set out upon their journey. The fleet cruised along\nnear them, and from it they obtained all that was requisite for their\nwants, and yet, notwithstanding these advantages, the toil and fatigue\nwere terrible. Roads scarcely existed, and the army marched across the\nrough and broken country. There was no straggling, but each kept his\nplace; and if unable to do so, fell and died. The blazing sun poured down\nupon them with an appalling force; the dust which rose when they left the\nrocks and came upon flat sandy ground, almost smothered them. Water was\nonly obtainable at the halts, and then was frequently altogether\ninsufficient for the wants of the army; while in front, on flank, and in\nrear hovered clouds of the cavalry of Saladin.\n\nAt times King Richard would allow parties of his knights to detach\nthemselves from the force to drive off these enemies. But it was the\nchase of a lion after a hare. The knights in their heavy armour and\npowerful steeds were left behind as if standing still, by the fleet\nBedouins on their desert coursers; and the pursuers, exhausted and worn\nout, were always glad to regain the ranks of the army.\n\nThese clouds of cavalry belonging to the enemy did not content\nthemselves with merely menacing and cutting off stragglers. At times,\nwhen they thought they saw an opening, they would dash in and attack the\ncolumn desperately, sometimes gaining temporary advantages, killing and\nwounding many, then fleeing away again into the desert.\n\nFinding that it was impossible to catch these wary horsemen, King Richard\nordered his bowmen to march outside his cavalry, so that when the enemy's\nhorse approached within bowshot they should open upon them with arrows;\nthen, should the horsemen persist in charging, the archers were at once\nto take refuge behind the lines of the knights.\n\nDay after day passed in harassing conflicts. The distance passed over\neach day was very small, and the sufferings of the men from thirst, heat,\nand fatigue enormous. Cuthbert could well understand now what he had\nheard of great armies melting away, for already men began to succumb in\nlarge numbers to the terrible heat, and the path traversed by the army\nwas scattered with corpses of those who had fallen victims to sunstroke.\nNot even at night did the attacks of the enemy cease, and a portion of\nthe harassed force was obliged to keep under arms to repel assaults.\n\nSo passed the time until the army arrived at Azotus, and there, to the\ndelight of the crusaders, who only longed to get at their foes, they\nbeheld the whole force of Saladin, 200,000 strong, barring their way. Had\nit not been for the stern discipline enforced by King Richard, the\nknights of England and France would have repeated the mistake which had\ncaused the extermination of the Christian force at Tiberias, and would\nhave levelled their lances and charged recklessly into the mass of their\nenemies. But the king, riding round the flanks and front of the force,\ngave his orders in the sternest way, with the threat that any man who\nmoved from the ranks should die by his hand.\n\nThe army was halted, the leaders gathered round the king, and a hasty\nconsultation was held. Richard insisted upon the fight being conducted\nupon the same principles as the march--that the line of archers\nshould stand outside the knights, and should gall the advancing force\nwith arrows till the last moment, and then retire among the cavalry,\nonly to sally out again as the Bedouins fell back from the steel wall\nof horsemen.\n\nCuthbert had now for the first time donned full armour, and rode behind\nthe Earl of Evesham as his esquire, for the former esquire had been left\nbehind, ill with fever, at Acre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE ACCOLADE.\n\n\nIt was now a year since they had left England, and Cuthbert had much\ngrown and widened out in the interval, and had never neglected an\nopportunity of practising with arms; and the earl was well aware that he\nshould obtain as efficient assistance from him in time of need as he\ncould desire.\n\nThis was the first time that Cuthbert, and indeed the great proportion of\nthose present in the Christian host, had seen the enemy in force, and\nthey eagerly watched the vast array. It was picturesque in the extreme,\nwith a variety and brightness of colour rivalling that of the Christian\nhost. In banners and pennons the latter made a braver show; but the\nfloating robes of the infidel showed a far brighter mass of colour than\nthe steel armour of the Christians.\n\nHere were people drawn from widely separated parts of Saladin's\ndominions. Here were Nubians from the Nile, tall and powerful men, jet\nblack in skin, with lines of red and white paint on their faces, giving a\nghastly and wild appearance to them. On their shoulders were skins of\nlions and other wild animals. They carried short bows, and heavy clubs\nstudded with iron. By them were the Bedouin cavalry, light, sinewy men,\nbrown as berries, with white turbans and garments. Near these were the\ncavalry from Syria and the plains of Assyria--wild horsemen with\nsemi-barbarous armour and scarlet trappings. Here were the solid lines of\nthe Egyptian infantry, steady troops, upon whom Saladin much relied. Here\nwere other tribes, gathered from afar, each distinguished by its own\nparticular marks. In silence did this vast array view awhile the solid\nmass of the Christians. Suddenly a strange din of discordant music from\nthousands of musical instruments--conches and horns, cymbals and drums,\narose in wild confusion. Shouts of defiance in a dozen tongues and from\n200,000 throats rose wild and shrill upon the air, while clear above all\nthe din were heard the strange vibratory cries of the warriors from the\nEgyptian highlands.\n\n\"One would think,\" said Cnut grimly to Cuthbert, \"that the infidels\nimagine we are a flock of antelopes to be frightened by an outcry. They\nwould do far better to save their wind for future use. They will want it,\nmethinks, when we get fairly among them. Who would have thought that a\nnumber of men, heathen and infidel though they be, could have made so\nfoul an outcry?\"\n\nCuthbert laughed.\n\n\"Every one fights according to his own method, Cnut; and I am not sure\nthat there is not something to be said for this outcry, for it is really\nso wild and fearful that it makes my blood almost curdle in my veins; and\nwere it not that I know the proved valour of our knights and footmen, I\nshould feel shaken by this terrible introduction to the fight.\"\n\n\"I heed it no more,\" said Cnut, \"than the outcry of wild fowl, when one\ncomes upon them suddenly on a lake in winter. It means no more than that;\nand I reckon that they are trying to encourage themselves fully as much\nas to frighten us. However, we shall soon see. If they can fight as well\nas they can scream, they certainly will get no answering shouts from us.\nThe English bulldog fights silently, and bite as hard as he will, you\nwill hear little beyond a low growl. Now, my men,\" he said, turning to\nhis archers, \"methinks the heathen are about to begin in earnest. Keep\nsteady; do not fire until you are sure that they are within range. Draw\nyour bows well to your ears, and straightly and steadily let fly. Never\nheed the outcry or the rush, keep steady to the last moment. There is\nshelter behind you, and fierce as the attack may be, you can find a sure\nrefuge behind the line of the knights.\"\n\nCnut with his archers formed part of the line outside the array of\nEnglish knights, and the arrows of the English bowmen fell fast as bands\nof the Bedouin horse circled round them in the endeavour to draw the\nChristians on to the attack. For some time Saladin persisted in these\ntactics. With his immense superiority of force he reckoned that if the\nChristian chivalry would but charge him, the victory of Tiberias would be\nrepeated. Hemmed in by numbers, borne down by the weight of armour and\nthe effects of the blazing sun, the knights would succumb as much to\nfatigue as to the force of their foes. King Richard's orders, however,\nwere well obeyed, and at last the Moslem chief, urged by the entreaties\nof his leading emirs, who felt ashamed that so large a force should\nhesitate to attack one so vastly inferior in numbers, determined upon\ntaking the initiative, and forming his troops in a semicircle round the\nChristian army, launched his horsemen to the attack. The instant they\ncame within range, a cloud of arrows from the English archers fell among\nthem, but the speed at which the desert horses covered the ground\nrendered it impossible for the archers to discharge more than one or two\nshafts before the enemy were upon them. Quickly as they now slipped back\nand sought refuge under the lances of the knights, many of them were\nunable to get back in time, and were cut down by the Saracens. The rest\ncrept between the horses or under their bellies into the rear, and there\nprepared to sally out again as soon as the enemy retired, The Christian\nknights sat like a wall of steel upon their horses, their lances were\nlevelled, and, brave as the Bedouin horsemen were, they felt to break\nthis massive line was impossible. The front line, however, charged well\nup to the points of the lances, against which they hewed with their sharp\nscimitars, frequently severing the steel top from the ashpole, and then\nbreaking through and engaging in hand-to-hand conflict with the knights.\nBehind the latter sat their squires, with extra spears and arms ready to\nhand to their masters; and in close combat, the heavy maces with their\nspike ends were weapons before which the light clad horsemen went down\nlike reeds before a storm.\n\nHour after hour the Arab horsemen persisted in their attack, suffering\nheavily, but determined to conquer if possible. Then Saladin suddenly\nordered a retreat, and at seeing their enemy fly, the impetuosity of the\ncrusaders at last broke out. With a shout they dashed after the foe. King\nRichard, knowing that his followers had already shown a patience far\nbeyond what he could have expected, now headed the onslaught, performing\nprodigies of valour with his single arm, and riding from point to point\nto see that all was well.\n\nThe early resistance of the infidel host was comparatively slight.\nThe heavy mass of the Christian cavalry, with their levelled lances,\nswept through the ranks of the light horsemen, and trampled them down\nlike grass beneath their feet; but every moment the resistance became\nmore stubborn.\n\nSaladin, knowing the Christians would sooner or later assume the\noffensive, had gathered his troops line in line behind the front ranks,\nand as the force of the crusaders' charge abated, so did the number of\nfoes in their front multiply. Not only this, but upon either side chosen\nbands swept down, and ere long the Christians were brought to a stand,\nand all were fighting hand to hand with their enemies. The lances were\nthrown away now, and with axe and mace each fought for himself.\n\nThe Earl of Evesham was one of a group of knights whom King Richard had\nthat day ordered to keep close to his person, and around this group the\nfight raged most furiously.\n\nSaladin, aware of the extreme personal valour and warlike qualities of\nKing Richard, set the greatest value upon his death or capture, and had\nordered a large number of his best troops to devote their whole attention\nto attacking the King of England. The royal standard carried behind the\nking was a guide to their onslaught, and great as was the strength and\nvalour of King Richard, he with difficulty was able to keep at bay the\nhosts that swept around him.\n\nNow that the lance had been abandoned for battle-axe, Cuthbert was able\nto take an active part in the struggle, his duties consisting mainly in\nguarding the rear of his master, and preventing his being overthrown by\nany sudden attack on the flank or from behind.\n\nKing Richard was bent not only on defending himself from the attacks of\nhis foes, but on directing the general course of the battle; and from\ntime to time he burst, with his own trusty knights, through the ring of\nfoes, and rode from point to point of the field, calling the knights\ntogether, exhorting them to steadiness, and restoring the fight where its\nfortunes seemed doubtful. At one time the impetuosity of the king led him\ninto extreme danger. He had burst through the enemy surrounding him, and\nthese, by order of their captain, allowed him to pass through their\nranks, and then threw themselves together in his rear, to cut him off\nfrom the knights who rode behind. The maneuver was successful. The rush\nof horsemen fairly carried away the Christian knights, and one or two\nalone were able to make their way through.\n\nAmid the wild confusion that raged, where each man was fighting for his\nown life, and but little view of what was passing could be obtained\nthrough the barred visor, the fact that the king was separated from them\nwas known to but few. Sir Walter himself was engaged fiercely in a\nhand-to-hand fight with four Bedouins who surrounded him, when Cuthbert\nshouted,--\n\n\"The king, Sir Walter! the king! He is cut off and surrounded! For\nheaven's sake ride to him. See! the royal standard is down.\"\n\nWith a shout the earl turned, brained one of his foes with a sweep of his\nheavy axe, and, followed by Cuthbert, dashed to the assistance of the\nking. The weight of his horse and armour cleft through the crowd, and in\na brief space he penetrated to the side of King Richard, who was borne\nupon by a host of foes. Just as they reached them a Bedouin who had been\nstruck from his horse crawled beneath the noble charger of King Richard,\nand drove his scimitar deep into its bowels. The animal reared high in\nits sudden pain, and then fell on the ground, carrying the king, who was\nunable to disengage himself quickly enough.\n\nIn an instant the Earl of Evesham had leapt from his horse and with his\nbroad triangular shield extended sought to cover him from the press of\nenemies. Cuthbert imitated his lord, and strove to defend the latter from\nattacks from the rear. For a moment or two the sweep of the earl's heavy\naxe and Cuthbert's circling sword kept back the foe, but this could not\nlast. King Richard in vain strove to extricate his leg from beneath his\nfallen steed. Cuthbert saw at a glance that the horse still lived, and\nwith a sudden slash of his sword he struck it on the hind quarter. Goaded\nby the pain the noble animal made a last effort to rise, but only to fall\nback dead. The momentary action was, however, sufficient for King\nRichard, who drew his leg from under it, and with his heavy battle-axe in\nhand, rose with a shout, and stood by the side of the earl.\n\nIn vain did the Bedouins strive to cut down and overpower the two\nchampions; in vain did they urge their horses to ride over them. With\neach sweep of his axe the king either dismounted a foe or clove in the\nhead of his steed, and a wall of slain around them testified to the\ntremendous power of their arms. Still, even such warriors as these could\nnot long sustain the conflict. The earl had already received several\ndesperate wounds, and the king himself was bleeding from some severe\ngashes with the keen-edged scimitars. Cuthbert was already down, when a\nshout of \"St. George!\" was heard, and a body of English knights clove\nthrough the throng of Saracens and reached the side of King Richard.\nClose behind these in a mass pressed the British footmen with bill and\npike, the enemy giving way foot by foot before their steady discipline.\n\nThe king was soon on horseback again, and rallying his troops on, led\nthem for one more great and final charge upon the enemy.\n\nThe effect was irresistible. Appalled by the slaughter which they had\nsuffered, and by the tremendous strength and energy of the Christian\nknights, the Saracens broke and fled; and the last reserves of Saladin\ngave way as the king, shouting his war-cry of \"God help the holy\nsepulchre!\" fell upon them. Once, indeed, the battle still seemed\ndoubtful, for a fresh band of the enemy at that moment arrived and joined\nin the fray. The crusaders were now, however, inspired with such courage\nand confidence that they readily obeyed the king's war-cry, gathered in a\nfirm body, and hurled themselves upon this new foe. Then the Saracens\nfinally turned and fled, and the Christian victory was complete.\n\nIt was one of the features of this war that however thorough the\nvictories of the Christians, the Saracens very speedily recovered from\ntheir effects. A Christian defeat was crushing and entire; the knights\ndied as they stood, and defeat meant annihilation. Upon the other hand,\nthe Saracens and Bedouins when they felt that their efforts to win the\nbattle were unsuccessful, felt no shame or humiliation in scattering like\nsheep. On their fleet horses and in their light attire they could easily\ndistance the Christians, who never, indeed, dreamt of pursuing them. The\nday after the fight, the enemy would collect again under their chiefs,\nand be as ready as before to renew their harassing warfare.\n\nOn his return from the field, the king assembled many of his principal\nknights and leaders, and summoned the Earl of Evesham, with the message\nthat he was to bring his esquire with him. When they reached the tent,\nthe king said,--\n\n\"My lords, as some of you may be aware, I have this day had a narrow\nescape from death. Separated from you in the battle, and attended only by\nmy standard-bearer, I was surrounded by the Saracens. I should doubtless\nhave cleft my way through the infidel dogs, but a foul peasant stabbed my\ncharger from below, and the poor brute fell with me. My standard-bearer\nwas killed, and in another moment my nephew Arthur would have been your\nking, had it not been that my good lord here, attended by this brave lad,\nappeared. I have seen a good deal of fighting, but never did I see a\nbraver stand than they made above my body. The Earl of Evesham, as you\nall know, is one of my bravest knights, and to him I can simply say,\n'Thanks; King Richard does not forget a benefit like this.' But such aid\nas I might well look for from so stout a knight as the Earl of Evesham, I\ncould hardly have expected on the part of a mere boy like this. It is not\nthe first time that I have been under a debt of gratitude to him; for it\nwas his watchfulness and bravery which saved Queen Berengaria from being\ncarried off by the French in Sicily. I deemed him too young then for the\norder of knighthood--although indeed bravery has no age; still for a\nprivate benefit, and that performed against allies, in name at least, I\ndid not wish so far to fly in the face of usage as to make him a knight.\nI promised him then, however, that the first time he distinguished\nhimself against the infidel he should win his spurs. I think that you\nwill agree with me, my lords, that he has done so. Not only did he stand\nover me, and with great bravery defend Sir Walter from attacks from\nbehind, but his ready wit saved me, when even his sword and that of Sir\nWalter would have failed to do so. Penned down under poor Robin, I was\npowerless to move until our young esquire, in an interval of slashing at\nhis assailants, found time to give a sharp blow together with a shout to\nRobin. The poor beast tried to rise, and the movement, short as it was,\nenabled me to draw my leg from under him, and then with my mace I was\nenabled to make a stand until you arrived at my side. I think, my lords,\nthat you will agree with me that Cuthbert, the son of Sir William de\nLance, is fit for the honour of knighthood.\"\n\nA general chorus of approval arose from the assembly, and the king,\nbidding Cuthbert kneel before him, drew his sword and laid it across his\nshoulders, dubbing him Sir Cuthbert de Lance. When he had risen, the\ngreat barons of England pressed round to shake his hand, and Cuthbert,\nwho was a modest young fellow, felt almost ashamed at the honours which\nwere bestowed upon him. The usual ceremonies and penances which young\nknights had to undergo before admission into the body--and which in those\ndays were extremely punctilious, and indeed severe, consisting, among\nother things, in fasting, in watching the armour at night, in seclusion\nand religious services--were omitted when the accolade was bestowed for\nbravery in the field.\n\nThe king ordered his armourer at once to make for Cuthbert a suit of the\nfinest armour, and authorized him to carry on his shield a sword raising\na royal crown from the ground, in token of the deed for which the honour\nof knighthood had been bestowed upon him.\n\nUpon his return to the earl's camp the news of his new dignity spread at\nonce among the followers of Sir Walter, and many and hearty were the\ncheers that went up from the throats of the Saxon foresters, led by Cnut.\nThese humble friends were indeed delighted at his success, for they felt\nthat to him they owed very much; and his kindness of manner and the\ngaiety of heart which he had shown during the hardships they had\nundergone since their start, had greatly endeared him to them.\n\nCuthbert was now to take rank among the knights who followed the banner\nof the earl. A tent was erected for him, an esquire assigned to him, and\nthe lad as he entered his new abode felt almost bewildered at the change\nwhich had taken place in one short day--that he, at the age of sixteen,\nshould have earned the honour of knighthood, and the approval of the King\nof England, expressed before all the great barons of the realm, was\nindeed an honour such as he could never have hoped for; and the thought\nof what his mother would say should the news reach her in her quiet Saxon\nhome, brought the tears into his eyes. He had not gone through the usual\nreligious ceremonies, but he knelt in his tent alone, and prayed that he\nmight be made worthy of the honours bestowed upon him; that he might\nfulfil the duties of a Christian knight fearlessly and honourably; that\nhis sword might never be raised but for the right; that he might devote\nhimself to the protection of the oppressed, and the honour of God; that\nhis heart might be kept from evil; and that he might carry through life,\nunstained his new escutcheon.\n\nIf the English had thought that their victory would have gained them\nimmunity from the Saracen attacks, they were speedily undeceived. The\nhost, indeed, which had barred their way had broken up; but its fragments\nwere around them, and the harassing attacks began again with a violence\nand persistency even greater than before. The crusaders, indeed, occupied\nonly the ground upon which they stood. It was death to venture 100 yards\nfrom the camp, unless in a strong body; and the smallest efforts to bring\nin food from the country round were instantly met and repelled. Only in\nvery strong bodies could the knights venture from camp even to forage for\ntheir horses, and the fatigues and sufferings of all were in a way\nrelieved by the great victory of Azotus.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. IN THE HANDS OF THE SARACENS.\n\n\nThe English had hoped that after one pitched battle they should be able\nto advance upon Jerusalem, but they had reckoned without the climate\nand illness.\n\nAlthough unconquered in the fray, the Christian army was weakened by its\nsufferings to such an extent that it was virtually brought to a\nstandstill. Even King Richard, with all his impetuosity, dared not\nventure to cut adrift from the seashore, and to march direct upon\nJerusalem; that city was certainly not to be taken without a long siege,\nand this could only be undertaken by an army strong enough, not only to\ncarry out so great a task, but to meet and defeat the armies which\nSaladin would bring up to the rescue, and to keep open the line down to\nJoppa, by which alone provisions, and the engines necessary for the\nsiege, could be brought up. Hence the war resolved itself into a series\nof expeditions and detached fights.\n\nThe British camp was thoroughly fortified, and thence parties of the\nknights sallied out and engaged in conflicts with the Saracens, with\nvarying success. On several of these expeditions Cuthbert attended the\nearl, and behaved with a bravery which showed him well worthy of the\nhonours which he had received.\n\nUpon one occasion the news reached camp that a party of knights, who had\ngone out to guard a number of footmen cutting forage and bringing it\ninto camp, had been surrounded and had taken refuge in a small town,\nwhose gates they had battered in when they saw the approach of an\noverwhelming host of the enemy. King Richard himself headed a strong\nforce and advanced to their assistance. Their approach was not seen until\nwithin a short distance of the enemy, upon whom the crusaders fell with\nthe force of a thunderbolt, and cleft their way through their lines.\nAfter a short pause in the little town, they prepared to again cut their\nway through, joined by the party who had there been besieged. The task\nwas now however, far more difficult; for the footmen would be unable to\nkeep up with the rapid charge of the knights, and it was necessary not\nonly to clear the way, but to keep it open for their exit. King Richard\nhimself and the greater portion of his knights were to lead the charge;\nanother party were to follow behind the footmen, who were ordered to\nadvance at the greatest speed of which they were capable, while their\nrearguard by charges upon the enemy, kept them at bay. To this latter\nparty Cuthbert was attached.\n\nThe Saracens followed their usual tactics, and this time with great\nsuccess. Dividing as the king with his knights charged them, they\nsuffered these to pass through with but slight resistance, and then\nclosed in upon their track, while another and still more numerous body\nfell upon the footmen and their guard. Again and again did the knights\ncharge through the ranks of the Moslems, while the billmen stoutly kept\ntogether and resisted the onslaughts of the enemy's cavalry. In spite of\ntheir bravery, however, the storm of arrows shot by the desert horsemen\nthinned their ranks with terrible rapidity. Charging up to the very point\nof the spears, these wild horsemen fired their arrows into the faces of\ntheir foe, and although numbers of them fell beneath the more formidable\nmissiles sent by the English archers, their numbers were so overwhelming\nthat the little band melted away. The small party of knights, too, were\nrapidly thinned, although performing prodigious deeds of valour. The\nSaracens when dismounted or wounded still fought on foot, their object\nbeing always to stab or hough the horses, and so dismount the riders.\nKing Richard and his force, though making the most desperate efforts to\nreturn to the assistance of the rearguard, were baffled by the sturdy\nresistance of the Saracens, and the position of those in the rear was\nfast becoming hopeless.\n\nOne by one the gallant little band of knights fell, and a sea of turbans\nclosed over the fluttering plumes. Cuthbert, after defending himself with\nextreme bravery for a long time, was at last separated from the small\nremainder of his comrades by a rush of the enemy's horse, and when\nfighting desperately he received a heavy blow at the back of the head\nfrom the mace of a huge Nubian soldier, and fell senseless to the ground.\n\nWhen he recovered his consciousness, the first impression upon his mind\nwas the stillness which had succeeded to the din of battle; the shouts\nand war-cries of the crusaders, the wild yells of the Moslems, were\nhushed, and in their place was a quiet chatter in many unknown tongues,\nand the sound of laughter and feasting. Raising his head and looking\nround, Cuthbert saw that he and some ten of his comrades were lying\ntogether in the midst of a Saracen camp, and that he was a prisoner to\nthe infidels. The sun streamed down with tremendous force upon them;\nthere was no shelter; and though all were wounded and parched with\nthirst, the Saracens of whom they besought water, pointing to their\nmouths and making signs of their extreme thirst, laughed in their faces,\nand signified by a gesture that it was scarcely worth the trouble to\ndrink when they were likely so soon to be put to death.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon before any change was manifest. Then\nCuthbert observed a stir in the camp; the men ran to their horses, leapt\non their backs, and with wild cries of \"Welcome!\" started off at full\nspeed. Evidently some personage was about to arrive, and the fate of the\nprisoners would be solved. A few words were from time to time exchanged\nbetween these, each urging the other to keep up his heart and defy the\ninfidel. One or two had succumbed to their wounds during the afternoon,\nand only six were able to stand erect when summoned to do so by some of\ntheir guard, who made signs to them that a great personage was coming.\nSoon the shouts of the horsemen and other sounds announced that the great\nchief was near at hand, and the captives gathered from the swelling\nshouts of the Arabs that the new arrival was Sultan Suleiman--or Saladin,\nfor he was called by both names--surrounded by a body-guard of\nsplendidly-dressed attendants. The emir, who was himself plainly attired,\nreined up his horse in front of the captives.\n\n\"You are English,\" he said, in the lingua-franca which was the medium of\ncommunication between the Eastern and Western peoples in those days. \"You\nare brave warriors, and I hear that before you were taken you slaughtered\nnumbers of my people. They did wrong to capture you and bring you here to\nbe killed. Your cruel king gives no mercy to those who fall into his\nhands. You must not expect it here, you who without a pretence of right\ninvade my country, slaughter my people, and defeat my armies. The murder\nof the prisoners of Acre has closed my heart to all mercy. There, your\nking put 10,000 prisoners to death in cold blood, a month after the\ncapture of the place, because the money at which he had placed their\nransom had not arrived. We Arabs do not carry huge masses of gold about\nwith us; and although I could have had it brought from Egypt, I did not\nthink that so brave a monarch as Richard of England could have committed\nso cruel an action in cold blood. When we are fresh from battle, and our\nwounds are warm, and our hearts are full of rage and fury, we kill our\nprisoners; but to do so weeks after a battle is contrary to the laws\nalike of your religion and of ours. However, it is King Richard who has\nsealed your doom, not I. You are knights, and I do not insult you with\nthe offer of turning from your religion and joining me. Should one of you\nwish to save his life on these conditions, I will, however, promise him a\nplace of position and authority among us.\"\n\nNone of the knights moved to accept the offer, but each, as the eye of\nthe emir ran along the line, answered with an imprecation of contempt and\nhatred. Saladin waved his hand, and one by one the captives were led\naside, walking as proudly to their doom as if they had been going to a\nfeast. Each wrung the hand of the one next to him as he turned, and then\nwithout a word followed his captors. There was a dull sound heard, and\none by one the heads of the knights rolled in the sand.\n\nCuthbert happened to be last in the line, and as the executioners laid\nhands upon him and removed his helmet, the eye of the sultan fell upon\nhim, and he almost started at perceiving the extreme youth of his\ncaptive. He held his hand aloft to arrest the movements of the\nexecutioners, and signalled for Cuthbert to be brought before him again.\n\n\"You are but a boy,\" he said. \"All the knights who have hitherto fallen\ninto my hands have been men of strength and power; how is it that I see a\nmere youth among their ranks, and wearing the golden spurs of\nknighthood?\"\n\n\"King Richard himself made me a knight,\" Cuthbert said proudly, \"after\nhaving stood across him when his steed had been foully stabbed at the\nbattle of Azotus, and the whole Moslem host were around him.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the emir, \"were you one of the two who, as I have heard,\ndefended the king for some time against all assaults? It were hard\nindeed to kill so brave a youth. I doubt me not that at present you are\nas firmly determined to die a Christian knight as those who have gone\nbefore you? But time may change you. At any rate for the present your\ndoom is postponed.\"\n\nHe turned to a gorgeously-dressed noble next to him, and said,--\n\n\"Your brother, Ben Abin, is Governor of Jerusalem, and the gardens of\nthe palace are fair. Take this youth to him as a present, and set him to\nwork in his gardens. His life I have spared, in all else Ben Abin will\nbe his master.\"\n\nCuthbert heard without emotion the words which changed his fate from\ndeath to slavery. Many, he knew, who were captured in these wars were\ncarried away as slaves to different parts of Asia, and it did not seem to\nhim that the change was in any way a boon. However, life is dear, and it\nwas but natural that a thought should leap into his heart that soon\neither the crusaders might force a way into Jerusalem and there rescue\nhim, or that he himself might in some way escape.\n\nThe sultan having thus concluded the subject, turned away, and galloped\noff surrounded by his body-guard.\n\nThose who had captured the Christians now stripped off the armour of\nCuthbert; then he was mounted on a bare-backed steed, and with four\nBedouins, with their long lances, riding beside him, started for\nJerusalem. After a day of long and rapid riding, the Arabs stopped\nsuddenly, on the crest of a hill, with a shout of joy, and throwing\nthemselves from their horses, bent with their foreheads to the earth at\nthe sight of their holy city. Cuthbert, as he gazed at the stately walls\nof Jerusalem, and the noble buildings within, felt bitterly that it was\nnot thus that he had hoped to see the holy city. He had dreamt of\narriving before it with his comrades, proud and delighted at their\nsuccess so far, and confident in their power soon to wrest the town\nbefore them from the hands of the Moslems. Instead of this he was a\nslave--a slave to the infidel, perhaps never more to see a white face,\nsave that of some other unfortunate like himself.\n\nEven now in its fallen state no city is so impressive at first sight as\nJerusalem; the walls, magnificent in height and strength, and picturesque\nin their deep embattlements, rising on the edge of a deep valley. Every\nbuilding has its name and history. Here is the church built by the first\ncrusaders; there the mighty mosque of Suleiman on the site of the Temple;\nfar away on a projecting ridge the great building known as the Tomb of\nMoses; on the right beyond the houses rise the towers on the Roman walls;\nthe Pool of Bethsaida lies in the hollow; in the centre are the cupolas\nof the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Among all the fairest cities of the\nworld, there are none which can compare in stately beauty with Jerusalem.\nDoubtless it was a fairer city in those days, for long centuries of\nTurkish possession have reduced many of the former stately palaces to\nruins. Then, as now, the banner of the Prophet floated over the high\nplaces; but whereas at present the population is poor and squalid, the\ncity in those days contained a far large number of inhabitants,\nirrespective of the great garrison collected for its defence.\n\nThe place from which Cuthbert had his first sight of Jerusalem is that\nfrom which the best view is to be obtained--the crest of the Mount of\nOlives. After a minute or two spent in looking at the city, the Arabs\nwith a shout continued their way down into the valley. Crossing this\nthey ascended the steep road to the walls, brandishing their lances and\ngiving yells of triumph; then riding two upon each side of their\nprisoner, to protect him from any fanatic who might lay a hand upon him,\nthey passed under the gate known as the Gate of Suleiman into the city.\n\nThe populace thronged the streets; and the news brought by the horsemen\nthat a considerable portion of the Christian host had been defeated and\nslain, passed from mouth to mouth, and was received with yells of\nexultation. Execrations were heaped upon Cuthbert, who rode along with an\nair as quiet and composed as if he were the centre of an ovation instead\nof that of an outburst of hatred.\n\nHe would, indeed, speedily have been torn from his guards, had not these\nshouted that he was placed in their hands by Saladin himself for conduct\nto the governor. As the emir was as sharp and as ruthless with his own\npeople as with the prisoners who fell into his hands, the name acted as a\ntalisman, and Cuthbert and his escort rode forward without molestation\nuntil they reached the entrance to the palace.\n\nDismounting, Cuthbert was now led before the governor himself, a stern\nand grave-looking man, sitting cross-legged on a divan surrounded by\nofficers and attendants. He heard in silence the account given him by the\nescort, bowed his head at the commands of Suleiman, and, without\naddressing a word to Cuthbert, indicated to two attendants that he was to\nbe removed into the interior of the house. Here the young knight was led\nto a small dungeon-like room; bread and dates with a cruse of water were\nplaced before him; the door was then closed and locked without, and he\nfound himself alone with his thoughts.\n\nNo one came near him that night, and he slept as soundly as he would have\ndone in his tent in the midst of the Christian host. He was resolved to\ngive no cause for ill-treatment or complaint to his captors, to work as\nwillingly, as cheerfully, as was in his power, and to seize the first\nopportunity to make his escape, regardless of any risk of his life which\nhe might incur in doing so.\n\nIn the morning the door opened, and a black slave led him into the\ngarden, which was surrounded by a very high and lofty wall. It was large,\nand full of trees and flowers, and far more beautiful than any garden\nthat Cuthbert had seen in his native land. There were various other\nslaves at work; and an Arab, who appeared to be the head of the\ngardeners, at once appointed to Cuthbert the work assigned to him. A\nguard of Arabs with bow and spear watched the doings of the slaves.\n\nWith one glance round, Cuthbert was assured that escape from this garden,\nat least, was not to be thought of, and that for the present, patience\nalone was possible. Dismissing all ideas of that kind from his mind, he\nset to work with a steady attention to his task. He was very fond of\nflowers, and soon he became so absorbed in his work as almost to forget\nthat he was a slave. It was not laborious--digging, planting, pruning and\ntraining the flowers, and giving them copious draughts of water from a\nlarge fountain in the centre of the garden.\n\nThe slaves were not permitted to exchange a word with each other. At the\nend of the day's work they were marched off to separate chambers, or, as\nthey might be called, dungeons. Their food consisted of water, dried\ndates, and bread, and they had little to complain of in this respect;\nindeed, the slaves in the gardens of the governor's house at Jerusalem\nenjoyed an exceptionally favoured existence. The governor himself was\nabsorbed in the cares of the city. The head gardener happened to be a man\nof unusual humanity, and it was really in his hands that the comfort of\nthe prisoners was placed.\n\nSometimes in the course of the day, veiled ladies would issue in groups\nfrom the palace, attended by black slaves with drawn scimitars. They\npassed without unveiling across the point where the slaves were at work,\nand all were forbidden on pain of death to look up, or even to approach\nthe konak or pavilion, where the ladies threw aside their veils, and\nenjoyed the scent and sight of the flowers, the splash of murmuring\nwaters, and the strains of music touched by skilful hands.\n\nAlthough Cuthbert wondered in his heart what these strange wrapped-up\nfigures might look like when the veils were thrown back, he certainly did\nnot care enough about the matter to run any risk of drawing the anger of\nhis guards upon himself by raising his eyes towards them; nor did he ever\nglance up at the palace, which was also interdicted to the slaves. From\nthe lattice casements during the day the strains of music and merry\nlaughter often came down to the captives; but this, if anything, only\nadded to the bitterness of their position, by reminding them that they\nwere shut off for life from ever hearing the laughter of the loved ones\nthey had left behind.\n\nFor upwards of a month Cuthbert remained steadily at work, and during\nthat time no possible plan of escape had occurred to him, and he had\nindeed resigned himself to wait, either until, as he hoped, the city\nwould be taken by the Christians, or until he himself might be removed\nfrom his present post and sent into the country, where, although his\nlot would doubtless be far harder, some chance of escape might open\nbefore him.\n\nOne night, long after slumber had fallen upon the city, Cuthbert was\nstartled by hearing his door open. Rising to his feet, he saw a black\nslave, and an old woman beside him. The latter spoke first in the\nlingua-franca,--\n\n\"My mistress, the wife of the governor, has sent me to ask your story.\nHow is it that, although but a youth, you are already a knight? How is it\nthat you come to be a slave to our people? The sultan himself sent you to\nher lord. She would fain hear through me how it has happened. She is the\nkindest of ladies, and the sight of your youth has touched her heart.\"\n\nWith thanks to the unknown lady who had felt an interest in him, Cuthbert\nbriefly related the events which had led to his captivity. The old woman\nplaced on the ground a basket containing some choice fruit and white\nbread, and then departed with the negro as quietly as she had come,\nleaving Cuthbert greatly pleased at what had taken place.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" he said to himself, \"I shall hear again; and it may be that\nthrough the pity of this lady some means of escape may open to me.\"\n\nAlthough for some little time no such prospect appeared, yet the visits\nof the old woman, which were frequently repeated, were of interest to\nhim, and seemed to form a link between him and the world.\n\nAfter coming regularly every night for a week, she bade the young knight\nfollow her, holding her finger to her lips in sign that caution must be\nobserved. Passing through several passages, he was at length led into a\nroom where a lady of some forty years of age, surrounded by several\nslaves and younger women, was sitting. Cuthbert felt no scruple in making\na deep obeisance to her; the respect shown to women in the days of\nchivalry was very great, and Cuthbert in bowing almost to the ground\nbefore the lady who was really his mistress, did not feel that he was\nhumiliating himself.\n\n\"Young slave,\" she said, \"your story has interested us. We have\nfrequently watched from the windows, and have seen how willingly and\npatiently you have worked; and it seems strange indeed that one so young\nshould have performed such feats of bravery as to win the honour of\nknighthood from the hand of that greatest of warriors, Richard of\nEngland. What is it, we would fain learn from your lips, that stirs up\nthe heart of the Christian world that they should launch their armies\nagainst us, who wish but to be left alone, and who have no grudge against\nthem? This city is as holy to us as it is to you; and as we live around\nit, and all the country for thousands of miles is ours, is it likely that\nwe should allow it to be wrested from us by strangers from a distance?\"\n\nThis was spoken in some Eastern language of which Cuthbert understood no\nword, but its purport was translated to him by the old woman who had\nhitherto acted as his mistress's messenger.\n\nCuthbert reported the circumstances of the fight at Azotus and\nendeavoured to explain the feelings which had given rise to the Crusade.\nHe then, at the orders of the lady, related the incidents of his voyage\nout, and something of his life at home, which was more interesting even\nthan the tale of his adventures to his hearers, as to them the home-life\nof these fierce Christian warriors was entirely unknown.\n\nAfter an audience of two hours Cuthbert was conducted back to his cell,\nhis mistress assuring him of her good-will, and promising to do all in\nher power to make his captivity as light as possible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. AN EFFORT FOR FREEDOM.\n\n\nTwo or three nights afterwards the old woman again came to Cuthbert, and\nasked him, in her mistress's name, if in any way he could suggest a\nmethod of lightening his captivity, as his extreme youth, and bravery of\ndemeanour, had greatly pleased her.\n\nCuthbert replied that nothing but freedom could satisfy his longings;\nthat he was comfortable and not overworked, but that he pined to be back\nagain with his friends.\n\nThe old woman brought him on the following night a message to the\neffect that his mistress would willingly grant him his liberty, but as\nhe was sent to her husband by the sultan, it would be impossible to\nfree him openly.\n\n\"From what she said,\" the old woman continued, \"if you could see some\nplan of making your escape, she would in no way throw difficulties in\nyour path; but it must not be known that the harem in any way connived at\nyour escape, for my lord's wrath would be terrible, and he is not a man\nto be trifled with.\"\n\nLooking round at the high walls that surrounded the garden, Cuthbert said\nthat he could think of no plan whatever for escaping from such a place;\nthat he had often thought it over, but that it appeared to him to be\nhopeless. Even should he manage to scale these walls, he would only find\nhimself in the town beyond, and his escape from that would be altogether\nhopeless. \"Only,\" he said, \"if I were transported to some country palace\nof the governor could I ever hope to make my escape.\" The next night the\nmessenger brought him the news that his mistress was disposed to favour\nhis escape in the way he had pointed out, and that she would in two or\nthree days ask the governor for permission to pay a visit to their palace\nbeyond the walls, and that with her she would take a number of\ngardeners--among them Cuthbert--to beautify the place. Cuthbert returned\nthe most lively and hearty thanks to his patroness for her kind\nintentions, and hope began to rise rapidly in his heart.\n\nIt is probable, however, that the black guards of the harem heard\nsomething of the intentions of their mistress, and that they feared the\nanger of the governor should Cuthbert make his escape, and should it be\ndiscovered that this was the result of her connivance. Either through\nthis or through some other source the governor obtained an inkling that\nthe white slave sent by the sultan was receiving unusual kindness from\nthe ladies of the harem.\n\nTwo nights after Cuthbert had begun to entertain bright hopes of his\nliberty, the door of the cell was softly opened. He was seized by four\nslaves, gagged, tied hand and foot, covered with a thick burnous, and\ncarried out from his cell. By the sound of their feet he heard that they\nwere passing into the open air, and guessed that he was being carried\nthrough the garden; then a door opened and was closed after them; he was\nflung across a horse like a bale of goods, a rope or two were placed\naround him to keep him in that position, and then he felt the animal put\nin motion, and heard by the trampling of feet that a considerable number\nof horsemen were around him. For some time they passed over the rough,\nuneven streets of the city; then there was a pause and exchange of\nwatchword and countersign, a creaking of doors, and a lowering of a\ndrawbridge, and the party issued out into the open country. Not for very\nlong did they continue their way; a halt was called, and Cuthbert was\ntaken off his horse.\n\nOn looking round, he found that he was in the middle of a considerable\ngroup of men. Those who had brought him were a party of the governor's\nguards; but he was now delivered over to a large band of Arabs, all of\nwhom were mounted on camels. One of these creatures he was ordered to\nmount, the bonds being loosed from his arms and feet. An Arab driver,\nwith lance, bows, and arrows, and other weapons, took his seat on the\nneck of the animal, and then with scarcely a word the caravan marched\noff, with noiseless step, and with their faces turned southwards.\n\nIt seemed to Cuthbert almost as a dream. A few hours before he had been\nexalted with the hope of freedom; now he was being taken away to a\nslavery which would probably end but with his life. Although he could not\nunderstand any of his captors, the repetition of a name led him to\nbelieve that he was being sent to Egypt as a present to some man in high\nauthority there; and he doubted not that the Governor of Jerusalem,\nfearing that he might escape, and dreading the wrath of the sultan,\nshould he do so, had determined to transfer the troublesome captive to a\nmore secure position and to safer hands.\n\nFor three days the journey continued; they had now left the fertile\nlowlands of Palestine, and their faces were turned west. They were\nentering upon that sandy waste which stretches between the southern\ncorner of Palestine and the land of Egypt, a distance which can be\ntravelled by camels in three days, but which occupied the Children of\nIsrael forty years.\n\nAt first the watch had been very sharply kept over the captive; but now\nthat they had entered the desert the Arabs appeared to consider that\nthere was no chance of an attempt to escape. Cuthbert had in every way\nendeavoured to ingratiate himself with his guard. He had most willingly\nobeyed their smallest orders, had shown himself pleased and grateful for\nthe dates which formed the staple of their repasts. He had assumed so\ninnocent and quiet an appearance that the Arabs had marvelled much among\nthemselves, and had concluded that there must have been some mistake in\nthe assertion of the governor's guard who had handed the prisoner over to\nthem, that he was one of the terrible knights of King Richard's army.\n\nCuthbert's heart had not fallen for a moment. He knew well that if he\nonce reached Cairo all hope of escape was at an end; and it was before\nreaching that point that he determined if possible to make an effort for\nfreedom. He had noticed particularly the camel which appeared to be the\nfleetest of the band; it was of lighter build than the rest, and it was\nwith difficulty that its rider had compelled it to accommodate itself to\nthe pace of the others. It was clear from the pains he took with it, by\nthe constant patting and the care bestowed upon its watering and\nfeeding, that its rider was extremely proud of it; and Cuthbert\nconcluded that if an escape was to be made, this was the animal on which\nhe must accomplish it.\n\nUpon arriving at the end of each day's journey the camels were allowed\nto browse at will, a short cord being tied between one of their hind and\none of their fore feet. The Arabs then set to work to collect sticks and\nto make a fire--not for cooking, for their only food was dried dates and\nsome black bread, which they brought with them--but for warmth, as the\nnights were damp and somewhat chilly, as they sat round the fire, talked,\nand told stories. Before finally going off to rest, each went out into\nthe bushes and brought in his camel; these were then arranged in a circle\naround the Arabs, one of the latter being mounted as sentry to prevent\nany sudden surprise--not indeed that they had the smallest fear of the\nChristians, who were far distant; but then, as now, the Arabs of the\ndesert were a plundering race, and were ever ready to drive off each\nother's camels or horses. Cuthbert determined that if flight was possible\nit must be undertaken during the interval after the arrival at the\nhalting-place and before the bringing in of the camels. Therefore, each\nday upon the halt he had pretended great fatigue from the rough motion of\nthe camel, and had, after hastily eating the dates handed to him, thrown\nhimself down, covered himself with his Arab robe, and feigned instant\nsleep. Thus they had in the three days from starting come to look upon\nhis presence sleeping close to them as a matter of course.\n\nThe second day after entering the desert, however, Cuthbert threw himself\ndown by the side of an uprooted shrub of small size and about his own\nlength. He covered himself as usual with his long, dark-blue robe, and\npretended to go to sleep. He kept his eyes, however, on the alert through\nan aperture beneath his cloth, and observed particularly the direction in\nwhich the camel upon which he had set his mind wandered into the bushes.\nThe darkness came on a very few minutes after they had halted, and when\nthe Arabs had once settled round their fire, Cuthbert very quietly\nshifted the robe from himself to the long low bush near him, and then\ncrawled stealthily off into the darkness.\n\nHe had no fear of his footfall being heard upon the soft sand, and was\nsoon on his feet, looking for the camels. He was not long in finding\nthem, or in picking out the one which he had selected. The bushes were\nsucculent, and close to the camping ground; indeed, it was for this that\nthe halting-places were always chosen. It was not so easy, however, to\nclimb into the high wooden saddle, and Cuthbert tried several times in\nvain. Then he repeated in a sharp tone the words which he had heard the\nArabs use to order their camels to kneel, striking the animal at the same\nmoment behind the fore-legs with a small switch. The camel immediately\nobeyed the order to which he was accustomed, and knelt down, making,\nhowever, as he did so, the angry grumble which those creatures appear to\nconsider it indispensable to raise when ordered to do anything.\nFortunately this noise is so frequently made, and the camels are so given\nto quarrel among themselves, that although in the still air it might have\nbeen heard by the Arabs sitting a short hundred yards away, it attracted\nno notice, and Cuthbert, climbing into the seat, shook the cord that\nserved as a rein, and the animal, rising, set off at a smooth, steady\nswing in the direction in which his head was turned--that from which they\nhad that day arrived.\n\nOnce fairly away from the camping-ground, Cuthbert, with blows of his\nstick, increased the speed of the camel to a long shuffling trot, and the\nfire in the distance soon faded out into the darkness.\n\nCuthbert trusted to the stars as guides. He was not unarmed, for as he\ncrawled away from his resting-place, he had picked up one of the Arabs'\nspears and bow and arrows, and a large bag of dates from the spot where\nthey had been placed when their owner dismounted. He was already clad in\nEastern garb, and was so sun-burnt and tanned that he had no fear\nwhatever of any one at a distance detecting that he was a white man.\n\nSteering his course by the stars, he rode all night without stopping. He\ndoubted not that he would have at least three hours' start, for the\nArabs were sure to have sat that time round the fires before going out to\nbring in their camels. Even then they would suppose for some time that\nthe animal upon which he was seated had strayed, and no pursuit would be\nattempted until it was discovered that he himself had made his escape,\nwhich might not be for a long time, as the Arabs would not think of\nlooking under the cloth to see if he were there. He hoped, therefore,\nthat he would reach the cultivated land long before he was overtaken. He\nhad little fear but that he should then be able to journey onward without\nattracting attention.\n\nA solitary Arab when travelling rides straight, and his communications to\nthose whom he meets are confined to the set form of two or three words,\n\"May Allah protect you!\" the regular greeting of Moslems when they meet.\n\nWhen morning broke Cuthbert, even when ascending to the top of a somewhat\nlofty mound, could see no signs of pursuers in the vast stretch of desert\nbehind him. In front, the ground was already becoming dotted here and\nthere with vegetation, and he doubted not that after a few hours' ride he\nshould be fairly in the confines of cultivated country. He gave his camel\na meal of dates, and having eaten some himself, again set the creature in\nmotion. These camels, especially those of good breed, will go on for\nthree or four days with scarcely a halt; and there was no fear of that on\nwhich he rode breaking down from fatigue, for the journeys hitherto had\nbeen comparatively short.\n\nBy mid-day Cuthbert had reached the cultivated lands of Palestine. Here\nand there over the plain, villages were dotted, and parties of men and\ncamels were to be seen. Cuthbert now arranged his robes carefully in Arab\nfashion, slung the long spear across his shoulders, and went boldly\nforward at a slinging trot, having little fear that a passer-by would\nhave any suspicion whatever as to his being other than an Arab bent upon\nsome rapid journey. He soon found that his hopes were justified. Several\ntimes he came upon parties of men whom he passed with the salute, and who\nscarcely raised their eyes as he trotted by them. The plain was an open\none, and though cultivated here and there, there were large tracts lying\nunworked. There was no occasion therefore to keep to the road; so riding\nacross country, and avoiding the villages as far as possible, stopping\nonly at a stream to give his camel water, Cuthbert rode without ceasing\nuntil nightfall. Then he halted his camel near a wood, turned it in to\nfeed on the young foliage, and wrapping himself in his burnous was soon\nasleep, for he ached from head to foot with the jolting motion which had\nnow been continued for so many hours without an interval. He had little\nfear of being overtaken by the party he had left behind; they would, he\nwas convinced, be many hours behind, and it was extremely improbable that\nthey would hit upon the exact line which he had followed, so that even if\nthey succeeded in coming up to him, they would probably pass him a few\nmiles either to the right or left.\n\nSo fatigued was he with his long journey, that the next day he slept\nuntil after the sun had risen. He was awakened suddenly by being seized\nby a party of Arabs, who, roughly shaking him, questioned him as to\nwhere he came from, and what he was doing there. He saw at a glance that\nthey were not with the party from which he had escaped, and he pointed to\nhis lips to make signs that he was dumb. The Arabs evidently suspected\nthat something was wrong. They examined the camel, and then the person of\ntheir captive. The whiteness of his skin at once showed them that he was\na Frank in disguise, and without more ado or questioning, they tied him\nhand and foot, flung him across the camel, and, mounting their own\nanimals, rode rapidly away.\n\nFrom the position of the sun, Cuthbert saw that they were making their\ncourse nearly due east, and therefore that it could not be their\nintention to take him to Jerusalem, which was to the north of the line\nthey were following. A long day's journeying, which to Cuthbert seemed\ninterminable, found them on the low spit of sand which runs along by the\nside of the Dead Sea. Behind, lofty rocks rose almost precipitously, but\nthrough a cleft in these the Arabs had made their way. Cuthbert saw at\nonce that they belonged to some desert tribe over whom the authority of\nSuleiman was but nominal. When summoned for any great effort, these\nchildren of the desert would rally to his armies and fight for a short\ntime; but at the first disaster, or whenever they became tired of the\ndiscipline and regularity of the army, they would mount their camels and\nreturn to the desert, generally managing on the way to abstract from the\nfarms of those on their route either a horse, cattle, or some other\nobjects which would pay them for the labours they had undergone.\n\nThey were now near the confines of their own country, and apparently had\nno fear whatever of pursuit. They soon gathered some of the dead wood\ncast on the shores of the sea, and with these a fire was speedily\nlighted, and an earthenware pot was taken down from among their baggage:\nit was filled with water from a skin, and then grain having been placed\nin it, it was put among the wood ashes. Cuthbert, who was weary and\naching in every limb from the position in which he had been placed on\nthe camel, asked them by signs for permission to bathe in the lake.\nThis was given, principally apparently from curiosity, for but very few\nArabs were able to swim; indeed, as a people they object so utterly to\nwater, that the idea of any one bathing for his amusement was to them a\nmatter of ridicule.\n\nCuthbert, who had never heard of the properties of the Dead Sea, was\nperfectly astonished upon entering the water to find that instead of\nwading in it up to the neck before starting-to swim, as he was accustomed\nto do at home, the water soon after he got waist-deep took him off his\nfeet, and a cry of astonishment burst from him as he found himself on\nrather than in the fluid. The position was so strange and unnatural that\nwith a cry of alarm he scrambled over on to his feet, and made the best\nof his way to shore, the Arabs indulging in shouts of laughter at his\nastonishment and alarm. Cuthbert was utterly unable to account for the\nstrange sensations he had experienced; he perceived that the water was\nhorribly salt, and that which had got into his mouth almost choked him.\nHe was, however, unaware that saltness adds to the weight of water, and\nso to the buoyancy of objects cast into it. The saltness of the fluid he\nwas moreover painfully conscious of by the smarting of the places on his\nwrists and ankles where the cords had been bound that fastened him to the\ncamel. Goaded, however, by the laughter of the Arabs, he determined once\nmore to try the experiment of entering this strange sheet of water, which\nfrom some unaccountable cause appeared to him to refuse to allow anybody\nto sink in it. This time he swam about for some time, and felt a little\nrefreshed. When he returned to the shore he soon re-attired himself in\nhis Bedouin dress, and seated himself a little distance from his captors,\nwho were now engaged in discussing the materials prepared by themselves.\nThey made signs to Cuthbert that he might partake of their leavings, for\nwhich he was not a little grateful, for he felt utterly exhausted and\nworn out with his cruel ride and prolonged fasting.\n\nThe Arabs soon wrapped themselves in their burnouses, and feeling\nconfident that their captive would not attempt to escape from them, in a\nplace where subsistence would be impossible, paid no further attention to\nhim beyond motioning to him to lie down at their side.\n\nCuthbert, however, determined to make another effort to escape; for\nalthough he was utterly ignorant of the place in which he found himself,\nor of the way back, he thought that anything would be better than to be\ncarried into helpless slavery into the savage country beyond the Jordan.\nAn hour, therefore, after his captors were asleep he stole to his feet,\nand fearing to arouse them by exciting the wrath of one of the camels by\nattempting to mount him, he struck up into the hills on foot. All night\nhe wandered, and in the morning found himself at the edge of a strange\nprecipice falling abruptly down to a river, which, some fifty feet wide,\nran at its foot. Upon the opposite side the bank rose with equal\nrapidity, and to Cuthbert's astonishment he saw that the cliffs were\nhoneycombed by caves.\n\nKeeping along the edge for a considerable distance, he came to a spot\nwhere it was passable, and made his way down to the river bank. Here he\nindulged in a long drink of fresh water, and then began to examine the\ncaves which perforated the rocks. These caves Cuthbert knew had formerly\nbeen the abode of hermits. It was supposed to be an essentially sacred\nlocality, and between the third and fourth centuries of Christianity some\n20,000 monks had lived solitary lives on the banks of that river. Far\naway he saw the ruins of a great monastery, called Mar Saba, which had\nfor a long time been the abode of a religious community, and which at the\npresent day is still tenanted by a body of monks. Cuthbert made up his\nmind at once to take refuge in these caves. He speedily picked out one\nsome fifty feet up the face of the rock, and approachable only with the\ngreatest difficulty and by a sure foot. First he made the ascent to\ndiscover the size of the grotto, and found that although the entrance was\nbut four feet high and two feet wide, it opened into an area of\nconsiderable dimensions. Far in the corner, when his eyes became\naccustomed to the light, he discovered a circle of ashes, and his\nconjectures that these caves had been the abode of men were therefore\nverified. He again descended, and collected a large bundle of grass and\nrushes for his bed. He discovered growing among the rocks many edible\nplants, whose seeds were probably sown there centuries before, and\ngathering some of these he made his way back to the cavern. The grass\nfurnished him with an excellent bed, and he was soon asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. A HERMIT'S TALE.\n\n\nThe next day he discovered on his excursions plenty of eatable berries on\nthe bushes; and now that he had no longer fear of hunger he resolved to\nstay for some little time, until his wounds, which had festered badly,\nhad recovered, before making an attempt to rejoin the Christian army.\n\nOne day when employed in gathering berries he was surprised by meeting a\nwild-looking figure, who appeared suddenly from one of the caves. It was\nthat of a very old man, with an extremely long white beard flowing to his\nwaist; his hair, which was utterly unkempt, fell to the same point. He\nwas thin to an extraordinary extent, and Cuthbert wondered how a man\ncould have been reduced to such a state of starvation, with so plentiful\na supply of fruit and berries at hand.\n\nThe old man looked at Cuthbert attentively, and then made the sign of the\ncross. Cuthbert gave a cry of joy, and repeated the sign. The old man at\nonce came down from his cavern, and looked at him with surprise and\nastonishment, and then addressed him in the French language.\n\n\"Are you a Christian truly; and if so, whence do you come?\"\n\nCuthbert at once explained that he had been taken prisoner when with King\nRichard's army, and had effected his escape. He also told the old man\nthat he had been remaining for the last four days in a cave higher up the\nstream. The hermit--for he was one--beckoned him to follow him, and\nCuthbert found himself in a cave precisely similar to that which he\nhimself inhabited. There were no signs of comfort of any kind; a\nbed-place made of great stones stood in one corner, and Cuthbert,\nremembering the comforts of his own grassy couch, shuddered at the\nthought of the intense discomfort of such a sleeping-place. In another\ncorner was an altar, upon which stood a rough crucifix, before which the\nhermit knelt at once in prayer, Cuthbert following his example. Rising\nagain, the hermit motioned to him to sit down, and then began a\nconversation with him.\n\nIt was so long since the hermit had spoken to any living being, that he\nhad almost lost the use of his tongue, and his sentences were slow and\nill-formed. However, Cuthbert was able to understand him, and he to\ngather the drift of what Cuthbert told him. The old man then showed him,\nthat by touching a stone in the corner of his cave the apparently solid\nrock opened, and revealed an entrance into an inner cave, which was lit\nby a ray of light, which penetrated from above.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"was made centuries ago, and was intended as a refuge\nfrom the persecutors of that day.  The caves were then almost all\ninhabited by hermits, and although many recked not of their lives, and\nwere quite ready to meet death through the knife of the infidel, others\nclung to existence, and preferred to pass many years of penance on earth\nfor the sake of atoning for their sins before called upon to appear\nbefore their Maker.\n\n\"If you are pursued, it will be safer for you to take up your abode here.\nI am known to all the inhabitants of this country, who look upon me as\nmad, and respect me accordingly. None ever interfere with me, or with the\ntwo or three other hermits, the remains of what was once almost an army,\nwho now alone survive. I can offer you no hospitality beyond that of a\nrefuge; but there is water in the river below, fruits and berries in\nabundance on the shrubs. What would you have more?\"\n\nCuthbert accepted the invitation with thanks; for he thought that even at\nthe worst the presence of this holy man would be a protection to him from\nany Arabs who might discover him.\n\nFor three or four days he resided with the hermit, who, although he\nstretched his long lean body upon the hard stones of his bed, and passed\nmany hours of the night kneeling on the stone floor in front of his\nalter, yet had no objection to Cuthbert making himself as comfortable as\nhe could under the circumstances.\n\nAt the end of the fourth day Cuthbert asked him how long he had been\nthere, and how he came to take up his abode in so desolate and fearsome a\nplace. The hermit was silent for a time, and then said,--\n\n\"It is long indeed since my thoughts have gone back to the day when I was\nof the world. I know not whether it would not be a sin to recall them;\nbut I will think the matter over to-night, and if it appears to me that\nyou may derive good from my narrative, I will relate it to you\nto-morrow.\"\n\nThe next day Cuthbert did not renew the request, leaving it to the hermit\nto speak should he think fit. It was not until the evening that he\nalluded to the subject; and then taking his seat on a bank near the edge\nof the river, he motioned to Cuthbert to sit beside him, and began,--\n\n\"My father was a peer of France, and I was brought up at the court.\nAlthough it may seem strange to you, looking upon this withered frame,\nsixty-five years back I was as bold and comely a knight as rode in the\ntrain of the king, for I am now past ninety, and for sixty years I have\nresided here. I was a favourite of the king's, and he loaded me with\nwealth and honour. He, too, was young, and I joined with him in the mad\ncarousals and feastings of the court. My father resided for the most part\nat one of his castles in the country, and I, an only son, was left much\nto myself. I need not tell you that I was as wild and as wicked as all\nthose around me; that I thought little of God, and feared neither Him nor\nman.\n\n\"It chanced that one of the nobles--I need not mention his name--whose\ncastle lay in the same province as that of my father, had a lovely\ndaughter, who, being an only child, would be his heiress. She was\nconsidered one of the best matches in France, and reports of her\nexceeding beauty had reached the court. Although my allowance from my\nfather, and from the estates which the king had give me personally,\nshould have been more than enough for my utmost wants, gambling and\nriotous living swallowed up my revenue faster than it came in, and I was\nconstantly harassed by debt.\n\n\"Talking one night at supper with a number of bold companions, as to the\nmeans we should take for restoring our wasted fortunes, some said in jest\nthat the best plan would be for one of us to marry the beauty of\nDauphiny. I at once said that I would be the man to do it; the ideas was\na wild one, and a roar of laughter greeted my words. Her father was known\nto be a stern and rigid man, and it was certain that he would not consent\nto give his daughter to a spendthrift young noble like myself. When the\nlaughter had subsided I repeated my intention gravely, and offered to\nwager large sums with all around the table that I would succeed.\n\n\"On the morrow I packed up a few of my belongings, put in my valise the\ndress of a wandering troubadour, and taking with me only a trusty\nservant, started for Dauphiny. It would be tedious to tell you the means\nI resorted to to obtain the affections of the heiress. I had been well\ninstructed in music and could play on the lute, and knew by heart large\nnumbers of ballads, and could myself, in case of necessity, string verses\ntogether with tolerable ease. As a troubadour I arrived at the castle\ngate, and craved permission to enter to amuse its occupants. Troubadours\nthen, as now, were in high esteem in the south, and I was at once made a\nwelcome guest.\n\n\"Days passed, and weeks; still I lingered at the castle, my heart being\nnow as much interested as my pride in the wager which I had undertaken.\nSuffice it to say, that my songs, and perhaps my appearance--for I cannot\nbe accused of vanity now in saying nature had been bountiful to me--won\nmy way to her heart. Troubadours were licensed folk, and even in her\nfather's presence there was nought unseemly in my singing songs of love.\nWhile he took them as the mere compliments of a troubadour, the lady, I\nsaw, read them as serious effusions of my heart.\n\n\"It was only occasionally that we met alone; but ere long she confessed\nthat she loved me. Without telling her my real name, I disclosed to her\nthat I was of her own rank, and that I had entered upon the disguise I\nwore in order to win her love. She was romantic, and was flattered by my\ndevotion. I owned to her that hitherto I had been wild and reckless; and\nshe told me at once that her father destined her for the son of an old\nfriend of his, to whom it appeared she had been affianced while still a\nbaby. She was positive that nothing would move her father. For the man\nshe was to marry she entertained no kind of affection, and indeed had\nnever seen him, as she had been brought up in a convent to the age of\nfifteen; and just before she had returned thence, he had gone to finish\nhis education at Padua.\n\n\"She trembled when I proposed flight; but I assured her that I was\ncertain of the protection of the king, and that he would, I was sure,\nwhen the marriage was once celebrated, use his influence with her father\nto obtain his forgiveness.\n\n\"The preparations for her flight were not long in making. I purchased a\nfleet horse in addition to my own, and ordered my servant to bring it to\na point a short distance from the castle gate. I had procured a long rope\nwith which to lower her down from her lattice to the moat below, which\nwas at present dry, intending myself to slide after her. The night chosen\nwas one when I knew that the count was to have guests, and I thought that\nthey would probably, as is the custom, drink heavily, and that there\nwould be less fear of any watch being kept.\n\n\"The guests arrived just at nightfall. I had feigned illness, and kept my\nroom. From time to time I heard through the windows of the banqueting\nhall bursts of laughter. These gradually ceased; and at last, when all\nwas still, I, awaiting some time, stole from my room with a rope in my\nhand to the apartment occupied by her. A slight tap at the door, as\narranged, was at once answered, and I found her ready cloaked and\nprepared for the enterprise. She trembled from head to foot, but I\ncheered her to the best of my power, and at last she was in readiness to\nbe lowered. The window was at a considerable height from the ground; but\nthe rope was a long one, and I had no fear of its reaching the bottom.\nFastening it round her waist, I began to lower her from the window.\n\n\"The night was a windy one, and she swung backwards and forwards as she\nwent down. By what chance it was I know not,--for I had examined the\nrope and found it secure--but methinks in swaying backwards and\nforwards it may have caught a sharp stone, maybe it was a punishment\nfrom Heaven upon me for robbing a father of his child--but suddenly I\nfelt there was no longer a weight on my arms. A fearful shriek rang\nthrough the air, and, looking out, I saw far below a white figure\nstretched senseless in the mud!\n\n\"For a minute I stood paralyzed. But the cry had aroused others, and,\nturning round, I saw a man at the door with a drawn sword. Wild with\ngrief and despair, and thinking, not of making my escape, or of\nconcealing my part in what had happened, but rushing without an instant's\ndelay to the body of her I loved so well, I drew my sword, and like a\nmadman rushed upon him who barred the door. The combat was brief but\nfurious, and nerved by the madness of despair I broke down his guard and\nran him through the body. As he fell back, his face came in the full\nlight of the moon, which streamed through the open door of the passage,\nand to my utter horror and bewilderment I saw that I had slain my father.\n\n\"What happened after that night I know not. I believe that I made my\nescape from the castle and rushed round to the body of her whose life I\nhad destroyed, and that there finding her dead, I ran wildly across the\ncountry. When I came to my senses months had passed, and I was the inmate\nof an asylum for men bereaved of their senses, kept by noble monks. Here\nfor two years I remained, the world believing that I was dead. None knew\nthat the troubadour whose love had cost the lady her life, who had slain\nthe guest of her father, and had then disappeared, was the unhappy son of\nthat guest. My friends in Paris when they heard of the tragedy of course\nassociated it with me, but they all kept silent. The monks, to whom I\nconfessed the whole story, were shocked indeed, but consoled me in my\ngrief and despair by the assurance that however greatly I had sinned, the\ndeath of the lady had been accidental, and that if I were a parricide it\nwas at least unintentionally.\n\n\"My repentance was deep and sincere; and after a while, under another\nname, I joined the army of the crusaders, to expiate my sin by warring\nfor the holy sepulchre. I fought as men fight who have no wish to live;\nbut while all around me fell by sword and disease, death kept aloof from\nme. When the crusade had failed I determined to turn for ever from the\nworld, and to devote my life to prayer and penance; and so casting aside\nmy armour, I made my way here, and took up my abode in a cave in this\nvalley, where at that time were many thousands of other hermits--for the\nSaracens, while they gained much money from fines and exactions from\npilgrims who came to Jerusalem, and fought stoutly against those who\nsought to capture that city, were in the main tolerant, and offered no\nhindrance to the community of men whom they looked upon as mad.\n\n\"Here, my son, for more than sixty years have I prayed, with much\nfasting and penance. I trust now that the end is nearly at hand, and\nthat my long life of mortification may be deemed to have obliterated the\nevil deeds which I did in my youth. Let my fate be a warning to you.\nWalk steadily in the right way; indulge not in feasting and evil\ncompanionship; and above all, do not enter upon evil deeds, the end of\nwhich no man can see.\"\n\nThe hermit was silent, and Cuthbert, seeing that his thoughts had again\nreferred to the past, wandered away, and left him sitting by the river\nside. Some hours later he returned, and found the hermit kneeling before\nthe altar; and the next morning the latter said,--\n\n\"I presume, my son, you do not wish to remain here as a hermit, as I have\ndone? Methinks it were well that we made our arrangements for your return\nto the Christian host, who will, I hope, ere long be at the gates of\nJerusalem.\"\n\n\"I should like nothing better,\" Cuthbert said. \"But ignorant as I am of\nthe nature of the country, it seems to be nigh impossible to penetrate\nthrough the hosts of the Saracens to reach the camp of King Richard.\"\n\n\"The matter is difficult and not without danger,\" the hermit said. \"As to\nthe nature of the country, I myself know but little, for my dealings with\nthe natives have been few and simple. There are, however, several\nChristian communities dwelling among the heathen. They are poor, and are\nforced to live in little-frequented localities. Their Christianity may be\nsuspected by their neighbours, but as they do no man harm, and carry on\ntheir worship in secret, they are little interfered with. There is one\ncommunity among the hills between this and Jerusalem, and I can give you\ninstructions for reaching this, together with a token which will secure\nyou hospitality there, and they will no doubt do their best to forward\nyou to another station. When you approach the flat country where the\narmies are maneuvering you must doubtless trust to yourself; but as far\nas the slopes extend, methinks that our friends will be able to pass you\nwithout great difficulty.\"\n\nCuthbert's heart rose greatly at the prospect of once again entering upon\nan active life, and the next evening, with many thanks for his kindness,\nhe knelt before the aged hermit to receive his blessing.\n\nWith the instructions given him he had no difficulty in making his way\nthrough the mountains, until after some five hours' walk he found himself\nat a little village situated in a narrow valley.\n\nGoing to the door of the principal hut, he knocked, and upon entering\nshowed the owner--who opened the door--a rosette of peculiar beads, and\nrepeated the name of Father Anselm. The peasant at once recognized it,\nand bade Cuthbert welcome. He knew but a few words of French, although\ndoubtless his ancestors had been of European extraction. In the morning\nhe furnished Cuthbert with the sheepskin and short tunic which formed the\ndress of a shepherd, and dyeing his limbs and face a deep brown, he\nhimself started with Cuthbert on his journey to the next Christian\ncommunity.\n\nThis was a small one, consisting of two huts only, built almost on the\nsummit of a mountain, the inhabitants living partly on the milk and\ncheese of their goats, and partly upon the scanty vegetables which grew\naround the huts.\n\nHis welcome was as cordial as that of the night before; and the next\nmorning, his former guide taking leave of him, the peasant in whose house\nhe had slept, again conducted him forward to another community. This was\nthe last station, and stood in a narrow gorge on the face of the hills\nlooking down over the plain, beyond which in the far distance a faint\nline of blue sea was visible.\n\nThis community was far more prosperous and well-to-do than those at which\nthe previous nights had been passed. The head of the village appeared to\nbe a personage of some importance; and although clinging in secret to his\nChristian faith, he and his belongings had so far adopted the usages of\nthe Mussulmen that apparently no thought of their Christianity entered\ninto the minds of the authorities. He was the owner of two or three\nhorses, and of some extensive vineyards and olive grounds. He was also\nable to speak French with some degree of fluency.\n\nAt considerable length he explained to Cuthbert the exact position of the\nChristian army, which had moved some distance along the coast since\nCuthbert had left it. It was, he said, exposed to constant attacks by the\nSaracens, who harassed it in every way, and permitted it no repose. He\nsaid that the high hopes which had been raised by the defeat of the\nSaracens at Azotus, had now fallen, and that it was feared the Christians\nwould not be able to force their way forward to Jerusalem. The great\nportion of their animals had died, and the country was so eaten up by the\nSaracen hosts, that an advance upon Jerusalem without a large baggage\ntrain was next to impossible; and indeed if the Christians were to arrive\nbefore that city, they could effect nothing without the aid of the heavy\nmachines necessary for battering the walls or effecting an escalade.\n\nCuthbert was vastly grieved when he heard of the probable failure of the\nexpedition, and he burned with eagerness to take his part again in the\ndangers and difficulties which beset the Christian army. His host pointed\nout to him the extreme difficulty and danger of his crossing the enemy's\nlines, but at the same time offered to do all in his power to assist him.\nAfter two days' stay at the village, and discussing the pros and cons of\nall possible plans, it was decided that the best chance lay in a bold\neffort. The host placed at his disposal one of his horses, together with\nsuch clothes as would enable him to ride as an Arab chief of rank and\nstation; a long lance was furnished him, a short and heavy mace, and\nscimitar; a bag of dates was hung at the saddle-bow; and with the\nsincerest thanks to his protector, and with a promise that should the\nChristian host win their way to Jerusalem the steed should be returned\nwith ample payment, Cuthbert started on his journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A FIGHT OF HEROES.\n\n\nThe horse was a good and spirited one, and when he had once descended to\nthe plains, Cuthbert rode gaily along, exulting in his freedom, and in\nonce again possessing arms to defend himself should it be needed. His\nappearance was so exactly that of the horsemen who were continually\npassing and repassing that no observation whatever was attracted by it.\nThrough villages, and even through camps, Cuthbert rode fearlessly, and\narrived, without having once been accosted, near the main camp of the\nSaracens, which extended for miles parallel to the sea. But at a distance\nof some three leagues beyond, could be seen the white tents of the\nChristian host, and Cuthbert felt that the time of trial was now at hand.\n\nHe dismounted for an hour to allow his steed to rest itself, fed it with\ndates from his wallet, and gave it a drink of water at the stream. Then,\nwhen he felt that it had thoroughly recovered its strength and freshness,\nhe re-mounted, and rode briskly on as before. He passed unchallenged,\nattracting no more notice than a person now-a-days would do in walking\nalong a crowded street. Without hesitation he passed through the tents\nand started across the open country. Bands of horsemen were seen here and\nthere, some going, and some coming from the direction of the Christian\ncamp. As it was doubtless supposed that he was on his way to join some\nband that had gone on in advance, the passage of the solitary horseman\nexcited no comment until he approached within about two miles of the\nChristian camp. There were now, so far as he could see, no enemies\nbetween him and the point he so longed to gain. But at this minute a\ngroup of Arab horsemen, gathered, apparently on the look-out against any\nmovement of the Christians, shouted to him \"Halt!\" demanding whither he\nwas going.\n\nUp to this point Cuthbert had ridden at a gentle canter; but at the\nchallenge he put spurs into his steed and made across the plain at full\nspeed. With a wild yell the Arabs started in pursuit. They lay at first\nsome 200 yards on his right, and he had therefore a considerable start of\nthem. His horse was fairly fresh, for the journey that he had made had\nonly been about fifteen miles--an inconsiderable distance to an Arab\nsteed. For half a mile he did not think that his pursuers gained much\nupon him, riding as they had done sideways. They had now gathered in his\nrear, and the nearest was some 150 yards behind him. A quarter of a mile\nfarther he again looked round, and found that two of the Arabs, far\nbetter mounted than the others, had come within half the distance which\nseparated them from him when he last glanced back. His horse was\nstraining to the utmost, and he felt that it could do no more; he\ntherefore prepared himself for a desperate fight should his pursuers\novertake him. In another quarter of a mile they were but a short distance\nbehind, and an arrow whizzing by Cuthbert's ear told him they had\nbe-taken themselves to their bows.\n\nHalf a mile ahead he saw riding towards him a group of Christian knights;\nbut he felt that it was too late for him to hope to reach them, and that\nhis only chance now was to boldly encounter his pursuers. The main body\nof the Arabs was fully 200 yards behind--a short distance when going at a\ngallop--which left him but little time to shake off the pursuit of the\ntwo immediately behind him.\n\nA sharp stinging pain in his leg told him that it was time to make his\neffort; and checking his horse, he wheeled suddenly round. The two Arabs\nwith a yell rode at him with pointed lance. With his right hand Cuthbert\ngrasped the short heavy mace which hung at his saddle-bow, and being well\npractised in the hurling of this weapon--which formed part of the\neducation of a good knight--he cast it with all his force at the chest of\nthe Arab approaching on that side. The point of the spear was within a\nfew yards of his breast as he flung the mace; but his aim was true, for\nit smote the Saracen full on the chest, and hurled him from his horse as\nif struck with a thunderbolt. At the same instant Cuthbert threw himself\nflat on the neck of his steed and the lance of the Arab who came up on\nthe other side passed harmlessly between his shoulders, tearing his\nclothes as it went. In an instant Cuthbert had wheeled his horse, and\nbefore the Arab could turn his steed Cuthbert, coming up from behind,\nhad run him through the body.\n\nShort as the delay had been, the main body of the pursuers were scarcely\nfifty yards away; but Cuthbert now continued his flight towards the\nknights, who were galloping forward at full speed; and a moment\nafterwards glancing back, he saw that his pursuers had turned and were in\nfull flight.\n\nWith a shout of joy he rode forward to the party who had viewed with\nastonishment this conflict between what appeared to be three of the\ninfidels. Even louder than his first shout of exultation was the cry of\njoy which he raised at seeing among the party to whom he rode up, the\nEarl of Evesham, who reined in his horse in astonishment, and drew his\nsword as the supposed enemy galloped towards him.\n\n\"My lord, my lord!\" Cuthbert said. \"Thank heaven I am safe with\nyou again.\"\n\nThe earl lowered his sword in astonishment.\n\n\"Am I mad,\" he said, \"or dreaming, or is this really Sir Cuthbert?\"\n\n\"It is I sure enough,\" Cuthbert exclaimed, \"although truly I look more\nlike a Bedouin soldier than a Christian knight.\"\n\n\"My dear boy!\" exclaimed the earl, galloping forward and throwing his\narms around Cuthbert's neck, \"we thought you were dead. But by what\nwonderful fortune have you succeeded in escaping?\"\n\nIn a few words Cuthbert related the principal incidents of his\nadventures, and he was heartily congratulated by the assembled knights.\n\nThere was, however, no time for long explanations. Large bodies of the\nSaracen horse were already sweeping down, to capture, if possible, this\nsmall band of knights who had ventured so far from the camp; and as King\nRichard's orders were that none should venture upon conflicts except by\nhis orders, the party reluctantly turned their horses and galloped back\nto the camp.\n\nGreat as had been the earl's joy, it was, if possible, exceeded by that\nof Cnut on discovering in the Arab chief who rode up alongside the earl,\nthe lad he loved so well. Loud and hearty were the cheers which rang out\nfrom the earl's camp as the news spread, and Cuthbert was compelled to\nshake hands with the whole party before entering the earl's tent, to\nrefresh himself and give the narrative of what had happened.\n\nCuthbert, retiring to his tent with the Earl of Evesham, inquired of him\nwhat had taken place during his absence.\n\n\"For,\" he said, \"although but a short three days' march from here, I have\nbeen as one of the dead, and have heard nothing whatever of what has\ntaken place.\"\n\n\"Nothing could have gone worse,\" the earl said. \"We have had nothing\nbut dissensions and quarrels. First, the king fell out with the\nArchduke of Austria.\"\n\n\"On what ground did this happen?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"For once,\" the earl said, \"the king our master was wholly in the wrong,\nwhich is not generally the case. We had just taken Ascalon, and were hard\nat work fortifying the place. King Richard with his usual zeal, in order\nto encourage the army, seized heavy stones and himself bore them into\ntheir place. The Archduke stood near with some of his knights: and it may\nbe that the haughty Austrian looked somewhat superciliously at our king,\nthus labouring.\n\n\"'Why do you not make a show of helping?' King Richard said, going up to\nhim. 'It would encourage the men, and show that the labour upon which we\nare engaged can be undertaken by all without derogation.'\n\n\"To this the Archduke replied,--\n\n\"'I am not the son of a mason!'\n\n\"Whereupon Richard, whose blood no doubt had been excited by the air of\nthe Austrian, struck him with his hand a fierce blow across the face. We\nnearly betook ourselves to our swords on both sides; but King Richard\nhimself could have scattered half the Austrians, and these, knowing that\nagainst his impetuous valour they could do nothing, simply withdrew from\nour camp, and sailed the next day for home. Then the king, in order to\nconciliate some at least of his allies, conferred the crown of Jerusalem\nupon Conrad of Montferat. No sooner had he done this than Conrad was\nmysteriously wounded. By whom it was done none knew. Some say that it was\nby emissaries of the Old Man of the Mountain. Others affirm that it was\nthe jealousy of some of the knights of the holy orders. But be that as it\nmay, he died. Some of the French, ever jealous of the valour of our king,\nascribed it to his orders. This monstrous accusation coming to the ears\nof King Richard, he had hot words with the Duke of Burgundy. In this I\nblame him not, for it is beyond all reason that a man like the king,\nwhose faults, such as they are, arise from too much openness, and from\nthe want of concealment of such dislikes as he may have, should resort to\npoison to free himself of a man whom he himself had but a day or two\nbefore appointed King of Jerusalem. However it be, the consequences were\nmost unfortunate, for the result of the quarrel was that the Duke of\nBurgundy and his Frenchmen followed the example of the Austrians, and we\nwere left alone. Before this we had marched upon Jerusalem. But the\nweather had been so bad, and our train was so insufficient to carry the\nengines of war, that we had been forced to fall back again. King Richard\nagain advanced, and with much toil we went as far as the village of\nBethany.\"\n\n\"Why,\" Cuthbert exclaimed, \"I passed through that village, and it is but\nthree miles from the holy city.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" the earl said; \"and many of us, ascending the hill in\nfront, saw Jerusalem. But even then it was certain that we must again\nretrace our steps; and when we asked King Richard to come to the crest of\nthe hill to see the holy city, he refused to do so, saying, 'No; those\nwho are not worthy of conquering Jerusalem should not look at it!' This\nwas but a short time since, and we are now retracing our steps to Acre,\nand are treating with Saladin for a peace.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Cuthbert said sadly, \"all our hopes and efforts are thrown away;\nall this blood has been shed for nothing; and after the three great\npowers of Europe have engaged themselves solemnly in the war, we are\nbaffled, and have to fall back before the hordes of the infidels.\"\n\n\"Partly before them,\" the earl said, \"partly as the result of our own\njealousies and passions. Had King Richard been a lesser man than he is,\nwe might have conquered Jerusalem. But he is so extraordinary a warrior\nthat his glory throws all others into the shade. He is a good general,\nperhaps the best in Europe; and had he done nothing but lead, assuredly\nwe should have carried out our purpose. See how ably he maneuvered the\narmy at the fight of Azotus. Never was a more complete defeat than that\nwhich he inflicted there upon the Saracens; and although the fact that\nhis generalship achieved this, might have caused some jealousy to the\nother commanders, this might have died away could he between the battles\nhave been a general, and nothing more. But alas! he is in addition a\nknight-errant--and such a knight-errant as Europe has never seen before.\nWherever there is danger, Richard will plunge into the midst. There are\nbrave men in all the three armies; but the strongest and bravest are as\nchildren to King Richard. Alone he can dart into ranks of the infidels,\nand cut a lane for himself by the strength of his right arm. More than\nthis, when danger has threatened he has snatched up his battle-axe and\ndashed into the fray without helm or cuirass, performing such prodigies\nof valour and strength that it has been to his prowess alone that victory\nwas to be ascribed. Hence he is the idol of all the soldiers, whatever\ntheir nationality; for he is as ready to rush to the rescue of a French\nor Austrian knight when pressed as to that of his own men. But the\ndevotion which the whole army felt for him was as gall and wormwood to\nthe haughty Austrian and the indolent Frenchman; and the retirement of\nthe King of France, which left Richard in supreme command, was in every\nway unfortunate.\"\n\nUpon the following day the army again marched, and Cuthbert could not but\nnotice the difference, not only in number but in demeanour, from the\nsplendid array which had left Acre a few months before. There was little\nnow of the glory of pennon and banner; the bright helms and cuirasses\nwere rusted and dinted, and none seemed to care aught for bravery of\nshow. The knights and men-at-arms were sunburnt and thin, and seemed but\nhalf the weight that they had been when they landed. Fatigue, hardship,\nand the heat had done their work; disease had swept off vast numbers. But\nthe remains of the army were so formidable in their fighting powers that\nthe Saracens, although following them at a distance in vast numbers, did\nnot venture an attack upon them.\n\nA few days after their arrival at Acre, the king gave orders for the\nembarcation of the troops. Just as they were preparing to enter the ships\na small vessel was seen entering the harbour. It drew up to the shore,\nand a knight leaped from it, and, inquiring where King Richard was to be\nfound, made his way to the king, who was standing superintending the\nembarcation of some of the horses.\n\n\"The Saracens, sire!\" he exclaimed. \"The Saracens are besieging Jaffa,\nand the place must be lost unless assistance arrives in a day or two.\"\n\nThe king leaped on board the nearest ship, shouted to his leading\nofficers to follow him, and gave orders to others to bring down the\ntroops with all possible speed, to waste not a moment, and to see that\nall was done, and then, in five minutes after the receipt of the news he\nstarted for Jaffa. The Earl of Evesham and Cuthbert had been standing\nnear the king when the order was given, and followed him at once on board\nthe bark which he had chosen.\n\n\"Ah, my gallant young knight,\" the king exclaimed, \"I am right glad to\nsee you with me. We shall have more fighting before we have done, and I\nknow that that suits your mood as well as my own.\"\n\nThe king's vessel was far in advance of any of the others, when early the\nfollowing morning it arrived at Jaffa.\n\n\"Your eyes are better than mine,\" the king said to Cuthbert. \"Tell me\nwhat is that flag flying on the top of the town.\"\n\nCuthbert looked at it earnestly.\n\n\"I fear, sire, that it is the crescent. We have arrived too late.\"\n\n\"By the holy cross,\" said King Richard, \"that shall not be so; for if the\nplace be taken, we will retake it.\"\n\nAs the vessel neared the shore a monk ran out into the water up to his\nshoulders, and said to the king that the citadel still held out, and that\neven now the Saracens might be driven back. Without delay the king leaped\ninto the water, followed by the knights and men-at-arms, and entering the\ngate, threw himself upon the infidels within, who, busy plundering, had\nnot noticed the arrival of the ship.\n\nThe war cry of \"St. George! St. George!\" which the king always shouted\nin battle, struck panic among the infidels; and although the king was\nfollowed but by five knights and a few men-at-arms, the Saracens, to\nthe number of 3000, fled before him, and all who tarried were smitten\ndown. The king followed them out upon the plain, driving them before\nhim as a lion would drive a flock of sheep, and then returned\ntriumphant into the city.\n\nThe next day, some more ships having arrived, King Richard found that in\nall, including the garrison, he could muster 2000 combatants. The enemy\nrenewed the attack in great numbers, and the assaults upon the walls were\ncontinuous and desperate. King Richard, who loved fighting in the plain\nrather than behind walls, was impatient at this, and at one time so\nfierce was the attack that he resolved to sally out. Only ten horses\nremained in the town, and King Richard, mounting one, called upon nine of\nthe knights to mount and sally out with him. The little band of ten\nwarriors charged down upon the host of the Saracens and swept them before\nthem. It was a marvellous sight indeed to see so small a group of\nhorsemen dashing through a crowd of Saracen warriors. These, although at\nfirst beaten back, yet rallied, and the ten knights had great difficulty\nin fighting their way back to the town. When near the walls the\nChristians again made a stand, and a few knights sallied out from the\ntown on foot and joined them. Among these was Cuthbert, the Earl of\nEvesham having accompanied King Richard in his charge. In all, seventeen\nknights were now rallied round the king. So fierce was the charge of the\nSaracens that the king ordered those on horseback to dismount, and with\ntheir horses in the centre, the little body knelt with their lances\nopposed to the Saracens. Again and again the wild cavalry swept down upon\nthis little force, but in vain did they attempt to break their ranks. The\nscene was indeed an extraordinary one. At last the king, seeing that the\nenemy were losing heart, again ordered the knights to mount, and these\ndashing among the enemy, completed their defeat.\n\nWhile this had been going on, news came to the king that the Saracens\nfrom another side had made their way into Jaffa, and were massacring the\nChristians. Without an instant's delay he flew to their succour, followed\nonly by two knights and a few archers, the rest being so worn by their\nexertions as to be unable to move. The Mamelukes, the chosen guard of\nSaladin, had headed the attack; but even these were driven out from the\ntown, and Richard dashed out from the city in their pursuit. One Saracen\nemir, distinguished for his stature and strength, ventured to match\nhimself against the king, and rode boldly at him. But with one blow\nRichard severed his head, and his right shoulder and arm, from his body.\nThen having, by his single arm, put to rout the Saracens at this point,\nhe dashed through them to the aid of the little band of knights who had\nremained on the defensive when he left them at the alarm of the city\nbeing entered. These were almost sinking with fatigue and wounds; but\nKing Richard opened a way around them by slaying numbers of the enemy,\nand then charged again alone into the midst of the Mussulman host, and\nwas lost to the sight of his companions. All thought that they would\nnever see him again. But he soon reappeared, his horse covered with\nblood, but himself unwounded; and the attack of the enemy ceased.\n\nFrom the hour of daybreak, it is said, Richard had not ceased for a\nmoment to deal out his blows, and the skin of his hand adhered to the\nhandle of his battle-axe. This narration would appear almost fabulous,\nwere it not that it is attested in the chronicles of several\neye-witnesses, and for centuries afterwards the Saracen women hushed\ntheir babes when fractious by threatening them with Malek-Rik, the name\nwhich they gave to King Richard.\n\nGlorious as was the success, it was a sad one, for several of the most\ndevoted of the followers of King Richard were wounded badly, some few to\ndeath. Among these last, to the terrible grief of Cuthbert, was his\nfriend and patron, the Earl of Evesham. The king, on taking off his\narmour, hurried to his tent.\n\n\"The glory of this day is marred indeed,\" he said to the wounded knight,\n\"if I am to lose you, Sir Walter.\"\n\n\"I fear that it must even be so, my lord,\" the dying earl said. \"I am\nglad that I have seen this day, for never did I think to witness such\nfeats as those which your Majesty has performed; and though the crusade\nhas failed, and the Holy City remains in the hands of the infidel, yet\nassuredly no shadow of disgrace has fallen upon the English arms, and,\nindeed, great glory has accrued to us. Whatever may be said of the Great\nCrusade, it will, at least, be allowed by all men, and for all time, that\nhad the princes and soldiers of other nations done as your Majesty and\nyour followers have done, the holy city would have fallen into our hands\nwithin a month of our putting foot upon the soil. Your Majesty, I have a\nboon to ask.\"\n\n\"You have but to name it, Sir Walter, and it is yours.\"\n\n\"Sir Cuthbert, here,\" he said, pointing to the young knight, who was\nsorrowfully kneeling by his bedside, \"is as a son to me. The relationship\nby blood is but slight, but by affection it is as close as though he were\nmine own. I have, as your Majesty knows, no male heirs, and my daughter\nis but young, and will now be a royal ward. I beseech your Majesty to\nbestow her in marriage, when the time comes, upon Sir Cuthbert. They have\nknown each other as children, and the union will bring happiness,\nmethinks, to both, as well as strength and protection to her; and\nfurther, if it might be, I would fain that you should bestow upon him my\ntitle and dignity.\"\n\n\"It shall be so,\" the king said. \"When your eyes are closed, Sir Walter,\nSir Cuthbert shall be Earl of Evesham, and, when the time comes, the\nhusband of your daughter.\"\n\nCuthbert was too overwhelmed with grief to feel a shadow of exaltation at\nthe gracious intimation of the king; although, even then, a thought of\nfuture happiness in the care of the fair young lady Margaret passed\nbefore his mind. For the last time the king gave his hand to his faithful\nservant, who pressed it to his lips, and a few minutes afterwards\nbreathed his last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. AN ALPINE STORM.\n\n\nThe tremendous exertions which King Richard had made told upon him, and\nattacks of fever succeeded each other at short intervals. This, however,\nmattered the less, since negotiations were now proceeding between him and\nSaladin. It was impossible, with the slight means at his disposal, for\nRichard further to carry on the crusade alone. Moreover, pressing news\nhad arrived from his mother in England, urging him to return, as his\nbrother John was intriguing against him, and had already assumed all but\nthe kingly tide. Saladin was equally desirous of peace. His wild troops\nwere, for the most part, eager to return to their homes, and the defeats\nwhich they had suffered, and the, to them, miraculous power of King\nRichard's arm, had lowered their spirit and made them eager to be away.\nTherefore he consented without difficulty to the terms proposed. By\nthese, the Christians were to surrender Ascalon, but were to keep Jaffa,\nTyre, and the fortresses along the coast. All hostilities were to be\nsuspended on both sides for the space of three years, three months, three\nweeks, three days, and three hours, when Richard hoped to return again\nand to recommence the struggle.\n\nBetween the sultan and King Richard a feeling approaching that of\nfriendship had sprung up during the campaign. Saladin was himself brave\nin the extreme, and exposed his life as fearlessly as did his Christian\nrival, and the two valiant leaders recognized the great qualities of each\nother. Several times during the campaign, when Richard had been ill, the\nemir had sent him presents of fruit and other matters, to which Richard\nhad responded in the same spirit. An interview had taken place between\nthem which further cemented their friendship; and when Richard promised\nto return again at the end of the truce with a far larger army, and to\naccomplish the rescue of the holy city, the sultan smiled, and said that\nit appeared that valour alone was not sufficient to conquer in the Holy\nLand, but that if Jerusalem were to fall into the hands of the\nChristians, it could fall into no worthier hands than those of Malek-Rik.\n\nSo, with many mutual courtesies, the great rivals separated, and, soon\nafter, King Richard and the little remnant of his army embarked on board\nship, and set sail for England.\n\nIt was on the 11th of October, 1192, that Richard Coeur de Lion left\nPalestine. Soon after they started, a storm suddenly burst upon them,\nand dispersed them in various directions. The ship in which Queen\nBerengaria was carried, arrived safely in Sicily; but that in which King\nRichard was borne was missing, and none of his fellow-voyagers knew what\nhad become of him.\n\nSir Cuthbert was in the same vessel as the king, and the bark was driven\nupon the Island of Corfu. All reached shore in safety, and King Richard\nthen hired three small vessels, in which he sailed to the port of Zara,\nwhence he hoped to reach the domains of his nephew, Otho of Saxony, the\nson of his sister Matilda. The king had with him now but two of his\nknights, Baldwin of Bthune, and Cuthbert of Evesham. Cnut was with his\nfeudal chief--for such Cuthbert had now, by his accession to the rank of\nEarl of Evesham, become--and three or four English archers.\n\n\"I fear, my lords,\" the king said to his knights as he sat in a little\nroom in an inn at Zara, \"that my plight is a bad one. I am surrounded by\nenemies, and, alas! I can no longer mount my steed and ride out as at\nJaffa to do battle with them. My brother, John Lackland, is scheming to\ntake my place upon the throne of England. Philip of France, whose mind is\nfar better at such matters than at setting armies in the field, is in\nleague with him. The Emperor Henry has laid claim to the throne of\nSicily. Leopold of Austria has not forgiven me the blow I struck him in\nthe face at Ascalon, and the friends of Conrad of Montferat are spreading\nfar and wide the lie that I was the instigator of his murder. Sure never\nhad a poor king so many enemies, and few have ever had so small a\nfollowing as I have now. What think you, my lords? What course would you\nadvise that I should adopt? If I can reach Saxony, doubtless Otho will\naid me. But hence to Dresden is a long journey indeed. I have neither\ncredit nor funds to hire a ship to take us by sea. Nor would such a\nvoyage be a safe one, when so many of my enemies' ships are on the main.\nI must needs, I think, go in disguise, for my way lies wholly through the\ncountry of my enemies.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" Cuthbert said, \"no potentate could for very shame venture to\ndetain your Majesty on your way from the Holy Land, where you have\nwrought such great deeds. Were I in your place, I would at once proclaim\nmyself, mount my horse, have my banner carried before me, and ride openly\non. You have, too, another claim, namely, that of being shipwrecked, and\neven in war-time nations respect those whom the force of God has thrown\nupon their shores.\"\n\n\"I fear me, Sir Cuthbert,\" Sir Baldwin said, \"that you overrate the\nchivalry of our master's enemies. Had we been thrown on the shores of\nFrance, Philip perhaps would hesitate to lay hands upon the king; but\nthese petty German princelings have no idea of the observances of true\nchivalry. They are coarse and brutal in their ways; and though in outward\nform following the usages of knighthood, they have never been penetrated\nwith its spirit. If the friends of Conrad of Montferat lay hands upon\nKing Richard, I fear that no scruples will prevent them from using their\nadvantage to the utmost. Even their emperor I would not trust. The course\nwhich you advise would no doubt be in accordance with the spirit of King\nRichard; but it would be madness for him to judge other people's spirit\nby his own, and it would be rushing into the lion's den to proclaim\nhimself here. I should recommend, if I might venture to do so, that his\nMajesty should assume a false name, and that we should travel in small\nparties so as to attract no attention, each making his way to Saxony as\nbest he may.\"\n\nThere was silence for a minute or two, and then the king with a\nsigh, said,--\n\n\"I fear that you are right, Sir Baldwin, and that there is no chivalry\namong these swinish German lords. You shall accompany me. Not, Sir\nCuthbert,\" he observed kindly, noticing a look of disappointment upon the\nface of the young knight, \"that I estimate your fidelity one whit lower\nthan that of my brave friend; but he is the elder and the more versed in\nEuropean travel, and may manage to bring matters through better than you\nwould do. You will have dangers enough to encounter yourself, more even\nthan I shall, for your brave follower, Cnut, can speak no language but\nhis own, and your archers will be hard to pass as any other than what\nthey are. You must be my messenger to England, should you arrive there\nwithout me. Tell my mother and wife where you left me, and that, if I do\nnot come home I have fallen into the hands of one or other of my bitter\nfoes. Bid them bestir themselves to hold England for me against my\nbrother John, and, if needs be, to move the sovereigns of Europe to free\nme from the hands of my enemies. Should a ransom be needed, I think that\nmy people of England will not grudge their goods for their king.\"\n\nThe following day the king bade farewell to his faithful followers,\ngiving his hand to kiss, not only to Sir Cuthbert, but to Cnut and\nhis archers.\n\n\"You have done me brave service,\" he said, \"and I trust may yet have\noccasion to do it again. These are bad times when Richard of England has\nnought wherewith to reward his friends. But,\" he said, taking a gold\nchain from his neck and breaking it with his strong fingers into five\nfragments, \"that is for you, Cnut, and for your four archers, in\nremembrance of King Richard.\"\n\nThe men, albeit hardened by many scenes of warfare, yet shed tears\nplenteously at parting with the king.\n\n\"We had better,\" Cuthbert said to them when they were alone, \"delay here\nfor a few days. If we are taken, the news that some Englishmen have been\ncaptured making their way north from Zara will spread rapidly, and may\ncause the enemies of Richard to be on the look-out for him, suspecting\nthat the ship which bore us may also have carried him; for the news that\nhe is missing will spread rapidly through Europe, and will set all his\nenemies on the alert.\"\n\nIn accordance with this plan, they delayed for another ten days at Zara,\nand then, hiring a small boat, were landed some thirty miles further\nalong the coast. Cuthbert had obtained for Cnut the dress of a palmer, as\nin this he would pass almost unquestioned, and his silence might be\naccounted for on the ground that he had taken a vow of silence. He\nhimself had placed on his coat and armour a red cross, instead of the\nwhite cross borne by the English knights, and would now pass as a French\nknight. Similar changes were made in the dress of his followers, and he\ndetermined to pass as a French noble who had been wrecked on his way\nhome, and who was returning through Germany to France. The difficulties\nin his own case would not be serious, as his French would pass muster\nanywhere in Germany. The greatest difficulty would be with his\nattendants; but he saw no way of avoiding this.\n\nCuthbert's object, when with his little party he separated from King\nRichard, was to make his way to Verona, thence cross by Trent into\nBavaria, and so to journey to Saxony. Fortunately he had, at the storming\nof Acre, become possessed of a valuable jewel, and this he now sold, and\npurchased a charger for himself. He had little fear of any trouble in\npassing through the north of Italy, for this was neutral ground, where\nknights of all nations met, and where, neither as an English nor a French\ncrusader would he attract either comment or attention.\n\nIt was a slow journey across the northern plains, as of course he had to\naccommodate his pace to that of his men. Cnut and the archers had\ngrumbled much at the change in the colour of the cross upon their\njerkins; and, as Cnut said, would have been willing to run greater perils\nunder their true colours than to affect to belong to any other\nnationality. On their way they passed through Padua, and there stopped a\nfew days. Cuthbert could but feel, in looking at the splendour of this\nItalian city, the courteous manner of its people, and the university\nwhich was even then famous, how far in advance were those stately cities\nof Italy to Western Europe. His followers were as much surprised as\nhimself at the splendour of the city. Here they experienced no trouble or\nannoyance whatever, for to the cities of Italy knights of all nations\nresorted, learned men came to study, philosophers to dispute, and as\nthese brought their attendants with them, you might in the streets of\nPadua and its sister cities hear every language in Europe spoken.\n\nFrom Padua they journeyed to Verona, marvelling greatly at the richness\nof the country. The footmen, however, grumbled at the flatness of the\nplain, and said that it was as bad as marching in the Holy Land. On\ntheir right, however, the slopes of the Alps, thickly clad with forests,\nreached down nearly to the road, and Cuthbert assured them that they\nwould have plenty of climbing before they had done. At Verona they\ntarried again, and wondered much at the great amphitheatre, then almost\nperfect. Cuthbert related to Cnut and the archers, how men had there\nbeen set to fight, while the great stone benches round were thronged\nwith men and women looking on at their death struggles, and said that\nnot unfrequently British captives were brought hither and made to\ncontend in the arena. The honest fellows were full of indignation and\nhorror at the thought of men killing themselves to give sport to others.\nThey were used to hard knocks, and thought but little of their life, and\nwould have betaken themselves to their bows and bills without hesitation\nin case of a quarrel. But to fight in cold blood for amusement seemed to\nthem very terrible.\n\nCuthbert would then have travelled on to Milan at that time next to Rome\nthe richest city in Europe, but he longed to be back in England, and was\nthe more anxious as he knew that King Richard would be passing through\ngreat dangers, and he hoped to meet him at the Court of Saxony. His\nmoney, too, was fast running out, and he found that it would be beyond\nhis slender means to extend his journey so far. At Verona, then, they\nturned their back on the broad plains of Lombardy, and entered the valley\nof the Trent.\n\nSo far no observation whatever had been excited by the passage of the\nEnglish knight. So many crusaders were upon their way home, many in\ngrievous plight, that the somewhat shabby retinue passed unnoticed. But\nthey were now leaving Italy, and entering a country where German was\nspoken. Trent, in those days an important city, was then, and is still,\nthe meeting place of Italy and Germany. Both tongues are here spoken; but\nwhile the Italian perhaps preponderates, the customs, manners, and mode\nof thought of the people belong to those of the mountaineers of the\nTyrol, rather than of the dwellers on the plains.\n\n\"You are choosing a stormy time,\" the landlord of the hostelry where they\nput up said to Cuthbert. \"The winter is now at hand, and storms sweep\nacross the passes with terrible violence. You had better, at the last\nvillage you come to in the valley, obtain the services of a guide, for\nshould a snowstorm come on when you are crossing, the path will be lost,\nand nothing will remain but a miserable death. By daylight the road is\ngood. It has been cut with much trouble, and loaded mules can pass over\nwithout difficulty. Poles have been erected at short distances to mark\nthe way when the snow covers it. But when the snowstorms sweep across the\nmountains, it is impossible to see ten paces before you, and if the\ntraveller leaves the path he is lost.\"\n\n\"But I suppose,\" Cuthbert said, \"that even in winter travellers\npass over?\"\n\n\"They do,\" the host said. \"The road is as open in winter as in summer,\nalthough, of course, the dangers are greater. Still, there is nothing to\nprevent vigorous men from crossing over when the storms come on. Now,\ntoo, with the snow already lying in the upper forests, the wolves are\nabroad, and should you be attacked by one of those herds, you will find\nit hard work to defend your lives. Much has been done to render the road\nsafe. At the distance of every league stone houses have been erected,\nwhere travellers can find shelter either from the storm or from the\nattacks of wolves or bears, for these, too, abound in the forests, and in\nsummer there is fine hunting among them. You are, as I see, returning\nfrom the Holy Land, and are therefore used to heat rather than cold, so I\nshould advise you before you leave this city to buy some rough cloaks to\nshield you from the cold. You can obtain them for your followers very\ncheaply, made of the mountain goat or of sheepskins, and even those of\nbearskin well dressed are by no means dear.\"\n\nObtaining the address of a merchant who kept these things, Cuthbert\nproceeded thither; and purchased five cloaks of goat-skin with hoods to\npull over their heads for his followers, while for himself he obtained\none of rather finer material.\n\nAnother two days' journey brought them to the foot of the steep ascent,\nand here they hired the services of a guide. The ascent was long and\ndifficult, and in spite of the praises which the host had bestowed upon\nthe road, it was so steep that Cuthbert was, for the most part, obliged\nto walk, leading his steed, whose feet slipped on the smooth rock, and as\nin many places a false step would have thrown them down many hundreds of\nfeet into the valley below, Cuthbert judged it safer to trust himself to\nhis own feet. He disencumbered himself of his helmet and gorget, and\nplaced these upon the horse's back. At nightfall they had attained a very\nconsiderable height, and stopped at one of the small refuges of which the\nlandlord had spoken.\n\n\"I like not the look of the weather,\" the guide said in the morning--at\nleast that was what Cuthbert judged him to say, for he could speak no\nword of the man's language. His actions, however, as he looked towards\nthe sky, and shook his head, spoke for themselves, and Cuthbert, feeling\nhis own powerlessness in a situation so novel to him, felt serious\nmisgivings at the prospect.\n\nThe scenery was now very wild. On all sides crags and mountain tops\ncovered with snow glistened in the sun. The woods near the path were free\nof snow; but higher up they rose black above the white ground. The wind\nblew keenly, and all rejoiced in the warm cloaks which they had obtained;\nfor even with the protection of these they had found the cold bitter\nduring the night.\n\n\"I like not this country,\" Cnut said. \"We grumbled at the heat of\nPalestine, but I had rather march across the sand there than in this\ninhospitable frozen region. The woods look as if they might contain\nspectres. There is a silence which seems to be unnatural, and my courage,\nlike the warmth of my body, is methinks oozing out from my fingers.\"\n\nCuthbert laughed.\n\n\"I have no doubt that your courage would come again much quicker than the\nwarmth, Cnut, if there were any occasion for it. A brisk walk will set\nyou all right again, and banish these uneasy fancies. To-night we shall\nbe at the highest point, and to-morrow begin to descend towards Germany.\"\n\nAll day the men kept steadily on. The guide from time to time looked\napprehensively at the sky; and although in the earlier part of the day\nCuthbert's inexperienced eye saw nothing to cause the slightest\nuneasiness, towards the afternoon the scene changed. Light clouds began\nto gather on the top of all the hills and to shut the mountain peaks\nentirely from view. The wind moaned between the gorges and occasionally\nswept along in such sudden gusts that they could with difficulty retain\ntheir feet. The sky became gradually overcast, and frequently light\nspecks of snow, so small as to be scarcely perceptible, were driven along\non the blast, making their faces smart by the force with which they\nstruck them.\n\n\"It scarcely needs our guide's face,\" Cuthbert said, \"to tell us that a\nstorm is at hand, and that our position is a dangerous one. As for me, I\nown that I feel better pleased now that the wind is blowing, and the\nsilence is broken, than at the dead stillness which prevailed this\nmorning. After all, methinks that a snowstorm cannot be more dreaded than\na sandstorm, and we have faced those before now.\"\n\nFaster and faster the snow came down, until at last the whole air seemed\nfull of it, and it was with difficulty that they could stagger forward.\nWhere the path led across open places the wind swept away the snow as\nfast as it fell, but in the hollows the track was already covered; and\nfeeling the difficulty of facing the blinding gale, Cuthbert now\nunderstood the urgency with which his host had insisted upon the danger\nof losing the track. Not a word was spoken among the party as they\nplodded along. The guide kept ahead, using the greatest caution wherever\nthe path was obliterated by the snow, sometimes even sounding with his\niron-shod staff to be sure that they were upon the level rock. In spite\nof his warm cloak Cuthbert felt that he was becoming chilled to the bone.\nHis horse could with difficulty keep his feet; and Cnut and the archers\nlagged behind.\n\n\"You must keep together, lads,\" he shouted. \"I have heard that in these\nmountains when sleepiness overpowers the traveller, death is at hand.\nTherefore, come what may, we must struggle on.\"\n\nMany times the gale was so violent that they were obliged to pause, and\ntake shelter under the side of a rock or precipice, until the fury of the\nblast had passed; and Cuthbert eagerly looked out for the next refuge. At\nlast they reached it, and the guide at once entered. It was not that in\nwhich he had intended to pass the night, for this lay still higher; but\nit would have been madness to attempt to go further in the face of such a\ngale. He signed to Cuthbert that it was necessary at once to collect\nfirewood, and he himself proceeded to light some brands which had been\nleft by previous travellers. Cuthbert gave directions to Cnut and the\narchers; and these, feeling that life depended upon a good fire being\nkept up, set to with a will, cutting down shrubs and branches growing in\nthe vicinity of the hut. In half an hour a huge fire blazed in the\nrefuge; and as the warmth thawed their limbs, their tongues were\nunloosened, and a feeling of comfort again prevailed.\n\n\"If this be mountaineering, my lord,\" Cnut said, \"I trust that never\nagain may it be my fortune to venture among the hills. How long, I\nwonder, do the storms last here? I was grumbling all the way up the hill\nat the load of provisions which the guide insisted that each of us should\nbring with him. As it was to be but a three days' journey before we\nreached a village on the other side, I wondered why he insisted upon our\ntaking food enough to last us at least for a week. But I understand now,\nand thank him for his foresight; for if this storm goes on, we are\nassuredly prisoners here for so long as it may continue.\"\n\nThe horse had to be brought into the hut, for it would have been death\nfor it to have remained outside.\n\n\"What is that?\" Cnut said presently, as a distant howl was heard between\nthe lulls of the storm. The guide muttered some word, which Cuthbert did\nnot understand. But he said to Cnut, \"I doubt not that it is wolves.\nThank God that we are safe within this refuge, for here not even the most\nravenous beasts could make their way.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" Cnut said contemptuously. \"Wolves are no bigger than dogs. I have\nheard my grandfather say that he shot one in the forest, and that it was\nno bigger than a hound. We should make short work of them.\"\n\n\"I know not,\" Cuthbert said. \"I have heard tales of these animals which\nshow that they must be formidable opponents. They hunt in great packs,\nand are so furious that they will attack parties of travellers; many of\nthese have perished miserably, horses and men, and nothing but their\nswords and portions of their saddles have remained to tell where the\nbattle was fought.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. SENTENCED TO DEATH.\n\n\nJust before arriving at the refuge, they had passed along a very steep\nand dangerous path. On one side the rock rose precipitously, ten feet\nabove their heads. On the other, was a fall into the valley below. The\nroad at this point was far wider than usual.\n\nPresently, the howl of a wolf was heard near, and soon the solitary call\nwas succeeded by the howling of great numbers of animals. These speedily\nsurrounded the hut, and so fierce were their cries, that Cnut changed his\nopinion as to the ease with which they could be defeated, and allowed\nthat he would rather face an army of Saracens than a troop of these\nill-conditioned animals. The horse trembled in every limb at the sound of\nthe howling of the wolves; and cold as was the night, in spite of the\ngreat fire that blazed on the hearth, his coat became covered with the\nlather of fear. Even upon the roof above the trampling of the animals\ncould be heard; and through the open slits of the windows which some\ntravellers before them had stuffed with straw, they could hear the fierce\nbreathing and snorting of the savage beasts, who scratched and tore to\nmake an entrance.\n\n\"Methinks,\" Cuthbert said, \"that we might launch a few arrows through\nthese loopholes. The roof appears not to be over strong; and should some\nof them force an entrance, the whole pack might follow.\"\n\nDark as was the night, the black bodies were visible against the white\nsnow, and the archers shot several arrows forth, each stretching a wolf\ndead on the ground. Those killed were at once pounced upon by their\ncomrades, and torn to pieces; and this mark of savageness added to the\nhorror which those within felt of the ferocious animals. Suddenly there\nwas a pause in the howling around the hut, and then Cnut, looking forth\nfrom the loophole, declared that the whole body had gone off at full\nspeed along the path by which they had reached the refuge. Almost\nimmediately afterwards a loud shout for help was heard, followed by the\nrenewed howling and yelping of the wolves.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" Cuthbert exclaimed. \"Some traveller coming after us is\nattacked by these horrible beasts. Let us sally out, Cnut. We cannot hear\na Christian torn to pieces by these beasts, without lending him a hand.\"\n\nIn spite of the angry shouts and entreaties of the guide, the door thrust\nopen, and the party, armed with their axes and bows, at once rushed out\ninto the night. The storm had for the moment abated and they had no\ndifficulty in making their way along the track. In fifty yards they came\nto a bend of the path, and saw, a little distance before them, a black\nmass of animals, covering the road, and congregated round a figure who\nstood with his back to the rock. With a shout of encouragement they\nsprang forward, and in a few moments were in the midst of the savage\nanimals, who turned their rage against them at once. They had fired two\nor three arrows apiece, as they approached, into them; and now, throwing\ndown their bows, the archers betook themselves to their swords, while\nCuthbert with his heavy battle-axe hewed and cut at the wolves as they\nsprang towards him. In a minute they had cleared their way to the figure,\nwhich was that of a knight in complete armour. He leant against the rock\ncompletely exhausted, and could only mutter a word of thanks through his\nclosed visor. At a short distance off a number of the wolves were\ngathered, rending and tearing the horse of the knight; but the rest soon\nrecovering from their surprise, attacked with fury the little party. The\nthick cloaks of the archers stood them in good stead against the animals'\nteeth, and standing in a group with their backs to the rock, they hewed\nand cut vigorously at their assailants. The numbers of these, however,\nappeared almost innumerable, and fresh stragglers continued to come along\nthe road, and swell their body. As fast as those in front fell, their\nheads cleft with the axes of the party, fresh ones sprang forward; and\nCuthbert saw that in spite of the valour and strength of his men, the\nsituation was well nigh desperate. He himself had been saved from injury\nby his harness, for he still had on his greaves and leg pieces.\n\n\"Keep together,\" he shouted to his men, \"and each lend aid to the other\nif he sees him pulled down. Strike lustily for life, and hurry not your\nblows, but let each tell.\" This latter order he gave perceiving that some\nof the archers, terrified by this furious army of assailants with gaping\nmouths and glistening teeth, were striking wildly, and losing their\npresence of mind.\n\nThe combat, although it might have been prolonged, could yet have had\nbut one termination, and the whole party would have fallen. At this\nmoment, however, a gust-of wind, more furious than any which they had\nbefore experienced, swept along the gorge, and the very wolves had to\ncrouch on their stomachs to prevent themselves being hurled by its fury\ninto the ravine below. Then even above the storm a deep roar was heard.\nIt grew louder and louder. The wolves, as if struck with terror, leaped\nto their feet, and scattered on either way along the path at full speed.\n\n\"What sound can this be?\" Cnut exclaimed in an awestruck voice. \"It\nsounds like thunder; but it is regular and unbroken; and, my lord, surely\nthe earth quakes under our feet!\"\n\nLouder and louder grew the roar.\n\n\"Throw yourselves down against the wall of rock,\" Cuthbert shouted,\nhimself setting the example.\n\nA moment afterwards, from above, a mighty mass of rock and snow poured\nover like a cascade, with a roar and sound which nigh stunned them. For\nminutes--it seemed for hours to them--the deluge of snow and rock\ncontinued. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it ceased, and a silence as\nof death reigned over the place.\n\n\"Arise,\" Cuthbert said; \"the danger, methinks, is past. It was what men\ncall an avalanche--a torrent of snow slipping down from the higher peaks.\nWe have had a narrow escape indeed.\"\n\nBy this time the knight whom they had rescued was able to speak, and\nraising his visor, he returned his deepest thanks to those who had come\nso opportunely to his aid.\n\n\"I was well nigh exhausted,\" he said, \"and it was only my armour which\nsaved me from being torn to pieces. A score of them had hold of me; but,\nfortunately, my mail was of Milan proof, and even the jaws and teeth of\nthese enormous beasts were unable to pierce it.\"\n\n\"The refuge is near at hand,\" Cuthbert said. \"It is but a few yards\nround yonder point. It is well that we heard your voice. I fear that your\nhorse has fallen a victim.\"\n\nAssisting the knight, who, in spite of his armour, was sorely bruised\nand exhausted, they made their way back to the refuge. Cnut and the\narchers were all bleeding freely from various wounds inflicted upon them\nin the struggle, breathless and exhausted from their exertions, and\nthoroughly awe-struck by the tremendous phenomenon of which they had\nbeen witnesses, and which they had only escaped from their good fortune\nin happening to be in a place so formed that the force of the avalanche\nhad swept over their heads The whole of the road, with the exception of\na narrow piece four feet in width, had been carried away. Looking\nupwards, they saw that the forest had been swept clear, not a tree\nremaining in a wide track as far as they could see up the hill. The\ngreat bowlders which had strewn the hill-side, and many of which were as\nlarge as houses, had been swept away like straws before the rush of\nsnow, and for a moment they feared that the refuge had also been\ncarried away. Turning the corner, however, they saw to their delight\nthat the limits of the avalanche had not extended so far, the refuges,\nas they afterwards learned, being so placed as to be sheltered by\noverhanging cliffs from any catastrophe of this kind.\n\nThey found the guide upon his knees, muttering his prayers before a\ncross, which he had formed of two sticks laid crosswise on the ground\nbefore him; and he could scarce believe his eyes when they entered, so\ncertain had he considered it that they were lost. There were no longer\nany signs of the wolves. The greater portion, indeed, of the pack had\nbeen overwhelmed by the avalanche, and the rest, frightened and scared,\nhad fled to their fastnesses in the woods.\n\nThe knight now removed his helmet, and discovered a handsome yoking man\nof some four-or-five-and-twenty years old.\n\n\"I am,\" he said, \"Baron Ernest of Kornstein. To whom do I owe my life?\"\n\n\"In spite of my red cross,\" Cuthbert said, \"I am English. My name is Sir\nCuthbert, and I am Earl of Evesham. I am on my return from the Holy Land\nwith my followers; and as we are passing through countries where many of\nthe people are hostile to England, we have thought it as well for a time\nto drop our nationality. But to you I do not hesitate to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"You do well,\" the young knight said, \"for, truth to say, the people of\nthese parts bear but little love to your countrymen. You have saved my\nlife when I was in the sorest danger. I had given myself up for lost, for\neven my armour could not have saved me long from these wretches; and my\nsword and life are at your disposal. You are young indeed,\" he said,\nlooking with surprise at Cuthbert, who had now thrown back the hood of\nhis cloak, \"to have gained the honour of knighthood. You scarce look\neighteen years of age, although, doubtless, you are older.\"\n\n\"I am scarce seventeen,\" Cuthbert said; \"but I have had the good fortune\nto attract the notice of King Richard, and to have received the\nknighthood from his sword.\"\n\n\"None more worthy,\" said the young knight, \"for although King Richard\nmay be fierce and proud, he is the worthiest knight in Christendom, and\nresembles the heroes of romance rather than a Christian king.\"\n\n\"He is my lord and master,\" Cuthbert said, \"and I love him beyond all\nmen, and would give my life for his. He is the kindest and best of\nmasters; and although it be true that he brooks no opposition, yet is it\nonly because his own bravery and eagerness render hateful to him the\nindolence and cowardice of others.\"\n\nThey now took their seats round the fire. The archers, by the advice of\nthe guide, rubbed their wounds with snow, and then applied bandages to\nthem. The wallets were opened, and a hearty supper eaten; and all,\nwrapping themselves in their fur cloaks, were soon asleep.\n\nFor four days the gale continued, keeping the party prisoners in the hut.\nOn the fifth, the force of the wind abated, and the snow ceased to fall.\nThey were forced to take the door off its hinges to open it, for the snow\nhad piled up so high that the chimney alone of the hut remained above its\nsurface. With great difficulty and labour they cleared a way out, and\nthen the guide again placing himself at their head, they proceeded on\ntheir way. The air was still and cold, and the sky of a deep, dark blue,\nwhich seemed even darker in contrast with the whiteness of the snow. At\ntimes they had great difficulty in struggling through the deep drifts;\nbut for the most part the wind had swept the path clear. Where it was\ndeepest, the tops of the posts still showed above the snow, and enabled\nthe guide to direct their footsteps. They were, however, obliged to\ntravel slowly, and it was three days before they gained the village on\nthe northern slope of the mountains, having slept at refuges by the road.\n\n\"What are your plans?\" the knight asked Sir Cuthbert that night, as they\nsat by the fire of the hostelry. \"I would warn you that the town which\nyou will first arrive at is specially hostile to your people, for the\nbaron, its master, is a relation of Conrad of Montferat, who is said to\nhave been killed by order of your king.\"\n\n\"It is false,\" Cuthbert said. \"King Richard had appointed him King of\nJerusalem; and, though he liked him not, thought him the fittest of those\nthere to exercise sovereignty. He was the last man who would have had an\nenemy assassinated; for so open is he of disposition, that he would have\nfought hand to hand with the meanest soldier of his army, had he desired\nto kill him.\"\n\n\"I doubt not that it is so, since you tell me,\" the knight said\ncourteously. \"But the people here have taken that idea into their minds,\nand it will be hard to disabuse them. You must therefore keep up your\ndisguise as a French knight while passing through this neighbourhood.\nAnother week's journeying, and you will reach the confines of Saxony, and\nthere you will, as you anticipate, be safe. But I would not answer for\nyour life were you discovered here to be of English birth. And now tell\nme if there is aught that I can do for you. I will myself accompany you\ninto the town, and will introduce you as a French knight, so that no\nsuspicion is likely to lie upon you, and will, further, ride with you to\nthe borders of Saxony. I am well known, and trust that my company will\navert all suspicion from you. You have told me that your purse is\nill-supplied; you must suffer me to replenish it. One knight need not\nfear to borrow of another; and I know that when you have returned to your\nhome, you will bestow the sum which I now give you upon some holy shrine\nin my name, and thus settle matters between us.\"\n\nCuthbert without hesitation accepted the offer, and was well pleased at\nfinding his purse replenished, for its emptiness had caused him serious\ntrouble. Cuthbert's steed was led by one of the archers, and he himself\nwalked gaily alongside of Sir Ernest, followed by his retainers. Another\nlong day's march brought them down to Innsbruck, where they remained\nquietly for a week. Then they journeyed on until they emerged from the\nmountains, crossed the Bavarian frontier, and arrived at Fussen, a strong\ncity, with well-built walls and defences.\n\nThey at once proceeded to the principal hostelry, where the young baron\nwas well known, and where great interest was excited by the news of the\nnarrow escape which he had had from the attack of the wolves. A journey\nacross the Alps was in those days regarded as a very perilous enterprise\nin the winter season, and the fact that he should have been rescued from\nsuch a strait appeared almost miraculous. They stayed for two days\nquietly in the city, Cuthbert declining the invitation of the young\nnoble to accompany him to the houses of his friends, as he did not wish\nthat any suspicion should be excited as to his nationality, and\npreferred remaining quiet to having forced upon him the necessity of\nmaking false statements. As to his followers, there was no fear of the\npeople among whom they mixed detecting that they were English. To the\nBavarian inhabitants, all languages, save their native German, were\nalike unintelligible; and even had French been commonly spoken, the\ndialects of that tongue, such as would naturally be spoken by archers\nand men-at-arms, would have been as Greek to those accustomed only to\nNorman French.\n\nUpon the third day, however, an incident occurred which upset Cuthbert's\ncalculations, and nearly involved the whole party in ruin. The town was,\nas the young baron had said, governed by a noble who was a near relation\nof Conrad of Montferat, and who was the bitter enemy of the English. A\ngreat fete had been given in honour of the marriage of his daughter, and\nupon this day the young pair were to ride in triumph through the city.\nGreat preparations had been made; masques and pageants of various kinds\nmanufactured; and the whole townspeople, dressed in their holiday attire,\nwere gathered in the streets. Cuthbert had gone out, followed by his\nlittle band of retainers, and taken their station to see the passing\nshow. First came a large body of knights and men-at-arms, with gay\nbanners and trappings. Then rode the bridegroom, with the bride carried\nin a litter by his side. After this came several allegorical\nrepresentations. Among these was the figure of a knight bearing the arms\nof Austria. Underneath his feet, on the car, lay a figure clad in a royal\nrobe, across whom was thrown a banner with the leopards of England. The\nknight stood with his foot on this figure.\n\nThis representation of the dishonour of England at the hands of Austria\nelicited great acclamations from the crowd. Cuthbert clenched his teeth\nand grasped his sword angrily, but had the sense to see the folly of\ntaking any notice of the insult. Not so with Cnut. Furious at the insult\noffered to the standard of his royal master, Cnut, with a bound, burst\nthrough the ranks of the crowd, leaped on to the car, and with a buffet\nsmote the figure representing Austria, into the road, and lifted the flag\nof England from the ground. A yell of indignation and rage was heard. The\ninfuriated crowd rushed forward. Cnut, with a bound, sprang from the car,\nand, joining his comrades, burst through those who attempted to impede\nthem, and darted down a by-street.\n\nCuthbert, for the moment amazed at the action of his follower, had on the\ninstant drawn his sword and joined the archers. In the crowd, however, he\nwas for a second separated from them; and before he could tear himself\nfrom the hands of the citizens who had seized him, the men-at-arms\naccompanying the procession surrounded him, and he was led away by them\nto the castle, the guards with difficulty protecting him from the enraged\npopulace. Even at this moment Cuthbert experienced a deep sense of\nsatisfaction at the thought that his followers had escaped. But he feared\nthat alone, and unacquainted with the language of the country, they would\nfind it difficult indeed to escape the search which would be made for\nthem, and to manage to find their way back to their country. For himself,\nhe had little hopes of liberty, and scarcely more of life. The hatred of\nthe baron towards the English would now be heightened by the daring act\nof insult to the arms of Austria, and this would give a pretext for any\ndeed of violence which might be wrought.\n\nCuthbert was, after a short confinement, brought before the lord baron of\nthe place, in the great hall of the castle.\n\n\"Who art thou, sir,\" the noble exclaimed, \"who darest to disturb the\nmarriage procession of my daughter, and to insult the standard of the\nemperor my master?\"\n\n\"I am Sir Cuthbert, Earl of Evesham, a baron of England,\" Cuthbert said\nfearlessly, \"and am travelling homeward from the Holy Land. My garb as a\ncrusader should protect me from all interruption; and the heedless\nconduct of my retainer was amply justified by the insult offered to the\narms of England. There is not one of the knights assembled round you who\nwould not in like manner have avenged an insult offered to those of\nAustria; and I am ready to do battle in the lists with any who choose to\nsay that the deed was a foul or improper one. In the Holy Land, Austrians\nand English fought side by side; and it is strange indeed to me that on\nmy return, journeying through the country of the emperor, I should find\nmyself treated as an enemy, and see the arms of King Richard exposed to\ninsult and derision by the burghers of this city.\"\n\nAs Cuthbert had spoken, he threw down his mailed glove, and several of\nthe knights present stepped forward to pick it up. The baron, however,\nwaved them back.\n\n\"It is no question,\" he said, \"of honourable fight. This is a follower of\nthe murderer of my good cousin of Montferat, who died under the hands of\nassassins set upon him by Richard of England.\"\n\n\"It is false!\" Cuthbert shouted. \"I denounce it as a foul lie, and will\nmaintain it with my life.\"\n\n\"Your life is already forfeited,\" the baron said, \"both by your past\nconnexion with Richard of England and as the insulter of the arms of\nAustria. You die, and to-morrow at noon your head shall be struck off in\nthe great square before my castle.\"\n\nWithout another word Cuthbert was hurried off to his cell, and there\nremained, thinking moodily over the events of the day, until nightfall.\nHe had no doubt that his sentence would be carried out, and his anxiety\nwas rather for his followers than for himself. He feared that they would\nmake some effort on his behalf, and would sacrifice their own lives in\ndoing so, without the possibility of assisting him.\n\nThe next morning he was led out to the square before the castle. It was a\nlarge flagged courtyard. Upon one side was the entrance to the castle,\none of whose wings also formed a second side to the square. The side\nfacing this was formed by the wall of the city, and the fourth opened\nupon a street of the town. This side of the square was densely filled\nwith citizens, while the men-at-arms of the baron and a large number of\nknights were gathered behind a scaffold erected in the centre. Upon this\nwas a block, and by the side stood a headsman. As Cuthbert was led\nforward a thrill of pleasure ran through him at perceiving no signs of\nhis followers, who he greatly feared might have been captured in the\nnight, and brought there to share his fate.\n\nAs he was led forward, the young noble whose life he had saved advanced\nto the baron, and dropping on one knee before him, craved the life of\nCuthbert, relating the event by which he had saved his life in the\npassage of the mountains. The baron frowned heavily.\n\n\"Though he had saved the life of every noble in Bavaria,\" he said, \"he\nshould die. I have sworn an oath that every Englishman who fell into my\nhands should expiate the murder of my kinsman; and this fellow is,\nmoreover, guilty of an outrage to the arms of Austria.\"\n\nThe young Sir Ernest drew himself up haughtily.\n\n\"My lord baron,\" he said, \"henceforth I renounce all allegiance to you,\nand I will lay the case before the emperor, our common master, and will\ncry before him at the outrage which has thus been passed upon a noble\ngentleman. He has thrown down the glove, and challenged any of your\nknights, and I myself am equally ready to do battle in his cause.\"\n\nThe baron grew red with passion, and he would have ordered the instant\narrest of the young man, but as Sir Ernest was connected by blood with\nmany present, and was indeed one of the most popular among the nobles of\nthe province, the baron simply waved him aside, and ordered Cuthbert to\nbe led to the block. The young Englishman was by the executioner divested\nof his armour and helmet, and stood in the simple attire worn by men of\nrank at that time. He looked around, and holding up his hand, conveying\nalike a farewell and a command to his followers to remain in concealment,\nhe gazed round the crowd, thinking that he might see among them in some\ndisguise or other the features of Cnut, whose tall figure would have\nrendered him conspicuous in a crowd. He failed, however, to see any signs\nof him, and turning to the executioner, signified by a gesture that he\nwas ready.\n\nAt this instant an arrow from the wall above pierced the brain of the\nman, and he fell dead in his tracks. A roar of astonishment burst from\nthe crowd. Upon the city wall at this point was a small turret, and on\nthis were five figures. The wall around was deserted, and for the moment\nthese men were masters of the position.\n\n\"Seize those insolent varlets!\" the baron shouted, shaking his sword with\na gesture of fury at them.\n\nHis words, however, were arrested, for at the moment another arrow struck\nhim in the throat, and he fell back into the arms of those around him.\n\nQuickly now the arrows of the English archers flew into the courtyard.\nThe confusion which reigned there was indescribable. The citizens with\nshouts of alarm took to their heels. The men-at-arms were powerless\nagainst this rain of missiles, and the knights, hastily closing their\nvisors, shouted contradictory orders, which no one obeyed.\n\nIn the confusion no one noticed the prisoner. Seizing a moment when the\nattention of all was fixed upon the wall, he leaped from the platform,\nand making his way unnoticed through the excited crowd of men-at-arms,\ndarted down a narrow lane that divided the castle from the wall. He ran\nalong until, 100 yards farther, he came to a staircase by which access to\nthe battlements was obtained. Running lightly up this, he kept along the\nwall until he reached the turret.\n\n\"Thanks, my noble Cnut!\" he exclaimed, \"and you, my brave fellows. But I\nfear you have forfeited your lives. There is no escape. In a minute the\nwhole force of the place will recover from their confusion, and be down\nupon us from both sides.\"\n\n\"We have prepared for that,\" Cnut said. \"Here is a rope hanging down into\nthe moat.\"\n\nGlancing over, Cuthbert saw that the moat was dry; and after a final\ndischarge of arrows into the crowd, the six men slid one after another\ndown the rope and made their way at full speed across the country.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. DRESDEN.\n\n\nIt was some ten minutes before the men-at-arms rallied sufficiently from\ntheir surprise to obey orders. Two bodies were then drawn up, and\nproceeded at a rapid pace towards the staircases leading to the wall, one\non each side of the turret in which they believed that the little body of\naudacious assailants were still lying. Having reached the wall, the\nsoldiers advanced, covering themselves with their shields, for they had\nlearnt the force with which an English clothyard shaft drawn by a strong\nhand flies. Many had been killed by these missiles passing through and\nthrough the cuirass and backpiece.\n\nNo reply being obtained to the summons to surrender, they proceeded to\nbreak in with their battle-axes the door of the little turret. Rushing in\nwith axe and pike, they were astonished to find the place empty. A glance\nover the wall showed the rope still hanging, and the manner of the escape\nbecame manifest. The fugitives were already out of sight, and the\nknights, furious at the escape of the men who had bearded them in the\nheart of the city with such audacity, and had slain the lord baron and\nseveral of his knights, gave orders that an instant pursuit should be\norganized. It was, however, a full half hour before the city gates were\nthrown open, and a strong troop of knights and mounted men issued out.\n\nCuthbert had been certain that an instant pursuit would be set on foot,\nand the moment that he was out of sight of the battlements, he changed\nthe direction in which he had started, and turning at right angles,\nswept round the city, still keeping at a distance, until he reached the\nside next the mountains, and then plunged into the woods on the lower\nslopes of the hills.\n\n\"They will,\" he said, as they halted breathless from their run, \"follow\nthe road towards the south, and scour the country for awhile before it\noccurs to their thick German skulls that we have doubled back on our\ntracks. Why, what is it, Cnut?\"\n\nThis exclamation was provoked by the forester throwing himself on his\nknees before Sir Cuthbert, and imploring his pardon for the dire strait\ninto which his imprudence had drawn him.\n\n\"It was a dire strait, certainly, Cnut. But if you got me into it, at\nleast you have extricated me; and never say more about it, for I myself\nwas near committing the imprudence to which you gave way, and I can well\nunderstand that your English blood boiled at the sight of the outrage to\nthe flag of England. Now, let us waste no time in talk, but, keeping to\nthe foot of this mountain, make along as far as we can to the west. We\nmust cling to the hills for many days' march before we venture again to\ntry to cross the plains. If possible, we will keep on this way until we\nreach the confines of the country of the Swiss, who will assuredly give\nus hospitality, and who will care little for any threats of these German\nbarons, should they hear that we have reached their asylum.\"\n\nBy nightfall they had already travelled many leagues, and making a fire\nin the wood, Cuthbert asked Cnut for an account of what had taken place\non the previous day.\n\n\"We ran for life, Sir Cuthbert, and had not noticed that you had been\ndrawn into the fray. Had we done so, we would have remained, and sold our\nlives with yours; but hoping that you had passed unnoticed in the crowd,\nand that you would find some means to rejoin us, we kept upon our way.\nAfter running down three streets, we passed a place where a courtyard\nwith stables ranged round it was open. There were none about, and we\nentered, and, taking refuge in a loft, hid ourselves beneath some\nprovender. There we remained all night, and then borrowing some apparel\nwhich some of the stablemen had hung up on the walls, we issued into the\ntown. As we neared the great square we saw some men employed in erecting\na platform in the midst, and a suspicion that all might not be right, and\nthat you might have fallen into the hands of these German dogs, beset our\nminds. After much consultation we determined to see what the affair\nmeant, and making our way on to the walls, which, indeed, were entirely\ndeserted, we took refuge in that turret where you saw us. Seeing the\ncrowd gather, and being still more convinced that some misfortune was\nabout to occur, I again went back to the stables, where I had noticed a\nlong rope used by the carters for fastening their loads to the waggons.\nWith this I returned, for it was clear that if we had to mingle in this\nbusiness it would be necessary to have a mode of escape. Of the rest you\nare aware. We saw the knights coming out of the castle, with that portly\nbaron, their lord, at their head. We saw the block and the headsman upon\nthe platform, and were scarcely surprised when you were led out, a\nprisoner, from the gates. We judged that what did happen would ensue.\nSeeing that the confusion wrought by a sudden attack from men perched up\naloft as we were, commanding the courtyard, and being each of us able to\nhit a silver mark at the distance of 100 yards, would be great indeed, we\njudged that you might be able to slip away unobserved, and were sure that\nyour quick wit would seize any opportunity which might offer. Had you not\nbeen able to join us, we should have remained in the turret and sold our\nlives to the last, as, putting aside the question that we could never\nreturn to our homes, having let our dear lord die here, we should not, in\nour ignorance of the language and customs of the country, have ever been\nable to make our way across it. We knew, however, that before this turret\nwas carried we could show these Germans how five Englishmen, when brought\nto bay, can sell their lives.\"\n\nThey had not much difficulty in obtaining food in the forest, for game\nabounded, and they could kill as many deer as seemed fit to them. As Cnut\nsaid, it was difficult to believe that they were not back again in the\nforest near Evesham, so similar was their life to that which they had led\nthree years before. To Cnut and the archers, indeed, it was a pleasanter\ntime than any which they had passed since they had left the shores of\nEngland, and they blithely marched along, fearing little any pursuit\nwhich might be set on foot, and, indeed, hearing nothing of their\nenemies. After six days' travel they came upon a rude village, and here\nCuthbert learnt from the people--with much difficulty, however, and\npantomime, for neither could understand a word spoken by the other--that\nthey were now in one of the Swiss cantons, and therefore secure from all\npursuit by the Germans. Without much difficulty Cuthbert engaged one of\nthe young men of the village to act as their guide to Basle, and here,\nafter four days' travelling, they arrived safely. Asking for the\nresidence of the Burgomaster, Cuthbert at once proceeded thither, and\nstated that he was an English knight on the return from the Crusades;\nthat he had been foully entreated by the Lord of Fussen, who had been\nkilled in a fray by his followers; and that he besought hospitality and\nrefuge from the authorities of Basle.\n\n\"We care little,\" the Burgomaster said, \"what quarrel you may have had\nwith your neighbours. All who come hither are free to come and go as they\nlist, and you, as a knight on the return from the Holy Land, have a claim\nbeyond that of an ordinary traveller.\"\n\nThe Burgomaster was himself able to speak French, and summoning several\nof the councillors of the town, he requested Cuthbert to give a narrative\nof his adventures; which he did. The councillors agreed with the\nBurgomaster that Cuthbert must be received hospitably; but the latter saw\nthat there was among many of them considerable doubt as to the expediency\nof quarrelling with a powerful neighbour. He therefore said to the\nBurgomaster,--\n\n\"I have no intention, honourable sir, of taking up any prolonged\nresidence here. I only ask to be furnished with a charger and arms, and\nin payment of these I will leave this gold chain, the gift of King\nRichard himself, as a gage, and will on my return to my country forward\nto you the value of the arms and horse, trusting that you will return the\nchain to me.\"\n\nThe Burgomaster, however, said that the city of Basle was not so poor\nthat it need take the gage of an honourable knight, but that the arms\nand charger he required should be given him in a few hours, and that he\nmight pay the value in London to a Jew merchant there who had relations\nwith one at Basle. Full instructions were given to him, and he resolved\nto travel down upon the left bank of the Rhine, until he reached\nLorraine, and thence to cross into Saxony. The same afternoon the\npromised horse and arms were provided, and Cuthbert, delighted again to\nbe in harness, and thanking courteously the Burgomaster and council for\ntheir kindness, started with his followers on his journey north. These\nlatter had been provided with doublets and other garments suitable to\nthe retinue of a knight, and made a better show than they had done since\nthey first left England.\n\nLeaving Basle, they travelled along the left side of the Rhine by easy\nstages. The country was much disturbed, owing to the return and\ndisbandment of so many of the troops employed in the Crusades. These,\ntheir occupation being gone, scattered over the country, and France and\nGermany alike were harassed by bands of military robbers. The wild\ncountry between the borders of Switzerland and Lorraine was specially\nvexed, as the mountains of the Vosges afforded shelter, into which the\nfreebooters could not be followed by the troops of the duke.\n\nUpon the evening of the third day they reached a small inn standing in a\nlonely position near the foot of the mountains.\n\n\"I like not the look of this place,\" Cuthbert said; \"but as we hear that\nthere is no other within a distance of another ten miles, we must e'en\nmake the best of it.\"\n\nThe host received them with extreme and even fawning civility, which by\nno means raised him in the estimation of Cuthbert or Cnut. A rough meal\nwas taken, and they then ascended to the rude accommodation which had\nbeen provided. It was one large room, barely furnished. Upon one side\nstraw was thickly littered down--for in those days beds among the common\npeople were unknown. In a sort of alcove at the end was a couch with a\nrough mattress and coverlet. This Cuthbert took possession of, while his\nfollowers stretched themselves upon the straw.\n\n\"Methinks,\" Cnut said, \"that it were well that one should keep watch at\nthe door. I like not the look of our host, and we are near the spot where\nthe bands of the robbers are said to be busy.\"\n\nTowards morning the archer on guard reported that he could hear the sound\nof many approaching footsteps. All at once sprang to their feet, and\nbetook themselves to their arms. Looking from the window they saw a large\nparty of rough men, whose appearance at once betokened that they were\ndisbanded soldiers--a title almost synonymous in those days with that of\nrobber. With the united strength of the party the truckle bed was\ncarried from the alcove and placed against the door. Cuthbert then threw\nopen the window, and asked in French what they wanted. One of the party,\nwho appeared to be the leader, said that the party had better surrender\nimmediately. He promised them good treatment, and said that the knight\nwould be put to ransom, should it be found that the valuables upon his\nperson were not sufficient to pay the worshipful company present for the\ntrouble which they had taken in waiting upon him. This sally was received\nwith shouts of laughter. Cuthbert replied quietly that he had no\nvaluables upon his person; that if they took him there were none would\npay as much as a silver mark for the ransom of them all; and that the\nonly things that they had to give were sharp arrows and heavy blows.\n\n\"You talk bravely, young sir,\" the man said. \"But you have to do with men\nversed in fight, and caring but little either for knocks or for arrows.\nWe have gone through the Crusades, and are therefore held to be absolved\nfrom all sin, even that so great as would be incurred in the cutting of\nyour knightly throat.\"\n\n\"But we have gone through the Crusades also,\" Cuthbert said, \"and our\npersons are sacred. The sin of slitting our weazands, which you speak of,\nwould therefore be so great that even the absolution on which you rely\nwould barely extend to it.\"\n\n\"We know most of those who have served in the Holy Land,\" the man said\nmore respectfully than he had yet spoken, \"and would fain know with whom\nwe speak.\"\n\n\"I am an Englishman, and a follower of King Richard,\" Cuthbert said, \"and\nam known as Sir Cuthbert of Evesham. As I was the youngest among the\nknights who fought for the holy sepulchre, it may be that my appearance\nis known to you?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" the other said, \"you are he whom they called the Boy Knight, and\nwho was often in the thick of the fray, near to Richard himself. How\ncomes it, Sir Cuthbert, that you are here?\"\n\n\"The fleet was scattered on its return,\" Cuthbert replied, \"and I landed\nwith my followers, well-nigh penniless, at Zara, and have since made my\nway across the Tyrol. I have, then, as you may well suppose, neither\nsilver nor gold about my person; and assuredly neither Philip of France\nnor John of Austria would give a noble for my ransom; and it would be\nlong, methinks, to wait ere John of England would care to ransom one of\nKing Richard's followers.\"\n\nThe brigands spoke for awhile among themselves, and then the\nleader said,--\n\n\"You speak frankly and fairly, Sir Knight, and as you have proved\nyourself indeed a doughty giver of hard blows, and as I doubt not that\nthe archers with you can shoot as straight and as fast as the rest of the\nSaxon breed, we will e'en let you go on your way, for your position is\nbut little better than ours, and dog should not rob dog.\"\n\n\"Thanks, good fellow,\" Cuthbert said. \"We trust that in any case we\nmight have made a strong defence against you; but it would be hard if\nthose who have fought together in the Holy Land, should slay each other\nin this lonely corner of Lorraine.\"\n\n\"Are you seeking adventures or employment, Sir Knight? For if so, myself\nand comrades here would gladly take service with you; and it may be that\nwith a clump of spears you might obtain engagement, either under the Duke\nof Lorraine or he of Cleves.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your offer,\" Cuthbert replied; \"but at present my face is\nturned towards England. King Richard needs all his friends; and there is\nso little chance of sack or spoil, even should we have--which God\nforfend--civil war, that I fear I could ill reward the services which you\noffer me.\"\n\nThe leader and his men shouted an adieu to Cuthbert, and departed for the\nmountains, leaving the latter well pleased with his escape from a fight\nof which the result was doubtful.\n\nJourneying on without further adventure, they came to Nancy, and were\nthere kindly received by the duke, who was not at that time upon good\nterms with Phillip of France, and was therefore well disposed towards the\nEnglish. Cuthbert inquired from him whether any news had been heard of\nKing Richard? but received as a reply that the duke had heard nothing of\nhim since he sailed from Palestine.\n\n\"This is strange,\" Cuthbert said, \"for I myself have journeyed but\nslowly, and have met with many delays. King Richard should long ere this\nhave reached Saxony; and I fear much that some foul treatment has\nbefallen him. On our way, we found how bitter was the feeling among those\nrelated to Conrad of Montferat against him; and the Archduke John is\nstill smarting from the blow which King Richard struck him at Ascalon.\nBut surely they would not be so unknightly as to hinder so great a\nchampion of Christendom as King Richard on his homeward way?\"\n\n\"The Archduke John is crafty and treacherous,\" the duke said; \"and the\nemperor himself would, I think, be not sorry Conrad of Montferat, who\nfalsely allege that the death of their kinsman was caused by King\nRichard. The Archduke John, too, owes him no good-will; and even the\nemperor is evilly disposed towards him. The king travelled under an\nassumed name; but it might well be that he would be recognized upon the\nway. His face was known to all who fought in the East; and his lordly\nmanner and majestic stature could ill be concealed beneath a merchant's\ngarb. Still, lady, as I have been so long in making my way across, it may\nbe that King Richard has been similarly delayed without danger befalling\nhim, and it could hardly be that so important a man as the King of\nEngland would be detained, or come to any misfortune, without the news\nbeing bruited abroad.\"\n\nIn spite of Cuthbert's reassuring words, the duke and duchess were\ngreatly alarmed at the news of King Richard's disappearance, although\nindeed consoled to find that their previous fears, that he had been\ndrowned in the storm or captured by the Moorish corsairs, were unfounded.\n\nThey now requested from Cuthbert the story of what had befallen him since\nhe left the king; and this he related at some length. The duke was\ngreatly interested, and begged Cuthbert at least to remain at his court\nuntil some news might arrive of King Richard.\n\nFor a month Cuthbert tarried at the castle of the Duke of Saxony, where\nhe was nobly entertained, and treated as a guest of much honour. Cnut and\nthe archers were delighted at the treatment they received, for never in\ntheir lives had they been so royally entertained. Their Saxon tongue was\nnigh enough akin to the language spoken here to be understood; and their\ntales of adventure in the Holy Land rendered them as popular among the\nretainers of the duke as their master became with the duke and duchess.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. UNDER THE GREENWOOD.\n\n\nAt the end of a month, news came from England that Sir Baldwin of Bthune\nhad returned there, bearing the news that the King had been arrested at\nGortz, only two days' journey north of the Adriatic--that he had been\nrecognized, and at once captured. He had offered no resistance, finding\nindeed that it would be hopeless so to do. Sir Baldwin had been permitted\nto depart without molestation. He believed that the folk into whose hands\nhe had fallen were retainers of the Archduke John. This news, although\nsad in itself, was yet in some degree reassuring to the duke and his\nwife; for they felt that while the followers of Conrad of Montferat would\nnot hesitate to put King Richard to death should he fall into their\nhands, the Archduke John would not dare to bring upon himself the\nindignation of Europe by such treatment of his royal captive. Cuthbert at\nonce determined to return to England to see Sir Baldwin, and to ascertain\nwhat steps were being taken for the discovery of the prison in which King\nRichard was confined, and for his release therefrom; and also to\nestablish himself in his new dignity as Earl of Evesham. Therefore,\nbidding adieu to the duke and duchess, he started north. The duke\nfurnished him with letters of introduction to the princes through whose\ncountries he would travel; and again crossing the Rhine, he journeyed\nthrough the territories of the Dukes of Cleves and Brabant, and reached\nthe mouth of the Scheldt without interruption. There taking ship, he\nsailed for London.\n\nIt was a long and stormy passage between the mouth of the Scheldt and\nLondon. The vessel in which Cuthbert had shipped was old and somewhat\nunseaworthy, and several times in the force of the gale all on board gave\nup hope for their lives. At last, however, they reached the mouth of the\nThames, and dropping up with the tide, reached London eight days after\ntheir embarcation. The noble charger which the King of Saxony had\npresented to Cuthbert, had suffered greatly, and he feared at one time,\nthat the poor animal would succumb to the effects of the tempest.\nHowever, after entering into smooth water it recovered itself, and on\nlanding near the Tower he found that it was able to support his weight.\nCnut and the archers were, like Cuthbert, delighted to have their feet\nagain upon English soil; and although London did not now strike them with\nthe same wonder which it would have done had they first visited it before\nstarting on their journey--for in many respects it was greatly behind\nsome of the continental cities--yet the feeling of home, and the pleasure\nof being able to understand the conversation of those around them, made\nthe poor fellows almost beside themselves with joy. Beyond the main\npolitical incidents, Cuthbert had heard little of what had passed in\nEngland since his departure; and putting up at a hostelry, he inquired of\nthe host whether Sir Baldwin of Bthune was in London, or whether he was\naway on his estates. The landlord did not know. There were, he said, but\nfew nobles at court, and London was never so dull as at present. As\nCuthbert did not wish his coming home to be known to John until he had\nlearnt something of the position of affairs, he despatched Cnut to the\nTower to inquire privately of some of the officials about the place\nwhether Sir Baldwin was there. Cnut soon returned with the news that he\nhad not been at the court since his return from the Holy Land, and that\nhe was living at his castle down in Dorsetshire. After some hesitation,\nCuthbert resolved to set out to see his friend, and after six days'\ntravel he arrived at the castle of the knight.\n\nSir Baldwin received him with immense joy. He had not heard of him\nsince they parted at Zara, and he feared that a fate similar to that\nwhich had befallen King Richard had overtaken Cuthbert, even if he were\nstill alive.\n\n\"Have you seen aught of the king, our master?\" the good knight inquired.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Cuthbert said. \"I know no more than yourself. Indeed, I hoped\nto have learnt something from you as to the king.\"\n\n\"I was separated from him at Gortz, and while he was taken a prisoner to\nthe archduke, I was allowed to pursue my way. I had many difficulties\nand dangers, and was some weeks in finding my way back. Nothing was\nknown of the king when I returned. Indeed, I was the first bearer of any\ndefinite news concerning him since the day when he sailed from Acre.\nThree weeks ago, as you may have learnt, the news came that he is now\ndetained in captivity by the emperor who demanded his delivery by the\nArchduke John, into whose hands he first fell. But where he is, no one\nexactly knows. The news has created an immense excitement in the\nkingdom, and all are resolved to sacrifice any of their treasures which\nmay be demanded in order to satisfy the ransom which the recreant\nemperor has placed upon the king. Shame is it indeed that a Christian\nsovereign should hold another in captivity. Still more, when that other\nwas returning through his dominions as a crusader coming from the Holy\nLand, when his person should be safe, even to his deadliest enemy. It\nhas long been suspected that he was in the hands either of the emperor,\nor of the archduke, and throughout Europe the feeling of indignation has\nbeen strong; and I doubt not, now that the truth is known, this feeling\nwill be stronger than ever.\"\n\n\"But, now that it is known,\" Cuthbert said, \"I suppose there will be no\ndelay in ransoming the king.\"\n\n\"There will be no delay in raising the ransom,\" Sir Baldwin said. \"But\nthe kingdom is very impoverished by war, by the exactions of Prince John,\nand by those of Langley, who held it for King Richard. He was a loyal\nservant of the king, but an exacting and rapacious prelate. However, I\ndoubt not that the rents of the English nobles will soon be charged with\nsums sufficient for the ransom; and if this avail not, not one of them\nwill grudge their silver flagons and vessels to melt down to make the\ntotal required. But we must not flatter ourselves that he will obtain his\nliberty so soon as the money is raised. Prince John has long been\nyearning for sovereignty. He has long exercised the real, if not the\nnominal, power, and he has been intriguing with the Pope and Phillip of\nFrance for their support for his seizing the crown. He will throw every\nobstacle in the way, as, we may be sure, will Phillip of France,\nRichard's deadly enemy. And now about yourself, Sir Cuthbert; tell me\nwhat has befallen you since we last met.\"\n\nCuthbert related the adventures which had befallen him, and heard those\nof Sir Baldwin.\n\n\"You have not, I suppose,\" the latter remarked, \"as yet seen\nPrince John?\"\n\n\"No,\" Cuthbert replied, \"I thought it better to come down to ask you to\nadvise me on the position of affairs before I attempted to see him.\"\n\n\"You did well,\" Sir Baldwin said. \"When I arrived, I found that the\nproper officials, had, according to King Richard's instructions, drawn up\nthe patent conferring upon you the lands and title of Earl of Evesham,\nbefore leaving Acre, and had received the king's signature to it. This\nwas attested by several of the nobles who were with us and who returned\nsafely to England. Prince John, however, declared that he should not give\nany heed to the document; that King Richard's power over this realm had\nceased before he made it; and that he should bestow the earldom upon\nwhomsoever he chose. As a matter of fact, it has been given to Sir\nRudolph Fleming, a Norman knight and a creature of the prince. The king\nhas also, I hear, promised to him the hand of the young Lady Margaret,\nwhen she shall become of marriageable age. At present she is placed in a\nconvent in Worcester. The abbess is, I believe, a friend of the late\nearl, and the girl had been with her for some time previously. Indeed she\nwent there, I think, when her father left England. This lady was ordered\nto give up her charge to the guardianship of Sir Rudolph; but she refused\nto do so, saying that it would not be convenable for a young lady to be\nunder the guardianship of a bachelor knight having no lady at the head of\nhis establishment, and that therefore she should retain her, in spite of\nthe orders of the Prince. Prince John, I hear, flew into a fury at this;\nbut he did not dare to provoke the anger of the whole of the clergy by\nordering the convent to be violated. And indeed, not only would the\nclergy have been indignant, but many of the great nobles would also have\ntaken their part, for there can be no doubt that the contention of the\nabbess was reasonable; and there is among all the friends of King Richard\na very strong feeling of anger at your having been deprived of the\nearldom. This, however, has, so far, not found much vent in words, for as\nit was uncertain whether you would ever return to claim your rights, it\nwas worth no one's while to embroil himself unnecessarily with the prince\nupon such a subject. God knows that there are subjects enough of dispute\nbetween John Lackland and the English barons without any fresh ones\narising. The whole kingdom is in a state of disturbance. There have been\nseveral risings against Prince John's authority; but these have been, so\nfar, suppressed. Now that we know where King Richard is, and hope for his\nreturn ere very long, it is probable that peace will be maintained; but\nshould treachery prevail, and King Richard's return be prevented, you may\nbe sure that John will not be permitted to mount the throne without the\ndetermined resistance of a large number of the nobles.\"\n\n\"But,\" Cuthbert said, \"John is not the successor to the throne. Prince\nArthur of Brittany was named by King Richard from the first as his\nsuccessor. He is so by blood and by right, and John can have no pretence\nto the throne so long as he lives.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" Sir Baldwin said. \"But, unhappily, in England at present\nmight makes right, and you may be sure that at King Richard's death, be\nit when it may, Prince John will make a bold throw for the throne, and,\naided as he will be by the pope and by Phillip of France, methinks that\nhis chances are better than those of the young prince. A man's power, in\nwarlike times, is more than a boy's. He can intrigue and promise and\nthreaten, while a boy must be in the hands of partisans. I fear that\nPrince Arthur will have troubled times indeed before he mounts the throne\nof England. Should Richard survive until he becomes of age to take the\nfield himself and head armies, he may succeed, for all speak well of him\nas a boy of singular sweetness of disposition, while Prince John is\ndetested by all save those who flatter and live by him. But enough for\nthe present of politics, Cuthbert; let us now to table. It is long since\nwe two feasted together; and, indeed, such meals as we took in the Holy\nLand could scarcely have been called feasts. A boar's head and a good\nroasted capon are worthy all the strange dishes that we had there. I\nalways misdoubted the meat, which seemed to me to smack in flavour of the\nSaracens, and I never could bring myself to inquire whence that strange\nfood was obtained. A stoup of English ale, too, is worth all the Cyprus\nwines, especially when the Cyprus wines are half full of the sand of the\ndesert. Pah! it makes my throat dry to think of those horrible meals. So\nyou have brought Cnut and your four archers safely back with you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Cuthbert said, smiling, \"But they were, I can assure you, a heavy\nweight on me, in spite of their faithfulness and fidelity. Their\nignorance of the language brought most of my troubles upon me, and Cnut\nhad something of the nature of a bull in him. There are certain things\nwhich he cannot stomach, and when he seeth them he rageth like a wild\nbeast, regardless altogether of safety or convenience.\"\n\nIn the evening, the two knights again talked over the course which\nCuthbert should adopt. The elder knight's opinion was that his young\nfriend had best formally claim the title by writing to the king-at-arms,\nand should also announce his return to Prince John, signing himself \"Sir\nCuthbert, Earl of Evesham;\" but that, in the present state of things, it\nwould be unwise for him to attempt to regain his position, should, as was\ncertain to be the case, Prince John refuse to recognize him.\n\n\"You are very young yet,\" Sir Baldwin said, \"not eighteen, I think, and\ncan afford to wait, at any rate, to see whether King Richard returns.\nShould he come back, he will see all these wrongs are righted; and one of\nhis first cares would assuredly be to cast this usurper out of his stolen\ndignities. How old is the Lady Margaret?\"\n\n\"She is fifteen,\" Cuthbert said. \"She was three years younger than I.\"\n\n\"I wish she had been younger,\" Sir Baldwin said. \"At fifteen she is not\nby custom fairly marriageable; but men can strain these points when they\nchoose; and I fear that the news of your coming will hasten both the\nprince and Sir Rudolph in their determination to strengthen the claim of\nthis usurper by marriage with the heiress of Evesham. The Lady Margaret\nand her friends can of course claim that she is a royal ward, and that as\nsuch the king alone can dispose of her person and estates. But,\nunfortunately, force overrides argument.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" Cuthbert said, \"they will never venture to take her by\nforce from the convent?\"\n\n\"They venture a great many strange things in England now,\" Sir Baldwin\nsaid; \"and Worcester is perilously near to Evesham. With a clump of\ntwenty spears, Sir Rudolph might break into the convent and carry off the\nyoung lady, and marry her by force; and although the Church might cry\nout, crying would be of little avail when the deed was done; and a\nhandsome present on the part of Sir Rudolph might go far to shut the\nmouths of many of the complainants, especially as he will be able to say\nthat he has the king's sanction for what he did.\"\n\n\"Methinks,\" Cuthbert said, \"that if such be the case it would be perilous\nindeed to wait for King Richard's return. Assuredly Sir Rudolph would not\ntarry until she attained the age of seventeen, and it may well be that\ntwo years may yet pass before King Richard comes back. It seems to me the\nwiser part will be that I should give Prince John no notice that I am in\nEngland. As you say, such notice would be of no avail in recovering my\nlands and title, but it would put the prince upon his guard; and\nassuredly he and his minions would press forward their measures to obtain\npossession of the person of the Lady Margaret; while, on the other hand,\nno harm can come of my maintaining silence.\"\n\n\"I think that you are right, Sir Cuthbert. It were indeed best that your\nenemies should suppose you either dead or in some dungeon in the Tyrol.\nWhat would you then do?\"\n\n\"I would return to my old home,\" Cuthbert said. \"My lady mother is, I\ntrust, still alive. But I will not appear at her house, but will take\nrefuge in the forest there. Cnut, and the archers with him, were all at\none time outlaws living there, and I doubt not that there are many good\nmen and true still to be found in the woods. Others will assuredly join\nwhen they learn that Cnut is there, and that they are wanted to strike a\nblow for my rights. I shall then bide my time. I will keep a strict watch\nover the castle and over the convent. As the abbess is a friend and\nrelative of Lady Margaret's, I may obtain an interview with her, and warn\nher of the dangers that await her, and ask if she be willing to fulfil\nthe promise of her father, and King Richard's will, in accepting me as\nher husband when due time shall arrive, and whether she will be willing\nthat I should take such steps as I may to deliver her from the\npersecution of Sir Rudolph. If, as I trust, she assents to this, I will\nkeep a watch over the convent as well as the castle, and can then either\nattack the latter, or carry her off from the former, as the occasion may\nappear to warrant. There are plenty of snug cottages round the forest,\nwhere she can remain in concealment in the care of some good farmer's\nwife for months, and we shall be close at hand to watch over her. With\nthe aid of the forest men, Sir Walter took the castle of Sir John of\nWortham; and although Evesham is a far grander pile than that, yet\nmethinks it could be carried by a sudden assault; and we know more of war\nnow than we did then. Prince John may deny me the right of being the Earl\nof Evesham; but methinks before many months I can, if I choose, become\nits master.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty in that matter,\" Sir Baldwin said. \"You might capture\nthe castle with the aid of your outlaws; but you could scarcely hold it.\nThe prince has, ere now, with the aid of those faithful to him and his\nforeign mercenaries, captured stronger holds than that of Evesham; and if\nyou turn his favourite out, you would have a swarm of hornets around you\nsuch as the walls of Evesham could not keep out. It would therefore be\nworse than useless for you to attempt what would be something like an\nact of rebellion against Prince John's authority, and would give him what\nnow he has no excuse for, a ground for putting a price upon your\nhead--and cutting it off if he got the opportunity. You might now present\nyourself boldly at court, and although he might refuse to recognize your\ntitle of earl, yet, as a knight and a crusader who has distinguished\nhimself greatly in the Holy Land, he dare not interfere with your person,\nfor this would be resented by the whole of the chivalry of England.\nStill, I agree with you that your best course is to keep your return a\nsecret. You will then be unwatched and unnoticed, and your enemies will\ntake their time in carrying their designs into effect.\"\n\nTwo days later Cuthbert, attended by his faithful retainers, left Sir\nBaldwin's castle, and travelled by easy stages through Wiltshire and the\nconfines of Gloucestershire up to Worcester. He had been supplied by Sir\nBaldwin with suitable attire for himself and his followers, and now rode\nas a simple knight, without arms or cognizance, journeying from one part\nto another. All the crosses and other crusading signs were laid aside,\nand there was nothing to attract any attention to him upon his passage.\nCuthbert had at first thought of going direct to the convent of\nWorcester, and asking for an interview with Lady Margaret; but he\nreflected that it might be possible that some of the myrmidons of Sir\nRudolph might be keeping a watch over that building, to see that Lady\nMargaret was not secretly removed to some other place of refuge, and that\nthe appearance of a knight before its doors would excite comment and\nsuspicion. He therefore avoided the town, and journeyed straight to the\nforest, where he had so often roamed with Cnut and the outlaws.\n\nHere he found that matters had but little changed since he was last\nthere. Many of those who had fought with him in the Holy Land, and who\nhad returned by sea, had again taken to the forest, joined by many new\nmen whom the exactions of Sir Rudolph had already goaded into revolt.\nCnut was received with enthusiasm, and when he presented Cuthbert to them\nas the rightful heir of Evesham and the well-known friend of the\nforesters, their enthusiasm knew no bounds. They at once accepted him as\ntheir lord and master, and promised to obey his orders, and to lay down\ntheir lives, if necessary, in his cause, as they knew that it was he who\nhad formally obtained the pardon of the forest band, and who had fought\nwith them in their attack on Wortham Castle.\n\nTo Cuthbert's great delight he heard that his mother was in good health,\nalthough she had for some months been grievously fretting over his\ndisappearance and supposed death. Cuthbert hesitated whether he should\nproceed at once to see her; but he feared that the shock of his\nappearance might be too much for her, and that her expressions of joy\nmight make the retainers and others aware of his arrival, and the news\nmight in some way reach the ears of those at the castle. He therefore\ndespatched Cnut to see her, and break the news to her cautiously, and to\nrequest her to arrange for a time when she would either see Cuthbert at\nsome place at a distance from the house, or would so arrange that the\ndomestics should be absent and that he would have an interview with her\nthere unobserved.\n\nCnut was absent some hours, and on his return told Cuthbert that he had\nseen Dame Editha, and that her joy on hearing of her son's safe arrival\nhad caused her no harm, but rather the reverse. The news that King\nRichard had bestowed upon him the title and lands of Evesham was new to\nher, and she was astonished indeed to hear of his elevation. Having heard\nmuch of the character of the pretending earl, she had great fears for the\nsafety of Cuthbert, should his residence in the neighbourhood get to his\nears; and although sure of the fidelity of all her retainers, she feared\nthat in their joy at their young master's return they might let slip some\nincautious word which would come to the ears of some of those at the\ncastle. She therefore determined to meet him at a distance. She had\narranged that upon the following day she would give out that she intended\nto make a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Dunstan, which lay at the edge\nof the forest, to thank him for her recovery from illness, and to pray\nfor the safety of her son.\n\nShe would be carried thither in a litter, and her journey would excite no\ncomment whatever. She would take with her four of her most trusted\nretainers, and would on her arrival at the shrine send them to a\ndistance, in order to pay her devotions undisturbed. Cuthbert was to be\nnear, and the moment he saw them depart, to enter.\n\nThis arrangement was carried out, and the joy of Dame Editha at again\nmeeting her son was deep indeed. He had left her a lad of fifteen. He now\nreturned a youth of nearly eighteen, stout and strong beyond his age, and\nlooking far older than he was, from the effect of the hot sun of Syria\nand of the hardships through which he had gone. That he should win his\nspurs upon the first opportunity the earl had promised her, and she\ndoubted not that he would soon attain the rank which his father had held.\nBut that he should return to her a belted earl was beyond her wildest\nthoughts. This, however, was but little in her mind then. It was her son,\nand not the Earl of Evesham, whom she clasped in her arms.\n\nAs the interview must necessarily be a short one, Cuthbert gave her but a\nslight outline of what had happened since they parted, and the\nconversation then turned upon the present position, and upon the steps\nwhich had best be taken.\n\n\"Your peril is, I fear, as great here as when you were fighting the\ninfidels in the Holy Land,\" she said. \"Sir Rudolph has not been here\nlong; but he has proved himself a cruel and ruthless master. He has\ndriven forth many of the old tenants and bestowed their lands upon his\nown servants and retainers. The forest laws he carries out to the fullest\nseverity, and has hung several men who were caught infringing them. He\nhas laid such heavy burdens on all the tenants that remain that they are\nfairly ruined, and if he stay here long he will rule over a desert. Did\nhe dream of your presence here, he would carry fire and sword through the\nforest. It is sad indeed to think that so worthless a knave as this\nshould be a favourite of the ruler of England. But all men say that he is\nso. Thus were you to attack him, even did you conquer and kill him, you\nwould have the enmity of Prince John to contend with; and he spareth\nnone, man or woman, who stand in his way. It will be a bad day indeed\nfor England should our good King Richard not return. I will, as you wish\nme, write to my good cousin, the Lady Abbess of St. Anne's, and will ask\nthat you may have an interview with the Lady Margaret, to hear her wishes\nand opinions concerning the future, and will pray her to do all that she\ncan to aid your suit with the fair young lady, and to keep her at all\nevents safe from the clutches of the tyrant of Evesham.\"\n\nThree days later, a boy employed as a messenger by Dame Editha brought a\nnote to Cuthbert, saying that she had heard from the Abbess of St.\nAnne's, who would be glad to receive a visit from Cuthbert. The abbess\nhad asked his mother to accompany him; but this she left for him to\ndecide. Cuthbert sent back a message in reply, that he thought it would\nbe dangerous for her to accompany him, as any spy watching would report\nher appearance, and inquiries were sure to be set on foot as to her\ncompanion. He said that he himself would call at the convent on the\nfollowing evening after nightfall, and begged her to send word to the\nabbess to that effect, in order that he might, when he presented himself,\nbe admitted at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE ATTEMPT ON THE CONVENT.\n\n\nUpon the following evening Cuthbert proceeded to Worcester. He left his\nhorse some little distance outside the town, and entered on foot. Having\nno apprehension of an attack, he had left all his pieces of armour\nbehind, and was in the quiet garb of a citizen. Cnut attended him--for\nthat worthy follower considered himself as responsible that no harm of\nany sort should befall his young master. The consequences of his own\nimprudence in the Tyrol were ever before his mind, and he determined that\nfrom henceforth there should be no want of care on his part. He\naccompanied Cuthbert to within a short distance of the convent, and took\nup his position in the shade of a house, whence he could watch should any\none appear to be observing Cuthbert's entrance.\n\nUpon ringing the bell, Cuthbert told the porteress, as had been arranged,\nthat he had called on a message from Dame Editha, and he was immediately\nushered into the parlour of the convent, where, a minute or two later, he\nwas joined by the lady abbess. He had when young been frequently to the\nconvent, and had always been kindly received.\n\n\"I am indeed glad to see you, Sir Cuthbert,\" she said, \"though I\ncertainly should not have recognized the lad who used to come here with\nmy cousin, in the stalwart young knight I see before me. You are indeed\nchanged and improved. Who would think that my gossip Editha's son would\ncome to be the Earl of Evesham! The Lady Margaret is eager to see you;\nbut I think that you exaggerate the dangers of her residence here. I\ncannot think that even a minion of Prince John would dare to violate the\nsanctity of a convent.\"\n\n\"I fear, good mother,\" Cuthbert said, \"that when ambition and greed are\nin one scale, reverence for the holy church will not weigh much in the\nother. Had King Richard been killed upon his way home, or so long as\nnothing was heard of him, Sir Rudolph might have been content to allow\nmatters to remain as they were, until at least Lady Margaret attained an\nage which would justify him in demanding that the espousal should be\ncarried out. But the news which has now positively been ascertained, that\nthe king is in the hands of the emperor, and the knowledge that sooner or\nlater his freedom will be obtained, will hasten the friends of the\nusurper to make the most of their advantage. He knows that the king would\nat once upon his return annul the nomination of Sir Rudolph to the\nearldom which had previously been bestowed upon me. But he may well think\nthat if before that time he can secure in marriage the person of the late\nearl's daughter, no small share of the domains may be allotted to him as\nher dowry, even if he be obliged to lay by his borrowed honours. You\nwill, unless I am greatly mistaken, hear from him before long.\"\n\nThe abbess looked grave.\n\n\"There is much in what you say, Sir Cuthbert; and indeed a certain\nconfirmation is given to it by the fact that only yesterday I received a\nletter from Sir Rudolph, urging that now the Lady Margaret is past the\nage of fifteen, and may therefore be considered marriageable, the will of\nthe prince should be carried into effect, and that she should for the\npresent be committed to the charge of the Lady Clara Boulger, who is the\nwife of a friend and associate of Sir Rudolph. He says that he should not\nwish to press the marriage until she attains the age of sixteen, but that\nit were well that his future wife should become accustomed to the outside\nworld, so as to take her place as Castellan of Evesham with a dignity\nbefitting the position. I wrote at once to him saying, that in another\nyear it would, in my poor judgment, be quite time to think about such\nworldly matters; that at the present the Lady Margaret was receiving an\neducation suitable to her rank; that she was happy here; and that unless\nconstrained by force--of which, I said, I could not suppose that any\npossibility existed--I should not surrender the Lady Margaret into any\nhands whatsoever, unless, indeed, I received the commands of her lawful\nguardian, King Richard.\"\n\n\"You said well, holy mother,\" Sir Cuthbert said. \"But you see the hawks\nscent the danger from afar, and are moving uneasily already. Whether they\nconsider it so pressing that they will dare to profane the convent, I\nknow not. But I am sure that should they do so, they will not hesitate a\nmoment at the thought of the anger of the church. Prince John has already\nshown that he is ready, if need be, to oppose the authority of the holy\nfather, and he may well, therefore, despise any local wrath that might be\nexcited by an action which he can himself disavow, and for which, even at\nthe worst, he need only inflict some nominal punishment upon his vassal.\nBethink thee, lady, whether it would not be safer to send the Lady\nMargaret to the care of some person, where she may be concealed from the\nsearch of Sir Rudolph.\"\n\n\"I would gladly do so,\" the abbess said, \"did I know of such a person or\nsuch a place. But it is difficult indeed for a young lady of rank to be\nconcealed from such sharp searchers as Sir Rudolph would be certain to\nplace upon her track. Your proposal that she should take refuge in the\nhouse of some small franklin near the forest, I cannot agree to. In the\nfirst place, it would demean her to be so placed; and in the second, we\ncould never be sure that the report of her residence there might not\nreach the ears of Sir Rudolph. As a last resource, of course such a step\nwould be justifiable, but not until at least overt outrages have been\nattempted. Now I will call Lady Margaret in.\"\n\nThe young girl entered with an air of frank gladness, but was startled at\nthe alteration which had taken place in her former playfellow, and paused\nand looked at the abbess, as if inquiring whether this could be really\nthe Cuthbert she had known. Lady Margaret was fifteen in years; but she\nlooked much younger. The quiet seclusion in which she had lived in the\nconvent had kept her from approaching that maturity which as an earl's\ndaughter, brought up in the stir and bustle of a castle, she would\ndoubtless have attained.\n\n\"This is indeed Sir Cuthbert,\" the abbess said, \"your old playfellow, and\nthe husband destined for you by your father and by the will of the king.\"\n\nStruck with a new timidity, the girl advanced, and, according to the\ncustom of the times, held up her cheek to be kissed. Cuthbert was almost\nas timid as herself.\n\n\"I feel, Lady Margaret,\" he said, \"a deep sense of my own unworthiness of\nthe kindness and honour which the dear lord your father bestowed upon me;\nand were it not that many dangers threaten, and that it were difficult\nunder the circumstances to find one more worthy of you, I would gladly\nresign you into the hands of such a one were it for your happiness. But\nbelieve me that the recollection of your face has animated me in many of\nthe scenes of danger in which I have been placed; and although even in\nfancy my thoughts scarcely ventured to rise so high, yet I felt as a true\nknight might feel for the lady of his love.\"\n\n\"I always liked you, Sir Cuthbert,\" the girl said frankly, \"better than\nany one else next to my father, and gladly submit myself to his will. My\nown inclinations indeed, so far as is maidenly, go with his. These are\ntroubled times,\" she said anxiously, \"and our holy mother tells me that\nyou fear some danger is overhanging me.\"\n\n\"I trust that the danger may not be imminent,\" Cuthbert answered. \"But\nknowing the unscrupulous nature of the false Earl of Evesham, I fear that\nthe news that King Richard is found will bestir him to early action. But\nyou can rely, dear lady, on a careful watch being kept over you night and\nday; and should any attempt be made to carry you away, or to put force\nupon you, be assured that assistance will be at hand. Even should any\nattempt succeed, do not lose heart, for rescue will certainly be\nattempted; and I must be dead, and my faithful followers crushed, before\nyou can become the bride of Sir Rudolph.\"\n\nThen turning to other subjects, he talked to her of the life he had led\nsince he last saw her. He told her of the last moments of her father, and\nof the gallant deeds he had done in the Holy Land.\n\nAfter waiting for two hours, the abbess judged that the time for\nseparation had arrived; and Cuthbert, taking a respectful adieu of his\nyoung mistress, and receiving the benediction of the abbess, departed.\n\nHe found Cnut on guard at the point where he had left him.\n\n\"Have you seen aught to give rise to suspicion?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Cnut said, \"the place is undoubtedly watched. Just after you had\nentered, a man came from that house yonder and went up to the gate, as if\nhe would fain learn by staring at its iron adornments the nature of him\nwho had passed in. Then he re-entered his house, and if I mistake not is\nstill on the watch at that casement. If we stand here for a minute or\ntwo, perchance he may come out to see what delays you in this dark\ncorner, in which case I may well give him a clout with my axe which will\nsettle his prying.\"\n\n\"Better not,\" Cuthbert said. \"We can retire round this corner and so\navoid his observation; and were his body found slain here, suspicion\nwould be at once excited in the mind of his employer. At present he can\nhave no ground for any report which may make the knight uneasy, for he\ncan but know that a gentleman has entered, and remained for two hours at\nthe convent, and he will in no way connect my visit with the Lady\nMargaret.\"\n\nThey had just turned the corner which Cuthbert indicated, when a man came\nup rapidly behind them and almost brushed them as he passed, half-turning\nround and trying to gaze into their faces. Cnut at once assumed the\naspect of an intoxicated person, and stretching forth his foot, with a\ndexterous shove pushed the stranger into the gutter. The latter rose with\na fierce cry of anger; but Cnut with a blow of his heavy fist again\nstretched him on the ground, this time to remain quiet until they had\nwalked on and passed out of sight.\n\n\"A meddling fool,\" Cnut grumbled. \"He will not, methinks, have much to\nreport to Sir Rudolph this time. Had I thought that he had seen your\nface, I would have cleft his skull with no more hesitation than I send\nan arrow into the brain of a stag in the forest.\"\n\nAs they journeyed along, Cuthbert informed Cnut of what the abbess had\ntold him; and the latter agreed that a watch must be placed on the\nconvent, and that a force must be kept as near as possible at hand so as\nto defeat any attempt which might be made.\n\nThe next day one of the forest men who had been a peaceable citizen, but\nwho had been charged with using false weights and had been condemned to\nlose his ears, repaired to Worcester. His person was unknown there, as he\nhad before lived at Gloucester. He hired a house in the square in which\nthe convent was situated, giving out that he desired to open a house of\nbusiness for the sale of silks, and for articles from the Low Countries.\nAs he paid down earnest-money for the rent, no suspicion whatever was\nexcited. He at once took up his abode there, having with him two stout\nserving-men, and a 'prentice boy; and from that time two sets of watchers\nobserved without ceasing what passed at the Convent of St. Anne.\n\nAt a distance of half a mile from the road leading between Worcester and\nEvesham, stood a grange, which had for some time been disused, the ground\nbelonging to it having been sequestrated and given to the lord of an\nadjoining estate, who did not care to have the grange occupied. In this,\nten men, headed by Cnut, took up their residence, blocking up the window\nof the hall with hangings, so that the light of the fire kindled within\nwould not be observed.\n\nTwo months passed on without any incident of importance. The feeling\nbetween the outlaws in the forest and the retainers of the false Earl of\nEvesham was becoming much embittered. Several times the foresters of the\nlatter, attempting pursuit of men charged with breaking the game laws,\nwere roughly handled. These on making their report were sent back again,\nsupported by a force of footmen; but these, too, were driven back, and\nthe authority of Sir Rudolph was openly defied.\n\nGradually it came to his ears that the outlaws were commanded by a man\nwho had been their leader in times gone by, but who had been pardoned,\nand had, with a large number of his band, taken service in the army of\nthe crusaders; also, that there was present a stranger, whose manner and\nthe deference paid to him by Cnut proclaimed him to be of gentle blood.\nThis news awakened grave uneasiness on the part of Sir Rudolph. The\nknight caused inquiries to be made, and ascertained that Cnut had been\nespecially attached to the young Cuthbert, and that he had fought under\nthe Earl of Evesham's banner. It seemed possible then that with him had\nreturned the claimant for the earldom; and in that case Sir Rudolph felt\nthat danger menaced him, for the bravery of the Earl of Evesham's\nadopted son had been widely spoken of by those who had returned from the\nHoly Land.\n\nSir Rudolph was a man of forty, tall and dark, with Norman features. He\nheld the Saxons in utter contempt, and treated them as beings solely\ncreated to till the land for the benefit of their Norman lords. He was\nbrave and fearless, and altogether free from the superstition of the\ntimes. Even the threats of the pope, which although Prince John defied\nthem yet terrified him at heart, were derided by his follower, who feared\nno one thing in the world, save, perhaps, the return of King Richard from\ncaptivity.\n\nNo sooner had the suspicion that his rival was in the neighbourhood\npossessed him, than he determined that one of two things must be carried\nout: either Sir Cuthbert must be killed, or the Lady Margaret must be\ncarried off and forced to accept him as her husband. First he endeavoured\nto force Sir Cuthbert to declare himself, and to trust to his own arm to\nput an end to his rival. To that end he caused a proclamation to be\nwritten, and to be affixed to the door of the village church at the fair\nof Evesham.\n\nCnut and several of his followers were there, all quietly dressed as\nyeomen. Seeing a crowd round the door of the church, he pressed forward.\nBeing himself unable to read writing, he asked one of the burgesses what\nwas written upon the paper which caused such excitement.\n\n\"It is,\" the burgess said, \"in the nature of a cartel or challenge from\nour present lord, Sir Rudolf. He says that it having come to his ears\nthat a Saxon serf, calling himself Sir Cuthbert, Earl of Evesham, is\nlurking in the woods and consorting with outlaws and robbers, he\nchallenges him to appear, saying that he will himself, grievously\nalthough he would demean himself by so doing, yet condescend to meet him\nin the lists with sword and battle-axe, and to prove upon his body the\nfalseness of his averments. Men marvel much,\" the burgess continued, \"at\nthis condescension on the earl's part. We have heard indeed that King\nRichard, before he sailed for England, did, at the death of the late good\nearl, bestow his rank and the domains of Evesham upon Sir Cuthbert, the\nson of the Dame Editha. Whether it be true or not, we cannot say; but it\nseems strange that such honour should have been bestowed upon one so\nyoung. In birth indeed he might aspire to the rank, since his father, Sir\nWalter, was a brave knight, and the mother, Dame Editha, was of good\nSaxon blood, and descended from those who held Evesham before the arrival\nof the Normans.\"\n\nCnut's first impulse was to stride forward and to tear down the\nproclamation. But the remembrance of his solemn determination not in\nfuture to act rashly, came across him, and he decided to take no\nsteps until he had reported the facts to his master, and taken his\ncounsel thereon.\n\nCuthbert received the news with much indignation.\n\n\"There is nought that I should like better,\" he said, \"than to try my\nstrength against that of this false traitor. But although I have proved\nmy arm against the Saracens, I think not that it is yet strong enough to\ncope against a man who, whatsoever be his faults, is said to be a valiant\nknight. But that would not deter me from attempting the task. It is\ncraftily done on the part of Sir Rudolph. He reckons that if I appear he\nwill kill me; that if I do not appear, I shall be branded as a coward,\nand my claims brought into disrepute. It may be, too, that it is a mere\nruse to discover if I be in the neighbourhood. Some rumours thereof may\nhave reached him, and he has taken this course to determine upon their\ntruth. He has gone too far, and honest men will see in the cartel itself\na sign that he misdoubts him that my claims are just; for were I, as he\nsays, a Saxon serf, be sure that he would not condescend to meet me in\nthe lists as he proposes. I trust that the time will come when I may do\nso. But, at present, I will submit to his insult rather than imperil the\nsuccess of our plans, and, what is of far greater importance, the safety\nand happiness of the Lady Margaret, who, did aught befall me, would\nassuredly fall into his hands.\"\n\nAfter some thought, however, Cuthbert drew up an answer to the knight's\nproclamation. He did not in this speak in his own name, but wrote as if\nthe document were the work of Cnut. It was worded as follows: \"I, Cnut, a\nfree Saxon and a leader of bowmen under King Richard in the Holy Land, do\nhereby pronounce and declare the statements of Sir Rudolph, miscalled\nthe Earl of Evesham, to be false and calumnious. The earldom was, as\nRudolph well knows, and as can be proved by many nobles and gentlemen of\nrepute who were present with King Richard, granted to Sir Cuthbert, King\nRichard's true and faithful follower. When the time shall come, Sir\nCuthbert will doubtless be ready to prove his rights. But at present\nright has no force in England, and until the coming of our good King\nRichard must remain in abeyance. Until then, I support the title of Sir\nCuthbert, and do hereby declare Sir Rudolph a false and perjured knight;\nand warn him that if he falls into my hands it will fare but badly with\nhim, as I know it will fare but badly with me should I come into his.\"\n\nAt nightfall the cartel of Sir Rudolph was torn down from the church and\nthat of Cnut affixed in its place. The reading thereof caused great\nastonishment in Evesham, and the rage of Sir Rudolph, when the news came\nto his ears, was very great. Cuthbert was sure that this affair would\nquicken the intentions of Sir Rudolph with regard to the Lady Margaret,\nand he received confirmation of this in a letter which the abbess sent\nhim, saying that she had received another missive from Sir Rudolph,\nauthoritatively demanding in the king's name the instant surrender of\nLady Margaret to him. That night forty archers stole, one by one, quietly\ninto Worcester, entering the town before the gates were shut, and so\nmingling with the citizens that they were unobserved. When it was quite\ndark they quietly took their way, one by one, to the square in which\nstood the convent, and were admitted into the shop of Master Nicholas,\nthe silk mercer.\n\nThe house was a large one, with its floors overhanging each the one\nbeneath it, as was the custom of the time, and with large casements\nrunning the whole width of the house.\n\nThe mercer had laid by a goodly store of provisions, and for three days\nthe troop, large as it was, was accommodated there. Cuthbert himself\nwas with them, Cnut remaining at the grange with the ten men originally\nsent there.\n\nOn the third day Sir Rudolph, with a number of knights and men-at-arms,\narrived in the town, giving out that he was passing northwards, but he\nwould abide that night at the hostelry. A great many of his men-at-arms\ndid, as those on the watch observed, enter one by one into the town.\nThe people of Worcester were somewhat surprised at this large\naccompaniment of the earl, but thought no harm. The Abbess of St.\nAnne's, however, was greatly terrified, as she feared that some evil\ndesign might be intended against her. She was, however, reassured in\nthe evening by a message brought by a boy, to the effect that succour\nwould be near, whatsoever happened.\n\nAt midnight a sudden uproar was heard in the streets of Worcester.\n\nA party of men fell upon the burgesses guarding the gate of the town,\ndisarmed them, and took possession of it. At the same time those who had\nput up at the hostelry with Sir Rudolph suddenly mounted their horses,\nand with a great clatter rode down the streets to the Convent of St.\nAnne. Numbers of men on foot also joined, and some sixty in all suddenly\nappeared before the great gate of the convent. With a thundering noise\nthey knocked at the door, and upon the grating being opened Sir Rudolph\nhimself told the porteress who looked through it, that she was to go at\nonce to the abbess and order her to surrender the body of the Lady\nMargaret to him, in accordance with the order of Prince John; adding,\nthat if within the space of five minutes the order was not complied with,\nhe would burst in the gates of the convent and take her for himself. In\nanother minute a casement opened above, and the abbess herself appeared.\n\n\"Rash man,\" she said to Sir Rudolph, \"I warn you against committing the\nsin of sacrilege. Neither the orders of Prince John nor of any other\npotentate can over-ride the rights of the holy church; and should you\nventure to lay the hand of force upon this convent you will be placed\nunder the anathema of the church, and its spiritual terrors will be\ndirected against you.\"\n\n\"I am prepared to risk that, holy mother,\" Sir Rudolph said, with a\nlaugh. \"So long as I am obeying the orders of my prince, I care nought\nfor those of any foreign potentate, be he pope or be he emperor. Three\nminutes of the time I gave you have elapsed, and unless within two more\nthe Lady Margaret appears at the gate I will batter it down; and you may\nthink yourself lucky if I do not order my men to set light to it and to\nsmoke you out of your hole.\"\n\nThe abbess closed the window, and as she did so the long row of casements\nin the house of Master Nicholas were opened from top to bottom, and a\nvolley of sixty clothyard arrows was poured into the group closely\nstanding round the gate. Many fell, killed outright, and shouts of rage\nand pain were heard arising.\n\nFurious at this unexpected attack, Sir Rudolph turned, and commanded\nthose with him to attack the house whence this volley of missiles had\ncome. But even while he spoke another flight of arrows, even more deadly\nthan the last, was poured forth. One of the knights standing by the side\nof Sir Rudolph fell, shot through the brain. Very many of the common men,\nundefended by harness, fell shot through and through; and an arrow\npiercing the joint of the armour of Sir Rudolph, wounded him in the\nshoulder. In vain the knight stormed and raged and ordered his men to\nadvance. The suddenness of the attack seemed to his superstitious\nfollowers a direct answer from heaven to the words of the abbess. Their\nnumber was already seriously lessened, and those who were in case to do\nso at once took flight and scattered through the city, making for the\ngate, which had already been seized by Sir Rudolph's men.\n\nFinding himself alone with only a few of his knights and principal\nmen-at-arms remaining, while the storm of arrows continued unabated, Sir\nRudolph was forced to order his men to retreat, with many fierce threats\nof the vengeance which he would hereafter take.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. A DASTARDLY STRATAGEM.\n\n\nThe return of Sir Rudolph's party to Evesham was not unmarked by\nincident, for as they passed along the road, from an ambush in a wood\nother archers, whose numbers they could not discover, shot hard upon\nthem, and many fell there who had escaped from the square at Worcester.\nWhen the list was called upon the arrival at the castle, it was found\nthat no less than thirty of those who had set out were missing, while\nmany others were grievously wounded.\n\nThe noise of the tumult in the square of the convent aroused the whole\ntown of Worcester. Alarm bells were rung; and the burgesses, hastily\narming themselves, poured into the streets. Directed by the sound, they\nmade their way to the square, and were astonished at finding it entirely\ndeserted, save for some twenty men, lying dead or dying in front of the\ngate of the convent, pierced with long arrows. They speedily found that\nSir Rudolph and his troop had departed; and further inquiry revealed the\nfact that the burgher guard at one of the gates had been overpowered and\nwere prisoners in the watchroom. These could only say that they were\nsuddenly seized, all being asleep save the one absolutely on guard. They\nknew nothing more than that a few minutes later there was a great clatter\nof horsemen and men on foot leaving the city. Unable to find any solution\nto this singular circumstance, but satisfied that Sir Rudolph had\ndeparted, and that no more disturbance was likely to arise that night,\nthe burgesses again betook themselves to their beds, having closed the\ngates and placed a strong guard over them, determining next morning to\nsift the affair to the bottom.\n\nIn the morning the leading burgesses met in council, and finding none who\ncould give them any information, the mayor and two of the councillors\nrepaired to the convent, where they asked for an interview with the lady\nabbess. Mightily indignant were they at hearing that Sir Rudolph had\nattempted to break into the convent, and to carry off a boarder residing\nthere. But the abbess herself could give them no further news. She said\nthat after she retired from the window, she heard great shouts and cries,\nand that almost immediately afterwards the whole of the party in front\nhastily retired.\n\nThat Sir Rudolph had been attacked by a party of archers was evident; but\nwhence they had shot, or how they had come upon the spot at the time, or\nwhither they had gone, were mysteries that could not be solved. In the\nsearch which the authorities made, however, it was discovered that the\nhouse of the draper, Master Nicholas, was closed. Finding that summonses\nto open were unanswered, the door was broken in, and the premises were\nfound in confusion. No goods of any kind were discovered there, but many\nbales filled with dried leaves, bark of trees, and other worthless\nmatters. Such goods as had been displayed in the window had clearly been\ncarried away. Searching the house, they found signs that a considerable\nnumber of men had been concealed there, and although not knowing whence\nthe body of archers could have come, they concluded that those who\ndefeated the attempt of Sir Rudolph must have been hidden in the draper's\nhouse. The singularity of this incident gave rise to great excitement;\nbut the indignation against Sir Rudolph was in no way lessened by the\nfact that his attempt had been defeated, not by the townsmen themselves,\nbut by some unknown force.\n\nAfter much consultation on the part of the council, it was resolved that\na deputation, consisting of the mayor and the five senior councillors,\nshould resort to London, and there demand from the prince redress for the\ninjury put upon their town by Sir Rudolph. These worthy merchants betook\nthemselves to London by easy stages, and upon their arrival there were\nkept for some days before they could obtain an interview with King John.\nWhen they appeared before him and commenced telling their story, the\nprince fell into sudden rage.\n\n\"I have heard of this matter before,\" he said, \"and am mightily angry\nwith the people of Worcester, inasmuch as they have dared to interfere to\nprevent the carrying out of my commands. The Earl of Evesham has written\nto me, that thinking to scare the abbess of St. Anne's into a compliance\nwith the commands which I had laid upon her, and to secure the delivery\nof a contumacious ward of the crown, he had pretended to use force,\nhaving, however, no idea of carrying his threats into effect. When, as he\ndoubted not, the abbess was on the point of yielding up the ward, the\ngood knight was suddenly set upon by the rascals of the town, who slew\nsome of his companions and followers, and did grievously ill-treat the\nremainder. This,\" said the prince, \"you now pretend was done by a party\nof men of whose presence in the town you had no cognizance. Your good\nsense must be small, if you think that I should believe such a tale as\nthis. It is your rascaldom at Worcester which interfered to prevent my\nwill being carried out, and I have a goodly mind to order the troop of\nSir Charles Everest, which is now marching towards Evesham, to sack the\ntown, as a punishment for its rebellion. As, however, I am willing to\nbelieve that you and the better class of burgesses were in ignorance of\nthe doings of the rougher kind, I will extend mercy towards the city, and\nwill merely inflict a fine of 3000 golden marks upon it.\"\n\nThe mayor attempted humbly to explain and to entreat; but the prince was\nseized with a sudden passion, and threatened if he said more he would at\nonce cast him and his fellows into durance. Therefore, sadly crestfallen\nat the result of their mission, the mayor and councillors returned to\nWorcester, where their report caused great consternation. This was\nheightened by the fact that upon the following day Sir Charles Everest,\nwith 500 mercenaries of the prince, together with Sir Rudolph and his\nfollowing, and several other barons favourable to the cause of the\nprince, were heard to be approaching the town.\n\nWorcester was capable of making a stout defence, but seeing that no help\nwas likely to be forthcoming, and fearing the utter ruin of the town\nshould it be taken by storm, the council, after sitting many hours in\ndeliberation, determined to raise the money required to pay the fine\ninflicted by the prince. The bolder sort were greatly averse to this\ndecision, especially as a letter had been received, signed \"Cuthbert,\nEarl of Evesham,\" offering, should the townspeople decide to resist the\nunjust demands of Prince John, to enter the town with 150 archers to\ntake part in its defence. With this force, as the more ardent spirits\nurged, the defeat of any attempt to carry it by storm would be assured.\nBut the graver men argued that even if defeated for the first time,\nfurther attempts would be made, and as it was likely that King Richard\nwould not return for a long time, and that Prince John might become\nSovereign of England, sooner or later the town must be taken, and, in\nany case, its trade would for a long time be destroyed, and great\nsuffering inflicted upon all; therefore, that it was better to pay the\nfine now than to risk all these evils, and perhaps the infliction of a\nheavier impost upon them.\n\nThe abbess was kept informed by friends in the council of the course of\nthe proceedings. She had in the meantime had another interview with Sir\nCuthbert, and had determined, seeing that Prince John openly supported\nthe doings of his minion, it would be better to remove the Lady Margaret\nto some other place, as no one could say how the affair might terminate;\nand with 500 mercenaries at his back, Sir Rudolph would be so completely\nmaster of the city that he would be able in broad daylight, did he\nchoose, to force the gates of the convent and carry off the king's ward.\n\nAccordingly, two days before the arrival of the force before the walls of\nWorcester, Lady Margaret left the convent by a postern gate in the rear,\nlate in the evening. She was attended by two of the sisters, both of\nwhom, as well as herself, were dressed as countrywomen. Mules were in\nreadiness outside the city gates, and here Sir Cuthbert, with an escort\nof archers, was ready to attend them. They travelled all night, and\narrived in the morning at a small convent situated five miles from the\ncity of Hereford. The abbess here was a cousin of the Superior of St.\nAnne's, and had already consented to receive Lady Margaret. Leaving her\nat the door, and promising that, as far as possible, he would keep watch\nover her, and that even in the worst she need never despair, Sir Cuthbert\nleft her and returned to the forest.\n\nThe band there assembled varied considerably in numbers, for provisions\ncould not be found continually for a large body of men. The forest was\nindeed very extensive, and the number of deer therein large. Still, for\nthe feeding of 150 men many animals are required and other food. The\nfranklins in the neighbourhood were all hostile to Sir Rudolph, whom they\nregarded as a cruel tyrant, and did their utmost in the way of supplies\nfor those in the forest. Their resources, however, were limited, and it\nwas found necessary to scatter the force, and for a number of them to\ntake up their residence in places a short distance away, forty only\nremaining permanently on guard.\n\nSir Rudolph and his friends entered Worcester, and there received with\ngreat hauteur the apologies of the mayor and council, and the assurance\nthat the townspeople were in nowise concerned in the attack made upon\nhim. To this he pretended disbelief. The fine demanded was paid, the\nprincipal portion in gold, the rest in bills signed by the leading\nmerchants of the place; for after every effort it had been found\nimpossible to collect such a sum within the city.\n\nThe day after he arrived, he again renewed his demand to the abbess for\nthe surrender of the Lady Margaret; this time, however, coming to her\nattended only by two squires, and by a pursuivant bearing the king's\norder for the delivery of the damsel. The abbess met him at the gate,\nand informed him that the Lady Margaret was no longer in her charge.\n\n\"Finding,\" she said, in a fearless tone, \"that the holy walls of this\nconvent were insufficient to restrain lawless men, and fearing that these\nmight be tempted to acts of sacrilege, which might bring down upon them\nthe wrath of the church and the destruction of their souls, I have sent\nher away.\"\n\n\"Whither has she gone?\" Sir Rudolph demanded, half mad with passion.\n\n\"That I decline to say,\" the lady abbess replied. \"She is in good\nhands; and when King Richard returns, his ward shall be delivered to\nhim at once.\"\n\n\"Will you take oath upon the Bible that she is not within these walls?\"\nSir Rudolph exclaimed.\n\n\"My word is sufficient,\" the lady abbess replied calmly. \"But should it\nbe necessary, I should be ready to swear upon the relics that she is\nnot here.\"\n\nA few hours later Sir Rudolph, attended by his own party and by 100 of\nSir Charles Everest's mercenaries, returned to his castle.\n\nThree days afterwards, as Cuthbert was sitting at a rude but hearty meal\nin the forest, surrounded by Cnut and his followers, a hind entered\nbreathless. Cuthbert at once recognized him as one of the servitors of\nhis mother.\n\n\"What is it?\" he exclaimed, leaping to his feet.\n\n\"Terrible news, Master Cuthbert, terrible news!\" exclaimed the man. \"The\nwicked earl came down this morning, with fifty of his men, set fire to\nthe house, and all its buildings and stacks, and has carried off the\nlady, your mother, a prisoner to the castle, on a charge, as he said, of\nharbouring traitors.\"\n\nA cry of fury broke from Cnut and his men.\n\n\"The false traitor shall bitterly regret this outrage,\" Cuthbert\nexclaimed.\n\nHe had in the first excitement seized his arms, and his followers\nsnatched up their bows, as if for instant warfare. A few moments'\nreflection, however, showed to Cuthbert the impossibility of his\nattacking a fortress like Evesham, garrisoned by a strong body of\nwell-armed men, with only the archers of the forest, without implements\nnecessary for such an assault.\n\n\"Send at once, Cnut,\" he said, \"and call in all the band. We cannot take\nthe castle; but we will carry fire and sword round its walls. We will cut\noff all communication from within or from without. If attacked by large\nforces, we will retire upon the wood, returning to our posts without the\nwalls as soon as the force is withdrawn. These heavily armed men can move\nbut slowly; while we can run at full speed. There cannot be more than\nsome twenty horsemen in the castle; and methinks with our arrows and\npikes we can drive these back if they attempt to fall upon us.\"\n\nCnut at once sent off swift-footed messengers to carry out Cuthbert's\norders, and on the following day the whole of the band were again\nassembled in the woods. Just as Cuthbert was setting them in motion, a\ndistant blast of a horn was heard.\n\n\"It is,\" Cuthbert exclaimed, \"the note calling for a parley. Do you,\nCnut, go forward, and see what is demanded. It is probably a messenger\nfrom Sir Rudolph.\"\n\nAfter half-an-hour's absence, Cnut returned, bringing with him a\npursuivant or herald. The latter advanced at once towards Cuthbert, who,\nnow in his full knightly armour, was evidently the leader of the party.\n\n\"I bear to you, Sir Cuthbert, falsely calling yourself Earl of Evesham, a\nmessage from Sir Rudolph. He bids me tell you that the traitress, Dame\nEditha, your mother, is in his hands, and that she has been found guilty\nof aiding and abetting you in your war against Prince John, the Regent of\nthis kingdom. For that offence she has been condemned to die.\"\n\nHere he was interrupted by a cry of rage which broke from the assembled\nforesters. Continuing unmoved, he said,--\n\n\"Sir Rudolph, being unwilling to take the life of a woman, however justly\nforfeited by the law, commands me to say, that if you will deliver\nyourself up to him by to-morrow at twelve, the Dame Editha shall be\nallowed to go free. But that if by the time the dial points to noon you\nhave not delivered yourself up, he will hang her over the battlements of\nthe castle.\"\n\nCuthbert was very pale, and he waved his hand to restrain the fury which\nanimated the outlaws.\n\n\"This man,\" he said to them, \"is a herald, and, as such, is protected by\nall the laws of chivalry. Whatsoever his message, it is none of his. He\nis merely the mouthpiece of him who sent him.\" Then, turning to the\nherald, he said, \"Tell the false knight, your master, on my part, that he\nis a foul ruffian, perjured to all the vows of knighthood; that this act\nof visiting upon a woman the enmity he bears her son, will bring upon him\nthe execration of all men; and that the offer which he makes me is as\nfoul and villainous as himself. Nevertheless, knowing his character, and\nbelieving that he is capable of keeping his word, tell him that by\nto-morrow at noon I will be there; that the lady, my mother, is to leave\nthe castle gates as I enter them; and that though by his foul device he\nmay encompass my death, yet that the curse of every good man will light\nupon him, that he will be shunned as the dog he is, and that assuredly\nheaven will not suffer that deeds so foul should bring with them the\nprize he seeks to gain.\"\n\nThe herald bowed, and, escorted by two archers to the edge of the forest,\nreturned to Evesham Castle.\n\nAfter his departure, an animated council took place. Cnut and the\noutlaws, burning with indignation, were ready to attempt anything. They\nwould, had Cuthbert given the word, have attacked the castle that very\nnight. But Cuthbert pointed out the absolute impossibility of their\ncarrying so strong a place by such an assault, unprovided with engines\nfor battering down the gates. He said that surprise would be impossible,\nas the knight would be sure to take every precaution against it; and that\nin the event of such an attack being attempted, he would possibly carry\nhis threat into execution, and murder Dame Editha before their eyes. Cnut\nwas like a madman, so transported with fury was he; and the archers were\nalso beside themselves. Cuthbert alone retained his calmness. Retiring\napart from the others, he paced slowly backwards and forwards among the\ntrees, deliberating upon the best course to be pursued. The archers\ngathered round the fire and passed the night in long and angry talk, each\nman agreeing that in the event of their beloved leader being sacrificed\nby Sir Rudolph, they would one and all give their lives to avenge him by\nslaying the oppressor whensoever he ventured beyond the castle gates.\n\nAfter a time, Cuthbert called Cnut to him, and the two talked long and\nearnestly. Cnut returned to his comrades with a face less despairing than\nthat he had before worn, and sent off at once a messenger with all speed\nto a franklin near the forest to borrow a stout rope some fifty feet in\nlength, and without telling his comrades what the plans of Sir Cuthbert\nwere, bade them cheer up, for that desperate as the position was, all\nhope was not yet lost.\n\n\"Sir Cuthbert,\" he said, \"has been in grievous straits before now, and\nhas gone through them. Sir Rudolph does not know the nature of the man\nwith whom he has to deal, and we may trick him yet.\"\n\nAt eleven o'clock the next day, from the walls of Evesham Castle a body\nof archers 150 strong were seen advancing in solid array.\n\n\"Think you, Sir Rudolph,\" one of his friends, Sir Hubert of Gloucester,\nsaid to him, \"that these varlets think of attacking the castle?\"\n\n\"They might as well think of scaling heaven,\" Sir Rudolph said. \"Evesham\ncould resist a month's siege by a force well equipped for the purpose;\nand were it not that good men are wanted for the king's service, and\nthat these villains shoot straight and hard, I would open the gates of\nthe castle and launch our force against them. We are two to one as\nstrong as they, and our knights and mounted men-at-arms could alone\nscatter that rabble.\"\n\nConspicuous upon the battlements a gallows had been erected.\n\nThe archers stopped at a distance of a few hundred yards from the castle,\nand Sir Cuthbert advanced alone to the edge of the moat.\n\n\"Sir Rudolph of Eresby, false knight and perjured gentleman,\" he shouted\nin a loud voice, \"I, Sir Cuthbert of Evesham, do denounce you as\nforesworn and dishonoured, and do challenge you to meet me here before\nthe castle in sight of your men and mine, and decide our quarrel as\nheaven may judge with sword and battle-axe.\"\n\nSir Rudolph leant over the battlements, and said,--\n\n\"It is too late, varlet. I condescended to challenge you before, and you\nrefused. You cannot now claim what you then feared to accept. The sun on\nthe dial approaches noon, and unless you surrender yourself before it\nreaches the mark, I will keep my word, and the traitress, your mother,\nshall swing from that beam.\"\n\nMaking a sign to two men-at-arms, these brought forward Dame Editha and\nso placed her on the battlements that she could be seen from below. Dame\nEditha was still a very fair woman, although nigh forty years had rolled\nover her head. No sign of fear appeared upon her face, and in a firm\nvoice she cried to her son,--\n\n\"Cuthbert, I beg--nay, I order you to retire. If this unknightly lord\nventure to carry out his foul threats against me, let him do so.\nEngland will ring with the dastardly deed, and he will never dare show\nhis face again where Englishmen congregate. Let him do his worst. I am\nprepared to die.\"\n\nA murmur rose from the knights and men-at-arms standing round Sir\nRudolph.\n\nSeveral of his companions had from the first, wild and reckless as they\nwere, protested against Sir Rudolph's course, and it was only upon his\nsolemn assurance that he intended but to frighten Sir Cuthbert into\nsurrender, and had no intention of carrying his threats against the lady\ninto effect, that they had consented to take part in the transaction.\nEven now, at the fearless words of the Saxon lady several of them\nhesitated, and Sir Hubert of Gloucester stepped forward to Sir Rudolph.\n\n\"Sir knight,\" he said, \"you know that I am your true comrade and the\nfaithful servant of Prince John. Yet in faith would I not that my name\nshould be mixed up in so foul a deed. I repent me that I have for a\nmoment consented to it. But the shame shall not hang upon the escutcheon\nof Hubert of Gloucester that he stood still when such foul means were\ntried. I pray you, by our long friendship, and for the sake of your own\nhonour as a knight, to desist from this endeavour. If this lady be\nguilty, as she well may be, of aiding her son in his assaults upon the\nsoldiers of Prince John, then let her be tried, and doubtless the court\nwill confiscate her estates. But let her son be told that her life is in\nno danger, and that he is free to go, being assured that harm will not\ncome to her.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse to consent to allow my enemy, who is now almost within\nmy hand, to escape,\" Sir Rudolph said, \"what then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the knight, \"I and my following will at once leave your\nwalls, and will clear ourselves to the brave young knight yonder of all\nhand in this foul business.\"\n\nA murmur of agreement from several of those standing round showed that\ntheir sentiments were in accordance with those of Sir Hubert.\n\n\"I refuse,\" said Rudolph passionately. \"Go, if you will. I am master of\nmy actions, and of this castle.\"\n\nWithout a word, Sir Hubert and two others of the knights present turned,\nand briefly ordering their men-at-arms to follow them, descended the\nstaircase to the courtyard below. Their horses were brought out, the men\nfell into rank, and the gates of the castle were thrown open.\n\n\"Stand to arms!\" Sir Cuthbert shouted to the archers. \"They are going to\nattempt a sortie.\" And hastily he retired to the main body of his men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE FALSE AND PERJURED KNIGHT.\n\n\nAs the band of knights and their retainers issued from the gate, a\ntrumpeter blew a parley, and the three knights advanced alone towards the\ngroup of archers.\n\n\"Sir Cuthbert de Lance,\" Sir Hubert said, \"in the name of myself and my\ntwo friends here we ask your pardon for having so far taken part in this\nfoul action. We did so believing only that Sir Rudolph intended the\ncapture of your lady mother as a threat. Now that we see he was in\nearnest, we wash our hands of the business; and could we in any way atone\nfor our conduct in having joined him, we would gladly do so, consistently\nonly with our allegiance to the Prince Regent.\"\n\nCuthbert bowed courteously.\n\n\"Thanks for your words, Sir Hubert. I had always heard yourself and the\nknights here spoken of as brave and gallant gentlemen, whose sole fault\nwas that they chose to take part with a rebel prince, rather than with\nthe King of England. I rejoice that you have cleared your name of so foul\na blot as this would have placed upon it, and I acknowledge that your\nconduct now is knightly and courteous. But I can no more parley. The sun\nis within a few minutes of twelve, and I must surrender, to meet such\nfate as may befall me.\"\n\nSo saying, with a bow he left them, and again advanced to the\ncastle gate.\n\n\"Sir Rudolph,\" he shouted, \"the hour is at hand. I call upon you to\ndeliver, outside the gate, the lady, my mother. Whether she wills it or\nnot, I call upon you to place her beyond the gate, and I give you my\nknightly word that as she leaves it I enter it.\"\n\nDame Editha would then have attempted resistance; but she saw that it\nwould be useless. With a pale face she descended the steps, accompanied\nby the men-at-arms. She knew that any entreaty to Sir Rudolph would be\nvain, and with the courage of her race she mentally vowed to devote the\nrest of her life to vengeance for her son.\n\nAs the gate opened and she was thrust forth, for a moment she found\nherself in the arms of her son.\n\n\"Courage, mother!\" he whispered; \"all may yet be well.\"\n\nCnut was waiting a few paces behind, and offering his hand to Dame\nEditha, he led her to the group of archers, while Cuthbert, alone,\ncrossed the drawbridge, and entered the portal, the heavy portcullis\nfalling after him.\n\nCnut immediately ordering four of his men to escort Dame Editha to the\nwood with all speed, advanced with his men towards the walls. All had\nstrung their bows and placed their arrows on the ground in front of them\nin readiness for instant use. Cnut himself, with two others carrying the\nrope, advanced to the edge of the moat. None observed their doings, for\nall within the castle were intent upon the proceedings there.\n\nIn the courtyard Sir Rudolph had taken his post, with the captain of the\nmercenaries beside him, and the men-at-arms drawn up in order. He smiled\nsardonically as Cuthbert entered.\n\n\"So, at last,\" he said, \"this farce is drawing to an end. You are in my\npower, and for the means which I have taken to capture you, I will\naccount to the prince. You are a traitor to him; you have attacked and\nslaughtered many of my friends; you are an outlaw defying the law; and\nfor each of these offences your head is forfeited.\"\n\n\"I deny,\" Cuthbert said, standing before him, \"your right to be my\njudge. By my peers only can I be tried. As a knight of England and as\nrightful lord of this castle, I demand to be brought before a jury of\nmy equals.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for rights or for juries,\" said Sir Rudolph. \"I have the\nroyal order for your execution, and that order I shall put into effect,\nalthough all the knights and barons in England objected.\"\n\nCuthbert looked round to observe the exact position in which he was\nstanding. He knew, of course, every foot of the castle, and saw that but\na short distance behind a single row of armed men was the staircase\nleading to the battlements.\n\n\"False and perjured knight,\" he said, taking a step forward, \"I may die;\nbut I would rather a thousand deaths than such a life as yours will be\nwhen this deed is known in England. But I am not yet dead. For myself, I\ncould pardon you; but for the outrage to my mother--\" and with a sudden\nmovement he struck Sir Rudolph in the face with all his strength, with\nhis mailed hand.\n\nWith the blood gushing from his nostrils, the knight fell backwards, and\nSir Cuthbert, with a bound, before the assembly could recover from their\nastonishment at the deed, burst through the line of men-at-arms, and\nsprang up the narrow staircase. A score of men-at-arms started in\npursuit; but Sir Cuthbert gained the battlements first, and without a\nmoment's hesitation sprang upon them and plunged forward, falling into\nthe moat fifty feet below. Here he would have perished miserably, for in\nhis heavy armour he was of course unable to swim a stroke, and his weight\ntook him at once into the mud of the moat. At its margin, however, Cnut\nstood awaiting him, with one end of the rope in his hand. In an instant\nhe plunged in, and diving to the bottom, grasped Cuthbert by the body,\nand twisted the rope round him. The two archers on the bank at once\nhauled upon it, and in a minute Sir Cuthbert was dragged to the bank.\n\nBy this time a crowd of men-at-arms appeared upon the battlements. But as\nthey did so the archers opened a storm of arrows upon them, and quickly\ncompelled them to find shelter. Carried by Cnut and the men with him--for\nhe was insensible--Sir Cuthbert was quickly conveyed to the centre of the\noutlaws, and these at once in a compact body began their retreat to the\nwood. Cuthbert quickly recovered consciousness, and was soon able to\nwalk. As he did so, the gates of the castle were thrown open, and a crowd\nof men-at-arms, consisting of the retainers of the castle and the\nmercenaries of Prince John, sallied forth. So soon as Cuthbert was able\nto move, the archers started at a brisk run, several of them carrying\nCuthbert's casque and sword, and others assisting him to hurry along. The\nrear ranks turned as they ran and discharged flights of arrows at the\nenemy, who, more heavily armed and weighted, gained but slowly upon them.\n\nHad not Sir Rudolph been stunned by the blow dealt him by Cuthbert, he\nwould himself have headed the pursuit, and in that case the foresters\nwould have had to fight hard to make their retreat to their fastness. The\nofficer in command of the mercenaries, however, had no great stomach for\nthe matter. Men were hard to get, and Prince John would not have been\npleased to hear that a number of the men whom he had brought with such\nexpense from foreign parts had been killed in a petty fray. Therefore\nafter following for a short time he called them off, and the archers fell\nback into the forest.\n\nHere they found Dame Editha, and for three days she abode among them,\nliving in a small hut in the centre of the forest. Then she left, to take\nup her abode, until the troubles were past, with some kin who lived in\nthe south of Gloucestershire.\n\nAlthough the lady abbess had assured Cuthbert that the retreat of Lady\nMargaret was not likely to be found out, he himself, knowing how great a\nstake Sir Rudolph had in the matter, was still far from being easy. It\nwould not be difficult for the latter to learn through his agents that\nthe lady superior of the little convent near Hereford was of kin to her\nof St. Anne's, and, close as a convent is, yet the gossiping of the\nservants who go to market was certain to let out an affair so important\nas the arrival of a young lady to reside under the charge of the\nsuperior. Cuthbert was not mistaken as to the acuteness of his enemy. The\nrelationship between the two lady superiors was no secret, and after\nhaving searched all the farmhouses and granges near the forest, and being\nconvinced that the lady abbess would have sent her charge rather to a\nreligious house than to that of a franklin, Sir Rudolph sought which of\nthose within the circuit of a few miles would be likely to be the one\nselected. It was not long before he was enabled to fix upon that near\nHereford, and spies going to the spot soon found out from the\ncountrypeople that it was a matter of talk that a young lady of rank had\nbeen admitted by the superior. Sir Rudolph hesitated whether to go\nhimself at the head of a strong body of men and openly to take her, or to\nemploy some sort of device. It was not that he himself feared the\nanathema of the church; but he knew Prince John to be weak and\nvacillating, at one time ready to defy the thunder of the pope, the next\ncringing before the spiritual authority. He therefore determined to\nemploy some of his men to burst into the convent and carry off the\nheiress, arranging that he himself, with some of his men-at-arms, should\ncome upon them in the road, and make a feigned rescue of her, so that, if\nthe lady superior laid her complaint before the pope's legate, he could\ndeny that he had any hand in the matter, and could even take credit for\nhaving rescued her from the men who had profaned the convent. That his\nstory would be believed mattered but little. It would be impossible to\nprove its falsity, and this was all that he cared for.\n\nThis course was followed out. Late one evening, the lady superior was\nalarmed by a violent knocking at the door. In reply to questions asked\nthrough the grill, the answer was given, \"We are men of the forest, and\nwe are come to carry the Lady Margaret of Evesham off to a secure\nhiding-place. The lord of Evesham has discovered her whereabouts, and\nwill be here shortly, and we would fain remove her before he arrives.\"\n\n\"From whom have you warrant?\" the lady superior said. \"I surrender her to\nno one, save to the lady abbess of St. Anne's. But if you have a written\nwarrant from Sir Cuthbert, the rightful lord of Evesham, I will lay the\nmatter before the Lady Margaret, and will act as it may seem fit to her.\"\n\n\"We have no time for parleying,\" a rough voice said. \"Throw open the gate\nat once, or we will break it down.\"\n\n\"Ye be no outlaws,\" the lady superior said, \"for the outlaws are men who\nfear God and respect the church. Were ye what ye say, ye would be\nprovided with the warrants that I mention. I warn you, therefore, that if\nyou use force, you will be excommunicated, and placed under the ban of\nthe church.\"\n\nThe only answer was a thundering assault upon the gate, which soon\nyielded to the blows. The sisters and novices ran shrieking through the\ncorridors at this rude uproar. The lady superior, however, stood calmly\nawaiting the giving way of the gate.\n\n\"Where is the Lady Margaret?\" the leader of the party, who were dressed\nin rough garb, and had the seeming of a band of outlaws, demanded.\n\n\"I will say nothing,\" she said, \"nor do I own that she is here.\"\n\n\"We will soon take means to find out,\" the man exclaimed. \"Unless in five\nminutes she is delivered to us, we will burn your place to the ground.\"\n\nThe lady abbess was insensible to the threat; but the men rushing in,\nseized some sisters, who, terrified out of their wits by this irruption,\nat once gave the information demanded, and the men made their way to the\ncell where the Lady Margaret slept.\n\nThe girl had at once risen when the tumult commenced, doubting not in her\nmind that this was another attempt upon the part of her enemy to carry\nher off. When, therefore, she heard heavy footsteps approaching along the\ngallery--having already hastily attired herself--she opened the door and\npresented herself.\n\n\"If you seek the Lady Margaret of Evesham,\" she said calmly, \"I am she.\nDo not harm any of the sisters here. I am in your power, and will go with\nyou at once. But I beseech you add not to your other sins that of\nviolence against holy women.\"\n\nThe men, abashed by the calm dignity of this young girl, abstained from\nlaying hands upon her, but merely motioned to her to accompany them. Upon\ntheir way they met the man who appeared to be their leader, and he, well\npleased that the affair was over, led the way to the courtyard.\n\n\"Farewell, my child,\" the abbess exclaimed. \"God will deliver you from\nthe power of these wicked men. Trust in Him, and keep up your courage.\nWickedness will not be permitted to triumph upon the earth; and be\nassured that the matter shall be brought to the ears of the pope's\nlegate, and of Prince John himself.\"\n\nShe could say no more, for the men closing round the weeping girl,\nhurried her out from the convent. A litter awaited them without, and in\nthis the young lady was placed, and, borne upon the shoulders of four\nstout men, she started at a fast pace, surrounded closely by the rest\nof the band.\n\nIt was a dark night, and the girl could not see the direction in which\nshe was being taken; but she judged from the turn taken upon leaving the\nconvent, that it was towards Evesham. They had proceeded some miles, when\na trampling of horses was heard, and a body of armed men rode up. For a\nmoment Lady Margaret's heart gave a leap, for she thought that she had\nbeen rescued by her friends. There was a loud and angry altercation, a\nclashing of swords, and a sound of shouting and cries outside the litter.\nThen it was placed roughly on the ground, and she heard the sound of the\nfootsteps of her first captors hurrying away. Then the horsemen closed\nround the litter, and the leader dismounted.\n\n\"I am happy indeed, Lady Margaret,\" he said approaching the litter, \"to\nhave been able to save you from the power of these villains. Fortunately,\nword came to me that the outlaws in the forest were about to carry you\noff, and that they would not hesitate even to desecrate the walls of the\nconvent. Assembling my men-at-arms, I at once rode to your rescue, and am\ndoubly happy to have saved you, first, as a gentleman, secondly, as being\nthe man to whom our gracious prince has assigned you as a wife. I am Sir\nRudolph, Earl of Evesham.\"\n\nAs from the first the girl had been convinced that she had fallen into\nthe power of her lawless suitor, this came upon her as no surprise.\n\n\"Whether your story is true, Sir Rudolph,\" she said, \"or not, God knows,\nand I, a poor weak girl, will not pretend to venture to say. It is\nbetween you and your conscience. If, as you say, you have saved me from\nthe power of the outlaws, I demand that, as a knight and a gentleman, you\nreturn with me at once to the convent from which I was taken by force.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that,\" Sir Rudolph said. \"Fortune has placed you in my\nhands, and has enabled me to carry out the commands of the prince.\nTherefore, though I would fain yield to your wishes and so earn your\ngoodwill, which above all things I wish to obtain, yet my duty towards\nthe prince commands me to utilize the advantage which fate has thrown in\nmy hands.\"\n\n\"You must do as you will, Sir Rudolph,\" the girl said with dignity. \"I\nbelieve not your tale. You sought before, in person, to carry me off, but\nfailed, and you have now employed other means to do so. The tale of your\nconduct to Dame Editha has reached my ears, and I hold you a foresworn\nknight and a dishonoured man, and as such I would rather die than become\nyour wife, although as yet I am but a child, and have no need to talk of\nweddings for years to come.\"\n\n\"We need not parley here,\" the knight said coldly. \"We shall have plenty\nof time when at my castle.\"\n\nThe litter was now lifted, placed between two horses, and proceeded\nrapidly on its journey. Although the hope was but faint, yet until the\ngates of the castle closed upon them the Lady Margaret still hoped that\nrescue might reach her. But the secret had been too well kept, and it was\nnot until the following day that the man who had been placed in a cottage\nnear the convent arrived in all haste in the forest, to say that it was\nonly in the morning that he had learnt that the convent had been broken\nopen by men disguised as archers, and the Lady Margaret carried off.\n\nFour days elapsed before Sir Rudolph presented himself before the girl\nhe had captured. So fearfully was his face bruised and disfigured by the\nblow from the mailed hand of Cuthbert three weeks before, that he did not\nwish to appear before her under such unfavourable circumstances, and the\ncaptive passed the day gazing from her casement in one of the rooms in\nthe upper part of the keep, towards the forest whence she hoped rescue\nwould come.\n\nWithin the forest hot discussions were going on as to the best course\nto pursue. An open attack was out of the question, especially as upon\nthe day following the arrival there of Lady Margaret, 300 more\nmercenaries had marched in from Worcester, so that the garrison was now\nraised to 500 men.\n\n\"Is there no way,\" Cnut exclaimed furiously, \"by which we might creep\ninto this den, since we cannot burst into it openly?\"\n\n\"There is a way from the castle,\" Cuthbert said, \"for my dear lord told\nme of it one day when we were riding together in the Holy Land. He said\nthen that it might be that he should never return, and that it were well\nthat I should know of the existence of this passage, which few beside the\nearl himself knew of. It is approached by a very heavy slab of stone in\nthe great hall. This is bolted down, and as it stands under the great\ntable passes unnoticed, and appears part of the ordinary floor. He told\nme the method in which, by touching a spring, the bolts were withdrawn\nand the stone could be raised. Thence a passage a quarter of a mile long\nleads to the little chapel standing in the hollow, and which, being\nhidden among the trees, would be unobserved by any party besieging the\ncastle. This of course was contrived in order that the garrison, or any\nmessenger thereof, might make an exit in case of siege.\"\n\n\"But if we could escape,\" Cnut asked, \"why not enter by this way?\"\n\n\"The stone is of immense weight and strength,\" Cuthbert replied, \"and\ncould not be loosed from below save with great labour and noise. There\nare, moreover, several massive doors in the passage, all of which are\nsecured by heavy bolts within. It is therefore out of the question that\nwe could enter the castle by that way. But were we once in, we could\neasily carry off the lady through this passage.\"\n\nThe large force which Sir Rudolph had collected was not intended merely\nfor the defence of the castle, for the knight considered that with his\nown garrison he could hold it against a force tenfold that which his\nrival could collect. But he was determined if possible to crush out the\noutlaws of the forest, for he felt that so long as this formidable body\nremained under an enterprising leader like Sir Cuthbert, he would never\nbe safe for a moment, and would be a prisoner in his own castle.\n\nCuthbert had foreseen that the attack was likely to be made and had\nstrengthened his band to the utmost. He felt, however, that against so\nlarge a force of regularly armed men, although he might oppose a stout\nresistance and kill many, yet that in the end he must be conquered. Cnut,\nhowever, suggested to him a happy idea, which he eagerly grasped.\n\n\"It would be rare sport,\" Cnut said, \"when this armed force comes out\nto attack us, if we could turn the tables by slipping in, and taking\ntheir castle.\"\n\n\"The very thing,\" Cuthbert exclaimed. \"It is likely that he will use the\ngreater portion of his forces, and that he will not keep above fifty or\nsixty men, at the outside, in the castle. When they sally out we will at\nfirst oppose a stout resistance to them in the wood, gradually falling\nback. Then, at a given signal, all save twenty men shall retire hastily,\nand sweeping round, make for the castle. Their absence will not be\nnoticed, for in this thick wood it is difficult to tell whether twenty\nmen or two hundred are opposing you among the bushes; and the twenty who\nremain must shoot thick and fast to make believe that their numbers are\ngreat, retiring sometimes, and leading the enemy on into the heart of\nthe wood.\"\n\n\"But supposing, Sir Cuthbert, that they should have closed the gates and\nlifted the drawbridge? We could not gain entrance by storming, even if\nonly twenty men held the walls, until long after the main body would have\nreturned.\"\n\nCuthbert thought for some time, and then said, \"Cnut, you shall\nundertake this enterprise. You shall fill a cart high with faggots, and\nin it shall conceal a dozen of your best men. You, dressed as a serf,\nshall drive the oxen, and when you reach the castle shall say, in answer\nto the hail of the sentry, that you are bringing in the tribute of wood\nof your master the franklin of Hopeburn. They will then lower the\ndrawbridge and open the gates; and when you have crossed the bridge and\nare under the portcullis, spring out suddenly, cut loose the oxen so\nthat they will not draw the cart further in, cut the chains of the\ndrawbridge so that it cannot be drawn off, and hold the gate for a\nminute or two until we arrive.\"\n\n\"The plan is capital,\" Cnut exclaimed. \"We will do the proud Norman yet.\nHow he will storm when he finds us masters of his castle. What then will\nyou do, Sir Cuthbert?\"\n\n\"We can hold the castle for weeks,\" Cuthbert said, \"and every day is in\nour favour. If we find ourselves forced to yield to superior numbers, we\ncan at last retire through the passage I have spoken of, and must then\nscatter and each shift for himself until these bad days be past.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV THE SIEGE OF EVESHAM CASTLE.\n\n\nUpon the day before starting out to head the expedition against the\noutlaws, Sir Rudolph sent word to the Lady Margaret that she must prepare\nto become his wife at the end of the week. He had provided two tiring\nmaids for her by ordering two of the franklins to send in their daughters\nfor that purpose, and these mingled their tears with Margaret's at the\nsituation in which they were placed. She replied firmly to the messenger\nof the knight that no power on earth could oblige her to marry him. He\nmight drive her to the altar; but though he killed her there, her lips\nshould refuse to say the words which would unite them.\n\nThe following morning, early, the castle rang with the din of\npreparation. The great portion of the mercenaries were encamped in tents\noutside the walls, for, spacious as it was, Evesham could hardly contain\n400 men in addition to its usual garrison. The men-at-arms were provided\nwith heavy axes to cut their way through the bushes. Some carried bundles\nof straw, to fire the wood should it be found practicable to do so; and\nas it was now summer and the wind was blowing high, Sir Rudolph hoped\nthat the dry grass and bushes would catch, and would do more even than\nhis men-at-arms in clearing the forest of those whom he designated the\nvillains infesting it. They had, too, with them several fierce dogs\ntrained to hunting the deer, and these, the knight hoped, would do good\nservice in tracking the outlaws. He and the knights and the men-at-arms\nwith him were all dismounted, for he felt that horses would in the\nforest be an encumbrance, and he was determined himself to lead the way\nto the men-at-arms.\n\nWhen they reached the forest, they were saluted by a shower of arrows;\nbut as all were clad in mail, these at a distance effected but little\nharm. As they came closer, however, the clothyard arrows began to pierce\nthe coarse and ill-made armour of the foot soldiers, although the finer\narmour of the knight kept out the shafts which struck against it. Sir\nRudolph and his knights leading the way, they entered the forest, and\ngradually pressed their invisible foe backwards through the trees. The\ndogs did good service, going on ahead and attacking the archers; but, one\nby one, they were soon shot, and the assailants left to their own\ndevices. Several attempts were made to fire the wood. But these failed,\nthe fire burning but a short time and then dying out of itself. In\naddition to the fighting men, Sir Rudolph had impressed into the service\nall the serfs of his domain, and these, armed with axes, were directed to\ncut down the trees as the force proceeded, Sir Rudolph declaring that he\nwould not cease until he had levelled the whole forest, though it might\ntake him months to do so.\n\nThe assailants gained ground steadily, the resistance being less severe\nthan Sir Rudolph had anticipated. Several small huts and clearings in the\nforest which had been used by the outlaws, and round which small crops\nhad been planted, were destroyed, and all seemed to promise well for the\nsuccess of the enterprise.\n\nIt was about two hours after they had left the castle, when a heavy cart\nfilled with faggots was seen approaching its gates. The garrison, who had\nnot the least fear of any attack, paid no attention to it until it\nreached the edge of the moat. Then the warder, seeing that it contained\nfaggots, lowered the drawbridge without question, raised the portcullis,\nand opened the gates.\n\n\"From whom do you bring this wood?\" he asked, as the man driving the oxen\nbegan to cross the bridge.\n\n\"From the franklin of Hopeburn.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said the warder, \"for he is in arrear now, and should have\nsent in the firewood two months since. Take it to the wood-house at the\nother end of the court.\"\n\nThe heavy-waggon crossed the drawbridge, but as it was entering the gate\nit came suddenly to a stop. With a blow of his ox goad Cnut levelled the\nwarder to the ground, and cutting the cords of the bullocks, drove them\ninto the yard ahead. As he did so the pile of faggots fell asunder, and\ntwelve men armed with bow and pike leaped out. The men-at-arms standing\nnear, lounging in the courtyard, gave a shout of alarm, and the garrison,\nsurprised at this sudden cry, ran to their arms. At first they were\ncompletely panic-stricken. But seeing after a time how small was the\nnumber of their assailants, they took heart and advanced against them.\nThe passage was narrow, and the twelve men formed a wall across it. Six\nof them with their pikes advanced, the other six with bent bows standing\nbehind them and delivering their arrows between their heads. The garrison\nfought stoutly, and although losing many, were pressing the little band\nbackwards. In vain the assistant-warder tried to lower the portcullis, or\nto close the gates. The former fell on to the top of the waggon, and was\nthere retained. The gates also were barred by the obstacle. The chains of\nthe drawbridge had at once been cut. Cnut encouraged his followers by his\nshouts, and armed with a heavy axe, did good service upon the assailants.\nBut four of his party had fallen, and the rest were giving way, when a\nshout was heard, and over the drawbridge poured Cuthbert and 150 of the\noutlaws of the forest. Struck with terror at this attack, the garrison\ndrew back, and the foresters poured into the yard. For a few minutes\nthere was a fierce fight; but the defenders of the castle, disheartened\nand taken by surprise, were either cut down or, throwing down their arms,\ncried for quarter.\n\nTen minutes after the waggon had crossed the drawbridge, the castle was\nsafely in possession of Sir Cuthbert. The bridge was raised, the waggon\nremoved, the portcullis lowered, and to the external eye all remained\nas before.\n\nCuthbert at once made his way to the chamber where the Lady Margaret was\nconfined, and her joy at her deliverance was great indeed. So unlimited\nwas her faith in Sir Cuthbert that she had never lost confidence; and\nalthough it did not seem possible that in the face of such disparity of\nnumbers he could rescue her from the power of Sir Rudolph, yet she had\nnot given up hope. The joy of the farmers' daughters who had been\ncarried off to act as her attendants was little inferior to her own; for\nonce in the power of this reckless baron, the girls had small hopes of\never being allowed to return again to their parents.\n\nThe flag of Sir Rudolph was thrown down from the keep, and that of the\nlate earl hoisted in its stead; for Cuthbert himself, although he had\nassumed the cognizance which King Richard had granted him, had not yet\nany flag or pennon emblazoned with it.\n\nNo words can portray the stupefaction and rage of Sir Rudolph when a man\nwho had managed to slip unobserved from the castle at the time of its\ncapture, bore the news to him in the forest. All opposition there had\nceased, and the whole of the troops were engaged in aiding the peasants\nin cutting wide roads through the trees across the forest, so as to make\nit penetrable by horsemen in every direction. It was supposed that the\noutlaws had gradually stolen away through the thickets and taken to the\nopen country, intending to scatter to their homes, or other distant\nhiding-places; and the news that they had by a ruse captured the castle,\ncame as a thunderclap.\n\nSir Rudolph's first impulse was to call his men together and to march\ntowards the castle. The drawbridge was up, and the walls bristled with\narmed men. It was useless to attempt a parley; still more useless to\nthink of attacking the stronghold without the proper machines and\nappliances. Foaming with rage, Sir Rudolph took possession of a cottage\nnear, camped his men around and prepared for a siege.\n\nThere were among the mercenaries many men accustomed to the use of\nengines of war. Many, too, had aided in making them; and these were at\nonce set to work to construct the various machines in use at that time.\nBefore the invention of gunpowder, castles such as those of the English\nbarons were able to defy any attack by an armed force for a long period.\nTheir walls were so thick that even the balistas, casting huge stones,\nwere unable to breach them except after a very long time. The moats\nwhich surrounded them were wide and deep, and any attempt at storming by\nladders was therefore extremely difficult; and these buildings were\nconsequently more often captured by famine than by other means. Of\nprovisions, as Sir Rudolph knew, there was a considerable supply at\npresent in the castle, for he had collected a large number of bullocks in\norder to feed the strong body who had been added to the garrison. The\ngranaries, too, were well stored; and with a groan Sir Rudolph thought of\nthe rich stores of French wines which he had collected in his cellars.\n\nAfter much deliberation with the knights with him and the captain of the\nmercenaries, it was agreed in the first instance to attempt to attack the\nplace by filling up a portion of the moat and ascending by scaling\nladders. Huge screens of wood were made, and these were placed on\nwaggons; the waggons themselves were filled with bags of earth, and a\nlarge number of men getting beneath them shoved the ponderous machines\nforward to the edge of the moat. The bags of stones and earth were then\nthrown in, and the waggons pushed backwards to obtain a fresh supply.\nThis operation was of course an exceedingly slow one, a whole day being\noccupied with each trip of the waggons. They were not unmolested in their\nadvance, for, from the walls, mangonels and other machines hurled great\nstones down upon the wooden screens, succeeding sometimes, in spite of\ntheir thickness, in crashing through them, killing many of the men\nbeneath. The experiment was also tried of throwing balls of Greek fire\ndown upon the wood; but as this was green and freshly felled it would not\ntake fire, but the flames dropping through, with much boiling pitch and\nother materials, did grievously burn and scald the soldiers working below\nit. Upon both sides every device was tried. The cross-bow men among the\nmercenaries kept up a fire upon the walls to hinder the defenders from\ninterfering with the operations, while the archers above shot steadily,\nand killed many of those who ventured within range of their bows.\n\nAfter ten days' labour, a portion of the moat some twenty yards in\nlength was filled with bags of earth, and all was ready for the assault.\nThe besiegers had prepared great numbers of strong ladders, and these\nwere brought up under shelter of the screens. Then, all being ready, the\ntrumpets sounded for the assault, and the troops moved forward in a close\nbody, covering themselves with their shields so that no man's head or\nbody was visible, each protecting the one before him with his shield held\nover him. Thus the body presented the appearance of a great scale-covered\nanimal. In many respects, indeed, the warfare of those days was changed\nin no way from that of the time of the Romans. In the 1200 years which\nhad elapsed between the siege of Jerusalem and the days of the crusades\nthere had been but little change in arms or armour, and the operations\nwhich Titus undertook for the reduction of the Jewish stronghold differed\nbut little from those which a Norman baron employed in besieging his\nneighbour's castle.\n\nWithin Evesham Castle all was contentment and merriment during these\ndays. The garrison had no fear whatever of being unable to repel the\nassault when it should be delivered. Huge stones had been collected in\nnumbers on the walls, cauldrons of pitch, beneath which fires kept\nsimmering, stood there in readiness. Long poles with hooks with which to\nseize the ladders and cut them down were laid there; and all that\nprecaution and science could do was prepared.\n\nCuthbert passed much of the day, when not required upon the walls,\nchatting with the Lady Margaret, who, attended by her maidens, sat\nworking in her bower. She had learnt to read from the good nuns of the\nconvent--an accomplishment which was by no means general, even among the\ndaughters of nobles; but books were rare, and Evesham boasted but few\nmanuscripts. Here Margaret learnt in full all the details of Cuthbert's\nadventures since leaving England, and the fondness with which as a child\nshe had regarded the lad grew gradually into the affection of a woman.\n\nThe courage of the garrison was high, for although they believed that\nsooner or later the castle might be carried by the besiegers, they had\nalready been told by Cnut that there was a means of egress unknown to the\nbesiegers, and that when the time came they would be able to escape\nunharmed. This, while it in no way detracted from their determination to\ndefend the castle to the last, yet rendered their task a far lighter and\nmore agreeable one than it would have been had they seen the gallows\nstanding before them as the end of the siege. As the testudo, as it was\ncalled in those days, advanced towards the castle, the machines upon the\nwalls--catapults, mangonels, and arbalasts--poured forth showers of\nstones and darts upon it, breaking up the array of shields and killing\nmany; and as these openings were made, the archers, seizing their time,\npoured in volleys of arrows. The mercenaries, however, accustomed to war,\nadvanced steadily, and made good their footing beneath the castle wall,\nand proceeded to rear their ladders. Here, although free from the action\nof the machines, they were exposed to the hand missiles, which were\nscarcely less destructive. In good order, and with firmness, however,\nthey reared the ladders, and mounted to the assault, covering themselves\nas well as they could with their shields. In vain, however, did they\nmount. The defenders poured down showers of boiling pitch and oil, which\npenetrated the crevices of their armour, and caused intolerable torment.\nGreat stones were toppled over from the battlements upon them; and\nsometimes the ladders, seized by the poles with hooks, were cast\nbackwards, with all upon them, on the throng below. For half-an-hour,\nencouraged by the shouts of Sir Rudolph and their leaders, the soldiers\nstrove gallantly; but were at last compelled to draw off, having lost\nnigh 100 men, without one gaining a footing upon the walls.\n\nThat evening another council of war was held without. Already some large\nmachines for which Sir Rudolph had sent had arrived. In anticipation of\nthe possibility of failure, two castles upon wheels had been prepared,\nand between these a huge beam with an iron head was hung. This was upon\nthe following day pushed forward on the newly-formed ground across the\nmoat. Upon the upper part of each tower were armed men who worked\nmachines casting sheaves of arrows and other missiles. Below were those\nwho worked the ram. To each side of the beam were attached numerous\ncords, and with these it was swung backwards and forwards, giving heavy\nblows each stroke upon the wall. The machines for casting stones, which\nhad arrived, were also brought in play, and day and night these\nthundered against the walls; while the ram repeated its ceaseless blows\nupon the same spot, until the stone crumbled before it.\n\nVery valiantly did the garrison oppose themselves to these efforts. But\neach day showed the progress made by the besiegers. Their forces had been\nincreased, Prince John having ordered his captain at Gloucester to send\nanother 100 men to the assistance of Sir Rudolph. Other towers had now\nbeen prepared. These were larger than the first, and overtopped the\ncastle walls. From the upper story were drawbridges, so formed as to drop\nfrom the structures upon the walls, and thus enable the besiegers to rush\nupon them. The process was facilitated by the fact that the battlements\nhad been shot away by the great stones, and there was a clear space on\nwhich the drawbridges could fall. The attack was made with great vigour;\nbut for a long time the besieged maintained their post, and drove back\nthe assailants as they poured out across the drawbridges on to the wall.\nAt last Cuthbert saw that the forces opposed to him were too numerous to\nbe resisted, and gave orders to his men to fall back upon the inner keep.\n\nMaking one rush, and clearing the wall of those who had gained a footing,\nthe garrison fell back hastily, and were safely within the massive keep\nbefore the enemy had mustered in sufficient numbers upon the wall to\ninterfere with them. The drawbridge was now lowered, and the whole of the\nassailants gained footing within the castle. They were still far from\nhaving achieved a victory. The walls of the keep were massive and strong,\nand its top far higher than the walls, so that from above a storm of\narrows poured down upon all who ventured to show themselves. The keep had\nno windows low enough down for access to be gained; and those on the\nfloors above were so narrow, and protected by bars, that it seemed by\nscaling the walls alone could an entry be effected. This was far too\ndesperate an enterprise to be attempted, for the keep rose eighty feet\nabove the courtyard. It was upon the door, solid and studded with iron,\nthat the attempt had to be made.\n\nSeveral efforts were made by Sir Rudolph, who fought with a bravery\nworthy of a better cause, to assault and batter down the door. Protected\nby wooden shields from the rain of missiles from above, he and his\nknights hacked at the door with their battle-axes. But in vain. It had\nbeen strengthened by beams behind, and by stones piled up against it.\nThen fire was tried. Faggots were collected in the forest, and brought;\nand a huge pile having been heaped against the door, it was lighted. \"We\ncould doubtless prolong the siege for some days, Lady Margaret,\" said\nCuthbert, \"but the castle is ours; and we wish not, when the time comes\nthat we shall again be masters of it, that it should be a mere heap of\nruins. Methinks we have done enough. With but small losses on our side,\nwe have killed great numbers of the enemy, and have held them at bay for\na month. Therefore, I think that tonight it will be well for us to leave\nthe place.\"\n\nLady Margaret was rejoiced at the news that the time for escape had come,\nfor the perpetual clash of war, the rattling of arrows, the ponderous\nthud of heavy stones, caused a din very alarming to a young girl; and\nalthough the room in which she sat, looking into the inner court of the\ncastle, was not exposed to missiles, she trembled at the thought that\nbrave men were being killed, and that at any moment a shot might strike\nCuthbert, and so leave her without a friend or protector.\n\nContent with having destroyed the door, the assailants made no further\neffort that evening, but prepared in the morning to attack it, pull\ndown the stones filled behind it, and force their way into the keep.\nThere was, with the exception of the main entrance, but one means of\nexit, a small postern door behind the castle, and throughout the siege\na strong body of troops had been posted here, to prevent the garrison\nmaking a sortie.\n\nFeeling secure therefore that upon the following day his enemies would\nfall into his power, Sir Rudolph retired to rest.\n\nAn hour before midnight the garrison assembled in the hall. The table was\nremoved, and Cuthbert having pressed the spring, which was at a distance\nfrom the stone and could not be discovered without a knowledge of its\nexistence, the stone turned aside by means of a counterpoise, and a\nflight of steps was seen. Torches had been prepared. Cnut and a chosen\nband went first; Cuthbert followed, with Lady Margaret and her\nattendants; and the rest of the archers brought up the rear, a trusty man\nbeing left in charge at last with orders to swing back the stone into its\nplace, having first hauled the table over the spot, so that their means\nof escape should be unknown.\n\nThe passage was long and dreary, the walls were damp with wet, and the\nmassive doors so swollen by moisture that it was with the greatest\ndifficulty they could be opened. At last, however, they emerged into the\nlittle friary in the wood. It was deserted, the priest who usually dwelt\nthere having fled when the siege began. The stone which there, as in the\ncastle, concealed the exit, was carefully closed, and the party then\nemerged into the open air. Here Cuthbert bade adieu to his comrades. Cnut\nhad very anxiously begged to be allowed to accompany him and share his\nfortunes, and Cuthbert had promised him that if at any time he should\nagain take up arms in England, he would summon him to his side, but that\nat present as he knew not whither his steps would be turned, it would be\nbetter that he should be unattended. The archers had all agreed to\nscatter far and wide through the country, many of them proceeding to\nNottingham and joining the bands in the forest of Sherwood.\n\nCuthbert himself had determined to make his way to the castle of his\nfriend, Sir Baldwin, and to leave the Lady Margaret in his charge. Cnut\nhurried on at full speed to the house of a franklin, some three miles\ndistant. Here horses were obtained and saddled, and dresses prepared; and\nwhen Cuthbert with Lady Margaret arrived there, no time was lost. Dressed\nas a yeoman, with the Lady Margaret as his sister, he mounted a horse,\nwith her behind him on a pillion. The other damsels also mounted, as it\nwould not have been safe for them to remain near Evesham. They therefore\npurposed taking refuge in a convent near Gloucester for the present.\nBidding a hearty adieu to Cnut, and with thanks to the franklin who had\naided them, they set forward on their journey. By morning they had\nreached the convent, and here the two girls were left, and Cuthbert\ncontinued his journey. He left his charge at a convent a day's ride\ndistant from the castle of Sir Baldwin, as he wished to consult the\nknight first as to the best way of her entering the castle without\nexciting talk or suspicion.\n\nSir Baldwin received him with joy. He had heard something of his doings,\nand the news of the siege of Evesham had been noised abroad. He told him\nthat he was in communication with many other barons, and that ere long\nthey hoped to rise against the tyranny of Prince John, but that at\npresent they were powerless, as many, hoping that King Richard would\nreturn ere long, shrank from involving the country in a civil war. When\nCuthbert told him that the daughter of his old friend was at a convent\nbut a day's ride distant, and that he sought protection for her, Sir\nBaldwin instantly offered her hospitality.\n\n\"I will,\" he said, \"send my good wife to fetch her. Some here know your\npresence, and it would be better therefore that she did not arrive for\nsome days, as her coming will then seem to be unconnected with yourself.\nMy wife and I will, a week hence, give out that we are going to fetch a\ncousin of my wife's to stay here with her; and when we return no\nsuspicion will be excited that she is other than she seems. Should it be\notherwise, I need not say that Sir Baldwin of Bthune will defend his\ncastle against any of the minions of Prince John. But I have no fear that\nher presence here will be discovered. What think you of doing in the\nmeantime?\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" Cuthbert said, \"of going east. No news has been obtained\nof our lord the king save that he is a prisoner in the hands of the\nemperor; but where confined, or how, we know not. It is my intent to\ntravel to the Tyrol, and to trace his steps from the time that he was\ncaptured. Then, when I obtain knowledge of the place where he is kept, I\nwill return, and consult upon the best steps to be taken. My presence in\nEngland is now useless. Did the barons raise the standard of King Richard\nagainst the prince, I should at once return and join them. But without\nland or vassals, I can do nothing here, and shall be indeed like a hunted\nhare, for I know that the false earl will move heaven and earth to\ncapture me.\"\n\nSir Baldwin approved of the resolution; but recommended Cuthbert to take\nevery precaution not to fall himself into the hands of the emperor;\n\"for,\" he said, \"if we cannot discover the prison of King Richard, I fear\nthat it would be hopeless indeed ever to attempt to find that in which a\nsimple knight is confined.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. IN SEARCH OF THE KING.\n\n\nThe following day, with many thanks Cuthbert started from the castle, and\nin the first place visited the convent, and told Lady Margaret that she\nwould be fetched in a few days by Sir Baldwin and his wife. He took a\ntender adieu of her, not without many forebodings and tears upon her\npart; but promising blithely that he would return and lead her back in\ntriumph to her castle, he bade adieu and rode for London.\n\nHe had attired himself as a merchant, and took up his abode at a hostelry\nnear Cheapside. Here he remained quietly for some days, and, mixing among\nthe people, learnt that in London as elsewhere the rapacity of Prince\nJohn had rendered him hateful to the people, and that they would gladly\nembrace any opportunity of freeing themselves from his yoke. He was\npreparing to leave for France, when the news came to him that Prince John\nhad summoned all the barons faithful to him to meet him near London, and\nhad recalled all his mercenaries from different parts of the country, and\nwas gathering a large army; also, that the barons faithful to King\nRichard, alarmed by the prospect, had raised the royal standard, and that\ntrue men were hurrying to their support. This entirely destroyed the\nplans that he had formed. Taking horse again, and avoiding the main road,\nby which he might meet the hostile barons on their way to London, he\njourneyed down to Nottingham. Thence riding boldly into the forest, he\nsought the outlaws, and was not long ere he found them. At his request he\nwas at once taken before their leader, a man of great renown both for\ncourage and bowmanship, one Robin Hood. This bold outlaw had long held at\ndefiance the Sheriff of Nottingham, and had routed him and all bodies of\ntroops who had been sent against him. With him Cuthbert found many of his\nown men; and upon hearing that the royal standard had been raised, Robin\nHood at once agreed to march with all his men to join the royal force.\nMessengers were despatched to summon the rest of the forest band from\ntheir hiding places, and a week later Cuthbert, accompanied by Robin Hood\nand 300 archers, set out for the rendezvous. When they arrived there they\nfound that Sir Baldwin had already joined with his retainers, and was by\nhim most warmly received, and introduced to the other barons in the camp,\nby whom Cuthbert was welcomed as a brother. The news that Prince John's\narmy was approaching was brought in, a fortnight after Cuthbert had\njoined the camp, and the army in good order moved out to meet the enemy.\n\nThe forces were about equal. The battle began by a discharge of arrows;\nbut Robin Hood and his men shot so true and fast that they greatly\ndiscomfited the enemy; and King John's mercenaries having but little\nstomach for the fight, and knowing how unpopular they were in England,\nand that if defeated small mercy was likely to be shown to them, refused\nto advance against the ranks of the loyal barons, and falling back\ndeclined to join in the fray. Seeing their numbers so weakened by this\ndefection, the barons on the prince's side hesitated, and surrounding the\nprince advised him to make terms with the barons while there was yet\ntime. Prince John saw that the present was not a favourable time for him,\nand concealing his fury under a mask of courtesy, he at once acceded to\nthe advice of his followers, and despatched a messenger to the barons\nwith an inquiry as to what they wanted of him. A council was held, and it\nwas determined to demand the dismissal of the mercenaries and their\ndespatch back to their own country; also that John would govern only as\nhis brother's representative; that the laws of the country should be\nrespected; that no taxes should be raised without the assent of the\nbarons; that all men who had taken up arms against his authority should\nbe held free; and that the barons on Prince John's side should return\npeaceably home and disband their forces. Seeing, under the circumstances,\nthat there was no way before him but to yield to these demands, Prince\nJohn accepted the terms. The mercenaries were ordered to march direct to\nLondon, and orders were given that ships should be at once prepared to\ntake them across to Normandy, and the barons marched for their homes.\n\nSatisfied, now that the mercenaries were gone, that they could\nhenceforth hold their ground against Prince John, the royal barons also\nbroke up their forces. Robin Hood with his foresters returned to\nSherwood; and Cuthbert, bidding adieu to Sir Baldwin, rode back to\nLondon, determined to carry out the plan which he had formed. He was the\nmore strengthened in this resolution, inasmuch as in the royal camp he\nhad met a friend from whom he parted last in the Holy Land. This was\nBlondel, the minstrel of King Richard, whose songs and joyous music had\noften lightened the evening after days of fighting and toil in\nPalestine. To him Cuthbert confided his intention, and the minstrel\ninstantly offered to accompany him.\n\n\"I shall,\" he said, \"be of assistance to you. Minstrels are like heralds.\nThey are of no nationality, and can pass free where a man at arms would\nbe closely watched and hindered. Moreover, it may be that I might aid you\ngreatly in discovering the prison of the king. So great is the secrecy\nwith which this has been surrounded, that I question if any inquiries you\ncould make would enable you to trace him. My voice, however, can\npenetrate into places where we cannot enter. I will take with me my lute,\nand as we journey I will sing outside the walls of each prison we come to\none of the songs which I sang in Palestine. King Richard is himself a\nsinger and knows my songs as well as myself. If I sing a verse of some\nsong which I wrote there and which, therefore, would be known only to\nhim, if he hears it he may follow with the next verse, and so enable us\nto know of his hiding place.\"\n\nCuthbert at once saw the advantages which such companionship would bring\nhim, and joyfully accepted the minstrel's offer, agreeing himself to go\nas serving man to Blondel. The latter accompanied him to London. Here\ntheir preparations were soon made, and taking ship in a merchantman bound\nfor the Netherlands, they started without delay upon their adventure.\n\nThe minstrels and troubadours were at that time a privileged race in\nEurope, belonging generally to the south of France, although produced in\nall lands. They travelled over Europe singing the lays which they\nthemselves had composed, and were treated with all honour at the\ncastles where they chose to alight. It would have been considered as\nfoul a deed to use discourtesy to a minstrel as to insult a herald. Their\npersons were, indeed, regarded as sacred, and the knights and barons\nstrove to gain their good will by hospitality and presents, as a large\nproportion of their ballads related to deeds of war; and while they\nwould write lays in honour of those who courteously entertained them,\nthey did not hesitate to heap obloquy upon those who received them\ndiscourteously, holding them up to the gibes and scoffs of their\nfellows. In no way, therefore, would success be so likely to attend the\nmission of those who set out to discover the hiding place of King\nRichard as under the guise of a minstrel and his attendant. No questions\nwould be asked them; they could halt where they would, in castle or\ntown, secure of hospitality and welcome. Blondel was himself a native of\nthe south of France, singing his songs in the soft language of\nLanguedoc. Cuthbert's Norman French would pass muster anywhere as being\nthat of a native of France; and although when dressed as a servitor\nattention might be attracted by his bearing, his youth might render it\nprobable that he was of noble family, but that he had entered the\nservice of the minstrel in order to qualify himself some day for\nfollowing that career. He carried a long staff, a short sword, and at\nhis back the lute or small harp played upon by the troubadour. Blondel's\nattire was rich, and suitable to a person of high rank.\n\nThey crossed to the Scheldt, and thence travelled by the right bank of\nthe Rhine as far as Mannheim, sometimes journeying by boat, sometimes on\nfoot. They were also hospitably entertained, and were considered to more\nthan repay their hosts by the songs which Blondel sang. At Mannheim they\npurchased two horses, and then struck east for Vienna. The journey was\nnot without danger, for a large portion of this part of Europe was under\nno settled government, each petty baron living in his own castle, and\nholding but slight allegiance to any feudal lord, making war upon his\nneighbour on his own account, levying blackmail from travellers, and\nperpetually at variance with the burghers of the towns. The hills were\ncovered with immense forests, which stretched for many leagues in all\ndirections, and these were infested by wolves, bears, and robbers. The\nlatter, however, although men without pity or religion, yet held the\ntroubadours in high esteem, and the travellers without fear entered the\ngloomy shades of the forest.\n\nThey had not gone far when their way was barred by a number of armed men.\n\n\"I am a minstrel,\" Blondel said, \"and as such doubt not that your\ncourtesy will be extended to me.\"\n\n\"Of a surety,\" the leader said, \"the gay science is as much loved and\nrespected in the greenwood as in the castle; and moreover, the purses of\nthose who follow it are too light to offer any temptation to us. We would\npray you, however, to accompany us to our leader, who will mightily\nrejoice to see you, for he loves music, and will gladly be your host so\nlong as you will stay with him.\"\n\nBlondel, without objection, turned his horse's head and accompanied the\nmen, followed by Cuthbert. After half an hour's travelling, they came to\na building which had formerly been a shrine, but which was now converted\nto the robbers' headquarters. The robber chief on hearing from his\nfollowers the news that a minstrel had arrived, came forward to meet him,\nand courteously bade him welcome.\n\n\"I am Sir Adelbert, of Rotherheim,\" he said, \"although you see me in so\npoor a plight. My castle and lands have been taken by my neighbour, with\nwhom for generations my family have been at feud. I was in the Holy Land\nwith the emperor, and on my return found that the baron had taken the\nopportunity of my absence, storming my castle and seizing my lands. In\nvain I petitioned the emperor to dispossess this traitorous baron of my\nlands, which by all the laws of Christendom should have been respected\nduring my absence. The emperor did indeed send a letter to the baron to\ndeliver them up to me; but his power here is but nominal, and the baron\ncontemptuously threw the royal proclamation into the fire, and told the\nmessenger that what he had taken by the sword he would hold the sword;\nand the emperor, having weightier matters on hand than to set troops in\nmotion to redress the grievances of a simple knight, gave the matter no\nfurther thought. I have therefore been driven to the forest, where I live\nas best I may with my followers, most of whom were retainers upon my\nestate, and some my comrades in the Holy Land. I make war upon the rich\nand powerful, and beyond that do harm to no man. But, methinks,\" he\ncontinued, \"I know your face, gentle sir.\"\n\n\"It may well be so, Sir Adelbert,\" the minstrel said, \"for I too was\nin the Holy Land. I followed the train of King Richard, and mayhap at\nsome of the entertainments given by him you have seen my face. My name\nis Blondel.\"\n\n\"I remember now,\" the knight said. \"It was at Acre that I first saw you,\nand if I remember rightly you can wield the sword as well as the lute.\"\n\n\"One cannot always be playing and singing,\" Blondel said, \"and in lack of\namusement I was forced to do my best against the infidel, who indeed\nwould have but little respected my art had I fallen into his hands. The\nfollowers of the prophet hold minstrels but in slight reverence.\"\n\n\"What is the news of King Richard?\" the knight said. \"I have heard that\nhe was lost on the voyage homewards.\"\n\n\"It is not so,\" Blondel said. \"He landed safely on the coast, and was\njourneying north with a view of joining his sister at the Court of\nSaxony, when he was foully seized and imprisoned by the Archduke John.\"\n\n\"That were gross shame indeed,\" the knight said, \"and black treachery on\nthe part of Duke John. And where is the noble king imprisoned?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Blondel, \"no man knows. On my journey hither I have gathered\nthat the emperor claimed him from the hand of the Archduke, and that he\nis imprisoned in one of the royal fortresses; but which, I know not. And\nindeed, sir knight, since you are well disposed towards him, I may tell\nyou that the purport of my journey is to discover if I can the place of\nhis confinement. He was a kind and noble master, and however long my\nsearch may be, I will yet obtain news of him.\"\n\nThe knight warmly applauded the troubadour's resolution, and was turning\nto lead him into his abode, when his eye fell upon Cuthbert.\n\n\"Methinks I know the face of your attendant as well as your own; though\nwhere I can have seen him I know not. Was he with you in the Holy Land?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Blondel said, \"the youth was also there; and doubtless you may\nhave noticed him, for he is indeed of distinguished and of good family.\"\n\n\"Then let him share our repast,\" the knight said, \"if it seems good to\nyou. In these woods there is no rank, and I myself have long dropped my\nknightly title, and shall not reassume it until I can pay off my score to\nthe Baron of Rotherheim, and take my place again in my castle.\"\n\nThe minstrel and Cuthbert were soon seated at the table with the knight\nand one or two of his principal companions. A huge venison pasty formed\nthe staple of the repast, but hares and other small game were also upon\nthe table. Nor was the generous wine of the country wanting.\n\nThe knight had several times glanced at Cuthbert, and at last exclaimed,\n\"I have it now. This is no attendant, sir minstrel, but that valiant\nyoung knight who so often rode near King Richard in battle. He is, as I\nguess, your companion in this quest; is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is,\" Cuthbert replied frankly. \"I am like yourself, a disinherited\nknight, and my history resembles yours. Upon my return to England I found\nanother in possession of the land and titles that belonged to the noble I\nfollowed, and which King Richard bestowed upon me. The Earl of Evesham\nwas doubtless known to you, and before his death King Richard, at his\nrequest, bestowed upon me as his adopted son--although but a distant\nconnexion--his title and lands and the hand of his daughter. Prince John,\nwho now rules in England, had however granted these things to one of his\nfavourites, and he having taken possession of the land and title, though\nnot, happily, of the lady, closed his door somewhat roughly in my face. I\nfound means, however, to make my mark upon him; but as our quarrel could\nnot be fought out to the end, and as the false knight had the aid of\nPrince John, I am forced for a while to postpone our settlement, and\nmeeting my good friend the minstrel, agreed to join him in his enterprise\nto discover our lord the king.\"\n\nThe knight warmly grasped Cuthbert's hand.\n\n\"I am glad,\" he said, \"to meet so true and valiant a knight. I have often\nwondered at the valour with which you, although so young, bore yourself;\nand there were tales afloat of strange adventures which you had undergone\nin captivity for a time among the infidels.\"\n\nAt Sir Adelbert's request, Cuthbert related the story of his adventures\namong the Saracens; and then Blondel, tuning his lute, sang several\ncanzonets which he had composed in the Holy Land, of feats of arms and\nadventure.\n\n\"How far are you,\" Cuthbert asked presently, when Blondel laid his lute\naside, \"from the estates which were wrongfully wrested from you?\"\n\n\"But twenty leagues,\" the knight said. \"My castle was on the Rhine,\nbetween Coblentz and Mannheim.\"\n\n\"Does the baron know that you are so near?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"Methinks that he does not,\" the knight replied, \"but that he deems me to\nhave gone to the court of the emperor to seek for redress--which, he\nguesses, I shall certainly fail to obtain.\"\n\n\"How many men have you with you?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"Fifty men, all good and true,\" the knight said.\n\n\"Has it never entered your thoughts to attempt a surprise upon his\ncastle?\" Cuthbert said.\n\nThe knight was silent for a minute.\n\n\"At times,\" he said at length, \"thoughts of so doing have occurred to\nme; but the castle is strong, and a surprise would be difficult indeed.\"\n\n\"If the baron is lulled in security at present,\" Cuthbert said, \"and\ndeems you afar off, the watch is likely to be relaxed, and with a sudden\nonslaught you might surely obtain possession. Blondel and myself are not\npressed for time, and the delay of a few days can make but little\ndifference. If, therefore, you think we could be of assistance to you in\nsuch an attempt, my sword, and I am sure that of my friend, would be at\nyour disposal.\"\n\nThe knight sat for some time in silence.\n\n\"Thanks, generous knight,\" he said at last, \"I am sorely tempted to avail\nmyself of your offer; but I fear that the enterprise is hopeless. The\naid, however, of your arm and knowledge of war would greatly add to my\nchances, and if it pleases you we will ride to-morrow to a point where we\ncan obtain a sight of the baron's castle. When you see it, you shall\njudge yourself how far such an enterprise as you propose is possible.\"\n\n\"Is your own castle intact?\" Cuthbert asked.\n\n\"The walls are standing,\" he said; \"but a breach has been made in them,\nand at present it is wholly deserted.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" Cuthbert asked, \"that if you succeeded in surprising and\ndefeating the garrison of the castle that you could then regain your own,\nand hold it against your enemy?\"\n\n\"I think that I could,\" Sir Adelbert said. \"The baron's domains are but\nlittle larger than my own. Many of my retainers still live upon the\nestate, and would; I am sure, gladly join me, if I were to raise my flag.\nThe baron, too, is hated by his neighbours, and could I inflict a\ncrushing blow upon him, methinks it would be so long a time before he\ncould assemble a force, that I might regain my castle and put it in an\nattitude of defence before he could take the field against me.\"\n\n\"If,\" Cuthbert said, \"we could surprise the castle, it might well be that\nthe baron would fall into your hands, and in that case you might be able\nto make your own terms with him. How strong a force is he likely to have\nin his castle?\"\n\n\"Some fifty or sixty men,\" the knight replied; \"for with such a force he\ncould hold the castle against an attack of ten times their number, and he\ncould in twelve hours call in his retainers, and raise the garrison to\n300 or 400 men.\"\n\nBlondel warmly assented to Cuthbert's scheme, and it was settled that at\ndaybreak they should start to view the Castle of Rotherheim. At early\ndawn they were in the saddle, and the three rode all day, until towards\nsunset they stood on the crest of a hill looking down into the valley of\nthe Rhine.\n\nThe present aspect of that valley affords but a slight idea of its beauty\nin those days. The slopes are now clad with vineyards, which, although\npicturesque in idea, are really, to look at from a distance, no better\nthan so many turnip fields. The vines are planted in rows and trained to\nshort sticks, and as these rows follow the declivities of the hillside,\nthey are run in all directions, and the whole mountain side, from the\nriver far up, is cut up into little patches of green lines. In those days\nthe mountains were clad with forests, which descended nearly to the river\nside. Here and there, upon craggy points, were situate the fortalices of\nthe barons. Little villages nestled in the woods, or stood by the river\nbank, and a fairer scene could not be witnessed in Europe.\n\n\"That is Rotherheim,\" the knight said, pointing to a fortress standing on\na crag, which rose high above the woods around it; \"and that,\" he said,\npointing to another some four miles away, similarly placed, \"is my own.\"\n\nCuthbert examined closely the fortress of Rotherheim. It was a large\nbuilding, with towers at the angles, and seemed to rise almost abruptly\nfrom the edge of the rock. Inside rose the gables and round turrets of\nthe dwelling-place of the baron; and the only access was by a steep\nwinding path on the river side.\n\n\"It is indeed a strong place,\" Cuthbert said, \"and difficult to take by\nsurprise. A watch no doubt is always kept over the entrance, and there we\ncan hope for no success. The only plan will be to scale the wall by means\nof a ladder; but how the ladder is to be got to so great a height, I own\nat present passes my comprehension.\" After much thought, Cuthbert went\non, \"It might, methinks, be practicable for an archer to approach the\nwalls, and to shoot an arrow over the angle of the castle so that it\nwould pass inside the turret there, and fall in the forest beyond. If to\nthis arrow were attached a light cord, it could be gained by one on the\nother side, and a stronger cord hauled over. To this could be attached a\nrope ladder, and so this could be raised to the top of the wall. If a\nsentinel were anywhere near he might hear the rope pulled across the\nbattlements; but if as we may hope, a watch is kept only over the\nentrance, the operation might be performed without attracting notice.\"\n\nThe knight was delighted with the project, which seemed perfectly\nfeasible, and it was agreed that the attempt should be made.\n\n\"It will need,\" Sir Adelbert said, \"an archer with a strong arm indeed to\nshoot an arrow with a cord attached to it, however light, over the corner\nof the castle.\"\n\n\"Methinks,\" Cuthbert said, \"that I can do that, for as a lad I was used\nto the strong bows of my country. The first thing, however, will be to\nobtain such a bow; but doubtless one can be purchased in one of the\ntowns, which, if not so strong as those to which I was accustomed, will\nat any rate suffice for us.\"\n\nThe party bivouacked in the woods for the night, for the horses had\nalready done a very long journey, and needed rest before starting back\nfor the Black Forest. At daybreak, however, they started, and at\nnightfall rejoined their band. These were delighted when they heard the\nscheme that had been set on foot, and all avowed their eagerness to join\nin the attempt to restore their lord to his rights.\n\nTwo days later they set out, having already procured from the nearest\ntown a strong bow, some arrows, a very light rope, and a stronger one\nfrom a portion of which they manufactured a rope ladder capable of\nreaching from the top of the wall to the rock below. The journey this\ntime occupied two days, as the men on foot were unable to march at the\npace at which the mounted party had traversed the ground. The evening\nof the second day, however, saw them in sight of the castle. By\nCuthbert's advice, Sir Adelbert determined to give them twenty-four\nhours of rest, in order that they might have their full strength for\nundertaking the task before them. During the day, Cuthbert, guided by\nthe knight, made his way through the woods to the foot of the rocks on\nwhich the castle stood. They were extremely steep, but could be mounted\nby active men if unopposed from above. Cuthbert measured the height\nwith his eye from the top of the castle wall to the place which he\nselected as most fitting from which to shoot the arrow, and announced\nto the knight that he thought there would be no difficulty in\ndischarging an arrow over the angle.\n\nAt nightfall the whole party made their way silently through the woods.\nThree men were sent round to the side of the castle opposite that from\nwhich Cuthbert was to shoot. The length of light string was carefully\ncoiled on the ground, so as to unwind with the greatest facility, and so\noffer as little resistance to the flight of the arrow as might be. Then,\nall being in readiness, Cuthbert attached the end to an arrow, and\ndrawing the bow to its full compass, let fly the arrow. All held their\nbreath; but no sound followed the discharge. They were sure, therefore,\nthat the arrow had not struck the wall, but that it must have passed\nclear over it. Half-an-hour elapsed before they felt that the cord was\npulled, and knew that the men upon the other side had succeeded in\nfinding the arrow and string attached. The stronger cord was now fastened\nto that which the arrow had carried, and this gradually disappeared in\nthe darkness. A party now stole up the rock, and posted themselves at the\nfoot of the castle wall. They took with them the coil of rope-ladder and\nthe end of the rope. At length the rope tightened, and to the end they\nattached the ladder. This again ascended until the end only remained upon\nthe ground, and they knew that it must have reached the top of the wall.\nThey now held fast, and knew that those on the other side, following the\ninstructions given them, would have fastened the rope to a tree upon the\nopposite side. They were now joined by the rest of the party, and Sir\nAdelbert leading the way, and followed by Cuthbert and Blondel, began\ncautiously to ascend the rope ladder.\n\nAll this time no sound from the castle proclaimed that their intention\nwas suspected, or that any alarm had been given, and in silence they\ngained the top of the wall. Here they remained quiet until the whole band\nwere gathered there, and then made their way along until they reached the\nstairs leading to the courtyard. These they descended, and then, raising\nhis war cry, Sir Adelbert sprang upon the men who, round a fire, were\nsitting by the gate. These were cut down before they could leap to their\nfeet, and the party then rushed at the entrance to the dwelling-house.\nThe retainers of the castle, aroused by the sudden din, rushed from their\nsleeping places, but taken completely by surprise, were unable to offer\nany resistance whatever to the strong force which had, as if by magic,\ntaken possession of the castle. The surprise was complete, and with\nscarce a blow struck they found themselves in possession. The baron\nhimself was seized as he rose from his bed, and his rage at finding\nhimself in the power of his enemy was so great as for some time to render\nhim speechless. Sir Adelbert briefly dictated to him the conditions upon\nwhich only he should desist from using his power to hang him over his own\ngate. The baron was instantly to issue orders to all his own retainers\nand tenantry to lend their aid to those of Sir Adelbert in putting the\ncastle of the latter into a state of defence and mending the breach which\nexisted. A sum of money, equal to the revenues of which he had possessed\nhimself, was to be paid at once, and the knight was to retain possession\nof Rotherheim and of the baron's person until these conditions were all\nfaithfully carried out. The baron had no resource but to assent to these\nterms, and upon the following day Cuthbert and Blondel departed upon\ntheir way, overwhelmed with thanks by Sir Adelbert, and confident that he\nwould now be able to regain and hold the possession of his estate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. KING RICHARD'S RETURN TO ENGLAND.\n\n\nJourneying onward, Blondel and his companion stopped at many castles, and\nwere everywhere hospitably entertained. Arriving at Vienna they lingered\nfor some time, hoping there to be able to obtain some information of the\nwhereabouts of King Richard. Blondel in his songs artfully introduced\nallusions to the captive monarch and to the mourning of all Christendom\nat the imprisonment of its champion. These allusions were always well\nreceived, and he found that the great bulk of the nobles of the empire\nwere indignant and ashamed at the conduct of the emperor in imprisoning\nhis illustrious rival. The secret of his prison place, however, appeared\nto have been so well kept that no information whatever was obtainable.\n\n\"We must carry out our original plan,\" he said at length, \"and journey\ninto the Tyrol. In one of the fortresses there he is most likely to be\nconfined.\"\n\nLeaving the capital they wandered up into the mountains for weeks,\nvisiting one castle after another. It was no easy matter in all cases to\nget so near to these prisons as to give a hope that their voice might be\nheard within, or an answer received without. More than once cross-bow\nbolts were shot at them from the walls when they did not obey the\nsentinel's challenge and move further away. Generally, however, it was in\nthe day time that they sang. Wandering carelessly up, they would sit down\nwithin earshot of the castle, open their wallets, and take out\nprovisions from their store, and then, having eaten and drunk, Blondel\nwould produce his lute and sing, as if for his own pleasure. It needed,\nhowever, four visits to each castle before they could be sure that the\ncaptive was not there; for the song had to be sung on each side.\nSometimes they would cheat themselves with the thought that they heard an\nanswering voice; but it was not until the end of the fourth week, when\nsinging outside the castle of Diernstein, that a full rich voice, when\nBlondel ceased, sang out the second stanza of the poem. With difficulty\nBlondel and Cuthbert restrained themselves from an extravagant exhibition\nof joy. They knew, however, that men on the prison wall were watching\nthem as they sat singing, and Blondel, with a final strain taken from a\nballad of a knight who, having discovered the hiding place of his\nladylove, prepared to free her from her oppressors, shouldered his lute,\nand they started on their homeward journey.\n\nThere was no delay now. At times they sang indeed at castles; but only\nwhen their store was exhausted, for upon these occasions Blondel would\nbe presented with a handsome goblet or other solid token of the owner's\napproval, and the sale of this at the next city would take them far on\ntheir way. They thought it better not to pass through France, as\nPhilip, they knew, was on the watch to prevent any news of King Richard\nreaching England. They therefore again passed through Brabant, and so\nby ship to England.\n\nHearing that Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, one of Richard's vicegerents, was\nover in Normandy, and rightly deeming him the most earnest of his\nadherents, they at once recrossed the sea, and found the warlike prelate\nat Rouen. Greatly delighted was he at hearing that Richard's hiding-place\nhad been discovered. He at once sent across the news to England, and\nordered it to be published far and wide, and himself announced it to the\nbarons of Normandy. Then with a gorgeous retinue, including Cuthbert and\nBlondel, he started for Vienna, and arriving there demanded an interview\nwith the emperor.\n\nThe news that it was now certain that Richard was imprisoned in a castle\nof the emperor, had already spread through Europe, and the bishop had\nbeen received everywhere with tokens of sympathy; and so great was the\nfeeling shown by the counts and barons of the empire, that the Emperor\nHenry felt that he could no longer refuse to treat for the surrender of\nhis captive. Therefore he granted the interview which Longchamp\ndemanded. The English envoy was received by the emperor surrounded by his\nnobles. The prelate advanced with great dignity.\n\n\"I come,\" he said, \"in the name of the people of England to demand the\nrestoration of King Richard, most unjustly and unknightly detained a\nprisoner in his passage through your dominions.\"\n\n\"King Richard was my foe,\" the emperor said, \"open and secret, and I was\njustified in detaining one who is alike my enemy and a scourge to Europe\nas a prisoner, when fortune threw him in my hands. I am, however, willing\nto put him to a ransom, and will upon the payment of 150,000 marks allow\nhim to go free.\"\n\n\"I deny your right to detain him or to put him to ransom,\" the bishop\nsaid. \"But as you have the power, so my denial is useless. England is\npoor, impoverished with war and by the efforts which she made in the\nservice of our holy religion. Nevertheless, poor as she is, she will\nraise the sum you demand. There is not an Englishman who will not furnish\nall he can afford for the rescue of our king. But once again, in the\npresence of your nobles, I denounce your conduct as base and unkingly.\"\n\nThe emperor could with difficulty restrain his passion; but the sight of\nthe sombre visages of his nobles showed that they shared in no slight\ndegree the feelings which the English envoy had so boldly announced.\n\n\"Before, however,\" the emperor said, \"I surrender King Richard, he\nmust be tried by my peers of many and various crimes of which he is\naccused. Should he be found guilty of these, no gold can purchase his\nrelease. Should he, however, be acquitted, then as my word is given so\nshall it be.\"\n\n\"Although,\" the prelate said, \"I deny your right to try our king, and\nbelieve that he himself will refuse to accept your jurisdiction, yet I\nfear not the result if our lord be left in the hands of the nobles of\nthe empire and not in yours. I can trust their honour and courtesy.\"\n\nAnd turning upon his heel, without another word he quitted the apartment.\n\nAn hour later the bishop and his following took horse and rode with all\nspeed to the north coast, and thence sailed for England. The news of the\namount of ransom filled the people with consternation; but preparations\nwere at once made for collecting the sum demanded. Queen Eleanor was\nunceasing in her efforts to raise the money for the release of her\nfavourite son. The nobles contributed their jewels and silver; the people\ngave contributions of goods, for money was so scarce in England that few\nhad the wherewithal to pay in coin. Prince John placed every obstacle in\nthe way of the collection; but the barons had since their successful\nstand obtained the upper hand, and it was by intrigue only that he could\nhinder the collection.\n\nIn the meantime, popular opinion throughout Europe was strong upon the\nside of King Richard. The pope himself wrote to the emperor on his\nbehalf. The barons of the empire were indignant at the shame placed upon\ntheir country; and the emperor, although he would fain have thrown\nfurther delays in the way, was obliged at last to order the first step\nto be taken.\n\nA solemn diet was ordered to assemble at Worms. Here were collected all\nthe nobles of the empire, and before them King Richard was brought. It\nwas a grand assembly. Upon a raised throne on the dais sat the emperor\nhimself, and beside him and near him were the great feudatories of the\nempire, and along the sides of the walls were ranged in long rows the\nlesser barons. When the doors were opened and King Richard entered, the\nwhole assembly, save the emperor, rose in respect to the captive monarch.\nAlthough pale from his long confinement, the proud air of Richard was in\nno way abated, and the eyes that had flashed so fearlessly upon the\nSaracens looked as sternly down the long lines of the barons of Germany.\nOf splendid stature and physique, King Richard was unquestionably the\nfinest man of his time. He was handsome, with a frank face, but with a\nfierce and passionate eye. He wore his moustache with a short beard and\nclosely-cut whisker. His short curly hair was cropped closely to his\nhead, upon which he wore a velvet cap with gold coronet, while a scarlet\nrobe lined with fur fell over his coat of mail, for the emperor had\ndeemed it imprudent to excite the feeling of the assembly in favour of\nthe prisoner by depriving him of the symbols of his rank.\n\nKing Richard strode to the place prepared for him, and then turning to\nthe assembly he said, in a voice which rang through the hall,--\n\n\"Counts and lords of the Empire of Germany, I, Richard, King of England,\ndo deny your right to try me. I am a king, and can only be tried by my\npeers and by the pope, who is the head of Christendom. I might refuse to\nplead, refuse to take any part in this assembly, and appeal to the pope,\nwho alone has power to punish kings. But I will waive my rights. I rely\nupon the honour and probity of the barons of Germany. I have done no man\nwrong, and would appear as fearlessly before an assembly of peasants as\nbefore a gathering of barons. Such faults as I may have, and none are\nwithout them, are not such as those with which I am charged. I have slain\nmany men in anger, but none by treachery. When Richard of England\nstrikes, he strikes in the light of day. He leaves poison and treachery\nto his enemies, and I hurl back with indignation and scorn in the teeth\nof him who makes them the charges brought against me.\"\n\nSo saying King Richard took his seat amidst a murmur of applause from the\ncrowded hall.\n\nThe trial then commenced. The accusations against Richard were of many\nkinds. Chief among them was the murder of Conrad of Montferat; but there\nwere charges of having brought the crusade to naught by thwarting the\ngeneral plans, by his arrogance in refusing to be bound by the decision\nof the other leaders, and by having made a peace contrary to the\ninterests of the crusaders. The list was a long one; but the evidence\nadduced was pitiably weak. Beyond the breath of suspicion, no word of\nreal evidence connecting him with the murder of Conrad of Montferat was\nadduced, and the other charges were supported by no better evidence. Many\nof the German barons who had been at the crusades themselves came\nforward to testify to the falsity of these charges, and the fact that\nRichard had himself placed Conrad of Montferat upon the throne, and had\nno possible interest in his death, was alone more than sufficient to\nnullify the vague rumours brought against him. Richard himself in a few\nscornful words disposed of this accusation. The accusation that he,\nRichard of England, would stoop to poison a man whom he could have\ncrushed in an instant, was too absurd to be seriously treated.\n\n\"I am sure,\" the king said, \"that not one person here believes this idle\ntale. That I did not always agree with the other leaders is true; but I\ncall upon every one here to say whether, had they listened to me and\nfollowed my advice, the crusade would not have had another ending. Even\nafter Phillip of France had withdrawn; even after I had been deserted by\nJohn of Austria, I led the troops of the crusaders from every danger and\nevery difficulty to within sight of the walls of Jerusalem. Had I been\nsupported with zeal, the holy city would have been ours; but the apathy,\nthe folly, and the weakness of the leaders brought ruin upon the army.\nThey thought not of conquering Jerusalem, but of thwarting me; and I\nretort upon them the charge of having sacrificed the success of the\ncrusade. As to the terms of peace, how were they made? I, with some fifty\nknights and 1000 followers alone remained in the Holy Land. Who else, I\nask, so circumstanced, could have obtained any terms whatever from\nSaladin? It was the weight of my arm alone which saved Jaffa and Acre,\nand the line of seacoast, to the Cross. And had I followed the example\nset me by him of Austria and the Frenchman, not one foot of the Holy Land\nwould now remain in Christian hands.\"\n\nThe trial was soon over, and without a single dissentient the King of\nEngland was acquitted of all the charges brought against him. But the\nmoney was not yet raised, and King Richard was taken back into the heart\nof Germany. At length, by prodigious exertions, half the amount claimed\nwas collected, and upon the solicitations of the pope and of the counts\nof his own empire, the emperor consented to release Richard upon, receipt\nof this sum and his royal promise that the remainder should be made up.\n\nNot as yet, however, were the intrigues at an end. Prince John and King\nPhillip alike implored the emperor to retain his captive, and offered to\nhim a larger sum than the ransom if he would still hold him in his hands.\nPopular opinion was, however, too strong. When the news of these\nnegotiations became bruited abroad, the counts of the empire, filled with\nindignation, protested against this shame and dishonour being brought\nupon the country. The pope threatened him with excommunication; and at\nlast the emperor, feeling that he would risk his throne did he further\ninsist, was forced to open the prison gates and let the king free.\nCuthbert, Blondel, and a few other trusty friends were at hand, and their\njoy at receiving their long-lost sovereign was indeed intense. Horses had\nbeen provided in readiness, and without a moment's delay the king\nstarted, for even at the last moment it was feared that the emperor might\nchange his mind. This indeed was the case. The king had not started many\nhours, when the arrival of fresh messengers from Phillip and John induced\nthe emperor once more to change his intentions, and a body of men were\nsent in pursuit of the king. The latter fortunately made no stay on the\nway, but changing horses frequently--for everywhere he was received with\nhonour and attention--he pushed forward for the coast of the North Sea,\nand arrived there two or three hours only before his oppressors.\nFortunately it was night, and taking a boat he embarked without a\nmoment's delay; and when the emissaries of the emperor arrived the boat\nwas already out of sight, and in the darkness pursuit was hopeless.\n\nOn landing at Dover, the first to present himself before him was Prince\nJohn, who, in the most abject terms besought pardon for the injuries he\nhad inflicted. King Richard waved him contemptuously aside.\n\n\"Go,\" he said, \"and may I forget your injuries as speedily as you will\nforget my pardon.\"\n\nThen taking horse, he rode on to London, where he was received with the\nmost lively acclamation by his subjects.\n\nThe first step of King Richard was to dispossess all the minions of John\nfrom the castles and lands which had been taken from his faithful\nadherents. Some of these resisted; but their fortresses were speedily\nstormed. Sir Rudolph was not one of these. Immediately the news of King\nRichard's arrival in England reached him, feeling that all was now lost,\nhe rode to the seacoast, took ship, and passed into France, and Cuthbert,\non his arrival at Evesham, found himself undisputed lord of the place. He\nfound that the hiding-place of his mother had not been discovered, and,\nafter a short delay to put matters in train, he, attended by a gallant\nretinue, rode into Wiltshire to the castle of Sir Baldwin of Bthune.\nHere he found the Lady Margaret safe and sound, and mightily pleased to\nsee him. She was now seventeen, and offered no objections whatever to the\ncommands of King Richard that she should at once bestow her hand upon the\nEarl of Evesham. By the king's order, the wedding took place at London,\nthe king himself bestowing the bride upon his faithful follower, whom we\nmay now leave to the enjoyment of the fortune and wife he had so\nvaliantly won.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n",
