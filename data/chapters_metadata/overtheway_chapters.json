Every morning at eight\no'clock the church bell chimed for Morning Prayer--chim! chime! chim!\nchime!--and every morning at eight o'clock the little old lady came\ndown the white steps, and opened the gate with a click, and went where\nthe bells were calling.\n\nAbout this time also little Ida would kneel on a chair at her nursery\nwindow in the opposite house to watch the old lady come out and go.\nThe old lady was one of those people who look always the same. Every\nmorning her cheeks looked like faded rose-leaves, and her white hair\nlike a snow-wreath in a garden laughing at the last tea-rose. Every\nmorning she wore the same black satin bonnet, and the same white\nshawl; had delicate gloves on the smallest of hands, and gathered her\nskirt daintily up from the smallest of feet. Every morning she carried\na clean pocket-handkerchief, and a fresh rose in the same hand with\nher Prayer-book; and as the Prayer-book, being bound up with the\nBible, was very thick, she seemed to have some difficulty in so doing.\nEvery morning, whatever the weather might be, she stood outside the\ngreen gate, and looked up at the sky to see if this were clear, and\ndown at the ground to see if that were dry; and so went where the\nbells were calling.\n\nIda knew the little old lady quite well by sight, but she did not know\nher name. Perhaps Ida's great-uncle knew it; but he was a grave,\nunsociable man, who saw very little of his neighbours, so perhaps he\ndid not; and Ida stood too much in awe of him to trouble him with idle\nquestions. She had once asked Nurse, but Nurse did not know; so the\nquiet orphan child asked no more. She made up a name for the little\nold lady herself, however, after the manner of Mr. John Bunyan, and\ncalled her Mrs. Overtheway; and morning after morning, though the\nbread-and-milk breakfast smoked upon the table, she would linger at\nthe window, beseeching--\n\n\"One minute more, dear Nurse! Please let me wait till Mrs. Overtheway\nhas gone to church.\"\n\nAnd when the little old lady had come out and gone, Ida would creep\nfrom her perch, and begin her breakfast. Then, if the chimes went on\ntill half the basinful was eaten, little Ida would nod her head\ncontentedly, and whisper--\n\n\"Mrs. Overtheway was in time.\"\n\nLittle Ida's history was a sad one. Her troubles began when she was\nbut a year old, with the greatest of earthly losses--for then her\nmother died, leaving a sailor husband and their infant child. The\nsea-captain could face danger, but not an empty home; so he went back\nto the winds and the waves, leaving his little daughter with\nrelations. Six long years had he been away, and Ida had had many\nhomes, and yet, somehow, no home, when one day the postman brought her\na large letter, with her own name written upon it in a large hand.\nThis was no old envelope sealed up again--no make-believe epistle to\nbe put into the post through the nursery door: it was a real letter,\nwith a real seal, real stamps, and a great many post-marks; and when\nIda opened it there were two sheets written by the Captain's very own\nhand, in round fat characters, easy to read, with a sketch of the\nCaptain's very own ship at the top, and--most welcome above all!--the\nnews that the Captain's very own self was coming home.\n\n\"I shall have a papa all to myself very soon, Nurse,\" said Ida. \"He\nhas written a letter to me, and made me a picture of his ship; it is\nthe 'Bonne Esperance,' which he says means Good Hope. I love this\nletter better than anything he has ever sent me.\"\n\nNevertheless, Ida took out the carved fans and workboxes, the beads,\nand handkerchiefs, and feathers, the dainty foreign treasures the\nsailor-father had sent to her from time to time; dusted them, kissed\nthem, and told them that the Captain was coming home. But the letter\nshe wore in her pocket by day, and kept under her pillow by night.\n\n\"Why don't you put your letter into one of your boxes, like a tidy\nyoung lady, Miss Ida?\" said Nurse. \"You'll wear it all to bits doing\nas you do.\"\n\n\"It will last till the ship comes home,\" said Miss Ida.\n\nIt had need then to have been written on the rock, graven with an iron\npen for ever; for the \"Bonne Esperance\" (like other earthly hopes) had\nperished to return no more. She foundered on her homeward voyage, and\nwent down into the great waters, whilst Ida slept through the stormy\nnight, with the Captain's letter beneath her pillow.\n\nAlas! Alas! Alas!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo or three months had now passed away since Ida became an orphan.\nShe had become accustomed to the crape-hung frock; she had learnt to\nread the Captain's letter as the memorial of a good hope which it had\npleased God to disappoint; she was fairly happy again. It was in the\nmidst of that new desolation in her lonely life that she had come to\nstay with her great-uncle, and had begun to watch the doings of the\nlittle old lady who lived over the way. When dolls seemed vanity, and\nNoah's Ark a burden, it had been a quiet amusement, demanding no\nexertion, to see what little she could see of the old lady's life, and\nto speculate about what she could not; to wonder and fancy what Mrs.\nOvertheway looked like without her bonnet, and what she did with\nherself when she was not at church. Ida's imagination did not carry\nher far. She believed her friend to be old, immeasurably old,\nindefinitely old; and had a secret faith that she had never been\notherwise. She felt sure that she wore a cap indoors, and that it was\na nicer one than Nurse's; that she had real tea, with sugar and cream,\ninstead of milk-and-water, and hot toast rather than bread-and-treacle\nfor tea; that she helped herself at meals, and went to bed according\nto her own pleasure and convenience; was--perhaps on these very\ngrounds--utterly happy, and had always been so.\n\n\"I am only a little girl,\" said Ida, as she pressed her face sadly to\nthe cold window-pane. \"I am only a little girl, and very sad, you\nknow, because Papa was drowned at sea; but Mrs. Overtheway is very\nold, and always happy, and so I love her.\"\n\nAnd in this there was both philosophy and truth.\n\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the happiness of others is always a\ndistasteful sight to the sad at heart. There are times in which life\nseems shorn of interests and bereaved of pleasure, when it is a\nrelief, almost amounting to consolation, to believe that any one is\nhappy. It is some feeling of this nature, perhaps, which makes the\nyoung so attractive to the old. It soothes like the sound of\nharmonious music, the sight of harmonious beauty. It witnesses to a\nconviction lying deep even in the most afflicted souls that (come what\nmay), all things were created good, and man made to be blessed; before\nwhich sorrow and sighing flee away.\n\nThis was one of many things which formed the attraction for Ida in the\nlittle old lady who lived over the way. That green gate shut in a life\nof which the child knew nothing, and which might be one of mysterious\ndelights; to believe that such things could be was consoling, and to\nimagine them was real entertainment. Ida would sometimes draw a chair\nquietly to the table beside her own, and fancy that Mrs. Overtheway\nwas having tea with her. She would ask the old lady if she had been in\ntime for church that morning, beg her to take off her bonnet, and\napologise politely for the want of hot tea and toast. So far all was\nwell, for Ida could answer any of these remarks on Mrs. Overtheway's\nbehalf; but it may be believed that after a certain point this\none-sided conversation flagged. One day Nurse overheard Ida's low\nmurmurs.\n\n\"What are you talking about, Miss Ida?\" said she.\n\n\"I am pretending to have Mrs. Overtheway to tea,\" said Ida.\n\n\"Little girls shouldn't pretend what's not true,\" replied Nurse, in\nwhose philosophy fancy and falsehood were not distinguished. \"Play\nwith your dolls, my dear, and don't move the chairs out of their\nplaces.\"\n\nWith which Nurse carried off the chair into a corner as if it had been\na naughty child, and Ida gave up her day-dream with a sigh; since to\nhave prolonged the fancy that Mrs. Overtheway was present, she must\nhave imagined her borne off at the crisis of the meal after a fashion\nnot altogether consistent with an old lady's dignity.\n\nSummer passed, and winter came on. There were days when the white\nsteps looked whiter than usual; when the snowdrift came halfway up the\nlittle green gate, and the snowflakes came softly down with a\npersistency which threatened to bury the whole town. Ida knew that on\nsuch days Mrs. Overtheway could not go out; but whenever it was\ntolerably fine the old lady appeared as usual, came daintily down the\nsteps, and went where the bells were calling. Chim! chime! chim!\nchime! They sounded so near through the frosty air, that Ida could\nalmost have fancied that the church was coming round through the snowy\nstreets to pick up the congregation.\n\nMrs. Overtheway looked much the same in winter as in summer. She\nseemed as fresh and lively as ever, carried her Prayer-book and\nhandkerchief in the same hand, was only more warmly wrapped up, and\nwore fur-lined boots, which were charming. There was one change,\nhowever, which went to Ida's heart. The little old lady had no longer\na flower to take to church with her. At Christmas she took a sprig of\nholly, and after that a spray of myrtle, but Ida felt that these were\npoor substitutes for a rose. She knew that Mrs. Overtheway had flowers\nsomewhere, it is true, for certain pots of forced hyacinths had passed\nthrough the little green gate to the Christmas church decorations; but\none's winter garden is too precious to be cropped as recklessly as\nsummer rose-bushes, and the old lady went flowerless to church and\nenjoyed her bulbs at home. But the change went to Ida's heart.\n\nSpring was early that year. At the beginning of February there was a\ngood deal of snow on the ground, it is true, but the air became milder\nand milder, and towards the end of the month there came a real spring\nday, and all the snow was gone.\n\n\"You may go and play in the garden, Miss Ida,\" said Nurse, and Ida\nwent.\n\nShe had been kept indoors for a long time by the weather and by a\ncold, and it was very pleasant to get out again, even when the only\namusement was to run up and down the shingly walks and wonder how soon\nshe might begin to garden, and whether the gardener could be induced\nto give her a piece of ground sufficiently extensive to grow a crop of\nmustard-and-cress in the form of a capital I. It was the kitchen\ngarden into which Ida had been sent. At the far end it was cut off\nfrom the world by an overgrown hedge with large gaps at the bottom,\nthrough which Ida could see the high road, a trough for watering\nhorses, and beyond this a wood. The hedge was very thin in February,\nand Ida had a good view in consequence, and sitting on a stump in the\nsunshine she peered through the gap to see if any horses came to\ndrink. It was as good as a peep-show, and indeed much better.\n\n\"The snow has melted,\" gurgled the water, \"here I am.\" It was\neverywhere. The sunshine made the rich green mosses look dry, but in\nreality they were wet, and so was everything else. Slish! slosh! Put\nyour feet where you would, the water was everywhere. It filled the\nstone trough, which, being old and grey and steady, kept it still, and\nbade it reflect the blue sky and the gorgeous mosses; but the trough\nsoon overflowed, and then the water slipped over the side, and ran off\nin a wayside stream. \"Winter is gone!\" it spluttered as it ran.\n\"Winter is gone, winter-is-gone, winterisgone!\" And, on the principle\nthat a good thing cannot be said too often, it went on with this all\nthrough the summer, till the next winter came and stopped its mouth\nwith icicles. As the stream chattered, so the birds in the wood\nsang--Tweet! tweet! chirrup! throstle! Spring! Spring! Spring!--and\nthey twittered from tree to tree, and shook the bare twigs with\nmelody; whilst a single blackbird sitting still upon a bough below,\nsang \"Life!\" \"Life!\" \"Life!\" with the loudest pipe of his throat,\nbecause on such a day it was happiness only to be alive.\n\nIt was like a wonderful fairy-tale, to which Ida listened with clasped\nhands.\n\nPresently another song came from the wood: it was a hymn sung by\nchildren's voices, such as one often hears carolled by a troop of\nlittle urchins coming home from school. The words fell familiarly on\nIda's ears:\n\n    \"Quite through the streets with silver sound,\n      The flood of life doth flow;\n    Upon whose banks on every side\n      The wood of life doth grow.\n\n    \"Thy gardens and thy gallant walks\n      Continually are green;\n    There grow such sweet and pleasant flowers\n      As nowhere else are seen.\n\n    \"There trees for evermore bear fruit,\n      And evermore do spring;\n    There evermore the Angels sit,\n      And evermore do sing.\"\n\nHere the little chorus broke off, and the children came pouring out of\nthe wood with chattering and laughter. Only one lingered, playing\nunder a tree, and finishing the song. The child's voice rose shrill\nand clear like that of the blackbird above him. He also sang of\nLife--Eternal life--knowing little more than the bird of the meaning\nof his song, and having little less of that devotion of innocence in\nwhich happiness is praise.\n\nBut Ida had ceased to listen to the singing. Her whole attention was\ngiven to the children as they scampered past the hedge, dropping bits\nof moss and fungi and such like woodland spoil. For, tightly held in\nthe grubby hands of each--plucked with reckless indifference to bud\nand stalk, and fading fast in their hot prisons--were primroses. Ida\nstarted to her feet, a sudden idea filling her brain. The birds were\nright, Spring had come, and there were flowers--_flowers for Mrs.\nOvertheway_.\n\nIda was a very quiet, obedient little girl, as a general rule; indeed,\nin her lonely life she had small temptation to pranks or mischief of\nany kind. She had often been sent to play in the back garden before,\nand had never thought of straying beyond its limits; but to-day a\nstrong new feeling had been awakened by the sight of the primroses.\n\n\"The hole is very large,\" said Ida, looking at the gap in the hedge;\n\"if that dead root in the middle were pulled up, it would be\nwonderfully large.\"\n\nShe pulled the root up, and, though wonderful is a strong term, the\nhole was certainly larger.\n\n\"It is big enough to put one's head through,\" said Ida, and, stooping\ndown, she exemplified the truth of her observation.\n\n\"Where the head goes, the body will follow,\" they say, and Ida's\nlittle body was soon on the other side of the hedge; the adage says\nnothing about clothes, however, and part of Ida's dress was left\nbehind. It had caught on the stump as she scrambled through. But\naccidents will happen, and she was in the road, which was something.\n\n\"It is like going into the world to seek one's fortune,\" she thought;\n\"thus Gerda went to look for little Kay, and so Joringel sought for\nthe enchanted flower. One always comes to a wood.\"\n\nAnd into the wood she came. Dame Nature had laid down her new green\ncarpets, and everything looked lovely; but, as has been before said,\nit certainly was damp. The little singer under the tree cared no more\nfor this, however, than the blackbird above him.\n\n\"Will you tell me, please, where you got your primroses?\" asked Ida.\n\nThe child made a quaint, half-military salute; and smiled.\n\n\"Yonder,\" he said laconically, and, pointing up the wood, he went on\nwith the song that he could not understand:\n\n    \"Ah, my sweet home, Jerusalem,\n      Would God I were in thee!\n     Would God my woes were at an end,\n      Thy joys that I might see!\"\n\nIda went on and on, looking about her as she ran. Presently the wood\nsloped downwards, and pretty steeply, so that it was somewhat of a\nscramble; yet still she kept a sharp look-out, but no primroses did\nshe see, except a few here and there upon the ground, which had been\nplucked too close to their poor heads to be held in anybody's hands.\nThese showed the way, however, and Ida picked them up in sheer pity\nand carried them with her.\n\n\"This is how Hop-o'-my-Thumb found his way home,\" she thought.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill ran a little brook, and on the opposite side\nof the brook was a bank, and on the top of the bank was a hedge, and\nunder the hedge were the primroses. But the brook was between!\n\nIda looked and hesitated. It was too wide to jump across, and here, as\nelsewhere, there was more water than usual. To turn back, however, was\nout of the question. Gerda would not have been daunted in her search\nby coming to a stream, nor would any one else that ever was read of in\nfairy tales. It is true that in Fairy-land there are advantages which\ncannot always be reckoned upon by commonplace children in this\ncommonplace world. When the straw, the coal, and the bean came to a\nrivulet in their travels, the straw laid himself across as a bridge\nfor the others, and had not the coal been a degree too hot on that\nunlucky occasion, they might (for anything Ida knew to the contrary)\nstill have been pursuing their journey in these favourable\ncircumstances. But a travelling-companion who expands into a bridge on\nan emergency is not to be met with every day; and as to poor Ida--she\nwas alone. She stood first on one leg, and then on the other, she\nlooked at the water, and then at the primroses, and then at the water\nagain, and at last perceived that in one place there was a large,\nflat, moss-covered stone in the middle of the stream, which stood well\nout of the water, and from which--could she but reach it--she might\nscramble to the opposite bank. But how to reach it? that nice, large,\nsecure, comfortable-looking stone.\n\n\"I must put some more stones,\" thought Ida. There were plenty in the\nstream, and Ida dragged them up, and began to make a ford by piling\nthem together. It was chilly work, for a cloud had come over the sun;\nand Ida was just a little bit frightened by the fresh-water shrimps,\nand some queer, many-legged beasts, who shot off the stones as she\nlifted them. At last the ford was complete. Ida stepped daintily over\nthe bridge she had made, and jumped triumphantly on to the big stone.\nAlas! for trusting to appearances. The stone that looked so firm, was\ninsecurely balanced below, and at the first shock one side went down\nwith a splash, and Ida went with it. What a triumph for the shrimps!\nShe scrambled to the bank, however, made up a charming bunch of\nprimroses, and turned to go home. Never mind how she got back across\nthe brook. We have all waded streams before now, and very good fun it\nis in June, but rather chilly work in February; and, in spite of\nrunning home, Ida trembled as much with cold as with excitement when\nshe stood at last before Mrs. Overtheway's green gate.\n\nClick! Ida went up the white steps, marking them sadly with her wet\nfeet, and gave a valiant rap. The door was opened, and a tall, rather\nsevere-looking housekeeper asked:\n\n\"What do you want, my dear?\"\n\nA shyness, amounting to terror, had seized upon Ida, and she could\nhardly find voice to answer.\n\n\"If you please, I have brought these for--\"\n\nFor whom? Ida's pale face burnt crimson as she remembered that after\nall she did not know the little old lady's name. Perhaps the severe\nhousekeeper was touched by the sight of the black frock, torn as it\nwas, for she said kindly:\n\n\"Don't be frightened, my dear. What do you want?\"\n\n\"These primroses,\" said Ida, who was almost choking. \"They are for\nMrs. Overtheway to take to church with her. I am very sorry, if you\nplease, but I don't know her name, and I call her Mrs. Overtheway\nbecause, you know, she lives over the way. At least--\" Ida added,\nlooking back across the road with a sudden confusion in her ideas,\n\"at least--I mean--you know--_we_ live over the way.\" And overwhelmed\nwith shame at her own stupidity, Ida stuffed the flowers into the\nwoman's hand, and ran home as if a lion were at her heels.\n\n\"Well! Miss Ida,\" began Nurse, as Ida opened the nursery door\n(and there was something terrible in her \"well\"); \"if I ever--\" and\nNurse seized Ida by the arm, which was generally premonitory of her\nfavourite method of punishment--\"a good shaking.\" But Ida clung close\nand flung her arms round Nurse's neck.\n\n\"Don't shake me, Nursey, dear,\" she begged, \"my head aches so. I have\nbeen very naughty, I know. I've done everything you can think of; I've\ncrept through the hedge, and been right through the wood, and made a\nford, and tumbled into the brook, and waded back, and run all the way\nhome, and been round by the town for fear you should see me. And I've\ndone something you could never, never think of if you tried till next\nChristmas, I've got some flowers for Mrs. Overtheway, only I did it so\nstupidly; she will think me a perfect goose, and perhaps be angry,\"\nand the tears came into Ida's eyes.\n\n\"She'll think you a naughty, troublesome child, as you are,\" said\nNurse, who seldom hesitated to assume the responsibility of any\nstatement that appeared to be desirable; \"you're mad on that old lady,\nI think. Just look at that dress!\"\n\nIda looked, but her tears were falling much too fast for her to have a\nclear view of anything, and the torn edges of the rent seemed fringed\nwith prismatic colours.\n\nTo crown all she was sent to bed. In reality, this was to save the\nnecessity of wearing her best frock till the other was mended, and\nalso to keep her warm in case she should have caught cold; but Nurse\nspoke of it as a punishment, and Ida wept accordingly. And this was a\ntriumph of that not uncommon line of nursery policy which consists in\nelaborately misleading the infant mind for good.\n\nChim! chime! went the bells next morning, and Mrs. Overtheway came\ndown the white steps and through the green gate with a bunch of\nprimroses in her hand. She looked up as usual, but not to the sky. She\nlooked to the windows of the houses over the way, as if she expected\nsome one to be looking for her. There was no face to be seen, however;\nand in the house directly opposite, one of the upper blinds was drawn\ndown. Ida was ill.\n\nHow long she was ill, and of what was the matter with her, Ida had no\nvery clear idea. She had visions of toiling through the wood over and\nover again, looking vainly for something that could never be found; of\nbeing suddenly surrounded and cut off by swollen streams; and of\ncrawling, unclean beasts with preternatural feelers who got into her\nboots. Then these heavy dreams cleared away in part, and the stream\nseemed to ripple like the sound of church bells, and these chimed out\nthe old tune\n\n    \"Quite through the streets, with silver sound,\" &c.\n\nAnd then, at last, she awoke one fine morning to hear the sweet\nchim-chiming of the church bells, and to see Nurse sitting by her\nbedside. She lay still for a few moments to make quite sure, and then\nasked in a voice so faint that it surprised herself:\n\n\"Has Mrs. Overtheway gone to church?\"\n\nOn which, to her great astonishment, Nurse burst into tears. For this\nwas the first reasonable sentence that poor Ida had spoken for several\ndays.\n\nTo be very ill is not pleasant; but the slow process of getting back\nstrength is often less pleasant still. One afternoon Ida knelt in her\nold place at the window. She was up, but might not go out, and this\nwas a great grief. The day had been provokingly fine, and even now,\nthough the sun was setting, it seemed inclined to make a fresh start,\nso bright was the rejuvenated glow with which it shone upon the\nopposite houses, and threw a mystic glory over Mrs. Overtheway's white\nsteps and green railings. Oh! how Ida had wished to go out that\nafternoon! How long and clear the shadows were! It seemed to Ida that\nwhoever was free to go into the open air could have nothing more to\ndesire. \"Out of doors\" looked like Paradise to the drooping little\nmaid, and the passers-by seemed to go up and down the sunny street in\na golden dream. Ida gazed till the shadows lengthened, and crept over\nthe street and up the houses; till the sunlight died upon the\nrailings, and then upon the steps, and at last lingered for half an\nhour in bright patches among the chimney-stacks, and then went out\naltogether, and left the world in shade.\n\nTwilight came on and Ida sat by the fire, which rose into importance\nnow that the sunshine was gone; and, moreover, spring evenings are\ncold.\n\nIda felt desolate, and, on the whole, rather ill-used. Nurse had not\nbeen upstairs for hours, and though she had promised real tea and\ntoast this evening, there were no signs of either as yet. The poor\nchild felt too weak to play, and reading made her eyes ache. If only\nthere were some one to tell her a story.\n\nIt grew dark, and then steps came outside the door, and a fumbling\nwith the lock which made Ida nervous.\n\n\"Do come in, Nursey!\" she cried.\n\nThe door opened, and someone spoke; but the voice was not the voice of\nNurse. It was a sweet, clear, gentle voice; musical, though no longer\nyoung; such a voice as one seldom hears and never forgets, which came\nout of the darkness, saying:\n\n\"It is not Nurse, my dear; she is making the tea, and gave me leave\nto come up alone. I am Mrs. Overtheway.\"\n\nAnd there in the firelight stood the little old lady, as she has been\nbefore described, except that instead of her Prayer-book she carried a\nlarge pot hyacinth in her two hands.\n\n\"I have brought you one of my pets, my dear,\" said she. \"I think we\nboth love flowers.\"\n\nThe little old lady had come to tea. This was charming. She took off\nher bonnet, and her cap more than fulfilled Ida's expectations,\nalthough it was nothing smarter than a soft mass of tulle, tied with\nwhite satin strings. But what a face looked out of it! Mrs.\nOvertheway's features were almost perfect. The beauty of her eyes was\nrather enhanced by the blue shadows that Time had painted round them,\nand they were those good eyes which remind one of a clear well, at the\nbottom of which he might see truth. When young she must have been\nexquisitely beautiful, Ida thought. She was lovely still.\n\nIn due time Nurse brought up tea, and Ida could hardly believe that\nher fancies were realized at last; indeed more than realized--for no\nbread and treacle diminished the dignity of the entertainment; and\nNurse would as soon have thought of carrying off the Great Mogul on\nhis cushions, as of putting Mrs. Overtheway and her chair into the\ncorner.\n\nBut there is a limit even to the space of time for which one can\nenjoy tea and buttered toast. The tray was carried off, the hyacinth\nput in its place, and Ida curled herself up in an easy chair on one\nside of the fire, Mrs. Overtheway being opposite.\n\n\"You see I am over the way still,\" laughed the little old lady. \"Now,\ntell me all about the primroses.\" So Ida told everything, and\napologized for her awkward speeches to the housekeeper.\n\n\"I don't know your name yet,\" said she.\n\n\"Call me Mrs. Overtheway still, my dear, if you please,\" said the\nlittle old lady. \"I like it.\"\n\nSo Ida was no wiser on this score.\n\n\"I was so sorry to hear that you had been made ill on my account,\"\nsaid Mrs. Overtheway. \"I have been many times to ask after you, and\nto-night I asked leave to come to tea. I wish I could do something to\namuse you, you poor little invalid. I know you must feel dull.\"\n\nIda's cheeks flushed.\n\n\"If you would only tell me a story,\" she said, \"I do so like hearing\nNurse's stories. At least she has only one, but I like it. It isn't\nexactly a story either, but it is about what happened in her last\nplace. But I am rather tired of it. There's Master Henry--I like him\nvery much, he was always in mischief; and there's Miss Adelaide, whose\nhair curled naturally--at least with a damp brush--I like her; but I\ndon't have much of them; for Nurse generally goes off about a quarrel\nshe had with the cook, and I never could tell what they quarrelled\nabout, but Nurse said cook was full of malice and deceitfulness, so\nshe left. I'm rather tired of it.\"\n\n\"What sort of a story shall I tell you?\" asked Mrs. Overtheway.\n\n\"A true one, I think,\" said Ida. \"Something that happened to you\nyourself, if you please. You must remember a great many things, being\nso old.\"\n\nAnd Ida said this in simple good-faith, believing it to be a\ncompliment.\n\n\"It is quite true,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, \"that one remembers many\nthings at the end of a long life, and that they are often those things\nwhich happened a long while ago, and which are sometimes so slight in\nthemselves that it is wonderful that they should not have been\nforgotten. I remember, for instance, when I was about your age, an\nincident that occurred which gave me an intense dislike to a special\nshade of brown satin. I hated it then, and at the end of more than\nhalf a century, I hate it still. The thing in itself was a mere folly;\nthe people concerned in it have been dead for many years, and yet at\nthe present time I should find considerable difficulty in seeing the\nmerits of a person who should dress in satin of that peculiar hue.\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Ida.\n\n\"It was not amber satin, and it was not snuff-coloured satin; it was\none of the shades of brown known by the name of feuille-morte, or\ndead-leaf colour. It is pretty in itself, and yet I dislike it.\"\n\n\"How funny,\" said Ida, wriggling in the arm-chair with satisfaction.\n\"Do tell me about it.\"\n\n\"But it is not funny in the least, unfortunately,\" said Mrs.\nOvertheway, laughing. \"It isn't really a story, either. It is not even\nlike Nurse's experiences. It is only a strong remembrance of my\nchildhood, that isn't worth repeating, and could hardly amuse you.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, it would,\" said Ida. \"I like the sound of it. Satin\nis so different from cooks.\"\n\nMrs. Overtheway laughed.\n\n\"Still, I wish I could think of something more entertaining,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Please tell me that,\" said Ida, earnestly; \"I would rather hear\nsomething about you than anything else.\"\n\nThere was no resisting this loving argument. Ida felt she had gained\nher point, and curled herself up into a listening attitude\naccordingly. The hyacinth stood in solemn sweetness as if it were\nlistening also; and Mrs. Overtheway, putting her little feet upon the\nfender to warm, began the story of ----\n\n\n\n\nMRS. MOSS.\n\n    \"It did not move my grief, to see\n      The trace of human step departed,\n      Because the garden was deserted,\n     The blither place for me!\n\n    \"Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken\n      Hath childhood 'twixt the sun and sward:\n      We draw the moral afterward--\n     We feel the gladness then.\"\n\nE. BARRETT BROWNING.\n\n\n\"I remember,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, \"old as I am, I remember\ndistinctly many of the unrecognized vexations, longings, and\ndisappointments of childhood. By unrecognized, I mean those vexations,\nlongings, and disappointments which could not be understood by nurses,\nare not confided even to mothers, and through which, even in our\ncradles, we become subject to that law of humanity which gives to\nevery heart its own secret bitterness to be endured alone. These are\nthey which sometimes outlive weightier memories, and produce life-long\nimpressions disproportionate to their value; but oftener, perhaps, are\nwashed away by the advancing tide of time--the vexations, longings,\nand disappointments of the next period of our lives. These are they\nwhich are apt to be forgotten too soon to benefit our children, and\nwhich in the forgetting make childhood all bright to look back upon,\nand foster that happy fancy that there is one division of mortal life\nin which greedy desire, unfulfilled purpose, envy, sorrow, weariness\nand satiety, have no part, by which every man believes himself at\nleast to have been happy as a child.\n\n\"My childhood, on the whole, was a very happy one. The story that I am\nabout to relate is only a fragment of it.\n\n\"As I look into the fire, and the hot coals shape themselves into a\nthousand memories of the past, I seem to be staring with childish eyes\nat a board that stares back at me out of a larch plantation, and gives\nnotice that 'This House is to Let.' Then, again, I seem to peep\nthrough rusty iron gates at the house itself--an old red house, with\nlarge windows, through which one could see the white shutters that\nwere always closed. To look at this house, though only with my mind's\neye, recalls the feeling of mysterious interest with which I looked at\nit fifty years ago, and brings back the almost oppressive happiness of\na certain day, when Sarah, having business with the couple who kept\nthe empty manor, took me with her, and left me to explore the grounds\nwhilst she visited her friends.\n\n\"Next to a companion with that rare sympathy of mind to mind, that\nexceptional coincidence of tastes, which binds some few friendships in\na chain of mesmeric links, supplanting all the complacencies of love\nby intuition, is a companion whose desires and occupations are in\nharmony, if not in unison, with one's own. That friend whom the long\npatience of the angler does not chafe, the protracted pleasures of the\nsketcher do not weary, because time flies as swiftly with him whilst\nhe pores over his book, or devoutly seeks botanical specimens through\nthe artist's middle distance; that friend, in short--that valuable\nfriend--who is blessed with the great and good quality of riding a\nhobby of his own, and the greater and better quality of allowing other\npeople to ride theirs.\n\n\"I did not think out all this fifty years ago, neither were the tastes\nof that excellent housemaid, Sarah, quite on a level with those of\nwhich I have spoken; but I remember feeling the full comfort of the\nfact that Sarah's love for friendly gossip was quite as ardent as mine\nfor romantic discovery; that she was disposed to linger quite as long\nto chat as I to explore; and that she no more expected me to sit\nwearily through her kitchen confidences, than I imagined that she\nwould give a long afternoon to sharing my day-dreams in the gardens of\nthe deserted manor.\n\n\"We had ridden our respective hobbies till nearly tea-time before she\nappeared.\n\n\"'I'm afraid you must be tired of waiting, Miss Mary,' said she.\n\n\"'Tired!' I exclaimed, 'not in the least. I have been so happy, and I\nam so much obliged to you, Sarah.'\n\n\"Need I say why I was so happy that afternoon? Surely most people have\nfelt--at least in childhood--the fascination of deserted gardens,\nuninhabited houses, ruined churches. They have that advantage over\nwhat is familiar and in use that undiscovered regions have over the\ncomfortable one that the traveller leaves to explore them, that the\nsecret which does not concern me has over the facts which do, that\nwhat we wish for has over what we possess.\n\n\"If you, my dear, were to open one of those drawers, and find Nurse's\nSunday dress folded up in the corner, it would hardly amuse you; but\nif, instead thereof, you found a dress with a long stiff bodice,\nsquare at the neck, and ruffled round the sleeves, such as you have\nseen in old pictures, no matter how old or useless it might be, it\nwould shed round it an atmosphere of delightful and mysterious\nspeculations. This curiosity, these fancies, roused by the ancient\ndress, whose wearer has passed away, are awakened equally by empty\nhouses where someone must once have lived, though his place knows him\nno more. It was so with the manor. How often had I peeped through the\ngates, catching sight of garden walks, and wondering whither they led,\nand who had walked in them; seeing that the shutters behind one window\nwere partly open, and longing to look in.\n\n\"To-day I had been in the walks and peeped through the window. This\nwas the happiness.\n\n\"Through the window I had seen a large hall with a marble floor and\nbroad stone stairs winding upwards into unknown regions. By the walks\nI had arrived at the locked door of the kitchen garden, at a small\nwood or wilderness of endless delights (including a broken swing), and\nat a dilapidated summer-house. I had wandered over the spongy lawn,\nwhich was cut into a long green promenade by high clipt yew-hedges,\nwalking between which, in olden times, the ladies grew erect and\nstately, as plants among brushwood stretch up to air and light.\n\n\"Finally, I had brought away such relics as it seemed to me that\nhonesty would allow. I had found half a rusty pair of scissors in the\nsummer-house. Perhaps some fair lady of former days had lost them\nhere, and swept distractedly up and down the long walks seeking them.\nPerhaps they were a present, and she had given a luck-penny for them,\nlest they should cut love. Sarah said the housekeeper might have\ndropped them there; but Sarah was not a person of sentiment. I did not\nshow her the marble I found by the hedge, the acorn I picked up in the\npark, nor a puny pansy which, half way back to a wild heartsease, had\ntouched me as a pathetic memorial of better days. When I got home, I\nput the scissors, the marble, and the pansy into a box. The acorn I\nhung in a bottle of water--it was to be an oak tree.\n\n\"Properly speaking, I was not at home just then, but on a visit to my\ngrandmother and a married aunt without children who lived with her. A\nfever had broken out in my own home, and my visit here had been\nprolonged to keep me out of the way of infection. I was very happy and\ncomfortable except for one single vexation, which was this:\n\n\"I slept on a little bed in what had once been the nursery, a large\nroom which was now used as a workroom. A great deal of sewing was done\nin my grandmother's house, and the sewing-maid and at least one other\nof the servants sat there every evening. A red silk screen was put\nbefore my bed to shield me from the candlelight, and I was supposed\nto be asleep when they came upstairs. But I never remember to have\nbeen otherwise than wide awake, nervously awake, wearily awake. This\nwas the vexation. I was not a strong child, and had a very excitable\nbrain; and the torture that it was to hear those maids gossiping on\nthe other side of the dim red light of my screen I cannot well\ndescribe, but I do most distinctly remember. I tossed till the clothes\ngot hot, and threw them off till I got cold, and stopped my ears, and\npulled the sheet over my face, and tried not to listen, and listened\nin spite of all. They told long stories, and made many jokes that I\ncouldn't understand; sometimes I heard names that I knew, and fancied\nI had learnt some wonderful secret. Sometimes, on the contrary, I made\nnoises to intimate that I was awake, when one of them would rearrange\nmy glaring screen, and advise me to go to sleep; and then they talked\nin whispers, which was more distracting still.\n\n\"One evening--some months after my ramble round the manor--the maids\nwent out to tea, and I lay in peaceful silence watching the shadows\nwhich crept noiselessly about the room as the fire blazed, and wishing\nSarah and her colleagues nothing less than a month of uninterrupted\ntea-parties. I was almost asleep when Aunt Harriet came into the room.\nShe brought a candle, put up my screen (the red screen again!), and\nwent to the work-table. She had not been rustling with the work things\nfor many minutes when my grandmother followed her, and shut the door\nwith an air which seemed to promise a long stay. She also gave a\nshove to my screen, and then the following conversation began:\n\n\"'I have been to Lady Sutfield's to-day, Harriet.'\n\n\"'Indeed, ma'am.' But my aunt respectfully continued her work, as I\ncould hear by the scraping of the scissors along the table.\n\n\"'I heard some news there. The manor is let.'\n\n\"I almost jumped in my bed, and Aunt Harriet's scissors paused.\n\n\"'Let, ma'am! To whom!'\n\n\"'To a Mrs. Moss. You must have heard me speak of her. I knew her\nyears ago, when we were both young women. Anastatia Eden, she was\nthen.'\n\n\"I could hear my aunt move to the fire, and sit down.\n\n\"'The beautiful Miss Eden? Whom did she marry at last? Was there not\nsome love-affair of hers that you knew about?'\n\n\"'Her love-affairs were endless. But you mean Mr. Sandford. She\ntreated him very ill--very ill.'\n\n\"There was a pause, while the fire crackled in the silence; and then,\nto the infinite satisfaction of my curiosity, Aunt Harriet said:\n\n\"'I've forgotten the story, ma'am. He was poor, was he not?'\n\n\"'He had quite enough to marry on,' my grandmother answered,\nenergetically; 'but he was not a great match. It was an old story, my\ndear. The world! The world! The world! I remember sitting up with\nAnastatia after a ball, where he had been at her side all the evening.\nWe sipped hot posset, and talked of our partners. Ah, dear!' and here\nmy grandmother heaved a sigh; partly, perhaps, because of the follies\nof youth, and partly, perhaps, because youth had gone, and could come\nback no more.\n\n\"'Anastatia talked of him,' she continued. 'I remember her asking me\nif “her man” were not a pretty fellow, and if he had not sweet blue\neyes and the greatest simplicity I ever knew but in a child. It was\ntrue enough; and he was a great deal more than that--a great deal more\nthan she ever understood. Poor Anastatia! I advised her to marry him,\nbut she seemed to look on that as impossible. I remember her saying\nthat it would be different if she were not an acknowledged beauty; but\nit was expected that she would marry well, and he was comparatively\npoor, and not even singular. He was accomplished, and the soul of\nhonour, but simple, provokingly simple, with no pretensions to carry\noff the toast of a county. My dear, if he had been notorious in any\nway--for dissipation, for brawling, for extravagance--I believe it\nwould have satisfied the gaping world, and he would have had a chance.\nBut there was nothing to talk about, and Anastatia had not the courage\nto take him for himself. She had the world at her feet, and paid for\nit by being bound by its opinion.'\n\n\"Here my grandmother, who was apt to moralize, especially when\nrelating biographies of young ladies, gave another sigh.\n\n\"'Then why did she encourage him?' inquired Aunt Harriet; who also\nmoralized, but with more of indignation and less of philosophy.\n\n\"'I believe she loved him in spite of herself; but at the last, when\nhe offered, she turned prudent and refused him.'\n\n\"'Poor man! Did he ever marry?'\n\n\"'Yes, and very happily--a charming woman. But the strange part of the\nstory is, that he came quite unexpectedly into a large property that\nwas in his family.'\n\n\"'Did he? Then he would have been as good a match as most of her\nadmirers?'\n\n\"'Better. It was a fine estate. Poor Anastatia!'\n\n\"'Serve her right,' said my aunt, shortly.\n\n\"'She was very beautiful,' my grandmother gently recommenced. She said\nthis, not precisely as an excuse, but with something of the sort in\nher tone. 'Very beautiful! How stately she did look that night, to be\nsure! She did not paint, and her complexion (a shade too high by day)\nwas perfection by candlelight. I can see her now, my dear, as she\nstood up for a minuet with him. We wore hoops, then; and she had a\nwhite brocade petticoat, embroidered with pink rosebuds, and a train\nand bodice of pea-green satin, and green satin shoes with pink heels.\nYou never saw anything more lovely than that brocade. A rich old aunt\nhad given it to her. The shades of the rosebuds were exquisite. I\nembroidered the rosebuds on that salmon-coloured cushion downstairs\nfrom a piece that Anastatia gave me as a pattern. Dear me! What a\ndress it was, and how lovely she looked in it! Her eyes were black, a\nthing you rarely see, and they shone and glittered under her powdered\nhair. She had a delicately curved nose; splendid teeth, too, and\nshowed them when she smiled. Then such a lovely throat, and\nbeautifully-shaped arms! I don't know how it is, my dear Harriet,'\nadded my grandmother, thoughtfully, 'but you don't see the splendid\nwomen now-a-days that there were when I was young. There are plenty of\npretty, lively girls (rather too lively, in my old-fashioned\njudgment), but not the real stately beauty that it was worth a twenty\nmiles' drive there and back, just to see, at one of the old county\nballs.'\n\n\"My aunt sniffed, partly from a depressing consciousness of being one\nof a degenerate generation, and of a limited experience in the matter\nof county balls; partly also to express her conviction that principle\nis above beauty. She said:\n\n\"'Then Miss Eden married, ma'am?'\n\n\"'Yes, rather late, Mr. Moss; a wealthy Indian merchant, I believe.\nShe lost all her children, I know, one after another, and then he\ndied. Poor Anastatia! It seems like yesterday. And to think she should\nbe coming here!'\n\n\"My grandmother sighed again, and I held my breath, hoping for some\nfurther particulars of the lovely heroine of this romance. But I was\ndisappointed. My uncle's voice at this moment called loudly from\nbelow, and Aunt Harriet hurried off with a conscious meritoriousness\nabout her, becoming a lady who had married the right man, and took\ngreat care of him.\n\n\"'Supper, ma'am. I think,' she said, as she left the room.\n\n\"My grandmother sat still by the fire, sighing gently now and then,\nand I lay making up my mind to brave all and tell her that I was\nawake. In the first place (although I was not intentionally\neavesdropping, and my being awake was certainly not my fault), I felt\nrather uneasy at having overheard what I knew was not intended for my\nhearing. Besides this, I wanted to hear some more stories of the\nlovely Mrs. Moss, and to ask how soon she would come to the manor.\nAfter a few seconds my grandmother rose and toddled across the room.\nI made an effort, and spoke just above my breath:\n\n\"'Granny!'\n\n\"But my grandmother was rather deaf. Moreover, my voice may have been\ndrowned in the heavy sigh with which she closed the nursery door.\n\n\"The room was empty again; the glare of the red screen was tenderly\nsubdued in the firelight; but for all this I did not go to sleep. I\ntook advantage of my freedom to sit up in bed, toss my hair from my\nforehead, and clasping my knees with my arms, to rock myself and\nthink. My thoughts had one object; my whole mind was filled with one\nimage--Mrs. Moss. The future inhabitant of my dear deserted manor\nwould, in any circumstances, have been an interesting subject for my\nfancies. The favoured individual whose daily walk might be between the\nyew-hedges on that elastic lawn; who should eat, drink, and sleep\nthrough the commonplace hours of this present time behind those\nmystical white shutters! But when the individual added to this\nfelicitous dispensation of fortune the personal attributes of\nunparalleled beauty and pea-green satin; of having worn hoops, high\nheels, and powder; of countless lovers, and white brocade with pink\nrosebuds--well might I sit, my brain whirling with anticipation, as I\nthought: 'She is coming here: I shall see her!' For though, of\ncourse, I knew that having lived in those (so to speak) pre-historic\ntimes when my grandmother was young, Mrs. Moss must now be an old\nwoman; yet, strange as it may seem, my dear, I do assure you that I\nnever realized the fact. I thought of her as I had heard of her--young\nand beautiful--and modelled my hopes accordingly.\n\n\"Most people's day-dreams take, sooner or later, a selfish turn. I\nseemed to identify myself with the beautiful Anastatia. I thought of\nthe ball as one looks back to the past. I fancied myself moving\nthrough the _minuet de la cour_, whose stately paces scarcely made the\nsilken rosebuds rustle. I rejected _en masse_ countless suitors of\nfabulous wealth and nobility; but when it came to Mr. Sandford, I\ncould feel with Miss Eden no more. My grandmother had said that she\nloved him, that she encouraged him, and that she gave him up for\nmoney. It was a mystery! In her place, I thought, I would have danced\nevery dance with him! I would have knitted for him in winter, and\ngathered flowers for him in the summer hedges. To whom should one be\nmost kind, if not to those whom one most loves? To love, and take\npleasure in giving pain--to balance a true heart and clear blue eyes\nagainst money, and prefer money--was not at that time comprehensible\nby me. I pondered, and (so to speak) spread out the subject before my\nmind, and sat in judgment upon it.\n\n\"Money--that is, golden guineas (my grandmother had given me one on\nmy birthday), crowns, shillings, sixpences, pennies, halfpennies,\nfarthings; and when you come to consider how many things a guinea\njudiciously expended in a toy-shop will procure, you see that money is\na great thing, especially if you have the full control of it, and are\nnot obliged to spend it on anything useful.\n\n\"On the other hand, those whom you love and who love you--not in\nchildhood, thank God, the smallest part of one's acquaintance.\n\n\"I made a list on my own account. It began with my mother, and ended\nwith my yellow cat. (It included a crusty old gardener, who was at\ntimes, especially in the spring, so particularly cross that I _might_\nhave been tempted to exchange _him_ for the undisputed possession of\nthat stock of seeds, tools, and flower-pots which formed our chief\nsubject of dispute. But this is a digression.) I took the lowest.\nCould I part with Sandy Tom for any money, or for anything that money\ncould buy? I thought of a speaking doll, a miniature piano, a tiny\ncarriage drawn by four yellow mastiffs, of a fairy purse that should\nnever be empty, with all that might thereby be given to others or kept\nfor oneself: and then I thought of Sandy Tom--of his large, round,\nsoft head; his fine eyes (they were yellow, not blue, and glared with\ninfinite tenderness); his melodious purr; his expressive whiskers; his\nincomparable tail.\n\n\"Love rose up as an impulse, an instinct; it would not be doubted, it\nutterly refused to be spread out to question.\n\n\"'Oh, Puss?' I thought, 'if you could but leap on to the bed at this\nmoment I would explain it all to our mutual comprehension and\nsatisfaction. My dear Sandy,' I would say, 'with you to lie on the\ncushioned seat, a nice little carriage, and four yellow mastiffs,\nwould be perfection; but as to comparing what I love--to wit, you,\nSandy!--with what I want--to wit, four yellow mastiffs and a great\nmany other things besides--I should as soon think of cutting off your\ntail to dust the dolls' house with.' Alas! Sandy Tom was at home; I\ncould only imagine the gentle rub of the head with which he would have\nassented. Meanwhile, I made up my mind firmly on one point. My\ngrandmother was wrong. Miss Anastatia Eden had not loved Mr. Sandford.\n\n\"Smash! The fire, which had been gradually becoming hollow, fell in at\nthis moment, and I started to find myself chilly and cramped, and so\nlay down. Then my thoughts took another turn. I wondered if I should\ngrow up beautiful, like Mrs. Moss. It was a serious question. I had\noften looked at myself in the glass, but I had a general idea that I\nlooked much like other little girls of my age. I began gravely to\nexamine myself in detail, beginning from the top of my head. My hair\nwas light, and cropped on a level with the lobes of my ears; this,\nhowever, would amend itself with time; and I had long intended that my\nhair should be of raven blackness, and touch the ground at least; 'but\nthat will not be till I am grown up,' thought I. Then my eyes: they\nwere large; in fact, the undue proportions they assumed when I looked\nill or tired formed a family joke. If size were all that one requires\nin eyes, mine would certainly pass muster. Moreover, they had long\ncurly lashes. I fingered these slowly, and thought of Sandy's\nwhiskers. At this point I nearly fell asleep, but roused myself to\nexamine my nose. My grandmother had said that Mrs. Moss's nose was\ndelicately curved. Now, it is certainly true that a curve may be\neither concave or convex; but I had heard of the bridge of a nose, and\nknew well enough which way the curve should go; and I had a shrewd\nsuspicion that if so very short a nose as mine, with so much and so\nround a tip, could be said to be curved at all, the curve went the\nwrong way; at the same time I could not feel sure. For I must tell you\nthat to lie in a comfortable bed, at an hour long beyond the time when\none ought naturally to be asleep, and to stroke one's nose, is a\nproceeding not favourable to forming a clear judgment on so important\na point as one's personal appearance. The very shadows were still as\nwell as silent, the fire had ceased to flicker, a delicious quietude\npervaded the room, as I stroked my nose and dozed, and dozed and\nstroked my nose, and lost all sense of its shape, and fancied it a\nhuge lump growing under my fingers. The extreme unpleasantness of this\nidea just prevented my falling asleep; and I roused myself and sat up\nagain.\n\n\"'It's no use feeling,' I thought, 'I'll look in the glass.'\n\n\"There was one mirror in the room. It hung above the mantelpiece. It\nwas old, deeply framed in dark wood, and was so hung as to slope\nforwards into the room.\n\n\"In front of the fire stood an old-fashioned, cushioned arm-chair,\nwith a very high back, and a many-frilled chintz cover. A footstool\nlay near it. It was here that my grandmother had been sitting. I\njumped out of bed, put the footstool into the chair that I might get\nto a level with the glass, and climbed on to it. Thanks to the slope\nof the mirror, I could now see my reflection as well as the dim\nfirelight would permit.\n\n\"'What a silly child!' you will say, Ida. Very silly, indeed, my dear.\nAnd how one remembers one's follies! At the end of half a century, I\nrecall my reflection in that old nursery mirror more clearly than I\nremember how I looked in the glass before which I put on my bonnet\nthis evening to come to tea with you: the weird, startled glance of my\neyes, which, in their most prominent stage of weariness, gazed at me\nout of the shadows of the looking glass, the tumbled tufts of hair,\nthe ghostly effect of my white night-dress. As to my nose, I could\nabsolutely see nothing of its shape; the firelight just caught the\nround tip, which shone like a little white toadstool from the gloom,\nand this was all.\n\n\"'One can't see the shape, full face,' I thought. 'If I had only\nanother looking-glass.'\n\n\"But there was not another. I knew it, and yet involuntarily looked\nround the room. Suddenly I exclaimed aloud, 'Mr. Joseph will do!'\n\n\"Who was Mr. Joseph?--you will ask. My dear Ida, I really do not know.\nI have not the least idea. I had heard him called Mr. Joseph, and I\nfancy he was a connection of the family. All I knew of him was his\nportrait, a _silhouette_, elegantly glazed and framed in black wood,\nwhich hung against the nursery wall. I was ignorant of his surname and\nhistory. I had never examined his features. But I knew that happily he\nhad been very stout, since his ample coat and waistcoat, cut out in\nblack paper, converted the glass which covered them into an excellent\nmirror for my dolls.\n\n\"Worthy Mr. Joseph! Here he was coming in useful again. How much we\nowe to our forefathers! I soon unhooked him, and climbing back into\nthe chair, commenced an examination of my profile by the process of\ndouble reflection. But all in vain! Whether owing to the dusty state\nof the mirror, or to the dim light, or to the unobliging shapeliness\nof Mr. Joseph's person, I cannot say, but, turn and twist as I would,\nI could not get a view of my profile sufficiently clear and complete\nto form a correct judgment upon. I held Mr. Joseph, now high, now low;\nI stooped, I stood on tiptoe, I moved forward, I leant backward. It\nwas this latest manoeuvre that aggravated the natural topheaviness\nof the chair, and endangered its balance. The fore-legs rose, my\nspasmodic struggle was made in the wrong direction, and I, the\narm-chair, and Mr. Joseph fell backwards together.\n\n\"Two of us were light enough, and happily escaped unhurt. It was the\narm-chair which fell with such an appalling crash, and whether it were\nany the worse or no, I could not tell as it lay. As soon as I had a\nlittle recovered from the shock, therefore, I struggled to raise it,\nwhilst Mr. Joseph lay helplessly upon the ground, with his waistcoat\nturned up to the ceiling.\n\n\"It was thus that my aunt found us.\n\n\"If only Mr. Joseph and I had fallen together, no one need have been\nthe wiser; but that lumbering arm-chair had come down with a bump that\nstartled the sober trio at supper in the dining-room below.\n\n\"'What _is_ the matter?' said Aunt Harriet.\n\n\"I was speechless.\n\n\"'What have you been doing?'\n\n\"I couldn't speak; but accumulating misfortune was gradually\noverpowering me, and I began to cry.\n\n\"'Get into bed,' said Aunt Harriet.\n\n\"I willingly obeyed, and Aunt Harriet seated herself at the foot.\n\n\"'Now, think before you speak, Mary,' she said quietly, 'and then tell\nme the truth. What have you been doing?'\n\n\"One large tear rolled over my nose and off the tip as I feebly\nbegan--\n\n\"'I got into the chair--'\n\n\"'Well?' said Aunt Harriet.\n\n\"'--to look in the glass.'\n\n\"'What for?' said Aunt Harriet.\n\n\"Tears flowed unrestrainedly over my face as I howled in self-abasement--\n\n\"'To look at the shape of my nose.'\n\n\"At this point Aunt Harriet rose, and, turning her back rather\nabruptly, crossed the room, and picked up Mr. Joseph. (I have since\nhad reason to believe that she was with difficulty concealing a fit of\nlaughter.)\n\n\"'What have you had this picture down for?' she inquired, still with\nher back to me.\n\n\"'I couldn't see,' I sobbed, 'and I got Mr. Joseph to help me.'\n\n\"My aunt made no reply, and, still carefully concealing her face,\nrestored Mr. Joseph to his brass nail with great deliberation.\n\n\"There is nothing like full confession. I broke the silence.\n\n\"'Aunt Harriet, I was awake when you and Granny were here, and heard\nwhat you said.'\n\n\"'You are a very silly, naughty child,' my aunt severely returned.\n'Why don't you go to sleep when you are sent to bed?'\n\n\"'I can't,' I sobbed, 'with talking and candles.'\n\n\"'You've got the screen,' said Aunt Harriet; and I cannot tell why,\nbut somehow I lacked courage to say that the red screen was the chief\ninstrument of torture!\n\n\"'Well, go to sleep now,' she concluded, 'and be thankful you're not\nhurt. You might have killed yourself.'\n\n\"Encouraged by the gracious manner in which she tucked me up, I took a\nshort cut to the information which I had failed to attain through Mr.\nJoseph.\n\n\"'Aunt Harriet,' I said, 'do you think I shall ever be as beautiful as\nMrs. Moss?'\n\n\"'I'm ashamed of you,' said Aunt Harriet.\n\n\"I climbed no more into the treacherous arm-chair. I eschewed the\nmirror. I left Mr. Joseph in peace upon the wall. I took no further\ntrouble about the future prospects of my nose. But night and day I\nthought of Mrs. Moss. I found the old cushion, and sat by it, gazing\nat the faded tints of the rosebuds, till I imagined the stiff brocade\nin all its beauty and freshness. I took a vigorous drawing fit; but it\nwas only to fill my little book with innumerable sketches of Mrs.\nMoss. My uncle lent me his paint-box, as he was wont; and if the fancy\nportraits that I made were not satisfactory even to myself, they\nfailed in spite of cheeks blushing with vermilion, in spite of eyes as\nlarge and brilliant as lamp-black could make them, and in spite of the\nmost accurately curved noses that my pencil could produce. The amount\nof gamboge and Prussian blue that I wasted in vain efforts to produce\na satisfactory pea-green, leaves me at this day an astonished admirer\nof my uncle's patience. At this time I wished to walk along no other\nroad than that which led to my dear manor, where the iron gates were\nbeing painted, the garden made tidy, and the shutters opened; but,\nabove all, the chief object of my desires was to accompany my\ngrandmother and aunt in their first visit to Mrs. Moss.\n\n\"Once I petitioned Aunt Harriet on this subject. Her answer was--\n\n\"'My dear, there would be nothing to amuse you; Mrs. Moss is an old\nwoman.'\n\n\"'Granny said she was so beautiful,' I suggested.\n\n\"'So she was, my dear, when your grandmother was young.'\n\n\"These and similar remarks I heard and heeded not. They did not add\none wrinkle to my ideal of Mrs. Moss: they in no way whatever lessened\nmy desire of seeing her. I had never seen my grandmother young, and\nher having ever been so seemed to me at the most a matter of\ntradition; on the other hand, Mrs. Moss had been presented to my\nimagination in the bloom of youth and beauty, and, say what they\nwould, in the bloom of youth and beauty I expected to see her still.\n\n\"One afternoon, about a week after the arrival of Mrs. Moss, I was\nbusy in the garden, where I had been working for an hour or more, when\nI heard carriage wheels drive up and stop at our door. Could it be\nMrs. Moss? I stole gently round to a position where I could see\nwithout being seen, and discovered that the carriage was not that of\nany caller, but my uncle's. Then Granny and Aunt Harriet were going\nout. I rushed up to the coachman, and asked where they were going. He\nseemed in no way overpowered by having to reply--'To the manor, Miss.'\n\n\"That was to Mrs. Moss, and I was to be left behind! I stood\nspeechless in bitter disappointment, as my grandmother rustled out in\nher best silk dress, followed by Aunt Harriet and my uncle, who, when\nhe saw me, exclaimed:\n\n\"'Why, there's my little Mary! Why don't you take her? I'll be bound\nshe wants to go.'\n\n\"'I do, indeed!' I exclaimed, in Cinderella-like tones.\n\n\"'But Mrs. Moss is such an old lady,' said Aunt Harriet, whose ideas\nupon children were purely theoretical, and who could imagine no\ninterests for them apart from other children, from toys or definite\namusements--'What could the child do with herself?'\n\n\"'Do!' said my uncle, who took a rough and cheery view of life, 'why,\nlook about her, to be sure. And if Mrs. M. is an old lady, there'll be\nall the more Indian cabinets and screens, and japanned tables, and\nknick-knacks, and lap-dogs. Keep your eyes open, Miss Mary. I've never\nseen the good lady or her belongings, but I'll stake my best hat on\nthe japan ware and the lap-dog. Now, how soon can you be dressed?'\n\n\"Later in life the selfish element mixes more largely with our\nadmirations. A few years thence, and in a first interview with the\nobject of so many fancies, I should have thought as much of my own\nappearance on the occasion, as of what I was myself to see. I should\nhave taken some pains with my toilette. At that time, the desire to\nsee Mrs. Moss was too absorbing to admit of any purely personal\nconsiderations. I dashed into the nursery, scrubbed my hands and face\nto a raw red complexion, brushed my hair in three strokes, and secured\nmy things with one sweep. I hastily pocketed a pincushion of red\ncloth, worked with yellow silk spots, in the likeness of a strawberry.\nIt was a pet treasure of mine, and I intended it as an offering to\nMrs. Moss. I tied my hood at the top of the stairs, fastened my tippet\nin the hall, and reached the family coach by about three of those\nbounds common to all young animals.\n\n\"'Halloa!' said my uncle, with his face through the carriage door.\n'You've not thanked me yet.'\n\n\"I flung my arms round his starched neck-cloth.\n\n\"'You're a darling!' I exclaimed, with an emphatic squeeze.\n\n\"'You're another,' he replied, returning the embrace upon my hood.\n\n\"With this mutual understanding we parted, and I thought that if Mrs.\nMoss were not certain to fulfil my ideal, I should have wished her to\nbe as nearly like Uncle James as the circumstances of the case would\npermit. I watched his yellow waistcoat and waving hands till they\ncould be seen no longer, and then I settled myself primly upon the\nback seat, and ventured upon a shy conciliating promise to be 'very\ngood.'\n\n\"'You're quite welcome to come, child,' said Aunt Harriet; 'but as I\nsaid, there are neither children nor playthings for you.'\n\n\"Children or playthings! What did I want with either? I put my arm\nthrough the loop by the window and watched the fields as they came and\nvanished, with vacant eyes, and thought of Mrs. Moss. A dozen times\nhad I gone through the whole scene in my mind before we drove through\nthe iron gates. I fancied myself in the bare, spacious hall, at which\nI had peeped; I seemed to hear a light laugh, and to see the beautiful\nface of Mrs. Moss look over the banisters; to hear a rustle, and the\nscraping of the stiff brocade, as the pink rosebuds shimmered, and the\ngreen satin shoes peeped out, and tap, tap, tap, the high pink heels\nresounded from the shallow stairs.\n\n\"I had dreamed this day-dream many times over before the carriage\nstopped with a shake, and Aunt Harriet roused me, asking if I were\nasleep. In another minute or so we were in the hall, and here I met\nwith my first disappointment.\n\n\"To begin with, I had seen the hall unfurnished, and had not imagined\nit otherwise. I had pictured Mrs. Moss in her beauty and rose brocade,\nthe sole ornament of its cold emptiness. Then (though I knew that my\ngrandmother and aunt must both be present) I had really fancied myself\nthe chief character in this interview with Mrs. Moss. I had thought of\nmyself as rushing up the stairs to meet her, and laying the pincushion\nat her green satin feet. And now that at last I was really in the\nhall, I should not have known it again. It was carpeted from end to\nend. Fragrant orange-trees stood in tubs, large hunting-pictures hung\nupon the walls, below which stood cases of stuffed birds, and over all\npresided a footman in livery, who himself looked like a stuffed\nspecimen of the human race with unusually bright plumage.\n\n\"No face peeped over the banisters, and when we went upstairs, the\nfootman went first (as seemed due to him), then my grandmother,\nfollowed by my aunt, and lastly I, in the humblest insignificance,\nbehind them. My feet sank into the soft stair-carpets, I vacantly\nadmired the elegant luxury around me, with an odd sensation of\nheartache. Everything was beautiful, but I had wanted nothing to be\nbeautiful but Mrs. Moss.\n\n\"Already the vision began to fade. That full-fed footman troubled my\nfancies. His scarlet plush killed the tender tints of the rosebuds in\nmy thoughts, and the streaky powder upon his hair seemed a mockery of\nthe _toupêe_ I hoped to see, whose whiteness should enhance the lustre\nof rare black eyes. He opened the drawing-room door and announced my\ngrandmother and aunt. I followed, and (so far as one may be said to\nface anything when one stands behind the skirts of two intervening\nelders) I was face to face with Mrs. Moss.\n\n\"That is, I was face to face with a tall, dark, old woman, with\nstooping shoulders, a hooked nose, black eyes that smouldered in their\nsunken sockets, and a distinct growth of beard upon her chin. Mr. Moss\nhad been dead many years, and his widow had laid aside her weeds. She\nwore a dress of _feuille-morte_ satin, and a black lace shawl. She had\na rather elaborate cap, with a tendency to get on one side, perhaps\nbecause it would not fit comfortably on the brown front with bunchy\ncurls which was fastened into its place by a band of broad black\nvelvet.\n\n\"And this was Mrs. Moss! This was the end of all my fancies! There was\nnothing astonishing in the disappointment; the only marvel was that I\nshould have indulged in so foolish a fancy for so long. I had been\ntold more than once that Mrs. Moss was nearly as old as my\ngrandmother. As it was, she looked older. Why--I could not tell then,\nthough I know now.\n\n\"My grandmother, though never a beauty, had a sweet smile of her own,\nand a certain occasional kindling of the eyes, the outward signs of a\ncharacter full of sentiment and intelligence; and these had outlasted\nyouth. She had always been what is called 'pleasing,' and she was\npleasing still. But in Mrs. Moss no strength, no sentiment, no\nintellect filled the place of the beauty that was gone. Features that\nwere powerful without character, and eyes that glowed without\nexpression, formed a wreck with little to recall the loveliness that\nhad bewildered Mr. Sandford--and me.\n\n\"There is not much more to tell, Ida. This was the disappointment.\nThis is the cause of my dislike for a certain shade of _feuille-morte_\nsatin. It disappointed me of that rose brocade which I was never to\nsee. You shall hear how I got through the visit, however. This\nmeeting, which (like so many meetings) had proved the very reverse of\nwhat was hoped.\n\n\"Through an angle of Aunt Harriet's pelisse, I watched the meeting\nbetween my grandmother and Mrs. Moss. They kissed and then drew back\nand looked at each other, still holding hands. I wondered if my\ngrandmother felt as I felt. I could not tell. With one of her smiles,\nshe bent forward, and, kissing Mrs. Moss again, said:\n\n\"'God bless you, Anastatia.'\n\n\"'God bless you, Elizabeth.'\n\n\"It was the first time Mrs. Moss had spoken, and her voice was rather\ngruff. Then both ladies sat down, and my grandmother drew out her\npocket-handkerchief and wiped her eyes. Mrs. Moss began (as I thought)\nto look for hers, and, not finding it, called,\n\n\"'Metcalfe!'\n\n\"on which a faded little woman, with a forefinger in a faded-looking\nbook, came out from behind some window-curtains, and, rummaging Mrs.\nMoss's chair with a practised hand, produced a large silver\nsnuff-box, from which Mrs. Moss took a pinch, and then offered it to\nGranny, who shook her head. Mrs. Moss took another and a larger pinch.\nIt was evident what made her voice so gruff.\n\n\"Aunt Harriet was introduced as 'My daughter Harriet,' and made a\nstiff curtsey as Mrs. Moss smiled, and nodded, and bade her 'sit down,\nmy dear.' Throughout the whole interview she seemed to be looked upon\nby both ladies as a child, and played the part so well, sitting prim\nand silent on her chair, that I could hardly help humming as I looked\nat her:\n\n    'Hold up your head,\n    Turn out your toes,\n    Speak when you're spoken to,\n    Mend your clothes.'\n\n\"I was introduced, too, as 'a grandchild,' made a curtsey the shadow of\nAunt Harriet's, received a nod, the shadow of that bestowed upon her,\nand got out of the way as soon as I could, behind my aunt's chair,\nwhere, coming unexpectedly upon three fat pug-dogs on a mat, I sat\ndown among them and felt quite at home.\n\n\"The sight of the pugs brought Uncle James to my mind, and when I\nlooked round the room, it seemed to me that he must be a conjuror at\nleast, so true was everything he had said. A large Indian screen hid\nthe door; japanned boxes stood on a little table to correspond in\nfront of it, and there were two cabinets having shallow drawers with\ndecorated handles, and a great deal of glass, through which odd\nteacups, green dragons, Indian gods, and Dresden shepherdesses were\nvisible upon the shelves. The room was filled with knick-knacks, and\nhere were the pug-dogs, no less than three of them! They were very\nfat, and had little beauty except as to their round heads and black\nwrinkled snouts, which I kissed over and over again.\n\n\"'Do you mind Mrs. Moss's being old, and dressing in that hideous\nbrown dress?' I asked in a whisper at the ear of one of these round\nheads. 'Think of the rosebuds on the brocade, and the pea-green satin,\nand the high-heeled shoes. Ah!' I added, 'you are only a pug, and pugs\ndon't think.' Nevertheless, I pulled out the pincushion, and showed it\nto each dog in turn, and the sight of it so forcibly reminded me of my\nvain hopes, that I could not help crying. A hot tear fell upon the\nnose of the oldest and fattest pug, which so offended him that he\nmoved away to another mat at some distance, and as both the others\nfell fast asleep, I took refuge in my own thoughts.\n\n\"The question arose why should not Mrs. Moss have the pincushion\nafter all? I had expected her to be young and beautiful, and she had\nproved old and ugly, it is true; but there is no reason why old and\nugly people should not have cushions to keep their pins in. It was a\nstruggle to part with my dear strawberry pincushion in the\ncircumstances, but I had fairly resolved to do so, when the rustle of\nleave-taking began, and I had to come out of my corner.\n\n\"'Bid Mrs. Moss good-day, Mary,' said my grandmother; and added, 'the\nchild has been wild to come and see you, Anastatia.'\n\n\"Mrs. Moss held out her hand good-naturedly. 'So you wanted to see me,\nmy dear?' said she.\n\n\"I took my hand out of my pocket, where I had been holding the\npincushion, and put both into Mrs. Moss's palm.\n\n\"'I brought this for you ma'am,' I said. 'It is not a real strawberry;\nit is emery; I made it myself.'\n\n\"And the fact of having sacrificed something for Mrs. Moss made me\nalmost fond of her. Moreover, there was an expression in her eyes at\nthat moment which gave them beauty. She looked at my grandmother and\nlaid her hand on my head.\n\n\"'I lost all mine, Elizabeth.'\n\n\"I thought she was speaking of her pincushions, and being in a\ngenerous mood, said hastily,\n\n\"When that is worn out, ma'am, I will make you another.'\n\n\"But she was speaking of her children. Poor Mrs. Moss! She took\nanother huge pinch of snuff, and called, 'Metcalfe.'\n\n\"The faded little woman appeared once more.\n\n\"'I must give you a keepsake in return, my dear,' said Mrs. Moss. 'The\nchina pug, Metcalfe!'\n\n\"Metcalfe (whose face always wore a smile that looked as if it were\njust about to disappear, and who, indeed, for that matter, always\nlooked as if she were just about to disappear herself) opened one of\nthe cabinets, and brought out a little toy pug in china, very\ndelicately coloured, and looking just like one of my friends on the\nmat. I fell in love with it at once, and it was certainly a handsome\nexchange for the strawberry pincushion.\n\n\"'You will send the child to see me now and then, Elizabeth?' said\nMrs. Moss as we retired.\n\n\"In the end Mrs. Moss and I became great friends. I put aside my dream\namong the 'vain fancies' of life, and took very kindly to the manor in\nits new aspect. Even the stuffed footman became familiar, and learnt\nto welcome me with a smile. The real Mrs. Moss was a more agreeable\nperson than I have, I fear, represented her. She had failed to grasp\nsolid happiness in life, because she had chosen with the cowardice of\nan inferior mind; but she had borne disappointment with dignity, and\nsubmitted to heavy sorrows with patience; and a greater nature could\nnot have done more. She was the soul of good humour, and the love of\nsmall chat, which contrasted so oddly with her fierce appearance, was\na fund of entertainment for me, as I fed my imagination and stored my\nmemory with anecdotes of the good old times in the many quiet evenings\nwe spent together. I learnt to love her more heartily, I confess, when\nshe bought a new gown and gave the _feuille-morte_ satin to Mrs.\nMetcalfe.\n\n\"Mrs. Metcalfe was 'humble companion' to Mrs. Moss. She was in reality\nsingle, but she exacted the married title as a point of respect. At\nthe beginning of our acquaintance I called her 'Miss Metcalfe,' and\nthis occasioned the only check our friendship ever received. Now I\nwould, with the greatest pleasure, have addressed her as 'My Lord\nArchbishop,' or in any other style to which she was not entitled, it\nbeing a matter of profound indifference to me. But the question was a\nserious one to her, and very serious she made it, till I almost\ndespaired of our ever coming to an understanding on the subject.\n\n\"On every other point she was unassuming almost to non-entity. She was\nweak-minded to the verge of mental palsy. She was more benevolent in\ndeed, and more wandering in conversation, than any one I have met with\nsince. That is, in ordinary life. In the greenhouse or garden (with\nwhich she and the head-gardener alone had any real acquaintance) her\naccurate and profound knowledge would put to shame many professed\ngarden botanists I have met with since. From her I learnt what little\nI know of the science of horticulture, and with her I spent many happy\nhours over the fine botanical works in the manor library, which she\nalone ever opened.\n\n\"And so I became reconciled to things as they were, though to this day\nI connect with that shade of _feuille-morte_ satin a disappointment\nnot to be forgotten.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is a dull story, is it not, Ida?\" said the little old lady,\npausing here. She had not told it in precisely these words, but this\nwas the sum and substance of it.\n\nIda nodded. Not that she had thought the story dull, so far as she had\nheard it, and whilst she was awake; but she had fallen asleep, and so\nshe nodded.\n\nMrs. Overtheway looked back at the fire, to which, indeed, she had\nbeen talking for some time past.\n\n\"A child's story?\" she thought. \"A tale of the blind, wilful folly of\nchildhood? Ah, my soul! Alas, my grown-up friends! Does the moral\nbelong to childhood alone? Have manhood and womanhood no passionate,\nfoolish longings, for which we blind ourselves to obvious truth, and\nof which the vanity does not lessen the disappointment? Do we not\nstill toil after rosebuds, to find _feuilles-mortes_?\"\n\nNo voice answered Mrs. Overtheway's fanciful questions. The hyacinth\nnodded fragrantly on its stalk, and Ida nodded in her chair. She was\nfast asleep--happily asleep--with a smile upon her face.\n\nThe shadows nodded gently on the walls, and like a shadow the little\nold lady stole quietly away.\n\nWhen Ida awoke, she found herself lying partly in the arm-chair, and\npartly in the arms of Nurse, who was lifting her up. A candle flared\nupon the table, by the fire stood an empty chair, and the heavy scent\nthat filled the room was as sweet as the remembrance of past\nhappiness. The little old lady had vanished, and, but for the\nhyacinth, Ida would almost have doubted whether her visit had not been\na dream.\n\n\"Has Mrs. Overtheway been long gone, Nursey?\" she asked, keeping her\neyes upon the flowerpot.\n\n\"Ever so long!\" said Nurse, \"and here you've been snoring away, and\nthe old lady's been downstairs, telling me how comfortably you were\nasleep, and she's coming again to-morrow evening, if you're good.\"\n\nIt was precisely twelve minutes since Mrs. Overtheway left the house,\nbut Nurse was of a slightly exaggerative turn of mind, and few people\nspeak exactly on the subject of time, especially when there is an\nopportunity of triumphing over someone who has been asleep before\nbed-time. The condition of Ida's being good was also the work of\nNurse's own instructive fancy, but Ida caught eagerly at the welcome\nnews of another visit.\n\n\"Then she is not angry with me for falling asleep, Nursey? I was so\ncomfortable, and she has such a nice voice, I couldn't help it; I\nthink I left off about the pugs. I wish I had a pug with a wrinkled\nblack snout, don't you, Nursey?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't, Miss Ida. My father kept all sorts of pigs, and we\nused to have one with a black snout and black spots, but it was as\nugly as ugly could be; and I never could fancy the bacon would be fit\nto eat. You must have been dreaming, I'm sure; the old lady would\nnever tell you about such rubbish, I know.\"\n\n\"It's pugs, not pigs, Nursey; and they're dogs, you know,\" said Ida,\nlaughing. \"How funny you are! And indeed she did tell me, I couldn't\nhave dreamt it; I never dreamt anything so nice in my life.\"\n\n\"And never will, most likely,\" said Nurse, who was very skilful in\nconcluding a subject which she did not want to discuss, and who was\napt to do so by a rapid twist in the line of argument, which Ida would\nfind somewhat bewildering. \"But, dear Miss Ida,\" she continued, \"do\nleave off clutching at that chair-arm, when I'm lifting you up; and\nyour eyes 'll drop out of your head, if you go on staring like that.\"\n\nIda relaxed the nervous grasp, to which she had been impelled by her\nenergy on the subject of the pugs, let down her eyebrows, and\nsubmitted to be undressed. The least pleasant part of this ceremony\nmay be comprised in the word curl-papers. Ida's hair was dark, and\nsoft, and smooth, but other little girls wore ringlets, and so this\nlittle girl must wear ringlets too. To that end her hair was every\nnight put into curl-papers, with much tight twisting and sharp\njerking, and Ida slept upon an irregular layer of small paper parcels,\nwhich made pillows a mockery. With all this, however, a damp day, or a\ngood romp, would sometimes undo the night's work, to the great disgust\nof Nurse. In her last place, the young lady's hair had curled with a\ndamp brush, as Ida well knew, and Nurse made so much of her own\ngrievance, in having to use the curl-papers, that no place was left\nfor Ida's grievance in having to sleep upon them. She submitted this\nnight therefore, as other nights, in patience, and sat swinging her\nfeet and accommodating her head to the sharp tugs, which always seemed\nto come from unexpected quarters. Perhaps, however, her mind may have\nbeen running a little upon grievances, which made her say:\n\n\"You know, Nursey, how you are always telling me I ought to be\nthankful for having things, and not having things, and--\"\n\n\"I wish you'd talk sense, and not give way with your head so when I\npull, Miss Ida,\" retorted Nurse, \"having things, and not having\nthings; I don't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, Nursey, the other day when I said I didn't like\nbread-and-treacle treacled so long before, and soaked in, and you said\nI ought to be thankful that I had bread-and-treacle at all, and that I\nhadn't a wooden leg, and to eat anything I could get, like the old\nsailor man at the corner; well, do you know, I've thought of something\nI _am_ so thankful for, and that is that I haven't a red screen to my\nbed.\"\n\n\"I really do think, Miss Ida,\" said Nurse, \"that you'll go out of your\nmind some day, with your outlandish fancies. And where you get them, I\ncan't think. I'm sure _I_ never put such things into your head.\"\n\nIda laughed again.\n\n\"Never mind, Nursey, it all belongs to the pug story. Am I done now?\nAnd when you've tucked me up, please, would you mind remembering to\nput the flower where I can see it when I wake?\"\n\nNurse did as she was asked, and Ida watched the hyacinth till she fell\nasleep; and she slept well.\n\nIn the morning she took her old post at the window. The little old\nlady had never seemed so long in making her appearance, nor the bells\nso slow to begin. Chim! chime! chim! chime! There they were at last,\nand there was Mrs. Overtheway. She looked up, waved a bunch of\nsnowdrops, and went after the bells. Ida kissed her hand, and waved it\nover and over again, long after the little old lady was out of sight.\n\n\"There's a kiss for you, dear Mrs. Overtheway,\" she cried, \"and kisses\nfor your flowers, and your house, and everything belonging to you, and\nfor the bells and the church, and everybody in it this morning, and--\"\n\nBut, at this point of universal benevolence, Nurse carried her off to\nbreakfast.\n\nThe little old lady came to tea as before. She looked as well as ever,\nand Nurse was equally generous in the matter of tea and toast. Mrs.\nOvertheway told over again what Ida had missed in the story of Mrs.\nMoss, and Ida apologized, with earnest distress, for her uncivil\nconduct in falling asleep.\n\n\"There I was snoring away, when you were telling me such a delightful\nstory!\" she exclaimed, penitently.\n\n\"Not snoring exactly, my dear,\" smiled the little old lady, \"but you\nlooked very happy.\"\n\n\"I thought Nursey said so,\" said Ida. \"Well, I'm very glad. It would\nhave been too rude. And you know I don't know how it was, for I _am_\nso fond of stories; I like nothing so well.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I try again?\" said Mrs. Overtheway. \"Perhaps I may find a\nmore amusing one, and if it does put you to sleep, it won't do any\nharm. Indeed, I think the doctor will say I'm very good company for\nyou.\"\n\n\"You are very good! That _I_ can tell him,\" said Ida, fervently, \"and\nplease let it be about yourself again, if you can remember anything. I\nlike true stories.\"\n\n\"Talking of snoring,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, \"reminds me of something\nthat happened in my youth, and it is true, though, do you know, it is\na ghost story.\"\n\nIda danced in her chair.\n\n\"That is just what I should like!\" she exclaimed. \"Nurse has a ghost\nstory, belonging to a farm-house, which she tells the housemaid, but\nshe says she can't tell me till I am older, and I should so like to\nhear a ghost story, if it isn't too horrid.\"\n\n\"This ghost story isn't too horrid, I think,\" laughed the little old\nlady, \"and if you will let me think a few minutes, and then forgive my\nprosy way of telling it, you shall have it at once.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The little old lady sat silent, and so sat Ida\nalso, with her eyes intently fixed on Mrs. Overtheway's face, over\nwhich an occasional smile was passing.\n\n\"It's about a ghost who snored,\" said the little old lady, doubtfully.\n\n\"Delicious!\" responded Ida. The two friends settled themselves\ncomfortably, and in some such words as these was told the following\nstory:--\n\n\n\n\nTHE SNORING GHOST.\n\n     _Clown._ Madman, thou errest: I say there is no darkness but\n     Ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians\n     in their fog....

I think nobly of the soul, and in no way approve\n     his opinion.\n\n     _Twelfth Night_, iv. 2.\n\n\n\"I remember,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, \"I remember my first visit. That\nis, I remember the occasion when I and my sister Fatima did, for the\nfirst time in our lives, go out visiting without our mother, or any\ngrown-up person to take care of us.\"\n\n\"Do you remember your mother?\" asked Ida.\n\n\"Quite well, my dear, I am thankful to say. The best and kindest of\nmothers!\"\n\n\"Was your father alive, too?\" Ida asked, with a sigh.\n\nThe old lady paused, pitying the anxious little face opposite, but\nIda went on eagerly:\n\n\"Please tell me what _he_ was like.\"\n\n\"He was a good deal older than my mother, who had married very early.\nHe was a very learned man. His tastes and accomplishments were many\nand various, and he was very young-hearted and enthusiastic in the\npursuit of them all his life. He was apt to take up one subject of\ninterest after another, and to be for the time completely absorbed in\nit. And, I must tell you, that whatever the subject might be, so long\nas his head was full of it, the house seemed full of it too. It\ninfluenced the conversation at meals, the habits of the household, the\nnames of the pet animals, and even of the children. I was called Mary,\nin a fever of chivalrous enthusiasm for the fair and luckless Queen of\nScotland, and Fatima received her name when the study of Arabic had\nbrought about an eastern mania. My father had wished to call her\nShahrazád, after the renowned sultana of the 'Arabian Nights' but when\nhe called upon the curate to arrange for the baptism, that worthy man\nflatly rebelled. A long discussion ended in my father's making a list\nof eastern names, from which the curate selected that of Fatima as\nbeing least repugnant to the sobriety of the parish registers. So\nFatima she was called, and as she grew up pale, and moon-faced, and\ndark-eyed, the name became her very well.\"\n\n\"Was it this Fatima who went out visiting with you?\" asked Ida.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; and now as to the visit. The invitation came on my\nthirteenth birthday.\n\n\"One's birthday is generally a day of some importance. A very notable\nday whilst one is young, but less so when one is old, when one is\nbeing carried quickly through the last stages of life, and when it\nseems hardly worth while to count time so near the end of the journey.\nEven in youth, however some birthdays are more important than others.\nI remember looking forward to my tenth birthday as to a high point of\ndignity and advancement; and the just pride of the occasion on which I\nfirst wrote my age with more figures than one. With similar feelings,\nI longed to be thirteen. The being able to write my age with two\nfigures had not, after all, shed any special lustre upon life; but\nwhen I was 'in my teens' it must 'feel different somehow.' So I\nthought. Moreover, this birthday was really to bring with it solid\nadvantages. I was now to be allowed to read certain books of a more\ngrown-up character than I had read hitherto, and to sit up till nine\no'clock. I was to wear sandals to my shoes. My hair was henceforth to\ngrow as long as I and the Fates would permit, and the skirts of my\nfrocks were to take an inch in the same direction. 'In four more\nyears,' I said to Fatima, as we sat on the eve of my birthday,\ndiscussing its manifold advantages, 'in four more years I shall be\ngrown up. Miss Ansted was introduced at seventeen.' The prospect was\nillimitable.\n\n\"'Do people always grow much on their birthdays?' asked one of the\nlittle ones. I had boasted in the nursery, that when I was thirteen I\nshould be 'nearly grown up,' and I myself had hardly outlived the idea\nthat on one's birthday one was a year older than on the previous day,\nand might naturally expect to have made a year's growth during the\nnight.\n\n\"This birthday, however, produced no such striking change. As usual,\nthe presents were charming; the wreath as lovely as Fatima's deft\nfingers could make it, the general holiday and pleasure-making almost\ntoo much of a good thing. Otherwise, there was little to mark it from\nother days in the year.\n\n\"Towards evening we were all sitting on the grass, the boys with their\nheads on the sisters' laps, and there had been an outcry for a story,\nto which no one had responded; partly, perhaps, because the exquisite\nair of evening seemed a sufficient delight, the stillness too profound\nto be lightly disturbed. We had remained for some time without\nspeaking, and the idea was becoming general among the girls that the\nboys were napping, when the summer silence was broken by the distant\nfootfalls of a horse upon the high road.\n\n\"'Trotting!' observed one of the supposed sleepers. We were not, as a\nfamily, given to explanations, and we drew a few more breaths of the\nevening air in silence. Then someone said:\n\n\"'We might make a story out of _that_, and fancy all sorts of things.\nWho is it? Where does he come from, and where is he going to?'\n\n\"'It is a messenger from the seat of war,' drawled the boy in my lap,\nwithout moving. Then, lifting his curly head for a moment, he cried,\n'To horse! gentlemen, to horse! The enemy will be at Carter's Mill by\nmidnight!'\n\n\"There was a pause; the solitary footfalls came nearer through the\nevening mists, and a small brother, of a quaint turn of mind, much\ngiven to the study of the historical portions of the Old Testament,\nsat up and said, slowly:\n\n\"'It is one of Job's messengers. _The Chaldeans made out three bands,\nand fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain\nthe servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone\nto tell thee._'\n\n\"The others boys laughed, but he lay down again, as solemnly as he had\nrisen.\n\n\"'That was a foot-messenger,' said my boy, contemptuously.\n\n\"'It doesn't say so,' retorted the small brother.\n\n\"'Well, any way, the camels had been carried off--so what did he ride\nupon?'\n\n\"A squabble was imminent. I covered my boy's face with a handkerchief,\nto keep him quiet.\n\n\"'Listen!' I said. 'It's the post. The mail from the north was stopped\non the highway, but he has saved the bags, and is riding hard for\nLondon.'\n\n\"'It's--'\n\n\"But the new suggestion was drowned in a general shout of--\n\n\"'It's coming up the lane!'\n\n\"The footfalls had diverged from the main road, and were coming up the\nsandy lane that skirted our wall. The boys lifted their heads, and we\nsat expectant. There was a pause, and a familiar gate-click, and then\nthe footfalls broke upon the carriage-road, close by us. A man in\nlivery, upon a well-groomed horse--nothing more, but rather an\nuncommon sight with us. Moreover, the man and his livery were strange,\nand the horse looked tired.\n\n\"This event broke up the sitting, and we were strolling up to the\nhouse, when a maid met us, saying that my mother wished to see me and\nFatima.\n\n\"We found my mother sewing, with an opened letter beside her. It was\nwritten on one of the large quarto sheets then in use, and it was\ncovered and crossed, at every available corner, in a vague, scratchy\nhand.\n\n\"'I have heard from an old friend of mine, Mary,' said my mother.\n'She has come to live about twelves miles from here. There is\nsomething in the letter about you and Fatima, and you may read that\npart aloud, if you can. The top of the last page.'\n\n\"I found the place, and, with some difficulty, deciphered: 'The dear\nMajor was all delicacy and consideration--'\n\n\"'No, no!' said my mother, 'the next sentence.'\n\n\"'Dear Cecilia was all sweetness. The dress was--'\n\n\"My mother took the letter, and found the right place herself, and\nthen I read:\n\n\"'If you cannot come yourself, at least let us renew acquaintance in\nour children. I think you have two girls about thirteen? My Lucy, a\ndear child just fifteen, feels keenly the loss of her only sister, and\nsome young companions would be a boon, as all our company will be\n_elders_. Pray send them. They can come by the coach, and shall be met\nat Durnford, at the Elephant and Castle.'\n\n\"'Is the other sister dead?' asked Fatima, pityingly, when we had\ndiscussed our personal interest in the subject.\n\n\"'Oh, no! only married,' said my mother.\n\n\"It was decided that we should go. This decision was not arrived at at\nonce, or without some ups and downs. My mother could not go herself,\nand had some doubts as to our being old enough, as yet, to go out\nvisiting alone. It will be believed that I made much of being able to\nsay--'But you know, I am thirteen, now.'\n\n\"Next day, in the evening, my father was busy in his study, and my\nmother sat at the open window, with Fatima and me at her feet. The\nletter of acceptance had been duly sent by the messenger, but she had\nyet a good deal of advice to give, and some doubts to express. She was\none of those people who cannot sit with idle fingers, and as she\ntalked she knitted. We found it easy enough to sit idle upon two\nlittle footstools, listening to the dear kind voice, and watching two\nlittle clouds, fragments of a larger group, which had detached\nthemselves, and were sailing slowly and alone across the heavens.\n\n\"'They are like us two,' Fatima had whispered to me; 'perhaps they are\ngoing to see some other clouds.'\n\n\"'I have observed two things which are apt to befall young people who\ngo out visiting,' said my mother, as she turned a row in her knitting,\n'one is, that they neglect little good habits while they are away, and\nthe other is, that they make themselves very disagreeable when they\ncome back.'\n\n\"The clouds drifted on, and my mother continued her knitting, arming\nus with many wise counsels on small matters connected with this great\nevent; to which Fatima and I gratefully gave half our minds, whilst\nwith the other half we made rosy pictures of unparalleled excellence\nunder trying circumstances, by which, hereafter, we should prove these\nwarnings and counsels to have been, in our case, unnecessary and\nsuperfluous.\n\n\"'Most families and most people,' said my mother, 'have little good\nhabits and customs of their own which they feel bound to keep,\nalthough they are not among the great general duties which bind every\none. So long as young people are at home, these matters are often\nsimple enough, but when they go away certain difficulties arise. They\ngo amongst people whose little habits are not the same as those to\nwhich they have been accustomed. Sometimes they come to very\nuncharitable conclusions upon their friends' characters in\nconsequence. And, I must say, that I have never met with any one who\ncould be more severe than young people of your age are apt to be. I\nremember it of myself, and I have seen it in so many other girls. Home\nis naturally the standard, and whatever is different seems wrong. As\nlife goes on, these young critics learn (or should learn) to\ndistinguish between general and particular duties; and also coming to\nknow a larger number of people, they find that all good persons are\nnot cut to the same pattern, and that one's friends' little ways are\nnot therefore absurd, because one does not happen to be used to them.\nOn the other hand, if going amongst other people may tempt you to be\ncritical of their little habits, it is also apt to make you neglect\nyour own. Perhaps you think this cannot much matter, as they are not\nthe great duties, and as other people seem to get on quite well\nwithout them. But one learns in the end, that no character of any\nvalue is formed without the discipline of individual rules, and that\nrules are of no use that are not held to against circumstances.\n“Charitable to others, severe to himself,” seems a maxim for grown-up\npeople in grown-up things; but, I believe, my little daughters, that\nthe doubts and difficulties of life begin very early, earlier than\nthey are commonly provided against; I think that innumerable girls\nstruggle miserably in the practice of duty, from a radical ignorance\nof its principles, and that the earlier these are learnt, the smaller\nis the burden of regret one heaps together to oppress the future, and\nthe sooner one finds that peace of mind which is not common even\namongst the young, and should-be light-hearted.'\n\n\"In these, or words to this effect, my dear mother prepared us for our\nfirst plunge into society. We discussed the little good habits we were\nto maintain, and, amongst others, certain little Sunday customs--for\nwe were to be away for a week.\n\n\"'We can't take all our good habits with us, if you won't come,' I\nsaid. 'What is to become of the Sunday readings?'\n\n\"For my mother used to read to us every Sunday evening, and we were\njust in the middle of that book of wondrous fascination--'The\nPilgrim's Progress.'\n\n\"'If it were not for the others, and if you would trust us with it,'\nsaid Fatima, thoughtfully, 'we might take the book with us, and Mary\nmight read to me, if she would--I like her reading.'\n\n\"My mother consented. There was another copy in the house, and though\nthis volume was a favourite, she said it was time we learnt to take\ncare of valuable books. So it was settled. We talked no more that\nevening; and the clouds drifted out of sight.\n\n\"'They have gone to bed in a big dark cloud on the other side' said\nFatima, yawning; and we went to bed also.\n\n\"My story wanders, Ida; this is because it is an old woman's tale. Old\npeople of my age become prosy, my dear. They love to linger over\nlittle remembrances of youth, and to recall the good counsels of kind\nvoices long silent. But I must not put you to sleep a second time, so\nI will not describe the lists of good habits which Fatima and I drew\nup in fine Roman characters, and which were to be kept as good\nresolutions had never been kept before. We borrowed the red ink, to\nmake them the more impressive to the eye, and, unfortunately, spilt\nit. A bad beginning, as many of our rules had reference to tidiness.\nNeither will I give you the full account of how we packed. How our\npreparations began at once, and were only stopped by the necessity of\nsetting off when the day arrived. How we emptied all our drawers and\ncupboards, and disarranged both our bookshelves; and, in making ready\nfor the life of order and tidiness we were to live abroad, passed that\nweek at home with our room in such chaos as it had never been before.\nHow we prepared against an amount of spare time, that experience\neventually teaches one is not to be found out visiting; and, with this\nobject, took more sewing than we should have performed in a month at\nhome; books, that we had not touched for years; drawings, that were\nfated to be once touched, and no more.\n\n\"I will not describe the big box, which my father lent to us, nor the\njoys of packing it. How Fatima's workbox dove-tailed with my desk. How\nthe books (not having been chosen with reference to this great event)\nwere of awkward sizes, and did not make comfortable paving for the\nbottom of the trunk; whilst folded stockings may be called the\npacker's delight, from their usefulness to fill up corners. How,\nhaving packed the whole week long, we were barely ready, and a good\ndeal flurried at the last moment; and how we took all our available\nproperty with us, and left the key of the trunk behind. Fancy for\nyourself, how the green coach picked us up at the toll-bar, and how,\nas it jingled on, we felt the first qualm of home-sickness, and,\nstretching our heads and hands out of the window, waved adieux and\nkisses innumerable to Home, regardless of our fellow-traveller in the\ncorner, an old gentleman, with a yellow silk handkerchief on his head,\nwho proved in the end a very pleasant companion. I remember that we\ntold him our family history, with minutest particulars, and conjugated\nfour regular Latin verbs by his orders; and that he rewarded our\nconfidences and learning with the most clear, the most sweet, the most\namber-coloured sticks of barley-sugar I have ever had the good fortune\nto meet with. I remember also how, in the warmth of our new\nfriendship, Fatima unveiled to him the future, which, through some\njoke of my father's, we had laid out for ourselves.\n\n\"I am to marry a Sultan, for I am moon-faced; but Mary is to be a\nlinguist, for she has large eyes.'\n\n\"'Then Miss Mary is not to marry?' said the old gentleman, with a grim\nsmile.\n\n\"I shook my head in sage disdain. 'When I am sixteen, I shall be an\nAmazon.'\n\n\"Precisely what I meant by this I don't think I knew myself, but my\ndreams were an odd compound of heroic and fairy lore, with a love and\nambition for learning that were simply an inheritance. Many a night\ndid I fancy myself master of all the languages of the world, hunting\nup and down the windy hills in a dress of Lincoln green. I had a\nmighty contempt for men, and a high respect for myself, that was the\ngreatest of my many follies.\n\n\"After these interesting revelations we had barley-sugar all round,\nand the coach rattled into Durnford.\n\n\"Shall I tell you how we were met at the Elephant and Castle by a\nfootman of most gentlemanlike appearance (his livery excepted), who,\nwith a sagacity which somewhat puzzled us, discovered that we were\n'the young ladies that were expected,' and led us to the carriage,\nfirmly opposing my efforts to fulfil the last home orders I had\nreceived, to 'look after the box?' How in the carriage we found a lady\nhandsomely dressed in black, who came out to meet us, and seemed so\nanxious for our comfort, and so much interested in our arrival, that\nwe naturally supposed her to be the lady who had invited us, till we\ndiscovered that she was a lady's maid; and on arriving found our\nhostess quite another sort of person, with no appearance at all of\nbeing particularly interested in our arrival, which I have since found\nto be the case with the heads of some other country houses.\n\n\"It was a large house, reminding me of the Manor within, but prettier\noutside; old and irregularly built, with mullioned windows, and odd\nwings and corners. A glowing, well-kept garden contrasted prettily\nwith the grey stone, and the grounds seemed magnificent to our eyes.\n\n\"We were shown into the drawing-room, where the real lady of the house\nsat at a dainty writing-table, scratching away at a letter that was no\ndoubt as affectionate as the one which my mother had received. She was\nshortsighted, which seemed to be the case also with most of the other\nladies in the room; this, perhaps, was why they stared so hard at us,\nand then went on with the elaborate pieces of needlework on which all\nof them were engaged. It seemed to take our hostess a second or two to\nsee us, and another second or two to recall who we were; then she came\nforward very kindly, showed us where to sit, and asked after my\nmother. Whilst I was replying, she crossed to the fire-place, and rang\nthe bell; and I felt slightly surprised by her seeming to wish for no\nfurther news of her old friend. She asked if we had had a pleasant\njourney, and Fatima had hardly pronounced a modest yes, before she\nbegged we would allow her to finish her letter, and went back to the\nspindle-legged table. Whilst she scratched we looked around us. Three\nor four ladies were in the room, more or less young, more or less\npretty, more or less elegantly dressed, and all with more or less\nelaborate pieces of needlework. There was one gentleman, young and\ndark, with large brown eyes, who seemed to be employed in making paper\npellets of an old letter, chatting the while in a low voice to a young\nlady with a good deal of red hair. We afterwards found out that he was\nan Irishman, familiarly called 'Pat' by some of the young ladies, who\nseemed to be related to him. We had seen all this when the man-servant\nappeared at the door.\n\n\"'Where is Miss Lucy, Thompson?' our hostess asked, sharply.\n\n\"'I will inquire, ma'am,' Thompson replied, with the utmost softness,\nand vanished.\n\n\"The scratching began again, the Irishman went on gently chatting, and\nit all felt very like a horrid dream. Then Thompson reappeared.\n\n\"'Miss Lucy is out, ma'am.'\n\n\"'Did she know what time these young ladies were to arrive?'\n\n\"'Miss Lucy knew that the carriage had gone to meet them, ma'am.'\n\n\"'Very thoughtless! Very thoughtless indeed!' said the lady. Thompson\npaused respectfully, as if to receive the full weight of the remark,\nand then vanished noiselessly as before.\n\n\"There was an awkward pause. Our hostess left off scratching, and\nlooked very cross; the Irishman fired one of his pellets across the\nroom, and left off chatting, and the red-haired young lady got up, and\nrustled across to us. I remember her so well, Ida, for we fell deeply\nin love with her and her kindness. I remember her green and white\ndress. She had a fair round face, more pleasant than really pretty, a\nwhite starlike forehead, almost too firm a mouth, but a very gentle\nvoice, at least, so we thought, when she said:\n\n\"'As Lucy is out, may I take these young ladies to their room?'\n\n\"Our hostess hesitated, and murmured something about Bedford, who was\nthe lady's maid. The starlike forehead contracted, and the red-haired\nyoung lady said, rather emphatically:\n\n\"'As Lucy is not in to receive her friends, I thought I might perhaps\nsupply her place.'\n\n\"'Well, my dear Kate, if you will be so kind,' said our hostess, 'I\nmust finish these letters.'\n\n\"'The yellow room?' said the young lady, abruptly, and swept us off\nwithout further parley. The Irish gentleman opened the door for us,\nstaring with a half-puzzled, half-amused look at the lofty air with\nwhich the young lady passed out. He followed us into the hall, where\nwe left him discharging his remaining pellets at the furniture, and\nwhistling 'Kathleen Mavourneen,' as clearly as a bird.\n\n\"The yellow room was a large airy one, with white painted wainscoting,\na huge four-post bed with yellow curtains, and a pretty view from the\nwindows. In the middle of the floor we saw our box standing in all its\ndignity, uncorded, and ready. Then it was the terrible fact broke upon\nour minds that the key was left behind. My sufferings during the few\nseconds before I found courage to confide this misfortune to our new\nfriend were considerable. When I did tell her, the calmness and good\nnature with which she received the confession were both surprising and\ndelightful.\n\n\"'The lock doesn't look a very uncommon one, she said, as she opened\nthe door. 'I dare say I may find a key to fit it.'\n\n\"'What's the matter?' said a voice outside. It was the Irish\ngentleman. She explained.\n\n\"'Keys?' said the Irish gentleman; 'got lots in my pocket, besides\ntheir being totally unnecessary, as I'm a capital hand at\nlock-picking. Let me see.'\n\n\"With which he slipped in, seeming quite as much at his ease as in the\ndrawing-room, and in another second had squatted upon the floor before\nour box, where he seemed to be quite as comfortable as in the\narm-chair he had left. Here he poked, and fitted, and whistled, and\nchatted without a pause.\n\n\"'I've locks and keys to everything I possess' he cheerfully remarked;\n'and as I never lock up anything, there's no damage done if the keys\nare left behind, which is a good thing, you see, as I always leave\neverything everywhere.'\n\n\"'Do you make a principle of it?' asked the young lady, coldly.\n\n\"'I'm afraid I make a practice of it.' He had opened the box, and was\nleaning against the bed-post, with a roguish twinkle in his brown\neyes, which faded, however, under the silent severity of the\nred-haired young lady, and gave place to a look of melancholy that\nmight have melted granite, as he added:\n\n\"'I'm all alone, you see, that's what does it. I believe I'm the\nneatest creature breathing, if I'd only somebody to keep me up to it.'\n\n\"Neither his hardened untidiness nor his lonely lot seemed, however,\nto weigh heavily on his mind; for he withdrew whistling, and his notes\nwere heard about the passages for some little time. When they had died\naway in a distant part of the house, the red-haired young lady left us\nalso.\n\n\"I shall not give you a lengthened account of our unpacking, dear Ida;\nthough it was as enjoyable, but less protracted than the packing-up\nhad been. How we revelled in the spacious drawers and cupboards, over\nwhich we were queens, and how strictly we followed one of our mother's\nwise counsels--'unpack to the bottom of your box at once, however\nshort your visit may be; it saves time in the end.' We did unpack to\nthe lowest book (an artificial system of memory, which I had long been\npurposing to study, which I thought to find spare moments to get up\nhere, and which, I may as well confess, I did not look at during the\nvisit, and have not learnt to this day). We divided shelves and pegs\nwith all fairness, and as a final triumph found a use for the\nelaborate watch-pockets that hung above our pillows. They were rich\nwith an unlimited expenditure of quilled ribbon, and must have given a\ngreat deal of trouble to someone who had not very many serious\noccupations in this life. Fatima and I wished that we had watches to\nput in them, till the happy thought suddenly struck one of us, that we\ncould keep in them our respective papers of good habits.\n\n\"Bedford came in whilst we were in the midst of our labours, and\nwarmly begged us to leave everything to her, as she would put our\nthings away for us. The red-haired young lady had sent her, and she\nbecame a mainstay of practical comfort to us during our visit. She\nseemed a haven of humanity after the conventions of the drawing-room.\nFrom her we got incidental meals when we were hungry, spirits of wine\nwhen Fatima's tooth ached, warnings when we were near to being late\nfor breakfast, little modern and fashionable turns to our hair and\nclothes, and familiar anecdotes of this household and of others in\nwhich she had lived. I remember her with gratitude.\n\n\"Miss Lucy came home before our putting away was fairly finished, and\nwe had tea with her in the schoolroom. She was a slight, sharp, lively\nyoung lady, looking older than fifteen to us, rather pretty, and very\nself-possessed. She scanned us from head to foot when we first met,\nand I felt as if her eyes had found defects innumerable, which seemed\nthe less likely, as she also was shortsighted. As her governess was\naway visiting a sick relative, Miss Lucy did the honours of the\nschoolroom. She was cold and inattentive at first, became patronizing\nat tea, and ended by being gracious. In her gracious mood she was both\naffectionate and confidential. She called us 'my dear girls,' put her\narms round us as we sat in the dark, and chattered without a pause\nabout herself, her governesses, her sister, and her sister's husband.\n\n\"'A wedding in the house,' she observed, 'is very good fun,\nparticularly if you take a principal part in it. I was chief\nbride's-maid, you know, my dear girls. But I'll tell you the whole\naffair from the first. You know I had never been bride's-maid before,\nand I couldn't make up my mind about how I should like the dresses,'\netc., etc. And we had got no further in the story than Miss Lucy's own\ncostume, when we were called to dress and go downstairs.\n\n\"'What are you going to put on?' she asked, balancing herself at our\ndoor and peering in.\n\n\"'White muslin!' we said with some pride, for they were new frocks,\nand splendid in our eyes.\n\n\"'I have had so many muslins, I am tired of them,' she said; 'I shall\nwear a pink silk to-night. The trimming came from London. Perhaps I\nmay wear a muslin to-morrow; I have an Indian one. But you shall see\nmy dresses to-morrow, my dear girls.'\n\n\"With which she left us, and we put on our new frocks (which were to\nbe _the_ evening dresses of our visit) in depressed spirits. This was\nowing to the thought of the pink silk, and of the possibility of a\nsurfeit of white muslin.\n\n\"During the evening we learnt another of Miss Lucy's peculiarities.\nAffectionate as she had been when we were alone together, she was no\nsooner among the grown-up young ladies downstairs than she kept with\nthem as much as she was permitted, and seemed to forget us altogether.\nPerhaps a fit of particularly short sight attacked her; for she seemed\nto look over us, away from us, on each side of us, anywhere but at us,\nand to be quite unconscious of our existence. The red-haired young\nlady had made her fetch us a large scrap-book, and we sat with this\nbefore our eyes, and the soft monotonous chit-chat of our hostess in\nour ears, as she talked and worked with some elder ladies on the sofa.\nIt seemed a long gossip, with no particular end or beginning, in which\ntatting, trimmings, military distinction, linens, servants, honourable\nconduct, sentiment, settlements, expectations, and Bath waters, were\nfinely blended. From the constant mention of Cecilia and the dear\nmajor, it was evident that the late wedding was the subject of\ndiscourse; indeed, for that matter, it remained the prime topic of\nconversation during our stay.\n\n\"Cecilia and the dear major were at Bath, and their letters were read\naloud at the breakfast-table. I remember wondering at the deep\ninterest that all the ladies seemed to take in the bride's pretty flow\nof words about the fashions, the drives, and the pump-room, and the\nlong lists of visitors' names; this, too, without any connection\nbetween the hearers and the people and places mentioned. When anybody\ndid recognize a name, however, about which she knew anything, it\nseemed like the finding of a treasure. All the ladies bore down upon\nit at once, dug up the family history to its farthest known point, and\ndivided the subject among them. Miss Lucy followed these letters\nclosely, and remembered them wonderfully, though (as I afterwards\nfound) she had never seen Bath, and knew no more of the people\nmentioned than the little hearsay facts she had gathered from former\nletters.\n\n\"It is a very useful art, my dear Ida, and one in which I have sadly\nfailed all my life, to be able to remember who is related to whom,\nwhat watering-place such a family went to the summer before last, and\nwhich common friends they met there, etc. But, like other arts, it\ndemands close attention, forbids day-dreaming, and takes up a good\ndeal of time.\n\n\"'_Wasn't_ it odd,' said Miss Lucy, one morning after breakfast, 'that\nCecilia and the major should meet those Hicksons!'\n\n\"'Who are the Hicksons?' I asked.\n\n\"'Oh! my dear girl, don't you remember, in Cecilia's last letter, her\ntelling us about the lady she met in that shop when they were in town,\nbuying a shawl the counterpart of her own? and it seems so odd they\nshould turn up in Bath, and be such nice people! Don't you remember\nmamma said it must be the same family as that Colonel Hickson who was\nengaged to a girl with one eye, and she caught the small-pox and got\nso much marked, and he broke it off?'\n\n\"'Small-pox and one eye would look very ugly,' Fatima languidly\nobserved; and this subject drifted after the rest.\n\n\"One afternoon, I remember, it chanced that we were left alone with\nour hostess in the drawing-room. No one else happened to be in the way\nto talk to, and the good lady talked to us. We were clever girls for\nour age, I fancy, and we had been used to talk a good deal with our\nmother; at any rate we were attentive listeners, and I do not think\nour hostess required much more of us. I think she was glad of anybody\nwho had not heard the whole affair from beginning to end, and so she\nput up her feet on the sofa, and started afresh with the complete\nhistory of her dear Cecilia from the cradle; and had gone on to the\nmajor, his military exploits abroad, his genteel connections at home,\nand the tendency to gout in the family which troubled him at times,\nand was a sad anxiety to her dear child, when visitors were announced.\n\n\"Our intelligent attention had gained favour for us; and we were\nintroduced to these ladies as 'daughters of a very dear friend of\nmine, whom I have not seen for years,' on which one lady gave a sweet\nglance and a tight smile and murmured:\n\n\"'So pleasant to renew acquaintance in the children;' and the other\nladies gave sweet glances, and tight smiles also, and echoed:\n\n\"'So pleasant!'\n\n\"'Such sensible girls!' said our hostess, as if we were not there;\n'like women of fifty. So like their dear mother! Such treasures to my\nlittle Lucy! You know she has lost her dear sister,' etc., etc.\n\n\"For then the ladies drew together, and our hostess having got a fresh\naudience, we retired to distant arm-chairs, a good deal bewildered.\n\n\"But to return to our first evening.\n\n\"Miss Lucy and we retired together, and no sooner had the drawing-room\ndoor closed behind us, than she wound her arms round our waists, and\nbecame as devoted as if we had been side by side the whole evening.\n\n\"'I'll tell you what I'll do, my dear girls,' she said when we\nreached our room; 'I'll come and sleep with you (there's lots of room\nfor three), and then I can go on about Cecilia's affair, and if we\ndon't finish to-night we can go on to-morrow morning before we get up.\nI always wake early, so I can call you. I'll come back when I'm ready\nfor bed.'\n\n\"And she vanished.\n\n\"We were in bed when she returned. Her hair had been undergoing some\nwonderful process, and was now stowed away under a large and elaborate\nnight-cap.\n\n\"'Bedford was so slow,' said she; 'and then, you know, I got into bed,\nand let her tidy the room, and then when she was fairly gone, out I\ngot, and here I am. We shall be as comfortable as possible; I'll be in\nthe middle, and then I can have you on each side of me, my dear\ngirls;' and in she sprang.\n\n\"'Did you notice this?' she asked, holding up her hand, and pointing\nout the edging on the sleeve of her night-dress; 'it's a new pattern;\ndo you know it? Oh! my dears, the yards and yards of tatting that\nCecilia had for her trousseau!'\n\n\"Fatima and I were not rich in tatting edges, and rejoiced when the\nconversation took another turn.\n\n\"'About the proposal,' she rambled on; 'do you know I don't really\nknow whereabouts Henry (that is the major, my brother-in-law,' she\nadded, with one of the little attacks of dignity to which she was\nsubject) 'proposed or what he said. I asked Cecy, but she wouldn't\ntell me. She was very cross, often; I'm very glad she's married. I\nthink sisters ought to marry off as fast as they can; they never get\non well in a house together, you know.'\n\n\"I fairly gasped at this idea, and Fatima said bluntly:\n\n\"'There are lots of us, and we get on.\n\n\"'Ah!' said Miss Lucy, in tones of wisdom; 'wait till you're a little\nolder, and you'll see. Cecy was at school with two sisters who hated\neach other like poison, and they were obliged to dress alike, and the\nyounger wore out her things much faster than the other one, but she\nwas obliged to wear them till her sister's were done. She used to wish\nso her sister would marry, Cecy said, and the best fun is, now they're\nboth in love with the same man. He's the curate of the church they go\nto.'\n\n\"'Which of them is he in love with?' I asked.\n\n\"'Oh, neither that I know of,' said Miss Lucy, composedly. 'They don't\nknow him, you know; but they sit close under the pulpit, and they have\nsuch struggles about which shall get into the corner of the pew that's\nnearest. Cecy and I weren't like that; but still I'm very glad she's\nmarried. Now wasn't it stupid of her not to tell me? I should never\nhave told anybody, you know. And don't you wonder what gentlemen do\nsay, and how they say it? He couldn't propose sitting, and I think\nstanding would be very awkward. I suppose he knelt. Aunt Maria doesn't\napprove of gentlemen kneeling; she says it's idolatry. I think they\nmust look very silly. Cecy wouldn't even tell me what he said. She\nsaid he spoke to mamma, and mamma said his conduct was highly\nhonourable; but I think it was very stupid. Do you know, my dears, I\nhave a cousin who was really married at Gretna Green? She married an\nofficer. He was splendidly handsome; but people said things against\nhim, and her parents objected. So they eloped, and then went to Wales,\nto such a lovely place! Wasn't it romantic? They quarrelled afterwards\nthough; he lives abroad now. People ought to be careful. I shall be\nvery careful myself; I mean to refuse the first few offers I get.'\n\n\"And so Miss Lucy rambled on, perfectly unconscious of the melancholy\nand yet ludicrous way in which she degraded serious subjects, which\nshe was not old enough to understand, or wise enough to reverence. We\nwere too young then to see it fully, but her frivolity jarred upon us,\nthough she amused us, and excited our curiosity. She was not worse\nthan many other girls, with plenty of inquisitiveness and sharp sense,\nand not too much refinement and feeling; whose accomplishments are\nlearnt from the 'first masters,' and whose principles are left to be\npicked up from gossip, servants, and second-rate books; digested by\nignorant, inquisitive, and undisciplined minds.\n\n\"I won't try to recall any more of it, dear Ida. I remember it was a\ncontinuous stream of unedifying gossip, varied by small boastings\nabout her own family. We've so many connections, was a favourite\nphrase of Miss Lucy's, and it seemed to mean a great deal. 'Do you\nlike making trees?' she asked. I was getting sleepy, and without much\nthought replied, 'I love trees beyond anything, and I like growing oak\ntrees in bottles.' Miss Lucy's, 'My dear girl, I mean family trees,\ngenealogical trees,' was patronizing to scorn. 'Ours is in the spring\ndrawer of the big oak cabinet in the drawing-room,' she added. 'We are\ndescended from King Stephen.'\n\n\"I believe I was the first to fall asleep that night. The last words I\nremember hearing were: 'We've so many connections.'\n\n\"The next day's post brought news from Bath of more general interest\nto the household. The plans of Cecilia and the major were changed;\nthey were coming to her mother's on the following Monday.\n\n\"'My dear girls, I _am_ so glad!' said Miss Lucy; 'you'll see them.\nBut you will have to move out of your room, I'm sorry to say.'\n\n\"And for the next twelve hours Miss Lucy was more descriptive of her\nfamily glories in general, and of the glories of her sister and\nbrother-in-law in particular, than ever.\n\n\"Sunday was a day of mixed experiences to us; some pleasant and some\nthe reverse. Miss Lucy in her best clothes was almost intolerably\npatronizing, and a general stiffness seemed to pervade everything, the\nladies' silk dresses included. After breakfast we dawdled about till\nit was time to dress for church, and as most of the ladies took about\nfive minutes more than they had allowed for, it seemed likely that we\nshould be late. At the last moment, Miss Lucy lost her Prayer Book,\nand it was not till another five minutes had gone in the search that\nshe remembered having left it in church the Sunday before. This being\nsettled we all stowed away in the carriages and drove off. It was only\na short drive; but when we came in sight of the quaint little church\nthere was no sound of bells, and it became evident that we were late.\nIn the porch we shook out our dresses, the Irishman divided the burden\nof Prayer Books he had been gallantly bearing, our hostess turned back\nfrom the half-open door to say in a loud and encouraging whisper,\n'It's only the Confession;' and we swept up the little church into a\nhuge square pew.\n\n\"My dear Ida, I must tell you that we had been brought up to have a\njust horror of being late for service, this being a point on which my\nfather was what is called 'very particular.' Fatima and I therefore\nfelt greatly discomposed by our late and disturbing entrance, though\nwe were in no way to blame. We had also been taught to kneel during\nthe prayers, and it was with a most uncomfortable sensation of doubt\nand shame-facedness that we saw one lady after another sit down and\nbend her bonnet over her lap, and hesitated ourselves to follow our\nown customs in the face of such a majority. But the red-haired young\nlady seemed fated to help us out of our difficulties. She sank at once\non her knees in a corner of the pew, her green silk falling round her;\nwe knelt by her side, and the question was settled. The little\nIrishman cast a doubtful glance at her for a moment, and then sat\ndown, bending his head deeply into his hat. We went through a similar\nprocess about responding, which did not seem to be the fashion with\nour hostess and her friends. The red-haired young lady held to her own\ncustoms, however, and we held with her. Our responses were the less\nconspicuous, as they were a good deal drowned by the voice of an old\ngentleman in the next pew. Diversity seemed to prevail in the manners\nof the congregation. This gentleman stood during prayers, balancing a\nhuge Prayer Book on the corner of the pew, and responding in a loud\nvoice, more devout than tuneful, keeping exact time with the parson\nalso, as if he had a grudge against the clerk and felt it due to\nhimself to keep in advance of him. I remember, Ida, that as we came\nin, he was just saying, 'those things which we ought _not_ to have\ndone,' and he said it in so terrible a voice, and took such a glance\nat us over his gold-rimmed spectacles, that I wished the massive\npulpit-hangings would fall and bury my confusion. When the text of\nthe sermon had been given out, our hostess rustled up, and drew the\ncurtains well round our pew. Opposite to me, however, there was a gap\nthrough which I could see the old gentleman. He had settled himself\nfacing the pulpit, and sat there gazing at the preacher with a rigid\nattention which seemed to say--'Sound doctrine, if you please; I have\nmy eye on you.'\n\n\"We returned as we came.\n\n\"'Is there afternoon service?' I asked Miss Lucy.\n\n\"'Oh, yes!' was the reply, 'the servants go in the afternoon.'\n\n\"'Don't you?' I asked.\n\n\"'Oh, no!' said Miss Lucy, 'once is enough. You can go with the maids,\nif you want to, my dears,' she added, with one of the occasional\ntouches of insolence in which she indulged.\n\n\"Afternoon arrived, and I held consultation with Fatima as to what we\nwere to do.\n\n\"When once roused, Fatima was more resolute than I.\n\n\"'Of course we'll go,' said she; 'what's the use of having written out\nall our good rules and sticking at this? We always go twice at home.\nLet's look for Bedford.'\n\n\"On which mission I set forth, but when I reached the top of the\nstairs I caught sight of the red-haired young lady, in her bonnet and\nshawl, standing at the open door, a Prayer Book in her hand. I dashed\ndownstairs, and entered the hall just as the Irishman came into it by\nanother door. In his hand was a Prayer Book also, and he picked up his\nhat, and went smiling towards her. But as he approached the young\nlady, she looked so much annoyed--not to say cross--that I hesitated\nto go forwards.\n\n\"'Are you going to church?' said the little Irishman, with a pleased\nlook.\n\n\"'I don't know,' said the young lady, briefly, 'are you?'\n\n\"'I was--' he began, and stopped short, looking puzzled and vexed.\n\n\"'Is no else going?' he asked, after a moment's pause.\n\n\"'No one else ever does go,' she said, impatiently, and moved into the\nhall.\n\n\"The Irishman coloured.\n\n\"'I am in the habit of going twice myself, though you may not think\nit,' he said, quietly; 'my poor mother always did. But I do not\npretend to go to such good purpose as she did, or as you would, so if\nit is to lie between us--'and, without finishing his sentence, he\nthrew his book (not too gently) on to the table, and, just lifting his\nhat as he passed her, dashed out into the garden.\n\n\"I did not at all understand this little scene, but, as soon as he was\ngone, I ran up to ask our friend if she were going to church, and\nwould take us. She consented, and I went back in triumph to Fatima. As\nthere was no time to lose, we dressed quickly enough; so that I was\nrather surprised, when we went down, to find the Irish gentleman, with\nhis face restored to its usual good humour, standing by our friend,\nand holding her Prayer Book as well as his own. The young lady did not\nspeak, but, cheerfully remarking that we had plenty of time before us,\nhe took our books also, and we all set forth.\n\n\"I remember that walk so well, Ida! The hot, sweet summer\nafternoon--the dusty plants by the pathway--the clematis in the hedges\n(I put a bit into my Prayer Book, which was there for years)--the\ngrasshoppers and flies that our dresses caught up from the long grass,\nand which reappeared as we sat during the sermon.\n\n\"The old gentleman was in his pew, but his glance was almost\nbenevolent, as, in good time, we took our places. We (literally)\n_followed_ his example with much heartiness in the responses; and, if\nhe looked over into our pew during prayers (and from his position he\ncould hardly avoid it), he must have seen that even the Irishman had\nrejected compromises, and that we all knelt together.\n\n\"There was one other feature of that service not to be forgotten. When\nthe sermon was ended, and I had lost sight of the last grasshopper in\nmy hasty rising, we found that there was to be a hymn. It was the old\ncustom of this church so to conclude Evening Prayer. No one seemed to\nuse a book--it was Bishop Ken's evening hymn, which everyone knew,\nand, I think, everyone sang. But the feature of it to us was when the\nIrishman began to sing. From her startled glance, I think not even the\nred-haired young lady had known that he possessed so beautiful a\nvoice. It had a clearness without effort, a tone, a truth, a pathos,\nsuch as I have not often heard. It sounded strangely above the nasal\ntones of the school-children, and the scraping of a solitary fiddle.\nEven our neighbour, who had lustily followed the rhythm of the tune,\nthough without much varying from the note on which he responded,\nsoftened his own sounds and turned to look at the Irishman, who sang\non without noticing it, till, in the last verse, he seemed disturbed\nto discover how many eyes were on him. Happily, self-consciousness had\ncome too late. The hymn was ended.\n\n\"We knelt again for the Benediction, and then went back through the\nsummer fields.\n\n\"The red-haired young lady talked very little. Once she said:\n\n\"'How is it we have never heard you sing?'\n\n\"To which the Irishman replied:\n\n\"'I don't understand music, I sing by ear; and I hate 'company'\nperformances. I will sing to you whenever you like.'\n\n\"'Mary,' said Fatima, when we were in our room again, 'I believe those\ntwo will marry each other some day.'\n\n\"'So do I,' I answered; 'but don't say anything about it to Lucy.'\n\n\"'No, indeed!' said Fatima, warmly. So we kept this idea sacred from\nMiss Lucy's comments--why, I do not think either of us could have told\nin words.\n\n'Pity, that pleasant impressions--pity, that most impressions--pass\naway so soon!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The evening was not altogether so satisfactory as the afternoon had\nbeen. First, Miss Lucy took us to see her sister's wedding-presents,\nmost of which were still here in her mother's keeping. They were\nsplendid, and Miss Lucy was eloquent. From them we dawdled on into her\nroom, where she displayed her own treasures, with a running commentary\non matters of taste and fashion, which lasted till it was time to\ndress for the evening, when she made the usual inquiry, 'What shall\nyou put on to-night, my dear girls?' and we blushed to own that there\nwas nothing further of our limited toilettes to reveal.\n\n\"In the drawing-room, similar subjects of conversation awaited us. Our\nhostess and her friends did not seem to care much for reading, and, as\nthey did not work on Sunday evening, they talked the more. The chatter\nran chiefly upon the Bath fashions, and upon some ball which had been\nheld somewhere, where somebody had been dressed after a manner that it\nappeared needful to protest against; whilst somebody else (a cousin of\nour hostess) was at all points so perfectly attired, that it seemed as\nif she should have afforded ample consolation for the other lady's\ndefects.\n\n\"Upon the beauty of this cousin, her father's wealth, and her\nsuperabundant opportunities of matrimony, Miss Lucy enlarged to us, as\nwe sat in a corner. Another of her peculiarities, by-the-by, was this.\nBy her own account, all her relatives and friends were in some sense\nbeautiful. The men were generally 'splendidly handsome;' the ladies,\n'the loveliest creatures.' If not 'lovely,' they were 'stylish;' if\nnothing else, they were 'charming.' For those who were beyond the\nmagic circle, this process was reversed. If pretty, they 'wanted\nstyle.' If the dress was beyond criticism, the nose, the complexion,\nthe hand was at fault. I have met with this _trait_ in other cliques,\nsince then.\n\n\"My dear Ida, I wish to encourage no young lady of the hoydenish age\nof thirteen, in despising nice dressing and pretty looks and manners;\nor in neglecting to pick up any little hints which she may glean in\nsuch things from older friends. But there are people to whom these\nquestions seem of such first importance, that to be with them when you\nare young and impressionable, is to feel every defect in your own\npersonal appearance to be a crime, and to believe that there is\nneither worth, nor love, nor happiness (no life, in fact, worth living\nfor) connected with much less than ten thousand a year, and\n'connections.' Through some such ordeal we passed that evening, in\nseeing and hearing of all the expensive luxuries without which it\nseemed impossible to feed, dress, sleep, go out--in fact, exist; and\nall the equally expensive items of adornment, without which it\nappeared to be impossible to have (or at any rate retain) the respect\nand affection of your friends.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the evening slipped by, and our Sunday reading had not\nbeen accomplished. We had found little good habits less easy to\nmaintain in a strange household than we had thought, and this one\nseemed likely to follow some others that had been allowed to slip.\nThe red-haired young lady had been absent for about half an hour, and\nthe Irishman had been prowling restlessly round the room, performing\nmurderous-looking fidgets with the paper-knives, when she returned\nwith a book in her hand, which she settled herself resolutely to read.\nThe Irishman gave a comical glance at the serious-looking volume, and\nthen, seating himself on a chair just behind her, found apparent peace\nin the effort to sharpen a flat ruler on his knees. The young lady\nread on. It was evident that her Sunday customs were not apt to be\ndisturbed by circumstances.\n\n\"I began to feel uncomfortable. Fatima was crouched down near Lucy,\nlistening to the history of a piece of lace. I waited some little time\nto catch her eye, and then beckoned her to me.\n\n\"'We haven't read,' I whispered.\n\n\"'Dare you go?' asked Fatima.\n\n\"'We ought,' I said.\n\n\"It required more daring than may appear. To such little people as\nourselves it _was_ rather an undertaking to cross the big\ndrawing-room, stealing together over the soft carpet; to attack the\nlarge, smooth handle, open the heavy door, and leave the room in the\nface of the company. We did it, however, our confusion being much\nincreased by the Irish gentleman, who jumped up to open the door for\nus. We were utterly unable to thank him, and, stumbling over each\nother in the passage, flew up to our own room like caged birds set\nfree.\n\n\"Fatima drew out the pillows from the bed, and made herself easy on\nthe floor. I found the book, and climbed into the window-seat. The sun\nwas setting, the light would not last much longer; yet I turned over\nthe pages slowly, to find the place, which was in the second part,\nthinking of the conversation downstairs. Fatima heaved a deep sigh\namong her cushions, and said: 'I wish we were rich.'\n\n\"'I wish we were at home,' I answered.\n\n\"'When one's at home,' Fatima continued, in doleful tones, 'one\ndoesn't feel it, because one sees nobody; but when one goes among\nother people, it _is_ wretched not to have plenty of money and things.\nAnd it's no good saying it isn't,' she added, hurriedly, as if to\nclose the subject.\n\n\"'It's getting dark,' I said.\n\n\"'I beg your pardon: go on,' sighed Fatima.\n\n\"I lifted up my voice, and read till I could see no longer. It was\nabout the Valley of Humiliation through which Mr. Greatheart led\nChristiana and her children. The 'green valley, beautified with\nlilies,' in whose meadows the air was pleasant; where 'a man shall be\nfree from the noise and from the hurryings of this life;' and where\n'in former times men have met with angels.'\n\n\"The last streaks of crimson were fading in the sky when I read the\nconcluding lines of the shepherd-boy's song--\n\n    'Fulness to such a burden is,\n    That go on pilgrimage,\n    Here little, and hereafter bliss,\n    Is best from age to age.'\n\n\"'Here little, and hereafter bliss!'\n\n\"It is not always easy to realize what one believes. One needs\nsometimes to get away from the world around, 'from the noise and from\nthe hurryings of this life,' and to hear, read, see, or do something\nto remind one that there is a standard which is not of drawing-rooms;\nthat petty troubles are the pilgrimage of the soul; that great and\nhappy lives have been lived here by those who have had but little; and\nthat satisfying bliss is not here, but hereafter.\n\n\"We went downstairs slowly, hand in hand.\n\n\"'I wonder what mother is doing?' said Fatima.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The next day Miss Lucy very good-naturedly helped us to move our\nbelongings into the smaller room we were now to occupy. It was in\nanother part of the house, and we rather enjoyed the running to and\nfro, especially as Miss Lucy was gracious and communicative in the\nextreme.\n\n\"'This is the oldest part of the house,' she said, as we sat on the\nbed resting from our labours, for the day was sultry; 'and it breaks\noff here in an odd way. There are no rooms beyond this. There were\nsome that matched the other side of the house, but they were pulled\ndown.'\n\n\"'Why?' we asked.\n\n\"'Well, there's a story about it, in the family,' said Miss Lucy,\nmysteriously. 'But it's a ghost story. I'll tell you, if you like. But\nsome people are afraid of ghost stories. I'm not; but if you are, I\nwon't tell it.'\n\n\"Of course we declared we were not afraid. Sitting there together, on\na sunny summer's afternoon, perhaps we were not.\n\n\"'It's years and years ago,' began Miss Lucy; 'you know the place has\nbelonged to another branch of our family for generations. Well, at\nlast it came down to an old Mr. Bartlett, who had one daughter, who,\nof course, was to be the heiress. Well, she fell in love with a man\nwhose name I forget, but he was of inferior family, and very queer\ncharacter; and her father would not hear of it, and swore that if she\nmarried him he would disinherit her. She would have married the man in\nspite of this, though; but what he wanted was her money; so, when he\nfound that the old man was quite resolute, and that there was no\nchance of his dying soon, he murdered him.'\n\n\"We both exclaimed; for this sudden catastrophe fairly took away our\nbreath. Miss Lucy's nerves were not sensitive, however, and she\nrattled on.\n\n\"'He smothered him in bed, and, as he was a very old man, and might\neasily have died in the night some other way, and as nothing could be\nproved, he got off. Well, he married the daughter, and got the\nproperty; but the very first evening after he took possession, as he\nwas passing the door of the old man's room, he heard somebody\nbreathing heavily inside, and when he looked in, there was the old\nfather asleep in his bed.'\n\n\"'Not really?' we said.\n\n\"'Of course not really,' said Miss Lucy, 'but so it was said. That's\nthe ghost part of it. Well, do what he would, he never could get rid\nof the old man, who was always there asleep; so he pulled the rooms\ndown, and at last he went abroad, and there both he and his wife died,\nand the property went to a cousin, who took the name of Bartlett.'\n\n\"'How awful!' we murmured. But Miss Lucy laughed, and told us other\nfamily anecdotes, and the ghost story somewhat passed from our minds,\nespecially as a little later we heard wheels, and, peeping from the\nlanding window, beheld a post-chaise drive up.\n\n\"'It's Cecilia!' screamed Miss Lucy, and left us at once.\n\n\"I may as well say here, my dear Ida, that Cecilia and the major\nproved altogether different from our expectations. Cecilia, in\ntravelling gear, taking off an old bonnet, begging for a cup of tea,\nand complaining in soft accents that butter was a halfpenny a pound\ndearer in Bath than at home, seemed to have no connection with that\nCecilia into the trimmings of whose dresses bank-notes had recklessly\ndissolved. The major, an almost middle-aged man, of roughish exterior,\nin plain clothes, pulling his moustache over a letter that had arrived\nfor him, dispelled our visions of manly beauty and military pomp even\nmore effectually. Later on, we discovered that Cecilia was really\npretty, soft, and gentle, a good deal lectured by her mother, and\nherself more critical of Miss Lucy's dress and appearance than that\nyoung lady had been of ours. The major proved kind and sensible. He\nwas well-to-do and had 'expectations,' which facts shed round him a\nglory invisible to us. They seemed a happy couple; more like the rest\nof the world than we had been led to suppose.\n\n\"The new-comers completely absorbed our attention during the evening,\nand it was not till we were fairly entering the older part on the\nhouse on our way to bed, that the story of the old man's ghost\nrecurred to my mind. It was a relief to meet Bedford at this point, to\nhear her cheerful good-night, and to see her turn into a room only two\ndoors from ours. Once while we were undressing I said:\n\n\"'What a horrid story that was that Lucy told us.'\n\n\"To which sensible Fatima made answer: 'Don't talk about it.'\n\n\"We dismissed the subject by consent, got into bed, and I fell asleep.\nI do not quite know how far on it was into the night when I was roused\nby Fatima's voice repeating my name over and over again, in tones of\nsubdued terror. I know nothing more irritatingly alarming, when one is\nyoung and nervous, than to be roused thus by a voice in which the\nterror is evident and the cause unknown.\n\n\"'What's the matter?' I asked.\n\n\"'Don't you hear?' gasped Fatima, in a whisper.\n\n\"If she had said at once that there was a robber under the bed, a\nburglar at the window, or a ghost in the wardrobe, I should have\nprepared for the worst, and it would have been less alarming than this\nunknown evil.\n\n\"'I hear nothing,' I said, pettishly. 'I wish you'd go to sleep,\nFatima.'\n\n\"'There!--now!' said Fatima.\n\n\"I held my breath, and in the silence heard distinctly the sound of\nsome one snoring in an adjoining apartment.\n\n\"'It's only some one snoring,' I said.\n\n\"'Where?' asked Fatima, with all the tragedy in her voice unabated.\n\n\"'In the room behind us, of course,' I said, impatiently. 'Can't you\nhear?'\n\n\"Fatima's voice might have been the voice of a shadow as she answered:\n'_There is no room there._'\n\n\"And then a cold chill crept over me also; for I remembered that the\nwall from behind which the snoring unmistakably proceeded was an outer\nwall. There had been the room of old Mr. Bartlett, which his\nson-in-law and murderer had pulled down. There he had been heard\n'breathing heavily,' and had been seen asleep upon his bed, long after\nhe was smothered in his own pillows, and his body shut up in the\nfamily vault. At least, so it was said, and at that particular moment\nwe felt no comfort from the fact that Miss Lucy had said that 'of\ncourse it wasn't true.' I said something, to which Fatima made no\nreply, and I could feel her trembling, and hear a half-choked sob. I\nthink fear for her overpowered my other alarm, and gave me a sort of\nstrength.\n\n\"'Don't, dear,' I begged. 'Let's be brave. It must be something else.\nAnd there's nothing in the room. Let's go to Bedford. She's next door\nbut one.'\n\n\"Fatima could speak no more. By the moonlight through the blind, I\njumped up, and half dragged, half helped her out of bed and across the\nroom. Opening the door was the worst. To touch anything at such a\nmoment is a trial. We groped down the passage; I felt the handle of\nthe first door, and turned that of the second, and in we went. The\nwindow-blind of this room was drawn up, and the moonlight streamed\nover everything. A nest of white drapery covered one chair, a muslin\ndress lay like a sick ghost over a second, some little black satin\nshoes and web-like stockings were on the floor, a gold watch and one\nor two feminine ornaments lay on the table; and in the bed\nreposed--not Bedford, but our friend Kate, fast asleep, with one arm\nover the bed-clothes, and her long red hair in a pigtail streaming\nover the pillow. I climbed up and treated her as Fatima had treated\nme, calling her in low, frightened tones over and over again. She woke\nat last, and sat up.\n\n\"'You sprites! What is the matter?' she exclaimed.\n\n\"I stumbled through an account of our misfortunes, in the middle of\nwhich the young lady lay down, and before it was ended I believe she\nwas asleep again. Poor Fatima, who saw nothing before us but to return\nto our room with all its terrors, here began to sob violently, which\nroused our friend once more, and she became full of pity.\n\n\"'You poor children!' she said, 'I'm so sleepy. I cannot get up and\ngo after the ghost now; besides, one might meet somebody. But you may\nget into bed if you like; there's plenty of room, and nothing to\nfrighten you.'\n\n\"In we both crept, most willingly. She gave us the long tail of her\nhair, and said, 'If you want me, pull. But go to sleep, if you\ncan!'--and, before she had well finished the sentence, her eyes closed\nonce more. In such good company a snoring ghost seemed a thing hardly\nto be realized. We held the long plait between us, and, clinging to it\nas drowning men to a rope, we soon slept also.\n\n\"When we returned to our room next day, there was no snoring to be\nheard, and in the full sunshine of a summer morning our fright seemed\nso completely a thing of the past, that I persuaded myself to suggest\nthat it might have been 'fancy' (Kate had already expressed her\ndeliberate opinion to this effect), to which Fatima, whose convictions\nwere of a more resolute type than mine, replied, 'What's the use of\ntrying to believe what's not true? I heard it; and shall know that I\nheard it, if I live till I'm a hundred.'\n\n\"In all correct ghost stories, when the hero comes down in the\nmorning, valiant, but exhausted from the terrors of the night, to\nbreakfast, his host invariably asks him how he slept. When we came\ndown, we found Kate and the Irishman alone together in the\nbreakfast-room. Now it certainly was in keeping with our adventure\nwhen he stepped forward, and, bowing profoundly, asked how we had\npassed the night; but, in spite of the gravity of his face, there was\na twinkle in the big brown eyes which showed us that we were being\nmade fun of; and I felt slightly indignant with our friend, who had\nfaithfully promised not to betray us to Miss Lucy, and might, I\nthought, have saved us from the ridicule of the Irishman. The rest of\nthe company began to assemble, however, and to our relief the subject\nwas dropped. But though the Irishman kept our secret, we had every\nreason to suspect that he did not forget it; he looked terribly\nroguish through breakfast, and was only kept in order by Kate's severe\nglances.\n\n\"'Always breathe through the nose,' he suddenly began. 'It moderates\nthe severity of the air, is less trying to the lungs, and prevents\nsnoring.'\n\n\"'Very true,' said the major, who was sensible, and liked instructive\nobservations.\n\n\"'It may be laid down as an axiom,' continued the Irishman, gravely,\n'that the man who snores is sure to disturb somebody; and also that\nthe man who doesn't snore till he dies, is not likely to live to be a\nsnoring ghost when he is dead.'\n\n\"Kate looked daggers. The major laughed, and said, 'Let me give you\nsome beef.' When he didn't understand a remark he always laughed, and\ngenerally turned the conversation to eatables, in which he was pretty\nsafe; for food is common ground, and a slight laugh answers most\nremarks, unless at a serious meeting or a visit of condolence. A\nlittle later the Irishman asked: 'What's the origin of the expression\nto stir up with a long pole?' which turned the conversation to wild\nbeasts. But he presently inquired: 'What's the meaning of putting a\nthing up the spout?'\n\n\"'Pawning it,' said the major, promptly.\n\n\"'People pawn their family jewels sometimes,' said Pat. 'Did you ever\nhear of anybody pawning the family ghosts?' he asked, suddenly turning\nto me. I gave a distressed 'No,' and he continued in a whisper, 'You\nnever saw a ghost up the spout?'\n\n\"But, before I could answer, he caught Kate's eye, and, making a\npenitent face, became silent.\n\n\"We were in the drawing-room after breakfast, when the Irishman passed\nthe window outside, whistling 'Kathleen Mavourneen.' We were sitting\nat Kate's feet, and she got up, and whispering, 'He's got something to\nshow you, but he wouldn't let me tell,' went out into the garden, we\nfollowing her.\n\n\"There we found the Irishman, with a long pole, which he was waving\ntriumphantly in the air. He bowed as we approached.\n\n\"'This, young ladies,' he said, 'is the original long pole spoken of\nat the breakfast-table. With this I am about to stir up and bring\nforth for your inspection the living and identical ghost whose snoring\ndisturbed your repose last night.'\n\n\"The little Irishman's jokes reassured me. I guessed that he had\nfound some clue to our mysterious noise; but with Fatima it was\notherwise. She had been too deeply frightened to recover so easily.\nShe clung tremblingly to me, as I was following him, and whispered\n'I'd rather not.'\n\n\"On her behalf I summoned courage to remonstrate.\n\n\"'If you please, sir,' I said, 'Fatima would rather not; and, if you\nplease, don't tease us any more.'\n\n\"The young lady added her entreaties, but they were not needed. The\ngood-natured little gentleman no sooner saw Fatima's real distress\nthan he lowered his pole, and sank upon his knees on the grass, with a\nface of genuine penitence.\n\n\"'I _am_ so sorry I've been tormenting you so!' he exclaimed. 'I\nforgot you were really frightened, and you see I knew it wasn't a\nghost.'\n\n\"'I heard it,' murmured Fatima resolutely, with her eyes half shut.\n\n\"'So did I,' said the Irishman, gaily; 'I've heard it dozens of times.\nIt's the owls.'\n\n\"We both exclaimed.\n\n\"'Ah!' he said, comically, 'I see you don't believe me! That's what\ncomes of telling so many small fibs. But it's true, I assure you. (And\nthe brown eyes did look particularly truthful.) Barn-door owls do make\na noise that is very like the snoring of an old man. And there are\nsome young ones who live in the spout at the corner of the wall of\nyour room. They're snoring and scrambling in and out of that spout all\nnight.'\n\n\"It was quite true, Ida, as we found, when Fatima was at last\npersuaded to visit the corner where the rooms had been pulled down,\nand where, decorated with ivy, the old spout formed a home for the\nsnoring owls. By the aid of the long pole he brought out a young one\nto our view--a shy, soft, lovely, shadow-tinted creature, ghostly\nenough to behold, who felt like an impalpable mass of fluff, utterly\nrefused to be kissed, and went savagely blinking back into his spout\nat the earliest possible opportunity. His snoring alarmed us no more.\"\n\n\"And the noise really was that?\" said Ida.\n\n\"It really was, my dear.\"\n\n\"It's a splendid story,\" said Ida; \"you see, I didn't go to sleep\n_this_ time. And what became of everybody, please? Did the red-haired\nyoung lady marry the Irishman?\"\n\n\"Very soon afterwards, my dear,\" said Mrs. Overtheway. \"We kept up\nour friendship, too, in after life; and I have many times amused their\nchildren with the story of the Snoring Ghost.\"\n\n\n\n\nREKA DOM.\n\n    \"What is home, and where, but with the loving?\"\n\nFELICIA HEMANS.\n\n\nAt last Ida was allowed to go out. She was well wrapped up, and\nescorted by Nurse in a short walk for the good of her health. It was\nnot very amusing, but the air was fresh and the change pleasant,\nalthough the street did not prove quite that happy region it had\nlooked from the nursery windows. Moreover, however strong one may\nfancy one has become indoors, the convalescent's first efforts out of\ndoors are apt to be as feeble as those of a white moth that has just\ncrept from the shelter of its cocoon, giddy with daylight, and\ntrembling in the open air. By-and-by this feeling passed away, and one\nafternoon Ida was allowed to go by herself into the garden, \"just for\na run.\"\n\nThe expression was metaphorical, for she was far from being able to\nrun; but she crept quietly up and down the walks, and gathered some\npolyanthuses, putting them to her face with that pleasure which the\ntouch of fresh flowers gives to an invalid. Then she saw that the\nhedge was budding, and that the gap through which she had scrambled\nwas filled up. Ida thought of the expedition and smiled. It had\ncertainly made her very ill, but--it had led to Mrs. Overtheway.\n\nThe little old lady did not come that day, and in the evening Ida was\nsent for by her uncle. She had not been downstairs in the evenings\nsince her illness. These interviews with the reserved old gentleman\nwere always formal, uncomfortable affairs, from which Ida escaped with\na sense of relief, and that evening--being weak with illness and\ndisappointed by Mrs. Overtheway's absence--her nervousness almost\namounted to terror.\n\nNurse did her best in the way of encouragement. It was true that Ida's\nuncle was not a merry gentleman, but there was such a nice dessert!\nWhat could a well-behaved young lady desire more than to wear her best\nfrock, and eat almonds and raisins in the dining-room, as if she were\nthe lady of the house?\n\n\"Though I am sorry for the child,\" Nurse confided to the butler when\nshe had left Ida with her uncle, \"for his looks are enough to frighten\na grown person, let alone a little girl. And do you go in presently,\nlike a good soul, if you can find an excuse, and let her see a\ncheerful face.\"\n\nBut before the kind-hearted old man-servant could find a plausible\npretext for intruding into the dining-room, and giving an encouraging\nsmile from behind his master's chair, Ida was in the nursery once\nmore.\n\nShe had honestly endeavoured to be good. She had made her curtsey at\nthe door without a falter--weak as she was. She had taken her place at\nthe head of the table with all dignity, and had accepted the almonds\nand raisins with sufficiently audible thanks. She had replied prettily\nenough to her uncle's inquiries after her health; and, anxious to keep\nup the conversation, had told him that the hedge was budding.\n\n\"_What's_ the matter with the hedge?\" he had asked rather sharply; and\nwhen Ida repeated her bit of spring news, he had not seemed to be\ninterested. It was no part of the gardener's work.\n\nIda relapsed into silence, and so did her uncle. But this was not all.\nHe had sharp eyes, and fierce bushy eyebrows, from under which he was\napt to scrutinize Ida in a way that seemed to scatter all her presence\nof mind. This night of all nights she found his eyes upon her oftener\nthan usual. Whenever she looked up he was watching her, and her\ndiscomfort increased accordingly. At last he broke the silence\nabruptly by saying:\n\n\"You were very sorry, child, were you not, when the news came of your\nfather's death?\"\n\nThe sudden introduction of this sacred subject made Ida's head reel.\n\n\"What?\" she cried, and could get no further.\n\n\"Have you forgotten already?\" the old gentleman said, almost\nreprovingly. \"You did not know him, it is true; but you must remember\nhearing that your poor father had been drowned at sea?\"\n\nIda's only reply was such a passionate outburst of weeping that her\nuncle rang the bell in helpless dismay, and was thankful when the old\nbutler lifted the child tenderly in his arms and carried her back to\nNurse. The old gentleman's feelings were more kindly than his looks,\nand he was really as much concerned as puzzled by the effect of his\nremarks. When the butler returned with the report that Ida was going\nquietly to bed, he sent her his \"love\" (the word seemed to struggle\nwith some difficulty from behind his neck-cloth), and all the\nremaining almonds and raisins.\n\n\"I can't eat them,\" said Ida, smiling feebly, for her head was aching,\n\"but it is very kind of him; and please tell Brown to tell him that I\nam very sorry, and please put the almonds and raisins into my box. I\nwill make a dolls feast with them, if ever I make dolls' feasts\nagain.\"\n\nWith which the weary little maid turned upon her pillow, and at last\nforgot her troubles in sleep.\n\nThe next morning Brown delivered a similar message from the old\ngentleman. He had gone away by an early train on business, but had\nleft Ida his love.\n\n\"It's very kind of him,\" said Ida, again. But she went sadly on with\nsome paper she was cutting into shapes. She was in low spirits this\nmorning.\n\nComfort was at hand, however. In the course of the day there came a\nmessage from Mrs. Overtheway, asking Nurse to allow Ida to go to tea\nwith her that evening. And Nurse consented.\n\nIda could hardly believe her senses when she found herself by the\nlittle old lady's own fireside. How dainty her room was! How full the\nbookshelves were! How many pictures hung upon the walls!\n\nAbove a little table, on which were innumerable pretty things, hung\ntwo pictures. One of these was a portrait of a man who, from his\napparent age, might have been the old lady's son, but that he was not\nat all like her. He might have been good-looking, though, Ida thought,\nand he had a kind, intelligent face, full of energy and\nunderstanding, and that is better still. Close under his portrait hung\na little sketch. It was of a road running by a river. Opposite to the\nriver was a house and some trees. It was a pretty sketch, Ida thought,\nand the road looked interesting, as some roads do in pictures--making\none wish to get into the frame and walk down them to see whither they\nlead. Below the sketch were some curious-looking characters written in\nink, and of these Ida could make nothing.\n\nTea was soon ready. It was spread out on a little table by itself. The\nwhite cloth seemed to Ida the whitest she had ever seen, the silver\nand glass glittered, the china was covered with a rosebud pattern, and\na reading-lamp threw a clear soft light over all. The tea, the cream,\nthe brown bread and butter, the fresh eggs, and the honey--all were of\nthe very best--even the waiting-maid was pretty, and had something of\nthe old lady's smile.\n\nWhen she had finished her duties by taking away the things, and\nputting the tea-table into a corner, the two friends drew up to the\nfire.\n\n\"You look better for tea, my child,\" said the little old lady. \"Do you\neat enough at home?\"\n\n\"As much as I can,\" said Ida, \"but I am more hungry when somebody\nelse has tea with me. There very seldom was anybody till you came\nthough. Only once or twice Lady Cheetham's housekeeper has been to\ntea. She is Nurse's father's first cousin, and 'quite the lady,' Nurse\nsays. So she won't let her have tea in the kitchen, so both she and\nNurse have tea in the nursery, and we have lots of tea-cakes and jam,\nand Nurse keeps saying, 'Help yourself, Miss Ida! Make yourself at\nhome, Mrs. Savory!' And, you know, at other times, she's always\ntelling me not to be all night over my tea. So I generally eat a good\ndeal then, and I often laugh, for Nurse and Mrs. Savory are so funny\ntogether. But Mrs. Savory's very kind, and last time she came she\nbrought me a pincushion, and the time before she gave me a Spa mug and\ntwo apples.\"\n\nMrs. Overtheway laughed, too, at Ida's rambling account, and the two\nwere in high good-humour.\n\n\"What shall I do to amuse you?\" asked the little old lady.\n\n\"You couldn't tell me another story?\" said Ida, with an accent that\nmeant, \"I hope you can!\"\n\n\"I would, gladly, my dear, but I don't know what to tell you about;\"\nand she looked round the room as if there were stories in the\nfurniture which perhaps there were. Ida's eyes followed her, and then\nshe remembered the picture, and said:\n\n\"Oh! would you please tell me what the writing means under that pretty\nlittle sketch?\"\n\nThe little old lady smiled rather sadly, and looked at the sketch in\nsilence for a few moments. Then she said:\n\n\"It is Russian, my dear. Their letters are different from ours. The\nwords are 'Reka Dom' and they mean 'River House.'\"\n\nIda gazed at the drawing with increased interest.\n\n\"Oh, do you remember anything about it? If you would tell me about\n_that_!\" she cried.\n\nBut Mrs. Overtheway was silent again. She was looking down, and\ntwisting some of the rings upon her little hand, and Ida felt ashamed\nof having asked.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, imploringly. \"I was very rude, dear\nMrs. Overtheway; tell me what you like, please.\"\n\n\"You are a good child,\" said the little old lady, \"a very good child,\nmy dear. I _do_ remember so much about that house, that I fall into\nday-dreams when I look at it. It brings back the memories of a great\ndeal of pleasure and a great deal of pain. But it is one advantage of\nbeing old, little Ida, that Time softens the painful remembrances, and\nleaves us the happy ones, which grow clearer every day.\"\n\n\"Is it about yourself?\" Ida asked, timidly. She had not quite\nunderstood the little old lady's speech; indeed, she did not\nunderstand many things that Mrs. Overtheway said, but they were very\nsatisfactory companions for all that.\n\n\"Yes, it is about myself. And since there is a dear child who cares\nabout old Mrs. Overtheway, and her prosy stories, and all that befell\nher long ago,\" said the little old lady, smiling affectionately at\nIda, \"I will tell her the story--my story--the story of Reka Dom.\"\n\n\"Oh, how good of you!\" cried Ida.\n\n\"There is not much merit in it,\" said the little old lady. \"The story\nis as much for myself as you. I tell myself bits of it every evening\nafter tea, more so now than I used to do. I look far back, and I\nendeavour to look far forward. I try to picture a greater happiness,\nand companionship more perfect than any I have known; and when I shall\nbe able to realize them, I shall have found a better Home than Reka\nDom.\"\n\nIda crept to the little old lady's feet, and softly stroked the\nslipper that rested on the fender. Then, while the March wind howled\nbeyond the curtains, she made herself a cosy corner by the fire, and\ncomposed herself to hear the story.\n\n\"I remember,\" said Mrs. Overtheway. \"I remember Reka Dom. It was our\nnew home.\n\n\"Circumstances had made it necessary that we should change our\nresidence, and the new home was to be in a certain quiet little town,\nnot much bigger than some big villages--a town of pebble streets and\nsmall shops, silent, sunny, and rather dull--on the banks of a river.\n\n\"My health at this time was far from robust; but there is compensation\neven for being delicate in that spring-time of youth, when the want of\nphysical strength is most irksome. If evening parties are forbidden,\nand long walks impossible, the fragile member of the family is, on the\nother hand, the first to be considered in the matter of small\ncomforts, or when there is an opportunity for 'change of air.' I\nexperienced this on the occasion when our new home was chosen. It had\nbeen announced to us that our father and mother were going away for\none night, and that we were to be very good in the absence of those\nauthorized keepers of the peace. We had not failed ourselves to\nenlarge this information by the discovery that they were going to the\nlittle town by the river, to choose the house that was to be our home;\nbut it was not till the night before their departure that I was told\nthat I was to go with them. I had been unusually drooping, and it was\nsupposed that the expedition would revive me. My own joy was\nunbounded, and that of my brothers and sisters was hardly less. They\nwere generously glad for my sake, and they were glad, also, that one\nof the nursery conclave should be on the spot when the great choice\nwas made. We had a shrewd suspicion that in the selection of a house\nour elders would be mainly influenced by questions of healthy\nsituation, due drainage, good water supply, moderate rent, and so\nforth; to the neglect of more important considerations, such as odd\ncorners for hide-and-seek, deep window-seats, plenty of cupboards, and\na garden adapted to the construction of bowers rather than to the\ncultivation of vegetables. I do not think my hopes of influencing the\nparental decision were great; but still we all felt that it was well\nthat I should be there, and my importance swelled with every piece of\nadvice I received from the rest of the party.\n\n\"'It must be a big house, but, of course, that adds to the expense,'\nsaid one of the older boys, who prided himself upon being more\ngrown-up in his views than the rest, and considering the question from\nan elderly point of view. 'But if you don't take it out one way, you\nhave it another,' he continued. A manly-sounding sentence, which\nimpressed us all. 'Don't think about smartness, Mary,' he went on,\nwith a grand air of renouncing vanities; 'fine entrance, you know, and\nfront door. But a good back yard, if possible, and some empty\nouthouses for carpenters' shops; and if you could meet with a place\nwith a few old boxes and barrels lying about, for rafts on the river\nand so forth, it would be a good thing.'\n\n\"'I want a tidy box for a new baby-house, _dreadfully_,' added a\nsister.\n\n\"'I hope there'll be deep window-places,' sighed the luxurious Fatima,\n'with print patchwork cushions, like those at the farm. And I hope\nsome of them will face west, for the sunsets.'\n\n\"'Above all'--and it was the final and most impressive charge I\nreceived--'whatever else is wanting, let us have two tall trees for a\nswing.'\n\n\"Laden with responsibility, but otherwise light-hearted enough, I set\nout with my parents by the early coach, which was to put us down about\nmid-day in the little town by the river.\n\n\"I liked travelling with my father. What a father he was! But, indeed,\nhe was an object of such special devotion to me, and his character\nexercised so strong an influence over my young days, that I think, my\ndear Ida, that I must take the old woman's privilege of\ndiscursiveness, and tell you something about him.\n\n\"I remember that he was a somewhat mysterious personage in our young\neyes. We knew little of his early life, and what we did know only\nenhanced the romantic mystery which we imagined to hang round it. We\nknew that he had seen many foreign lands, and in those days much\ntravelling was rare. This accounted for the fact that, absent and\nsomewhat unpractical as he was at home, he was invaluable on a\njourney, making arrangements, and managing officials with the\nprecision of old habit. Where he had learnt his peculiar courtesy and\nhelpfulness with those under his charge was less obvious. My mother\nsaid he had been accustomed to 'good society' in his youth, though we\nlived quietly enough now. We knew that, as a lad, he had been at sea,\nand sailors are supposed to be a handy and gentle-mannered race with\nthe weak and dependent. Where else he had been, and what he had done,\nwe did not exactly know; but I think we vaguely believed him to have\nbeen concerned in not a few battles by land and sea; to be deep in\nsecrets of state, and to have lived on terms of intimacy with several\nkings and queens. His appearance was sufficiently striking to favour\nour dreams on his behalf. He had a tall, ungainly figure, made more\nungainly by his odd, absent ways; but withal he was an unmistakable\ngentleman. I have heard it said of him that he was a man from whom no\nerrors in taste could be feared, and with whom no liberties could ever\nbe taken. He had thick hair of that yellow over which age seems to\nhave no power, and a rugged face, wonderfully lighted up by eyes of\nrare germander blue. His hair sometimes seemed to me typical of his\nmind and tastes, which Time never robbed of their enthusiasm.\n\n\"With age and knowledge the foolish fancies I wove about my father\nmelted away, but the peculiar affection I felt for him, over and above\nmy natural love as a daughter, only increased as I grew up. Our tastes\nwere harmonious, and we always understood each other; whereas Fatima\nwas apt to be awed by his stateliness, puzzled by his jokes, and at\ntimes provoked by his eccentricities. Then I was never very robust in\nmy youth; and the refined and considerate politeness which he made a\npoint of displaying in his own family were peculiarly grateful to me.\nThat good manners (like charity) should begin at home, was a pet\nprinciple with him, and one which he often insisted upon to us.\n\n\"'If you will take my advice, young people,' he would say, 'you will\nbe careful never to let your sisters find other young gentlemen more\nready and courteous, nor your brothers find other young ladies more\ngentle and obliging than those at home.'\n\n\"My father certainly practised what he preached, and it would not have\nbeen easy to find a more kind and helpful travelling companion than\nthe one with whom my mother and I set forth that early morning in\nsearch of our new abode.\n\n\"I was just becoming too much tired to care to look any longer out of\nthe window, when the coach rumbled over the pebbly street into the\ncourtyard of the 'Saracen's Head.'\n\n\"I had never stayed at an inn before. What a palace of delights it\nseemed to me! It is true that the meals were neither better nor better\ncooked than those at home, and that the little room devoted to my use\nwas far from being as dainty as that which Fatima and I habitually\nshared; but the keen zest of novelty pervaded everything, and the\nfaded chintz and wavy looking-glass of No. 25 are pleasant memories\nstill. Moreover, it had one real advantage over my own bedroom. High\nup, at the back of the house, it looked out and down upon the river.\nHow the water glittered and sparkled! The sun was reflected from its\nripples as if countless hosts of tiny naïads each held a mirror to\ncatch his rays. My home had been inland, and at some distance from a\nriver, and the sight of water was new and charming to me. I could see\npeople strolling along the banks; and then a boat carrying sails of a\nrich warm brown came into view and passed slowly under my eye, with a\nstately grace and a fair wind. I was watching her with keen interest,\nwhen I was summoned to dinner.\n\n\"Here, again, novelty exercised its charm. At home I think I may say\nthat the nursery party without exception regarded dinner in the light\nof a troublesome necessity of existence. We were apt to grudge the\nlength and formalities of the meal; to want to go out, or not to want\nto come in; or possibly the dining-room had been in use as a kite\nmanufactory, or a juvenile artist's studio, or a doll's dressmaker's\nestablishment, and we objected to make way for the roast meat and\npudding. But on this occasion I took an interest in the dignities of\nthe dinner-table, and examined the plates and dishes, and admired the\nold-fashioned forks and spoons, and puzzled over the entwined initials\non their handles.\n\n\"After dinner we went out into the town, and looked through several\nhouses which were to let. My high hopes and eager interest in the\nmatter were soon quenched by fatigue; but faithful to my promise, I\nexamined each house in turn. None of them proved satisfactory to my\nparents, and they were even less so to me. They were all new, all\ncommonplace, and all equally destitute of swing-trees, interesting\ncorners, deep window-seats, or superannuated boxes. Heat, fatigue, and\ndisappointment at last so overpowered me that my pale face attracted\nnotice, and my father brought me back to the inn. He carried me\nupstairs to the sofa, and, pointing out a bookshelf for my amusement,\nand telling me to order tea if I wished for it, went back to my\nmother.\n\n\"It was a shabby little collection of volumes, that parlour library in\nthe 'Saracen's Head.' There was an old family Bible, a torn copy of\n'Culpepper's 'Herbal,' the Homilies in inexpressibly greasy black\ncalf, a book of songs, a volume called 'Evelina,' which seemed chiefly\nremarkable for dashes and notes of admiration, and--the book I chose.\n\n\"The book I chose would look very dull in your eyes, I dare say, my\ndear Ida; you who live in an age of bright, smart story-books, with\nclear type, coloured pictures, and gorgeous outsides. You don't know\nwhat small, mean, inartistic 'cuts' enlivened your grandmother's\nnursery library, that is, when the books were illustrated at all. You\nhave no idea how very little amusement was blended with the\ninstruction, and how much instruction with the amusement in our\nplaybooks then, and how few there were of them, and how precious those\nfew were! You can hardly imagine what a treasure I seemed to have\nfound in a volume which contained several engravings the size of the\npage, besides many small wood-cuts scattered through the letter-press.\nI lost sight alike of fatigue and disappointment, as I pored over the\npictures, and read bits here and there.\n\n\"And such charming pictures there were! With quaint anglers in\nsteeple-crowned hats, setting forth to fish, or breakfasting under a\ntree (untrammelled by the formalities of a nursery meal), or bringing\ntheir spoils to a wayside inn with a painted fish upon the sign-board,\nand a hostess in a high hat and a stiff-bustled dress at the door.\nThen there were small wood-cuts which one might have framed for a\ndoll's house; portraits of fish of all kinds, not easily\ndistinguishable by the unpractised eye; and nicer wood-cuts still of\ncountry scenes, and country towns, and almost all of these with a\nriver in them. By the time that my father and mother returned, I had\ncome to the conclusion that the bank of a river was, of all\nsituations, the most desirable for one's home, and had built endless\nbowers in the air like that in which the anglers are seated in the\npicture entitled 'The Farewell;' and had imagined myself in a tall hat\nand a stiff-bustled dress cooking fish for my favourite brothers after\nthe recipes in Walton and Cotton's 'Complete Angler.'\n\n\"They came back with disappointment on their faces. They had not got\na house, but my mother had got a headache, and we sat down to tea a\ndispirited party.\n\n\"It is sometimes fortunate as well as remarkable, how soon everybody\nknows everything about everybody else, especially in a small town. As\nthe tea-things went downstairs, our landlord came up to help us in our\ndifficulty. Had the gentleman succeeded in obtaining a house? If none\nof the new lot suited him, the landlord believed that one or more of\nolder date were to let near the river. It was not the fashionable\nquarter, but there had been well-to-do people and some good\nsubstantial residences there.\n\n\"Our hopes rose again, and the idea of an old and substantial\nresidence in an unfashionable quarter was so much more favourable to\nnursery interests than the smart gimcrack houses at which we had been\nlooking, that I should have been anxious to explore that part of the\ntown to which he directed us, even if it had not possessed a charm\nthat was now pre-eminent in my eyes. It was near the river.\n\n\"My mother was too much tired to attempt further investigations, but I\nhad completely recovered from my fatigues, and was allowed to go with\nmy father on the new search. He and I were very good company, despite\nthe difference in age between us. We were never in each other's way,\nand whether we chatted or did not speak, we were happy together, and\nenjoyed ourselves in our respective fashions.\n\n\"It was a lovely evening. Hand in hand we turned out of the 'Saracen's\nHead' into the shingly street, took the turning which led to the\nunfashionable quarter, and strolled on and on, in what Scott calls\n'social silence.' I was very happy. It was not only a lovely\nevening--it was one of these when the sunlight seems no longer mere\nsunlight, but has a kind of magical glow, as if a fairy spell had been\ncast over everything; when all houses look interesting--all country\nlanes inviting--when each hedge, or ditch, or field seems a place made\nto play in at some wonderful game that should go on for years.\n\n\"As we wandered on, we passed a line of small bright-looking houses,\nwhich strongly caught my fancy. Each had its gay little garden, its\nshrubbery of lilac, holly, or laurustinus, and its creeper-covered\nporch. They looked so compact and cosy, so easy to keep tidy, so snug\nand sunny, that one fancied the people who lived in them must be\nhappy, and wondered who they were.\n\n\"'Oh, father!' I exclaimed, 'what delightful houses!'\n\n\"'They are very pretty, my dear,' he answered; 'but they are much too\nsmall for us; besides which, they are all occupied.'\n\n\"I sighed, and we were passing on, when I held him back with another\nexclamation.\n\n\"'Oh! _look_ at the carnations!' For in one of the gardens large\nclumps of splendid scarlet cloves caught my eye.\n\n\"My father humoured me, and we drew near to the laurustinus hedge, and\nlooked over into the gay little garden. As we looked, we became\nconscious of what appeared like a heap or bundle of clothing near one\nof the beds, which, on lifting itself up, proved to be a tall slender\nlady of middle age, who, with her dress tucked neatly round her, a big\nprint hood on her head, and a trowel in her hand, was busily\nadministering such tender little attentions as mothers will lavish on\ntheir children, and garden lovers on their flowers. She was not alone\nin the garden, as we soon perceived. A shorter and stouter and younger\nlady sat knitting by the side of a gentleman in a garden-chair, who\nfrom some defect in his sight, wore a large green shade, which hid the\ngreater part of his face. The shade was made of covered pasteboard,\nand was large and round, and so very like a lamp shade, that I hardly\never look at one of those modern round globe lamps, my dear, if it\nhas a green shade, without being reminded of old Mr. Brooke.\n\n\"'Was that his name?' Ida asked.\n\n\"'Yes, my dear; but that we did not know till afterwards. When the\ngood lady lifted herself up, she saw us, and seemed startled. My\nfather raised his hat, and apologized politely. 'My little girl was so\nmuch taken with your carnations, madam,' he said, 'that we made bold\nto come near enough to look at them, not knowing that any one was in\nthe garden.'\n\n\"She seemed rather flustered, but pushed back her hood, and made a\nstiff little curtsey in answer to my father's bow, and murmured\nsomething about our being welcome.\n\n\"'Would you care to have some, my dear?' she added, looking at me. I\ngave a delighted assent, and she had gathered two lovely carnations,\nwhen we heard a quavering voice from under the green shade inquire--\n\n\"'What is it?'\n\n\"Our friend was at the old gentleman's side in a moment, speaking very\ndistinctly into his ear, as if he were deaf, whereby we heard her\nanswer,\n\n\"'It's a gentleman and his little daughter, James, admiring our\ncarnations, and I am gathering a few for the young lady, dear James.'\n\n\"'Quite right, quite right,' he croaked. 'Anything that we have.\nAnything that we have.'\n\n\"It was a great satisfaction to me afterwards to remember that my\nfather had thanked these good people 'properly,' as I considered. As\nfor myself, I had only been able to blush and stammer out something\nthat was far from expressing my delight with the lovely nosegay I\nreceived. Then the slender lady went back to her gardening. Her sister\ntook up the knitting which she had laid down, the old gentleman nodded\nhis lamp-shade in the direction where he supposed us to be and said,\n'Good evening, sir, Good evening, miss;' and we went our way.\n\n\"The road wound on and on, and down and down, until we found ourselves\non the edge of the river. A log lay conveniently on the bank, and\nthere we seated ourselves. The tide was out, and the river bed was a\nbed of mud except for a narrow stream of water that ran down the\nmiddle. But, ah! how the mud glistened in the evening sunshine which\nwas reflected on it in prismatic colours. Little figures were dotted\nhere and there over its surface, and seawards the masts of some\nvessels loomed large through the shining haze.\n\n\"'How beautiful everything looks this evening!' I exclaimed.\n\n\"'I see them walking in an air of glory,' murmured my father,\ndreamily.\n\n\"He was quoting from a favourite old poem, which begins--\n\n    'They are all gone into a world of light,\n    And I alone sit lingering here.'\n\n\"This 'air of glory,' indeed, was over everything. The mud and the\ntide pools, the dark human figures, the black and white seagulls that\nsat like onyx pebbles on the river bed, the stream that spread\nseawards like a silver scroll, the swans that came sailing, sailing\ndown the stream with just such a slow and stately pace as white-winged\nships might have come down the river with the tide, to pass (as the\nswans did pass) into that 'world of light,' that shining seaward haze,\nwhere your eye could not follow them unless shaded by your hand.\n\n\"I do not quite know how long we sat gazing before us in silent\nenjoyment. Neither do I know what my father's thoughts were, as he sat\nwith his hands clasped on his knees and his blue eyes on the river.\nFor my own part, I fancied myself established in one of the little\nhouses as 'hostess,' with a sign-board having a fish painted upon it\nhanging outside the door, and a bower of woodbine, sweet-briar,\njessamine, and myrtle commanding a view of the river. The day dream\nwas broken by my father's voice.\n\n\"'Mary, my dear, we must go about our business, or what will your\nmother say to us? We must see after these houses. We can't live on the\nriver's bank.'\n\n\"'I wish we could,' I sighed; and though he had risen and turned away,\nI lingered still. At this moment my father exclaimed--\n\n\"'Bless my soul!' and I jumped up and turned round.\n\n\"He was staring at a wall with a gateway in it, enclosing a house and\ngarden on the other side of the road. On the two gateposts were\nprinted in black Roman letters two words that I could not\nunderstand--_Reka Dom_.\n\n\"'What does it mean?' I asked.\n\n\"'Reka Dom?' said my father thoughtfully (and he pronounced it _Rayka\nDome_). 'It is Russian. It means River House. Very curious! I suppose\nthe people who live here are Russians. It's a nice situation--a lovely\nview--_lovely_!' and he had turned round to the river, but I caught\nhis arm.\n\n\"'Father, dear, no one lives here. Look!' and I pointed to a board\nbeyond the gateway, which stated in plain English that the house was\nto let.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"By the time that we returned to my mother, Reka Dom was to all\nintents and purposes our home.\n\n\"It is true that the house was old, rambling, and out of repair, and\nthat what we heard of the landlord was not encouraging. He was rich,\nwe were told, but miserly; and 'a very queer old gentleman,' whose\noddness almost amounted to insanity. He had 'made himself so\nunpleasant' to various people who had thought of taking the house,\nthat they drew back, and Reka Dom had been untenanted for some time.\nThe old woman who took care of it, and from whom we got this\ninformation, prophesied further that he would 'do nothing to the old\nplace. He'd let it fall about his ears first.'\n\n\"It is also true that standing in the garden (which in its rambling,\ndisorderly way was charming, and commanded a lovely view), my father\nrubbed his head ruefully, and said:\n\n\"'You know, Mary, your mother's chief objection to our latest home\nwas that the grounds were so much too large for our means of keeping\nthem in order; and this garden is the larger of the two, I fear.'\n\n\"And he did not seem to derive proportionate comfort from my reply.\n\n\"'But, father dear, you know you needn't keep it in order, and then we\ncan have it to play in.'\n\n\"And yet we took Reka Dom.\n\n\"The fact is that my father and I took a fancy to the place. On my\nside this is easily to be accounted for. If all the other houses at\nwhich we had looked had proved the direct reverse of what I (on behalf\nof myself and my brothers and sisters) was in search of, Reka Dom in a\nremarkable degree answered our requirements. To explore the garden was\nlike a tour in fairy land. It was oddly laid out. Three grass-plots or\nlawns, one behind another, were divided by hedges of honeysuckle and\nsweet-briar. The grass was long, the flower-borders were borders of\ndesolation, where crimson pæonies and some other hardy perennials made\nthe best of it, but the odour of the honeysuckle was luxuriously sweet\nin the evening air. And what a place for bowers! The second lawn had\ngreater things in store for me. There, between two tall elm trees hung\na swing. With a cry of delight I seated myself, seized the ropes, and\ngave a vigorous push. But the impetus was strong, and the ropes were\nrotten, and I and the swing came to the ground together. This did not\ndeter me, however, from exploring the third lawn, where I made a\ndiscovery to which that of the swing was as nothing.\n\n\"It was not merely that a small path through the shrubbery led me into\na little enclosed piece of ground devoted to those many-shaped,\nbox-edged little flower-beds characteristic of 'children's\ngardens,'--it was not alone that the beds were shaped like letters,\nand that there was indisputably an M among them--but they were six in\nnumber. Just one apiece for myself and my brothers and sisters! And\nthough families of six children are not so very uncommon as to make it\nimprobable that my father's predecessor should have had the same\nnumber of young ones as himself, the coincidence appeared to my mind\nalmost supernatural. It really seemed as if some kind old fairy had\nconjured up the whole place for our benefit. And--bless the good\ngodmother!--to crown all, there were two old tea-chests and a\nbottomless barrel in the yard.\n\n\"Doubtless many causes influenced my father in _his_ leaning towards\nReka Dom, and he did not confide them to me. But I do truly believe\nthat first and foremost of the attractions was its name. To a real\nhearty lover of languages there is a charm in the sight of a strange\ncharacter, new words, a yet unknown tongue, which cannot be explained\nto those who do not share the taste. And perhaps next to the mystic\nattraction of words whose meaning is yet hidden, is to discover traces\nof a foreign language in some unexpected and unlikely place. Russian\nis not extensively cultivated; my father's knowledge of it was but\nslight, and this quiet little water-side town an unlikely place for an\ninscription in that language. It was curious, and then interesting,\nand then the quaint simple title of the house took his fancy. Besides\nthis, though he could not but allow that there was reason in my\nmother's views on the subject of large grounds in combination with one\nman-of-all-work, he liked plenty of space and shrubbery where he could\nwander about--his hands behind his back--without being disturbed; and\nfor his own part he had undoubtedly felt more pleasure in the\npossession of large grounds than annoyance at seeing them neglected.\nSo the garden tempted him. Finally, there was a room opening upon a\nlaurel walk, which had at one time been a library. The shelves--old,\ncommon, dirty and broken--were still there, and on the most secure of\nthem the housekeeper kept her cheese and candles, and an old shawl and\nbonnet.\n\n\"'The place is made for us!' I exclaimed on my return from discovering\nthe old barrel and tea-chests. My father was standing in the library\nlooking out upon the garden, and he did not say No.\n\n\"From the old woman we learnt something of the former tenants. She was\na good-natured old soul, with an aggrieved tone of voice, due probably\nto the depressing effects of keeping an empty house for a cantankerous\nlandlord. The former tenant's name was Smith, she said (unmistakably\nEnglish this!). But his lady was a _Roosian_, she believed. They had\nlived in _Roosia_, and some of the children, having been born there,\nwere little _Roosians_, and had _Roosian_ names. She could not speak\nherself, having no knowledge of the country, but she had heard that\nthe _Roosians_ were heathens, though Mr. Smith and his family went\nregularly to church. They had lived by a river, she believed, and\ntheir old home was called by the same outlandish name they had given\nto this. She had heard that it meant a house by the water-side, but\ncould not say, knowing no language but her own, and having (she was\nthankful to say) found it sufficient for all purposes. She knew that\nbefore Mr. Smith's time the house was called Montague Mount, and there\nwas some sense in that name. Though what the sense was, she did not\noffer to explain.\n\n\"'Please, please take it!' I whispered in a pause of the conversation!\n'there are six little gardens, and--'\n\n\"My father broke in with mock horror on his face: 'Don't speak of six\ngardens!' he exclaimed. 'The one will condemn the place, I fear, but\nwe must go home and consult your mother.'\n\n\"I suppose we did consult her.\n\n\"I know we described all the charms of the house and garden, and\npassed rather a poor examination as to their condition, and what might\nbe expected from the landlord. That my father endeavoured to conceal\nhis personal bias, and that I made no secret of mine. At last my\nmother interrupted some elaborately practical details by saying in\nher gentle voice--\n\n\"'I think choosing a home is something like choosing a companion for\nlife. It is chiefly important to like it. There must be faults\neverywhere. Do you take to the place, my dear?'\n\n\"'I like it certainly,' said my father. 'But the question is not what\nI like, but what you like.'\n\n\"Then I knew it was settled, and breathed freely. For though my father\nalways consulted my mother's wishes, she generally contrived to choose\nwhat she knew he would prefer. And she chose Reka Dom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Henceforward good luck seemed to follow our new home.\n\n\"First, as to the landlord. The old woman had certainly not\nexaggerated his oddity. But one of his peculiarities was a most\nfortunate one for us. He was a bibliomaniac--a lover and collector of\nvaluable and curious books. When my father called on him to arrange\nabout the house, he found him sitting almost in rags, apparently\ndining upon some cheese-parings, and surrounded by a library, the\nvalue of which would have fed and clothed him with comfort for an\nalmost indefinite period. Upon the chair behind him sat a large black\ncat with yellow eyes.\n\n\"When my father was ushered in, he gazed for a moment in silent\nastonishment at the unexpected sight. Books in shelf after shelf up to\nthe ceiling, and piled in heaps upon the floor. As he stood\nspeechless, the little old man put down the plate, gathered his ragged\ndressing-gown about him, and, followed by the cat, scrambled across\nthe floor and touched his arm.\n\n\"'You look at books as if you loved them?' he said.\n\n\"My father sighed as if a spell had been broken.\n\n\"'I am nearly half a century old,' he said, 'and I do not remember the\nday when I did not love them.'\n\n\"He confessed afterwards to my mother that not less than two hours\nelapsed before Reka Dom was so much as spoken of. Then his new\nacquaintance was as anxious to secure him for a tenant as he had been\nto take the house.\n\n\"'Put down on paper what you think wants doing, and it shall be done,'\nwas the old gentleman's liberal order on the subject of repairs.\n'Lord! Lord!' he went on, 'it's one thing to have you, and another\nthing to put the house right for men who don't know an Elzevir from an\nannual in red silk. One fellow came here who would have given me five\npounds more than I wanted for the place; but he put his vile hat upon\nmy books. Lord! Lord!'\n\n\"The old man's strongest effort in my father's favour, however, was\nthe proposal of a glass of wine. He seemed to have screwed himself up\nto the offer, and to be proportionately relieved when it was declined.\n\n\"'You're quite right,' he said, frankly; 'my wine is not so good as my\nbooks. Come and see them, whenever you like.'\n\n\"'The bookshelves shall be repaired, sir,' was his final promise in\nanswer to a hint from my father, who (it being successful, and he\nbeing a very straight-forward man) was ever afterwards ashamed of this\npiece of diplomacy. 'And the fire-place must be seen to. Lord! Lord! A\nman can live anywhere, but valuable books must be taken care of. Would\nyou believe it? I have a fire in this room three times a week in bad\nweather. And fuel is terribly dear, terribly dear. And that slut in\nthe kitchen burns as much as if she had the care of the Vatican\nLibrary. She said she couldn't roast the meat without. “Then give me\ncold meat!” I said; but she roasts and boils all the same. So last\nweek I forbade the butcher the house, and we've lived on cheese ever\nsince, and _that's_ eightpence a pound. Food is terribly dear here,\nsir; everything is dear. It's enough to ruin a man. And you've got a\nfamily. Lord! Lord! How a man can keep a family and books together, I\ncan't imagine. However, I suppose children live chiefly on porridge.'\n\n\"Which supposition served for long as a household joke against my\nbrothers, whose appetite for roast meat was not less than that of\nother healthy boys of the period.\n\n\"It was a happy moment when my father came back from this interview,\nand Reka Dom was fairly ours. But a more delightful one was that in\nwhich I told the successful result of my embassy to the nursery\nconclave. I certainly had not the remotest claim to credit in the\nmatter, but I received an ovation proportionate to the good news I\nbrought. I told my story skilfully, and made the six gardens the\ncrowning point; at which climax my brother and sisters raised a shout\nthat so far exceeded the average of even nursery noises, that my\nmother hurried to the spot, where our little sister Phil flung herself\ninto her arms, and almost sobbing with excitement, cried--\n\n\"'Oh, Mother dear! we're _hooraying_ for Reka Dom!'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was sagely prophesied by our nurse and others that we should soon\nbe tired of our new fancy, and find 'plenty to complain of' in Reka\nDom as elsewhere. (It is nursery wisdom to chasten juvenile enthusiasm\nby such depressing truths.) And undoubtedly both people and places are\napt to disappoint one's expectations on intimate acquaintance; but\nthere are people and places who keep love always, and such an one was\nReka Dom.\n\n\"I hardly know what to tell you of it, Ida. The happy years we spent\nthere were marked by no wonderful occurrences, and were not enlivened\nby any particular gaiety. Beyond our own home our principal treat was\nto take tea in the snug little house where we made our first\nacquaintances. Those good ladies proved kind friends to us. Their buns\nwere not to be surpassed, and they had pale albums, and faded\ntreasures of the preceding generation, which it was our delight to\noverhaul. The two sisters lived with their invalid brother, and that\nwas the household. Their names were Martha and Mary, and they\ncherished a touching bit of sentiment in reference to the similarity\nbetween their circumstances and those of the Family of Bethany.\n\n\"'I think it reminds us of what we ought to be, my dear,' Miss Mary\nsaid to me one day. 'Only it is I who should have been called Martha,\nfor Martha is far more spiritually minded.' Humility was the most\nprominent virtue in the character of these good ladies, and they\ncarried it almost to excess.\n\n\"I remember, as a child, thinking that even the holy sisters of\nBethany could hardly have been more good than the Misses Brooke, but I\nwas quite unable to connect any sentiment with the invalid brother. He\nspoke little and did less, and yet his sisters continually quoted his\nsayings and criticisms, and spoke of his fine taste and judgment; but\nof all that he was supposed to say, only a few croaking common-places\never met our ears.\n\n\"'Dear James was so much pleased with that little translation you\nshowed me,' or 'Dear James hopes that his young friends keep up their\npractising. He considers music such a resource,' etc., etc.\n\n\"I believe they did hold conversations with him in which he probably\nassented to their propositions, and they persuaded themselves that he\nwas very good company. And, indeed, he may have been all that they\nbelieved; I can only say that to me dear James's remarks never\nexceeded, 'Good-day, Miss. How are your excellent parents?' or some\nsimilar civility. I really was afraid of him. There is something\nappalling in a hoarse voice coming from under a green shade, and\nconnected with eyes you cannot meet, and features that are always\nhidden. Beyond that shade we never saw to the day of his death.\n\n\"This occurred about four years after we first knew them. I well\nremember the visit of condolence on which I accompanied my mother, the\nbitter grief of the sisters, and the slow dropping of Miss Mary's\ntears on to her black dress. Wonderful indeed is love! The most\ntalented and charming companion in the world could not have filled to\nthem the place of the helpless, uninteresting invalid who had passed\naway.\n\n\"The Misses Brooke caused a commotion in the gossiping world of our\nlittle town by going to the funeral. It was not the custom for ladies\nto go to funerals, and, as a general rule, the timid sisters would not\nhave ventured to act against public opinion; but on this occasion they\nwere resolute. To hear the voice of authority meet them with the very\nwords wherewith Divine lips had comforted those other sisters, would\ncomfort them, as nothing else could. I remember how from a window we\nwatched the funeral with childish awe and curiosity--the thrill with\nwhich we heard a maid announce 'the coffin,' and caught sight of the\nflapping pall, and tried to realize that old Mr. Brooke was\nunderneath. Then close behind it came the two figures we knew so well,\nveiled, black, and bent, and clinging together in the agony of that\nstruggle between faith and loss which every loving soul is some time\ncalled on to endure. As we leant out of the open window, crying\nbitterly in sympathy with them, and with the gloomy excitement of the\noccasion, they raised themselves a little and walked more steadily.\nThe Rector's clear voice was cutting the air with the pathos of an\nunusual sympathy.\n\n     'I am the Resurrection and the Life--saith the Lord.'\n\n\"I understood then, and have never wondered since, how it was that the\nMisses Brooke braved the gossip of the neighbourhood, and followed\ntheir brother's body to the grave.\n\n\"These good people were, as I have said, our chief friends; but Reka\nDom itself afforded us ample amusement. The six children who had lived\nthere before us were a source of unfailing interest. The old woman of\nthe house remained about the place for a short time in the capacity of\ncharwoman, and she suffered many inquiries on our part as to the\nnames, ages, and peculiarities of our predecessors. As she had\n'charred' for them, she was able to satisfy our curiosity to a\nconsiderable extent, and then great was the pleasure of retailing to\nour mother, as she sat knitting in the twilight, the anecdotes we had\ncollected of 'the little Russians.'\n\n\"'The Little Russians' certainly did much to cement our attachment to\nReka Dom. Their history was the history of our home. It was the\nromance of the walks we played in, the swing we sat in, the gardens we\ntended every day. To play at being the little Russians superseded all\nother games. To 'pretend' that the little Russians were with us, and\nto give dolls' entertainments in their honour, supplanted all former\nfancies. Their gardens, by-the-by, were not allotted to their\nsuccessors without some difficulty, and the final decision involved a\ndisappointment to me. It seemed as if there could not be two opinions\nas to the propriety of my having the letter M. But on further\nconsideration it appeared that as the remaining letters did not fit\nthe names of my brothers and sisters, some other way of distributing\nthem must be found. My mother at last decided that the letters of the\nsix beds were to be written on six separate bits of paper, and put in\na bag, and that one was to be drawn by each in turn. I still hoped\nthat I might draw the letter M, but it was not to be. That large and\nsunny bed fell to my youngest brother, and I drew the letter I. Now\nnot only was the bed little more than a fourth of the size of that\nwhich I had looked on as my own, but being very much in the shade, it\nwas not favourable to flowers. Then the four divisions of the letter M\nafforded some scope for those effective arrangements which haunt one's\nspring dreams for the coming summer; but what could be done with a\nnarrow strip with two narrower ends where the box-edging almost met,\nand where nothing would blossom but lilies of the valley?\n\n(\"Capricious things those lilies are! So obdurate under coaxing when\ntransplanted to some place they do not like, so immovably flourishing\nin a home that suits them!)\n\n\"What I did was to make the best of my fate. After trying to reduce\nthe lilies of the valley to one neat group, and to cultivate gayer\nflowers in the rest of the bed, and after signally failing in both\nattempts, I begged a bit of spare ground in the big garden for my\nroses and carnations, and gave up my share of the Russian plat to the\nluxuriant lilies.\n\n\"It had belonged to the eldest boy. One of those born in Russia, and\nwith the outlandish names of which the charwoman spoke. His name was\nIvan. Many a time did I wish it had been William or Matthew, and once,\nI remember, I dreamt a tantalizing dream of discovering that it was\nOliver, and of digging up the middle of the O, and effecting a round\nbed of unrivalled brilliancy, with a white rose for the centre-piece\nand crown. Once in the year, however, I had my revenge. In spring my\nlilies of the valley were the finest to be seen. We had a custom that\nall through the flower season a bouquet was laid by my mother's plate\nbefore she came down to breakfast, and very proud we were when they\ncame from our own gardens. There were no horticultural wonders in\nthese nosegays, but in my short season of triumph, the size and\nfragrance of my flowers never failed to excite admiration; and many\ngrown-up people besides my mother were grateful for bouquets from my\nnarrow bed. Credit in the matter I deserved none, for Ivan's lilies\ntook care of themselves.\n\n\"Having learnt the names of the little Russians, we had no difficulty\nin discovering to which of them the respective letter beds had\nbelonged; and one of our amusements was that each should endeavour to\ncarry out what (so far as we could learn) had been the habits and\ncustoms of the little Russian to whose garden he had succeeded. Then\nwe had a whole class of partisan games which gave us wonderful\nentertainment. Sometimes we pretended to be Scottish chieftains, or\nfeudal barons of England, or chiefs of savage tribes. Our gardens\nwere always the lands we had inherited or conquered, and we called\nourselves by the names of the little Russians. When we were Highland\nchiefs, I remember, we put Mac indiscriminately before all the names;\nin some cases with a comical, and in others with a very satisfactory\neffect. As chief of the MacIvans I felt justly proud of my title, but\na brother who represented the MacElizabeths was less fortunate. In the\nsham battles our pet animals (we each had one) did duty for retainers,\nmuch to their bewilderment. The dogs, indeed, would caper about, and\nbark round the opposing parties in a way that was at least\ninspiriting; but my Sandy Tom brandished his tail and took flying\nleaps upon no principle whatever; and as to Fatima's tortoise, it\nnever budged from the beginning of the conflict to the end. Once,\nindeed, by strewing dandelion heads in the direction of the enemy's\nground she induced him to advance, and at the cry of 'Forward,\nMacPeters!' he put forth a lazy leg, and with elephantine dignity led\nthe attack, on the way to his favourite food. But (in spite of the\nfable) his slow pace was against him, and in the ensuing _mêlée_ he\nwas left far behind.\n\n\"I could not learn much about Ivan, but of what I did discover some\nthings were easy enough for me to follow. He was fond of boating, a\ntaste I was not allowed to cultivate; but also he was fond of books,\nthe old woman said, and fond of sitting in the swing and reading, and\nI heartily approved his choice in this respect.\n\n\"In helping to unpack my father's library, I had discovered a copy of\nWalton and Cotton's 'Angler,' similar in every respect, but its good\ncondition, to the one that had charmed me at the inn. Sometimes the\nprecious volume was lent to me, and with it in my lap, and my arms\nround the ropes of the swing, I passed many a happy hour. What fancies\nI wove after studying those quaint, suggestive old prints! As sweet as\nthat 'contexture of woodbines, sweet-briar, and myrtle' in which the\nanglers sat and sipped orange punch at Tottenham. The characters of\n_Piscater_, _Venater_, and _Auceps_, and the style of their\nconversations by the wayside, I found by no means unlike those of the\nPilgrim's Progress. The life-like descriptions of nature (none the\nless attractive at my age from being quaintly mixed with fable and\nsymbolism, and pointed with pious morals) went straight to my heart;\nand though I skipped many of the fish chapters, I re-read many of the\nothers, and 'The Complete Angler' did not a little to feed my strong\nnatural love for out-door life and country pleasures, to confirm my\nhabit of early rising, and to strengthen my attachment to the\nneighbourhood of a river.\n\n\"But my father's library furnished another volume for my garden\nstudies. From him I inherited some of that taste which finds a magic\nattraction in dictionaries and grammars; and I only wish that I had\nproperly mastered about half the languages in which it was the delight\nof my girlhood to dabble. As yet, however, I only looked at the\n'grammar corner' with ambitious eyes, till one day there came upon me\nthe desire to learn Russian. I asked my father for a Russian grammar,\nand he pointed out the only one that he possessed. My father seldom\nrefused to lend us his books, and made no inquiries as to why we\nwanted them; but he was intensely strict about their proper treatment,\nso that we early learnt to turn over leaves from the top, to avoid\ndogs' ears, and generally to treat books properly and put them away\npunctually. Thus I got the grammar, and carried it off to the swing.\nAlas! it was not even Russian and English. It was a fat old French\nedition, interleaved for notes. The notes were my father's, and in\nEnglish, which was of some assistance, and I set myself resolutely to\nlearn the alphabet. But my progress was slow, and at last I got my\nfather to write _Reka Dom_ for me in Russian character, as I had\ndetermined to master these few letters first and then proceed. I soon\nbecame familiar with them, and was not a little proud of the\nachievement. I made a large copy to fasten upon the nursery wall; I\nwrote it in all my books; and Fatima, who could not be induced to\nattack the fat grammar with me, became equally absorbed on her part in\nthe effort to reduce the inscription to cross-stitch for the benefit\nof her sampler.\n\n\"I borrowed the fat grammar again, and, in spite of my father's\nwarnings that it was too difficult for me as yet, I hoped soon to be\nproficient in the language of the little Russians. But warnings from\none's elders are apt to come true, and after a few vain efforts I left\nthe tough old volume in its corner and took to easier pastimes.\n\n\"I had always an inventive turn, and was, as a rule, the\ndirector-in-chief of our amusements. I know I was often very tiresome\nand tyrannical in the ensuing arrangements, and can only hope the\ntrouble I took on these occasions on behalf of my brothers and\nsisters, served in their eyes to balance my defects. I remember one\ndevice of mine that proved particularly troublesome.\n\n\"When sham battles had ended in real quarrels, and following in the\nfootsteps of the little Russians was becoming irksome--(especially to\nFatima, whose predecessor--Peter--had been of a military turn, and had\nbegun fortifications near the kitchen garden which she was incompetent\nto carry out) a new idea struck me. I announced that letters properly\nwritten and addressed to the little Russians, 'Reka Dom, Russia,' and\nposted in the old rhubarb-pot by the tool-house, would be duly\nanswered. The replies to be found in a week's time at the same office.\n\n\"The announcement was received with delight, and no doubt was ever\nexpressed as to the genuineness of the answers which I regularly\nsupplied, written, by the by, in excellent English, but with Reka Dom\nneatly effected in Russian characters on the note-paper. In the first\nplace, I allowed no awkward inquiries into the machinery of my little\nplots for the benefit of the rest; and in the second, we had all, I\nthink, a sort of half-and-half belief, a wilful credulity in reference\nto our many fancies (such as fairies and the like), of which it is\nimpossible to give the exact measure. But when, the six weekly letters\nhaving become rather burdensome, I left off writing answers from Ivan\nto myself, the others began to inquire why Ivan never wrote now. As\nusual, I refused to give any explanations, and after inventing several\nfor themselves which answered for awhile, they adopted by general\nconsent an idea put forth by little Phillis. The child was sitting one\nday with her fat cheek on her hand, and her eyes on the rhubarb-pot,\nwaiting for her share of the correspondence to be read aloud to her,\nwhen the fancy seemed to strike her, and she said quietly, but with an\nair of full conviction--\n\n\"'_I___ know what it is--_Ivan is dead_.'\n\n\"The idea took strange hold of us all. We said, 'Perhaps he is dead,'\nand spoke and thought of him as dead, till I think we were fully\npersuaded of it. No chair was set for him at the dolls' feasts, and I\ngained a sort of melancholy distinction as being without a partner\nnow. 'You know Mary has no little Russian, since Ivan is dead.'\n\n\"When our visible pets died, we buried them with much pomp, to the\nsound of a drum and a tin trumpet, in a piece of ground by the\ncabbage-bed; but in the present instance that ceremony was impossible.\nWe resolved, however, to erect a gravestone to the memory of our fancy\nfriend in his own garden. I had seen letters cut on stone, and was\nconfident that with a chisel and hammer nothing could be easier. These\nthe nursery tool-box furnished. I wrote out an elaborate inscription\nheaded by Reka Dom in Russian characters, and we got a stone and set\nto work. The task, however, was harder than we had supposed. My long\ncomposition was discarded, and we resolved to be content with this\nsimple sentence, _To the memory of Ivan_. But 'brevity is the soul of\nwit,' and the TO took so long to cut, that we threw out three more\nwords, and the epitaph finally stood thus:\n\n\"TO IVAN.\n\n\"In a rude fashion this was accomplished; and with crape on our arms\nand the accustomed music we set up the stone among the lilies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In time, Ida, we grew up, as it is called. Almost before we knew it,\nand whilst we still seemed to be looking forward to our emancipation\nfrom nursery authority and childish frocks, Fatima and I found\nourselves grown-up young ladies, free to fashion our costume to our\nown tastes, and far from Reka Dom. Yes, we had changed our home again.\nThe River House was ours no longer. Childhood also had slipped from\nour grasp, but slowly as the years had seemed to pass, they had not\nsufficed to accomplish every project we had made in them. Not one of\nthose long summers by the river had seen that gorgeous display of\nflowers in our garden which in all good faith and energy we planned\nwith every spring. I had not learnt Russian. Years had gone by since I\nfirst took up the fat grammar, but I had acquired little since that\ntime beyond the familiar characters of the well-beloved name, Reka\nDom.\n\n\"The country town that circumstances had now made our home possessed\nat least one attraction for us. It was here that our old friends the\nMisses Brooke had settled when their brother's death broke up the\nquiet little household. I was very fond of the good ladies; not less\nso now than I had been as a child, when their home-made buns and faded\nalbums made an evening festive, and were looked forward to as a treat.\nThey were good women, severe to themselves and charitable to others,\nwho cultivated the grace of humility almost in excess. One little\nweakness, however, in their otherwise estimable characters had at\ntimes disturbed the even course of our friendship. I hardly know what\nto call it. It was not want of candour. More truthful women do not\nexist than they were, and I believe they never wilfully deceived\nanyone. I can only describe it as a habit of indulging in small plots\nand suspicions; a want of trust in other people, partly traceable,\nperhaps, to a lack of due confidence in themselves, but which was very\nprovoking to one as young, eager, and sincerely affectionate as I was.\nI was indignant to discover little plots laid to test my sincerity;\nand to find my genuine (if not minutely measured) expressions of\nfeeling doubted. If this peculiarity had been troublesome in the early\nstages of our acquaintance, it was doubly so when we met again, after\nthe lapse of some years. For one thing, the dear ladies were older,\nand fidgety, foolish little weaknesses of this kind sometimes increase\nwith years. Then I was older also, and if they had doubted their own\npowers of entertainment when I was a child, they would still less\nbelieve that I could enjoy their society now that I was a 'young\nlady.' Whereas the truth was, that though my taste for buns and my\nreverence for smooth pencil drawings in impossible perspective had\ncertainly diminished, my real enjoyment of a quiet evening with my old\nfriends was greater than before. I liked to take my sewing to their\nundisturbed fireside, and not a few pieces of work which had flagged\nunder constant interruptions at home were rapidly finished as I\nchatted with them. I liked to draw out the acquirements which they\nwould not believe that they possessed. I enjoyed rubbing my modern and\ndesultory reading against their old-fashioned but solid knowledge. I\nadmired their high and delicate principles, and respected their almost\nfatiguing modesty. At an age when religious questions move and often\nseriously trouble girls' minds, I drew comfort from their piety, which\n(although as quiet and modest as all their other virtues) had been for\nyears, under my eyes, the ruling principle of all they did, the only\nsubject on which they had the courage to speak with decision, the\ncrown of their affections and pleasures, and the sufficient\nconsolation of their sorrow. In addition to all this, when I went to\nthem, I knew that my visit gave pleasure.\n\n\"It seemed hard that they could not always repose a similar confidence\nin me. And yet so it was. The consistent affection of years had failed\nto convince them that 'a young, pretty, lively girl' (as they were\npleased to call me) could find pleasure in the society of 'two dull\nold women.' So they were apt to suspect either a second motive for my\nvisit, or affectation in my appearance of enjoyment. At times I was\nchafed almost beyond my powers of endurance by these fancies; and on\none occasion my vexation broke all bounds of respect.\n\n\"'You think me uncandid, ma'am,' I cried; 'and what are you? If you\nwere to hear that I had spoken of you, elsewhere, as two dull old\nwomen, you would be as much astonished as angered. You know you would.\nYou know you don't think I think so. I can't imagine why you say it!'\n\n\"And my feelings being as much in the way of my logic as those of most\nother women, I got no further, but broke down into tears.\n\n\"'She says we're uncandid, Mary' sobbed Miss Martha.\n\n\"'So we are, I believe,' said Miss Mary, and then we all cried\ntogether.\n\n\"I think the protracted worry of this misunderstanding (which had been\na long one) had made me almost hysterical. I clearly remember the\nfeeling of lying with my face against the horsehair sofa in the little\ndining-room, feebly repeating, 'You shouldn't, you know. You\nshouldn't!' amid my tears, my hair being softly stroked the while by\nthe two sisters, who comforted me, and blamed themselves with a depth\nof self-abasement that almost made me laugh. It had hardly seemed\npossible that their customary humility could go lower. The affair was\nwound up with a good deal of kissing, and tea, and there were no more\nsuspicions for a long time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There had been peace, as I said, for long. But as, at the best of\ntimes, the Misses Brooke never gave us an invitation without going\nthrough the form of apologizing for the probable dulness of the\nentertainment, I was not surprised one morning to find myself invited\nto tea at Belle Vue Cottage for the following evening, on the strict\ncondition that I should refuse the invitation if I felt disinclined to\ngo. I had met the good ladies as we came out of church. There was\nMorning Prayer on Wednesdays and Fridays at one church in the town,\nand if the two little straw bonnets of the Misses Brooke had not been\nseen bending side by side at every service, the rest of the scanty\ncongregation would have been as much astonished as if every one in the\ntown who had time and opportunity for public worship had availed\nthemselves of the privilege. On this day they had been there as usual,\nand when we turned up the street together, the invitation was given.\n\n\"'And could you induce your respected father to come with you, Mary\ndear?' added Miss Mary. 'You know our rooms are small, or we should be\nso glad to see Fatima. But we have a few friends coming, and she will\nunderstand.'\n\n\"'Only a few,' Miss Martha said, hastily. 'Don't make her think\nthere's anything worth coming for, Mary. And mind, Mary dear, if you\ndon't care to come, that you say so. There's no need for “excuses”\nwith us. And you know exactly what our tea-parties are.'\n\n\"'Now, Miss Martha,' I said, shaking my fist at her, 'I won't bear\nit!'\n\n\"'Well, my dear, you know it's true. And if you should have an\ninvitation to the Lodge between now and to-morrow night, mind you\nthrow us over. There's no dancing and heavy supper at the Cottage.'\n\n\"'I'll eat a pound of beefsteak and have a private hornpipe to fortify\nme before I come, ma'am. And if the Lightfoots should ask me between\nnow and then, I'll think about throwing over my oldest friends to\noblige you!'\n\n\"'You're very clever, my dear,' sighed Miss Martha, 'and it's easy to\nlaugh at a stupid old woman like me.'\n\n\"Now this was rather unfair, for I had only taken to banter on these\noccasions because a serious treatment of the subject had failed. I\nmade my peace, however, by grave and affectionate assurances that I\nwished to come, and would like to come; and by adding a solemn promise\nthat if I felt averse from it when the time came, I would stay at\nhome.\n\n\"I was vexed to find symptoms of the old misunderstanding arising. The\ngood ladies were evidently in a fidgety humour to-day, and going home\nfull of it, I poured out my vexation to Fatima.\n\n\"Fatima's composure was not so easily ruffled as mine. She was apt to\nsit in easy, graceful attitudes, looking very idle, but getting\nthrough a wonderful amount of exquisite needlework, and listening to\nmy passing grievances without being much disturbed herself.\n\n\"'I don't think I would worry myself,' she said, as she rapidly sorted\nthe greens for a leaf in her embroidery. 'My idea is, that you will\nfind the party more lively than usual. I have often noticed that when\nthe old ladies are particularly full of apologies, something or\nsomebody is expected.'\n\n\"'I didn't want anything or anybody,' I said, dolefully; 'but I wish\nthey wouldn't take fancies, and I wish they wouldn't put one through\nsuch cross-examinations about nothing. As to the party, who could\nthere be, but the old set?'\n\n\"'Nobody, I suppose. There'll be the Wilkinsons, of course;' and\nFatima marked the fact with an emphatic stitch. 'And Mr. Ward, I\nsuppose, and Dr. Brown, and the Jones's girls, and--'\n\n\"'Oh, the rooms wouldn't hold more!' I said.\n\n\"'There's always room for one more--for a gentleman at any rate; and,\ndepend upon it, it is as I say.'\n\n\"Fatima was not so fond of the Misses Brooke as I was. She did not\nscruple to complain of the trouble it cost to maintain intimate\nrelations with the excellent but touchy old ladies, and of the hot\nwater about trifles into which one must perpetually fall.\n\n\"'I hope I am pretty trustworthy,' she would say, 'and I am sure you\nare, Mary. And if we are not, let them drop our acquaintance. But they\ntreat their friends as we used to treat our flowers at Reka Dom! They\nare always taking them up to see how they are going on, and I like to\nvegetate in peace.'\n\n\"I could not have criticized my dear and respected old friends so\nfreely; but yet I knew that Fatima only spoke the truth.\n\n\"The subject was unexpectedly renewed at dinner.\n\n\"'Mary,' said my father, 'is there any mystery connected with this\ntea-party at Miss Brooke's?'\n\n\"Fatima gave me a mischievous glance.\n\n\"'If there is, sir,' said I, 'I am not in the secret.'\n\n\"'I met them in the town,' he went on, 'and they were good enough to\ninvite me; and as I must see Ward about some registers, I ventured to\nask if he were to be of the party (thinking to save my old legs a walk\nto his place). The matter was simple enough, but Miss Martha seemed to\nfancy that I wanted to know who was going to be there. I fully\nexplained my real object, but either she did not hear or she did not\nbelieve me, I suppose, for she gave me a list of the expected\ncompany.'\n\n\"'I am sure she would have believed you, sir, if she had realized what\nyou were saying,' I said. 'I know the sort of thing, but I think that\nthey are generally so absorbed in their own efforts to do what they\nthink you want, they have no spare attention for what you say.'\n\n\"'A very ingenious bit of special pleading, my dear, but you have not\nheard all. I had made my best bow and was just turning away, when\nMiss Martha, begging me to excuse her, asked with a good deal of\nmystery and agitation if _you_ had commissioned me to find out who was\nto be at the party. I said I had not seen you since breakfast, but\nthat I was quite able to assure her that if you had wished to find out\nanything on the subject, you would have gone direct to herself, with\nwhich I repeated my best bow in my best style, and escaped.'\n\n\"I was too much hurt to speak, and Fatima took up the conversation\nwith my father.\n\n\"'You will go, sir?' she said.\n\n\"'Of course, my dear, if Mary wishes it. Besides, Ward _is_ to be\nthere. I learnt so much.'\n\n\"'You learnt more, sir,' said Fatima, 'and please don't leave us to\ndie of curiosity. Who is to be there, after all?'\n\n\"'The Wilkinsons, and Miss Jones and her sister, and Ward, and an old\nfriend of Miss Brooke's, a merchant.'\n\n\"'But his name, please!' cried Fatima, for my father was retreating to\nhis study.\n\n\"'Smith--John Smith,' he answered laughing, and we were left alone.\n\n\"I was very much disposed to be injured and gloomy, but Fatima would\nnot allow it. She was a very successful comforter. In the first place,\nshe was thoroughly sympathetic; and in the second, she had a great\ndislike to any disturbance of the general peace and harmony, and at\nlast, her own easy, cheerful view of things became infectious where no\nvery serious troubles were concerned.\n\n\"'People must have their little weaknesses,' she said, 'and I am sure\nthey haven't many failings.'\n\n\"'This weakness is so unworthy of them,' I complained.\n\n\"'All good people's weaknesses are unworthy of them, my dear. And the\nbetter they are, the more unworthy the weakness appears. Now, Mary, do\nbe reasonable! You know at the bottom how true they are, and how fond\nof you. Pray allow them a few fidgety fancies, poor old dears. No\ndoubt we shall be just as fidgety when we are as old. I'm sure I shall\nhave as many fancies as hairs in my wig, and as to you, considering\nhow little things weigh on your mind now--'\n\n\"Fatima's reasoning was not conclusive, but I think I came at last to\nbelieve that Miss Brooke's distrust was creditable to herself, and\ncomplimentary to me--so it certainly must have been convincing.\n\n\"'And now,' she concluded, 'come upstairs and forget it. For I have\ngot two new ideas on which I want your opinion. The first is a new\nstitch, in which I purpose to work some muslin dresses for us both. I\nthought of it in bed this morning. The second is a new plan for\nbraiding your hair, which came into my head whilst father was reading\naloud that speech to us last night. I had just fastened up the last\nplait when he laid down the paper.'\n\n\"'You absurd Fatima!' I cried. 'How could you! And it was so\ninteresting!'\n\n\"'Don't look shocked,' said Fatima. 'I shall never be a politician. Of\nall studies, that of politics seems to me the most disturbing and\nuncomfortable. If some angel, or inspired person would tell me which\nside was in the right, and whom to believe in, I could be a capital\npartisan. As it is, I don't worry myself with it; and last night when\nyou were looking flushed and excited at the end of the speech, I was\ncalmly happy--'\n\n\"'But, Fatima,' I broke in, 'you don't mean to say--'\n\n\"'If it had lasted five minutes longer,' said Fatima, 'I should have\ncomfortably decided whether ferns or ivy would combine better with the\nloops.'\n\n\"'But, Fatima! were you really not listening when--'\n\n\"'On the whole I decide for ivy,' said Fatima, and danced out of the\nroom, I following and attempting one more remonstrance in the hall.\n\n\"'But, Fatima!--'\n\n\"'With perhaps a suspicion of white chrysanthemums,' she added over\nthe banisters.\n\n\"Both the new ideas promised to be successful, and the following\nevening my hair was dressed in what Fatima now called the political\nplaits. From the first evening of my introduction into society she had\nestablished herself as my lady's maid. She took a generous delight in\ndressing me up, and was as clever as she was kind about it. This\nevening she seemed to have surpassed herself, as I judged by the\nadmiring exclamations of our younger sister Phillis--a good little\nmaid, who stood behind my chair with combs and pins in her hand as\nFatima's aide-de-camp. Finally, the dexterous fingers interwove some\nsprays of ivy with the hair, and added white rosebuds for lack of\nchrysanthemums.\n\n\"'Perfect!' Fatima exclaimed, stepping backwards with gestures of\nadmiration that were provokingly visible in the glass before which I\nsat. 'And to think that it should be wasted on an uninteresting\ntea-party! You will not wear your new muslin, of course?'\n\n\"'Indeed, I shall,' I answered. 'You know I always make myself smart\nfor the Cottage.' Which was true, and my reason for it was this. I\nhad once gone there to a quiet tea-party in a dress that was rather\ntoo smart for the occasion, and which looked doubly gay by contrast\nwith the sombre costume of the elderly friends whom I met. I was\nfeeling vexed with myself for an error in taste, when Miss Mary came\nup to me, and laying her hands affectionately on me, and smoothing my\nribbons, thanked me for having come in such a pretty costume.\n\n\"'You come in, my dear,' she said, 'like a fresh nosegay after winter.\nYou see we are old women, my love, and dress mostly in black, since\ndear James's death; and our friends are chiefly elderly and\nsombre-looking also. So it is a great treat to us to look at something\nyoung and pretty, and remember when we were girls, and took pains with\nsuch things ourselves.'\n\n\"'I was afraid I was too smart, Miss Mary,' I said.\n\n\"'To be sure it is a waste to wear your pretty things here,' Miss Mary\nadded; 'but you might let us know sometimes when you are going to a\ngrand party, and we will come and look at you.'\n\n\"I was touched by the humble little lady's speech, and by the thought\nof how little one is apt to realize the fact that faded, fretful,\ntrouble-worn people in middle life have been young, and remember their\nyouth.\n\n\"Thenceforward I made careful toilettes for the Cottage, and this\nnight was not an exception to the rule.\n\n\"I was dressed early; my father was rather late, and we three girls\nhad nearly an hour's chat before I had to go.\n\n\"We began to discuss the merchant who was to vary the monotony of our\nsmall social circle. Phillis had heard that a strange gentleman had\narrived in the town this afternoon by the London stage. Fatima had an\nidea on the subject which she boldly stated. One of the Misses Brooke\nwas going to be married--to this London merchant. We were just at an\nage when a real life romance is very attractive, and the town was not\nrich in romances--at least, in our little society. So Fatima's idea\nfound great favour with us, and, as she described it, seemed really\nprobable. Here was an old friend, a friend of their youth, and\nprobably a lover, turned up again, and the sisters were in a natural\nstate of agitation. (It fully accounted for Miss Martha's suspicious\nsensitiveness yesterday, and I felt ashamed of having being\naggrieved.) Doubtless the lovers had not been allowed to marry in\nearly life because he was poor. They had been parted, but had remained\nfaithful. He had made a fortune, like Dick Whittington, and now, a\nrich London merchant, had come back to take his old love home. Being\nan old friend, it was obviously a youthful attachment; and being a\nmerchant, he must be very rich. This happy combination--universal in\nfiction, though not invariable in real life--was all that could be\ndesired, and received strong confirmation from the fact of his coming\nfrom London; for in those days country girls seldom visited the\nmetropolis, and we regarded the great city with awe, as the centre of\nall that was wealthy and wonderful. It was a charming story, and\nthough we could not but wish that he had returned before Miss Martha\ntook to a 'front' and spectacles, yet we pictured a comfortable\ndomestic future for them; and Fatima was positive that 'worlds' might\nbe done for the appearance of the future Mrs. Smith by more tasteful\ncostume, and longed ardently to assume the direction of her toilette.\n\n\"'I don't believe that she need wear a front,' she pleaded. 'I daresay\nshe has plenty of pretty grey hair underneath. Spectacles are\nintellectual, if properly worn; which, by the by, they need not be at\nmeals when your husband is looking at you across the table; and as to\ncaps--'\n\n\"But here my father knocked at the door, and I put on my cloak and\nhood, and went with him.\n\n\"The Misses Brooke received us affectionately, but I thought with some\nexcitement, and a flush on Miss Martha's cheeks almost made me smile.\nI could not keep Fatima's fancy out of my head. Indeed, I was\npicturing my old friend in more cheerful and matronly costume\npresiding over the elegant belongings of a stout, well-to-do,\ncomfortable Mr. John Smith, as I moved about in the little room, and\nexchanged mechanical smiles and greetings with the familiar guests. I\nhad settled the sober couple by their fireside, and was hesitating\nbetween dove-colour and lavender-grey for the wedding silk, when Miss\nMartha herself disturbed me before I had decided the important\nquestion. I fancied a slight tremor in her voice as she said--\n\n\"'Mr. John Smith.'\n\n\"I dropped a more formal curtsey than I had hitherto done, as was due\nto a stranger and a gentleman, and looked once at the object of my\nbenevolent fancies, and then down again at my mittens. His head was\njust coming up from a low bow, and my instantaneous impression was,\n'He wears a brown wig.' But in a moment more he was upright, and I saw\nthat he did not. And--he certainly was not suitable in point of age. I\ntook one more glance to make sure, and meeting his eyes, turned\nhastily, and plunged into conversation with my nearest neighbour, not\nnoticing at the instant who it was. As I recovered from my momentary\nconfusion, I became aware that I was talking to the rector's wife, and\nhad advanced some opinions on the subject of the weather which she was\nenergetically disputing. I yielded gracefully, and went back to my\nthoughts. I hope Miss Martha did not feel as I did the loss of that\nsuitable, comfortable, middle-aged partner my fancy had provided for\nher. It did seem a pity that he had no existence. I thought that\nprobably marriage was the happiest condition for most people, and felt\ninclined to discuss the question with the rector's wife, who had had\nabout twenty-two years' exemplary experience of that state. Then I\nshould like to have helped to choose the silk--\n\n\"At this point I was asked to play.\n\n\"I played some favourite things of Miss Brooke's and some of my own,\nMr. Smith turning over the leaves of my music; and then he was asked\nto sing, and to my astonishment, prepared to accompany himself. Few\nEnglish gentlemen (if any) could accompany their own songs on the\npianoforte in my youth, Ida; most of them then had a wise idea that\nthe pianoforte was an instrument 'only fit for women,' and would have\nas soon thought of trying to learn to play upon it as of studying the\nspinning-wheel. I do not know that I had ever heard one play except my\nfather, who had lived much abroad. When Mr. Smith sat down at the\ninstrument, I withdrew into a corner, where Miss Martha followed me as\nif to talk. But when he began, I think every one was silent.\n\n\"The song he sang is an old one now, Ida, but it was comparatively new\nthen, and it so happened that very few of us had heard it before. It\nwas 'Home, Sweet Home.' He had a charming voice, with a sweet pathetic\nring about it, and his singing would have redeemed a song of far\nsmaller merit, and of sentiment less common to all his hearers. As it\nwas, our sympathies were taken by storm. The rector's wife sobbed\naudibly, but, I believe, happily, with an oblique reference to the ten\nchildren she had left at home; and poor Miss Martha, behind me,\ntouched away tear after tear with her thin finger-tips, and finally\ntook to her pocket-handkerchief, and thoughts of the dear dead\nbrother, and the little house and garden, and I know not what earlier\nhome still. As for me, I thought of Reka Dom.\n\n\"We had had many homes, but that was _the_ home _par excellence_--the\nbeloved of my father, the beloved of us all. And as the clear voice\nsang the refrain, which sounded in some of our ears like a tender cry\nof recall to past happiness,\n\n     \"'Home--Home--sweet, sweet Home!'\n\n\"I stroked Miss Martha's knee in silent sympathy, and saw Reka Dom\nbefore my eyes. The river seemed to flow with the melody. I swung to\nthe tune between the elm-trees, with Walton and Cotton on my lap. What\nwould Piscator have thought of it, had the milkmaid sung him this\nsong? I roamed through the three lawns that were better to me than\npleasures and palaces, and stood among the box-edged gardens. Then the\nrefrain called me back again--\n\n     \"'Home--Home--sweet, sweet Home!'\n\n\"I was almost glad that it ended before I, too, quite broke down.\n\n\"Everybody crowded round the singer with admiration of the song, and\ninquiries about it.\n\n\"'I heard it at a concert in town the other day,' he said, 'and it\nstruck me as pretty, so I got a copy. It is from an English opera\ncalled “Clari,” and seems the only pretty thing in it.'\n\n\"'Do you not like it?' Miss Jones asked me; I suppose because I had\nnot spoken.\n\n\"'I think it is lovely,' I said, 'as far as I can judge; but it\ncarries one away from criticism; I do not think I was thinking of the\nmusic; I was thinking of Home.'\n\n\"'Exactly.'\n\n\"It was not Miss Jones who said 'Exactly,' but the merchant, who was\nstanding by her; and he said it, not in that indefinite tone of polite\nassent with which people commonly smile answers to each other's\nremarks at evening parties, but as if he understood the words from\nhaving thought the thought. We three fell into conversation about the\nsong--about 'Clari'--about the opera--the theatre--about London; and\nthen Dr. Brown, who had been educated in the great city, joined us,\nand finally he and Miss Jones took the London subject to themselves,\nand the merchant continued to talk to me. He was very pleasant\ncompany, chiefly from being so alive with intelligence that it was\nmuch less trouble to talk with him than with any one I had ever met,\nexcept my father. He required so much less than the average amount of\nexplanation. It hardly seemed possible to use too few words for him to\nseize your meaning by both ends, so to speak; the root your idea\nsprang from, and conclusion to which it tended.\n\n\"We talked of music--of singing--of the new song, and of the subject\nof it--home. And so of home-love, and patriotism, and the characters\nof nations in which the feeling seemed to predominate.\n\n\"'Like everything else, it depends partly on circumstances, I\nsuppose,' he said. 'I sometimes envy people who have only one\nhome--the eldest son of a landed proprietor, for instance. I fancy I\nhave as much home-love in me as most people, but it has been divided;\nI have had more homes than one.'\n\n\"'_I_ have had more homes than one,' I said; 'but with me I do not\nthink it has been divided. At least, one of the homes has been so much\ndearer than the others.'\n\n\"'Do you not think so because it is the latest, and your feelings\nabout it are freshest?' he asked.\n\n\"I laughed. 'A bad guess. It is not my present home. This one was near\na river.'\n\n\"'Exactly.'\n\n\"This time the 'exactly' did not seem so appropriate as before, and I\nexplained further.\n\n\"'For one thing we were there when I was at an age when attachment to\na place gets most deeply rooted, I think. As a mere child one enjoys\nand suffers like a kitten from hour to hour. But when one is just old\nenough to form associations and weave dreams, and yet is still a\nchild--it is then, I fancy, that a home gets almost bound up with\none's life.'\n\n\"He simply said 'Yes,' and I went on. Why, I can hardly tell, except\nthat to talk on any subject beyond mere current chit-chit, and be\nunderstood, was a luxury we did not often taste at the tea-parties of\nthe town.\n\n\"'And yet I don't know if my theory will hold good, even in our case,'\nI went on, 'for my father was quite as much devoted to the place as we\nwere, and fell in love with it quite as early. But the foreign name\nwas the first attraction to him, I think.'\n\n\"'It was abroad, then?' he asked.\n\n\"I explained, and again I can hardly tell why, but I went on talking\ntill I had given him nearly as full a history of Reka Dom as I have\ngiven to you. For one thing he seemed amazingly interested in the\nrecital, and drew out many particulars by questions; and then the song\nhad filled my head with tender memories, and happy little details of\nold times, and it was always pleasant to prose about the River Home,\nas indeed, my child, it is pleasant still.\n\n\"We were laughing over some childish reminiscence, when Miss Martha\ntapped me on the shoulder and said rather louder than usual--\n\n\"'Dear Mary, there are some engravings here, my love, I should like\nyou to look at.'\n\n\"I felt rather astonished, for I knew every book and picture in the\nhouse as well as I knew my own, but I followed her to a table, when\nshe added, in a fluttering whisper--\n\n\"'You'll excuse my interrupting you, my love, I'm sure; but it was\nbecoming quite particular.'\n\n\"I blushed redder than the crimson silk binding of the 'Keepsake'\nbefore me. I wished I could honestly have misunderstood Miss Martha's\nmeaning. But I could not. Had I indeed talked too much and too long to\na gentleman and a stranger? (It startled me to reflect how rapidly we\nhad passed that stage of civil commonplace which was the normal\ncondition of my intercourse with the gentlemen of the town.) I was\ncertainly innocent of any intentional transgression of those bounds of\nreticence and decorum which are a young lady's best friends, but as to\nthe length of my conversation with the merchant I felt quite uncertain\nand unspeakably alarmed.\n\n\"I was indulging a few hasty and dismal reflections when Miss Martha\ncontinued--\n\n\"'When I was young, dear Mary, I remember a valuable piece of advice\nthat was given me by my excellent friend and schoolmistress, Miss\nPeckham, “If you are only slightly acquainted with a gentleman, talk\nof indifferent matters. If you wish to be friendly but not\nconspicuous, talk of _his_ affairs; but only if you mean to be very\nintimate, speak of yourself;”' and adding, 'I'm sure you'll forgive\nme, my love,' Miss Martha fluttered from the table.\n\n\"At the moment I was feeling provoked both with her and with myself,\nand did not feel so sure about the forgiveness as she professed to be;\nbut of one thing I felt perfectly certain. Nothing but sheer necessity\nshould induce me to speak another syllable to the London merchant.\n\n\"Circumstances did not altogether favour my resolution. I scrupulously\navoided so much as a look at Mr. Smith, though in some mysterious way\nI became conscious that he and my father were having a long\n_tête-à-tête_ conversation in a corner. I devoted myself exclusively\nto the rector's wife till supper, and then I carefully chose the\nopposite side of the table to that to which the merchant seemed to be\ngoing. But when I was fairly seated, for some reason he gave up his\nplace to someone else, and when it was impossible for me to change my\nseat, he took the one next to it. It was provoking, but I steadily\nresisted his attempts to talk, and kept my face as much averted as\npossible. Once or twice he helped me to something on the table, but I\nbarely thanked him, and never lifted my eyes to his face. I could\nnot, however, avoid seeing the hand that helped me, and idly noticing\na ring that I had remarked before, when he was playing. It was a fine\nblue stone, a lapis lazuli, curiously and artistically set. 'Rich\nmerchants can afford such baubles!' I thought. It was very tasteful,\nhowever, and did not look like English work. There was something\nengraven upon it, which did not look like English either. Was it\nGreek? I glanced at it with some curiosity, for it reminded me of--but\nthat was nonsense, a fancy that came because the subject was in my\nmind. At this moment the hand and ring were moved close to me and I\nlooked again.\n\n\"It was not a fancy. There was no mistaking the inscription this time.\nI had learnt it too thoroughly--written it too often--loved it too\nwell--it was _Reka Dom_.\n\n\"For a moment I sat in blind astonishment. Then the truth suddenly\nflashed upon me. The merchant's name was the name of our predecessors\nat Reka Dom. True, it was such a common one that I had met more than\none family of Smiths since then without dreaming of any connection\nbetween them and the River House. And yet, of course, it was there\nthat the Misses Brooke had known him. Before our time. Which could he\nbe? He was too young to be the father, and there was no John among the\nlittle Russians--unless, yes, it was the English version of one of the\nRussian names--and this was Ivan.\n\n\"It crowned my misfortunes. What would Miss Martha say if she knew\nwhat had been the subject of our conversation? Would that that\nexcellent rule which had been the guide of her young ladyhood had\ncurtailed the conversational propensities of mine! I thought of the\nthree degrees of intimacy with a shudder. Why had we not been\nsatisfied with discussing the merits of the song?\n\n\"We had gone on to talk of him and his homes, and as if that were not\nenough, had proceeded further to me and mine. I got red as I sat\nlistening to some civil chat from Mr. Ward the curate (eminently in\nthe most innocent stage of the first degree), and trying to recall\nwhat we had not spoken of in connection with that Home which had been\nso beloved of both of us, and that Ivan whose lilies I had tended for\nyears.\n\n\"I grew nearly frantic as I thought that he must think that I had\nknown who he was, and wildly indignant with the fancy for small\nmysteries which had kept Miss Brooke from telling us whom we were\ngoing to meet.\n\n\"At last the evening came to an end. I was cloaking myself in the hall\nwhen the merchant came up and offered his help, which I declined. But\nhe did not go, and stood so that I could not help seeing a distressed\nlook in his eyes, and the nervous way in which he was turning the blue\nring upon his finger.\n\n\"'I have so wanted to speak to you again,' he said. 'I wanted to\nsay--'\n\n\"But at this moment I caught Miss Martha's eye in the parlour doorway,\nand, dropping a hasty curtsey, I ran to my father.\n\n\"'A very nice young fellow,' my father observed, as I took his arm\noutside; 'a superior, sensible, well informed gentleman, such as you\ndon't meet with every day.'\n\n\"I felt quite unequal to answering the remark, and he went on:\n\n\"'What funny little ways your old friends have, my dear, to be sure.\nConsidering how few strangers come to the place, it would have been\nnatural for them to tell us all about the one they asked us to meet;\nand as they had known both him and us, as tenants of Reka Dom, it was\ndoubly natural that they should speak of him to us, and of us to him.\nBut he told me that we were just the people present of whom he had not\nheard a word. He seems both fond of them and to appreciate their\nlittle oddities. He told me he remembers, as a boy, that they never\nwould call him Ivan, which is as much his name as any by which a man\nwas ever baptized. They thought it might give him a tendency to\naffectation to bear so singular a name in England. They always called\nhim John, and keep up the discipline still. When he arrived yesterday\nthey expressed themselves highly satisfied with the general\nimprovement in him, and he said he could hardly help laughing as Miss\nMartha added, 'And you seem to have quite shaken off that little habit\nof affectation which--you'll excuse me, dear John--you had as a boy.'\nHe says that, to the best of his belief, his only approach to\naffectation consisted in his being rather absent and ungainly, and in\na strong aversion from Mr. Brooke.'\n\n\"'Did the old gentleman wear that frightful shade in his time?' I\nasked.\n\n\"'Not always,' he says, 'but he looked worse without it. He told me a\ngood deal about him that I had never heard. He remembered hearing it\nspoken of as a boy. It appears that the brother was very wild and\nextravagant in his youth; drank, too, I fancy, and gave his poor\nsisters a world of trouble, after breaking the heart of the widowed\nmother who had spoiled him. When she died the sisters lived together,\nand never faltered in their efforts to save him--never shut their\ndoors against him when he would return--and paid his debts over and\nover again. He spent all his own fortune, and most of theirs, besides\nbeing the means of breaking off comfortable marriages for both. Mr.\nSmith thinks that a long illness checked his career, and eventually he\nreformed.'\n\n\"'I hope he was grateful to his poor sisters,' I said.\n\n\"'One naturally thinks that he must have been so, but Smith's remark\nwas very just. He said, “I fancy he was both penitent and grateful as\nfar as he was able, but I believe he had been too long accustomed to\ntheir unqualified self-sacrifice to feel it very sensitively!” And I\nbelieve he is right. Such men not seldom reform in conduct if they\nlive long enough, but few eyes that have been blinded by years of\nselfishness are opened to see clearly in this world.'\n\n\"'It ought to make one very tender with the good ladies' little\nweaknesses,' I said, self-reproachfully; and I walked home in a more\npeaceful state of mind. I forgave poor Miss Martha; also I was\nsecretly satisfied that my father had found the merchant's\nconversation attractive. It seemed to give me some excuse for my\nbreach of Miss Peckham's golden rule. Moreover, little troubles and\noffences which seemed mountains at Bellevue Cottage were apt to\ndwindle into very surmountable molehills with my larger-minded\nparents. I was comparatively at ease again. My father had evidently\nseen nothing unusual in my conduct, so I hoped that it had not been\nconspicuous. Possibly I might never meet Mr. Smith any more. I rather\nhoped not. Life is long, and the world wide, and it is sometimes\npossible to lose sight of people with whom one has disagreeable\nassociations. And then it was a wholesome lesson for the future.\n\n\"'And what was the old gentleman like?' was Fatima's first question,\nwhen I came upstairs. I had just been talking of Mr. Brooke, and no\nother old gentleman occurred to my memory at that moment.\n\n\"'What old gentleman?' I asked dreamily.\n\n\"'Miss Martha's old gentleman, the merchant--wasn't he there, after\nall?'\n\n\"I blushed at my stupidity, and at a certain feeling of guiltiness in\nconnection with the person alluded to.\n\n\"'Oh, yes, he was there,' I answered; 'but he is not an old\ngentleman.'\n\n\"'What is he, then?' Fatima asked, curiously.\n\n\"It is undoubtedly a luxury to be the bearer of a piece of startling\nintelligence, and it is well not to spoil the enjoyment of it by over\nhaste. I finished unsnapping my necklace, and said, very\ndeliberately--\n\n\"'He is one of the little Russians.'\n\n\"Fatima's wit jumped more quickly than mine had done. It was she who\nadded--\n\n\"'Then he is Ivan.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My hopes in reference to Mr. Smith were disappointed. I had not seen\nthe last of him. My mother was at this time from home, and I was\nhousekeeper in her absence. It was on the morning following the\nBellevue tea-party that my father said to me--\n\n\"'Mr. Smith is coming up to refer to a book of mine to-day, my dear;\nand I asked him to stay to dinner. I suppose it will be convenient?'\n\n\"I said, 'Certainly, sir.'\n\n\"I could plead no domestic inconvenience; but I thought that Mr.\nSmith might have gone quietly back to London by the early coach, and\nspared me the agitation which the prospect of seeing him again\nundoubtedly excited. He came, however. It was the first visit, but by\nno means the last; and he lingered in the town, greatly to my father's\nsatisfaction (who had taken a strong fancy for him), but not,\napparently, to that of the Misses Brooke.\n\n\"As I afterwards found the clue to the somewhat strange conduct of our\nold friends at this time, I may as well briefly state how it was.\n\n\"When the merchant first announced to them his proposed business visit\nto the town, and his intention of calling on them, the good ladies (in\ntheir affection for me, and having a high opinion of him) planned a\nkindly little romance of which he and I were to be the hero and\nheroine, and which was to end in our happy marriage. With this view\nthey arranged for our meeting at the tea-party, and avoided all\nmention of each to the other, that we might meet in the (so to speak)\nincidental way characteristic of real love stories. With that\nsuspiciousness of people in general, and of young people in\nparticular, which haunted Miss Martha, she attributed my ready\nacceptance of the invitation to my having heard of Mr. Smith's\narrival, and to the unusual attraction of an eligible gentleman at the\ntea-party. Little did she guess the benevolent plans which on my part\nI had formed for her, and which the merchant's youthful appearance had\ndashed to the ground.\n\n\"It is sometimes the case, my dear Ida, that people who make these\nkind plans for their friends, become dissatisfied with the success of\ntheir arrangements if they themselves cease to be the good genii of\nthe plot. If, that is, matters seem likely to fall out as they wish,\nbut without their assistance. It was so with the Misses Brooke, and\nespecially with Miss Martha. Fully aware of the end which she in her\nown mind proposed to our acquaintance, my long conversation with the\nmerchant struck her as an indelicate readiness to accept attentions\nwhich had matrimony in her perspective, and which she had designed to\nbe the gradual result of sundry well-chaperoned and studiously\nincidental interviews at the Cottage. And when, so far from thankfully\naccepting these incidental meetings, the merchant took upon himself to\nbecome an almost daily visitor at our house, and delayed his return to\nLondon far beyond the time proposed for his departure, the good lady's\nview underwent a decided change. It was 'a pity' that a young man like\nJohn Smith should neglect his business. It was also 'a pity' that dear\nMary's mother was not at home. And when I took occasion casually to\nallude to the fact that Mr. Smith's visits were paid to my father, and\n(with the exception of an occasional meal) were passed in the study\namongst German pamphlets, my statement was met by kind, incredulous\nsmiles, and supplemented with general and somewhat irritating\nobservations on the proper line of conduct for young ladies at certain\ncrises of life. Nothing could be kinder than Miss Martha's intentions,\nand her advice might have been a still greater kindness if she would\nhave spoken straight-forwardly, and believed what I said. As it was, I\nleft off going to Bellevue Cottage, and ardently wished that the\nmerchant would go back to his merchandise, and leave our quiet little\ntown to its own dull peace.\n\n\"Sometimes I thought of the full-grown man whose intelligent face, and\nthe faintly foreign accent of whose voice were now familiar in our\nhome--the busy merchant, the polite and agreeable gentleman. And then\nI thought of the Ivan I seemed to have known so much better so long\nago! The pale boy wandering by the water--reading in the swing--dead\nby that other river--buried beneath the lilies. Oh! why had he lived\nto come back in this new form to trouble me?\n\n\"One day he came to my father as usual, and I took the opportunity to\ncall on my old friends. I felt ashamed of having neglected them, and\nas I knew that Mr. Smith was at our house, I could not be suspected of\nhaving hoped to meet him at theirs. But I called at an unfortunate\nmoment. Miss Martha had just made up her mind that in the absence of\nmy mother, and the absentness of my father, it was the duty of old\nfriends like herself to give me a little friendly counsel. As she took\na great deal of credit for being 'quite candid, my dear,' and quietly,\nbut persistently refused to give me credit for the same virtue, I was\ntoo much irritated to appreciate the kindness which led her to\nundertake the task of interference in so delicate a matter; and found\nher remarks far from palatable. In the midst of them the merchant was\nannounced.\n\n\"If I could have looked innocent it would have done me no good. As it\nwas, I believe I looked very guilty. After sitting for a few minutes\nlonger I got up to go, when to my horror the merchant rose also. The\nold ladies made no effort to detain him, but Miss Martha's face spoke\nvolumes as we left the house. Half mad with vexation, I could hardly\nhelp asking him why he was stupid enough to come away just at the\nmoment I had chosen for leaving; but he forestalled the inquiry by a\nvoluntary explanation. He wished to speak to me. He had something to\nsay.\n\n\"When he had said it, and had asked me to marry him, my cup was full.\nI refused him with a vehemence which must have surprised him, modest\nas he was, and rushed wildly home.\n\n\"For the next few days I led a life of anything but comfort. First as\nto Ivan. My impetuous refusal did not satisfy him, and he wrote me a\nletter over which I shed bitter tears of indescribable feeling.\n\n\"Then as to my father. The whole affair took him by surprise. He was\nastonished, and very much put out, especially as my mother was away.\nSo far from its having been, as with the Misses Brooke, the first\nthing to occur to him, he repeatedly and emphatically declared that it\nwas the very last thing he should have expected. He could neither\nimagine what had made the merchant think of proposing to me, nor what\nhad made me so ready to refuse him. Then they were in the very middle\nof a crabbed pamphlet, in which Ivan's superior knowledge of German\nhad been invaluable. It was most inconvenient.\n\n\"'Why didn't I like poor Ivan?'\n\n\"Ah, my child, did I not like him!\n\n\"'Then why was I so cross to him?'\n\n\"Indeed, Ida, I think the old ladies' 'ways' were chiefly to blame for\nthis. Their well-meant but disastrous ways of making you feel that you\nwere doing wrong, or in the wrong, over matters the most\nstraight-forward and natural. But I was safe under the wing of my\nmother, before I saw Ivan again; and--many as were the years he and I\nwere permitted to spend together--I think I may truthfully say that I\nwas never cross to him any more.\n\n\"'What did he say in that letter that made me cry?'\n\n\"He asked to be allowed to make himself better known to me, before I\nsent him quite away. And this developed an ingenious notion in my\nfather's brain, that no better opportunity could, from every point of\nview, be found for this, than that I should be allowed to sit with\nthem in the study whilst he and Ivan went on with the German pamphlet.\n\n\"The next call I paid at Bellevue Cottage was to announce my\nengagement, and I had some doubt of the reception my news might meet\nwith. But I had no kinder or more loving congratulations than those of\nthe two sisters. Small allusion was made to bygones. But when Miss\nMartha murmured in my ear--\n\n\"'You'll forgive my little fussiness and over-anxiety, dear Mary. One\nwould be glad to guard one's young friends from some of the\ndifficulties and disappointments one has known oneself--' I thought of\nthe past life of the sisters, and returned her kiss with tenderness.\nDoubtless she had feared that the merchant might be trifling with my\nfeelings, and that a thousand other ills might happen when the little\nlove affair was no longer under her careful management. But all ending\nwell, was well; and not even the Bellevue cats were more petted by the\nold ladies than we two were in our brief and sunny betrothal.\n\n\"Sunny, although for the most part it was winter time. When we would\nsit by the fireside in the privileged idleness of lovers, sometimes at\nhome, sometimes in the Cottage parlour; and Ivan would tell of the\nRussian Reka Dom, and of all the winter beauties and pleasures of that\nother river which was for months a frozen highway, with gay sleighs\nflying, jingling over the snow roads, and peasants wrapped in\nsheepskin crossing from the country to market in the town. How dogs\nand children rolled together in snow so dry from intense cold that it\nhardly wet them more than sand. And how the river closed, and when it\nopened, with all the local traditions connected with these events; and\nof the stratagems resorted to to keep Jack Frost out of the houses,\nand of the stores laid up against the siege of the Winter King.\n\n\"But through the most interesting of his narratives Fatima's hands\nwere never idle. She seemed to have concentrated all her love for me\ninto those beautiful taper fingers, which laboured ceaselessly in\nexquisite needlework on my wedding clothes.\n\n\"And when the lilies of the valley were next in blossom, Ivan and I\nwere married.\n\n\"The blue-stoned ring was cut down to fit my finger, and was, by my\ndesire, my betrothal ring, and I gave Ivan another instead of it.\nInside his was engraven the inscription we had cut upon his tombstone\nat Reka Dom,--\n\n\"'TO IVAN.'\"\n\nIt was a long story, and Nurse had been waiting some little time in\nthe old lady's kitchen when it came to an end.\n\n\"And is Ivan--?\" Ida hesitatingly began.\n\n\"Dead. Many years since, my child,\" said the little old lady; \"you\nneed not be afraid to speak of him, my dear. All that is past. We used\nto hope that we should neither of us long outlive the other, but God\nwilled it otherwise. It was very bitter at first, but it is different\nnow. The days and hours that once seemed to widen our separation are\nnow fast bringing us together again.\"\n\n\"Was he about papa's age when he died?\" Ida gently asked.\n\n\"He was older than your father can have been, my love, I think. He was\na more than middle-aged man. He died of fever. It was in London, but\nin his delirium he fancied that the river was running by the windows,\nand when I bathed his head he believed that the cooling drops were\nfrom the waters of his old home.'\n\n\"Didn't he know you?\" Ida asked, with sudden sympathy.\n\n\"He knew the touch of my hands always, my dear. It was my greatest\ncomfort. That, and the short time of perfect reason before he sank to\nrest. We had been married thirty years, and I had worn my silver\nwedding-ring with even more pride than the golden one. There have been\nlilies on the grave of the true Ivan for half that time, and will be,\nperhaps, for yet a little while, till I also am laid beneath them.\n\n\"So ends the story, my dear,\" the little old lady added, after a\npause.\n\n\"I should like to know what became of the old landlord, please,\" Ida\nsaid.\n\n\"If you will ask an old woman like me the further history of the\npeople she knew in her youth,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, smiling, \"you\nmust expect to hear of deaths. Of course he is dead many a long year\nsince. We became very intimate with him whilst we were his tenants,\nand, I believe, cheered the close of his life. He and my father were\nfast friends, but it was to my mother that he became especially\ndevoted. He said she was an exception to her sex, which from his point\nof view was a high compliment. He had unbounded confidence in her\njudgment, and under her influence, eventually modified many of his\npeculiar habits. She persuaded him to allot a very moderate sum to\nhousekeeping expenses, and to indulge in the economical luxury of a\ntrustworthy servant. He consented to take into use a good suit of\nclothes which he possessed, and in these the old man was wont at last\nto accompany us to church, and to eat his Sunday dinner with us\nafterwards. I do not think he was an illiberal man at heart, but he\nhad been very poor in his youth--('So poor, ma'am,' he said one day\nto my mother, 'that I could not live with honour and decency in the\nestate of a gentleman. I did not live. I starved--and bought\nbooks,')--and he seemed unable to shake off the pinching necessity of\nyears. A wealthy uncle who had refused to help him whilst he lived,\nbequeathed all his money to him when he died. But when late in life\nthe nephew became rich, habits of parsimony were a second nature, and\nseemed to have grown chronic and exaggerated under the novel anxieties\nof wealth. He still 'starved--and bought books.' During the last years\nof his life he consulted my mother (and, I fancy, other people also)\non the merits of various public charities in the place and elsewhere;\nso that we were not astonished after his death to learn from his will\nthat he had divided a large part of his fortune amongst charitable\ninstitutions. With the exception of a few trifling legacies to\nfriends, the rest of his money was divided in equal and moderate\nbequests to relatives. He left some valuable books to my father, and\nthe bulk of his library to the city where he was born.\"\n\n\"Was your mother with him when he died?\" Ida asked.\n\n\"She was, my dear. But, sadly enough, only at the very last. We were\nat the seaside when he was seized by his last illness, and no one told\nus, for indeed it is probable that few people knew. At last a letter\nfrom the servant announced that he was dying, and had been most\nanxious to see my mother, and she hastened home. The servant seemed\nrelieved by her arrival, for the old gentleman was not altogether an\neasy patient to nurse. He laughed at the doctor, she said, and\nwouldn't touch a drop of his medicine, but otherwise was as patient as\na sick gentleman could be, and sat reading his Bible all the day long.\nIt was on the bed when my mother found him, but his eyes were dimming\nfast. He held out his hands to my mother, and as she bent over him\nsaid something of which she could only catch three words--'the true\nriches.' He never spoke again.\"\n\n\"Poor man?\" said Ida: \"I think he was very nice. What became of his\ncat?\"\n\n\"Dead--dead--dead!\" said the little old lady; \"Ida, my child, I will\nanswer no more questions.\"\n\n\"One more, please,\" said Ida! \"where is that dear, dear Fatima?\"\n\n\"No, my child, no! Nothing more about her. Dear, dear Fatima, indeed!\nAnd yet I will just tell you that she married, and that her husband\n(older even than I am, and very deaf) is living still. He and I are\nvery fond of each other, though, having been a handsome man he is\nsensitive about his personal appearance, and will not use a trumpet,\nwhich I consider weak. But we get on very well. He smells my flowers,\nand smiles and nods to me, and says something in a voice so low that I\ncan't hear it; and I stick a posy in his buttonhole, and smile and nod\nto him, and say something in a voice so loud that _he_ can't hear it;\nand so we go on. One day in each year we always spend together, and go\nto church. The first of November.\"\n\n\"That is--?\" said Ida.\n\n\"The Feast of All Saints, my child.\"\n\n\"Won't you tell me any more?\" Ida asked.\n\n\"No, my dear. Not now, at any rate. Remember I am old, and have\noutlived almost all of those I loved in my youth. It is right and\nnatural that death should be sad in your eyes, my child, and I will\nnot make a tragedy of the story of Reka Dom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Then your real name,\" said Ida, as she gave the old lady a farewell\nkiss, \"is--\"\n\n\"Mary Smith, my dear,\" said Mrs. Overtheway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning the little old lady went to church as usual, and Ida was\nat the window when she returned. When the child had seen her old\nfriend into the house she still kept her place, for the postman was\ncoming down the street, and it was amusing to watch him from door to\ndoor, and to see how large a bundle of letters he delivered at each.\nAt Mrs. Overtheway's he delivered one, a big one, and an odd curiosity\nabout this letter took possession of Ida. She wished she knew what it\nwas about, and from whom it came, though, on the face of it, it was\nnot likely she would be much the wiser if she did. She was still at\nthe window when the door of the opposite house was opened, and the\nlittle old lady came hurriedly out. She had only her cap upon her\nhead, and she held an open letter in her hand; _the_ letter, it was\nevident. When she reached the little green gate she seemed to\nrecollect herself, and, putting her hand to her head, went back into\nthe house. Ida waited anxiously to see if she would come out again,\nand presently she appeared, this time in her bonnet, but still with\nthe letter in her hand. She crossed the street, and seemed to be\ncoming to the house. Then the bell rang, and in she came. Ida's\ncuriosity became intense, and was not lessened by the fact that the\nlittle old lady did not come to her, but stayed below talking with\nsome one. The old gentleman had not returned, so it must be Nurse.\n\nAt last the conversation came to an end, and Mrs. Overtheway came\nupstairs.\n\nShe kissed Ida very tenderly, and inquired after her health; but\nthough she seemed more affectionate than usual, Ida felt persuaded\nthat something was the matter. She drew a chair to the fire, and the\nold lady sat down, saying--\n\n\"May I stay a little with you, my dear?\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you?\" said Ida, and put a footstool for the old lady's\nfeet.\n\nMrs. Overtheway stroked her head tenderly for some time in silence,\nand then said, in a gentle voice--\n\n\"I have something to tell you, my dear.\"\n\n\"Another story?\" Ida asked. \"Oh, thank you, if it is another story.\"\n\nThe old lady was silent, but at last she said, as if to herself--\n\n\"Perhaps best so,\" and added: \"yes, my love, I will tell you a story.\"\n\nIda thanked her warmly, and another pause ensued.\n\n\"I hardly know where to begin, or what to tell you of this story,\"\nsaid the little old lady at last, seeming to falter for the first time\nin her Scharazad-like powers of narration.\n\n\"Let it be about a Home, please; if you can,\" said Ida.\n\n\"A home!\" said the old lady, and strangely enough, she seemed more\nagitated than when she had spoken of Reka Dom--\"It should have begun\nwith a broken home, but it shall not. It should end with a united\nhome, God willing. A home! I must begin with a far-away one, a strange\none, on the summit of high cliffs, the home of fearless, powerful\ncreatures, white-winged like angels.\"\n\n\"It's a fairy tale,\" said Ida.\n\n\"No, my child, it is true.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a fairy tale,\" Ida said.\n\n\"It shall be a tale of that description, if you like,\" said the old\nlady, after a pause, \"but, as I said, the main incidents are true.\"\n\n\"And the white-winged creatures?\" Ida asked. \"Were they fairies?\"\n\n\"No, my love; birds. But if to see snowy albatrosses with their huge\nwhite wings wheeling in circles about a vessel sailing in mid ocean be\nanything like what I have read of and heard described, fairyland could\nhardly show anything more beautiful and impressive.\"\n\n\"Do they fly near ships, then?\" Ida asked.\n\n\"Yes, my child. I remember my husband describing them to me as he had\nonce seen them in southern seas. He said that when he saw them,\ngreat, white, and majestic, holding no intercourse with anyone on\nboard the ship, and yet spreading their wings above her day and night\nfor hundreds of miles over the ocean, with folded feet, the huge white\npinions, except for an occasional flap, outstretched in steady sail,\nnever resting, and seemingly never weary, they looked like guardian\nangels keeping watch over the crew.\"\n\n\"I wonder if they are sorry for the ships that go down?\" said Ida,\nthoughtfully.\n\nMrs. Overtheway took her hand.\n\n\"Do you think it unkind in me to talk of ships, my love?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" Ida exclaimed, \"I don't mind _your_ talking about it. I\nwish I could talk to the birds that saw papa's ship go down, if there\nwere any, and ask them how it was, and if he minded it much, and if he\nremembered me. I used to wish I had been with him, and one night I\ndreamed about it; but when the water touched me, I was frightened, and\nscreamed, and woke; and then I was glad I hadn't been there, for\nperhaps he wouldn't have loved me so much if he had seen that I wasn't\nbrave.\"\n\nThe little old lady kissed her tenderly.\n\n\"And now the story, please,\" said Ida, after a pause.\n\nAnd Mrs. Overtheway began the following story:\n\n\n\n\nKERGUELEN'S LAND.\n\n    \"'Down in the deep, with freight and crew,\n      Past any help she lies,\n    And never a bale has come to shore\n      Of all thy merchandise.\n\n    'For cloth o' gold and comely frieze,'\n       Winstanley said, and sigh'd,\n    'For velvet coif, or costly coat,\n       They fathoms deep may bide.\n\n    'O thou, brave skipper, blithe and kind,\n       O mariners bold and true,\n    Sorry at heart, right sorry am I,\n       A-thinking of yours and you.'\"\n\n\"WINSTANLEY\" (JEAN INGELOW).\n\n\n\"Father Albatross had been out all day, and was come home to the\nisland which gives its name to this story. He had only taken a short\nflight, for his wife was hatching an egg, and he kept comparatively\nnear the island where her nest was situated. There was only one egg,\nbut parental affection is not influenced by numbers. There is always\nlove enough for the largest family, and everything that could be\ndesired in an only child, and Mother Albatross was as proud as if she\nhad been a hen sitting on a dozen.\n\n\"The Father Albatross was very considerate. Not only did he deny\nhimself those long flights which he and his mate had before so greatly\nenjoyed, but he generally contrived to bring back from his shorter\ntrips some bits of news for her amusement. Their island home lay far\nout of the common track of ships, but sometimes he sighted a distant\nvessel, and he generally found something to tell of birds or fish,\nwhales or waterspouts, icebergs or storms. When there was no news he\ndiscussed the winds and waves, as we talk of the weather and the\ncrops.\n\n\"Bits of news, like misfortunes, are apt to come together. The very\nday on which the egg hatched, Father Albatross returned from his\nmorning flight so full of what he had seen, that he hardly paid any\nattention to his mate's announcement of the addition to his family.\n\n\"'Could you leave the nest for a quarter of an hour, my dear?' he\nasked.\n\n\"'Certainly not,' said Mother Albatross; 'as I have told you, the egg\nis hatched at last.'\n\n\"'These things always happen at the least convenient moments,' said\nthe father bird. 'There's a ship within a mere wing-stretch, untold\nmiles out of her course, and going down. I came away just as she was\nsinking, that you might have a chance of seeing her. It is a horrible\nsight.'\n\n\"'It must be terrible to witness', she replied, 'and I would give\nworlds to see it; but a mother's first duty is the nest, and it is\nquite impossible for me to move. At the same time I beg that you will\nreturn, and see whatever there is to be seen.'\n\n\"'It is not worth while,' he answered; 'there was not a moment to\nlose, and by this time she must be at the bottom with all belonging to\nher.'\n\n\"'Could none of them fly away?' the Mother Albatross asked.\n\n\"'No men have wings,' replied her mate, 'nor, for that matter, fins\nor scales either. They are very curious creatures. The fancy they have\nfor wandering about between sea and sky, when Nature has not enabled\nthem to support themselves in either, is truly wonderful. Go where you\nwill over the ocean and you meet men, as you meet fish and birds. Then\nif anything disables these ships that they contrive to go about in,\ndown they go, and as the men can neither float nor fly, they sink to\nthe bottom like so many stones.'\n\n\"'Were there many on the ship you saw?' the mother bird asked.\n\n\"'More than one likes to see drowned in a batch,' said Father\nAlbatross 'and I feel most sorry for the captain. He was a fine\nfellow, with bright eyes and dark curly plumage, and would have been a\nhandsome creature if he had had wings. He was going about giving\norders with desperate and vain composure, and wherever he went there\nwent with him a large dog with dark bright curls like his own. I have\nseen the ship before, and I know the dog. His name is Carlo. He is the\ncaptain's property, and the ship's pet. Usually he is very quiet, and\nsometimes, when it blows, he is ill; but commonly he was on deck,\nblinking with the most self-sufficient air you can imagine. However,\nto-day, from the moment that danger was imminent, he seemed to be\naware of it, and to have only one idea on the subject, to keep close\nto his master. He got in front of him as he moved about, sat down at\nhis feet when he stood still, jumped on him when he shouted his\norders, and licked his hands when he seized the ropes. In fact, he\nwas most troublesome. But what can you expect of a creature that\nrequires four legs to go about with, and can't rise above the earth\neven with these, and doesn't move as many yards in a day as I go miles\nin an hour? He _can_ swim, but only for a certain length of time.\nHowever, he is probably quiet enough now; and perhaps some lucky\nchance has rolled him to his master's feet below the sea.'\n\n\"'Have men no contrivance for escaping on these occasions?' the mother\nbird inquired.\n\n\"'They have boats, into which they go when the ship will hold them no\nlonger. It is much as if you should put out the little one to fly in a\nstorm against which your own wings failed.'\n\n\"'Perhaps the boats are in good order when the ship is not,' said\nMother Albatross, who had a practical gift. 'Were there boats to this\none?'\n\n\"'There were. I saw one lowered, and quickly filled with men, eager to\nsnatch this last chance of life.\n\n\"'Was the captain in it?' she asked.\n\n\"'No. He stayed on the ship and gave orders. The dog stayed with him.\nAnother boat was lowered and filled just as the ship went down.'\n\n\"'Was the captain in it?'\n\n\"'Again, no. He stayed with the vessel and some others with him. They\nwere just sinking as I came for you. With the last glance I gave I saw\nthe captain standing quite still near the wheel. The dog was sitting\non his feet. They were both looking in one direction--away over the\nsea. But why should you distress yourself? It is all over long since.\nThink of the little one, and let us be thankful that we belong to a\nsuperior race. We might have been born without wings, like poor\nsailors.'\n\n\"'I cannot help grieving for the captain,' said Mother Albatross.\n'When you spoke of his bright eyes and handsome plumage I thought of\nyou; and how should I feel if you were to die? I wish he had gone in\nthe boats.'\n\n\"'I doubt if he would have fared better,' said the father bird. 'The\nsecond boat must have been swamped in the sinking of the ship; and it\nis far from probable that the other will get to land.'\n\n\"'Nevertheless, I hope you will fly in that direction to-morrow,' she\nsaid, 'and bring me word whether there are any traces of the\ncatastrophe.'\n\n\"The following morning Father Albatross set off as he was desired. The\nship had foundered quite near to the other side of the island, and\nincluding a little excursion to see if the first boat were still above\nwater, he expected to be back very shortly.\n\n\"He returned even sooner than the Mother Albatross had hoped, and\ndescended to the side of their nest with as much agitation as his\nmajestic form was capable of displaying.\n\n\"'Wonders will never cease!' he exclaimed. 'What do you think are on\nthe island?'\n\n\"'I couldn't guess if I were to try from now till next hatching\nseason,' said his mate; 'and I beg you will not keep me in suspense. I\nam not equal to the slightest trial of the nerves. It is quite enough\nto be a mother.'\n\n\"'The captain and one or two more men are here,' said the albatross.\n'What do you think of that? You will be able to see him for yourself,\nand show the youngster what men are like into the bargain. It's very\nstrange how they have escaped; and that lazy, self-sufficient dog is\nwith them.'\n\n\"'I cannot possibly leave our young one at present,' said the Mother\nAlbatross, 'and he certainly cannot get so far. It will be very\nprovoking if the men leave the island before I can see them.'\n\n\"'There is not much to fear of that,' her mate answered. 'A lucky wave\nhas brought them to shore, but it will take a good many lucky waves to\nbring a ship to carry them home.'\n\n\"Father Albatross was right; but his mate saw the strangers sooner\nthan she expected. Her nest, though built on the ground, was on the\nhighest point of the island, and to this the shipwrecked men soon made\ntheir way; and there the Mother Albatross had ample chance of seeing\nthe bright eyes of the captain as they scanned the horizon line with\nkeen anxiety. Presently they fell upon the bird herself.\n\n\"'What splendid creatures they are!' he said to his companion; 'and so\ngrandly fearless. I was never on one of these islands where they breed\nbefore. What a pity it is that they cannot understand one! That fellow\nthere, who is just stretching his noble wings, might take a message\nand bring us help.'\n\n\"'He is a fine creature,' said the Mother Albatross, peeping at the\ncaptain from her nest; 'that is, he would be if he had wings, and\ncould speak properly, instead of making that unmusical jabbering like\na monkey.'\n\n\"'I would give a good deal to one of them for a report of the first\nboat,' the captain went on. 'Heaven knows I would be content to die\nhere if I could know that it was safe. But I'm afraid--I'm afraid; oh!\ndear!'\n\n\"And the captain paced up and down, the other consoling him.\n\n\"'He doesn't seem as tame as one might expect,' said the Mother\nAlbatross, 'he's so restless. But possibly he is hungry.'\n\n\"Truly it was a great amusement for the mother bird to watch the\nstrangers from her nest, and to question her mate on their\npeculiarities.\n\n\"'What is he doing now?' she asked on one occasion, when the captain\nwas reading a paper which he had taken from the note-book in his\npocket.\n\n\"'That is a letter,' said the Father Albatross. 'And from the look of\nit I gather that, like ourselves, he has got a young one somewhere,\nwherever his nest may be.'\n\n\"'How do you gather that?' his mate inquired.\n\n\"'Because the writing is so large,' answered the Father Albatross. 'It\nis one of the peculiarities of these creatures that the smaller they\nare the larger they write. That letter is from a young one; probably\nhis own.'\n\n\"'Very remarkable indeed,' said the Mother Albatross. 'And what is he\ndoing _now_?'\n\n\"'Now he is writing himself,' said her mate; 'and if you observe you\nwill see my statement confirmed. See how much smaller he writes!'\n\n\"The captain had indeed torn a sheet from his note-book, and was busy\nscribbling upon his knees. Whether the sight of papers was a familiar\nmemory with Carlo, or whether he was merely moved by one of those\ndoggish impulses we so little understand, it is impossible to say; but\nwhen the captain began to write, Carlo began to wag his tail, and he\nwagged it without pause or weariness till the captain had finished,\nkeeping his nearest eye half open, and fixed upon the paper and the\ncaptain's moving hand. Once he sat up on his haunches and put his nose\non the letter.\n\n\"'That is right, old fellow, kiss it,' said the captain. 'I am just\ntelling her about you. Heaven send she may ever read it, poor child!'\n\n\"At this Carlo became so frantic, and so persistent in pushing his\nnose on to the paper, that the captain was fain to pocket his writing\nmaterials, and have a game at play with the 'ship's dog,' in which the\nlatter condescendingly joined for a few minutes, and then lay down as\nbefore, shutting his eyes with an air which seemed to imply--\n\n\"'I see, poor fellow, you don't understand me.'\n\n\"The hardships endured by this small remnant of the ship's company\nwere not very great. They managed to live. The weather was fine, and\nthey did not at first trouble themselves about any permanent shelter.\nPerhaps, too, in spite of their seaman's knowledge of the position\nthey were in, some dim hope of a ship out of her course as they had\nbeen, picking them off, buoyed them up with the fancy that 'it was not\nworth while.' But no ship appeared; and they built themselves a hut\nnear the albatross's nest, and began to talk of other seasons, and\nprovision for the future. They kept a look-out by turns through the\ndaylight, and by night when the moon and stars made the distance\nvisible. Every morning the sun rising above the sea met the captain's\nkeen eyes scanning the horizon, and every evening that closed a day's\nfruitless watch, the sun's going down saw the captain's brown hands\nclasped together as he said, 'God's will be done!'\n\n\"So days became weeks, and weeks ripened into months, and Carlo became\nused to his new home, and happy in it, and kept watch over his master,\nand took his ease as usual. But the men's appearance changed, and\ntheir clothes began to look shabby. In the first place they were\nwearing out, and, secondly, they seemed--as we say--to be 'getting too\nlarge' for them, and to hang loosely and untidily upon their gaunt\nframes. The captain's eyes looked larger and sadder, and his voice\ngrew hollow at sunset, and threads of white began to show among his\ndark curls, and increased in number day by day.\n\n\"'His plumage will be as white as your own very soon,' said the Mother\nAlbatross. 'I suppose it's the climate that does it.'\n\n\"'He is getting older,' said her mate; 'men, like ourselves, get white\nas they get old.'\n\n\"'But he has been here so short a time,' said Mother Albatross.\n\n\"'He is so much the older, however,' said the father bird, and his\nmate said no more; for she knew by the tone of his voice when he had\ngot to the end of his available information on any subject, and that\nbeyond this point he did not like to be pressed.\n\n\"'It's hard, it's very hard, captain, and I can't submit as you do,'\nsaid one of the men one day. He and the captain were sitting side by\nside at the look out, their elbows on their knees, and their chins\nupon their hands.\n\n\"'And yet it's harder for me than for you,' said the captain. 'One\nmust die some day. It's not that. And you are a single man, Barker,\nwithout ties.'\n\n\"The man stooped down, and taking one of Carlo's long ears in his\nhand, played absently with it, as he said--\n\n\"'No, sir. I am not married, it's true, and have no children. I feel\nfor you, sir, from my heart. But in a little house just out of\nPlymouth, that, God above knows, I can see this moment as clearly as I\nsee you, there's a girl that has either forgotten me, or is breaking\nas good a heart as ever beat in woman's breast for the man that should\nhave been her husband, and that's fast bound here upon a rock with\nsea-birds. The Lord knows best, captain, but it comes hard. We all\nhave our troubles, sir.'\n\n\"The captain laid his hand upon his shoulder.\n\n\"'Forgive me,' he said. 'God comfort you! God bless you!' And, rising\nhurriedly, he went forward, the big tears breaking over his cheeks,\nand sea and sky dancing together before his eyes.\n\n\"'What do you dream of at night, Barker?' said the captain, on\nanother day.\n\n\"'Home, sir,' said Barker.\n\n\"'Strange!' said the captain. 'So do I. In all the time we have been\nhere, I have never once dreamed of this island, or of our day's work,\nnor even of seeing a sail. I dream of England night after night.'\n\n\"'It's the same with myself, sir,' said Barker. 'I'm in Plymouth half\nmy time, I may say. And off and on I dream of my father's old home in\nSurrey.'\n\n\"'Are the men going to change their feathers, do you think?' the\nMother Albatross inquired of her mate. 'They have a most wretched\nappearance. Only the dog looks like himself.' (The first excitement of\npity and curiosity had subsided, and the good couple were now\nnaturally inclined to be critical.)\n\n\"'I detest that dog,' said Father Albatross. 'His idleness and\narrogance make me quite sick. I think I want exercise, too, and I mean\nto have a good flight to-day;' and, spreading his broad wings, the\nbird sailed away.\n\n\"His excursion did not quite dispel his irritability. When he\nreturned, he settled down by the captain, who was sitting listlessly,\nas usual, with Carlo at his feet.\n\n\"'If you would only exert yourself,' began Father Albatross,\n'something might come of it. You are getting as bad as the dog. Spread\nout those arms of yours, and see what you can do with them! If you\ncould only fly a matter of a few miles, you would see a sail--and\nthat's more than we had any reason to expect.'\n\n\"'What can be the matter with the birds to-day?' said the captain, who\nwas in rather an irritable mood himself. 'They are silent enough\ngenerally'--for the voice of the albatross is rarely heard at sea.\n\n\"'Move your arms, I tell you,' croaked the albatross. 'Up and\ndown--so!--and follow me.'\n\n\"'I shall have the dog going at them next,' muttered the captain.\n'Come along, Carlo.' And turning his back on Father Albatross, he\nmoved away.\n\n\"'He doesn't understand you,' said the Mother Albatross, who\nendeavoured, as is proper, to soothe her mate's irritability, and make\npeace. 'Couldn't you take a message to the ship yourself? It is\nnothing to your magnificent wings, and it is not his fault, poor\ncreature, that he is not formed like you.'\n\n\"'You speak very sensibly, my dear' said Father Albatross; and once\nmore he took flight over the sea.\n\n\"But he returned in even worse mood than before.\n\n\"'Nothing can equal the stupidity of human beings,' he observed. 'I\naddressed myself to the captain. \"There's an island with shipwrecked\nmen on it a few miles to the north-east,\" said I. \"We shall see land\nin about ten days, ma'am,\" says the captain to a lady on deck.\n\"There's as big a fool as yourself wrecked on an island north-east by\nnorth,\" I cried. \"If you had the skill of a sparrow you could see it\nwith your own eyes in five minutes.\" \"It's very remarkable,\" said the\ncaptain, \"I never heard one of those albatross make a sound before.\"\n\"And never will again,\" said I; \"it's a waste of time to talk to you.\nIt won't take long to put you and yours under water like the rest.\"\nAnd away I came.'\n\n\"'I don't understand the cry of human beings myself,' said his mate,\n'and I'm rather glad I do not; it would only irritate me. Perhaps he\ndid not understand you.'\n\n\"'They are all stupid alike,' said the father bird; 'but I have done\nmy best, and shall not disturb myself any more.'\n\n\"The captain watched till sunset, and folded his hands, and bent his\nhead as usual, and at last lay down to sleep. He dreamt of England,\nand of home--of a home that had been his long since, of a young wife,\ndead years ago. He dreamt that he lay, at early morning, in a sunny\nroom in a little cottage where they had lived, and where, in summer,\nthe morning sun awoke them not much later than the birds. He dreamt\nthat his wife was by him, and that she thought that he was asleep, and\nthat, so thinking, she put her arms round his neck to awaken him--that\nhe lay still, and pretended to be slumbering on, and that, so lying,\nhe saw her face bright with an unearthly beauty, and her eyes fixed\non him with such intensity of expression that they held him like a\nspell. Then he felt her warm face come nearer to his, and she kissed\nhis cheeks, and he heard her say, 'Wake up, my darling, I have\nsomething to show you.' Again she repeated vehemently, 'Awake! Awake!\nLook! Look!' and then he opened his eyes.\n\n\"He was lying at the look-out, and Carlo was licking his face. It was\na dream, and yet the voice was strong and clear in his ears, 'Awake!\nAwake! Look! Look!'\n\n\"A heavier hand than his wife's was on his shoulder, and Barker's\nrough voice (hoarser than usual), repeated the words of his dream.\n\n\"The captain's eyes followed the outstretched hand to the horizon; and\nthen his own voice grew hoarse, as he exclaimed--\n\n\"'My God! it is a sail!'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIda was not leaning on the little old lady's footstool now. She sat\nupright, her pale face whiter than its wont.\n\n\"_Did_ the ship take them away?\" she asked eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, my dear. Their signals were seen, and the ship took them home to\ntheir friends, who had believed them to be dead.\"\n\n\"Do people who have been drowned--I mean who have been thought to be\ndrowned--ever come home _really_?\" the child asked.\n\n\"Yes, really. Ida, my dear, I want you to remember that, as regards\nthe captain and the crew, this is a true story.\"\n\nIda clasped her hands passionately together.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Overtheway! Do you think Papa will ever come home?\"\n\n\"My child! my dear child!\" sobbed the little old lady. \"I think he\nwill.\" ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And he _is_ alive--he is coming home!\" Ida cried, as she recounted\nMrs. Overtheway's story to Nurse, who knew the principal fact of it\nalready. \"And she told it to me in this way not to frighten me. I did\ncry and laugh though, and was very silly; but she said I must not be\nfoolish, but brave like a captain's daughter, and that I ought to\nthank GOD for being so good to me, when the children of the\nother poor men who died will never have their fathers back in this\nworld: and I am thankful, so thankful! Only it is like a mill going in\nmy head, and I cannot help crying. And Papa wrote me a long letter\nwhen he was on the island, and he sent it to Mrs. Overtheway because\nUncle Garbett told him that I was fond of her, and that she would tell\nme nicely, and she was to read it, and to give it to me when she had\ntold me. And it is such a lovely letter, with all about the island,\nand poor Barker, and dear old Carlo, and about the beautiful birds,\ntoo, only Mrs. Overtheway made up a great deal of that herself. And\nplease, Nursey, take off my black frock and never let me see it again,\nfor the Captain is really coming home, and, oh! how I wish he would\ncome!\"\n\nThe poor child was terribly excited, but her habits of obedience stood\nher in good stead, for though she was vehemently certain that she\ncould not possibly go to sleep, in compliance with Nurse's wishes, she\nwent to bed, and there at last slept heavily and long; so that when\nshe awoke there was only just time to dress and be ready to meet her\nfather. She was putting out her treasures for him to look at, the\ncarved fans and workboxes, the beads and handkerchiefs and feathers,\nthe new letter and the old one--when the Captain came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA week after the postman had delivered the letter which contained such\nwonderful news for Ida, he brought another to Mrs. Overtheway's green\ngate, addressed in the same handwriting--the Captain's. It was not\nfrom the Captain, however, but from Ida.\n\n     \"MY DEAR, DEAR MRS. OVERTHEWAY,\n\n     \"We got here on Saturday night, and are so happy. Papa says\n     when will you come and see us? I have got a little room to\n     myself, and I have got a glass case under which I keep all\n     the things that Papa ever sent me, and his letters. I bought\n     it with part of a sovereign Uncle Garbett gave me when I\n     came away. Do you know he was so very kind when I came away.\n     He kissed me, and said, 'GOD bless you, my dear!\n     You are a good child, a very good child;' and you know it\n     was very kind of him, for I don't think I ever was good\n     somehow with him. But he was so kind it made me cry, so I\n     couldn't say anything, but I gave him a great many kisses,\n     for I did not want him to know I love Papa the best. Carlo\n     will put his nose on my knee, and I can't help making blots.\n     He came with us in the railway carriage, and ate nearly all\n     my sandwiches. When he and Papa roll on the hearthrug\n     together, I mix their curls up and pretend I can't tell\n     which is which. Only really Papa's have got some grey hairs\n     in them: _we know why_. I always kiss the white hairs when I\n     find them, and he says he thinks I shall kiss the colour\n     into them again. He is so kind! I said I didn't like Nurse\n     to wear her black dress now, and she said it was the best\n     one she had, and she must wear it in the afternoon; so Papa\n     said he would get us all some bright things, for he says\n     English people dress in mud-colour, while people who live in\n     much sunnier, brighter countries wear gay clothes. So we\n     went into a shop this morning, and I asked him to get my\n     things all blue, because it is his favourite colour. But he\n     said he should choose Nurse's things himself. So he asked\n     for a very smart dress, and the man asked what kind; and I\n     said it was for a nurse, so he brought out a lot of prints,\n     and at last Papa chose one with a yellow ground and\n     carnations on it. He wanted very much to have got another\n     one with very big flowers, but the man said it was meant for\n     curtains, not for dresses, so I persuaded him not to get it;\n     but he says now he wishes he had, as it was much the best.\n     Then he got a red shawl, and a bonnet ribbon of a kind of\n     green tartan. Nurse was very much pleased, but she said they\n     were too smart by half. But Papa told her it was because she\n     knew no better, and had never seen the parrots in the East\n     Indian Islands. Yesterday we all went to church. Carlo came\n     too, and when we got to the porch, Papa put up his hand, and\n     said, 'Prayers, sir!' and Carlo lay down and stayed there\n     till we came out. Papa says that he used to do so when he\n     was going to say prayers on board ship, and that Carlo\n     always lay quietly on deck till the service was over. Before\n     we went to church Papa gave me a little parcel sealed up, to\n     put in the plate. I asked him what it was, and he said it\n     was a thankoffering. Before one of the prayers the clergyman\n     said something. I don't quite remember the words, but it\n     began, 'A sailor desires to thank GOD--' and oh! I\n     _knew_ who it was, and I squeezed his hand very tight, and I\n     tried to pray every word of that prayer, only once I began\n     to think of the island--but I _did_ try! And indeed I do try\n     to be very, very thankful, for I am so very happy! Papa got\n     a letter from Barker this morning, and we are going out to\n     choose him a wedding present. He sent a photograph of the\n     girl he is going to marry, and I was rather disappointed,\n     for I thought she would be very lovely, only, perhaps,\n     rather sad-looking; but she doesn't look very pretty, and is\n     sitting in rather a vulgar dress, with a photograph book in\n     her hand. Her dress is tartan, and queer-looking about the\n     waist, you know, like Nurse's, and it is coloured in the\n     picture, and her brooch is gilt. Papa laughs, and says\n     Barker likes colour, as he does; and he says he thinks she\n     has a nice face, and he knows she is very good, and very\n     fond of Barker, and that Barker thinks her beautiful. He\n     didn't write before he went to see her, like Papa. He just\n     walked up to the house, and found her sitting at the window\n     with his photograph in her hand. She said she had been so\n     restless all day, she could do nothing but sit and look at\n     it. Wasn't it funny? She had been very ill with thinking he\n     was dead, and Barker says she nearly died of the joy of\n     seeing him again. Papa sends you his love, and I send lots\n     and lots of mine, and millions of kisses. And please,\n     _please_ come and see us if you can, for I miss you every\n     morning, and I do love you, and am always your grateful and\n     affectionate\n\n     \"IDA.\"\n\n     \"P.S.--I am telling Papa all your stories by bits. And do\n     you know he went to sleep whilst I was telling him Mrs.\n     Moss!\"\n\nChim! chime! chim! chime! chim! chime!\n\nThe story is ended, but the bells still call to Morning Prayer, and\nlife goes on. The little old lady comes through the green gate, and\nlooks over the way, but there is no face at that window now; something\nin it made her start for an instant, but it is only a looking-glass,\nfor the smart toilette-table has been brought back to the window where\nIda used to kneel, and the nursery is a spare bedroom once more. That\nepisode in this dull house in the quiet street is over, and gone by.\nThe old lady thinks so rather sadly as she goes where the bells are\ncalling. The pale, eager, loving little face that turned to her in its\nloneliness, now brightens a happy home; but the remembrance of it is\nwith the little old lady still, pleasant as the remembrance of flowers\nwhen winter has come. Yes, truly, not the least pleasant of Mrs.\nOvertheway's Remembrances.\n",
