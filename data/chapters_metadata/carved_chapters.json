Sometimes, when I\nlook out upon the world and see how many changes have come about, how\ndifferent many things are from what I can remember them, I could believe\nthat a still longer time had passed since my childhood than is really\nthe case. Sometimes, on the contrary, the remembrance of things that\nthen happened comes over me so very vividly, so very _real_-ly, that I\ncan scarcely believe myself to be as old as I am.\n\nI can remember things in my little girlhood more clearly than many in\nlater years. This makes me hope that the story of some part of it may\ninterest children of to-day, for I know I have not forgotten the\nfeelings I had as a child. And after all, I believe that in a great many\nways children are very like each other in their hearts and minds, even\nthough their lives may seem very different and very far apart.\n\nThe first years of my childhood were very happy, though there were some\nthings in my life which many children would not like at all. My parents\nwere not rich, and the place where we lived was not pretty or pleasant.\nIt was a rather large town in an ugly part of the country, where great\ntall chimneys giving out black smoke, and streams--once clear sparkling\nbrooks, no doubt--whose water was nearly as black as the smoke, made it\noften difficult to believe in bright blue sky or green grass, or any of\nthe sweet pure country scenes that children love, though perhaps\nchildren that have them do not love them as much as those who have not\ngot them do.\n\nI think that was the way with me. The country was almost the same as\nfairyland to me--the peeps I had of it now and then were a delight I\ncould not find words to express.\n\nBut what matters most to children is not _where_ their home is, but\n_what_ it is. And our home was a very sweet and loving one, though it\nwas only a rather small and dull house in a dull street. Our father and\nmother did everything they possibly could to make us happy, and the\ntrial of living at Great Mexington must have been far worse for them\nthan for us. For they had both been accustomed to rich homes when they\nwere young, and father had never expected that he would have to work so\nhard or in the sort of way he had to do, after he lost nearly all his\nmoney.\n\nWhen I say \"us,\" I mean my brother Haddie and I. Haddie--whose real name\nwas Haddon--was two years older than I, and we two were the whole\nfamily. My name--_was_ I was going to say, for now there are so few\npeople to call me by my Christian name that it seems hardly mine--my\nname is Geraldine. Somehow I never had a \"short\" for it, though it is a\nlong name, and Haddie was always Haddie, and \"Haddon\" scarcely needs\nshortening. I think it was because he nearly always called me Sister or\n\"Sis.\"\n\nHaddie was between ten and eleven years old and I was nine when the\ngreat change that I am going to tell you about came over our lives. But\nI must go back a little farther than that, otherwise you would not\nunderstand all about us, nor the meaning of the odd title I have chosen\nfor my story.\n\nI had no governess and I did not go to school. My mother taught me\nherself, partly, I think, to save expense, and partly because she did\nnot like the idea of sending me to even a day-school at Great Mexington.\nFor though many of the families there were very rich, and had large\nhouses and carriages and horses and beautiful gardens, they were not\nalways very refined. There were good and kind and unselfish people there\nas there are everywhere, but there were some who thought more of being\nrich than of anything else--the sort of people that are called \"purse\nproud.\" And as children very often take after their parents, my father\nand mother did not like the idea of my having such children as my\ncompanions--children who would look down upon me for being poor, and\nperhaps treat me unkindly on that account.\n\n\"When Geraldine is older she must go to school,\" my father used to say,\n\"unless by that time our ship comes in and we can afford a governess.\nBut when she is older it will not matter so much, as she will have\nlearnt to value things at their just worth.\"\n\nI did not then understand what he meant, but I have never forgotten the\nwords.\n\nI was a very simple child. It never entered my head that there was\nanything to be ashamed of in living in a small house and having only two\nservants. I thought it would be _nice_ to have more money, so that mamma\nwould not need to be so busy and could have more pretty dresses, and\nabove all that we could then live in the country, but I never minded\nbeing poor in any sore or ashamed way. And I often envied Haddie, who\ndid go to school. I thought it would be nice to have lots of other\nlittle girls to play with. I remember once saying so to mamma, but she\nshook her head.\n\n\"I don't think you would like it as much as you fancy you would,\" she\nsaid. \"Not at present at least. When you are a few years older I hope to\nsend you for some classes to Miss Ledbury's school, and by that time you\nwill enjoy the good teaching. But except for the lessons, I am quite\nsure it is better and happier for you to be at home, even though you\nfind it rather lonely sometimes.\"\n\nAnd in his way Haddie said much the same. School was all very well for\nboys, he told me. If a fellow tried to bully you, you could bully him\nback. But girls weren't like that--they couldn't fight it out. And when\nI said to him I didn't want to fight, he still shook his head, and\nrepeated that I wouldn't like school at all--some of his friends'\nsisters were at school and they hated it.\n\nStill, though I did not often speak of it, the wish to go to school, and\nthe belief that I should find school-life very happy and interesting,\nremained in my mind. I often made up fancies about it, and pictured\nmyself doing lessons with other little girls and reading the same\nstory-books and playing duets together. I could not believe that I\nshould not like it. The truth was, I suppose, that I was longing for\ncompanions of my own age.\n\nIt was since Haddie went to school that I had felt lonely. I was a great\ndeal with mamma, but of course there were hours in the day when she was\ntaken up with other things and could not attend to me. I used to long\nthen for the holidays to come so that I should have Haddie again to play\nwith.\n\nMy happiest days were Wednesdays and Saturdays, for then he did not go\nto school in the afternoon. And mamma very often planned some little\ntreat for us on those days, such as staying up to have late tea with her\nand papa when he came in from his office, or reading aloud some new\nstory-book, or going a walk with her in the afternoon and buying\nwhatever we liked for our own tea at the confectioner's.\n\nVery simple treats--but then we were very simple children, as I have\nsaid already.\n\nOur house, though in a street quite filled with houses, was some little\nway from the centre of the town, where the best shops were--some years\nbefore, our street had, I suppose, been considered quite in the country.\nWe were very fond of going to the shops with mamma. We thought them very\ngrand and beautiful, though they were not nearly as pretty as shops are\nnowadays, for they were much smaller and darker, so that the things\ncould not be spread out in the attractive way they are now, nor were the\nthings themselves nearly as varied and tempting.\n\nThere was one shop which interested us very much. It belonged to the\nprincipal furniture-maker of Mexington. It scarcely looked like a shop,\nbut was more like a rather gloomy private house very full of heavy dark\ncabinets and tables and wardrobes and chairs, mostly of mahogany, and\nall extremely good and well made. Yes, furniture, though ugly, really\nwas very good in those days--I have one or two relics of my old home\nstill, in the shape of a leather-covered arm-chair and a\nbeautifully-made chest of drawers. For mamma's godmother had helped to\nfurnish our house when we came to Mexington, and she was the sort of old\nlady who when she _did_ give a present gave it really good of its kind.\nShe had had furniture herself made by Cranston--that was the\ncabinet-maker's name--for her home was in the country only about three\nhours' journey from Mexington--and it had been first-rate, so she\nordered what she gave mamma from him also.\n\nBut it was not because the furniture was so good that we liked going to\nCranston's. It was for quite another reason. A little way in from the\nfront entrance to the shop, where there were glass doors to swing open,\nstood a pair of huge lions carved in very dark, almost black, wood. They\nwere nearly, if not quite, as large as life, and the first time I saw\nthem, when I was only four or five, I was really frightened of them.\nThey guarded the entrance to the inner part of the shop, which was dark\nand gloomy and mysterious-looking, and I remember clutching fast hold of\nmamma's hand as we passed them, not feeling at all sure that they would\nnot suddenly spring forward and catch us. But when mamma saw that I was\nfrightened, she stopped and made me feel the lions and stroke them to\nshow me that they were only wooden and could not possibly hurt me. And\nafter that I grew very fond of them, and was always asking her to take\nme to the \"lion shop.\"\n\nHaddie liked them too--his great wish was to climb on one of their backs\nand play at going a ride.\n\nI don't think I thought of that. What I liked was to stroke their heavy\nmanes and fancy to myself what I would do if, all of a sudden, one of\nthem \"came alive,\" as I called it, and turned his head round and looked\nat me. And as I grew older, almost without knowing it, I made up all\nsorts of fairy fancies about the lions--I sometimes thought they were\nenchanted princes, sometimes that they were real lions who were only\ncarved wood in the day-time, and at night walked about wherever they\nliked.\n\nSo, for one reason or another, both Haddie and I were always very\npleased when mamma had to look in at Cranston's.\n\nThis happened oftener than might have been expected, considering that\nour house was small, and that my father and mother were not rich enough\noften to buy new furniture. For mamma's godmother seemed to be always\nordering something or other at the cabinet-maker's, and as she knew\nmamma was very sensible and careful, she used to write to her to explain\nto Cranston about the things she wanted, or to look at them before he\nsent them home, to see that they were all right. And Cranston was always\nvery polite indeed to mamma.\n\nHe himself was a stout, red-faced, little, elderly man, with gray\nwhiskers, which he brushed up in a fierce kind of way that made him look\nlike a rather angry cat, though he really was a very gentle and kind old\nman. I thought him much nicer than his partner, whose name was Berridge,\na tall, thin man, who talked very fast, and made a great show of\nscolding any of the clerks or workmen who happened to be about.\n\nMr. Cranston was very proud of the lions. They had belonged to his\ngrandfather and then to his father, who had both been in the same sort\nof business as he was, and he told mamma they had been carved in \"the\nEast.\" I didn't know what he meant by the East, and I don't now know\nwhat country he was alluding to--India or China or Japan. And I am not\nsure that he knew himself. But \"the East\" sounded far away and\nmysterious--it might do for fairyland or brownieland, and I was quite\nsatisfied. No doubt, wherever they came from, the lions were very\nbeautifully carved.\n\nNow I will go on to tell about the changes that came into our lives,\nclosing the doors of these first happy childish years, when there\nscarcely seemed to be ever a cloud on our sky.\n\nOne day, when I was a month or two past nine years old, mamma said to me\njust as I was finishing my practising--I used to practise half an hour\nevery other day, and have a music lesson from mamma the between\ndays--that she was going out to do some shopping that afternoon, and\nthat, if I liked, I might go with her.\n\n\"I hope it will not rain,\" she added, \"though it does look rather\nthreatening. But perhaps it will hold off till evening.\"\n\n\"And I can take my umbrella in case it rains,\" I said. I was very proud\nof my umbrella. It had been one of my last birthday presents. \"Yes,\nmamma, I should like to come very much. Will Haddie come too?\"\n\nFor it was Wednesday--one of his half-holidays.\n\n\"To tell the truth,\" said mamma, \"I forgot to ask him this morning if he\nwould like to come, but he will be home soon--it is nearly luncheon\ntime. I daresay he will like to come, especially as I have to go to\nCranston's.\"\n\nShe smiled a little as she said this. Our love for the carved lions\namused her.\n\n\"Oh yes, I am sure he will like to come,\" I said. \"And may we buy\nsomething for tea at Miss Fryer's on our way home?\"\n\nMamma smiled again.\n\n\"That will be two treats instead of one,\" she said, \"but I daresay I can\nafford two or three pence.\"\n\nMiss Fryer was our own pet confectioner, or pastry-cook, as we used to\nsay more frequently then. She was a Quakeress, and her shop was very\nnear our house, so near that mamma let me go there alone with Haddie.\nMiss Fryer was very grave and quiet, but we were not at all afraid of\nher, for we knew that she was really very kind. She was always dressed\nin pale gray or fawn colour, with a white muslin shawl crossed over her\nshoulders, and a white net cap beautifully quilled and fitting tightly\nround her face, so that only a very little of her soft gray hair\nshowed. She always spoke to us as \"thou\" and \"thee,\" and she was very\nparticular to give us exactly what we asked for, and also to take the\nexact money in payment. But now and then, after the business part had\nbeen all correctly settled, she would choose out a nice bun or\nsponge-cake, or two or three biscuits, and would say \"I give thee this\nas a present.\" And she did not like us to say, \"Thank you, Miss Fryer,\"\nbut \"Thank you, friend Susan.\" I daresay she would have liked us to say,\n\"Thank _thee_,\" but neither Haddie nor I had courage for that!\n\nI ran upstairs in high spirits, and five minutes after when Haddie came\nin from school he was nearly as pleased as I to hear our plans.\n\n\"If only it does not rain,\" said mamma at luncheon.\n\nLuncheon was, of course, our dinner, and it was often mamma's dinner\nreally too. Our father was sometimes so late of getting home that he\nliked better to have tea than a regular dinner. But mamma always called\nit luncheon because it seemed natural to her.\n\n\"I don't mind if it does rain,\" said Haddie, \"because of my new\nmackintosh.\"\n\nHaddie was very proud of his mackintosh, which father had got him for\ngoing to and from school in rainy weather. Mackintoshes were then a new\ninvention, and very expensive compared with what they are now. But\nHaddie was rather given to catching cold, and at Great Mexington it did\nrain very often--much oftener than anywhere else, I am quite sure.\n\n\"And Geraldine doesn't mind because of her new umbrella,\" said mamma.\n\"So we are proof against the weather, whatever happens.\"\n\nIt may seem strange that I can remember so much of a time now so very\nlong ago. But I really do--of that day and of those that followed it\nespecially, because, as I have already said, they were almost the close\nof the first part of our childish life.\n\nThat afternoon was such a happy one. We set off with mamma, one on each\nside of her, hanging on her arms, Haddie trying to keep step with her,\nand I skipping along on my tiptoes. When we got to the more crowded\nstreets we had to separate--that is to say, Haddie had to let go of\nmamma's arm, so that he could fall behind when we met more than one\nperson. For the pavements at Mexington were in some parts narrow and\nold-fashioned.\n\nMamma had several messages to do, and at some of the shops Haddie and I\nwaited outside because we did not think they were very interesting. But\nat some we were only too ready to go in. One I remember very well. It\nwas a large grocer's. We thought it a most beautiful shop, though\nnowadays it would be considered quite dull and gloomy, compared with the\nbrilliant places of the kind you see filled with biscuits and dried\nfruits and all kinds of groceries tied up with ribbons, or displayed in\nboxes of every colour of the rainbow. I must say I think the groceries\nthemselves were quite as good as they are now, and in some cases better,\nbut that may be partly my fancy, as I daresay I have a partiality for\nold-fashioned things.\n\nMamma did not buy all our groceries at this grand shop, for it was\nconsidered dear. But certain things, such as tea--which cost five\nshillings a pound then--she always ordered there. And the grocer, like\nCranston, was a very polite man. I think he understood that though she\nwas not rich, and never bought a great deal, mamma was different in\nherself from the grandly-dressed Mexington ladies who drove up to his\nshop in their carriages, with a long list of all the things they wanted.\nAnd when mamma had finished giving her order, he used always to offer\nHaddie and me a gingerbread biscuit of a very particular and delicious\nkind. They were large round biscuits, of a nice bright brown colour, and\nunderneath they had thin white wafer, which we called \"eating paper.\"\nThey were crisp without being hard. I never see gingerbreads like them\nnow.\n\n\"This is a lucky day, mamma,\" I said, when we came out of the grocer's.\n\"Mr. Simeon never forgets to give us gingerbreads when he is there\nhimself.\"\n\n\"No,\" said mamma, \"he is a very kind man. Perhaps he has got Haddies and\nGeraldines of his own, and knows what they like.\"\n\n\"And now are we going to Cranston's?\" asked my brother.\n\nMamma looked at the paper in her hand. She was very careful and\nmethodical in all her ways, and always wrote down what she had to do\nbefore she came out.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I think I have done everything else. But I shall be\nsome little time at Cranston's. Mrs. Selwood has asked me to settle ever\nso many things with him--she is going abroad for the winter, and wants\nhim to do a good deal of work at Fernley while she is away.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A HAPPY EVENING.\n\n\nHaddie and I were not at all sorry to hear that mamma's call at\nCranston's was not to be a hurried one.\n\n\"We don't mind if you are ever so long,\" I said; \"do we, Haddie?\"\n\n\"No, of course we don't,\" Haddie agreed. \"I should like to spend a whole\nday in those big show-rooms of his. Couldn't we have jolly games of\nhide-and-seek, Sis? And then riding the lions! I wish you were rich\nenough to buy one of the lions, mamma, and have it for an ornament in\nthe hall, or in the drawing-room.\"\n\n\"We should need to build a hall or a drawing-room to hold it,\" said\nmamma, laughing. \"I'm afraid your lion would turn into a white elephant,\nHaddie, if it became ours.\"\n\nI remember wondering what she meant. How could a lion turn into an\nelephant? But I was rather a slow child in some ways. Very often I\nthought a thing over a long time in my mind if I did not understand it\nbefore asking any one to explain it. And so before I said anything it\nwent out of my head, for here we were at Cranston's door.\n\nThere was only a young shopman to be seen, but when mamma told him she\nparticularly wanted to see Mr. Cranston himself, he asked us to step in\nand take a seat while he went to fetch him.\n\nWe passed between the lions. It seemed quite a long time since we had\nseen them, and I thought they looked at us very kindly. I was just\nnudging Haddie to whisper this to him when mamma stopped to say to us\nthat we might stay in the outer room if we liked; she knew it was our\nfavourite place, and in a few minutes we heard her talking to old Mr.\nCranston, who had come to her in the inner show-room through another\ndoor.\n\nHaddie's head was full of climbing up onto one of the lions to go a\nride. But luckily he could not find anything to climb up with, which was\na very good thing, as he would have been pretty sure to topple over, and\nMr. Cranston would not have been at all pleased if he had scratched the\nlion.\n\nTo keep him quiet I began talking to him about my fancies. I made him\nlook close into the lions' faces--it was getting late in the afternoon,\nand we had noticed before we came in that the sun was setting stormily.\nA ray of bright orange-coloured light found its way in through one of\nthe high-up windows which were at the back of the show-room, and fell\nright across the mane of one of the lions and almost into the eyes of\nthe other. The effect on the dark, almost black, wood of which they were\nmade was very curious.\n\n\"Look, Haddie,\" I said suddenly, catching his arm, \"doesn't it really\nlook as if they were smiling at us--the one with the light on its face\nespecially? I really do think there's something funny about them--I\nwonder if they are enchanted.\"\n\nHaddie did not laugh at me. I think in his heart he was fond of fancies\ntoo, though he might not have liked the boys at school to know it. He\nsat staring at our queer friends nearly as earnestly as I did myself.\nAnd as the ray of light slowly faded, he turned to me.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"their faces do seem to change. But I think they always\nlook kind.\"\n\n\"They do to _us_,\" I said confidently, \"but sometimes they are quite\nfierce. I don't think they looked at us the way they do now the first\ntime they saw us. And one day one of the men in the shop shoved\nsomething against one of them and his face frowned--I'm sure it did.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he'd frown if I got up on his back,\" said Haddie.\n\n\"Oh, do leave off about climbing on their backs,\" I said. \"It wouldn't\nbe at all comfortable--they're so broad, you couldn't sit cross-legs,\nand they'd be as slippery as anything. It's much nicer to make up\nstories about them coming alive in the night, or turning into black\nprinces and saying magic words to make the doors open like in the\nArabian Nights.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me stories of all they do then,\" said Haddie\ncondescendingly.\n\n\"I will if you'll let me think for a minute,\" I said. \"I wish Aunty Etta\nwas here--she does know such lovely stories.\"\n\n\"I like yours quite as well,\" said Haddie encouragingly, \"I don't\nremember Aunty Etta's; it's such a long time since I saw her. You saw\nher last year, you know, but I didn't.\"\n\n\"She told me one about a china parrot, a most beautiful green and gold\nparrot, that was really a fairy,\" I said. \"I think I could turn it into\na lion story, if I thought about it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Haddie, \"you can tell the parrot one another time. I'd rather\nhear one of your own stories, new, about the lions. I know you've got\nsome in your head. Begin, do--I'll help you if you can't get on.\"\n\nBut my story that afternoon was not to be heard. Just as I was beginning\nwith, \"Well, then, there was once an old witch who lived in a very\nlonely hut in the middle of a great forest,\" there came voices behind\nus, and in another moment we heard mamma saying,\n\n\"Haddie, my boy, Geraldine, I am quite ready.\"\n\nI was not very sorry. I liked to have more time to make up my stories,\nand Haddie sometimes hurried me so. It was Aunty Etta, I think, who had\nfirst put it into my head to make them. She was _so_ clever about it\nherself, both in making stories and in remembering those she had read,\nand she _had_ read a lot. But she was away in India at the time I am now\nwriting about; her going so far off was a great sorrow to mamma.\n\nHaddie and I started up at once. We had to be very obedient, what father\ncalled \"quickly obedient,\" and though he was so kind he was very strict\ntoo.\n\n\"My children are great admirers of your lions, Mr. Cranston,\" mamma\nsaid; and the old man smiled.\n\n\"They are not singular in their taste, madam,\" he said. \"I own that I am\nvery proud of them myself, and when my poor daughter was a child there\nwas nothing pleased her so much as when her mother or I lifted her on to\none of them, and made believe she was going a ride.\"\n\nHaddie looked triumphant.\n\n\"There now you see, Sis,\" he whispered, nudging me.\n\nBut I did not answer him, for I was listening to what mamma was saying.\n\n\"Oh, by the bye, Mr. Cranston,\" she went on, \"I was forgetting to ask\nhow your little grandchild is. Have you seen her lately?\"\n\nOld Cranston's face brightened.\n\n\"She is very well, madam, I thank you,\" he replied. \"And I am pleased to\nsay that she is coming to stay with us shortly. We hope to keep her\nthrough the winter. Her stepmother is very kind, but with little\nchildren of her own, it is not always easy for her to give as much\nattention as she would like to Myra, and she and Mr. Raby have responded\ncordially to our invitation.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear it--very glad indeed,\" said mamma. \"I know what\na pleasure it will be to you and Mrs. Cranston. Let me see--how old is\nthe little girl now--seven, eight?\"\n\n\"_Nine_, madam, getting on for ten indeed,\" said Mr. Cranston with\npride.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said mamma, \"how time passes! I remember seeing her when she\nwas a baby--before we came to live here, of course, once when I was\nstaying at Fernley, just after----\"\n\nMamma stopped and hesitated.\n\n\"Just after her poor mother died--yes, madam,\" said the old man quietly.\n\nAnd then we left, Mr. Cranston respectfully holding the door open.\n\nIt was growing quite dark; the street-lamps were lighted and their gleam\nwas reflected on the pavement, for it had been raining and was still\nquite wet underfoot. Mamma looked round her.\n\n\"You had better put on your mackintosh, Haddie,\" she said. \"It may rain\nagain. No, Geraldine dear, there is no use opening your umbrella till it\ndoes rain.\"\n\nMy feelings were divided between pride in my umbrella and some\nreluctance to have it wet! I took hold of mamma's arm again, while\nHaddie walked at her other side. It was not a very cheerful prospect\nbefore us--the gloomy dirty streets of Mexington were now muddy and\nsloppy as well--though on the whole I don't know but that they looked\nrather more cheerful by gaslight than in the day. It was chilly too, for\nthe season was now very late autumn, if not winter. But little did we\ncare--I don't think there could have been found anywhere two happier\nchildren than my brother and I that dull rainy evening as we trotted\nalong beside our mother. There was the feeling of _her_ to take care of\nus, of our cheerful home waiting for us, with a bright fire and the\ntea-table all spread. If I had not been a little tired--for we had\nwalked a good way--in my heart I was just as ready to skip along on the\ntips of my toes as when we first came out.\n\n\"We may stop at Miss Fryer's, mayn't we, mamma?\" said Haddie.\n\n\"Well, yes, I suppose I promised you something for tea,\" mamma replied.\n\n\"How much may we spend?\" he asked. \"Sixpence--do say sixpence, and then\nwe can get enough for you to have tea with us too.\"\n\n\"Haddie,\" I said reproachfully, \"as if we wouldn't give mamma something\nhowever little we had!\"\n\n\"We'd offer it her of course, but you know she wouldn't take it,\" he\nreplied. \"So it's much better to have really enough for all.\"\n\nHis way of speaking made mamma laugh again.\n\n\"Then I suppose it must be sixpence,\" she said, \"and here we are at Miss\nFryer's. Shall we walk on, my little girl, I think you must be tired,\nand let Haddie invest in cakes and run after us?\"\n\n\"Oh no, please mamma, dear,\" I said, \"I like so to choose too.\"\n\nHalf the pleasure of the sixpence would have been gone if Haddie and I\nhad not spent it together.\n\n\"Then I will go on,\" said mamma, \"and you two can come after me\ntogether.\"\n\nShe took out her purse and gave my brother the promised money, and then\nwith a smile on her dear face--I can see her now as she stood in the\nlight of the street-lamp just at the old Quakeress's door--she nodded to\nus and turned to go.\n\nI remember exactly what we bought, partly, perhaps, because it was our\nusual choice. We used to think it over a good deal first and each would\nsuggest something different, but in the end we nearly always came back\nto the old plan for the outlay of our sixpence, namely, half-penny\ncrumpets for threepence--that meant _seven_, not six; it was the\nreceived custom to give seven for threepence--and half-penny Bath buns\nfor the other threepence--seven of them too, of course. And _Bath_ buns,\nnot plain ones. You cannot get these now--not at least in any place\nwhere I have lived of late years. And I am not sure but that even at\nMexington they were a _spécialité_ of dear old Miss Fryer's. They were\nso good; indeed, everything she sold was thoroughly good of its kind.\nShe was so honest, using the best materials for all she made.\n\nThat evening she stood with her usual gentle gravity while we discussed\nwhat we should have, and when after discarding sponge-cakes and\nfinger-biscuits, which we had thought of \"for a change,\" and partly\nbecause finger-biscuits weighed light and made a good show, we came\nround at last to the seven crumpets and seven buns, she listened as\nseriously and put them up in their little paper bags with as much\ninterest as though the ceremony had never been gone through before. And\nthen just as we were turning to leave, she lifted up a glass shade and\ndrew out two cheese-cakes, which she proceeded to put into another paper\nbag.\n\nHaddie and I looked at each other. This was a lovely present. What a tea\nwe should have!\n\n\"I think thee will find these good,\" she said with a smile, \"and I hope\nthy dear mother will not think them too rich for thee and thy brother.\"\n\nShe put them into my hand, and of course we thanked her heartily. I have\noften wondered why she never said, \"thou wilt,\" but always \"thee will,\"\nfor she was not an uneducated woman by any means.\n\nLaden with our treasures Haddie and I hurried home. There was mamma\nwatching for us with the door open. How sweet it was to have her always\nto welcome us!\n\n\"Tea is quite ready, dears,\" she said. \"Run upstairs quickly, Geraldine,\nand take off your things, they must be rather damp. I am going to have\nmy real tea with you, for I have just had a note from your father to say\nhe won't be in till late and I am not to wait for him.\"\n\nMamma sighed a little as she spoke. I felt sorry for her disappointment,\nbut, selfishly speaking, we sometimes rather enjoyed the evenings father\nwas late, for then mamma gave us her whole attention, as she was not\nable to do when he was at home. And though we were very fond of our\nfather, we were--I especially, I think--much more afraid of him than of\nour mother.\n\nAnd that was such a happy evening! I have never forgotten it. Mamma was\nso good and thoughtful for us, she did not let us find out in the least\nthat she was feeling anxious on account of something father had said in\nhis note to her. She was just perfectly sweet.\n\nWe were very proud of our spoils from Miss Fryer's. We wanted mamma to\nhave one cheesecake and Haddie and I to divide the other between us. But\nmamma would not agree to that. She would only take a half, so that we\nhad three-quarters each.\n\n\"Wasn't it kind of Miss Fryer, mamma?\" I said.\n\n\"Very kind,\" said mamma. \"I think she is really fond of children though\nshe is so grave. She has not forgotten what it was to be a child\nherself.\"\n\nSomehow her words brought back to my mind what old Mr. Cranston had said\nabout his little grand-daughter.\n\n\"I suppose children _are_ all rather like each other,\" I said. \"Like\nabout Haddie, and that little girl riding on the lions.\"\n\nHaddie was not very pleased at my speaking of it; he was beginning to be\nafraid of seeming babyish.\n\n\"That was _quite_ different,\" he said. \"She was a baby and had to be\nheld on. It was the fun of climbing up _I_ cared for.\"\n\n\"She wasn't a baby,\" I said. \"She's nine years old, he said she\nwas--didn't he, mamma?\"\n\n\"You are mixing two things together,\" said mamma. \"Mr. Cranston was\nspeaking first of his daughter long ago when she was a child, and then\nhe was speaking of _her_ daughter, little Myra Raby, who is now nine\nyears old.\"\n\n\"Why did he say my 'poor' daughter?\" I asked.\n\n\"Did you not hear the allusion to her death? Mrs. Raby died soon after\nlittle Myra was born. Mr. Raby married again--he is a clergyman not very\nfar from Fernley----\"\n\n\"A clergyman,\" exclaimed Haddie. He was more worldly-wise than I, thanks\nto being at school. \"A clergyman, and he married a shopkeeper's\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"There are very different kinds of shopkeepers, Haddie,\" said mamma.\n\"Mr. Cranston is very rich, and his daughter was very well educated and\nvery nice. Still, no doubt Mr. Raby was in a higher position than she,\nand both Mr. Cranston and his wife are very right-minded people, and\nnever pretend to be more than they are. That is why I was so glad to\nhear that little Myra is coming to stay with them. I was afraid the\nsecond Mrs. Raby might have looked down upon them perhaps.\"\n\nHaddie said no more about it. And though I listened to what mamma said,\nI don't think I quite took in the sense of it till a good while\nafterwards. It has often been like that with me in life. I have a\ncuriously \"retentive\" memory, as it is called. Words and speeches remain\nin my mind like unread letters, till some day, quite unexpectedly,\nsomething reminds me of them, and I take them out, as it were, and find\nwhat they really meant.\n\nBut just now my only interest in little Myra Raby's history was a\npresent one.\n\n\"Mamma,\" I said suddenly, \"if she is a nice little girl like what her\nmamma was, mightn't I have her to come and see me and play with me? I\nhave never had any little girl to play with, and it is so dull\nsometimes--the days that Haddie is late at school and when you are busy.\nDo say I may have her--I'm sure old Mr. Cranston would let her come, and\nthen I might go and play with her sometimes perhaps. Do you think she\nwill play among the furniture--where the lions are?\"\n\nMamma shook her head.\n\n\"No, dear,\" she answered. \"I am quite sure her grandmother would not\nlike that. For you see anybody might come into the shop or show-rooms,\nand it would not seem nice for a little girl to be playing there--not\nnice for a carefully brought-up little girl, I mean.\"\n\n\"Then I don't think I should care to go to her house,\" I said, \"but I\nwould like her to come here. Please let her, mamma dear.\"\n\nBut mamma only said,\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\nAfter tea she told us stories--some of them we had heard often before,\nbut we never tired of hearing them again--about when she and Aunty Etta\nwere little girls. They were lovely stories--real ones of course. Mamma\nwas not as clever as Aunty Etta about making up fairy ones.\n\nWe were quite sorry when it was time to go to bed.\n\nAfter I had been asleep for a little that night I woke up again--I had\nnot been very sound asleep. Just then I saw a light, and mamma came into\nthe room with a candle.\n\n\"I'm not asleep, dear mamma,\" I said. \"Do kiss me again.\"\n\n\"That is what I have come for,\" she answered.\n\nAnd she came up to the bedside and kissed me, oh so sweetly--more than\nonce. She seemed as if she did not want to let go of me.\n\n\"Dear mamma,\" I whispered sleepily, \"I _am_ so happy--I'm always happy,\nbut to-night I feel so _extra_ happy, somehow.\"\n\n\"Darling,\" said mamma.\n\nAnd she kissed me again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. COMING EVENTS.\n\n\nThe shadow of coming changes began to fall over us very soon after that.\n\nIndeed, the very next morning at breakfast I noticed that mamma looked\npale and almost as if she had been crying, and father was, so to say,\n\"extra\" kind to her and to me. He talked and laughed more than usual,\npartly perhaps to prevent our noticing how silent dear mamma was, but\nmostly I think because that is the way men do when they are really\nanxious or troubled.\n\nI don't fancy Haddie thought there was anything wrong--he was in a hurry\nto get off to school.\n\nAfter breakfast mamma told me to go and practise for half an hour, and\nif she did not come to me then, I had better go on doing some of my\nlessons alone. She would look them over afterwards. And as I was going\nout of the room she called me back and kissed me again--almost as she\nhad done the night before.\n\nThat gave me courage to say something. For children were not, in my\nchildish days, on such free and easy terms with their elders as they are\nnow. And kind and gentle as mamma was, we knew very distinctly the sort\nof things she would think forward or presuming on our part.\n\n\"Mamma,\" I said, still hesitating a little.\n\n\"Well, dear,\" she replied. She was buttoning, or pretending to button,\nthe band of the little brown holland apron I wore, so that I could not\nsee her face, but something in the tone of her voice told me that my\ninstinct was not mistaken.\n\n\"Mamma,\" I repeated, \"may I say something? I have a feeling that--that\nyou are--that there is something the matter.\"\n\nMamma did not answer at once. Then she said very gently, but quite\nkindly,\n\n\"Geraldine, my dear, you know that I tell you as much as I think it\nright to tell any one as young as you--I tell you more, of our plans and\nprivate matters and such things, than most mothers tell their little\ndaughters. This has come about partly through your being so much alone\nwith me. But when I _don't_ tell you anything, even though you may\nsuspect there is something to tell, you should trust me that there is\ngood reason for my not doing so.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, but I could not stifle a little sigh. \"Would you just\ntell me one thing, mamma,\" I went on; \"it isn't anything that you're\nreally unhappy about, is it?\"\n\nAgain mamma hesitated.\n\n\"Dear child,\" she said, \"try to put it out of your mind. I can only say\nthis much to you, I am _anxious_ more than troubled. There is nothing\nthe matter that should really be called a trouble. But your father and I\nhave a question of great importance to decide just now, and we are\nvery--I may say really _terribly_--anxious to decide for the best. That\nis all I can tell you. Kiss me, my darling, and try to be your own\nbright little self. That will be a comfort and help to me.\"\n\nI kissed her and I promised I would try to do as she wished. But it was\nwith rather a heavy heart that I went to my practising. What _could_ it\nbe? I did try not to think of it, but it would keep coming back into my\nmind. And I was only a child. I had no experience of trouble or anxiety.\nAfter a time my spirits began to rise again--there was a sort of\nexcitement in the wondering what this great matter could be. I am afraid\nI did not succeed in putting it out of my mind as mamma wished me to do.\n\nBut the days went on without anything particular happening. I did not\nspeak of what mamma had said to me to my brother. I knew she did not\nwish me to do so. And by degrees other things began to make me forget\nabout it a little. It was just at that time, I remember, that some\nfriend--an aunt on father's side, I think--sent me a present of _The\nWide, Wide World_, and while I was reading it I seemed actually to live\nin the story. It was curious that I should have got it just then. If\nmamma had read it herself I am not sure that she would have given it to\nme. But after all, perhaps it served the purpose of preparing me a\n_little_--a very little--for what was before me in my own life.\n\nIt was nearly three weeks after the time I have described rather\nminutely that the blow fell, that Haddie and I were told the whole. I\nthink, however, I will not go on telling _how_ we were told, for I am\nafraid of making my story too long.\n\nAnd of course, however good my memory is, I cannot pretend that the\nconversations I relate took place _exactly_ as I give them. I think I\ngive the _spirit_ of them correctly, but now that I have come to the\ntelling of distinct facts, perhaps it will be better simply to narrate\nthem.\n\nYou will remember my saying that my father had lost money very\nunexpectedly, and that this was what had obliged him to come to live at\nMexington and work so hard. He had got the post he held there--it was in\na bank--greatly through the influence of Mrs. Selwood, mamma's\ngodmother, who lived in the country at some hours' distance from the\ntown, and whose name was well known there, as she owned a great many\nhouses and other property in the immediate neighbourhood.\n\nFather was very glad to get this post, and very grateful to Mrs.\nSelwood. She took great interest in us all--that is to say, she was\ninterested in Haddie and me because we were mamma's children, though she\ndid not care for or understand children as a rule. But she was a\nfaithful friend, and anxious to help father still more.\n\nJust about the time I have got to in my story, the manager of a bank in\nSouth America, in some way connected with the one at Great Mexington,\nbecame ill, and was told by the doctors that he must return to England\nand have a complete rest for two years. Mrs. Selwood had money\nconnection with this bank too, and got to hear of what had happened.\nKnowing that father could speak both French and Spanish well, for he had\nbeen in the diplomatic service as a younger man, she at once applied for\nthe appointment for him, and after some little delay she was told that\nhe should have the offer of it for the two years.\n\nTwo years are not a very long time, even though the pay was high, but\nthe great advantage of the offer was that the heads of the bank at\nMexington promised, if all went well for that time, that some permanent\npost should be given to father in England on his return. This was what\nmade him more anxious to accept the proposal than even the high pay. For\nMrs. Selwood found out that he would not be able to save much of his\nsalary, as he would have a large house to keep up, and would be expected\nto receive many visitors. On this account the post was never given to an\nunmarried man.\n\n\"If he accepts it,\" Mrs. Selwood wrote to mamma, \"you, my dear Blanche,\nmust go with him, and some arrangement would have to be made about the\nchildren for the time. I would advise your sending them to school.\"\n\n_Now_ I think my readers will not be at a loss to understand why our\ndear mother had looked so troubled, even though on one side this event\npromised to be for our good in the end.\n\nFather was allowed two or three weeks in which to make up his mind. The\nheads of the Mexington bank liked and respected him very much, and they\nquite saw that there were two sides to the question of his accepting the\noffer. The climate of the place was not very good--at least it was\ninjurious to English people if they stayed there for long--and it was\nperfectly certain that it would be madness to take growing children like\nHaddie and me there.\n\n_This_ was the dark spot in it all to mamma, and indeed to father too.\nThey were not afraid for themselves. They were both strong and still\nyoung, but they could not for a moment entertain the idea of taking\n_us_. And the thought of separation was terrible.\n\nYou see, being a small family, and living in a place like Great\nMexington, where my parents had not many congenial friends, and being\npoor were obliged to live carefully, _home_ was everything to us all.\nWe four were the whole world to each other, and knew no happiness apart.\n\nI do not mean to say that I felt or saw all this at once, but looking\nback upon it from the outside, as it were, I see all that made it a\npeculiarly hard case, especially--at the beginning, that is to say--for\nmamma.\n\nIt seems strange that I did _not_ take it all in--all the misery of it,\nI mean--at first, nor indeed for some time, not till I had actual\nexperience of it. Even Haddie realised it more in anticipation than I\ndid. He was two years older, and though he had never been at a\nboarding-school, still he knew something of school life. There were\nboarders at his school, and he had often seen and heard how, till they\ngot accustomed to it at any rate, they suffered from home-sickness, and\ncounted the days to the holidays.\n\nAnd for us there were not to be any holidays! No certain prospect of\nthem at best, though Mrs. Selwood said something vaguely about perhaps\nhaving us at Fernley for a visit in the summer. But it was very vague.\nAnd we had no near relations on mamma's side except Aunty Etta, who was\nin India, and on father's no one who could possibly have us regularly\nfor our holidays.\n\nAll this mamma grasped at once, and her grief was sometimes so extreme\nthat, but for Mrs. Selwood, I doubt if father would have had the\nresolution to accept. But Mrs. Selwood was what is called \"very\nsensible,\" perhaps just a little hard, and certainly not _sensitive_.\nAnd she put things before our parents in such a way that mamma felt it\nher duty to urge father to accept the offer, and father felt it _his_\nduty to put feelings aside and do so.\n\nThey went to stay at Fernley from a Saturday to a Monday to talk it well\nover, and it was when they came back on the Monday that we were told.\n\nBefore then I think we had both come to have a strong feeling that\nsomething was going to happen. I, of course, had some reason for this in\nwhat mamma had said to me, though I had forgotten about it a good deal,\ntill this visit to Fernley brought back the idea of something unusual.\nFor it was _very_ seldom that we were left by ourselves.\n\nWe did not mind it much. After all, it was only two nights and one\n_whole_ day, and that a Sunday, when my brother was at home, so we\nstood at the door cheerfully enough, looking at our father and mother\ndriving off in the clumsy, dingy old four-wheeler--though that is a\nmodern word--which was the best kind of cab known at Mexington.\n\nBut when they were fairly off Haddie turned to me, and I saw that he was\nvery grave. I was rather surprised.\n\n\"Why, Haddie,\" I said, \"do you mind so much? They'll be back on Monday.\"\n\n\"No, of course I don't mind _that_,\" he said. \"But I wonder why mamma\nlooks so--so awfully trying-not-to-cry, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"I don't think she's quite well. And she hates leaving\nus.\"\n\n\"No,\" said my brother, \"there's something more.\"\n\nAnd when he said that, I remembered the feeling I had had myself. I felt\nrather cross with Haddie; I wanted to forget it quite.\n\n\"You needn't try to frighten me like that,\" I said. \"I meant to be quite\nhappy while they were away--to please mamma, you know, by telling her so\nwhen she comes back.\"\n\nThen Haddie, who really was a very good-natured, kind boy, looked\nsorry.\n\n\"I didn't mean to frighten you,\" he said; \"perhaps it was my fancy. I\ndon't want to be unhappy while they're away, I'm sure. I'm only too glad\nthat to-day's Saturday and to-morrow Sunday.\"\n\nAnd he did his very best to amuse me. We went out a walk that afternoon\nwith the housemaid--quite a long walk, though it was winter. We went as\nfar out of the town as we could get, to where there were fields, which\nin spring and summer still looked green, and through the remains of a\nlittle wood, pleasant even in the dullest season. It was our favourite\nwalk, and the only pretty one near the town. There was a brook at the\nedge of the wood, which still did its best to sing merrily, and to\nforget how dingy and grimy its clear waters became a mile or two farther\non; there were still a few treasures in the shape of ivy sprays and\nautumn-tinted leaves to gather and take home with us to deck our\nnursery.\n\nI remember the look of it all so well. It was the favourite walk of many\nbesides ourselves, especially on a Saturday, when the hard-worked\nMexington folk were once free to ramble about--boys and girls not much\nolder than ourselves among them, for in those days children were allowed\nto work in factories much younger than they do now. We did not mind\nmeeting some of our townsfellows. On the contrary, we felt a good deal\nof interest in them and liked to hear their queer way of talking, though\nwe could scarcely understand anything they said. And we were very much\ninterested indeed in some of the stories Lydia, who belonged to this\npart of the country, told us of her own life, in a village a few miles\naway, where there were two or three great factories, at which all the\npeople about worked--men, women, and children too, so that sometimes,\nexcept for babies and very old people, the houses seemed quite deserted.\n\n\"And long ago before that,\" said Lydia, \"when mother was a little lass,\nit was such a pretty village--cottages all over with creepers and\nhoneysuckle--not ugly rows of houses as like each other as peas. The\npeople worked at home on their own hand-looms then.\"\n\nLydia had a sense of the beautiful!\n\nOn our way home, of course, we called at Miss Fryer's--this time we had\na whole shilling to spend, for there was Sunday's tea to think of as\nwell as to-day's. We had never had so much at a time, and our\nconsultation took a good while. We decided at last on seven crumpets\nand seven Bath buns as usual, and in addition to these, three large\ncurrant tea-cakes, which our friend Susan told us would be all the\nbetter for toasting if not too fresh. And the remaining threepence we\ninvested in a slice of sweet sandwich, which she told us would be\nperfectly good if kept in a tin tightly closed. The old Quakeress for\nonce, I have always suspected, departed on this occasion from her rule\nof exact payment for all purchases, for it certainly seemed a very large\nslice of sweet sandwich for threepence.\n\nWe were rather tired with our walk that evening and went to bed early.\nNothing more was said by Haddie about his misgivings. I think he hoped I\nhad forgotten what had passed, but I had not. It had all come back\nagain, the strange feeling of change and trouble in the air which had\nmade me question mamma that morning two or three weeks ago.\n\nBut I did not as yet really believe it. I had never known what sorrow\nand trouble actually are. It is not many children who reach even the age\nI was then with so sunny and peaceful an experience of life. That\nanything could happen to us--to _me_--like what happened to \"Ellen\" in\n_The Wide, Wide World_, I simply could not believe; even though if any\none had talked to me about it and said that troubles must come and _do_\ncome to all, and to some much more than to others, and that they might\nbe coming to us, I should have agreed at once and said yes, of course I\nknew that was true.\n\nThe next day, Sunday, was very rainy. It made us feel dull, I think,\nthough we did not really mind a wet Sunday as much as another day, for\nwe never went a walk on Sunday. It was not thought right, and as we had\nno garden the day would have been a very dreary one to us, except for\nmamma.\n\nShe managed to make it pleasant. We went to church in the morning, and\nin the evening too sometimes. I think all children like going to church\nin the evening; there is something grown-up about it. And the rest of\nthe day mamma managed to find interesting things for us to do. She\ngenerally had some book which she kept for reading aloud on Sunday--Dr.\nAdams's _Allegories_, \"The Dark River\" and others, were great\nfavourites, and so were Bishop Wilberforce's _Agathos_. Some of them\nfrightened me a little, but it was rather a pleasant sort of fright,\nthere was something grand and solemn about it.\n\nThen we sang hymns sometimes, and we always had a very nice tea, and\nmamma, and father too now and then, told us stories about when they were\nchildren and what they did on Sundays. It was much stricter for them\nthan for us, though even for us many things were forbidden on Sundays\nwhich are now thought not only harmless but right.\n\nStill, I never look back to the quiet Sundays in the dingy Mexington\nstreet with anything but a feeling of peace and gentle pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. ALL SETTLED.\n\n\nThat Sunday--that last Sunday I somehow feel inclined to call it--stands\nout in my memory quite differently from its fellows. Both Haddie and I\nfelt dull and depressed, partly owing no doubt to the weather, but still\nmore, I think, from that vague fear of something being wrong which we\nwere both suffering from, though we would not speak of it to each other.\n\nIt cleared up a little in the evening, and though it was cold and chilly\nwe went to church. Mamma had said to us we might if we liked, and Lydia\nwas going.\n\nWhen we came in, cook sent us a little supper which we were very glad\nof; it cheered us up.\n\n\"Aren't you thankful they're coming home to-morrow?\" I said to Haddie.\n\"I've never minded their being away so much before.\"\n\nThey had been away two or three times that we could remember, though\nnever for longer than a day or two.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Haddie, \"I'm very glad.\"\n\nBut that was all he said.\n\nThey did come back the next day, pretty early in the morning, as father\nhad to be at the bank. He went straight there from the railway station,\nand mamma drove home with the luggage. She was very particular when she\nwent to stay with her godmother to take nice dresses, for Mrs. Selwood\nwould not have been pleased to see her looking shabby, and it would not\nhave made her any more sympathising or anxious to help, but rather the\nother way. Long afterwards--at least some years afterwards, when I was\nold enough to understand--I remember Mrs. Selwood saying to me that it\nwas mamma's courage and good management which made everybody respect\nher.\n\nI was watching at the dining-room window, which looked out to the\nstreet, when the cab drove up. After the heavy rain the day before, it\nwas for once a fine day, with some sunshine. And sunshine was rare at\nGreat Mexington, especially in late November.\n\nMamma was looking out to catch the first glimpse of me--of course she\nknew that my brother would be at school. There was a sort of sunshine\non her face, at least I thought so at first, for she was smiling. But\nwhen I looked more closely there was something in the smile which gave\nme a queer feeling, startling me almost more than if I had seen that she\nwas crying.\n\nI think for my age I had a good deal of self-control of a certain kind.\nI waited till she had come in and kissed me and sent away the cab and we\nwere alone. Then I shut the door and drew her to father's special\narm-chair beside the fire.\n\n\"Mamma, dear,\" I half said, half whispered, \"what is it?\"\n\nMamma gave a sort of gasp or choke before she answered. Then she said,\n\n\"Why, dear, why should you think--oh, I don't know what I am saying,\"\nand she tried to laugh.\n\nBut I wouldn't let her.\n\n\"It's something in your face, mamma,\" I persisted.\n\nShe was silent for a moment.\n\n\"We had meant to tell you and Haddie this evening,\" she said, \"father\nand I together; but perhaps it is better. Yes, my Geraldine, there is\nsomething. Till now it was not quite certain, though it has been hanging\nover us for some weeks, ever since----\"\n\n\"Since that day I asked you--the morning after father came home so late\nand you had been crying?\"\n\n\"Yes, since then,\" said mamma.\n\nShe put her arm round me, and then she told me all that I have told\nalready, or at least as much of it as she thought I could understand.\nShe told it quietly, but she did not try not to cry--the tears just came\ntrickling down her face, and she wiped them away now and then. I think\nthe letting them come made her able to speak more calmly.\n\nAnd I listened. I was very sorry for her, very _very_ sorry. But you may\nthink it strange--I have often looked back upon it with wonder myself,\nthough I now feel as if I understood the causes of it better--when I\ntell you that I was _not_ fearfully upset or distressed myself. I did\nnot feel inclined to cry, _except_ out of pity for mamma. And I listened\nwith the most intense interest, and even curiosity. I was all wound up\nby excitement, for this was the first great event I had ever known, the\nfirst change in my quiet child-life.\n\nAnd my excitement grew even greater when mamma came to the subject of\nwhat was decided about us children.\n\n\"Haddie of course must go to school,\" she said; \"to a larger and better\nschool--Mrs. Selwood speaks of Rugby, if it can be managed. He will be\nhappy there, every one says. But about you, my Geraldine.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma,\" I interrupted, \"do let me go to school too. I have always\nwanted to go, you know, and except for being away from you, I would far\nrather be a boarder. It's really being at school then. I know they\nrather look down upon day-scholars--Haddie says so.\"\n\nMamma looked at me gravely. Perhaps she was just a little disappointed,\neven though on the other hand she may have felt relieved too, at my\ntaking the idea of this separation, which to her over-rode _everything_,\nwhich made the next two years a black cloud to her, so very\nphilosophically. But she sighed. I fancy a suspicion of the truth came\nto her almost at once and added to her anxiety--the truth that I did not\nthe least realise what was before me.\n\n\"We _are_ thinking of sending you to school, my child,\" she said\nquietly, \"and of course it must be as a boarder. Mrs. Selwood advises\nMiss Ledbury's school here. She has known the old lady long and has a\nvery high opinion of her, and it is not very far from Fernley in case\nMiss Ledbury wished to consult Mrs. Selwood about you in any way, or in\ncase you were ill.\"\n\n\"I am very glad,\" I said. \"I should like to go to Miss Ledbury's.\"\n\nMy fancy had been tickled by seeing the girls at her school walking out\ntwo and two in orthodox fashion. I thought it must be delightful to\nmarch along in a row like that, and to have a partner of your own size\nto talk to as much as you liked.\n\nMamma said no more just then. I think she felt at a loss what to say.\nShe was afraid of making me unnecessarily unhappy, and on the other hand\nshe dreaded my finding the reality all the worse when I came to contrast\nit with my rose-coloured visions.\n\nShe consulted father, and he decided that it was best to leave me to\nmyself and my own thoughts.\n\n\"She is a very young child still,\" he said to mamma. (All this of course\nI was told afterwards.) \"It is quite possible that she will _not_ suffer\nfrom the separation as we have feared. It may be much easier for her\nthan if she had been two or three years older.\"\n\nHaddie had no illusions. From the very first he took it all in, and\nthat very bitterly. But he was, as I have said, a very good boy, and a\nboy with a great deal of resolution and firmness. He said nothing to\ndiscourage me. Mamma told him how surprised she was at my way of taking\nit, and he agreed with father that perhaps I would not be really\nunhappy.\n\nAnd I do think that my chief unhappiness during the next few weeks came\nfrom the sight of dear mamma's pale, worn face, which she could not\nhide, try as she might to be bright and cheerful.\n\nThere was of course a great deal of bustle and preparation, and all\nchildren enjoy that, I fancy. Even Haddie was interested about his\nschool outfit. He was to go to a preparatory school at Rugby till he\ncould get into the big school. And as far as school went, he told me he\nwas sure he would like it very well, it was only the--but there he\nstopped.\n\n\"The what?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, the being all separated,\" he said gruffly.\n\n\"But you'd have had to go away to a big school some day,\" I reminded\nhim. \"You didn't want always to go to a day-school.\"\n\n\"No,\" he allowed, \"but it's the holidays.\"\n\nThe holidays! I had not thought about that part of it.\n\n\"Oh, I daresay something nice will be settled for the holidays,\" I said\nlightly.\n\nIn one way Haddie was very lucky. Mrs. Selwood had undertaken the whole\ncharge of his education for the two years our parents were to be away.\nAnd after that \"we shall see,\" she said.\n\nShe had great ideas about the necessity of giving a boy the very best\nschooling possible, but she had not at all the same opinion about\n_girls'_ education. She was a clever woman in some ways, but very\nold-fashioned. Her own upbringing had been at a time when _very_ little\nlearning was considered needful or even advisable for our sex. And as\nshe had good practical capacities, and had managed her own affairs\nsensibly, she always held herself up both in her own mind and to others\nas a specimen of an _un_learned lady who had got on far better than if\nshe had had all the \"'ologies,\" as she called them, at her fingers'\nends.\n\nThis, I think, was one reason why she approved of Miss Ledbury's school,\nwhich, as you will hear, was certainly not conducted in accordance with\nthe modern ideas which even then were beginning to make wise parents\nask themselves if it was right to spend ten times as much on their sons'\neducation as on their daughters'.\n\n\"Teach a girl to write a good hand, to read aloud so that you can\nunderstand what she says, to make a shirt and make a pudding and to add\nup the butcher's book correctly, and she'll do,\" Mrs. Selwood used to\nsay.\n\n\"And what about accomplishments?\" some one might ask.\n\n\"She should be able to play a tune on the piano, and to sing a nice\nEnglish song or two if she has a voice, and maybe to paint a wreath of\nflowers if her taste lies that way. That sort of thing would do no harm\nif she doesn't waste time over it,\" the old lady would allow, with great\nliberality, thinking over her own youthful acquirements no doubt.\n\nI daresay there was a foundation of solid sense in the first part of her\nadvice. I don't see but that girls nowadays might profit by some of it.\nAnd in many cases they _do_. It is quite in accordance with modern\nthought to be able to make a good many \"puddings,\" though home-made\nshirts are not called for. But as far as the \"accomplishments\" go, I\nshould prefer none to such a smattering of them as our old friend\nconsidered more than enough.\n\nSo far less thought on Mrs. Selwood's part was bestowed on\nGeraldine--that is myself, of course--than on Haddon, as regarded the\nschool question. And mamma _had_ to be guided by Mrs. Selwood's advice\nto a great extent just then. She had so much to do and so little time to\ndo it in, that it would have been impossible for her to go hunting about\nfor a school for me more in accordance with her own ideas. And she knew\nthat personally Miss Ledbury was well worthy of all respect.\n\nShe went to see her once or twice to talk about me, and make the best\narrangements possible. The first of these visits left a pleasanter\nimpression on her mind than the second. For the first time she saw Miss\nLedbury alone, and found her gentle and sympathising, and full of\nconscientious interest in her pupils, so that it seemed childish to take\nobjection to some of the rules mentioned by the school-mistress which in\nher heart mamma did not approve of.\n\nOne of these was that all the pupils' letters were to be read by one of\nthe teachers, and as to this Miss Ledbury said she could make no\nexception. Then, again, no story-books were permitted, except such as\nwere read aloud on the sewing afternoons. But if I spent my holidays\nthere, as was only too probable, this rule should be relaxed.\n\nThe plan for Sundays, too, struck my mother disagreeably.\n\n\"My poor Geraldine,\" she said to father, when she was telling him all\nabout it, \"I don't know how she will stand such a dreary day.\"\n\nFather suggested that I should be allowed to write my weekly letter to\nthem on Sunday, and mamma said she would see if that could be.\n\nAnd then father begged her not to look at the dark side of things.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, \"Geraldine is very young, and will accommodate\nherself better than you think to her new circumstances. She will enjoy\ncompanions of her own age too. And we know that Miss Ledbury is a good\nand kind woman--the disadvantages seem trifling, though I should not\nlike to think the child was to be there for longer than these two\nyears.\"\n\nMamma gave in to this. Indeed, there seemed nothing else to do. But the\nsecond time she went to see Miss Ledbury, the school-mistress\nintroduced her niece--her \"right hand,\" as she called her--a woman of\nabout forty, named Miss Aspinall, who, though only supposed to be second\nin command, was really the principal authority in the establishment,\nmuch more than poor old Miss Ledbury, whose health was failing, realised\nherself.\n\nMamma did not take to Miss Aspinall. But it was now far too late to make\nany change, and she tried to persuade herself that she was nervously\nfanciful.\n\nAnd here, perhaps, I had better say distinctly, that Miss Aspinall was\nnot a bad or cruel woman. She was, on the contrary, truly conscientious\nand perfectly sincere. But she was wanting in all finer feelings and\ninstincts. She had had a hard and unloving childhood, and had almost\nlost the power of caring much for any one. She loved her aunt after a\nfashion, but she thought her weak. She was just, or wished to be so, and\nwith some of the older pupils she got on fairly well. But she did not\nunderstand children, and took small interest in the younger scholars,\nbeyond seeing that they kept the rules and were not complained of by the\nunder teachers who took charge of them. And as the younger pupils were\nvery seldom boarders it did not very much matter, as they had their own\nhomes and mothers to make them happy once school hours were over.\n\nMamma did not know that there were scarcely any boarders as young as I,\nfor when she first asked about the other pupils, Miss Ledbury, thinking\nprincipally of lessons, said, \"oh yes,\" there was a nice little class\njust about my age, where I should feel quite at home.\n\nA few days before _the_ day--the day of separation for us all--mamma\ntook me to see Miss Ledbury. She thought I would feel rather less\nstrange if I had been there once, and had seen the lady who was to be my\nschool-mistress.\n\nI knew the house--Green Bank, it was called--by sight. It was a little\nfarther out of the town than ours, and had a melancholy bit of garden in\nfront, and a sort of playground at the back. It was not a large\nhouse--indeed, it was not really large enough for the number of people\nliving in it--twenty to thirty boarders, and a number of day-scholars,\nwho of course helped to fill the schoolrooms and to make them hot and\nairless, four resident teachers, and four or five servants. But in those\ndays people did not think nearly as much as now about ventilation and\nlots of fresh air, and perfectly pure water, and all such things, which\nwe now know to be quite as important to our health as food and clothes.\n\nMamma rang the bell. Everything about Green Bank was neat and orderly,\nprim, if not grim. So was the maid-servant who opened the door, and in\nanswer to mamma's inquiry for Miss Ledbury, showed us into the\ndrawing-room, a square moderate-sized-room, at the right hand of the\npassage.\n\nI can remember the look of that room even now, perfectly. It was\npainfully neat, not exactly ugly, for most of the furniture was of the\nspindle-legged quaint kind, to which everybody now gives the general\nname of \"Queen Anne.\" There were a few books set out on the round table,\nthere was a cottage piano at one side, there were some faint\nwater-colours on the wall, and a rather nice clock on the white marble\nmantelpiece, the effect of which was spoilt by a pair of huge \"lustres,\"\nas they were called, at each side of it. The carpet was very ugly, large\nand sprawly in pattern, and so was the hearth-rug. They were the newest\nthings in the room, and greatly admired by Miss Ledbury and her niece,\nwho were full of the bad taste of the day in furniture, and would\ngladly have turned out all the delicate spidery-looking tables and\nchairs to make way for heavy and cumbersome sofas and ottomans, but for\nthe question of expense, and perhaps for the sake of old association on\nthe elder lady's part.\n\nThere was no fire, though it was November, and mamma shivered a little\nas she sat down, possibly, however not altogether from cold. It was\nbetween twelve and one in the morning--that was the hour at which Miss\nLedbury asked parents to call.\n\nAfterwards, when I got to know the rules of the house, I found that the\ndrawing-room fire was never lighted except on Wednesday and Saturday\nafternoons, or on some very special occasion.\n\nI stood beside mamma. Somehow I did not feel inclined to sit down. I was\nfull of a strange kind of excitement, half pleasant, half frightening. I\nthink the second half prevailed as the moments went on. Mamma did not\nspeak, but I felt her hand clasping my shoulder.\n\nThen at last the door opened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. AN UNPROMISING BEGINNING.\n\n\nMy first sight of Miss Ledbury was a sort of agreeable disappointment.\nShe was not the least like what I had imagined, though till I did see\nher I do not think I knew that I had imagined anything! She had been\nmuch less in my thoughts than her pupils; it was the idea of companions,\nthe charm of being one of a party of other girls, with a place of my own\namong them, that my fancy had been full of. I don't think I cared very\nmuch what the teachers were like.\n\nWhat I did see was a very small, fragile-looking old lady, with quite\nwhite hair, a black or purple--I am not sure which, anyway it was\ndark--silk dress, and a soft fawn-coloured cashmere shawl. She had a\nwhite lace cap, tied with ribbons under her chin, and black lace\nmittens. Looking back now, I cannot picture her in any other dress. I\ncannot remember ever seeing her with a bonnet on, and yet she must have\nworn one, as she went to church regularly. Her face was small and still\npretty, and the eyes were naturally sweet, sometimes they had a twinkle\nof humour in them, sometimes they looked almost hard. The truth was that\nshe was a gentle, kind-hearted person by nature, but a narrow life and\neducation had stunted her power of sympathy, and she thought it wrong to\ngive way to feeling. She was conscious of what she believed to be\nweakness in herself, and was always trying to be firm and determined.\nAnd since her niece had come to live with her, this put-on sternness had\nincreased.\n\nYet I was never really afraid of Miss Ledbury, though I never--well,\nperhaps that is rather too strong--almost never, I should say, felt at\nease with her.\n\nI was, I suppose, a very shy child, but till now the circumstances of my\nlife had not brought this out.\n\nThis first time of seeing my future school-mistress I liked her very\nmuch. There was indeed something very attractive about her--something\nalmost \"fairy-godmother-like\" which took my fancy.\n\nWe did not stay long. Miss Ledbury was not without tact, and she saw\nthat the mention of the approaching parting, the settling the day and\nhour at which I was to come to Green Bank to _stay_, were very, very\ntrying to mamma. And I almost think her misunderstanding of me began\nfrom that first interview. In her heart I fancy she was shocked at my\ncoolness, for she did not know, or if she ever had known, she had\nforgotten, much about children--their queer contradictory ways of taking\nthings, how completely they are sometimes the victims of their\nimagination, how little they realise anything they have had no\nexperience of.\n\nAll that the old lady did not understand in me, she put down to my being\nspoilt and selfish. She even, I believe, thought me forward.\n\nStill, she spoke kindly--said she hoped I should soon feel at home at\nGreen Bank, and try to get on well with my lessons, so that when my dear\nmamma returned she would be astonished at the progress I had made.\n\nI did not quite understand what she said--the word \"progress\" puzzled\nme. I wondered if it had anything to do with the pilgrim's progress, and\nI was half inclined to ask if it had, and to tell her that I had read\nthe history of Christian and his family quite through, two or three\ntimes. But mamma had already got up to go, so I only said \"Yes\" rather\nvaguely, and Miss Ledbury kissed me somewhat coldly.\n\nAs soon as we found ourselves outside in the street again, mamma made\nsome little remark. She wanted to find out what kind of impression had\nbeen left on me, though she would not have considered it right to ask me\nstraight out what I thought of the lady who was going to be my\nsuperior--in a sense to fill a parent's place to me.\n\nAnd I remember replying that I thought Miss Ledbury must be very, very\nold--nearly a hundred, I should think.\n\n\"Oh dear no, not nearly as old as that,\" mamma said quickly. \"You must\nnot say anything like that, Geraldine. It would offend her. She cannot\nbe more than sixty.\"\n\nI opened my eyes. I thought it would be very nice to be a hundred.\n\nBut before I had time to say more, my attention was distracted. For just\nat that moment, turning a corner, we almost ran into the procession I\nwas so eager to join--Miss Ledbury's girls, returning two and two from\ntheir morning constitutional.\n\nI felt my cheeks grow red with excitement. I stared at them, and some\nof them, I think, looked at me. Mamma looked at them too, but instead of\ngetting red, her face grew pale.\n\nThey passed so quickly, that I was only able to glance at two or three\nof the twenty or thirty faces. I looked at the smallest of the train\nwith the most interest, though one older face at the very end caught my\nattention almost without my knowing it.\n\nWhen they had passed I turned to mamma.\n\n\"Did you see that little girl with the rosy cheeks, mamma? The one with\na red feather in her hat. _Doesn't_ she look nice?\"\n\n\"She looked a good-humoured little person,\" said mamma. In her heart she\nthought the rosy-faced child rather common-looking and far too showily\ndressed, but that was not unusual among the rich Mexington people, and\nshe would not have said anything like that to me. \"I did notice one\n_very_ sweet face,\" she went on, \"I mean the young lady at the end--one\nof the governesses no doubt.\"\n\nI had, as I said, noticed her too, and mamma's words impressed it upon\nme. Mamma seemed quite cheered by this passing glimpse, and she went on\nspeaking.\n\n\"She must be one of the younger teachers, I should think. I hope you\nmay be in her class. You must tell me if you are when you write to me,\nand tell me her name.\"\n\nI promised I would.\n\nThe next two or three days I have no clear remembrance of at all. They\nseemed all bustle and confusion--though through everything I recollect\nmamma's pale drawn face, and the set look of Haddie's mouth. He was so\ndetermined not to break down. Of father we saw very little--he was\nterribly busy. But when he was at home, he seemed to be always\nwhistling, or humming a tune, or making jokes.\n\n\"How pleased father seems to be about going so far away,\" I said once to\nHaddie. But he did not answer.\n\nHe--Haddie--was to go a part of the way in the same train as father and\nmamma. They were to start on the Thursday, and I was taken to Green Bank\non Wednesday morning. Father took me--and Lydia. I was such a little\ngirl that mamma thought Lydia should go with me to unpack and arrange my\nthings, and she never thought that any one could object to this. For she\nhad never been at school herself, and did not know much about school\nways. I think the first beginning of my troubles and disappointments was\nabout Lydia.\n\nFather and I were shown into the drawing-room. But when the door opened\nthis time, it was not to admit gentle old Miss Ledbury. Instead of her\nin came a tall, thin woman, dressed in gray--she had black hair done\nrather tightly, and a black lace bow on the top of her head.\n\nFather was standing looking out of the window, and I beside him holding\nhis hand. I was not crying. I had had one sudden convulsive fit of sobs\nearly that morning when mamma came for a moment into my room, and for\nthe first time it _really_ came over me that I was leaving her. But she\nalmost prayed me to try not to cry, and the feeling that I was helping\nher, joined to the excitement I was in, made it not so very difficult to\nkeep quiet. I do not even think my eyes were red.\n\nFather turned at the sound of the door opening.\n\n\"Miss Ledbury,\" he began.\n\n\"Not Miss Ledbury. I am Miss Aspinall, her _niece_,\" said the lady; she\nwas not pleased at the mistake.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said poor father. \"I understood----\"\n\n\"Miss Ledbury is not very well this morning,\" said Miss Aspinall. \"She\ndeputed me to express her regrets.\"\n\n\"Oh certainly,\" said father. \"This is my little daughter--you have seen\nher before, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the lady, holding out her hand. \"How do you do, my dear?\"\n\nI did not speak. I stared up at her, I felt so confused and strange. I\nscarcely heard what father went on to say--some simple messages from\nmamma about my writing to them, and so on, and the dates of the mails,\nthe exact address, etc., etc., to all of which Miss Aspinall listened\nwith a slight bend of her head or a stiff \"indeed,\" or \"just so.\"\n\nThis was not encouraging. I am afraid even father's buoyant spirits went\ndown: I think he had had some idea that if he came himself he would be\nable to make friends with my school-mistress and be able to ensure her\nspecial friendliness. But it was clear that nothing of this kind was to\nbe done with the niece.\n\nSo he said at last,\n\n\"Well, I think that is all. Good-bye, my little woman, then. Good-bye,\nmy darling. She will be a good girl, I am sure, Miss Aspinall; she has\nbeen a dear good child at home.\"\n\nHis voice was on the point of breaking, but the governess stood there\nstonily. His praise of me was not the way to win her favour. I do\nbelieve she would have liked me better if he had said I had been so\nnaughty and troublesome at home that he trusted the discipline of school\nwould do me good. And when I glanced up at Miss Aspinall's face,\nsomething seemed to choke down the sob which was beginning again to rise\nin my throat.\n\n[\"GOOD-BYE!\"]\n\n\"Good-bye, my own little girl,\" said father. One more kiss and he was\ngone.\n\nMy luggage was in the hall--which was really a passage scarcely\ndeserving the more important name--and beside it stood Lydia. Miss\nAspinall looked at her coldly.\n\n\"Who----\" she began, when I interrupted her.\n\n\"It's Lydia,\" I said. \"She's come to unpack my things. Mamma sent her.\"\n\n\"Come to unpack your things,\" repeated the governess. \"There must be\nsome mistake--that is quite unnecessary. There is no occasion for you to\nwait,\" she said to poor Lydia, with a slight gesture towards the door.\n\nLydia grew very red.\n\n\"Miss Geraldine won't know about them all, I'm afraid,\" she began. \"She\nhas not been used to taking the charge of her things yet.\"\n\n\"Then the sooner she learns the better,\" said Miss Aspinall, and Lydia\ndared not persist. She turned to me, looking ready to burst out crying\nagain, though, as she had been doing little else for three days, one\nmight have thought her tears were exhausted.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear Miss Geraldine,\" she said, half holding out her arms. I\nflew into them. I was beginning to feel very strange.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear Lydia,\" I said.\n\n\"You will write to me, Miss Geraldine?\"\n\n\"Of course I will; I know your address,\" I said. Lydia was going to her\nown home to work with a dressmaker sister in hopes of coming back to us\nat the end of the two years.\n\n\"Miss Le Marchant\" (I think I have never said that our family name was\nLe Marchant), said a cold voice, \"I really cannot wait any longer; you\nmust come upstairs at once to take off your things.\"\n\nLydia glanced at me.\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" she said; and then she too was gone.\n\nLong afterwards the poor girl told me that her heart was nearly bursting\nwhen she left me, but she had the good sense to say nothing to add to\nmamma's distress, as she knew that my living at Green Bank was all\nsettled about. She could only hope the other governesses might be kinder\nthan the one she had seen.\n\nMiss Aspinall walked upstairs, telling me to follow her. It was not a\nvery large house, but it was a high one and the stairs were steep. It\nseemed to me that I had climbed up a long way when at last she opened a\ndoor half-way down a dark passage.\n\n\"This is your room,\" she said, as she went in.\n\nI followed her eagerly. I don't quite know what I expected. I had not\nbeen told if I was to have a room to myself or not. But at first I think\nI was rather startled to see three beds in a room not much larger than\nmy own one at home--three beds and two wash-hand stands, a large and a\nsmall, two chests of drawers, a large and a small also, which were\nevidently considered to be toilet-tables as well, as each had a\nlooking-glass, and three chairs.\n\nMy eyes wandered round. It was all quite neat, though dull. For the one\nwindow looked on to the side-wall of the next-door house, and much\nlight could not have got in at the best of times, added to which, the\nday was a very gray one. But the impression it made upon me was more\nthat of a tidy and clean servants' room than of one for ladies, even\nthough only little girls.\n\nI stood still and silent.\n\n\"This is your bed,\" said Miss Aspinall next, touching a small white\ncounterpaned iron bedstead in one corner--I was glad it was in a corner.\n\"The Miss Smiths are your companions. They share the large chest of\ndrawers, and your things will go into the smaller one.\"\n\n\"There won't be nearly room enough,\" I said quickly. I had yet to learn\nthe habit of not saying out whatever came into my head.\n\n\"Nonsense, child,\" said the governess. \"There must be room enough for\nyou if there is room enough for much older and----\" she stopped. \"At\nyour age many clothes are not requisite. I think, on the whole, it will\nbe better for you not to unpack or arrange your own things. One of the\ngovernesses shall do so, and all that you do not actually require must\nstay in your trunk and be put in the box-room.\"\n\nI did not pay very much attention to what she said. I don't think I\nclearly understood it, for, as I have said, in some ways I was rather a\nslow child. And my thoughts were running more on the Miss Smiths and the\nrest of my future companions than on my wardrobe. If I had taken in that\nit was not only my clothes that were in question, but that my little\nhousehold gods, my special pet possessions, were not to be left in my\nown keeping, I would have minded much more.\n\n\"Now take off your things at once,\" said Miss Aspinall. \"You must keep\non your boots till your shoes are got out, but take care not to stump\nalong the passages. Do your hands want washing? No, you have your gloves\non. As soon as you are ready, go down two flights of stairs till you\ncome to the passage under this on the next floor. The door at the end is\nthe second class schoolroom, where you will be shown your place.\"\n\nThen she went away, leaving me to my own reflections. Not a word of\nsympathy or encouragement, not a pat on my shoulder as she passed me,\nnor a kindly glance out of her hard eyes. But at the time I scarcely\nnoticed this. My mind was still full of not unpleasant excitement,\nthough I was beginning to feel tired and certainly very confused and\nbewildered.\n\nI sat down for a moment on the edge of my little bed when Miss Aspinall\nleft me, without hastening to take off my coat and bonnet. We wore\nbonnets mostly in those days, though hats were beginning to come into\nfashion for young girls.\n\n\"I wish there were only two beds, not three,\" I said to myself. \"And I\nwould like the little girl with the rosy face to sleep in my room. I\nwonder if she's Miss Smith perhaps. I wonder if there's several little\ngirls as little as me. I'd like to know all their names, so as to write\nand tell them to mamma and Haddie.\"\n\nThe inclination to cry had left me--fortunately in some ways, though\nperhaps if I had made my _début_ in the schoolroom looking very\nwoe-begone and tearful I should have made a better impression. My future\ncompanions would have felt sorry for me. As it was, when I had taken off\nmy things I made my way downstairs as I had been directed, and opening\nthe schoolroom door--I remember wondering to myself what second class\nschoolroom could mean: would it have long seats all round, something\nlike a second-class railway carriage?--walked in coolly enough.\n\nThe room felt airless and close, though it was a cold day. And at the\nfirst glance it seemed to me perfectly full of people--girls--women\nindeed in my eyes many of them were, they were so much bigger and older\nthan I--in every direction, more than I could count. And the hum of\nvoices was very confusing, the _hums_ I should say, for there were two\nor three different sets of reading aloud, or lessons repeating, going on\nat once.\n\nI stood just inside the door. Two or three heads were turned in my\ndirection at the sound I made in opening it, but quickly bent over their\nbooks again, and for some moments no one paid any attention to me. Then\nsuddenly a governess happened to catch sight of me. It was the same\nsweet-faced girl whom mamma had noticed at the end of the long file in\nthe street.\n\nShe looked at me once, then seemed at a loss, then she looked at me\nagain, and at last said something to the girl beside her, and getting up\nfrom her seat went to the end of the room, and spoke to a small elderly\nwoman in a brown stuff dress, who was evidently another governess.\n\nThis person--I suppose I should say lady--turned round and stared at me.\nThen she said something to the younger governess, nothing very pleasant,\nI fancy, for the sweet-looking one--I had better call her by her name,\nwhich was Miss Fenmore--went back to her place with a heightened colour.\n\nYou may ask how I can remember all these little particulars so exactly.\nPerhaps I do not quite do so, but still, all that happened just then\nmade a very strong impression on me, and I have thought it over so much\nand so often, especially since I have had children of my own, that it is\ndifficult to tell quite precisely how much is real memory, how much the\nafter knowledge of how things must have been, to influence myself and\nothers as they did. And later, too, I talked them over with those who\nwere older than I at the time, and could understand more.\n\nSo there I stood, a very perplexed little person, though still more\nperplexed than distressed or disappointed, by the door. Now and then\nsome head was turned to look at me with a sort of stealthy curiosity,\nbut there was no kindness in any of the glances, and the young governess\nkept her eyes turned away. I was not a pretty child. My hair was\nstraight and not noticeable in any way, and it was tightly plaited, as\nwas the fashion, _unless_ a child's hair was thick enough to make pretty\nringlets. My face was rather thin and pale, and there was nothing of\ndimpling childish loveliness about me. I was rather near-sighted too,\nand I daresay that often gave me a worried, perhaps a fretful\nexpression.\n\nAfter all, I did not have to wait very long. The elderly governess\nfinished the page she was reading aloud--she may have been dictating to\nher pupils, I cannot say--and came towards me.\n\n\"Did Miss Aspinall send you here?\" she said abruptly.\n\nI looked up at her. She seemed to me no better than our cook, and not\nhalf so good-natured.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she repeated, as if she was very shocked. \"Yes _who_, if you\nplease? Yes, Miss ----?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss,\" I said in a matter-of-fact way.\n\n\"What manners! Fie!\" said Miss ----; afterwards I found her name was\nBroom. \"I think indeed it was quite time for you to come to school. If\nyou cannot say my name, you can at least say ma'am.\"\n\nI stared up at her. I think my trick of staring must have been rather\nprovoking, and perhaps even must have seemed rude, though it arose\nentirely from my not understanding.\n\n\"I don't know your name, Miss--ma'am,\" I said. I spoke clearly. I was\nnot frightened. And a titter went round the forms. Miss Broom was angry\nat being put in the wrong.\n\n\"Miss Aspinall sent you to my class, _Miss Broom's_ class,\" she said.\n\n\"No, ma'am--Miss Broom--she didn't.\"\n\nThe governess thought I meant to be impertinent--impertinent, poor me!\n\nAnd with no very gentle hand, she half led, half pushed me towards her\nend of the room, where there was a vacant place on one of the forms.\n\n\"Silence, young ladies,\" she said, for some whispering was taking place.\n\"Go on with your copying out.\"\n\nAnd then she turned to me with a book.\n\n\"Let me hear how you can read,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. A NEW WORLD.\n\n\nI could read aloud well, unusually well, I think, for mamma had taken\ngreat pains with my pronunciation. She was especially anxious that both\nHaddie and I should speak well, and not catch the Great Mexington\naccent, which was both peculiar and ugly.\n\nBut the book which Miss Broom had put before me was hardly a fair test.\nI don't remember what it was--some very dry history, I think, bristling\nwith long words, and in very small print. I did not take in the sense of\nwhat I was reading in the very least, and so, of course, I read badly,\ntumbling over the long words, and putting no intelligence into my tone.\nI think, too, my teacher was annoyed at the purity of my accent, for no\none could possibly have mistaken _her_ for anything but what she was--a\nnative of Middleshire. She corrected me once or twice, then shut the\nbook impatiently.\n\n\"Very bad,\" she said, \"very bad indeed for eleven years old.\"\n\n\"I am not eleven, Miss Broom,\" I said. \"I am only nine past.\"\n\n[\"LITTLE GIRLS MUST NOT CONTRADICT, AND MUST NOT BE\nRUDE.\"]\n\n\"Little girls must not contradict, and must not be rude,\" was the reply.\n\nWhat had I said that could be called rude? I tried to think, thereby\nbringing on myself a reprimand for inattention, which did not have the\neffect of brightening my wits, I fear.\n\nI think I was put through a sort of examination as to all my\nacquirements. I know I came out of it very badly, for Miss Broom\npronounced me so backward that there was no class, not even the\nyoungest, in the school, which I was really fit for. There was nothing\nfor it, however, but to put me into this lowest class, and she said I\nmust do extra work in play hours to make up to my companions.\n\nEven my French, which I now _know_ must have been good, was found fault\nwith by Miss Broom, who said my accent was extraordinary. And certainly,\nif hers was Parisian, mine must have been worse than that of\nStratford-le-Bow!\n\nStill, I was not unhappy. I thought it must be always like that at\nschool, and I said to myself I really would work hard to make up to\nthe others, who were so much, much cleverer than I. And I sat\ncontentedly enough in my place, doing my best to learn a page of English\ngrammar by heart, from time to time peeping round the table, till, to my\ngreat satisfaction and delight, I caught sight of the rosy-cheeked\ndamsel at the farther end of the table.\n\nI was so pleased that I wonder I did not jump up from my place and run\nround to speak to her, forgetful that though I had thought so much of\nher, she had probably never noticed me at all the only other time of our\nmeeting, or rather passing each other.\n\nBut I felt Miss Broom's eye upon me, and sat still. I acquitted myself\npretty fairly of my page of grammar, leading to the dry remark from the\ngoverness that it was plain I \"could learn if I chose.\" As this was the\nfirst thing I had been given to learn, the implied reproach was not\nexactly called for. But none of Miss Broom's speeches were remarkable\nfor being appropriate. They depended much more on the mood she happened\nto be in herself than upon anything else.\n\nI can clearly remember most of that day. I have a vision of a long\ndining-table, long at least it seemed to me, and a plateful of roast\nmutton and potatoes which I could not manage to finish, followed by rice\npudding with which I succeeded better, though I was not the least\nhungry. Miss Aspinall was at one end of the table, Miss Broom at the\nother, and Miss Fenmore, who seemed always to be jumping up to ring the\nbell or hand the governesses something or other that had been forgotten\nby the servant, sat somewhere in the middle.\n\nNo one spoke unless spoken to by one of the teachers. Miss Aspinall shot\nout little remarks from time to time about the weather, and replied\ngraciously enough to one or two of the older girls who ventured to ask\nif Miss Ledbury's cold, or headache, was better.\n\nThen came the grace, followed by a shoving back of forms, and a march in\norder of age, or place in class rather, to the door, and thence down the\npassage to what was called the big schoolroom--a room on the ground\nfloor, placed where by rights the kitchen should have been, I fancy. It\nwas the only large room in the house, and I think it must have been\nbuilt out beyond the original walls on purpose.\n\nAnd then--there re-echo on my ears even now the sudden bursting out of\nnoise, the loosening of a score and a half of tongues, girls' tongues\ntoo, forcibly restrained since the morning. For this was the recreation\nhour, and on a wet day, to make up for not going a walk, the \"young\nladies\" were allowed from two to three to chatter as much as they\nliked--in English instead of in the fearful and wonderful jargon yclept\n\"French.\"\n\nI stood in a corner by myself, staring, no doubt. I felt profoundly\ninterested. This was a _little_ more like what I had pictured to myself,\nthough I had not imagined it would be quite so noisy and bewildering.\nBut some of the girls seemed very merry, and their laughter and chatter\nfascinated me--if only I were one of them, able to laugh and chatter\ntoo! Should I ever be admitted to share their fun?\n\nThe elder girls did not interest me. They seemed to me quite grown-up.\nYet it was from their ranks that came the first token of interest in\nme--of notice that I was there at all.\n\n\"What's your name?\" said a tall thin girl with fair curls, which one\ncould see she was very proud of. She was considered a beauty in the\nschool. She was silly, but very good-natured. She spoke with a sort of\nlisp, and very slowly, so her question did not strike me as rude. Nor\nwas it meant to be so. It was a mixture of curiosity and amiability.\n\n\"My name,\" I repeated, rather stupidly. I was startled by being spoken\nto.\n\n\"Yes, your name. Didn't Miss Lardner say what's your name? Dear\nme--don't stand gaping there like a monkey on a barrel-organ,\" said\nanother girl.\n\nBy this time a little group had gathered round me. The girls composing\nit all laughed, and though it does not sound very witty--to begin with,\nI never heard of a monkey \"gaping\"--I have often thought since that\nthere was some excuse for the laughter. I was small and thin, and I had\na trick of screwing up my eyes which made them look smaller than they\nreally were. And my frock was crimson merino with several rows of black\nvelvet above the hem of the skirt.\n\nI was not offended. But I did not laugh. The girl who had spoken last\nwas something of a tomboy, and looked upon also as a wit. Her name was\nJosephine Mellor, and her intimate friends called her Joe. She had very\nfuzzy red hair, and rather good brown eyes.\n\n\"I say,\" she went on again, \"what _is_ your name? And are you going to\nstay to dinner every day, or only when it rains, like Lizzie Burt?\"\n\nWho was Lizzie Burt? That question nearly set my ideas adrift again. But\nthe consciousness of my superior position fortunately kept me to the\npoint.\n\n\"I am going to be at dinner always,\" I said proudly. \"I am a boarder.\"\n\nThe girls drew a little nearer, with evidently increased interest.\n\n\"A boarder,\" repeated Josephine. \"Then Harriet Smith'll have to give up\nbeing baby. You're ever so much younger than her, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"What are you saying about me?\" said Harriet, who had caught the sound\nof her own name, as one often does.\n\n\"Only that that pretty snub nose of yours is going to be put out of\njoint,\" said Miss Mellor mischievously.\n\nHarriet came rushing forward. She was my rosy-cheeked girl! Her face was\nredder than usual. I felt very vexed with Miss Mellor, even though I did\nnot quite understand her.\n\n\"What are you saying?\" the child called out. \"I'm not going to have any\nof your teasing, Joe.\"\n\n\"It's not teasing--it's truth,\" said the elder girl. \"You're not the\nbaby any more. _She_,\" and she pointed to me, \"she's younger than you.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\" said Harriet roughly.\n\n\"Nine past,\" I said. \"Nine and a half.\"\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" shouted Harriet. \"I'm only nine and a month. I'm still\nthe baby, Miss Joe.\"\n\nShe was half a head at least taller than I, and broad in proportion.\n\n\"What a mite you are, to be sure,\" said Miss Mellor, \"nine and a half\nand no bigger than that.\"\n\nI felt myself getting red. I think one or two of the girls must have had\nperception enough to feel a little sorry for me, for one of them--I\nfancy it was Miss Lardner--said in a good-natured patronising way,\n\n\"You haven't told us your name yet, after all.\"\n\n\"It's Geraldine,\" I said. \"That's my first name, and I'm always called\nit.\"\n\n\"Geraldine what?\" said the red-haired girl.\n\n\"Geraldine Theresa Le Marchant--that's all my names.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" said Miss Mellor, \"how grand we are! Great Mexington's\ngrowing quite aristocratic. I didn't know monkeys had such fine names.\"\n\nSome of the girls laughed, some, I think, thought her as silly as she\nwas.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\" was the next question.\n\n\"Come from?\" I repeated. \"I don't know.\"\n\nAt this they all did laugh, and I suppose it was only natural. Suddenly\nHarriet Smith made a sort of dash at me.\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" she exclaimed. \"I know. She's going to sleep in our room. I\nsaw them putting sheets on the bed in the corner, but Jane wouldn't tell\nme who they were for. Emma,\" she called out loudly to a girl of fourteen\nor fifteen, \"Emma, I say, she's going to sleep in our room I'm sure.\"\n\nEmma Smith was taller and thinner and paler than her sister, but still\nthey were rather like. Perhaps it was for that very reason that they got\non so badly--they might have been better friends if they had been more\nunlike. As it was, they quarrelled constantly, and I must say it was\ngenerally Harriet's fault. She was very spoilt, but she had something\nhearty and merry about her, and so had Emma. They were the daughters of\na rich Great Mexington manufacturer, and they had no mother. They were\nfavourites in the school, partly I suspect because they had lots of\npocket money, and used to invite their companions to parties in the\nholidays. But they were not mean or insincere, though rough and\nnoisy--more like boys than girls.\n\nEmma came bouncing forward.\n\n\"I say,\" she began to me, \"if it's true you're to sleep in our room I\nhope you understand you must do what I tell you. I'm the eldest. You're\nnot to back up Harriet to disobey me.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I don't want to do anything like that.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Harriet, \"you'll be Emma's friend, not mine.\"\n\nMy face fell, and I suppose Harriet saw it. She came closer to me and\nlooked at me well, as if expecting me to answer. But for the first time\nsince I had been in my new surroundings I felt more than bewildered--I\nfelt frightened and lonely, terribly lonely.\n\n\"Oh, mamma,\" I thought to myself, \"I wish I could see you to tell you\nabout it. It isn't a bit like what I thought it would be.\"\n\nBut I said nothing aloud. I think now that if I had burst out crying it\nwould have been better for me, but I had very little power of expressing\nmyself, and Haddie had instilled into me a great horror of being a\ncry-baby at school.\n\nIn their rough way, however, several of the girls were kind-hearted, the\ntwo Smiths perhaps as much so as any. Harriet came close up to me.\n\n\"I'm only in fun,\" she said; \"of course we'll be friends. I'll tell you\nhow we'll do,\" and she put her fat little arm round me in a protecting\nway which I much appreciated. \"Come over here,\" she went on in a lower\nvoice, \"where none of the big ones can hear what we say,\" and she drew\nme, nothing loth, to the opposite corner of the room.\n\nAs we passed through the group of older girls standing about, one or two\nfragments of their talk reached my ears.\n\n\"Yes--I'm sure it's the same. He's a bank clerk, I think. I've heard\npapa speak of them. They're awfully poor--come-down-in-the-world sort of\npeople.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, I expect when she's old enough she'll be a governess--perhaps\nshe'll be a sort of teacher here to begin with.\"\n\nThen followed some remark about looking far ahead, and a laugh at the\nidea of \"the monkey\" ever developing into a governess.\n\nBut after my usual fashion it was not till I thought it over afterwards\nthat I understood that it was I and my father they had been discussing.\nIn the meantime I was enjoying a confidential talk with Harriet\nSmith--that is to say, I was listening to all she said to me; she did\nnot seem to expect me to say much in reply.\n\nI felt flattered by her condescension, but I did not in my heart feel\nmuch interest in her communications. They were mostly about Emma--how\nshe tried to bully her, Harriet, because she herself was five years\nolder, and how the younger girl did not intend to stand it much longer.\nEmma was as bad as a boy.\n\n\"As bad as a boy,\" I repeated. \"I don't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"That's because you've not got a brother, I suppose,\" said Harriet. \"Our\nbrother's a perfect nuisance. He's so spoilt--papa lets him do just as\nhe likes. Emma and I hate the holidays because of him being at home. But\nit's the worst for me, you see. Emma hates Fred bullying her, so she\nmight know I hate her bullying me.\"\n\nThis was all very astonishing to me.\n\n\"I have a brother,\" I said after a moment or two's reflection.\n\n\"Then you know what it is. Why didn't you say so?\" asked Harriet.\n\n\"Because I don't know what it is. Haddie never teases me. I love being\nwith him.\"\n\n\"My goodness! Then you're not like most,\" said Harriet elegantly,\nopening her eyes.\n\nShe asked me some questions after this--as to where we lived, how many\nservants we had, and so on. Some I answered--some I could not, as I was\nby no means as worldly-wise as this precocious young person.\n\nShe gave me a great deal of information about school--she hated the\ngovernesses, except the old lady, and she didn't care about her much.\nMiss Broom was her special dislike. But she liked school very well,\nshe'd been there a year now, and before that she had a daily governess\nat home, and it was very dull indeed. What had I done till now--had I\nhad a governess?\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said. \"I had mamma.\"\n\n\"Was she good to you,\" asked my new friend, \"or was she very strict?\"\n\nI stared at Harriet. Mamma was strict, but she was very, very good to\nme. I said so.\n\n\"Then why are you a boarder?\" she asked. \"_We_'ve not got a mamma, but\neven if we had I'm sure she wouldn't teach us herself. I suppose your\nmamma isn't rich enough to pay for a governess for you.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said simply. I had never thought in this way of\nmamma's teaching me, but I was not at all offended. \"I don't think any\ngoverness would be as nice as mamma.\"\n\n\"Then why have you come to school?\" inquired Harriet.\n\n\"Because\"--\"because father and mamma have to go away,\" I was going to\nsay, when suddenly the full meaning of the words seemed to rush over me.\nA strange giddy feeling made me shut my eyes and I caught hold of\nHarriet's arm.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she said wonderingly, as I opened my eyes and\nlooked at her again.\n\n\"I'd rather not talk about mamma just now,\" I said. \"I'll tell you\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Up in our room,\" said Harriet, \"oh yes, that'll be jolly. We've got all\nsorts of dodges.\"\n\nBut before she had time to explain more, or I to ask her why \"dodges\"--I\nknew the meaning of the word from Haddie--were required, a bell rang\nloudly.\n\nInstantly the hubbub ceased, and there began a sort of silent\nscramble--the elder girls collecting books and papers and hurrying to\ntheir places; the younger ones rushing upstairs to the other schoolroom,\nI following.\n\nIn a few minutes we were all seated round the long tables. It was a\nsewing afternoon, and to my great delight I saw that Miss Fenmore, the\npretty governess whom I had taken such a fancy to, though I had not yet\nspoken to her, was now in Miss Broom's place.\n\nMamma had provided me with both plain work and a little simple fancy\nwork, but as my things were not yet unpacked, I had neither with me, and\nI sat feeling awkward and ashamed, seeing all the others busily\npreparing for business.\n\n\"Have you no work, my dear?\" said Miss Fenmore gently. It was the first\nkind speech I had had from a governess.\n\n\"It isn't unpacked,\" I said, feeling my cheeks grow red, I did not know\nwhy.\n\nMiss Fenmore hesitated for a moment. Then she took out a stocking--or\nrather the beginning of one on knitting-needles.\n\n\"Can you knit?\" she asked.\n\n\"I can knit plain--plain and purl--just straight on,\" I said. \"But I've\nnever done it round like that.\"\n\n\"Never mind, you will learn easily, as you know how to knit. Come and\nsit beside me, so that I can watch you.\"\n\nShe made the girls sit a little more closely, making a place for me\nbeside her, and I would have been quite happy had I not seen a cross\nexpression on several faces, and heard murmurs of \"favouring,\" \"spoilt\npet,\" and so on.\n\nMiss Fenmore, if _she_ heard, took no notice. And in a few moments all\nwas in order. We read aloud in turns--the book was supposed to be a\nstory-book, but it seemed to me very dull, though the fault may have\nlain in the uninteresting way the girls read, and the constant change of\nvoices, as no one read more than two pages at a time. I left off trying\nto listen and gave my whole attention to my knitting, encouraged by Miss\nFenmore's whispered \"very nice--a little looser,\" or \"won't it be nice\nto knit socks for your father or brother, if you have a brother?\"\n\nI nodded with a smile. I was burning to tell her everything. Already I\nfelt that I loved her dearly--her voice was as sweet as her face. Yet\nthere were tones in the former and lines in the latter telling of much\nsorrow and suffering, young as she was. I was far too much of a child to\nunderstand this. I only felt vaguely that there was something about her\nwhich reminded me of mamma as she had looked these last few weeks.\n\nAnd my heart was won.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. GATHERING CLOUDS.\n\n\nAfter that first day at Green Bank, the remembrance of things in detail\nis not so clear to me.\n\nTo begin with, the life was very monotonous. Except for the different\nlessons, one day passed much like another, the principal variety being\nthe coming of Sunday and the two weekly half-holidays--Wednesday and\nSaturday. But to me the half-holidays brought no pleasure. I think I\ndisliked them more than lesson days, and most certainly I disliked\nSundays most of all.\n\nLooking back now, I think my whole nature and character must have gone\nthrough some curious changes in these first weeks at school. I grew\nolder very rapidly.\n\nThere first came by degrees the great _disappointment_ of it all--for\nthough I am anxious not to exaggerate anything, it was a bewildering\n\"disillusionment\" to me. Nobody and nothing were what I had imagined\nthey would be. Straight out of my sheltered home, where every thought\nand tone and word were full of love, I was tossed into this world of\nschool, where, though no doubt there were kind hearts and nice natures\nas there are everywhere, the whole feeling was different. Even the\ngood-nature was rough and unrefined--the tones of voice, the ways of\nmoving about, the readiness to squabble, though very likely it was more\na kind of bluster than anything worse, all startled and astounded me, as\nI gradually awoke from my dream of the delights of being at school\nsurrounded by companions.\n\nAnd there was really a prejudice against me, both among teachers and\npupils. A story had got about that my family was very, very poor, that\nfather had had to go abroad on this account, and that my schooling was\nto be paid for out of charity. So even my gentleness, my soft way of\nspeaking, the surprise I was too innocent to conceal at much that I saw,\nwere all put down to my \"giving myself airs.\" And I daresay the very\nefforts I made to please those about me and to gain their affection did\nmore harm than good. Because I clung more or less to Harriet Smith, my\nroom-mate, and the nearest to me in age, I was called a little sneak,\ntrying to get all I could \"out of her,\" as she was such a rich little\ngirl.\n\nI overheard these remarks once or twice, but it was not for some time\nthat I in the least knew what they meant, and so I daresay the\ncoarse-minded girls who made them thought all the worse of me because I\ndid not resent them and just went quietly on my own way.\n\nWhat I did want from Harriet was sympathy; and when she was in the\nhumour to pay attention to me, she did give me as much as it was in her\nto give.\n\nI shall never forget the real kindness she and Emma too showed me that\nfirst night at Green Bank, when a great blow fell on me after we went\nupstairs to go to bed.\n\nSome one had unpacked my things. My night-dress was lying on the bed, my\nbrushes and sponges were in their places, and when I opened the very\nsmall chest of drawers I saw familiar things neatly arranged in them.\nBut there seemed so few--and in the bottom drawer only one frock, and\nthat my oldest one, not the pretty new one mamma had got me for Sundays\nor any special occasion.\n\n\"Where can all my other things be?\" I said to Harriet, who was greatly\ninterested in my possessions.\n\n\"What more have you?\" she said, peering over my shoulder.\n\nI named several.\n\n\"And all my other things,\" I went on, \"not clothes, I don't mean, but my\nworkbox and my new writing-desk, and the picture of father and mamma and\nHaddie\"--it was before the days of \"carte-de-visite\" or \"cabinet\"\nphotographs; this picture was what was called a \"daguerreotype\" on\nglass, and had been taken on purpose for me at some expense--\"and my\nchina dog and the rabbits, and my scraps of silk, and all my puzzles,\nand, and----\" I stopped short, out of breath with bewilderment. \"Can\nthey be all together for me to unpack myself?\" I said.\n\nEmma, the most experienced of the three, shook her head.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" she was beginning, when the door opened, and Miss Broom's\nface appeared.\n\n\"Young ladies,\" she said, \"I cannot have this. No talking after the last\nbell has rung. My dear Miss Smith, you are not usually so forgetful. If\nit is _you_, Miss Marchant, it is a very bad beginning, disobedience the\nvery first evening.\"\n\n\"She didn't know,\" said both the girls. \"It isn't her fault.\" \"And if\nshe had known,\" Harriet went on, \"she couldn't have helped it. Miss\nBroom, somebody's took such lots of her things. Tell her, Gerry.\"\n\nUnder her protection I repeated the list of missing articles, but before\nI had got to the end the governess interrupted me.\n\n\"You are a most impertinent child,\" she said, \"to say such a thing.\nThere are no thieves at Green Bank--what a mind you must have! Your\nthings are safely packed away. Such as you really need you shall have\nfrom time to time as I or Miss Aspinall think fit. The frock you have on\nmust be kept as your best one, and you must wear the brown check every\nday. You have far too many clothes--absurd extravagance--no wonder----\"\nbut here she had the sense to stop short.\n\nI did not care so much about my clothes.\n\n\"It's the other things I mind,\" I began, but Miss Broom, who was already\nat the door, again interrupted.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she said. \"We cannot have the rooms littered with rubbish.\nMiss Aspinall left it to me. You may have your Biblical dissected maps\non Sundays, and perhaps some of the other puzzles during the Christmas\nholidays, but young ladies do not come to school to amuse themselves,\nbut to work hard at their lessons.\"\n\nI dared not say anything more. There may have been some reason in\nputting away a certain number of my treasures, for dear mamma, in her\nwish to do all she possibly could for my happiness, had very probably\nsent more things with me than was advisable. But I was not a silly\nspoilt child; I had always been taught to be reasonable, and I would\nhave given in quite cheerfully if Miss Broom had put it before me in any\nkindly way.\n\nI was not left quite without defence, however.\n\n\"I don't see but what you might let her have some things out,\" said\nEmma. \"Harry and I have. Look at the mantelpiece--the china figures and\nthe Swiss châlets are our ornaments, and there's quite room for some\nmore.\"\n\nBut Miss Broom was by this time at the door, which shut after her\nsharply without her saying another word.\n\n\"Horrid old cat,\" said both the Smiths.\n\nI said nothing, for if I had I knew I should have burst into tears. But\nafter I was ready for bed and had said my prayers, I could not help the\none bitter complaint.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind anything else if only she'd let me have papa and\nmamma's picture,\" I said.\n\n\"_Of course_ you should have that,\" said Emma. \"I'm sure Miss Ledbury\nwould let you have it. I think even Miss Aspinall would. Don't be\nunhappy, Gerry, I'll see if I can't do something for you to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd with this consolation I fell asleep. Nor did Emma forget her\npromise. The next day I found my daguerreotype installed on the\nmantelpiece, where it stayed all the time I was at school.\n\nMy happiest days were those of our French lessons, for then Miss Fenmore\nwas the teacher. She spoke French very well, and she was most kind and\npatient. Yet for some reason or other she was not much liked in the\nschool. There was a prejudice against her as there was against me:\npartly, because she did not belong to that part of the country, she was\nsaid to \"give herself airs\"; partly, I think, because she was quiet and\nrather reserved; partly, I am afraid, because some of the elder girls\nwere jealous of her extreme loveliness. She was as kind to me as she\ndared to be, but I had no lessons from her except French, and she has\nsince told me that she did not venture to show me anything like\npartiality, as it would only have made my life still harder and\nlonelier.\n\nThe remembrances which stand out the most clearly in my mind will give a\nfair idea of my time at Green Bank. The next great trouble I had came on\nmy first Sunday there.\n\nIt had been settled that I was to write to mamma once a week--by every\nmail, that is to say. The usual day for writing home was Wednesday, the\nhalf-holiday, but as the South American mail left England that very day,\nmamma had arranged with Miss Ledbury that I should be allowed to add a\nlittle on Sundays to my letter, as otherwise my news would be a whole\nweek late before it left.\n\nSo on the first Sunday afternoon I got out my writing things with great\nsatisfaction, and when Miss Broom asked me what I was going to do, I was\npleased to be able to reply that Miss Ledbury had given leave for a\nSunday letter. Miss Broom said something to Miss Aspinall, but though\nthey both looked very disapproving, they said no more.\n\nI wrote a long letter. This time, of course, it had to be a complete\none, as I had only come to Green Bank on the Thursday. I poured out my\nheart to mamma, but yet, looking back now and recalling, as I know I\ncan, pretty correctly, all I said, I do not think it was exaggerated or\nwrong. I tried to write cheerfully, for childish as I was in many ways,\nI did understand that it would make mamma miserable to think I was\nunhappy.\n\nI was just closing the envelope when Miss Broom entered the room.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she said. \"Dear, dear, you don't mean to say you\nhave been all this afternoon writing that letter? What a waste of time!\nNo, no, you must not do that. Miss Ledbury will seal it.\"\n\n\"It doesn't need sealing,\" I replied. \"It is a gumming-down envelope.\"\n\nBut she had come close to me, and drew it out of my hand.\n\n\"No letters leave this house without being first read by Miss Ledbury or\nMiss Aspinall,\" she said. \"Why do you stare so? It is the rule at every\nschool,\" and so in those days I suppose it was. \"If you have written\nnothing you should not, you have no reason to dread its being seen.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" I replied indignantly. Even the three or four days I had\nbeen at school had made me months older. \"I have,\" I repeated. \"Nobody\nwould say to strangers all they'd say to their own mamma.\"\n\nI felt my face growing very red; I pulled the letter out of the envelope\nand began to tear it across. But Miss Broom's strong hands caught hold\nof mine.\n\n\"You are a very naughty girl,\" she said, \"a very naughty girl indeed. I\nsaw at once how spoilt and self-willed you were, but I never could have\nbelieved you would dare to give way to such violent temper.\"\n\nShe dragged the letter out of my fingers--indeed, I was too proud to\nstruggle with her--and left the room. I sat there in a sort of stupefied\nindifference. That day had been the worst I had had. There was not the\ninterest of lessons, nor the daily bustle which had always something\nenlivening about it. It was so dull, and oh, so different from home! The\nhome-sickness which I was too ignorant to give a name to began to come\nover me with strides; but for my letter to mamma I felt as if I could\nnot have lived through that afternoon. For even the Smiths were away.\nThey were what was called \"weekly boarders,\" going home every Saturday\nat noon and staying till Monday morning.\n\nThe indifference did not last long. Gradually both it and the\nindignation broke down. I laid my head on the table before me and burst\ninto convulsive crying.\n\nI do not think I cried loudly. I only remember the terrible sort of\nshaking that went through me--I had never felt anything like it in my\nlife--and I remember trying to choke down my sobs for fear of Miss Broom\nhearing me and coming back.\n\n[\"MY POOR LITTLE GIRL, WHAT _IS_ THE MATTER?\"]\n\nSome one opened the door and looked in. I tried to be perfectly quiet.\nBut the some one, whoever it was, had seen and perhaps heard me, for she\ncame forward, and in another moment I felt an arm steal gently round me,\nwhile a kind voice said softly, very softly,\n\n\"My poor little girl, what _is_ the matter?\" and looking up, I saw that\nthe new-comer was Miss Fenmore.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said through my tears, \"it's my letter, and she's taken it\naway--that horrid, _horrid_ Miss Broom.\"\n\nAnd I told her the whole story.\n\nMiss Fenmore was very wise as well as kind. I have often wondered how\nshe had learnt so much self-control in her short life, for though she\nthen seemed quite \"old\" to me, I now know she cannot have been more than\neighteen or nineteen. But she had had a sad life--that of an orphan\nsince childhood. I suppose sorrow had done the work of years in her\ncase--work that is indeed often not done at all! For she had a character\nwhich was good soil for all discipline. She was naturally so sweet and\njoyous--she seemed born with rose-coloured spectacles.\n\n\"Dear child,\" she said, \"try not to take this so much to heart. I\ndaresay your letter will be sent just as it is. Miss Broom is sure to\napply to Miss Aspinall, perhaps to Miss Ledbury. And Miss Ledbury is\nreally kind, and she must have had great experience in such things.\"\n\nBut the last words were spoken with more hesitation. Miss Fenmore knew\nthat the class of children composing Miss Ledbury's school had not had a\nhome like mine.\n\nSuddenly she started up--steps were coming along the passage.\n\n\"I must not talk to you any more just now,\" she said, \"I came to fetch a\nbook.\"\n\nAfter all, the steps did not come to the schoolroom. So after sitting\nthere a little longer, somewhat comforted by the young governess's\nwords, I went up to my own room, where I bathed my eyes and smoothed my\nhair, mindful of Haddie's warning--not to get the name of a cry-baby!\n\nLate that evening, after tea, I was sent for to Miss Ledbury in the\ndrawing-room. It was a very rainy night, so only a few of the elder\ngirls had gone to church. Miss Ledbury herself suffered sadly from\nasthma, and could never go out in bad weather. This was the first time I\nhad seen her to speak to since I came.\n\nI was still too unhappy to feel very frightened, and I was not naturally\nshy, though I seemed so, owing to my difficulty in expressing myself.\nAnd there was something about the old lady's manner, gentle though she\nwas, which added to my constraint. I have no doubt she found me very\ndull and stupid, and it must have been disappointing, for she did mean\nto be kind.\n\nShe spoke to me about my letter which she had read, according to her\nrule, to which she said she could make no exceptions. I did not clearly\nunderstand what she meant, so I just replied \"No, ma'am,\" and \"Yes,\nma'am.\" She said the letter should be sent as it was, but she gave me\nadvice for the future which in some ways was very good. Could I not\ncontent myself with writing about my own affairs--my lessons, the books\nI was reading, and so on? What was the use of telling mamma that I did\nnot like Miss Aspinall, and that I could not bear Miss Broom? Would it\nplease mamma, or would it make school-life any happier for me to take up\nsuch prejudices? These ladies were my teachers and I must respect them.\nHow could I tell at the end of three days if I should like them or not?\n\nI felt I _could_ tell, but I did not dare to say so. All I longed for\nwas to get away. So when the old lady went on putting words into my\nmouth, as it were, about being wiser for the future, and not touchy and\nfanciful, and so on, I agreed with her and said \"No, ma'am\" and \"Yes,\nma'am\" a few more times, meekly enough. Then she kissed me, and again I\nfelt that she meant to be kind and that it was wrong of me to disappoint\nher, but somehow I could not help it. And I went upstairs to bed feeling\nmore lonely than ever, now that I quite understood that my letters to\nmamma must never be anything more than I might write to a stranger--a\nmere mockery, in short.\n\nThere was but one person I felt that I could confide in. That was Miss\nFenmore. But the days went on and she seemed to take less instead of\nmore notice of me. I did not understand that her position, poor girl,\nwas much more difficult than mine. If she had seemed to pet me or make\nmuch of me it would only have made Miss Broom still more severe to me,\nand angry with her. For, as was scarcely to be wondered at, Miss Broom\nwas very indignant indeed at the way I had spoken of her in my letter to\nmamma. And Miss Fenmore was entirely at that time dependent upon her\nposition at Green Bank. She had no home, and if she brought displeasure\nupon herself at Miss Ledbury's her future would look very dark indeed.\n\nYet she was far from selfish. Her caution was quite as much for my sake\nas for her own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. \"NOBODY--_NOBODY_.\"\n\n\nThe history of that first week might stand for the history of several\nmonths at Green Bank. That is why I have related it as clearly as\npossible. In one sense I suppose people would say my life grew easier to\nme, that is to say I got more accustomed to it, but with the \"growing\naccustomed,\" increased the loss of hope and spring, so I doubt if time\ndid bring any real improvement.\n\nI became very dull and silent. I seemed to be losing the power of\ncomplaining, or even of wishing for sympathy. I took some interest in my\nlessons, and almost the only pleasure I had was when I got praise for\nthem. But that did not often happen, not as often as it should have\ndone, I really believe. For the prejudice against me on the part of the\nupper teachers did not wear off. And I can see now that I must have been\na disagreeable child.\n\nNor did I win more liking among my companions. They gradually came to\ntreat me with a sort of indifferent contempt.\n\n\"It's only that stupid child,\" I would hear said when I came into the\nroom.\n\nThe Christmas holidays came and went, without much improving matters. I\nspent them at school with one or two other pupils, much older than I.\nMiss Broom went away, and we were under Miss Aspinall's charge, for Miss\nLedbury had caught a bad cold and her niece would not leave her. I\npreferred Miss Aspinall to Miss Broom certainly, but I had half hoped\nthat Miss Fenmore would have stayed. She too went away, however, having\ngot a \"holiday engagement,\" which she was very glad of she told me when\nshe bade me good-bye. I did not understand what she meant, beyond\nhearing that she was glad to go, so I said nothing about being sorry.\n\n\"She doesn't care for me,\" I thought.\n\nI saw nothing of Haddie, though he wrote that he was very happy spending\nthe holidays at the house of one of his schoolfellows, and I was glad of\nthis, even while feeling so utterly deserted myself.\n\nIt was very, very dull, but I felt as if I did not mind. Even mamma's\nletters once a fortnight gave me only a kind of tantalising pleasure,\nfor I knew I dared not _really_ answer them. The only thing I felt glad\nof was that she did not know how lonely and unhappy I was, and that she\nnever would do so till the day--the day which I could scarcely believe\nwould ever, _ever_ come--when I should see her again, and feel her arms\nround me, and know that all the misery and loneliness were over!\n\nSome new pupils came after the Christmas holidays, and one or two of the\nelder girls did not return. But the new boarders were older than I and\ntook no notice of me, so their coming made no difference. One event,\nhowever, did interest me--that was the appearance at certain classes two\nor three times a week of a very sweet-looking little girl about my own\nage. She was pretty and very nicely dressed, though by no means showily,\nand her tone of voice and way of speaking were different from those of\nmost of my companions. I wished she had come altogether, and then I\nmight have made friends with her. \"Only,\" I said to myself unselfishly,\n\"she would most likely be as unhappy as I am, so I shouldn't wish for\nit.\"\n\nOne of the classes she came to was the French one--the class which, as I\nhave said, Miss Fenmore taught. And Miss Fenmore seemed to know her,\nfor she called her by her Christian name--\"Myra.\" The first time I heard\nit I felt quite puzzled. I knew I had heard it before, though I could\nnot remember where or when, except that it was not very long ago. And\nwhen I heard her last name, \"Raby\"--\"Miss Raby\" one of the other\nteachers called her--and put the two together--\"Myra Raby\"--I felt more\nand more certain I had heard them spoken of before, though I was equally\ncertain I had never seen the little girl herself.\n\nI might have asked Miss Fenmore about her, but it did not enter into my\nhead to do so: that was one of my odd childish ways. And it was partly,\ntoo, that I was growing more and more reserved and silent. Even to\nHarriet Smith I did not talk half as much as at first, and she used to\ntell me I was growing sulky.\n\nI took great interest in watching for Myra's appearance. I daresay if I\ncould make a picture of her now she would seem a quaint old-fashioned\nlittle figure to you, but to me she seemed perfectly lovely. She had\npretty brown hair, falling in ringlets round her delicate little face;\nher eyes were gray, very soft and gentle, and she had a dear little\nrosebud of a mouth. She was generally dressed in pale gray merino or\ncashmere, with white lace frilled round the neck and short sleeves--all\nlittle girls wore short sleeves then, even in winter; and once when I\ncaught a glimpse of her getting into a carriage which was waiting for\nher at the door, I was lost in admiration of her dark green cloth\npelisse trimmed with chinchilla fur.\n\n\"She must be somebody very rich and grand,\" I thought. But I had no\nopportunity of getting to know more of her, than a nice little smile or\na word or two of thanks if I passed her a book at the class or happened\nto sit next her. For she always left immediately after the lesson was\nover.\n\nUp to Easter she came regularly. Then we had three weeks' holidays, and\nas before, Miss Fenmore went away. She was pleased to go, but when she\nsaid good-bye to me I thought she looked sad, and she called me \"my poor\nlittle girl.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" I asked her. She smiled and answered that she did\nnot quite know; she thought I looked dull, and she wished I were going\ntoo.\n\n\"Are you less unhappy than when you first came to school?\" she said,\nlooking at me rather earnestly. It was very seldom she had an\nopportunity of speaking to me alone.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"I'm much unhappier when I think about it. But I'm\ngetting not to think, so I don't care.\"\n\nShe looked still graver at this. I fancy she saw that what I said was\ntrue. I was growing dulled and stupefied, as it were, for want of any\none to sympathise with me or draw me out, though I did not know quite\nhow to put this in words. As I have said before, I was not a child with\nmuch power of expression.\n\nMiss Fenmore kissed me, but she sighed as she did so.\n\n\"I wish----\" she began, but then she stopped. \"When I come back after\nEaster,\" she said more cheerfully, \"I hope I may somehow manage to see\nmore of you, dear Geraldine.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I answered. I daresay my voice did not sound as if I did\nthank her or as if I cared, though in my heart I was pleased, and often\nthought of what she had said during the holidays, which I found even\nduller than the Christmas ones had been.\n\nThey came to an end at last, however, but among the returning\ngovernesses and pupils there was no Miss Fenmore. Nor did Myra Raby come\nagain to the classes she used to attend. I wondered to myself why it\nwas so, but for some time I knew nothing about Miss Fenmore, and in the\nqueer silent way which was becoming my habit I did not ask. At last one\nday a new governess made her appearance, and then I overheard some of\nthe girls saying she was to take Miss Fenmore's place. A sort of choke\ncame into my throat, and for the first time I realised that I _had_ been\nlooking forward to the pretty young governess's return.\n\nI do not remember anything special happening for some time after that. I\nsuppose Easter must have been early that year, for when the events\noccurred which I am now going to relate, it was still cold and wintry\nweather--very rainy at least, and Mexington was always terribly gloomy\nin rainy weather. It seems a long stretch to look back upon--those weeks\nof the greatest loneliness I had yet known--but in reality I do not\nthink it could have been more than three or four.\n\nI continued to work steadily--even hard--at my lessons. I knew that it\nwould please mamma, and I had a vague feeling that somehow my getting on\nfast might shorten the time of our separation, though I could not have\nsaid why. I was really interested in some of my lessons, and anxious to\ndo well even in those I did not like. But I was not quick or clever,\nand often, very often, my hesitation in expressing myself made me seem\nfar less intelligent than I actually was. Still I generally got good\nmarks, especially for _written_ tasks, for the teachers, though hard and\nstrict, were not unprincipled. They did not like me, but they were fair\non the whole, I think.\n\nUnluckily, however, about this time I got a bad cold. I was not\nseriously ill, but it hung about me for some time and made me feel very\ndull and stupid. I think, too, it must have made me a little deaf,\nthough I did not know it at the time. I began to get on less well at\nlessons, very often making mistakes and replying at random, for which I\nwas scolded as if I did it out of carelessness.\n\nAnd though I tried more and more to prepare my lessons perfectly, things\ngrew worse and worse.\n\nAt last one day they came to a point. I forget what the lesson was, and\nit does not matter, but every time a question came to me I answered\nwrongly. Once or twice I did not hear, and when I said so, Miss Broom,\nwhose class it was, was angry, and said I was talking nonsense. It\nended in my bursting into tears, which I had never done before in\npublic since I had been at Green Bank.\n\nMiss Broom was very annoyed. She said a great deal to me which between\nmy tears and my deafness I did not hear, and at last she must have\nordered me to go up to my room, for her tone grew more and more angry.\n\n\"Do you mean to defy me?\" she said, so loud that I heard her plainly.\n\nI stared, and I do not know what would have happened if Harriet Smith,\nwho was near me, had not started up in her good-natured way.\n\n\"She doesn't hear; she's crying so,\" she said. \"Gerry, dear, Miss Broom\nsays you're to go up to your room.\"\n\nI was nothing loth. I got up from my seat and made my way more by\nfeeling than seeing--so blinded was I by crying--to the door, and\nupstairs.\n\nArrived there, I flung myself on to the end of my bed. It was cold, and\noutside it was raining, raining--it seems to me now that it never left\noff raining at Mexington that spring; the sky, if I had looked out of\nthe window, was one dull gray sheet. But I seemed to care for\nnothing--just at first the comfort of being able to cry with no one to\nlook at me was all I wanted. So I lay there sobbing, though not loudly.\n\nAfter some little time had passed the downstairs bell rang--it was\nafternoon, and the bell meant, I knew, preparation for tea. So I was not\nvery surprised when the door opened and Emma and Harriet came in--they\nwere both kind, Harriet especially, though her kindness was chiefly\nshown by loud abuse of Miss Broom.\n\n\"You'd better take care, Harry,\" said her sister at last, \"or you'll be\ngetting into disgrace yourself, which certainly won't do Gerry any good.\nDo be quick and make yourself tidy, the tea-bell will be ringing in a\nmoment. Hadn't you better wash your face and brush your hair, Gerry--you\ndo look such a figure.\"\n\n\"I can't go down unless Miss Broom says I may,\" I replied, \"and I don't\nwant any tea,\" though in my heart I knew I was feeling hungry. Much\ncrying often makes children hungry; they are not like grown-up people.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense,\" said Emma. \"You'd feel ever so much better if you had\nsome tea. What _I_ think you're so silly for is _minding_--why need you\ncare what that old Broom says? She daren't beat you or starve you, and\nonce you're at home again you can snap your fingers at school and\ngovernesses and----\"\n\nHere Harriet said something to her sister in a low voice which I did not\nhear. It made Emma stop.\n\n\"Oh, well, I can't help it,\" she said, or something of that kind. \"It\ndoesn't do any good to cry like that, whatever troubles you have,\" she\nwent on.\n\nI got up slowly and tried to wash away some of the traces of my tears by\nplunging my face in cold water. Then Harriet helped me to smooth my hair\nand make myself look neat. Emma's words had had the effect of making me\nresolve to cry no more if I could help it. And a moment or two later I\nwas glad I had followed her advice, for one of the elder girls came to\nour room with a message to say that I was to go down to tea, and after\ntea I was to stay behind in the dining-room as Miss Aspinall wished to\nspeak to me.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said. But the moment the other girl had gone both Emma\nand Harriet began again.\n\n\"That horrid old Broom,\" said Harriet, \"just fancy her complaining to\nMiss Aspinall.\"\n\nAnd \"Promise me, Gerry,\" said Emma, \"not to mind what she says, and\nwhatever you do, don't cry. There's nothing vexes old Broom so much as\nseeing we don't care--mean old cat.\"\n\nI could scarcely help laughing, my spirits had got up a little--that is\nto say, I felt more angry than sad now. I felt as if I really did _not_\nmuch care what was said to me.\n\nAnd I drank my tea and ate my slices of thick bread and butter with a\ngood appetite, though I saw Miss Broom watching me from her end of the\ntable; and when I had finished I felt, as Emma had said I should, \"ever\nso much better\"--that is to say, no longer in the least inclined to cry.\n\nNor did I feel nervous or frightened when Miss Aspinall--all the others\nhaving gone--seated herself in front of me and began her talk. It began\nquite differently from what I had expected. She was a good woman, and\nnot nearly so bad-tempered as Miss Broom, though hard and cold, and I am\nsure she meant to do me good. She talked about how changed I had been of\nlate, my lessons so much less well done, and how careless and\ninattentive I seemed. There was some truth in it. I knew my lessons had\nnot been so well done, but I also knew I had not been careless or\ninattentive.\n\n\"And worst of all,\" continued the governess, \"you have got into such a\nhabit of making excuses that it really amounts to telling untruths.\nSeveral times, Miss Broom tells me, you have done a wrong lesson or not\ndone one at all, and you have maintained to her that you had not been\ntold what you _had_ been told--there was something about your French\npoetry yesterday, which you _must_ have known you were to learn. Miss\nBroom says you positively denied it.\"\n\nI was getting very angry now--I had wanted to say I was sorry about my\nlessons, but now that I was accused of not speaking the truth I felt\nnothing but anger.\n\n\"I never tell stories,\" I said very loudly; \"and if Miss Broom says I\ndo, I'll write to mamma and tell her. I _won't_ stay here if you say\nsuch things to me.\"\n\nMiss Aspinall was quite startled; she had never seen me in a passion\nbefore, for I was usually considered in the school as sulky rather than\nviolent-tempered. For a moment or two she stared, too astonished to\nspeak. Then,\n\n\"Go back to your room,\" she said. \"I am sorry to say I must lay this\nbefore Miss Ledbury.\"\n\nI got up from my seat--Miss Aspinall had not kept me standing--and went\nupstairs again to my room, where I stayed for the rest of the evening,\nmy supper--a cup of milk and a piece of dry bread--being brought me by a\nservant, and with it a message that I was to undress and go to bed,\nwhich I was not sorry to do.\n\nI lay there, not asleep, and still burning with indignation, when\nHarriet came up to bed. She had not been told not to speak to me, very\nlikely the teachers thought I would be asleep, and she was very curious\nto know what had passed. I told her all. She was very sympathising, but\nat the same time she thought it a pity I had lost my temper with Miss\nAspinall.\n\n\"I don't know how you'll get on now,\" she said, \"with both her and Miss\nBroom so against you. You should just not have minded--like Emma said.\"\n\n\"Not mind her saying I told stories!\" I burst out. Harriet did not seem\nto think there was anything specially annoying in that. \"Well,\" I went\non, \"_I_ mind it, whether you do or not. And I'm _going_ to mind it. I\nshall write to mamma and tell her I can't stay here any more, and I'm\nsure when she hears it she'll do _something_. She won't let me stay\nhere. Or--or--perhaps father will fix to come home again and not stay as\nlong as two years there.\"\n\n\"I don't think he'll do that,\" said Harriet mysteriously.\n\n\"What do you mean? What do you know about it?\" I asked, for something in\nher voice struck me.\n\n\"Oh, nothing--I shouldn't have said it--it was only something I heard,\"\nshe replied, looking rather confused.\n\n\"Something you heard,\" I repeated, starting up in bed and catching hold\nof her. \"Then you _must_ tell me. Do you mean there's been letters or\nnews about father and mamma that I don't know about?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Harriet. \"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean? You shall tell me--if you don't,\" I went on,\nmore and more excitedly, \"I'll--\" I hesitated--\"I'll tell you what I'll\ndo, I'll go straight downstairs, just as I am, in my nightgown, to Miss\nLedbury herself, and tell her what you've said. I don't care if she\nbeats me, I don't care what she does, but I _will_ know.\"\n\nHarriet tried to pull herself away.\n\n\"What a horrid temper you're getting, Gerry,\" she said complainingly.\n\"Just when I hurried up to bed as quick as I could to talk to you. It's\nnothing, I tell you--only something I heard at home, and Emma said I\nwasn't ever to tell it you.\"\n\nI clutched her more firmly.\n\n\"You shall tell me, or I'll do what I said.\"\n\nHarriet looked really frightened.\n\n\"You'll not tell Emma, then? You promise?\"\n\nI nodded. \"I promise.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it was only one day--papa was talking about somebody going\nto South America, and I said that was where your papa and mamma had\ngone, and papa asked your name, and then he said he had seen your papa\nat the bank, and it was a pity he hadn't been content to stay there. It\nwas such a bad climate where he'd gone--lots of people got ill and died\nthere, unless they were rich enough to live out of the town, and he\ndidn't suppose any one who'd only been a clerk in the bank here would be\nthat. And Emma said, couldn't your papa and mamma come back if they got\nill, and he said if they waited till then it would be rather too late.\nThere's some fever people get there, that comes all of a sudden. And\nbesides that, your papa must have promised he'd stay two years--they\nalways do.\"\n\nAs she went on, my heart fell lower and lower--for a moment or two I\ncould not speak. All sorts of dreadful fears and imaginings began to\nfill my mind; perhaps my parents had already got that terrible illness\nHarriet spoke of, perhaps one or both of them had already died. I could\nhave screamed aloud. I felt I could not bear it--I must write to mamma a\nletter that nobody should read. I must see somebody who would tell me\nthe truth--Haddie, perhaps, knew more than I did. If I could go to him!\nBut I had no money and no idea of the way, and Miss Aspinall would\nnever, _never_ let me even write to ask him. Besides, I was in disgrace,\nvery likely they would not believe me if I told them why I was so\nmiserable; they had already said I told stories, and then I must not get\nHarriet into trouble.\n\nWhat _should_ I do? If only Miss Fenmore had still been there, I felt\nshe would have been sorry for me, but there was nobody--_nobody_.\n\nI turned my face away from my little companion, and buried it in the\npillow. Harriet grew frightened.\n\n\"What are you doing, Gerry?\" she said. \"Why don't you speak? Are you\ngoing to sleep or are you crying? Very likely your papa and mamma won't\nget that illness. I wish I hadn't told you.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said. \"I'm going to sleep.\"\n\n\"And you won't tell Emma?\" Harriet repeated.\n\n\"Of course not--don't you believe my word? Do you too think that I tell\nstories?\"\n\nI tried to get rid of my misery by letting myself grow angry.\n\n\"You're very cross,\" said Harriet; but all the same I think she\nunderstood me better than she could express, for she kissed me and said,\n\"Do go to sleep--don't be so unhappy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. OUT IN THE RAIN.\n\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that I did not sleep that night.\nChildren often sleep very heavily when they are specially unhappy, and I\nwas unhappy enough, even before Harriet's telling me what she had heard.\nBut though I did sleep, I shall never forget that night. My dreams were\nso miserable, and when I awoke--very early in the morning--I could\nscarcely separate them from real things. It was actually not so bad when\nI was quite awake, for then I set myself thoroughly to think it all\nover.\n\nI could not bear it--I could not go on without knowing if it was true\nabout father and mamma. I could not bear my life at school, if the\nlooking forward to being with them again, before _very_ long, was to be\ntaken from me. I must write a letter to mamma that no one would see; but\nfirst--yes, first I must know how much was true. Whom could I ask?\nHaddie? Perhaps he knew no more than I did, and it was just as difficult\nto write to him as to mamma. Then suddenly another thought struck\nme--Mrs. Selwood, old Mrs. Selwood, if I could but see her. Perhaps if I\nwrote to her she would come to see me; mamma always said she was very\nkind, though I know she did not care much for children, especially\nlittle girls. Still I thought I would try, though it would be difficult,\nfor I should not like Miss Ledbury to know I had written to Mrs. Selwood\nsecretly. She would be so angry, and I did not want to make Miss Ledbury\nangry. She was much nicer than the others. Once or twice the idea came\nto me of going straight to her and telling her how miserable I was, but\nthat would bring in Harriet, and oh, how furious the other governesses\nwould be! No, I would try to write to Mrs. Selwood--only, I did not know\nher address. I only knew the name of her house--Fernley--that would not\nbe enough, at least I feared not. I would try to find out; perhaps\nHarriet could ask some one when she went home.\n\nMy spirits rose a little with all this planning. I am afraid that the\nlife I led was beginning to make me unchildlike and concealed in my\nways. I enjoyed the feeling of having a secret and, so to say,\noutwitting my teachers, particularly Miss Broom. So, though I was\nlooking pale and my eyes were still very swollen, I think Harriet was\nsurprised, and certainly very glad, to find that I was not very\nmiserable or upset.\n\nA message was sent up to say I was to go down to breakfast with the\nothers. And after prayers and breakfast were over I went into the\nschoolroom as usual.\n\nThat morning did not pass badly; it happened to be a day for lessons I\ngot on well with--written ones principally, and reading aloud. So I got\ninto no fresh disgrace. It was a very rainy day, there was no question\nof going out, and I was sent to practise at twelve o'clock till the\ndressing-bell rang for the early dinner. That was to keep me away from\nthe other girls.\n\nAs soon as dinner was over Miss Broom came to me with a French poetry\nbook in her hand.\n\n\"This is the poem you should have learnt yesterday,\" she said, \"though\nyou denied having been told so. Miss Aspinall desires you to take it\nupstairs to your room and learn it, as you can do perfectly, if you\nchoose, by three o'clock. Then you are to come downstairs to the\ndrawing-room, where you will find her.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, as I took the book, \"I will learn it.\"\n\nThey were going to let me off rather easily, I thought, and possibly,\njust _possibly_, if Miss Ledbury was in the drawing-room too and seemed\nkind, I might ask her to give me leave to write to Mrs. Selwood just to\nsay how very much I would like to see her, and then if I _did_ see her I\ncould tell her what Harriet had said, without risking getting Harriet\ninto trouble.\n\nSo I set to work at my French poetry with good will, and long before\nthree o'clock I had learnt it perfectly. There was a clock on the\nlanding half-way down the staircase which struck the quarters and\nhalf-hours. I heard the quarter to three strike and then I read the poem\nright through six times, and after that, closing the book, I said it\naloud to myself without one mistake, and then just as the clock began\n\"_burr_-ing\" before striking the hour I made my way quietly down to the\ndrawing-room.\n\nI tapped at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Miss Aspinall.\n\nShe was standing beside Miss Ledbury, who was sitting in an arm-chair\nnear the fire. She looked very pale, her face nearly as white as her\nhair, and it made me feel sorry, so that I stared at her and forgot to\ncurtsey as we always were expected to do on entering a room where any of\nthe governesses were.\n\n\"Do you not see Miss Ledbury?\" said Miss Aspinall sharply. I felt my\ncheeks get red, and I turned back towards the door to make my curtsey.\n\n\"I--I forgot,\" I said, and before Miss Aspinall had time to speak again,\nthe old lady held out her hand.\n\n\"You must try to be more thoughtful,\" she said, but her voice was\ngentle. \"Now give me your book,\" she went on, \"I want to hear your\nFrench verses myself.\"\n\nI handed her the book, which was open at the place. I felt very glad I\nhad learnt the poetry so well, as I wished to please Miss Ledbury.\n\n\"Begin, my dear,\" she said.\n\nI did so, repeating the six or eight verses without any mistake or\nhesitation.\n\nMiss Ledbury seemed pleased and relieved.\n\n\"Very well said--now, my dear child, that shows that you can learn well\nwhen you try.\"\n\n\"Of course she can,\" said Miss Aspinall.\n\n\"But more important than learning your lessons well,\" continued Miss\nLedbury, \"is to be perfectly truthful and honest. What has distressed\nme, Geraldine, has been to hear that when--as may happen to any\nchild--you have forgotten a lesson, or learnt it imperfectly, instead of\nat once owning your fault, you have tried to screen yourself behind\ninsincere excuses. That was the case about these very verses, was it\nnot, Miss Aspinall?\" (Miss Ledbury always called her niece \"Miss\nAspinall\" before any of us.)\n\n\"It was,\" replied Miss Aspinall. \"Miss Broom will tell you all the\nparticulars,\" and as she spoke Miss Broom came in.\n\nMiss Ledbury turned to her.\n\n\"I wish you to state exactly what you have had to complain of in\nGeraldine Le Marchant,\" she said. And Miss Broom, with a far from\namiable expression, repeated the whole--my carelessness and ill-prepared\nlessons for some time past, the frequent excuses I made, saying that she\nhad not told me what she certainly _had_ told me, my forgetting my\nFrench poetry altogether, and persisting in denying that it had been\ngiven out.\n\nI did not hear clearly all she said, but she raised her voice at the\nend, and I caught her last words. I felt again a sort of fury at her,\nand I gave up all idea of confiding in Miss Ledbury, or of trying to\nplease any one.\n\nMiss Ledbury seemed nervous.\n\n\"Geraldine has said her French poetry perfectly,\" she said. \"I think she\nhas taken pains to learn it well.\"\n\n\"It is some time since she has said any lesson perfectly to _me_, I am\nsorry to say,\" snapped Miss Broom.\n\nMiss Ledbury handed her the book.\n\n\"You can judge for yourself,\" she said. \"Repeat the verses to Miss\nBroom, Geraldine.\"\n\nThen a strange thing happened. I really wanted to say the poetry well,\npartly out of pride, partly because again something in Miss Ledbury's\nmanner made me feel gentler, but as I opened my mouth to begin, the\nwords entirely left my memory. I looked up--possibly a little help, a\nsyllable just to start me, would have set me right, but instead of that\nI saw Miss Broom's half-mocking, half-angry face, and Miss Aspinall's\ncold hard eyes. Miss Ledbury I did not look at. In reality I think both\nshe and Miss Aspinall were afraid of Miss Broom. I do not think Miss\nAspinall was as hard as she seemed.\n\nI drew a long breath--no, it was no use. I could not recall one word.\n\n\"I've forgotten it,\" I said.\n\nMiss Aspinall gave an exclamation--Miss Ledbury looked at me with\nreproach. Both believed that I was not speaking the truth, and that I\nhad determined not to say the verses to Miss Broom.\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Miss Aspinall.\n\n\"Geraldine,\" said Miss Ledbury sadly but sternly, \"do not make me\ndistrust you.\"\n\nI grew stony. Now I did not care. Even Miss Ledbury doubted my word. I\nalmost think if the verses had come back to me then, I would not have\nsaid them. I stood there, dull and stupid and obstinate, though a\nperfect fire was raging inside me.\n\n\"Geraldine,\" said Miss Ledbury again, still more sadly and sternly.\n\nI was only a child, and I was almost exhausted by all I had gone\nthrough. Even my pride gave way. I forgot all that Emma and Harriet had\nsaid about not crying, and, half turning away from the three before me,\nI burst into a loud fit of tears and sobbing.\n\nMiss Ledbury glanced at her niece. I think the old lady had hard work to\nkeep herself from some impulsive kind action, but I suppose she would\nhave thought it wrong. But Miss Aspinall came towards me, and placed her\narm on my shoulders.\n\n\"Geraldine,\" she said, and her voice was not unkind, \"I beg you to try\nto master this naughty obstinate spirit. Say the verses again, and all\nmay be well.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I cried. \"I can't, I can't. It is true that I've forgotten\nthem, and if I could say them I wouldn't now, because you all think me a\nstory-teller.\"\n\nShe turned away, really grieved and shocked.\n\n\"Take her upstairs to her room again,\" said Miss Ledbury. \"Geraldine,\nyour tears are only those of anger and temper.\"\n\nI did not care now. I suffered myself to be led back to my room, and I\nleft off crying almost as suddenly as I had begun, and when Miss\nAspinall shut the door, and left me there without speaking to me again,\nI sat down on the foot of my bed as if I did not care at all, for again\nthere came over me that strange stolid feeling that nothing mattered,\nthat nothing would ever make me cry again.\n\nIt did not last long, however. I got up in a few minutes and looked out\nof the window. It was the dullest afternoon I had ever seen, raining,\nraining steadily, the sky all gloomy no-colour, duller even than gray.\nIt might have been any season, late autumn, mid-winter; there was not a\nleaf, or the tiniest beginning of one, on the black branches of the two\nor three trees in what was called \"the garden\"--for my window looked to\nthe back of the house--not the very least feeling of spring, even though\nwe were some way on in April. I gave a little shiver, and then a sudden\nthought struck me. It would be a very good time for getting out without\nany one seeing me--no one would fancy it possible that I would venture\nout in the rain, and all my schoolfellows and the governesses were still\nat lessons. What was the use of waiting here? They might keep me shut up\nin my room for--for ever, perhaps--and I should never know about father\nand mamma, or get Mrs. Selwood's address or be allowed to write to her,\nor--or any one. I would go.\n\nIt took but a few minutes to put on my things. As I have said, there was\na queer mixture of childishness and \"old-fashionedness,\" as it is\ncalled, about me. I dressed myself as sensibly as if I had been a\ngrown-up person, choosing my thickest boots and warm jacket, and arming\nmyself with my waterproof cape and umbrella. I also put my purse in my\npocket--it contained a few shillings.\n\nThen I opened the door and listened, going out a little way into the\npassage to do so. All was quite quiet--not even a piano was to be heard,\nonly the clock on the landing sounded to me much louder than usual. If I\nhad waited long, it would have made me nervous. I should have begun to\nfancy it was talking to me like Dick Whittington's bells, though, I am\nsure, it would not have said anything half so cheering!\n\n[I CREPT DOWNSTAIRS, PAST ONE SCHOOLROOM WITH ITS CLOSED\nDOOR.]\n\nBut I did not wait to hear. I crept downstairs, past one schoolroom with\nits closed door, and a muffled sound of voices as I drew quite close to\nit, then on again, past the downstairs class-room, and along the hall to\nthe front door. For that was what I had made up my mind was the best,\nbold as it seemed. I would go right out by the front door. I knew it\nopened easily, for we went out that way on Sundays to church, and once\nor twice I had opened it. And nobody would ever dream of my passing out\nthat way.\n\nIt was all managed quite easily, and almost before I had time to take\nin what I had done, I found myself out in the road some little distance\nfrom Green Bank, for as soon as the gate closed behind me I had set off\nrunning from a half-nervous fear that some one might be coming in\npursuit of me. I ran on a little farther, in the same direction, that of\nthe town, for Miss Ledbury's house was in the outskirts--then, out of\nbreath, I stood still to think what I should do.\n\nI had really not made any distinct plan. The only idea clearly in my\nmind was to get Mrs. Selwood's address, so that I could write to her.\nBut as I stood there, another thought struck me. I would go home--to the\nhouse in the dull street which had never seemed dull to me! For there, I\nsuddenly remembered, I might find one of our own servants. I recollected\nLydia's telling me that cook was probably going to \"engage\" with the\npeople who had taken the house. And cook would be sure to know Mrs.\nSelwood's address, and--_perhaps_--cook would be able to tell me\nsomething about father and mamma. She was a kind woman--I would not mind\ntelling her how dreadfully frightened I was about them since Harriet\nSmith had repeated what she had heard.\n\nI knew the way to our house, at least I thought I did, though afterwards\nI found I had taken two or three wrong turnings, which had made my\njourney longer. It was scarcely raining by this time, but the streets\nwere dreadfully wet and muddy, and the sky still dark and gloomy.\n\nAt last I found myself at the well-known corner of our street--how often\nI had run round it with Haddie, when we had been allowed to go on some\nlittle errand by ourselves! I had not passed this way since mamma went,\nand the feeling that came over me was very strange. I went along till I\ncame to our house, number 39; then, in a sort of dream, I mounted the\ntwo or three steps to the door, and rang the bell. How well I knew its\nsound! It seemed impossible to believe that Lydia would not open to me,\nand that if I hurried upstairs I should not find mamma sitting in her\nusual place in the drawing-room!\n\nBut of course it was not so. A strange face met me as the door drew\nback, and for a moment or two I felt too confused to speak, though I saw\nthe servant was looking at me in surprise.\n\n\"Is--can I see cook?\" I got out at last.\n\n\"Cook,\" the maid repeated. \"I'm sure I can't say. Can't you give me\nyour message--Miss?\" adding the last word after a little hesitation.\n\n\"I'd rather see her, please. I want to ask her for Mrs. Selwood's\naddress. Mrs. Selwood's a friend of mamma's, and I'm sure cook would\nknow. We used to live here, and Lydia said cook was going to stay.\"\n\nThe servant's face cleared, but her reply was not encouraging.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I see. But it's no use your seeing our cook, Miss.\nShe's a stranger. The other one--Sarah Wells was her name----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I exclaimed, \"that's her.\"\n\n\"She's gone--weeks ago. Her father was ill, and she had to go home. I'm\nsorry, Miss\"--she was a good-natured girl--\"but it can't be helped. And\nI think you'd better go home quick. It's coming on to rain again, and\nit'll soon be dark, and you're such a little young lady to be out\nalone.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, and I turned away, my heart swelling with\ndisappointment.\n\nI walked on quickly for a little way, for I felt sure the servant was\nlooking after me. Then I stopped short and asked myself again \"what\nshould I do?\" The girl had advised me to go \"home\"--\"home\" to Green\nBank, to be shut up in my room again, and be treated as a story-teller,\nand never have a chance of writing to Mrs. Selwood or any one! No, that\nI would not do. The very thought of it made me hasten my steps as if to\nput a greater distance between myself and Miss Ledbury's house. And I\nwalked on some way without knowing where I was going except that it was\nin an opposite direction from school.\n\nIt must have been nearly six o'clock by this time, and the gloomy day\nmade it already dusk. The shops were lighting up, and the glare of the\ngas on the wet pavement made me look about me. I was in one of the\nlarger streets now, a very long one, that led right out from the centre\nof the town to the outskirts. I was full of a strange kind of\nexcitement; I did not mind the rain, and indeed it was not very heavy; I\ndid not feel lonely or frightened, and my brain seemed unusually active\nand awake.\n\n\"I know what I'll do,\" I said to myself; \"I'll go to the big grocer's\nwhere they give Haddie and me those nice gingerbreads, and I'll ask\n_them_ for Mrs. Selwood's address. I remember mamma said Mrs. Selwood\nalways bought things there. And--and--I won't write to her. I'll go to\nthe railway and see if I've money enough to get a ticket, and I'll go\nto Mrs. Selwood and tell her how I can't bear it any longer. I've got\nfour shillings, and if that isn't enough I daresay the railway people\nwouldn't mind if I promised I'd send it them.\"\n\nI marched on, feeling once more very determined and valiant. I thought I\nknew the way to the big grocer's quite well, but when I turned down a\nstreet which looked like the one where it was, I began to feel a little\nconfused. There were so many shops, and the lights in the windows\ndazzled me, and worst of all, I could not remember the name of the\ngrocer's. It was something like Simpson, but not Simpson. I went on,\nturning again more than once, always in hopes of seeing it before me,\nbut always disappointed. And I was beginning to feel very tired; I must,\nI suppose, have been really tired all the time, but my excitement had\nkept me up.\n\nAt last I found myself in a much darker street than the others. For\nthere were few shops in it, and most of the houses were offices of some\nkind. It was a wide street and rather hilly. As I stood at the top I saw\nit sloping down before me; the light of the tall lamps glimmered\nbrokenly in the puddles, for it was raining again more heavily now.\nSuddenly, as if in a dream, some words came back to me, so clearly that\nI could almost have believed some one was speaking. It was mamma's\nvoice.\n\n\"You had better put on your mackintosh, Haddie,\" I seemed to hear her\nsay, and then I remembered it all--it came before me like a\npicture--that rainy evening not many months ago when mamma and Haddie\nand I had walked home so happily, we two tugging at her arms, one on\neach side, heedless of the rain or the darkness, or anything except that\nwe were all together.\n\nI stood still. Never, I think, was a child's heart more nearly\nbreaking.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. TAKING REFUGE.\n\n\nFor a minute or two I seemed to feel nothing; then there came over me a\nsort of shiver, partly of cold, for it _was_ very cold, partly of\nmisery. I roused myself, however. With the remembrance of that other\nevening had come to me also the knowledge of where I was. Only a few\nyards down the sloping street on the left-hand side came a wide stretch\nof pavement, and there, in a kind of angle, stood a double door, open on\nboth sides, leading into a small outer hall, from which again another\ndoor, glazed at the top, was the entrance to Cranston's show-rooms.\n\nI remembered it all perfectly. Just beyond the inner entrance stood the\ntwo carved lions that Haddie and I admired so much. I wished I could see\nthem again, and--yes--a flash of joy went through me at the thought--I\ncould get Mrs. Selwood's address quite as well from old Mr. Cranston as\nfrom the big grocer!\n\nAs soon as the idea struck me I hurried on, seeming to gain fresh\nstrength and energy. It was almost dark, but a gas-lamp was burning\ndimly above the lintel, and inside, on the glass of the inner door, were\nthe large gilt letters \"Cranston and Co.\"\n\nI ran up the two or three broad shallow steps and pushed open the door,\nwhich was a swing one. It was nearly time for closing, but that I did\nnot know. There was no one to be seen inside, not, at least, in the\nfirst room, and the door made no noise. But there stood the dear\nlions--I could not see them very clearly, for the place was not brightly\nlighted, but I crept up to them, and stroked softly the one nearest me.\nThey seemed like real friends.\n\nI had not courage to go into the other show-room, and all was so\nperfectly still that I could scarcely think any one was there. I thought\nI would wait a few minutes in hopes of some one coming out, of whom I\ncould inquire if I could see Mr. Cranston. And I was now beginning to\nfeel so tired--so very tired, and so cold.\n\nIn here, though I did not see any fire, it felt ever so much warmer than\noutside. There was no chair or stool, but I found a seat for myself on\nthe stand of the farther-in lion--each of them had a heavy wooden\nstand. It seemed very comfortable, and I soon found that by moving on a\nlittle I could get a nice rest for my head against the lion's body. A\nstrange pleasant sense of protection and comfort came over me.\n\n\"How glad I am I came in here,\" I said to myself. \"I don't mind if I\nhave to wait a good while. It is so cosy and warm.\"\n\nI no longer made any plans. I knew I wanted to ask for Mrs. Selwood's\naddress, but that was all I thought of. What I should do when I had got\nit I did not know; where I should go for the night, for it was now quite\ndark, I did not trouble about in the least. I think I must have been\nvery much in the condition I have heard described, of travellers lost in\nthe snow--the overpowering wish to stay where I was and rest, was all I\nwas conscious of. I did not think of going to sleep. I did not know I\nwas sleepy.\n\nAnd for some time I knew nothing.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was a very low murmur--so low\nthat it might have been merely a breath of air playing in the keyhole; I\nseemed to have been hearing it for some time before it took shape, as it\nwere, and grew into a softly-whispering voice, gradually gathering into\nwords.\n\n\"Poor little girl; so she has come at last. Well, as you say, brother,\nwe have been expecting her for a good while, have we not?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, but speak softly. It would be a pity to awake her. And\nwhat we have to do can be done just as well while she sleeps.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" said the first speaker. \"I should much prefer\nher being awake. She would enjoy the ride, and she is an intelligent\nchild and would profit by our conversation.\"\n\n\"As you like,\" replied number two. \"I must be off to fetch the boy. She\nwill perhaps be awake by the time I return.\"\n\nAnd then--just as I was on the point of starting up and telling them I\n_was_ awake--came a sound of stamping and rustling, and a sort of whirr\nand a breath of cold air, which told me the swing door had been opened.\nAnd when I sat straight up and looked about me, lo and behold, there was\nonly one lion to be seen--the stand of his brother was empty!\n\n\"I--please I _am_ awake,\" I said rather timidly. \"It was me you were\ntalking about, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"_I_--'it was _I_'--the verb to be takes the same case after it as\nbefore it,\" was the reply, much to my surprise and rather to my disgust.\nWho would have thought that the carved lions bothered about grammar!\n\n\"It was I, then,\" I repeated meekly. I did not want to give any offence\nto my new friend. \"Please--I heard you saying something--something about\ngoing a ride. And where has the--the other Mr. Lion gone? I heard\nabout--a boy.\"\n\n\"You heard correctly,\" my lion replied, and I knew somehow that he was\nsmiling, or whatever lions do that matches smiling. \"My brother has gone\nto fetch _your_ brother--we planned it all some time ago--we shall meet\non the sea-shore and travel together. But we should be starting. Can you\nclimb up on to my back?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" I said quite calmly, as if there was nothing the least out of\nthe common in all this, \"I'm sure I can.\"\n\n\"Catch hold of my mane,\" said the lion; \"don't mind tugging, it won't\nhurt,\" and--not to my surprise, for nothing surprised me--I felt my\nhands full of soft silky hair, as the lion shook down his long wavy mane\nto help my ascent.\n\nNothing was easier. In another moment I was cosily settled on his back,\nwhich felt deliciously comfortable, and the mane seemed to tuck itself\nround me like a fleecy rug.\n\n\"Shut your eyes,\" said my conductor or steed, I don't know which to call\nhim; \"go to sleep if you like. I'll wake you when we meet the others.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, feeling too content and comfortable to disagree\nwith anything he said.\n\nThen came a feeling of being raised up, a breath of colder air, which\nseemed to grow warm again almost immediately, and I knew nothing more\ntill I heard the words, \"Here they are.\"\n\nI opened my eyes and looked about me. It was night--overhead in the deep\nblue sky innumerable stars were sparkling, and down below at our feet I\nheard the lap-lap of rippling waves. A dark, half-shadowy figure stood\nat my right hand, and as I saw it more clearly I distinguished the form\nof the other lion, with--yes, there was some one sitting on his back.\n\n\"Haddie,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Geraldine, it's me,\" my brother's own dear voice replied.\n\"We're going right over the sea--did you know?--isn't it splendid? We're\ngoing to see father and mamma. Hold out your hand so that you can feel\nmine.\"\n\n[THE BROTHER LIONS ROSE INTO THE AIR.]\n\nI did so, and my fingers clasped his, and at that moment the brother\nlions rose into the air, and down below, even fainter and fainter, came\nthe murmur of the sea, while up above, the twinkling stars looked down\non what surely was one of the strangest sights they had ever seen in all\ntheir long, long experience!\n\nThen again I seemed to know nothing, though somehow, all through, I felt\nthe clasp of Haddie's hand and knew we were close together.\n\nA beautiful light streaming down upon us, of which I was conscious even\nthrough my closed eyelids, was the next thing I remember. It seemed warm\nas well as bright, and I felt as if basking in it.\n\n\"Wake up, Geraldine,\" said Haddie's voice.\n\nI opened my eyes. But now I have come to a part of my story which I have\nnever been able, and never shall be able, to put into fitting words. The\nscene before me was too beautiful, too magically exquisite for me even\nto succeed in giving the faintest idea of it. Still I must try, though\nknowing that I cannot but fail.\n\nCan you picture to yourselves the loveliest day of all the perfect\nsummer days you have ever known--no, more than that, a day like summer\nand spring in one--the richness of colour, the balmy fragrance of the\nprime of the year joined to the freshness, the indescribable hopefulness\nand expectation which is the charm of the spring? The beauty and delight\nseemed made up of everything lovely mingled together--sights, sounds,\nscents, feelings. There was the murmur of running streams, the singing\nof birds, the most delicious scent from the flowers growing in profusion\nand of every shade of colour.\n\nHaddie and I looked at each other--we still held each other by the hand,\nbut now, somehow, we were standing together on the grass, though I could\nnot remember having got down from my perch on the lion's back.\n\n\"Where are the lions, Haddie?\" I said.\n\nHaddie seemed to understand everything better than I did.\n\n\"They're all right,\" he replied, \"resting a little. You see we've come a\nlong way, Geraldine, and so quick.\"\n\n\"And where are we?\" I asked. \"What is this place, Haddie? Is it\nfairyland or--or--heaven?\"\n\nHaddie smiled.\n\n\"It's not either,\" he said. \"You'll find out the name yourself. But\ncome, we must be quick, for we can't stay very long. Hold my hand tight\nand then we can run faster.\"\n\nI seemed to know that something more beautiful than anything we had seen\nyet was coming. I did not ask Haddie any more questions, even though I\nhad a feeling that he knew more than I did. He seemed quite at home in\nthis wonderful place, quite able to guide me. And his face was shining\nwith happiness.\n\nWe ran a good way, and very fast. But I did not feel at all tired or\nbreathless. My feet seemed to have wings, and all the time the garden\naround us grew lovelier and lovelier. If Haddie had not been holding my\nhand so fast I should scarcely have been able to resist stopping to\ngather some of the lovely flowers everywhere in such profusion, or to\nstand still to listen to the dear little birds singing so exquisitely\noverhead.\n\n\"It must be fairyland,\" I repeated to myself more than once, in spite of\nwhat Haddie had said.\n\nBut suddenly all thought of fairyland or flowers, birds and garden, went\nout of my head, as Haddie stopped in his running.\n\n\"Geraldine,\" he half whispered, \"look there.\"\n\n\"There\" was a little arbour a few yards from where we stood, and there,\nseated on a rustic bench, her dear face all sunshine, was mamma!\n\nShe started up as soon as she saw us and hastened forward, her arms\noutstretched.\n\n\"My darlings, my darlings,\" she said, as Haddie and I threw ourselves\nupon her.\n\nShe did look so pretty; she was all in white, and she had a rose--one of\nthe lovely roses I had been admiring as we ran--fastened to the front of\nher dress.\n\n\"Mamma, mamma,\" I exclaimed, as I hugged her, \"oh, mamma, I am so happy\nto be with you. Is this your garden, mamma, and may we stay with you\nalways now? Wasn't it good of the lions to bring us? I have been so\nunhappy, mamma--somebody said you would get ill far away. But nobody\ncould get ill here. Oh, mamma, you will let us stay always.\"\n\nShe did not speak, but looking at Haddie I saw a change in his face.\n\n\"Geraldine,\" he said, \"I told you we couldn't stay long. The lions would\nbe scolded if we did, and you know you must say your French poetry.\"\n\nAnd then there came over me the most agonising feeling of\ndisappointment and misery. All the pent-up wretchedness of the last\nweeks at school woke up and overwhelmed me like waves of dark water. It\nis as impossible for me to put this into words as it was for me to\ndescribe my exquisite happiness, for no words ever succeed in expressing\nthe intense and extraordinary sensations of some dreams. And of course,\nas you will have found out by this time, the strange adventures I have\nbeen relating were those of a dream, though I still, after all the years\nthat have passed since then, remember them so vividly.\n\nIt was the fatal words \"French poetry\" that seemed to awake me--to bring\nback my terrible unhappiness, exaggerated by the fact of my dreaming.\n\n\"French poetry,\" I gasped, \"oh, Haddie, how can you remind me of it?\"\n\nHaddie suddenly turned away, and I saw the face of one of the lions\nlooking over his shoulder, with, strange to say, a white frilled cap\nsurrounding it.\n\n\"You must try to drink this, my dear,\" said the lion, if the lion it\nwas, for as I stared at him the brown face changed into a rather ruddy\none--a round good-humoured face, with pleasant eyes and smile, reminding\nme of mamma's old nurse who had once come to see us.\n\nI stared still more, and sat up a little, for, wonderful to relate, I\nwas no longer in the lovely garden, no longer even in the show-room\nleaning against the lion: I was in bed in a strange room which I had\nnever seen before. And leaning over me was the owner of the frilled cap,\nholding a glass in her hand.\n\n\"Try to drink this, my dearie,\" she said again, and then I knew it was\nnot the lion but this stranger who had already spoken to me.\n\nI felt very tired, and I sank back again upon the pillow. What did it\nall mean? Where was I? Where had I been? I asked myself this in a vague\nsleepy sort of way, but I was too tired to say it aloud, and before I\ncould make up my mind to try I fell asleep again.\n\nThe room seemed lighter the next time I opened my eyes. It was in fact\nnearly the middle of the day, and a fine day--as clear as it ever was in\nGreat Mexington. I felt much better and less tired now, almost quite\nwell, except for a slight pain in my throat which told me I must have\ncaught cold, as my colds generally began in my throat.\n\n\"I wonder if it was with riding so far in the night,\" I first said to\nmyself, with a confused remembrance of my wonderful dream. \"I didn't\nfeel at all cold on the lion's back, and in the garden it was lovelily\nwarm.\"\n\nThen, as my waking senses quite returned, I started. It had been only a\ndream--oh dear, oh dear! But still, _something_ had happened--I was\ncertainly not in my little bed in the corner of the room I shared with\nEmma and Harriet Smith at Green Bank. When had my dream begun, or was I\nstill dreaming?\n\nI raised myself a little, very softly, for now I began to remember the\ngood-humoured face in the frilled cap, and I thought to myself that\nunless its owner were a dream too, perhaps she was still in the room,\nand I wanted to look about me first on my own account.\n\nWhat there was to see was very pleasant and very real. I felt quite sure\nI was not dreaming now, wherever I was. It was a large old-fashioned\nroom, with red curtains at the two windows and handsome dark wood\nfurniture. There was a fire burning cheerfully in the grate and the\nwindows looked very clean, even though there was a prospect of\nchimney-tops to be seen out of the one nearest to me, which told me I\nwas still in a town. And then I began to distinguish sounds outside,\nthough here in this room it was so still. There were lots of wheels\npassing, some going quickly, some lumbering along with heavy\nslowness--it was much noisier than at Miss Ledbury's or at my own old\nhome. Here I seemed to be in the very heart of a town. I began to recall\nthe events of the day before more clearly. Yes, up to the time I\nremembered leaning against the carved lion in Mr. Cranston's show-room\nall had been real, I felt certain. I recollected with a little shiver\nthe scene in the drawing-room at Green Bank, and how they had all\nrefused to believe I was speaking the truth when I declared that the\nFrench poetry had entirely gone out of my head. And then there was the\nmaking up my mind that I could bear school no longer, and the secretly\nleaving the house, and at last losing my way in the streets.\n\nI had meant to go to Mrs. Selwood's, or at least to get her address and\nwrite to her--but where was I now?--what should I do?\n\nMy head grew dizzy again with trying to think, and a faint miserable\nfeeling came over me and I burst into tears.\n\nI did not cry loudly. But there was some one watching in the room who\nwould have heard even a fainter sound than that of my sobs--some one\nsitting behind my bed-curtains whom I had not seen, who came forward\nnow and leant over me, saying, in words and voice which seemed curiously\nfamiliar to me,\n\n\"Geraldine, my poor little girl.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. KIND FRIENDS.\n\n\nIt was Miss Fenmore. I knew her again at once. And she called me \"my\npoor little girl\"--the very words she had used when she said good-bye to\nme and looked so sorry before she went away for the Easter holidays,\nnever to come back, though she did not then know it, to Green Bank.\n\n\"You remember me, dear?\" she said, in the sweet tones I had loved to\nhear. \"Don't speak if you feel too ill or if it tires you. But don't\nfeel frightened or unhappy, though you are in a strange\nplace--everything will be right.\"\n\nI felt soothed almost at once, but my curiosity grew greater.\n\n\"When did you come?\" I said. \"You weren't here when I woke before. It\nwas--somebody with a cap--first I thought it was one of the lions.\"\n\nThe sound of my own voice surprised me, it was so feeble and husky, and\nthough my throat did not hurt me much I felt that it was thick and\nswollen.\n\nMiss Fenmore thought I was still only half awake or light-headed, but\nshe was too sensible to show that she thought so.\n\n\"One of the lions?\" she said, smiling. \"You mean the carved lions that\nMyra is so fond of. No--that was a very funny fancy of yours--a lion\nwith a cap on! It was old Hannah that you saw, the old nurse. She has\nbeen watching beside you all night. When you awoke before, I was out. I\nwent out very early.\"\n\nShe spoke in a very matter-of-fact way, but rather slowly, as if she\nwanted to be sure of my understanding what she said. And as my mind\ncleared and I followed her words I grew more and more anxious to know\nall there was to hear.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said, \"and it hurts me to speak. Is this your\nhouse, Miss Fenmore, and how do you know about the lions? And who\nbrought me in here, and why didn't I know when I was put in this bed?\"\n\nMiss Fenmore looked at me rather anxiously when I said it hurt me to\nspeak. But she seemed pleased, too, at my asking the questions so\ndistinctly.\n\n\"Don't speak, dear,\" she said quietly, \"and I will explain it all. The\ndoctor said you were not to speak if it hurt you.\"\n\n\"The doctor,\" I repeated. Another puzzle!\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Fenmore, \"the doctor who lives in this street--Dr.\nFallis. He knows you quite well, and you know him, don't you? Just nod\nyour head a little, instead of speaking.\"\n\nBut the doctor's name brought back too many thoughts for me to be\ncontent with only nodding my head.\n\n\"Dr. Fallis,\" I said. \"Oh, I would so like to see him. He could tell\nme----\" but I stopped. \"Mrs. Selwood's address\" I was going to say, as\nall the memories of the day before began to rush over me. \"Why didn't I\nknow when he came?\"\n\n\"You were asleep, dear, but he is coming again,\" said Miss Fenmore\nquietly. \"He was afraid you had got a sore throat by the way you\nbreathed. You must have caught cold in the evening down in the show-room\nby the lions, before they found you.\"\n\nAnd then she went on to explain it all to me. I was in Mr. Cranston's\nhouse!--up above the big show-rooms, where he and old Mrs. Cranston\nlived. They had found me fast asleep, leaning against one of the\nlions--the old porter and the boy who went round late in the evening to\nsee that all was right for the night, though when the rooms were shut up\nearlier no one had noticed me. I was so fast asleep, so utterly\nexhausted, that I had not awakened when the old man carried me up to the\nkitchen, just as the servants were about going to bed, to ask what in\nthe world was to be done with me; nor even later, when, on Miss\nFenmore's recognising me, they had undressed and settled me for the\nnight in the comfortable old-fashioned \"best bedroom,\" had I opened my\neyes or spoken.\n\nOld Hannah watched beside me all night, and quite early in the morning\nDr. Fallis, who fortunately was the Cranstons' doctor too, had been sent\nfor.\n\n\"He said we were to let you have your sleep out,\" said Miss Fenmore,\n\"though by your breathing he was afraid you had caught cold. How is your\nthroat now, dear?\"\n\n\"It doesn't hurt very much,\" I said, \"only it feels very shut up.\"\n\n\"I expect you will have to stay in bed all to-day,\" she replied. \"Dr.\nFallis will be coming soon and then we shall know.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" I began; then as the thought of it all came over me still\nmore distinctly I hid my face in the pillow and burst into tears. \"Must\nI go back to school?\" I said. \"Oh, Miss Fenmore, they will be so\nangry--I came away without leave, because--because I couldn't bear it,\nand they said I told what wasn't true--that was almost the worst of all.\nFancy if they wrote and told mamma that I told lies.\"\n\n\"She would not believe it,\" said Miss Fenmore quietly; \"and besides, I\ndon't think Miss Ledbury would do such a thing, and she always writes to\nthe parents herself, I know. And she is kind and good, Geraldine.\"\n\n\"P'raps she means to be,\" I said among my tears, \"but it's Miss Aspinall\nand--and--Miss Broom. I think I hate her, Miss Fenmore. Oh, I shouldn't\nsay that--I never used to hate anybody. I'm getting all wrong and\nnaughty, I know,\" and I burst into fresh sobs.\n\nPoor Miss Fenmore looked much distressed. No doubt she had been told to\nkeep me quiet and not let me excite myself.\n\n\"Geraldine, dear,\" she said, \"do try to be calm. If you could tell me\nall about it quietly, the speaking would do you less harm than crying\nso. Try, dear. You need not speak loud.\"\n\nI swallowed down my tears and began the story of my troubles. Once\nstarted I could not have helped telling her all, even if it had hurt my\nthroat much more than it did. And she knew a good deal already. She was\na girl of great natural quickness and full of sympathy. She seemed to\nunderstand what I had been going through far better than I could put it\nin words, and when at last, tired out, I left off speaking, she said all\nshe could to comfort me. There was no need for me to trouble about going\nback to Green Bank just now. Dr. Fallis had said I must stay where I was\nfor the present, and when I saw him I might tell him anything I liked.\n\n\"He will understand,\" she said, \"and he will explain to Miss Ledbury. I\nhave seen Miss Ledbury this morning already, and----\"\n\n\"Was she dreadfully angry?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"No, dear,\" Miss Fenmore replied. \"She had been terribly frightened\nabout you, and Miss Aspinall and some of the servants had been rushing\nabout everywhere. But Miss Ledbury is very good, as I keep telling you,\nGeraldine. She is very sorry to hear how unhappy you have been, and if\nshe had known how anxious you were about your father and mother she\nwould have tried to comfort you. I wish you had told her.\"\n\n\"I wanted to tell her, but Miss Broom was there, and they thought I told\nstories,\" I repeated.\n\n\"Well, never mind about that now. You shall ask Dr. Fallis, and I am\nsure he will tell you you need not be so unhappy.\"\n\nIt was not till long afterwards that I knew how very distressed poor old\nMiss Ledbury had been, and how she had blamed herself for not having\ntried harder to gain my confidence. Nor did I fully understand at the\ntime how very sensibly Miss Fenmore had behaved when Mr. and Mrs.\nCranston sent her off to Green Bank to tell of my having, without\nintending it, taken refuge with them; she had explained things so that\nMiss Ledbury, and indeed Miss Aspinall, felt far more sorry for me than\nangry with me.\n\nJust as Miss Fenmore mentioned his name there came a tap at the door,\nand in another moment I saw the kind well-known face of our old doctor\nlooking in.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he began, looking at me with a rather odd smile, \"and how\nis the little runaway? My dear child, why did you not come to me,\ninstead of wandering all about Great Mexington streets in the dark and\nthe rain? Not that you could have found anywhere better for yourself\nthan this kind house, but you might have been all night downstairs in\nthe cold! Tell me, what made you run away like that--no, don't tell me\njust yet. It is all right now, but I think you have talked enough. Has\nshe had anything to eat?\" and he turned to Miss Fenmore. Then he looked\nat my throat and listened to my breathing, and tapped me and felt my\npulse and looked at my tongue before I could speak at all.\n\n\"She must stay in bed all to-day,\" he said at last. \"I will see her\nagain this evening,\" and he went on to give Miss Fenmore a few\ndirections about me, I fidgeting all the time to ask him about father\nand mamma, though feeling too shy to do so.\n\n\"Geraldine is very anxious to tell you one of the chief causes of her\ncoming away from Green Bank as she did,\" said Miss Fenmore. And then she\nspoke of the gossip that had reached me through Harriet Smith about the\nterribly unhealthy climate my parents were in.\n\nDr. Fallis listened attentively.\n\n\"I wanted to write to Mrs. Selwood, and I thought Mr. Cranston would\ntell me her address,\" I said, though I almost started when I heard how\nhoarse and husky my voice sounded. \"Can you tell it me? I do so want to\nwrite to her.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Selwood is abroad, my dear, and not returning till next month,\"\nsaid Dr. Fallis; but when he saw how my face fell, he added quickly,\n\"but I think I can tell you perhaps better than she about your parents.\nI know the place--Mr. Le Marchant consulted me about it before he\ndecided on going, as he knew I had been there myself in my young days.\nUnhealthy? No, not if people take proper care. Your father and mother\nlive in the best part--on high ground out of the town--there is never\nany fever there. And I had a most cheerful letter from your father quite\nlately. Put all these fears out of your head, my poor child. Please God\nyou will have papa and mamma safe home again before long. But they must\nnot find such a poor little white shrimp of a daughter when they come.\nYou must get strong and well and do all that this kind young lady tells\nyou to do. Good-bye--good-bye,\" and he hurried off.\n\nI was crying again by this time, but quietly now, and my tears were not\naltogether because I was weak and ill. They were in great measure tears\nof relief--I was so thankful to hear what he said about father and\nmamma.\n\n\"Miss Fenmore,\" I whispered, \"I wonder why they didn't take me with\nthem, if it's a nice place. And then there wouldn't have been all these\ndreadful things.\"\n\n\"It is quite a different matter to take a child to a hot climate,\" she\nsaid. \"Grown-up people can stand much that would be very bad for girls\nand boys. When I was little my father was in India, and my sister and I\nhad to be brought up by an aunt in England.\"\n\n\"Did you mind?\" I said eagerly. \"And did your papa soon come home? And\nwhere was your mamma?\"\n\nMiss Fenmore smiled, but there was something a little sad in her smile.\n\n\"I was very happy with my aunt,\" she said; \"she was like a mother to me.\nFor my mother died when I was a little baby. Yes, my father has been\nhome several times, but he is in India again now, and he won't be able\nto come back for good till he is quite old. So you have much happier\nthings to look forward to, you see, Geraldine.\"\n\nThat was true. I felt very sorry for Miss Fenmore as I lay thinking\nover what she had been telling me. Then another idea struck me.\n\n\"Is Mrs. Cranston your aunt?\" I said. \"Is that why you are living here?\"\n\nMiss Fenmore looked up quickly.\n\n\"No,\" she replied; \"I thought somehow that you understood. I am here\nbecause I am Myra Raby's governess--Myra Raby, who used to come for some\nlessons to Green Bank.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed. This explained several things. \"Oh yes,\" I went on,\n\"I remember her, and I know she's Mr. Cranston's grand-daughter--he was\nspeaking of her to mamma one day. I should like to see her, Miss\nFenmore. May I?\"\n\nMiss Fenmore was just going to reply when again there came a tap at the\ndoor, and in answer to her \"Come in\" it opened and two figures appeared.\n\nI could see them from where I lay, and I shall never forget the pretty\npicture they made. Myra I knew by sight, and as I think I have said\nbefore, she was an unusually lovely child. And with her was a quite old\nlady, a small old lady--Myra was nearly as tall as she--with a face that\neven I (though children seldom notice beauty in elderly people) saw was\nquite charming. This was Mrs. Cranston.\n\nI felt quite surprised. Mr. Cranston was a rather stout old man, with\nspectacles and a big nose. I had not thought him at all \"pretty,\" and\nsomehow I had fancied Mrs. Cranston must be something like him, and I\ngave a sigh of pleasure as the old lady came up to the side of the bed\nwith a gentle smile on her face.\n\n\"Dr. Fallis gave us leave to come in to see you, my dear,\" she said.\n\"Myra has been longing to do so all the morning.\"\n\n\"I've been wanting to see her too,\" I said, half shyly.\n\"And--please--it's very kind of you to let me stay here in this nice\nroom. I didn't mean to fall asleep downstairs. I only wanted to speak to\nMr. Cranston.\"\n\n\"I'm sure Mr. Cranston would be very pleased to tell you anything he can\nthat you want to know, my dear. But I think you mustn't trouble just now\nabout anything except getting quite well,\" said the old lady. \"Myra has\nbeen wanting to come to see you all the morning, but we were afraid of\ntiring you.\"\n\n[MYRA CAME FORWARD GENTLY, HER SWEET FACE LOOKING RATHER\nGRAVE.]\n\nMyra came forward gently, her sweet face looking rather grave. I put out\nmy hand, and she smiled.\n\n\"May she stay with me a little?\" I asked Mrs. Cranston.\n\n\"Of course she may--that's what she came for,\" said the grandmother\nheartily. \"But I don't think you should talk much. Missie's voice sounds\nas if it hurt her to speak,\" she went on, turning to Miss Fenmore.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt me much,\" I said. \"I daresay I shall be quite well\nto-morrow. I am so glad I'm here--I wouldn't have liked to be ill at\nschool,\" and I gave a little shudder. \"I'm quite happy now that Dr.\nFallis says it's not true about father and mamma getting ill at that\nplace, and I don't want to ask Mr. Cranston anything now, thank you. It\nwas about Mrs. Selwood, but I don't mind now.\"\n\nI had been sitting up a little--now I laid my head down on the pillows\nagain with a little sigh, half of weariness, half of relief.\n\nMrs. Cranston looked at me rather anxiously.\n\n\"Are you very tired, my dear?\" she said. \"Perhaps it would be better for\nMyra not to stay just now.\"\n\n\"Oh, please let her stay,\" I said; \"I like to see her.\"\n\nSo Myra sat down beside my bed and took hold of my hand, and though we\ndid not speak to each other, I liked the feeling of her being there.\n\nMrs. Cranston left the room then, and Miss Fenmore followed her. I\nthink the old lady had made her a little sign to do so, though I did not\nsee it. Afterwards I found out that Mrs. Cranston had thought me looking\nvery ill, worse than she had expected, and she wanted to hear from Miss\nFenmore if it was natural to me to look so pale.\n\nI myself, though feeling tired and disinclined to talk, was really\nhappier than I had been for a very long time. There was a delightful\nsensation of being safe and at home, even though the kind people who had\ntaken me in, like a poor little stray bird, were strangers. The very\nlook of the old-fashioned room and the comfortable great big four-post\nbed made me hug myself when I thought how different it all was from the\nbare cold room at Green Bank, where there had never once been a fire all\nthe weeks I was there. It reminded me of something--what was it? Oh yes,\nin a minute or two I remembered. It was the room I had once slept in\nwith mamma at grandmamma's house in London, several years before, when I\nwas quite a little girl. For dear grandmamma had died soon after we came\nto live at Great Mexington. But there was the same comfortable\nold-fashioned feeling: red curtains to the window and the bed, and a big\nfire and the shiny dark mahogany furniture. Oh yes, how well I\nremembered it, and how enormous the bed seemed, and how mamma tucked me\nin at night and left the door a little open in case I should feel lonely\nbefore she came to bed. It all came back to me so that I forgot where I\nwas for the moment, till I felt a little tug given to the hand that Myra\nwas still holding, and heard her voice say very softly,\n\n\"Are you going to sleep, Geraldine?\"\n\nThis brought me back to the present.\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said, \"I'm not sleepy. I was only thinking,\" and I told her\nwhat had come into my mind.\n\nShe listened with great interest.\n\n\"How unhappy you must have been when your mamma went away,\" she said. \"I\ncan't remember my own mamma, but mother\"--she meant her stepmother--\"is\nso kind, and granny is so sweet. I've never been lonely.\"\n\n\"You can't fancy what it's like,\" I said. \"It wasn't only mamma's going\naway; I know Haddie--that's my brother--loves her as much as I do, but\nhe's not very unhappy, because he likes his school. Oh, Myra, what\n_shall_ I do when I have to go back to school? I'd rather be ill always.\nDo you think I'll have to go back to-morrow?\"\n\nMyra looked most sympathising and concerned.\n\n\"I don't think you'll be quite well to-morrow,\" was the best comfort she\ncould give me. \"When I have bad colds and sore throats they always last\nlonger than one day.\"\n\n\"I'd like to talk a great lot to keep my throat from getting quite\nwell,\" I said, \"but I suppose that would be very naughty.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Myra with conviction, \"I'm sure it would be. You really\nmustn't talk, Geraldine; granny said so. Mayn't I read aloud to you?\nI've brought a book with me--it's an old story-book of mamma's that she\nhad when she was a little girl. Granny keeps them here all together.\nThis one is called _Ornaments Discovered_.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"Yes, I should like it very much.\"\n\nAnd in her gentle little voice Myra read the quaint old story aloud to\nme. It was old-fashioned even then, for the book had belonged to her\nmother, if not in the first place to her grandmother. How very old-world\nit would seem to the children of to-day--I wonder if any of you know it?\nFor I am growing quite an old woman myself, and the little history of my\nchildhood that I am telling you will, before long, be half a century in\nage, though its events seem as clear and distinct to me as if they had\nonly happened quite recently! I came across the little red gilt-leaved\nbook not long ago in the house of one of Myra's daughters, and with the\nsight of it a whole flood of memories rushed over me.\n\nIt was not a very exciting story, but I found it very interesting, and\nnow and then my little friend stopped to talk about it, which I found\nvery interesting too. I was quite sorry when Miss Fenmore, who had come\nback to the room and was sitting quietly sewing, told Myra that she\nthought she had read enough, and that it must be near dinner-time.\n\n\"I will come again after dinner,\" said Myra, and then I whispered\nsomething to her. She nodded; she quite understood me. What I said was\nthis:\n\n\"I wish you would go downstairs and tell the carved lions that they made\nme very happy last night, and I _am_ so glad they brought me back here\nto you, instead of taking me to Green Bank.\"\n\n\"Where did they take you to in the night?\" said Myra with great\ninterest, though not at all as if she thought I was talking nonsense.\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it afterwards,\" I said. \"It was beautiful. But\nit would take a long time to tell, and I'm rather tired.\"\n\n\"You are looking tired, dear,\" said Miss Fenmore, who heard my last\nwords, as she gave me a cupful of beef-tea. \"Try to go to sleep for a\nlittle, and then Myra can come to sit with you again.\"\n\nI did go to sleep, but Myra was not allowed to see me again that day,\nnor the next--nor for several days after, except for a very few minutes\nat a time. For I did not improve as the kind people about me had hoped I\nwould, and Dr. Fallis looked graver when he came that evening than he\nhad done in the morning. Miss Fenmore was afraid she had let me talk too\nmuch, but after all I do not think anything would have made any great\ndifference. I had really been falling out of health for months past, and\nI should probably have got ill in some other way if I had not caught\ncold in my wanderings. I do not very clearly remember those days of\nserious illness. I knew whenever I was awake that I was being tenderly\ncared for, and in the half-dozing, half-dreaming state in which many\nhours must have been passed, I fancied more than once that mamma was\nbeside me, which made me very happy. And though never actually\ndelirious, I had very strange though not unpleasant dreams, especially\nabout the carved lions; none of them, however, so clear and real as the\none I related at full in the last chapter.\n\nOn the whole, that illness left more peaceful and sweet memories than\nmemories of pain. Through it all I had the delightful feeling of being\ncared for and protected, and somehow it all seemed to have to do with\nthe pair of lions downstairs in Mr. Cranston's show-room!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. GOOD NEWS.\n\n\nI don't suppose there was anything really infectious about my illness,\nthough nowadays whenever there is any sort of sore throat people are\nvery much on their guard. Perhaps they were not so cautious long ago.\nHowever that may have been, Myra was not banished from my room for very\nlong. I rather think, indeed, that she used to creep in and sit like a\nlittle mouse behind the curtains before I was well enough to notice her.\n\nBut everything for a time seemed dreamy to me. The first event I can\nquite clearly recall was my being allowed to sit up for an hour or two,\nor, more correctly speaking, to _lie_ up, for I was lifted on to the\nsofa and tucked in almost as if I were still in bed.\n\nThat was a very happy afternoon. It was happy for several reasons, for\nthat morning had brought me the first letter I had had from dear mamma\nsince she had heard of my bold step in running away from school! Lying\nstill and silent for so many hours as I had done, things had grown to\nlook differently to me. I began to see where and how I had been wrong,\nand to think that if I had been more open about my troubles, more\ncourageous--that is to say, if I had gone to Miss Ledbury and told her\neverything that was on my mind--I need not have been so terribly unhappy\nor caused trouble and distress to others.\n\nA little of this mamma pointed out to me in her letter, which was,\nhowever, so very kind and loving, so full of sorrow that I had been so\nunhappy, that I felt more grateful than I knew how to express.\nAfterwards, when we talked it all over, years afterwards even, for we\noften talked of that time after I was grown up and married, and had\nchildren of my own, mamma said to me that she _could_ not blame me\nthough she knew I had not done right, for she felt so broken-hearted at\nthe thought of what I had suffered.\n\nIt had been a mistake, no doubt, to send me to Green Bank, but mistakes\nare often overruled for good. I am glad to have had the experience of\nit, as I think it made me more sympathising with others. And it made me\ndetermine never to send any child of mine, or any child I had the care\nof, to a school where there was so little feeling of _home_, so little\naffection and gentleness--above all, that dreadful old-world rule of\nletters being read, and the want of trust and confidence in the pupils,\nwhich showed in so many ways.\n\nA few days after I received mamma's letter I was allowed to write to\nher. It was slow and tiring work, for I was only able to write a few\nlines at a time, and that in pencil. But it was delightful to be free to\nsay just what I wanted to say, without the terrible feeling of Miss\nAspinall, or worse still Miss Broom, judging and criticising every line.\nI thanked mamma with my whole heart for not being angry with me, and to\nshow her how truly I meant what I said, I promised her that when I was\nwell again and able to go back to school I would try my very, very best\nto get on more happily.\n\nBut I gave a deep sigh as I wrote this, and Myra, who was sitting beside\nme, looked up anxiously, and asked what was the matter.\n\n\"Oh, Myra,\" I said, \"it is just that I can't bear to think of going back\nto school. I'd rather never get well if only I could stay here till\nmamma comes home.\"\n\n\"Dear little Geraldine,\" said Myra--she often called me \"little\" though\nshe was _scarcely_ any taller than I--\"dear little Geraldine, you\nmustn't say that. I don't think it's right. And, you know, when you are\nquite well again things won't seem so bad to you. I remember once when I\nwas ill--I was quite a little girl then,\"--Myra spoke as if she was now\na very big girl indeed!--\"I think it was when I had had the measles, the\nleast thing vexed me dreadfully. I cried because somebody had given me a\npresent of a set of wooden tea-things in a box, and the tea ran out of\nthe cups when I filled them! Fancy crying for that!\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said, \"I've felt like that too. But this is a _real_\ntrouble, Myra--a real, very bad, dreadful trouble, though I've promised\nmamma to try to be good. Do you think, Myra, that when I'm back at\nschool your grandmamma will sometimes ask me to come to see you?\"\n\n\"I'm sure----\" my little friend began eagerly. But she was interrupted.\nFor curiously enough, just at that moment Mrs. Cranston opened the door\nand came in. She came to see me every day, and though at first I was\njust a tiny bit afraid of her--she seemed to me such a very old lady--I\nsoon got to love her dearly, and to talk to her quite as readily as to\nkind Miss Fenmore.\n\n\"What is my little girl sure about?\" she said. \"And how is my other\nlittle girl to-day? Not too tired,\" and she glanced at my letter. \"You\nhave not been writing too much, dearie, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" I replied, \"I'm not tired.\"\n\n\"She's only rather unhappy, granny,\" said Myra.\n\n\"I think that's a very big 'only,'\" said Mrs. Cranston. \"Can't you tell\nme, my dear, what you are unhappy about?\"\n\nI glanced at Myra, as if asking her to speak for me. She understood.\n\n\"Granny,\" she said, \"poor little Geraldine is unhappy to think of going\naway and going back to school.\"\n\nMrs. Cranston looked at me very kindly.\n\n\"Poor dear,\" she said, \"you have not had much pleasure with us, as you\nhave been ill all the time.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" I said. \"I was telling Myra, only she thought it was\nnaughty, that I'd rather be ill always if I was with kind people,\nthan--than--be at school where nobody cares for me.\"\n\n\"Well, well, my dear, the troubles we dread are often those that don't\ncome to pass. Try to keep up your spirits and get quite well and\nstrong, so that you may be able to enjoy yourself a little before both\nyou and Myra leave us.\"\n\n\"Oh, is Myra going away?\" I said. \"I thought she was going to live here\nalways,\" and somehow I felt as if I did not mind _quite_ so much to\nthink of going away myself in that case.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said the old lady, \"Myra has her own home where she must spend\npart of her time, though grandfather and I hope to have her here a good\ndeal too. It is easy to manage now Miss Fenmore is with her always.\"\n\nIn my heart I thought Myra a most fortunate child--_two_ homes were\nreally hers; and I--I had none. This thought made me sigh again. I don't\nknow if Myra guessed what I was thinking of, but she came close up to me\nand put her arms round my neck and kissed me.\n\n\"Geraldine,\" she whispered, by way of giving me something pleasant to\nthink of, perhaps, \"as soon as you are able to walk about a little I\nwant you to come downstairs with me to see the lions.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said in the same tone, \"but you did give them my message,\nMyra?\"\n\n\"Of course I did, and they sent you back their love, and they are very\nglad you're better, and they want you very much indeed to come to see\nthem.\"\n\nMyra and I understood each other quite well about the lions, you see.\n\nI went on getting well steadily after that, and not many days later I\nwent downstairs with Myra to the big show-room to see the lions. It gave\nme such a curious feeling to remember the last time I had been there,\nthat rainy evening when I crept in, as nearly broken-hearted and in\ndespair as a little girl could be. And as I stroked the lions and looked\nup in their dark mysterious faces, I could not get rid of the idea that\nthey knew all about it, that somehow or other they had helped and\nprotected me, and when I tried to express this to Myra she seemed to\nthink the same.\n\nAfter this there were not many days on which we did not come downstairs\nto visit our strange play-fellows, and not a few interesting games or\n\"actings,\" as Myra called them, did we invent, in which the lions took\ntheir part.\n\nWe were only allowed to be in the show-rooms at certain hours of the\nday, when there were not likely to be any customers there. Dear old Mrs.\nCranston was as particular as she possibly could be not to let me do\nanything or be seen in any way which mamma could possibly have disliked.\n\nAnd before long I began to join a little in Myra's lessons with Miss\nFenmore--lessons which our teacher's kind and \"understanding\" ways made\ndelightful. So that life was really very happy for me at this time,\nexcept of course for the longing for mamma and father and Haddie, which\nstill came over me in fits, as it were, every now and then, and\nexcept--a still bigger \"except\"--for the dreaded thought of the return\nto school which must be coming nearer day by day.\n\nMyra and I never spoke of it. I tried to forget about it, and she seemed\nto enter into my feeling without saying anything.\n\nI had had a letter from mamma in answer to the one I wrote to her just\nafter my illness. In it she said she was pleased with all I said, and my\npromise to try to get on better at Green Bank, but \"in the meantime,\"\nshe wrote, \"what we want you to do is to get _quite_ strong and well, so\nput all troubling thoughts out of your head and be happy with your kind\nfriends.\"\n\nThat letter had come a month ago, and the last mail had only brought me\na tiny little note enclosed in a letter from mamma to Mrs. Cranston,\nwith the promise of a longer one \"next time.\" And \"next time\" was about\ndue, for the mail came every fortnight, one afternoon when Myra and I\nwere sitting together in our favourite nook in the show-room.\n\n\"I have a fancy, Myra,\" I said, \"that something is going to happen. My\nlion has been so queer to-day--I see a look on his face as if he knew\nsomething.\"\n\nFor we had each chosen one lion as more particularly our own.\n\n\"I think they always look rather like that,\" said Myra dreamily. \"But I\nsuppose something must happen soon. I shall be going home next week.\"\n\n\"Next week,\" I repeated. \"Oh, Myra!\"\n\nI could not speak for a moment. Then I remembered how I had made up my\nmind to be brave.\n\n\"Do you mind going home?\" I asked. \"I mean, are you sorry to go?\"\n\n\"I'm always sorry to leave grandpapa and grandmamma,\" she said, \"and the\nlions, and this funny old house. But I'm very happy at home, and I shall\nlike it still better with Miss Fenmore. No, I wouldn't be unhappy--I'd\nbe very glad to think of seeing father and mother and my little brothers\nagain--I wouldn't be unhappy, except for--you know, Geraldine--for\nleaving you,\" and my little friend's voice shook.\n\n\"Dear Myra,\" I said. \"But you mustn't mind about me. I'm going to\ntry----\" but here I had to stop to choke down something in my throat.\n\"After all,\" I went on, after a moment or two, \"more than a quarter of\nthe time that father and mamma have to be away is gone. And perhaps in\nthe summer holidays I shall see Haddie.\"\n\n\"I wish----\" Myra was beginning, but a voice interrupted her. It was\nMiss Fenmore's.\n\n\"I have brought you down a letter that has just come by the second post,\nGeraldine, dear,\" she said; \"a letter from South America.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" I said, eagerly seizing it.\n\nMiss Fenmore strolled to the other side of the room, and Myra followed\nher, to leave me alone to read my letter. It was a pretty long one, but\nI read it quickly, so quickly that when I had finished it, I felt\nbreathless--and then I turned over the pages and glanced at it again. I\nfelt as if I could not believe what I read. It was too good, too\nbeautifully good to be true.\n\n\"Myra,\" I gasped, and Myra ran back to me, looking quite startled. I\nthink I must have grown very pale.\n\n\"No, no,\" I went on, \"it's nothing wrong. Read it, or ask Miss\nFenmore--she reads writing quicker. Oh, Myra, isn't it beautiful?\"\n\nThey soon read it, and then we all three kissed and hugged each other,\nand Myra began dancing about as if she had gone out of her mind.\n\n\"Geraldine, Geraldine, I can't believe it,\" she kept saying, and Miss\nFenmore's pretty eyes were full of tears.\n\nI wonder if any of my readers can guess what this delightful news was?\nIt was not that mamma was coming home--no, that could not be yet. But\nnext best to that it certainly was.\n\nIt was to tell me this--that _till_ dear father and she returned, my\nhome was to be with Myra, and I was to be Miss Fenmore's pupil too.\nWherever Myra was, there I was to be--principally at her father's\nvicarage in the country, but some part of the year with her kind\ngrandparents at Great Mexington. It was all settled and arranged--of\ncourse I did not trouble my head about the money part of it, though\nafterwards mamma told me that both Mr. and Mrs. Raby and the Cranstons\nhad been most exceedingly kind, making out that the advantage of a\ncompanion for their little girl would be so great that all the thanking\nshould be on their side, though, of course, they respected father too\nmuch not to let him pay a proper share of all the expense. And it really\ncost less than my life at Green Bank, though father was now a good deal\nricher, and would not have minded paying a good deal more to ensure my\nhappiness.\n\nThere is never so much story to tell when people are happy, and things\ngo rightly; and the next year or two of my life, except of course for\nthe separation from my dear parents, were _very_ happy. Even though\nfather's appointment in South America kept him and mamma out there for\nnearly three years instead of two, I was able to bear the disappointment\nin a very different way, with such kind and sympathising friends at hand\nto cheer me, so that there is nothing bitter or sad to look back to in\nthat part of my childhood. Haddie spent the summer holidays with me,\neither at Crowley vicarage, or sometimes at the sea-side, where Miss\nFenmore took care of us three. Once or twice he and I paid a visit to\nMrs. Selwood, which we enjoyed pretty well, as we were together, though\notherwise it was rather dull.\n\nAnd oh, how happy it was when father and mamma at last came home--no\nwords can describe it. It was not _quite_ unmixed pleasure--nothing ever\nis, the wise folk say--for there was the separation from Myra and her\nfamily. But after all, that turned out less than we feared. Miss Fenmore\nmarried soon after, and as father had now a good post in London, and we\nlived there, it was settled that Myra should be with us, and join in my\nlessons for a good part of the year, while I very often went back to\nCrowley with her for the summer holidays. And never without staying a\nfew days at Great Mexington, to see Mr. and Mrs. Cranston and the lions!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMany years have passed since I went there for the last time. Myra's\ngrandparents have long been dead--my own dear father and mother are dead\ntoo, for I am growing quite old. My grandchildren are older now than I\nwas when I ran away from the school at Green Bank. But once, while mamma\nwas still alive and well, she and I together strolled through the\nstreets of the grim town, which had for a time been our home, and lived\nover the old days again in fancy. I remember how tightly I clasped her\nhand when we passed the corner where once was the old Quakeress's\nshop--all changed now--and walked down the street, still not very\ndifferent from what it had been, where we used to live.\n\nThere was no use in going to Mr. Cranston's show-rooms--they had long\nbeen done away with. But the lions are still to be seen. They stand in\nthe hall of Myra's pretty house in the country, where she and Haddon,\nher husband, have lived for many years, ever since my brother left the\narmy and they came home for good from India.\n\nI spend a part of every year with them, for I am alone now. They want me\nto live with them altogether, but I cling to a little home of my own.\nOur grandchildren know the lions well, and stroke their smooth sides,\nand gaze up into their dark faces just as Myra and I used to do. So I\npromised them that sometime I would write out the simple story that I\nhave now brought to a close.\n\n\nTHE END.\n",
