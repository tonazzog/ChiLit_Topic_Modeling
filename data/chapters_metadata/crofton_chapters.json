  "content": "The Crofton Boys\nHarriet Martineau\n\nCHAPTER 1. ALL THE PROCTORS BUT PHIL.\n\nMr Proctor, the chemist and druggist, kept his shop, and lived in the\nStrand, London.  His children thought that there was never anything\npleasanter than the way they lived.  Their house was warm in winter, and\nsuch a little distance from the church, that they had no difficulty in\ngetting to church and back again, in the worst weather, before their\nshoes were wet.  They were also conveniently near to Covent Garden\nmarket; so that, if any friend dropped in to dinner unexpectedly, Jane\nand Agnes could be off to the market, and buy a fowl, or some vegetables\nor fruit, and be back again before they were missed.  It was not even\ntoo far for little Harry to trot with one of his sisters, early on a\nsummer's morning, to spend his penny (when he happened to have one) on a\nbunch of flowers, to lay on papa's plate, to surprise him when he came\nin to breakfast.  Not much farther off was the Temple Garden, where Mrs\nProctor took her children every fine summer evening to walk and breathe\nthe air from the river; and when Mr Proctor could find time to come to\nthem for a turn or two before the younger ones must go home to bed, it\nseemed to the whole party the happiest and most beautiful place in the\nwhole world,--except one.  They had once been to Broadstairs, when the\nchildren were in poor health after the measles: and for ever after, when\nthey thought of the waves beating on the shore, and of the pleasures of\ngrowing strong and well among the sea-breezes, they felt that there\nmight be places more delightful than the Temple Garden: but they were\nstill very proud and fond of the grass and trees, and the gravel walks,\nand the view over the Thames, and were pleased to show off the garden to\nall friends from the country who came to visit them.\n\nThe greatest privilege of all, however, was that they could see the\nriver without going out of their own house.  There were three back\nwindows to the house, one above another; and from the two uppermost of\nthese windows there was what the children called a view of the Thames.\nThere was a gap of a few yards wide between two high brick houses: and\nthrough this gap might be seen the broad river, with vessels of every\nkind passing up or down.  Outside the second window were some leads,\naffording space for three or four chairs: and here it was that Jane and\nAgnes liked to sit at work, on certain hours of fine days.  There were\ntimes when these leads were too hot, the heat of the sun being reflected\nfrom the surrounding brick walls; but at an earlier hour before the\nshadows were gone, and when the air blew in from the river, the place\nwas cool, and the little girls delighted to carry their stools to the\nleads, and do their sewing there.  There Philip would condescend to\nspend a part of his mornings, in his Midsummer holidays, frightening his\nsisters with climbing about in dangerous places, or amusing them with\nstories of school pranks, or raising his younger brother Hugh's envy of\nthe boys who were so happy as to be old enough to go to school at Mr\nTooke's, at Crofton.\n\nThe girls had no peace from their brothers climbing about in dangerous\nplaces.  Hugh was, if possible, worse than Philip for this.  He imitated\nall Philip's feats, and had some of his own besides.  In answer to\nJane's lectures and the entreaties of Agnes, Hugh always declared that\nhe had a right to do such things, as he meant to be a soldier or a\nsailor; and how should he be able to climb the mast of a ship, or the\nwalls of a city, if he did not begin to practise now?  Agnes was almost\nsorry they had been to Broadstairs, and could see ships in the Thames,\nwhen she considered that, if Hugh had not seen so much of the world, he\nmight have been satisfied to be apprenticed to his father, when old\nenough, and to have lived at home happily with his family.  Jane advised\nAgnes not to argue with Hugh, and then perhaps his wish to rove about\nthe world might go off.  She had heard her father say that, when he was\na boy, and used to bring home news of victories, and help to put up\ncandles at the windows on illumination nights, he had a great fancy for\nbeing a soldier; but that it was his fortune to see some soldiers from\nSpain, and hear from them what war really was, just when peace came, and\nwhen there was no more glory to be got; so that he had happily settled\ndown to be a London shop-keeper--a lot which he would not exchange with\nthat of any man living.  Hugh was very like papa, Jane added; and the\nsame change might take place in his mind, if he was not made perverse by\nargument.  So Agnes only sighed, and bent her head closer over her work,\nas she heard Hugh talk of the adventures he meant to have when he should\nbe old enough to get away from Old England.\n\nThere was one person that laughed at Hugh for this fancy of his;--Miss\nHarold, the daily governess, who came to keep school for three hours\nevery morning.  When Hugh forgot his lesson, and sat staring at the\nupper panes of the window, in a reverie about his future travels; or\nwhen he was found to have been drawing a soldier on his slate instead of\ndoing his sum, Miss Harold reminded him what a pretty figure a soldier\nwould cut who knew no geography, or a sailor who could not make his\nreckonings, for want of attending early to his arithmetic Hugh could not\ndeny this; but he was always wishing that school-hours were over, that\nhe might get under the great dining table to read Robinson Crusoe, or\nmight play at shipwreck, under pretence of amusing little Harry.  It did\nmake him ashamed to see how his sisters got on, from the mere pleasure\nof learning, and without any idea of ever living anywhere but in London;\nwhile he, who seemed to have so much more reason for wanting the very\nknowledge that they were obtaining, could not settle his mind to his\nlessons.  Jane was beginning to read French books for her amusement in\nleisure hours; and Agnes was often found to have covered two slates with\nsums in Practice, just for pleasure, while he could not master the very\nmoderate lessons Miss Harold set him.  It is true, he was two years\nyounger than Agnes: but she had known more of everything that he had\nlearned, at seven years old, than he now did at eight.  Hugh began to\nfeel very unhappy.  He saw that Miss Harold was dissatisfied, and was\npretty sure that she had spoken to his mother about him.  He felt that\nhis mother became more strict in making him sit down beside her, in the\nafternoon, to learn his lessons for the next day; and he was pretty sure\nthat Agnes went out of the room because she could not help crying when\nhis sum was found to be all wrong, or when he mistook his tenses, or\nwhen he said (as he did every day, though regularly warned to mind what\nhe was about) that four times seven is fifty-six.  Every day these\nthings weighed more on Hugh's spirits; every day he felt more and more\nlike a dunce; and when Philip came home for the Midsummer holidays, and\ntold all manner of stories about all sorts of boys at school, without\ndescribing anything like Hugh's troubles with Miss Harold, Hugh was\nseized with a longing to go to Crofton at once, as he was certainly too\nyoung to go at present into the way of a shipwreck or a battle.  The\nworst of it was, there was no prospect of his going yet to Crofton.  In\nMr Tooke's large school there was not one boy younger than ten; and\nPhilip believed that Mr Tooke did not like to take little boys.  Hugh\nwas aware that his father and mother meant to send him to school with\nPhilip by-and-by; but the idea of having to wait--to do his lessons with\nMiss Harold every day till he should be ten years old, made him roll\nhimself on the parlour carpet in despair.\n\nPhilip was between eleven and twelve.  He was happy at school: and he\nliked to talk all about it at home.  These holidays, Hugh made a better\nlistener than even his sisters; and he was a more amusing one--he knew\nso little about the country.  He asked every question that could be\nimagined about the playground at the Crofton school, and the boys'\ndoings out of school; and then, when Philip fancied he must know all\nabout what was done, out came some odd remark which showed what wrong\nnotions he had formed of a country life.  Hugh had not learned half that\nhe wanted to know, and his little head was full of wonder and mysterious\nnotions, when the holidays came to an end, and Philip had to go away.\nFrom that day Hugh was heard to talk less of Spain, and the sea, and\ndesert islands, and more of the Crofton boys; and his play with little\nHarry was all of being at school.  At his lessons, meantime, he did not\nimprove at all.\n\nOne very warm day, at the end of August, five weeks after Philip had\nreturned to school, Miss Harold had stayed full ten minutes after twelve\no'clock to hear Hugh say one line of the multiplication-table over and\nover again, to cure him of saying that four times seven is fifty-six;\nbut all in vain: and Mrs Proctor had pegged her not to spend any more\ntime to-day upon it.\n\nMiss Harold went away, the girls took their sewing, and sat down at\ntheir mother's work-table, while Hugh was placed before her, with his\nhands behind his back, and desired to look his mother full in the face,\nto begin again with \"four times one is four,\" and go through the line,\ntaking care what he was about.  He did so; but before he came to four\ntimes seven, he sighed, fidgetted, looked up at the corners of the room,\noff into the work-basket, out into the street, and always, as if by a\nspell, finished with \"four times seven is fifty-six.\"  Jane looked up\namazed--Agnes looked down ashamed; his mother looked with severity in\nhis face.  He began the line a fourth time, when, at the third figure,\nhe started as if he had been shot.  It was only a knock at the door that\nhe had heard; a treble knock, which startled nobody else, though, from\nthe parlour-door being open, it sounded pretty loud.\n\nMrs Proctor spread a handkerchief over the stockings in her\nwork-basket; Jane put back a stray curl which had fallen over her face;\nAgnes lifted up her head with a sigh, as if relieved that the\nmultiplication-table must stop for this time; and Hugh gazed into the\npassage, through the open door, when he heard a man's step there.  The\nmaid announced Mr Tooke, of Crofton; and Mr Tooke walked in.\n\nMrs Proctor had actually to push Hugh to one side,--so directly did he\nstand in the way between her and her visitor.  He stood, with his hands\nstill behind his back, gazing up at Mr Tooke, with his face hotter than\nthe multiplication-table had ever made it, and his eyes staring quite as\nearnestly as they had ever done to find Robinson Crusoe's island in the\nmap.\n\n\"Go, child,\" said Mrs Proctor: but this was not enough.  Mr Tooke\nhimself had to pass him under his left arm before he could shake hands\nwith Mrs Proctor.  Hugh was now covered with shame at this hint that he\nwas in the way; but yet he did not leave the room.  He stole to the\nwindow, and flung himself down on two chairs, as if looking into the\nstreet from behind the blind; but he saw nothing that passed out of\ndoors, so eager was his hope of hearing something of the Crofton boys,--\ntheir trap-ball, and their Saturday walk with the usher.  Not a word of\nthis kind did he hear.  As soon as Mr Tooke had agreed to stay to\ndinner, his sisters were desired to carry their work elsewhere,--to the\nleads, if they liked; and he was told that he might go to play.  He had\nhoped he might be overlooked in the window; and unwillingly did he put\ndown first one leg and then the other from the chairs, and saunter out\nof the room.  He did not choose to go near his sisters, to be told how\nstupidly he had stood in the gentleman's way; so, when he saw that they\nwere placing their stools on the leads, he went up into the attic, and\nthen down into the kitchen, to see where little Harry was, to play at\nschoolboys in the back yard.\n\nThe maid Susan was not sorry that Harry was taken off her hands; for she\nwished to rub up her spoons, and fill her castors afresh, for the sake\nof the visitor who had come in.  The thoughtful Jane soon came down with\nthe keys to get out a clean tablecloth, and order a dish of cutlets, in\naddition to the dinner, and consult with Susan about some dessert; so\nthat, as the little boys looked up from their play, they saw Agnes\nsitting alone at work upon the leads.\n\nThey had played some time, Hugh acting a naughty boy who could not say\nhis Latin lesson to the usher, and little Harry punishing him with far\nmore words than a real usher uses on such an occasion, when they heard\nAgnes calling them from above their heads.  She was leaning over from\nthe leads, begging Hugh to come up to her,--that very moment.  Harry\nmust be left below, as the leads were a forbidden place for him.  So\nHarry went to Jane, to see her dish up greengage plums which he must not\ntouch: and Hugh ran up the stairs.  As he passed through the passage,\nhis mother called him.  Full of some kind of hope (he did not himself\nknow what), he entered the parlour, and saw Mr Tooke's eyes fixed on\nhim.  But his mother only wanted him to shut the door as he passed; that\nwas all.  It had stood open, as it usually did on warm days.  Could his\nmother wish it shut on account of anything she was saying?  It was\npossible.\n\n\"O Hugh!\" exclaimed Agnes, as soon as he set foot on the leads.  \"What\ndo you think?--But is the parlour-door shut?  Who shut it?\"\n\n\"Mother bade me shut it, as I passed.\"\n\n\"O dear!\" said Agnes, in a tone of disappointment; \"then she did not\nmean us to hear what they were talking about.\"\n\n\"What was it?  Anything about the Crofton boys?  Anything about Phil?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you a word about it.  Mamma did not know I heard them.\nHow plain anyone can hear what they say in that parlour, Hugh, when the\ndoor is open!  What do you think I heard mamma tell Mrs Bicknor, last\nweek, when I was jumping Harry off the third stair?\"\n\n\"Never mind that.  Tell me what they are talking about now.  Do, Agnes.\"\n\nAgnes shook her head.\n\n\"Now do, dear.\"\n\nIt was hard for Agnes to refuse Hugh anything, at any time; more still\nwhen he called her \"dear,\" which he seldom did; and most of all when he\nput his arm round her neck, as he did now.  But she answered--\n\n\"I should like to tell you every word; but I cannot now.  Mamma has made\nyou shut the door.  She does not wish you to hear it.\"\n\n\"Me!  Then will you tell Jane?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I shall tell Jane, when we are with mamma at work.\"\n\n\"That is too bad!\" exclaimed Hugh, flinging himself down on the leads so\nvehemently that his sister was afraid he would roll over into the yard.\n\"What does Jane care about Crofton and the boys to what I do?\"\n\n\"There is one boy there that Jane cares about more than you do, or I, or\nanybody, except papa and mamma.  Jane loves Phil.\"\n\n\"O, then, what they are saying in the parlour is about Phil.\"\n\n\"I did not say that.\"\n\n\"You pretend you love me as Jane loves Phil!  And now you are going to\ntell her what you won't tell me!  Agnes, I will tell you everything I\nknow all my whole life, if you will just whisper this now.  Only just\nwhisper.--Or, I will tell you what.  I will guess and guess; and you can\nnod or shake your head.  That won't be telling.\"\n\n\"For shame, Hugh!  Phil would laugh at you for being a girl if you are\nso curious.  What mamma told Mrs Bicknor was that Jane was her\nright-hand.  What do you think that meant exactly?\"\n\n\"That Jane might give you a good slap when you are so provoking,\" said\nHugh, rolling over and over, till his clothes were covered with dust,\nand Agnes really thought once that he was fairly going over the edge\ninto the yard.\n\n\"There is something that I can tell you, Hugh; something that I want to\ntell you, and nobody else,\" said Agnes, glad to see him stop rolling\nabout, and raise himself on his dusty elbow to look at her.\n\n\"Well, come, what is it?\"\n\n\"You must promise beforehand not to be angry.\"\n\n\"Angry!  When am I angry, pray?  Come, tell me.\"\n\n\"You must--you really must--I have a particular reason for saying so--\nyou must learn how much four times seven is.  Now, remember, you\npromised not to be angry.\"\n\nHugh carried off his anger by balancing himself on his head, as if he\nmeant to send his heels over, but that there was no room.  From upside\ndowns his voice was heard saying that he knew that as well as Agnes.\n\n\"Well, then, how much is it?\"\n\n\"Twenty-eight, to be sure.  Who does not know that?\"\n\n\"Then pray do not call it fifty-six any more.  Miss Harold--\"\n\n\"There's the thing,\" said Hugh.  \"When Miss Harold is here, I can think\nof nothing but fifty-six.  It seems to sound in my ears, as if somebody\nspoke it, `four times seven is fifty-six.'\"\n\n\"You will make me get it by heart too, if you say it so often,\" said\nAgnes.  \"You had better say `twenty-eight' over to yourself all day\nlong.  You may say it to me as often as you like.  I shall not get\ntired.  Come, begin now--`four times seven'--\"\n\n\"I have had enough of that for to-day--tiresome stuff!  Now, I shall go\nand play with Harry again.\"\n\n\"But wait--just say that line once over, Hugh.  I have a reason for\nwishing it.  I have, indeed.\"\n\n\"Mother has been telling Mr Tooke that I cannot say my\nmultiplication-table!  Now, that is too bad!\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"And they\nwill make me say it after dinner!  What a shame!\"\n\n\"Why Hugh!  You know mamma does not like--you know mamma would not--you\nknow mamma never does anything unkind.  You should not say such things,\nHugh.\"\n\n\"Ay, there!  You cannot say that she has not told Mr Tooke that I say\nmy tables wrong.\"\n\n\"Well--you know you always do say it wrong to her.\"\n\n\"I will go somewhere.  I will hide myself.  I will run to the market\nwhile the cloth is laying.  I will get away, and not come back till Mr\nTooke is gone.  I will never say my multiplication table to him!\"\n\n\"Never?\" said Agnes, with an odd smile and a sigh.  \"However, do not\ntalk of running away, or hiding yourself.  You will not have to say\nanything to Mr Tooke to-day.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I feel sure you will not.  I do not believe Mr Tooke will talk to you,\nor to any of us.  There you go!  You will be in the water-butt in a\nminute, if you tumble so.\"\n\n\"I don't care if I am.  Mr Tooke will not come there to hear me say my\ntables.  Let me go!\" he cried, struggling, for now Agnes had caught him\nby the ankle.  \"If I do tumble in, the water is not up to my chin, and\nit will be a cool hiding-place this hot day.\"\n\n\"But there is Susan gone to lay the cloth; and you must be brushed; for\nyou are all over dust.  Come up, and I will brush you.\"\n\nHugh was determined to have a little more dust first.  He rolled once\nmore the whole length of the leads, turned over Jane's stool, and upset\nher work-basket, so that her thimble bounded off to a far corner, and\nthe shirt-collar she was stitching fell over into the water-butt.\n\n\"There!  What will Jane say?\" cried Agnes, picking up the basket, and\npeeping over into the small part of the top of the water-butt which was\nnot covered.\n\n\"There never was anything like boys for mischief,\" said the maid Susan,\nwho now appeared to pull Hugh in, and make him neat.  Susan always found\ntime, between laying the cloth and bringing up dinner, to smooth Hugh's\nhair, and give a particular lock a particular turn on his forehead with\na wet comb.\n\n\"Let that alone,\" said Hugh, as Agnes peeped into the butt after the\ndrowning collar.  \"I will have the top off this afternoon, and it will\nmake good fishing for Harry and me.\"\n\nAgnes had to let the matter alone; for Hugh was so dusty that she had to\nbrush one side of him while Susan did the other.  Susan gave him some\nhard knocks while she assured him that he was not going to have Harry up\non the leads to learn his tricks, or to be drowned.  She hardly knew\nwhich of the two would be the worst for Harry.  It was lucky for Hugh\nthat Susan was wanted below directly, for she scolded him the whole time\nshe was parting and smoothing his hair.  When it was done, however, and\nthe wet lock on his forehead took the right turn at once, she gave him a\nkiss in the very middle of it, and said she knew he would be a good boy\nbefore the gentleman from the country.\n\nHugh would not go in with Agnes, because he knew Mr Tooke would shake\nhands with her, and take notice of anyone who was with her.  He waited\nin the passage till Susan carried in the fish, when he entered behind\nher, and slipped to the window till the party took their seats, when he\nhoped Mr Tooke would not observe who sat between Agnes and his father.\nBut the very first thing his father did was to pull his head back by the\nhair behind, and ask him whether he had persuaded Mr Tooke to tell him\nall about the Crofton boys.\n\nHugh did not wish to make any answer; but his father said \"Eh?\" and he\nthought he must speak; so he said that Phil had told him all he wanted\nto know about the Crofton boys.\n\n\"Then you can get Mr Tooke to tell you about Phil, if you want nothing\nelse,\" said Mr Proctor.\n\nMr Tooke nodded and smiled; but Hugh began to hand plates with all his\nmight, he was so afraid that the next thing would be a question how much\nfour times seven was.\n\nThe dinner went on, however; and the fish was eaten, and the meat, and\nthe pudding; and the dessert was on the table, without any one having\neven alluded to the multiplication-table.  Before this time, Hugh had\nbecome quite at his ease, and had looked at Mr Tooke till he knew his\nface quite well.\n\nSoon after dinner Mr Proctor was called away upon business; and Hugh\nslipped into his father's arm-chair, and crossed one leg over the other\nknee, as he leaned back at his leisure, listening to Mr Tooke's\nconversation with his mother about the sort of education that he\nconsidered most fit for some boys from India, who had only a certain\ntime to devote to school-learning.  In the course of this conversation\nsome curious things dropped about the curiosity of children from India\nabout some things very common here;--their wonder at snow and ice, their\ndelight at being able to slide in the winter, and their curiosity about\nthe harvest and gleaning, now approaching.  Mr Proctor came back just\nas Mr Tooke was telling of the annual holiday of the boys at\nharvest-time, when they gleaned for the poor of the village.  As Hugh\nhad never seen a corn-field, he had no very clear idea of harvest and\ngleaning; and he wanted to hear all he could.  When obliged to turn out\nof the arm-chair, he drew a stool between his mother and Mr Tooke: and\npresently he was leaning on his arms on the table, with his face close\nto Mr Tooke's, as if swallowing the gentleman's words as they fell.\nThis was inconvenient; and his mother made him draw back his stool a\ngood way.  Though he could hear very well, Hugh did not like this, and\nhe slipped off his stool, and came closer and closer.\n\n\"And did you say,\" asked Mr Proctor, \"that your youngest pupil is\nnine?\"\n\n\"Just nine;--the age of my own boy.  I could have wished to have none\nunder ten, for the reason you know of.  But--\"\n\n\"I wish,\" cried Hugh, thrusting himself in so that Mr Tooke saw the boy\nhad a mind to sit on his knee,--\"I wish you would take boys at eight and\na quarter.\"\n\n\"That is your age,\" said Mr Tooke, smiling and making room between his\nknees.\n\n\"How did you know?  Mother told you.\"\n\n\"No; indeed she did not,--not exactly.  My boy was eight and a quarter\nnot very long ago; and he--\"\n\n\"Did he like being in your school?\"\n\n\"He always seemed very happy there, though he was so much the youngest.\nAnd they teased him sometimes for being the youngest.  Now you know, if\nyou came, you would be the youngest, and they might tease you for it.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should mind that.  What sort of teasing, though?\"\n\n\"Trying whether he was afraid of things.\"\n\n\"What sort of things?\"\n\n\"Being on the top of a wall, or up in a tree.  And then they sent him\nerrands when he was tired, or when he wanted to be doing something else.\nThey tried too whether he could bear some rough things without\ntelling.\"\n\n\"And did he?\"\n\n\"Yes, generally.  On the whole, very well.  I see they think him a brave\nboy now.\"\n\n\"I think I could.  But do not you really take boys as young as I am?\"\n\n\"Such is really my rule.\"\n\nIt was very provoking, but Hugh was here called away to fish up Jane's\nwork out of the water-butt.  As he had put it in, he was the proper\nperson to get it out.  He thought he should have liked the fun of it;\nbut now he was in a great hurry back, to hear Mr Tooke talk.  It really\nseemed as if the shirt-collar was alive, it always slipped away so when\nhe thought he had it.  Jane kept him to the job till he brought up her\nwork, dripping and soiled.  By that time tea was ready,--an early tea,\nbecause Mr Tooke had to go away.  Whatever was said at tea was about\npolitics, and about a new black dye which some chemist had discovered;\nand Mr Tooke went away directly after.\n\nHe turned round full upon Hugh, just as he was going.  Hugh stepped\nback, for it flashed upon him that he was now to be asked how much four\ntimes seven was.  But Mr Tooke only shook hands with him, and bade him\ngrow older as fast as he could.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. WHY MR TOOKE CAME.\n\nAfter tea the young people had to learn their lessons for the next day.\nThey always tried to get these done, and the books put away, before Mr\nProctor came in on his shop being shut, and the business of the day\nbeing finished.  He liked to find his children at liberty for a little\nplay, or half an hour of pleasant reading; or, in the winter evenings,\nfor a dance to the music of his violin.  Little Harry had been known to\nbe kept up far too late, that he might hear the violin, and that his\npapa might enjoy the fun of seeing him run about among the rest, putting\nthem all out, and fancying he was dancing.  All believed there would be\ntime for play with papa to-night, tea had been so much earlier than\nusual.  But Agnes soon feared there would be no play for Hugh.  Though\nJane pored over her German, twisting her forefinger in the particular\ncurl which she always twisted when she was deep in her lessons; though\nAgnes rocked herself on her chair, as she always did when she was\nlearning by heart; and though Mrs Proctor kept Harry quiet at the other\nend of the room with telling him long stories, in a very low voice,\nabout the elephant and Brighton pier, in the picture-book, Hugh could\nnot learn his capital cities.  He even spoke out twice, and stopped\nhimself when he saw all the heads in the room raised in surprise.  Then\nhe set himself to work again, and he said \"Copenhagen\" so often over\nthat he was not likely to forget the word; but what country it belonged\nto he could not fix in his mind, though Agnes wrote it down large on the\nslate, in hopes that the sight of the letters would help him to\nremember.  Before he had got on to \"Constantinople,\" the well-known\nsound was heard of the shop-boy taking the shop-shutters out of their\nday-place, and Mr Proctor would certainly be coming presently.  Jane\nclosed her dictionary, and shook back her curls from over her eyes; Mrs\nProctor put down Harry from her lap, and let him call for papa as loud\nas he would; and papa came bustling in, and gave Harry a long toss, and\nseveral topplings over his shoulder, and yet Hugh was not ready.\n\n\"Come, children,\" said Mr Proctor to Agnes and Hugh, \"we have all done\nenough for to-day.  Away with books and slates!\"\n\n\"But, papa,\" said Agnes, \"Hugh has not quite done.  If he might have\njust five minutes more, Miss Harold--\"\n\n\"Never mind what Miss Harold says!  That is, you girls must; but between\nthis and Michaelmas--\"\n\nHe stopped short, and the girls saw that it was a sign from their mother\nthat made him do so.  He immediately proceeded to make so much noise\nwith Harry, that Hugh discovered nothing more than that he might put\naway his books, and not mind Miss Harold this time.  If she asked him\nto-morrow why he had not got down to \"Constantinople,\" he could tell her\nexactly what his father had said.  So merry was Hugh's play this\nevening.  He stood so perfectly upright on his father's shoulders, that\nhe could reach the top of his grandmamma's picture, and show by his\nfinger-ends how thick the dust lay upon the frame: and neither he nor\nhis father minded being told that he was far too old for such play.\n\nIn the midst of the fun, Hugh had a misgiving, more than once, of his\nmother having something severe to say to him when she should come up to\nhis room, to hear him say his prayer, and to look back a little with him\nupon the events of the day.  Besides his consciousness that he had done\nnothing well this day, there were grave looks from his mother which made\nhim think that she was not pleased with him.  When he was undressing,\ntherefore, he listened with some anxiety for her footsteps, and, when\nshe appeared, he was ready with his confession of idleness.  She stopped\nhim in the beginning, saying that she had rather not hear any more such\nconfessions.  She had listened to too many, and had allowed him to spend\nin confessions some of the strength which should have been applied to\nmending his faults.  For the present, while she was preparing a way to\nhelp him to conquer his inattention, she advised him to say nothing to\nher, or to any one else, on the subject; but this need not prevent him\nfrom praying to God to give him strength to overcome his great fault.\n\n\"Oh, mother!  Mother!\" cried Hugh, in an agony, \"you give me up!  What\nshall I do if you will not help me any more?\"\n\nHis mother smiled, and told him he need not fear any such thing.  It\nwould be very cruel to leave off providing him with food and clothes,\nbecause it gave trouble to do so; and it would be far more cruel to\nabandon him to his faults, for such a reason.  She would never cease to\nhelp him till they were cured: but, as all means yet tried had failed,\nshe must plan some others; and meantime she did not wish him to become\nhardened to his faults, by talking about them every night, when there\nwas no amendment during the day.\n\nThough she spoke very kindly, and kissed him before she went away, Hugh\nfelt that he was punished.  He felt more unhappy than if his mother had\ntold him all she thought of his idleness.  Though his mother had told\nhim to go to sleep, and blessed him, he could not help crying a little,\nand wishing that he was a Crofton boy.  He supposed the Crofton boys all\ngot their lessons done somehow, as a matter of course; and then they\ncould go to sleep without any uncomfortable feelings or any tears.\n\nIn the morning all these thoughts were gone.  He had something else to\nthink about; for he had to play with Harry, and take care of him, while\nSusan swept and dusted the parlour: and Harry was bent upon going into\nthe shop--a place where, according to the rule of the house, no child of\nthe family was ever to set foot till it was old enough to be trusted;\nnor to taste anything there, asked or unasked.  There were some\npoisonous things in the shop, and some few nice syrups and gums; and no\nchild could be safe and well there who could not let alone whatever\nmight be left on the counter, or refuse any nice taste that a\ngood-natured shopman might offer.  Harry was, as yet, far too young;\nbut, as often as the cook washed the floor-cloth in the passage, so that\nthe inner shop-door had to be opened, Master Harry was seized with an\nunconquerable desire to go and see the blue and red glass bowls which he\nwas permitted to admire from the street, as he went out and came in from\nhis walks.  Mr Proctor came down this morning as Hugh was catching\nHarry in the passage.  He snatched up his boys, packed one under each\narm, and ran with them into the yard, where he rolled Harry up in a new\nmat, which the cook was going to lay at the house-door.\n\n\"There!\" said he.  \"Keep him fast, Hugh, till the passage-door is shut.\nWhat shall we do with the rogue when you are at Crofton, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Why, papa!  He will be big enough to take care of himself by that\ntime.\"\n\n\"Bless me!  I forgot again,\" exclaimed Mr Proctor, as he made haste\naway into the shop.\n\nBefore long, Harry was safe under the attraction of his basin of bread\nand milk; and Hugh fell into a reverie at the breakfast-table, keeping\nhis spoon suspended in his hand as he looked up at the windows, without\nseeing anything.  Jane asked him twice to hand the butter before he\nheard.\n\n\"He is thinking how much four times seven is,\" observed Mr Proctor: and\nHugh started at the words.\n\n\"I tell you what, Hugh,\" continued his father; \"if the Crofton people do\nnot teach you how much four times seven is when you come within four\nweeks of next Christmas-day, I shall give you up, and them too, for\ndunces all.\"\n\nAll the eyes round the table were fixed on Mr Proctor in an instant.\n\n\"There now!\" said he, \"I have let the cat out of the bag.  Look at\nAgnes!\" and he pinched her crimson cheek.\n\nEverybody then looked at Agnes, except Harry, who was busy looking for\nthe cat which papa said had come out of mamma's work-bag.  Agnes could\nnot bear the gaze, and burst into tears.\n\n\"Agnes has taken more pains to keep the secret than her papa,\" said Mrs\nProctor.  \"The secret is, that Hugh is going to Crofton next month.\"\n\n\"Am I ten, then?\" asked Hugh, in his hurry and surprise.\n\n\"Scarcely; since you were only eight and a quarter yesterday afternoon,\"\nreplied his father.\n\n\"I will tell you all about it by-and-by, my dear,\" said his mother.  Her\nglance towards Agnes made all the rest understand that they had better\nspeak of something else now.  So Mr Proctor beckoned Harry to come and\nsee whether the cat had not got into the bag again, as she was not to be\nseen anywhere else.  It is true, the bag was not much bigger than a\ncat's head; but that did not matter to Harry, who never cared for that\nsort of consideration, and had been busy for half an hour, the day\nbefore, in trying to put the key of the house-door into the key-hole of\nthe tea-caddy.\n\nBy the time Agnes had recovered herself, and the table was cleared, Miss\nHarold had arrived.  Hugh brought his books with the rest, but, instead\nof opening them, rested his elbow on the uppermost, and stared full at\nMiss Harold.\n\n\"Well, Hugh!\" said she, smiling.\n\n\"I have not learned quite down to `Constantinople,'\" said he.  \"Papa\ntold me I need not, and not to mind you.\"\n\n\"Why, Hugh!  Hush!\" cried Jane.\n\n\"He did,--he said exactly that.  But he meant, Miss Harold, that I am to\nbe a Crofton boy,--directly, next month.\"\n\n\"Then have we done with one another, Hugh?\" asked Miss Harold, gently.\n\"Will you not learn any more from me?\"\n\n\"That is for your choice, Miss Harold,\" observed Mrs Proctor.  \"Hugh\nhas not deserved the pains you have taken with him: and if you decline\nmore trouble with him now he is going into other hands, no one can\nwonder.\"\n\nMiss Harold feared that he was but poorly prepared for school, and was\nquite ready to help him, if he would give his mind to the effort.  She\nthought that play, or reading books that he liked, was less waste of\ntime than his common way of doing his lessons; but if he was disposed\nreally to work, with the expectation of Crofton before him, she was\nready to do her best to prepare him for the real hard work he would have\nto do there.  His mother proposed that he should have time to consider\nwhether he would have a month's holiday or a month's work, before\nleaving home.  She had to go out this morning.  He might go with her, if\nhe liked; and as they returned, they would sit down in the Temple\nGarden, and she would tell him all about the plan.\n\nHugh liked this beginning of his new prospects.  He ran to be made neat\nfor his walk with his mother.  He knew he must have the wet curl on his\nforehead twice over to day, but he comforted himself with hoping that\nthere would be no time at Crofton for him to be kept standing, to have\nhis hair done so particularly, and to be scolded all the while, and then\nkissed, like a baby, at the end.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. MICHAELMAS-DAY COME.\n\nHugh was about to ask his mother, again and again during their walk, why\nMr Tooke let him go to Crofton before he was ten; but Mrs Proctor was\ngrave and silent; and though she spoke kindly to him now and then, she\ndid not seem disposed to talk.  At last they were in the Temple Garden;\nand they sat down where there was no one to overhear them; and then Hugh\nlooked up at his mother.  She saw, and told him, what it was that he\nwanted to ask.\n\n\"It is on account of the little boys themselves,\" said she, \"that Mr\nTooke does not wish to have them very young, now that there is no kind\nlady in the house who could be like a mother to them.\"\n\n\"But there is Mrs Watson.  Phil has told me a hundred things about Mrs\nWatson.\"\n\n\"Mrs Watson is the housekeeper.  She is careful, I know, about the\nboys' health and comfort; but she has no time to attend to the younger\nones, as Mrs Tooke did,--hearing their little troubles, and being a\nfriend to them like their mothers at home.\"\n\n\"There is Phil--\"\n\n\"Yes.  You will have Phil to look to.  But neither Phil, nor any one\nelse, can save you from some troubles you are likely to have from being\nthe youngest.\"\n\n\"Such as Mr Tooke told me his boy had;--being put on the top of a high\nwall, and plagued when he was tired: and all that.  I don't think I\nshould much mind those things.\"\n\n\"So we hope, and so we believe.  Your fault is not cowardice--\"\n\nMrs Proctor so seldom praised anybody that her words of esteem went a\ngreat way.  Hugh first looked up at her, and then down on the grass,--\nhis cheeks glowed so.  She went on--\n\n\"You have faults,--faults which give your father and me great pain; and\nthough you are not cowardly about being hurt in your body, you sadly\nwant courage of a better kind,--courage to mend the weakness of your\nmind.  You are so young that we are sorry for you, and mean to send you\nwhere the example of other boys may give you the resolution you want so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"All the boys learn their lessons at Crofton,\" observed Hugh.\n\n\"Yes; but not by magic.  They have to give their minds to their work.\nYou will find it painful and difficult to learn this, after your idle\nhabits at home.  I give you warning that you will find it much more\ndifficult than you suppose; and I should not wonder if you wish yourself\nat home with Miss Harold many times before Christmas.\"\n\nMrs Proctor was not unkind in saying this.  She saw that Hugh was so\ndelighted about going that nothing would depress his spirits, and that\nthe chief fear was his being disappointed and unhappy when she should be\nfar away.  It might then be some consolation to him to remember that she\nwas aware of what he would have to go through.  He now smiled, and said\nhe did not think he should ever wish to say his lessons to Miss Harold\nas long as he lived.  Then it quickly passed through his mind that,\ninstead of the leads and the little yard, there would be the playground;\nand instead of the church bells, the rooks; and instead of Susan, with\nher washing and combing, and scolding and kissing, there would be plenty\nof boys to play with.  As he thought of these things, he started up, and\ntoppled head over heels on the grass, and then was up by his mother's\nside again, saying that he did not care about anything that was to\nhappen at Crofton;--he was not afraid,--not even of the usher, though\nPhil could not bear him.\n\n\"If you can bring yourself to learn your lessons well,\" said his mother,\n\"you need not fear the usher.  But remember it depends upon that.  You\nwill do well enough in the playground, I have no doubt.\"\n\nAfter this, there was only to settle the time that was to pass--the\nweeks, days, and hours before Michaelmas-day; and whether these weeks\nand days should be employed in preparing for Crofton under Miss Harold,\nor whether he should take his chance there unprepared as he was.  Mrs\nProctor saw that his habits of inattention were so fixed, and his\ndisgust at lessons in the parlour so strong, that she encouraged his\ndoing no lessons in the interval.  Hugh would have said beforehand that\nthree weeks' liberty to read voyages and travels, and play with Harry,\nwould have made him perfectly happy; but he felt that there was some\ndisgrace mixed up with his holiday, and that everybody would look upon\nhim with a sort of pity, instead of wishing him joy; and this spoiled\nhis pleasure a good deal.  When he came home from his walk, Agnes\nthought he looked less happy than when he went out; and she feared his\nspirits were down about Crofton.\n\nHis spirits were up and down many times during the next three weeks.  He\nthought these weeks would never be over.  Every day dragged on more\nslowly than the last; at every meal he was less inclined to eat; and his\nhappiest time was when going to bed, because he was a day nearer\nCrofton.  His mother, foreseeing just what happened, wished to have kept\nthe news from him till within a week of his departure, and had agreed\nwith Mr Proctor that it should be so.  But Mr Proctor hated secrets,\nand, as we see, let it out immediately.\n\nAt last, the day came;--a warm, sunny, autumn day, on which any one\nmight have enjoyed the prospect of a drive into the country.  The coach\nwas to set off from an inn in Fleet Street, at noon, and would set Hugh\ndown at his uncle's door in time for dinner, the distance being\ntwenty-eight miles.  His uncle's house was just two miles from the\nschool.  Phil would probably be there to meet his brother, and take him\nto Crofton in the afternoon.\n\nHow to get rid of the hours till noon was the question.  Hugh had had\neverything packed up, over which he had any control, for some days.  He\nhad not left himself a plaything of those which he might carry: and it\nfrightened him that his mother did not seem to think of packing his\nclothes till after breakfast this very morning.  When she entered his\nroom for the purpose, he was fidgeting about, saying to himself that he\nshould never be ready.  Agnes came with her mother, to help: but before\nthe second shirt was laid in the box, she was in tears and had to go\naway; for every one in the house was in the habit of hiding tears from\nMrs Proctor, who rarely shed them herself, and was known to think that\nthey might generally be suppressed, and should be so.\n\nAs Hugh stood beside her, handing stockings and handkerchiefs, to fill\nup the corners of the box, she spoke as she might not have done if they\nhad not been alone.  She said but a few words; but Hugh never forgot\nthem.\n\n\"You know, my dear,\" said she, \"that I do not approve of dwelling upon\ntroubles.  You know I never encourage my children to fret about what\ncannot be helped.\"\n\nThere was nothing in the world that Hugh was more certain of than this.\n\n\"And yet I tell you,\" she continued, \"that you will not be nearly so\nhappy at Crofton as you expect--at least, at first.  It grieves me to\nsee you so full of expectation--\"\n\n\"Does it indeed, mother?\"\n\n\"It does indeed.  But my comfort is--\"\n\n\"You think I can bear it,\" cried Hugh, holding up his head.  \"You think\nI can bear anything.\"\n\n\"I think you are a brave boy, on the whole.  But that is not the comfort\nI was speaking of; for there is a world of troubles too heavy for the\nbravery of a thoughtless child, like you.  My comfort is, my dear, that\nyou know where to go for strength when your heart fails you.  You will\nbe away from your father and me; but a far wiser and kinder parent will\nbe always with you.  If I were not sure that you would continually open\nyour heart to Him, I could not let you go from me.\"\n\n\"I will--I always do,\" said Hugh, in a low voice.  \"Then remember this,\nmy boy.  If you have that help, _you must not fail_.  Knowing that you\nhave that help, I expect of you that you do your own duty, and bear your\nown troubles, like a man.  If you were to be all alone in the new world\nyou are going to, you would be but a helpless child: but remember, when\na child makes God his friend, God puts into the youngest and weakest the\nspirit of a man.\"\n\n\"You will ask Him too, mother;--you will pray Him to make me brave,\nand--and--\"\n\n\"And what else?\" she inquired, fixing her eyes upon him.\n\n\"And steady,\" replied Hugh, casting down his eyes; \"for that is what I\nwant most of all.\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied his mother.  \"I do, and always will, pray for you.\"\n\nNot another word was said till they went down into the parlour.  Though\nit was only eleven o'clock, Miss Harold was putting on her bonnet to go\naway: and there was a plate of bread and cheese on the table.\n\n\"Lunch!\" said Hugh, turning away with disgust.  \"Do eat it,\" said Agnes,\nwho had brought it.  \"You had no breakfast, you know.\"\n\n\"Because I did not want it; and I can't eat anything now.\"\n\nJane made a sign to Agnes to take the plate out of sight: and she put\nsome biscuits into a paper bag, that he might eat on the road, if he\nshould become hungry.\n\nNeither Miss Harold nor Hugh could possibly feel any grief at parting;\nfor they had had little satisfaction together; but she said very kindly\nthat she should hope to hear often of him, and wished he might be happy\nas a Crofton boy.  Hugh could hardly answer her;--so amazed was he to\nfind that his sisters were giving up an hour of their lessons on his\naccount,--that they might go with him to the coach!--And then Susan came\nin, about the cord for his box, and her eyes were red:--and, at the\nsight of her, Agnes began to cry again; and Jane bent down her head over\nthe glove she was mending for him, and her needle stopped.\n\n\"Jane,\" said her mother, gravely, \"if you are not mending that glove,\ngive it to me.  It is getting late.\"\n\nJane brushed her hand across her eyes, and stitched away again.  Then\nshe threw the gloves to Hugh without looking at him, and ran to get\nready to go to the coach.\n\nThe bustle of the inn-yard would not do for little Harry.  He could not\ngo.  Hugh was extremely surprised to find that all the rest were\ngoing;--that even his father was smoothing his hat in the passage for\nthe walk,--really leaving the shop at noon on his account!  The porter\nwas at his service too,--waiting for his box!  It was very odd to feel\nof such consequence.\n\nHugh ran down to bid the maids good-bye.  The cook had cut a sandwich,\nwhich she thrust into his pocket, though he told her he had some\nbiscuits.  Susan cried so that little Harry stood grave and wondering.\nSusan sobbed out that she knew he did not care a bit about leaving home\nand everybody.  Hugh wished she would not say so, though he felt it was\ntrue, and wondered at it himself.  Mr Proctor heard Susan's\nlamentations, and called to her from the passage above not to make\nherself unhappy about that; for the time would soon come when Hugh would\nbe homesick enough.\n\nMr Blake, the shopman, came to the shop-door as they passed, and bowed\nand smiled; and the boy put himself in the way, with a broad grin: and\nthen the party walked on quickly.\n\nThe sun seemed to Hugh to glare very much; and he thought he had never\nknown the streets so noisy, or the people so pushing.  The truth was,\nhis heart was beating so he could scarcely see: and yet he was so busy\nlooking about him for a sight of the river, and everything he wished to\nbid good-bye to, that his father, who held him fast by the hand, shook\nhim more than once, and told him he would run everybody down if he\ncould,--to judge by his way of walking.  He must learn to march better,\nif he was to be a soldier; and to steer, if he was to be a sailor.\n\nThere were just two minutes to spare when they reached the inn-yard.\nThe horses were pawing and fidgeting, and some of the passengers had\nmounted: so Mr Proctor said he would seat the boy at once.  He spoke to\ntwo men who were on the roof, just behind the coachman; and they agreed\nto let Hugh sit between them, on the assurance that the driver would\nlook to his concerns, and see that he was set down at the right place.\n\n\"Now, my boy, up with you!\" said his father, as he turned from speaking\nto these men.  Hugh was so eager, that he put up his foot to mount,\nwithout remembering to bid his mother and sisters good-bye.  Mr Proctor\nlaughed at this; and nobody wondered; but Agnes cried bitterly; and she\ncould not forget it, from that time till she saw her brother again.\nWhen they had all kissed him, and his mother's earnest look had bidden\nhim remember what had passed between them that morning, he was lifted up\nby his father, and received by the two men, between whom he found a safe\nseat.\n\nThen he wished they were off.  It was uncomfortable to see his sisters\ncrying there, and not to be able to cry too, or to speak to them.  When\nthe coachman was drawing on his second glove, and the ostlers held each\na hand to pull off the horse-cloths, and the last moment was come, Mr\nProctor swung himself up by the step, to say one thing more.  It was--\n\n\"I say, Hugh,--can you tell me,--how much is four times seven?\"\n\nMrs Proctor pulled her husband's coat-tail, and he leaped down, the\nhorses' feet scrambled, their heads issued from the gateway of the\ninn-yard, and Hugh's family were left behind.  In the midst of the\nnoise, the man on Hugh's right-hand said to the one on his left,--\n\n\"There is some joke in that last remark, I imagine.\"\n\nThe other man nodded; and then there was no more speaking till they were\noff the stones.  When the clatter was over, and the coach began to roll\nalong the smooth road, Hugh's neighbour repeated,--\n\n\"There was some joke, I fancy, in that last remark of your father's.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Are you in the habit of saying the multiplication-table when you\ntravel?\" said the other.  \"If so, we shall be happy to hear it.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly happy,\" observed the first.\n\n\"I never say it when I can help it,\" said Hugh; \"and I see no occasion\nnow.\"\n\nThe men laughed, and then asked him if he was going far.\n\n\"To Crofton.  I am going to be a Crofton boy,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"A what?  Where is he going?\" his companions asked one another over his\nhead.  They were no wiser when Hugh repeated what he had said; nor could\nthe coachman enlighten them.  He only knew that he was to put the boy\ndown at Shaw's, the great miller's, near thirty miles along the road.\n\n\"Eight-and-twenty,\" said Hugh, in correction; \"and Crofton is two miles\nfrom my uncle's.\"\n\n\"Eight-and-twenty.  The father's joke lies there,\" observed the\nright-hand man.\n\n\"No, it does not,\" said Hugh.  He thought he was among a set of very odd\npeople,--none of them knowing what a Crofton boy was.  A passenger who\nsat beside the coachman only smiled when he was appealed to; so it might\nbe concluded that he was ignorant too; and the right and left-hand men\nseemed so anxious for information, that Hugh told them all he knew;--\nabout the orchard and the avenue, and the pond on the heath, and the\nplayground; and Mrs Watson, and the usher, and Phil, and Joe Cape, and\nTony Nelson, and several others of the boys.\n\nOne of the men asked him if he was sure he was going for the first\ntime,--he seemed so thoroughly informed of everything about Crofton.\nHugh replied that it was a good thing to have an elder brother like\nPhil.  Phil had told him just what to take to Crofton, and how to take\ncare of his money, and everything.\n\n\"Ay!  And how do the Crofton boys take care of their money?\"\n\nHugh showed a curious little inner pocket in his jacket, which nobody\nwould dream of that did not know.  His mother had let him have such a\npocket in both his jackets; and he had wanted to have all his money in\nthis one now, to show how safely he could carry it.  But his mother had\nchosen to pack up all his five shillings in his box,--that square box,\nwith the new brass lock, on the top of all the luggage.  In his pocket\nthere was only sixpence now,--the sixpence he was to give the coachman\nwhen he was set down.\n\nThen he went on to explain that this sixpence was not out of his own\nmoney, but given him by his father, expressly for the coachman.  Then\nhis right-hand companion congratulated him upon his spirits, and began\nto punch and tickle him; and when Hugh writhed himself about, because he\ncould not bear tickling, the coachman said he would have no such doings,\nand bade them be quiet.  Then the passengers seemed to forget Hugh, and\ntalked to one another of the harvest in the north, and the hopping in\nKent.  Hugh listened about the hopping, supposing it might be some new\ngame, as good as leap-frog; though it seemed strange that one farmer\nshould begin hopping on Monday, and that another should fix Thursday;\nand that both should be so extremely anxious about the weather.  But\nwhen he found it was some sort of harvest-work, he left off listening,\nand gave all his attention to the country sights that were about him.\nHe did not grow tired of the gardens, gay with dahlias and hollyhocks,\nand asters: nor of the orchards, where the ladder against the tree, and\nthe basket under, showed that apple-gathering was going on; nor of the\nnooks in the fields, where blackberries were ripening; nor of the\nchequered sunlight and shadow which lay upon the road; nor of the breezy\nheath where the blue ponds were ruffled; nor of the pleasant grove where\nthe leaves were beginning to show a tinge of yellow and red, here and\nthere among the green.  Silently he enjoyed all these things, only\nawakening from them when there was a stop to change horses.\n\nHe was not thinking of time or distance when he saw the coachman glance\nround at him, and felt that the speed of the horses was slackening.\nStill he had no idea that this was any concern of his, till he saw\nsomething that made him start.\n\n\"Why, there's Phil!\" he exclaimed, jumping to his feet.\n\n\"This is Shaw's mill, and there is Shaw; which is all I have to do\nwith,\" said the coachman, as he pulled up.\n\nHugh was soon down, with his uncle and Phil, and one of the men from the\nmill to help.  His aunt was at the window too; so that altogether Hugh\nforgot to thank his companions for his safe seat.  He would have\nforgotten his box, but for the coachman.  One thing more he also forgot.\n\n\"I say, young master,\" said the driver, \"remember the coachman.  Where's\nyour sixpence?\"\n\n\"Oh, my sixpence!\" cried Hugh, throwing down what he held, to feel in\nhis curious inner pocket, which was empty.\n\n\"Lest you find a hole in your pocket, here is a sixpence for you,\" cried\nthe right-hand passenger, tossing him his own sixpence.  \"Thank you for\nteaching us the secret of such a curious pocket.\"\n\nThe coachman was impatient, got his money, and drove off, leaving Hugh\nto make out why he had been tickled, and how his money had changed\nhands.  With a very red face, he declared it was too bad of the man: but\nthe man was out of his hearing, and could never know how angry he was.\n\n\"A pretty story this is for our usher to have against you, to begin\nwith,\" was Phil's consolation.  \"Every boy will know it before you show\nyourself; and you will never hear the last of it, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Your usher!\" exclaimed Hugh, bewildered.\n\n\"Yes, our usher.  That was he on the box, beside coachee.  Did not you\nfind out that much in all these eight-and-twenty miles?\"\n\n\"How should I?  He never told me.\"\n\nHugh could hardly speak to his uncle and aunt, he was so taken up with\ntrying to remember what he had said, in the usher's hearing, of the\nusher himself, and everybody at Crofton.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. MICHAELMAS-DAY OVER.\n\nMrs Shaw ordered dinner presently; and while it was being served, she\ndesired Phil to brush his brother's clothes, as they were dusty from his\nride.  All the while he was brushing (which, he did very roughly), and\nall the first part of dinner-time, Phil continued to tease Hugh about\nwhat he had said on the top of the coach.  Mrs Shaw spoke of the\nimprudence of talking freely before strangers; and Hugh could have told\nher that he did not need such a lecture at the very time that he found\nthe same thing by his experience.  He did wish Phil would stop.  If\nanybody should ask him a question, he could not answer without crying.\nThen he remembered how his mother expected him to bear things; and he\nalmost wished he was at home with her now, after all his longing to be\naway.  This thought nearly made him cry again; so he tried to dwell on\nhow his mother would expect him to bear things: but neither of them had\nthought that morning, beside his box, that the first trial would come\nfrom Phil.  This again made him so nearly cry that his uncle observed\nhis twitching face, and, without noticing him, said that he, for his\npart, did not want to see little boys wise before they had time to\nlearn; and that the most silent companion he had ever been shut up with\nin a coach was certainly the least agreeable: and he went on to relate\nan adventure which has happened to more persons than one.  He had found\nthe gentleman in the corner, with the shaggy coat, to be a bear--a tame\nbear, which had to take the quickest mode of conveyance, in order to be\nat a distant fair in good time.  Mr Shaw spun out his story, so that\nHugh quite recovered himself, and laughed as much as anybody at his\nuncle having formed a bad opinion of Bruin in the early twilight, for\nhis incivility in not bowing to the passenger who left the coach.\n\nAfter dinner, Phil thought it time to be off to Crofton.  He had missed\nsomething by coming away at all to-day; and he was not going to run the\nchance of losing the top of the class by not having time to do his\nSallust properly.  Mrs Shaw said they must have some of her plums\nbefore they went, and a glass of wine; and Mr Shaw ordered the gig,\nsaying he would drive them, and thus no time would be lost, though he\nhoped Phil would not mind being at the bottom of every class for once to\nhelp his brother, seeing how soon a diligent boy might work his way up\nagain.  Phil replied that that was not so easy as people might think,\nwhen there was one like Joe Cape determined to keep him down, if he\ncould once get him down.\n\n\"I hope you will find time to help Hugh up from the bottom, in a class\nor two,\" said Mr Shaw.  \"You will not be too busy about your own\naffairs to look to his, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Where is the use of my meddling?\" said Phil.  \"He can't rise for years\nto come.  Besides--\"\n\n\"Why can't I rise?\" exclaimed Hugh, with glowing cheeks.\n\n\"That is right, Hugh,\" said his uncle.  \"Let nobody prophesy for you\ntill you show what you can do.\"\n\n\"Why, uncle, he is nearly two years younger than any boy in the school;\nand--\"\n\n\"And there is little Page above you in algebra.  He is about two years\nyounger than you, Phil, if I remember right.\"\n\nHugh could not help clapping his hands at the prospect this held out to\nhim.  Phil took the act for triumphing over him, and went on to say,\nvery insultingly, that a little fellow who had been brought up among the\ngirls all his life, and had learned of nobody but Miss Harold, could not\nbe expected to cut any figure among boys.  Hugh looked so grieved for a\nmoment, and then suddenly so relieved, that his kind uncle wondered what\nwas in his mind.  He took the boy between his knees and asked him.\n\nHugh loved his uncle already, as if he had always known him.  He put his\narms round his neck, and whispered in his ear what he was thinking of;--\nhis mother's saying that God could and would, if He was sought, put the\nspirit of a man into the feeblest child.\n\n\"True!--quite true!  I am very glad you know that, my boy.  That will\nhelp you to learn at Crofton, though it is better than anything they can\nteach you in their school-room.\"\n\nMrs Shaw and Phil looked curious; but Mr Shaw did not repeat a word of\nwhat Hugh had said.  He put the boy away from his knees, because he\nheard the gig coming round.\n\nMrs Shaw told Hugh that she hoped he would spend some of his Sundays\nwith his uncle and her; and his uncle added that he must come on\nholidays as well as Sundays,--there was so much to see about the mill.\n\nPhil was amused, and somewhat pleased, to find how exactly Hugh\nremembered his description of the place and neighbourhood.  He\nrecognised the duck-pond under the hedge by the road-side, with the very\nfinest blackberries growing above it, just out of reach.  The church he\nknew, of course, and the row of chestnuts, whose leaves were just\nbeginning to fall; and the high wall dividing the orchard from the\nplayground.  That must have been the wall on which Mr Tooke's little\nboy used to be placed to frighten him.  It did not look so very high as\nHugh had fancied it.  One thing which he had never seen or heard of was\nthe bell, under its little roof on the ridge of Mr Tooke's great house.\nWas it to call in the boys to school, or for an alarm?  His uncle told\nhim it might serve the one purpose in the day, and the other by night;\nand that almost every large farm thereabouts had such a bell on the top\nof the house.\n\nThe sun was near its setting when they came in sight of the Crofton\nhouse.  A long range of windows glittered in the yellow light, and Phil\nsaid that the lower row all belonged to the school-room;--that whole\nrow.\n\nIn the midst of his explanations Phil stopped, and his manner grew more\nrough than ever--with a sort of shyness in it too.  It was because some\nof the boys were within hearing, leaning over the pales which separated\nthe playground from the road.\n\n\"I say; hollo there!\" cried one.  \"Is that Prater you have got with\nyou?\"\n\n\"Prater the second,\" cried another.  \"He could not have had his name if\nthere had not been Prater the first.\"\n\n\"There!  There's a scrape you have got me into already!\" muttered Phil.\n\n\"Be a man, Phil, and bear your own share,\" said Mr Shaw; \"and no spite,\nbecause your words come back to you!\"\n\nThe talk at the palings still went on, as the gig rolled quietly in the\nsandy by-road.\n\n\"Prater!\" poor Hugh exclaimed.  \"What a name!\"\n\n\"Yes; that is you,\" said his uncle.  \"You know now what your nick-name\nwill be.  Every boy has one or another: and yours might have been worse,\nbecause you might have done many a worse thing to earn it.\"\n\n\"But the usher, uncle?\"\n\n\"What of him?\"\n\n\"He should not have told about me.\"\n\n\"Don't call him `Prater the third,' however.  Bear your own share, as I\nsaid to Phil, and don't meddle with another's.\"\n\nPerhaps Mr Shaw hoped that through one of the boys the usher would get\na new nick-name for his ill-nature in telling tales of a little boy,\nbefore he was so much as seen by his companions.  He certainly put it\ninto their heads, whether they would make use of it or not.\n\nMr Tooke was out, taking his evening ride; but Mr Shaw would not drive\noff till he had seen Mrs Watson, and introduced his younger nephew to\nher, observing to her that he was but a little fellow to come among such\na number of rough boys.  Mrs Watson smiled kindly at Hugh, and said she\nwas glad he had a brother in the school, to prevent his feeling lonely\nat first.  It would not take many days, she hoped, to make him feel\nquite at home.  Mr Shaw slipped half-a-crown into Hugh's hand, and\nwhispered to him to try to keep it safe in his inner pocket Hugh ran\nafter him to the door, to tell him he had five shillings already--safe\nin his box: but his uncle would not take back the half-crown.  He\nthought that, in course of time, Hugh would want all the money he had.\n\nMrs Watson desired Phil to show his brother where he was to sleep, and\nto help him to put by his clothes.  Phil was in a hurry to get to his\nSallust; so that he was not sorry when Mrs Watson herself came up to\nsee that the boy's clothes were laid properly in the deep drawer in\nwhich Hugh was to keep his things.  Phil then slipped away.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mrs Watson, turning over one of Hugh's new collars, \"we\nmust have something different from this.  These collars tied with a\nblack ribbon are never tidy.  They are always over one shoulder or the\nother.\"\n\n\"My sisters made them; and they worked so hard to get them done!\" said\nHugh.\n\n\"Very well--very right: only it is a pity they are not of a better make.\nEvery Sunday at church, I shall see your collar awry--and every time\nyou go to your aunt's, she will think we do not make you neat.  I must\nsee about that.  Here are good stockings, however--properly stout.  My\ndear, are these all the shoes you have got?\"\n\n\"I have a pair on.\"\n\n\"Of course; I don't doubt that.  We must have you measured to-morrow for\nsome boots fitter for the country than these.  We have no London\npavement here.\"\n\nAnd so Mrs Watson went on, sometimes approving and sometimes\ncriticising, till Hugh did not know whether to cry or to be angry.\nAfter all the pains his mother and sisters had taken about his things,\nthey were to be found fault with in this way!\n\nWhen his box was emptied, and his drawer filled, Mrs Watson took him\ninto the school-room, where the boys were at supper.  Outside the door\nthe buzz seemed prodigious, and Hugh hoped that, in such a bustle,\nnobody would notice him.  Here he was quite mistaken.  The moment he\nentered there was a hush, and all eyes were turned upon him, except his\nbrother's.  Phil hardly looked up from his book; but he made room for\nHugh between himself and another boy, and drew the great plate of bread\nwithin reach.  Mrs Watson saw that Hugh had his basin of milk; and he\nfound it a good thing to have something to do while so many eyes were\nupon him.  He felt that he might have cried if he had not had his supper\nto eat.\n\nThe usher sat at the top of the table, reading.  Mrs Watson called his\nattention to Hugh; and Hugh stood up and made his bow.  His face was\nred, as much with anger as timidity, when he recognised in him the\npassenger who had sat beside the coachman.\n\n\"Perhaps, Mr Carnaby,\" said Mrs Watson, \"you will find something for\nthis young gentleman to do, when he has had his supper, while the rest\nare learning their lessons.  To-morrow he will have his own lessons; but\nto-night--\"\n\n\"There is always the multiplication-table,\" replied Mr Carnaby.  \"The\nyoung gentleman is partial to that, I fancy.\"\n\nHugh reddened, and applied himself to his bread and milk.\n\n\"Never mind a joke,\" whispered Mrs Watson.  \"We won't plague you with\nthe multiplication-table the first evening.  I will find you a book or\nsomething.  Meantime, there is a companion for you--I forgot that.\"\n\nThe good lady went down the room, and brought back a boy who seemed to\nbe doing all he could to stop crying.  He dashed his hand over his eyes\nevery minute, and could not look anybody in the face.  He had finished\nhis supper, and was at a loss what to do next, as he had only arrived\nthat morning, and did not know anybody at Crofton.  His name was Tom\nHolt, and he was ten years old.\n\nWhen they had told their names and ages, and where they came from, the\nboys did not know what to say next; and Hugh wished Phil would stop\nmurmuring over his Sallust and looking in the dictionary every minute;\nbut Mrs Watson did not forget the strangers.  She brought them Cook's\nVoyages out of the library, to amuse themselves with, on condition of\ntheir delivering the book to Mr Carnaby at bedtime.\n\nThe rest of the evening passed away very pleasantly.  Hugh told Holt a\ngreat deal about Broadstairs and the South Sea Islands, and confided to\nhim his own hopes of being a sailor, and going round the world; and, if\npossible, making his way straight through China,--the most difficult\ncountry left to travel in, he believed, except some parts of Africa.  He\ndid not want to cross the Great Desert, on account of the heat.  He knew\nsomething of what that was by the leads at home, when the sun was on\nthem.  What was the greatest heat Holt had ever felt?  Then came the\nsurprise.  Holt had last come from his uncle's farm; but he was born in\nIndia, and had lived there till eighteen months ago.  So, while Hugh had\nchattered away about the sea at Broadstairs, and the heat on the leads\nat home, his companion had come fourteen thousand miles over the ocean,\nand had felt a heat nearly as extreme as that of the Great Desert!  Holt\nwas very unassuming too.  He talked of the heat of gleaning in his\nuncle's harvest-fields, and of the kitchen when the harvest-supper was\ncooking; owning that he remembered he had felt hotter in India.  Hugh\nheaped questions upon him about his native country and the voyage; and\nHolt liked to be asked: so that the boys were not at all like strangers\njust met for the first time.  They raised their voices in the eagerness\nof their talk, from a whisper so as to be heard quite across the table,\nabove the hum and buzz of above thirty others, who were learning their\nlessons half-aloud.  At last Hugh was startled by hearing the words\n\"Prater\", \"Prater the second.\"  He was silent instantly, to Holt's great\nwonder.\n\nWithout raising his eyes from his book, Phil said, so as to be heard as\nfar as the usher,--\n\n\"Who prated, of Prater the second?  Who is Prater the third?\"\n\nThere was a laugh which provoked the usher to come and see whereabouts\nin Sallust such a passage as this was to be found.  Not finding any\nsuch, he knuckled Phil's head, and pulled his hair, till Hugh cried\nout--\n\n\"O, don't, sir!  Don't hurt him so!\"\n\n\"Do you call that hurting?  You will soon find what hurting is, when you\nbecome acquainted with our birch.  You shall have four times seven with\nour birch--Let us see,--that is your favourite number, I think.\"\n\nThe usher looked round, and almost everybody laughed.\n\n\"You see I have your secret;--four times seven,\" continued Mr Carnaby.\n\"What do you shake your head for?\"\n\n\"Because you have not my secret about four times seven.\"\n\n\"Did not I hear your father?  Eh?\"\n\n\"What did you hear my father say?  Nobody here knows what he meant?  And\nnobody need know, unless I choose to tell--which I don't.--Please don't\nteaze Phil about it, sir: for he knows no more about it than you do.\"\n\nMr Carnaby said something about the impertinence of little boys, as if\nthey could have secrets, and then declared it high time that the\nyoungsters should go to bed.  Hugh delivered Cook's Voyages into his\nhands, and then bade Phil good-night.  He was just going to put his face\nup to be kissed, but recollected in time that he was to leave off\nkissing when he went to school.  He held out his hand, but Phil seemed\nnot to see it, and only told him to be sure to lie enough on one side,\nso as to leave him room; and that he was to take the side of the bed\nnext the window.  Hugh nodded and went off, with Holt and two more, who\nslept in the same room.\n\nThe two who were not new boys were in bed in a minute; and when they saw\nHugh wash his face and hands, they sat up in bed to stare.  One of them\ntold him that he had better not do that, as the maid would be coming for\nthe light, and would leave him in the dark, and report of him if he was\nnot in bed.  So Hugh made a great splutter, and did not half dry his\nface, and left the water in the basin;--a thing which they told him was\nnot allowed.  He saw that the others had not kneeled down to say their\nprayers,--a practice which he had never omitted since he could say a\nprayer, except when he had the measles.  He knew the boys were watching\nhim; but he thought of his mother, and how she had taught him to pray at\nher knee.  He hid himself as well as he could with the scanty\nbed-curtains, and kneeled.  He could not attend to the words he said,\nwhile feeling that eyes were upon him; and before he had done, the maid\ncame in for the candle.  She waited; but when he got into bed, she told\nhim that he must be quicker to-morrow night, as she had no time to spare\nwaiting for the candle.\n\nHugh was more tired than he had ever been in his life.  This had been\nthe longest day he had ever known.  It seemed more like a week than a\nday.  Yet he could not go to sleep.  He had forgotten to ask Phil to be\nsure and wake him in time in the morning: and now he must keep awake\ntill Phil came, to say this.  Then, he could not but ask himself whether\nhe liked, and should like, being at school as much as he expected; and\nwhen he felt how very unlike home it was, and how rough everybody\nseemed, and how Phil appeared almost as if he was ashamed of him,\ninstead of helping him, he was so miserable he did not know what to do.\nHe cried bitterly,--cried till his pillow was quite wet, and he was\nalmost choked with his grief; for he tried hard not to let his sobs be\nheard.  After awhile, he felt what he might do.  Though he had kneeled\nhe had not really prayed: and if he had, God is never weary of prayers.\nIt was a happy thought to Hugh that his very best friend was with him\nstill, and that he might speak to Him at any time.  He spoke now in his\nheart; and a great comfort it was.  He said--\n\n\"O God, I am all alone here, where nobody knows me; and everything is\nvery strange and uncomfortable.  Please, make people kind to me till I\nam used to them; and keep up a brave heart in me, if they are not.  Help\nme not to mind little things; but to do my lessons well, that I may get\nto like being a Crofton boy, as I thought I should.  I love them all at\nhome very much,--better than I ever did before.  Make them love me, and\nthink of me every day,--particularly Agnes,--that they may be as glad as\nI shall be when I go home at Christmas.\"\n\nThis was the most of what he had to say; and he dropped asleep with the\nfeeling that God was listening to him.\n\nAfter a long while, as it seemed to him, though it was only an hour,\nthere was a light and some bustle in the room.  It was Phil and two\nothers coming to bed.\n\n\"O Phil!\" cried Hugh, starting bolt upright and winking with sleep,--\"I\nmeant to keep awake, to ask you to be sure and call me in the morning,\ntime enough,--quite time enough, please.\"\n\nThe others laughed; and Phil asked whether he had not seen the bell, as\nhe came; and what it should be for but to ring everybody up in the\nmorning.\n\n\"But I might not hear it,\" pleaded Hugh.\n\n\"Not hear it?  You'll soon see that.\"\n\n\"Well, but you will see that I really do wake, won't you?\"\n\n\"The bell will take care of that, I tell you,\" was all he could get from\nPhil.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. CROFTON PLAY.\n\nHugh found, in the morning, that there was no danger of his not hearing\nthe bell.  Its clang clang startled him out of a sound sleep; and he was\non his feet on the floor almost before his eyes were open.  The boys who\nwere more used to the bell did not make quite so much haste.  They\nyawned a few times, and turned out more slowly; so that Hugh had the\ngreat tin wash basin to himself longer than the rest.  There was a basin\nto every three boys; and, early as Hugh began, his companions were\nimpatient long before he had done.  At first, they waited, in curiosity\nto see what he was going to do after washing his face; when he went\nfurther, they began to quiz; but when they found that he actually\nthought of washing his feet, they hooted and groaned at him for a dirty\nbrat.\n\n\"Dirty!\" cried Hugh, facing them, amazed, \"Dirty for washing my feet!\nMother says it is a dirty trick not to wash all over every day.\"\n\nPhil told him that was stuff and nonsense here.  There was no room and\nno time for such home-doings.  The boys all washed their heads and feet\non Saturdays.  He would soon find that he might be glad to get his face\nand hands done in the mornings.\n\nThe other boys in the room were, or pretended to be, so disgusted with\nthe very idea of washing feet in a basin, that they made Hugh rinse and\nrub out the tin basin several times before they would use it, and then\nthere was a great bustle to get down-stairs at the second bell.  Hugh\npulled his brother's arm, as Phil was brushing out of the room, and\nasked, in a whisper, whether there would be time to say his prayers.\n\n\"There will be prayers in the school-room.  You must be in time for\nthem,\" said Phil.  \"You had better come with me.\"\n\n\"Do wait one moment, while I just comb my hair.\"\n\nPhil fidgeted, and others giggled, while Hugh tried to part his hair, as\nSusan had taught him.  He gave it up, and left it rough, thinking he\nwould come up and do it when there was nobody there to laugh at him.\n\nThe school-room looked chilly and dull, as there was no sunshine in it\ntill the afternoon; and still Mr Tooke was not there, as Hugh had hoped\nhe would be.  Mrs Watson and the servants came in for prayers, which\nwere well read by the usher; and then everybody went to business:--\neverybody but Hugh and Holt, who had nothing to do.  Class after class\ncame up for repetition; and this repetition seemed to the new boys an\naccomplishment they should never acquire.  They did not think that any\npractice would enable them to gabble, as everybody seemed able to gabble\nhere.  Hugh had witnessed something of it before,--Phil having been wont\nto run off at home, \"Sal, Sol, Ren et Splen,\" to the end of the passage,\nfor the admiration of his sisters, and so much to little Harry's\namusement, that Susan, however busy she might be, came to listen, and\nthen asked him to say it again, that cook might hear what he learned at\nschool.  Hugh now thought that none of them gabbled quite so fast as\nPhil: but he soon found out, by a glance or two of Phil's to one side,\nthat he was trying to astonish the new boys.  It is surprising how it\nlightened Hugh's heart to find that his brother did not quite despise,\nor feel ashamed of him, as he had begun to think: but that he even took\npains to show off.  He was sorry too when the usher spoke sharply to\nPhil, and even rapped his head with the cane, asking him what he\nspluttered out his nonsense at that rate for.  Thus ended Phil's\ndisplay; and Hugh felt as hot, and as ready to cry, as if it had\nhappened to himself.\n\nPerhaps the usher saw this; for when he called Hugh up, he was very\nkind.  He looked at the Latin grammar he had used with Miss Harold, and\nsaw by the dogs'-ears exactly how far Hugh had gone in it, and asked him\nonly what he could answer very well.  Hugh said three declensions, with\nonly one mistake.  Then he was shown the part that he was to say\nto-morrow morning; and Hugh walked away, all the happier for having\nsomething to do, like everybody else.  He was so little afraid of the\nusher, that he went back to him to ask where he had better sit.\n\n\"Sit!  O!  I suppose you must have a desk, though you have nothing to\nput in it.  If there is a spare desk, you shall have it: if not, we will\nfind a corner for you somewhere.\"\n\nSome of the boys whispered that Mrs Watson's footstool, under her\napron, would do: but the usher overheard this, and observed that it took\nsome people a good while to know a new boy; and that they might find\nthat a little fellow might be as much of a man as a big one.  And the\nusher called the oldest boy in the school, and asked him to see if there\nwas a desk for little Proctor.  There was: and Hugh put into it his two\nor three school-books, and his slate; and felt that he was now indeed a\nCrofton boy.  Then, the usher was kinder than he had expected; and he\nhad still to see Mr Tooke, of whom he was not afraid at all.  So Hugh's\nspirits rose, and he liked the prospect of breakfast as well as any boy\nin the school.\n\nThere was one more rebuff for him, first, however.  He ran up to his\nroom, to finish combing his hair, while the other boys were thronging\ninto the long room to breakfast.  He found the housemaids there, making\nthe beds; and they both cried \"Out!  Out!\" and clapped their hands at\nhim, and threatened to tell Mrs Watson of his having broken rules, if\nhe did not go this moment Hugh asked what Mrs Watson would say to his\nhair, if he went to breakfast with it as it was.  One of the maids was\ngood-natured enough to comb it for him, for once: but she said he must\ncarry a comb in his pocket; as the boys were not allowed to go to their\nrooms, except at stated hours.\n\nAt last, Hugh saw Mr Tooke.  When the boys entered school at nine\no'clock, the master was at his desk.  Hugh went up to his end of the\nroom, with a smiling face, while Tom Holt hung back; and he kept\nbeckoning Tom Holt on, having told him there was nothing to be afraid\nof.  But when, at last, Mr Tooke saw him, he made no difference between\nthe two, and seemed to forget having ever seen Hugh.  He told them he\nhoped they would be good boys, and would do credit to Crofton; and then\nhe asked Mr Carnaby to set them something to learn.  And this was all\nthey had to do with Mr Tooke for a long while.\n\nThis morning in school, from nine till twelve, seemed the longest\nmorning these little boys had ever known.  When they remembered that the\nafternoon would be as long, and every morning and afternoon for three\nmonths, their hearts sank.  Perhaps, if any one had told them that the\ntime would grow shorter and shorter by use, and at last, when they had\nplenty to do, almost too short, they would not have believed it, because\nthey could not yet feel it.  But what they now found was only what every\nboy and girl finds, on beginning school, or entering upon any new way of\nlife.\n\nMr Carnaby, who was busy with others, found it rather difficult to fill\nup their time.  When Hugh had said some Latin, and helped his companion\nto learn his first Latin lesson, and both had written a copy, and done a\nsum, Mr Carnaby could not spare them any more time or thought, and told\nthem they might do what they liked, if they only kept quiet, till school\nwas up.  So they made out the ridiculous figures which somebody had\ncarved upon their desks, and the verses, half rubbed out, which were\nscribbled inside: and then they reckoned, on their slates, how many days\nthere were before the Christmas holidays;--how many school-days, and how\nmany Sundays.  And then Hugh began to draw a steamboat in the Thames, as\nseen from the leads of his father's house; while Holt drew on his slate\nthe ship in which he came over from India.  But before they had done,\nthe clock struck twelve, school was up, and there was a general rush\ninto the playground.\n\nNow Hugh was really to see the country.  Except that the sun had shone\npleasantly into his room in the morning, through waving trees, nothing\nhad yet occurred to make him feel that he was in the country.  Now,\nhowever, he was in the open air, with trees sprinkled all over the\nlandscape, and green fields stretching away, and the old church tower\nhalf-covered with ivy.  Hugh screamed with pleasure; and nobody thought\nit odd, for almost every boy was shouting.  Hugh longed to pick up some\nof the shining brown chestnuts which he had seen yesterday in the road,\nunder the trees; and he was now cantering away to the spot, when Phil\nran after him, and roughly stopped him, saying he would get into a fine\nscrape for the first day, if he went out of bounds.\n\nHugh had forgotten there were such things as bounds, and was not at all\nglad to be reminded of them now.  He sighed as he begged Phil to show\nhim exactly where he might go and where he might not Phil did so in an\nimpatient way, and then was off to trap-ball, because his party were\nwaiting for him.\n\nThe chestnut-trees overhung one corner of the playground, within the\npaling: and in that corner Hugh found several chestnuts which had burst\ntheir sheaths, and lay among the first fallen leaves.  He pocketed them\nwith great delight, wondering that nobody had been before him to secure\nsuch a treasure.  Agnes should have some; and little Harry would find\nthem nice playthings.  They looked good to eat too; and he thought he\ncould spare one to taste; so he took out his knife, cut off the point of\na fine swelling chestnut, and tasted a bit of the inside.  Just as he\nwas making a face over it, and wondering that it was so nasty, when\nthose which his father roasted in the fire-shovel on Christmas-day were\nso good, he heard laughter behind him, and found that he was again doing\nsomething ridiculous, though he knew not what: and in a moment poor Hugh\nwas as unhappy as ever.\n\nHe ran away from the laughing boys, and went quite to the opposite\ncorner of the playground, where a good number of his schoolfellows were\nplaying ball under the orchard-wall.  Hugh ran hither and thither, like\nthe rest, trying to catch the ball; but he never could do it; and he was\njostled, and thrown down, and another boy fell over him; and he was told\nthat he knew nothing about play, and had better move off.\n\nHe did so, with a heavy heart, wondering how he was ever to be like the\nother boys, if nobody would take him in hand, and teach him to play, or\neven let him learn.  Remembering what his mother expected of him, he\ntried to sing, to prevent crying, and began to count the pales round the\nplayground, for something to do.  This presently brought him to a tree\nwhich stood on the very boundary, its trunk serving instead of two or\nthree pales.  It was only a twisted old apple-tree; but the more twisted\nand gnarled it was, the more it looked like a tree that Hugh could\nclimb; and he had always longed to climb a tree.  Glancing up, he saw a\nboy already there, sitting on the fork of two branches, reading.\n\n\"Have you a mind to come up?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I should like to try and climb a tree.  I never did.\"\n\n\"Well, this is a good one to begin with.  I'll lend you a hand; shall\nI?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't call me, `sir.'  I'm only a schoolboy, like you.  I am Dan Firth.\nCall me Firth, as I am the only one of the name here.  You are little\nProctor, I think--Proctor's brother.\"\n\n\"Yes: but, Firth, I shall pull you down, if I slip.\"\n\n\"Not you: but I'll come down, and so send you up to my seat, which is\nthe safest to begin with.  Stand off.\"\n\nFirth swung himself down, and then, showing Hugh where to plant his\nfeet, and propping him when he wanted it, he soon seated him on the\nfork, and laughed good-naturedly when Hugh waved his cap over his head,\non occasion of being up in a tree.  He let him get down and up again\nseveral times, till he could do it quite alone, and felt that he might\nhave a seat here whenever it was not occupied by any one else.\n\nWhile Hugh sat in the branches, venturing to leave hold with one hand,\nthat he might fan his hot face with his cap, Firth stood on the rail of\nthe palings, holding by the tree, and talking to him.  Firth told him\nthat this was the only tree the boys were allowed to climb, since Ned\nReeve had fallen from the great ash, and hurt his spine.  He showed what\ntrees he had himself climbed before that accident; and it made Hugh\ngiddy to think of being within eight feet of the top of the lofty elm in\nthe churchyard, which Firth had thought nothing of mounting.\n\n\"Did anybody teach you?\" asked Hugh.\n\n\"Yes; my father taught me to climb, when I was younger than you.\"\n\n\"And had you anybody to teach you games and things, when you came here?\"\n\n\"No: but I had learned a good deal of that before I came; and so I soon\nfell into the ways here.  Have you anybody to teach you?\"\n\n\"No--yes--why, no.  I thought Phil would have showed me things; but he\ndoes not seem to mind me at all.\"  And Hugh bit his lip, and fanned\nhimself faster.\n\n\"Ah!  He attends to you more than you think.\"\n\n\"Does he?  Then why--but what good does it do me?\"\n\n\"What good?  His holding off makes you push your own way.  It lets you\nmake friends for yourself.\"\n\n\"I have no friends here,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Yes, you have.  Here am I.  You would not have had me, if you had been\nat Proctor's heels at this moment.\"\n\n\"Will you be my friend, then?\"\n\n\"That I will.\"\n\n\"What, a great boy like you, that sits reading in a tree!  But I may\nread here beside you.  You said there was room for two.\"\n\n\"Ay; but you must not use it yet,--at least, not often, if you wish to\ndo well here.  Everybody knows I can play at anything.  From the time I\nbecame captain of the wall at fives, I have had liberty to do what I\nlike, without question.  But you must show that you are up to play,\nbefore they will let you read in peace and quiet.\"\n\n\"But how can I, if--if--\"\n\n\"Once show your spirit,--prove that you can shift for yourself, and you\nwill find Phil open out wonderfully.  He and you will forget all his\nshyness then.  Once show him that he need not be ashamed of you--\"\n\n\"Ashamed of me!\" cried Hugh, firing up.\n\n\"Yes.  Little boys are looked upon as girls in a school till they show\nthat they are little men.  And then again, you have been brought up with\ngirls,--have not you?\"\n\n\"To be sure; and so was he.\"\n\n\"And half the boys here, I dare say.  Well, they are called Bettys\ntill--\"\n\n\"I am not a Betty,\" cried Hugh, flashing again.\n\n\"They suppose you are, because you part your hair, and do as you have\nbeen used to do at home.\"\n\n\"What business have they with my hair?  I might as well call them Bruins\nfor wearing theirs shaggy.\"\n\n\"Very true.  They will let you and your hair alone when they see what\nyou are made of; and then Phil will--\"\n\n\"He will own me when I don't want it; and now, when he might help me,\nthere he is, far off, never caring about what becomes of me!\"\n\n\"O yes, he does.  He is watching you all the time.  You and he will have\nit all out some day before Christmas, and then you will see how he\nreally cares about you.  Really your hair is very long,--too like a\ngirl's.  Shall I cut it for you?\"\n\n\"I should like it,\" said Hugh, \"but I don't want the boys to think I am\nafraid of them; or to begin giving up to them.\"\n\n\"You are right there.  We will let it alone now, and cut it when it\nsuits our convenience.\"\n\n\"What a nice place this is, to be sure!\" cried Hugh, as the feeling of\nloneliness went off.  \"But the rooks do not make so much noise as I\nexpected.\"\n\n\"You will find what they can do in that way when spring comes,--when\nthey are building.\"\n\n\"And when may we go out upon the heath, and into the fields where the\nlambs are?\"\n\n\"We go long walks on Saturday afternoons; but you do not expect to see\nyoung lambs in October, do you?\"\n\n\"O, I forgot I never can remember the seasons for things.\"\n\n\"That shows you are a Londoner.  You will learn all those things here.\nIf you look for hares in our walks, you may chance to see one; or you\nmay start a pheasant; but take care you don't mention lambs, or\ngoslings, or cowslips, or any spring things; or you will never hear the\nlast of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you: but what will poor Holt do?  He is from India, and he knows\nvery little about our ways.\"\n\n\"They may laugh at him; but they will not despise him as they might a\nLondoner.  Being an Indian, and being a Londoner, are very different\nthings.\"\n\n\"And yet how proud the Londoners are over the country!  It is very odd.\"\n\n\"People are proud of their own ways all the world over.  You will be\nproud of being a Crofton boy, by-and-by.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am now, a little,\" said Hugh, blushing.\n\n\"What, already?  Ah!  You will do, I see.  I have known old people proud\nof their age, and young people of their youth.  I have seen poor people\nproud of their poverty; and everybody has seen rich people proud of\ntheir wealth.  I have seen happy people proud of their prosperity, and\nthe afflicted proud of their afflictions.  Yes; people can always manage\nto be proud: so you have boasted of being a Londoner up to this time;\nand from this time you will hold your head high as a Crofton boy.\"\n\n\"How long?  Till when?\"\n\n\"Ah!  Till when?  What next!  What do you mean to be afterwards?\"\n\n\"A soldier, or a sailor, or a great traveller, or something of that\nkind.  I mean to go quite round the world, like Captain Cook.\"\n\n\"Then you will come home, proud of having been round the world; and you\nwill meet with some old neighbour who boasts of having spent all his\nlife in the house he was born in.\"\n\n\"Old Mr Dixon told mother that of himself, very lately.  Oh dear, how\noften does the postman come?\"\n\n\"You want a letter from home, do you?  But you left them only yesterday\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to believe that,--it seems such an immense time!  But\nwhen does the postman come?\"\n\n\"Any day when he has letters to bring,--at about four in the afternoon.\nWe see him come, from the school-room; but we do not know who the\nletters are for till school breaks up at five.\"\n\n\"O dear!\" cried Hugh, thinking what the suspense must be, and the\ndisappointment at last to twenty boys, perhaps, for one that was\ngratified.  Firth advised him to write a letter home before he began to\nexpect one.  If he did not like to ask the usher, he himself would rule\nthe paper for him, and he could write a bit at a time, after his lessons\nwere done in the evening, till the sheet was full.\n\nHugh then told his grievance about the usher, and Firth thought that\nthough it was not wise in Hugh to prate about Crofton on the top of the\ncoach, it was worse to sit by and listen without warning, unless the\nlistener meant to hold his own tongue.  But he fancied the usher had\nsince heard something which made him sorry; and the best way now was for\nHugh to bear no malice, and remember nothing more of the affair than to\nbe discreet in his future journeys.\n\n\"What is the matter there?\" cried Hugh.  \"O dear!  Something very\nterrible must have happened.  How that boy is screaming!\"\n\n\"It is only Lamb again,\" replied Firth.  \"You will soon get used to his\nscreaming.  He is a very passionate boy--I never saw such a passionate\nfellow.\"\n\n\"But what are they doing to him?\"\n\n\"Somebody is putting him into a passion, I suppose.  There is always\nsomebody to do that.\"\n\n\"What a shame!\" cried Hugh.\n\n\"Yes: I see no wit in it,\" replied Firth.  \"Anybody may do it.  You have\nonly to hold your little finger up to put him in a rage.\"\n\nHugh thought Firth was rather cool about the matter.  But Firth was not\nso cool when the throng opened for a moment, and showed what was really\ndone to the angry boy.  Only his head appeared above ground.  His\nschoolfellows had put him into a hole they had dug, and had filled it up\nto his chin, stamping down the earth, so that the boy was perfectly\nhelpless, while wild with rage.\n\n\"That is too bad!\" cried Firth.  \"That would madden a saint.\"\n\nAnd he jumped down from the paling and ran towards the crowd.  Hugh,\nforgetting his height from the ground, stood up in the tree, almost as\nangry as Lamb himself, and staring with all his might to see what he\ncould.  He saw Firth making his way through the crowd, evidently\nremonstrating, if not threatening.  He saw him snatch a spade from a boy\nwho was flourishing it in Lamb's face.  He saw that Firth was digging,\nthough half-a-dozen boys had thrown themselves on his back, and hung on\nhis arms.  He saw that Firth persevered till Lamb had got his right arm\nout of the ground, and was striking everywhere within reach.  Then he\nsaw Firth dragged down and away, while the boys made a circle round\nLamb, putting a foot or hand within his reach, and then snatching it\naway again, till the boy yelled with rage at the mockery.\n\nHugh could look on no longer.  He scrambled down from the tree,\nscampered to the spot, burst through the throng, and seized Lamb's hand.\nLamb struck him a heavy blow, taking him for an enemy; but Hugh cried\n\"I am your friend,\" seized his hand again, and tugged till he was first\nred and then black in the face, and till Lamb had worked his shoulders\nout of the hole, and seemed likely to have the use of his other arm in a\ntrice.\n\nLamb's tormentors at first let Hugh alone in amazement; but they were\nnot long in growing angry with him too.  They hustled him--they pulled\nhim all ways--they tripped him up; but Hugh's spirit was roused, and\nthat brought his body up to the struggle again and again.  He wrenched\nhimself free, he scrambled to his feet again, as often as he was thrown\ndown; and in a few minutes he had plenty of support.  Phil was taking\nhis part, and shielding him from many blows.  Firth had got Lamb out of\nthe hole, and the party against the tormentors was now so strong that\nthey began to part off till the struggle ceased.  Firth kept his grasp\nof the spade; for Lamb's passion still ran so high that there was no\nsaying what might be the consequences of leaving any dangerous weapon\nwithin his reach.  He was still fuming and stamping, Hugh gazing at him\nthe while in wonder and fear.\n\n\"There stands your defender, Lamb,\" said Firth, \"thinking he never saw a\nboy in a passion before.  Come, have done with it for his sake: be a\nman, as he is.  Here, help me to fill up this hole--both of you.  Stamp\ndown the earth, Lamb.  Tread it well--tread your anger well down into\nit.  Think of this little friend of yours here--a Crofton boy only\nyesterday.\"\n\nLamb did help to fill the hole, but he did not say a word--not one word\nto anybody till the dinner-bell rang.  Then, at the pump, where the\nparty were washing their hot and dirty and bruised hands, he held out\nhis hand to Hugh, muttering, with no very good grace--\n\n\"I don't know what made you help me, but I will never be in a passion\nwith you;--unless you put me out, that is.\"\n\nHugh replied that he had come to help because he never could bear to see\nanybody _made worse_.  He always tried at home to keep the little boys\nand girls off \"drunk old Tom,\" as he was called in the neighbourhood.\nIt was such a shame to make anybody worse!  Lamb looked as if he was\ngoing to fly at Hugh now: but Firth put his arm round Hugh's neck, and\ndrew him into the house, saying in his ear--\n\n\"Don't say any more that you have no friends here.  You have me for one;\nand you might have had another--two in one morning--but for your plain\nspeaking about drunk old Tom.\"\n\n\"Did I say any harm?\"\n\n\"No--no harm,\" replied Firth, laughing.  \"You will do, my boy--when you\nhave got through a few scrapes.  I'm your friend, at any rate.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. FIRST RAMBLE.\n\nHugh's afternoon lessons were harder than those of the morning; and in\nthe evening he found he had so much to do that there was very little\ntime left for writing his letter home.  Some time there was, however;\nand Firth did not forget to rule his paper, and to let Hugh use his ink.\nHugh had been accustomed to copy the prints he found in the Voyages and\nTravels he read; and he could never see a picture of a savage but he\nwanted to copy it.  He was thus accustomed to a pretty free use of his\nslate-pencil.  He now thought that it would save a great deal of\ndescription if he sent a picture or two in his letter: so he flourished\noff, on the first page, a sketch of Mr Tooke sitting at his desk at the\ntop of the school, and of Mr Carnaby standing at his desk at the bottom\nof the school.\n\nThe next evening he made haste to fill up the sheet, for he found his\nbusiness increasing upon his hands so fast that he did not know when he\nshould get his letter off, if he did not despatch it at once.  He was\njust folding it up when Tom Holt observed that it was a pity not to put\nsome words into the mouths of the figures, to make them more animated;\nand he showed Hugh, by the curious carvings of their desks, how to put\nwords into the mouths of figures.  Hugh then remembered having seen this\ndone in the caricatures in the print-shops in London; and he seized on\nthe idea.  He put into Mr Tooke's mouth the words which were oftenest\nheard from him, \"Proceed, gentlemen;\" and into Mr Carnaby's, \"Hold your\ndin.\"\n\nFirth was too busy with his sense-verses to mind the little boys, as\nthey giggled, with their heads close together, over Hugh's sheet of\npaper; but the usher was never too busy to be aware of any fun which\nmight possibly concern his dignity.  He had his eye on the new boys the\nwhole while.  He let Hugh direct his letter, and paint up a stroke or\ntwo which did not look so well as the rest; and it was not till Hugh was\nrolling the wafer about on his tongue that he interfered.  Mr Carnaby\nthen came up, tapped Hugh's head, told him not to get on so fast, for\nthat every letter must be looked over before it went to the post.  While\nsaying this, he took the letter, and put it into his waistcoat pocket.\nIn vain Hugh begged to have it again, saying he would write another.\nThe more he begged, and the more dismayed Tom Holt looked, the less Mr\nCarnaby would attend to either.  Firth let himself be interrupted to\nhear the case: but he could do nothing in it.  It was a general rule,\nwhich he thought every boy had known; and it was too late now to prevent\nthe letter being looked over.\n\nMr Carnaby was so angry at the liberty Hugh had taken with his face and\nfigure, that, in spite of all prayers, and a good many tears, he walked\nup the school with the letter, followed by poor Hugh, as soon as Mr\nTooke had taken his seat next morning.  Hugh thought that Holt, who had\nput him up to the most offensive part of the pictures, might have borne\nhim company; but Holt was a timid boy, and he really had not courage to\nleave his seat.  So Hugh stood alone, awaiting Mr Tooke's awful words,\nwhile the whole of the first class looked up from their books, in\nexpectation of what was to happen.  They waited some time for the\nmaster's words; for he was trying to help laughing.  He and Mr Carnaby\nwere so much alike in the pictures, and both so like South Sea\nislanders, that it was impossible to help laughing at the thought of\nthis sketch going abroad as a representation of the Crofton masters.  At\nlast all parties laughed aloud, and Mr Tooke handed Hugh his\nwafer-glass, and bade him wafer up his letter, and by all means send it.\nMr Carnaby could not remain offended if his principal was not angry:\nso here the matter ended, except that Hugh made some strong resolutions\nabout his future letters, and that the corners of the master's mouth\nwere seen to be out of their usual order several times in the course of\nthe morning.\n\nThis incident, and everything which haunted Hugh's mind, and engrossed\nhis attention, was a serious evil to him; for his business soon grew to\nbe more than his habit of mind was equal to.  In a few days, he learned\nto envy the boys (and they were almost the whole school) who could fix\ntheir attention completely and immediately on the work before them, and\nrelax as completely, when it was accomplished.  When his eyes were\nwandering, they observed boy after boy frowning over his dictionary, or\nrepeating to himself, earnestly and without pause; and presently the\nbusiness was done, and the learner at ease, feeling confident that he\nwas ready to meet his master.  After double the time had passed Hugh was\nstill trying to get the meaning of his lesson into his head--going over\nthe same words a dozen times, without gaining any notion of their\nmeaning--suffering, in short from his long habit of inattention at home.\nHe did now try hard; but he seemed to get only headaches for his pains.\nHis brother saw enough to make him very sorry for Hugh before ten days\nwere over.  He might not, perhaps, have been struck with his anxious\ncountenance, his frequent starts, and his laying his head down on his\ndesk because it ached so, if it had not been for what happened at night.\nSometimes Hugh started out of bed, and began to dress, when the elder\nboys went up with their light, only an hour after the younger ones.\nSometimes he would begin saying his syntax in the middle of the night,\nfancying he was standing before Mr Carnaby; and once he walked in his\nsleep as far as the head of the stairs, and then suddenly woke, and\ncould not make out where he was.  Phil should have told Mr Tooke of\nthese things; but Hugh was so very anxious that nobody should know of\nhis \"tricks\" (as the boys in his room called his troubles), that Phil\nonly mentioned the matter to Mrs Watson, who had known so many bad\nsleepers among little boys, and had so little idea that the habit was\nanything new, that she took scarcely any notice of it.  She had his hair\ncut very short and close, and saw that he took a moderate supper, and\nwas satisfied that all would be well.  Hugh did not part with his hair\ntill he had joked himself about its length as much as any one could quiz\nhim for it.  When he had pulled it down over the end of his nose, and\npeeped through it, like an owl out of an ivy-bush, he might be supposed\nto part with it voluntarily, and not because he was laughed at.\n\nPhil's observation of his brother's toil and trouble led him to give him\nsome help.  Almost every day he would hear Hugh say his lesson--or try\nto say it; for the poor boy seldom succeeded.  Phil sometimes called him\nstupid, and sometimes refrained from saying so, whatever he might think;\nbut there really was very little difference in the result, whether Phil\nheard the lessons beforehand or not; and it gave Joe Cape a great\nadvantage over Phil that he had no little brother to attend to.\nConsidering how selfish rivalship is apt to make boys (and even men), it\nwas perhaps no wonder that Phil sometimes kept out of Hugh's way at the\nright hour, saying to himself that his proper business was to do his\nlessons, and get or keep ahead of Joe Cape; and that Hugh must take his\nchance, and work his own way, as other boys had to do.  This conduct\nmight not be wondered at in Phil; but it hurt Hugh, and made him do his\nlessons all the worse.  He did not like to expose his brother's\nunkindness to any one, or he would oftener have asked Firth to help him.\nFirth, too, had plenty of work of his own to do.  More than once,\nhowever, Firth met the little lad, wandering about, with his grammar in\nhis hand, in search of the hidden Phil; and then Firth would stop him,\nand sit down with him, and have patience, and give him such clear\nexplanations, such good examples of the rules he was to learn, that it\nall became easy, and Hugh found his lessons were to him only what those\nof other boys seemed to them.  Still, however, and at the best, Hugh\nwas, as a learner, far too much at the mercy of circumstances--the\nvictim of what passed before his eyes, or was said within his hearing.\n\nBoys who find difficulty in attending to their lessons are sure to be\nmore teased with interruptions than any others.  Holt had not the habit\nof learning; and he and Hugh were continually annoyed by the boys who\nsat near them watching how they got on, and making remarks upon them.\nOne day, Mr Tooke was called out of the school-room to a visitor, and\nMr Carnaby went up to take the master's place, and hear his class.\nThis was too good an opportunity for the boys below to let slip; and\nthey began to play tricks,--most of them directed against Hugh and Tom\nHolt.  One boy, Warner, began to make the face that always made Holt\nlaugh, however he tried to be grave.  Page drew a caricature of Mrs\nWatson on his slate, and held it up; and Davison took a mask out of his\ndesk, and even ventured to tie it on, as if it had not been school-time.\n\n\"I declare I can't learn my lesson--'tis too bad!\" cried Hugh.\n\n\"'Tis a shame!\" said Tom Holt, sighing for breath after his struggle not\nto laugh.  \"We shall never be ready.\"\n\nHugh made gestures of indignation at the boys, which only caused worse\nfaces to be made, and the mask to nod.\n\n\"We wont look at them,\" proposed Holt.  \"Let us cover our eyes, and not\nlook up at all.\"\n\nHugh put his hands before his eyes; but still his mind's eye saw the\ngrinning mask, and his lesson did not get on.  Besides, a piece of wet\nsponge lighted on the very page he was learning from.  He looked up\nfiercely, to see who had thrown it.  It was no other than Tooke, who\nbelonged to that class:--it was Tooke, to judge by his giggle, and his\npretending to hide his face, as if ashamed.  Hugh tossed back the\nsponge, so as to hit Tooke on the nose.  Then Tooke was angry, and threw\nit again, and the sponge passed backwards and forwards several times:\nfor Hugh was by this time very angry,--boiling with indignation at the\nhardship of not being able to learn his lesson, when he really would if\nhe could.  While the sponge was still passing to and fro, Mr Carnaby's\nvoice was heard from the far end of the room, desiring Warner, Page,\nDavison, and Tooke to be quiet, and let the boys alone till Mr Tooke\ncame in, when Mr Tooke would take his own measures.\n\nHugh, wondering how Mr Carnaby knew, at that distance, what was going\non, found that Holt was no longer by his side.  In a moment, Holt\nreturned to his seat, flushed and out of breath.  A very slight hiss was\nheard from every form near, as he came down the room.\n\n\"O!  Holt!  You have been telling tales!\" cried Hugh.\n\n\"Telling tales!\" exclaimed Holt, in consternation, for Holt knew nothing\nof school ways.  \"I never thought of that.  They asked me to tell Mr\nCarnaby that we could not learn our lessons.\"\n\n\"They!  Who?  I am sure I never asked you.\"\n\n\"No; you did not: but Harvey and Prince did,--and Gillingham.  They said\nMr Carnaby would soon make those fellows quiet; and they told me to\ngo.\"\n\n\"You hear!  They are calling you `tell-tale.'  That will be your name\nnow.  Oh, Holt!  You should not have told tales.  However, I will stand\nby you,\" Hugh continued, seeing the terror that Holt was in.\n\n\"I meant no harm,\" said Holt, trembling.  \"Was not it a shame that they\nwould not let us learn our lessons?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was--but--\"\n\nAt this moment Mr Tooke entered the room.  As he passed the forms, the\nboys were all bent over their books, as if they could think of nothing\nelse.  Mr Tooke walked up the room to his desk, and Mr Carnaby walked\ndown the room to _his_ desk; and then Mr Carnaby said, quite aloud,--\n\n\"Mr Tooke, sir.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\nHere Holt sprang from his desk, and ran to the usher, and besought him\nnot to say a word about what Warner's class had been doing.  He even\nhung on Mr Carnaby's arm in entreaty; but Mr Carnaby shook him off,\nand commanded him back to his seat.  Then the whole school heard Mr\nTooke told about the wry faces and the mask, and the trouble of the\nlittle boys.  Mr Tooke was not often angry; but when he was, his face\ngrew white, and his lips trembled.  His face was white now.  He stood\nup, and called before him the little boy who had informed.  Hugh chose\nto go with Holt, though Holt had not gone up with him about the letter,\nthe other day; and Holt felt how kind this was.  Mr Tooke desired to\nknow who the offenders were; and as they were named, he called to them\nto stand up in their places.  Then came the sentence.  Mr Tooke would\nnever forgive advantage being taken of his absence.  If there were boys\nwho could not be trusted while his back was turned, they must be made to\nremember him when he was out of sight, by punishment.  Page must remain\nin school after hours, to learn twenty lines of Virgil; Davison twenty;\nTooke forty--\n\nHere everybody looked round to see how Tooke bore his father being so\nangry with him.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" cried one boy, \"I saw little Proctor throw a sponge at\nTooke.  He did it twice.\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" answered Tooke.  \"I threw it at him first.  It is my\nsponge.\"\n\n\"And Warner,\" continued the master, as if he had not heard the\ninterruption, \"considering that Warner has got off too easily for many\npranks of late,--Warner seventy.\"\n\nSeventy!  The idea of having anybody condemned, through him, to learn\nseventy lines of Latin by heart, made Holt so miserable that the word\nseventy seemed really to prick his very ears.  Though Mr Tooke's face\nwas still white, Holt ventured up to him, \"Pray, sir--\"\n\n\"Not a word of intercession for those boys,\" said the master.  \"I will\nnot hear a word in their favour.\"\n\n\"Then, sir--\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"I only want to say, then, that Proctor told no tales, sir.  I did not\nmean any harm, sir, but I told because--\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" cried Hugh, afraid that he would now be telling of\nHarvey, Prince, and Gillingham, who had persuaded him to go up.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with that.  That is your affair,\" said the master,\nsending the boys back to their seats.\n\nPoor Holt had cause to rue this morning, for long after.  He was weary\nof the sound of hissing, and of the name \"tell-tale;\" and the very boys\nwho had prompted him to go up were at first silent, and then joined\nagainst him.  He complained to Hugh of the difficulty of knowing what it\nwas right to do.  He had been angry on Hugh's account chiefly; and he\nstill thought it _was_ very unjust to hinder their lessons, when they\nwished not to be idle: and yet they were all treating him as if he had\ndone something worse than the boys with the mask.  Hugh thought all this\nwas true: but he believed it was settled among schoolboys (though Holt\nhad never had the opportunity of knowing it) that it was a braver thing\nfor boys to bear any teasing from one another than to call in the power\nof the master to help.  A boy who did that was supposed not to be able\nto take care of himself; and for this he was despised, besides being\ndisliked, for having brought punishment upon his companions.\n\nHolt wished Hugh had not been throwing sponges at the time:--he wished\nHugh had prevented his going up.  He would take good care how he told\ntales again.\n\n\"You had better say so,\" advised Hugh; \"and then they will see that you\nhad never been at school, and did not know how to manage.\"\n\nThe first Saturday had been partly dreaded, and partly longed for, by\nHugh.  He had longed for the afternoon's ramble; but Saturday morning\nwas the time for saying tables, among other things.  Nothing happened as\nhe had expected.  The afternoon was so rainy that there was no going\nout; and, as for the tables, he was in a class of five; and \"four times\nseven\" did not come to him in regular course.  Eight times seven did,\nand he said \"fifty-six\" with great satisfaction, Mr Carnaby asked him\nafterwards the dreaded question, but he was on his guard; and as he\nanswered it right, and the usher had not found out the joke, he hoped he\nshould hear no more of the matter.\n\nThe next Saturday was fine, and at last he was to have the walk he\nlonged for.  The weekly repetitions were over, dinner was done, Mr\nCarnaby appeared with his hat on, the whole throng burst into the open\nair, and out of bounds, and the new boys were wild with expectation and\ndelight.  When they had passed the churchyard and the green, and were\nwading through the sandy road which led up to the heath, Firth saw Hugh\nrunning and leaping hither and thither, not knowing what to do with his\nspirits.  Firth called him, and putting his arm round Hugh's neck, so as\nto keep him prisoner, said he did not know how he might want his\nstrength before he got home, and he had better not spend it on a bit of\nsandy road.  So Hugh was made to walk quietly, and gained his breath\nbefore the breezy heath was reached.\n\nOn the way, he saw that a boy of the name of Dale, whom he had never\nparticularly observed before, was a good deal teased by some boys who\nkept crossing their hands before them, and curtseying like girls,\ntalking in a mincing way, and calling one another Amelia, with great\naffectation.  Dale tried to get away, but he was followed, whichever way\nhe turned.\n\n\"What do they mean by that?\" inquired Hugh of Firth.\n\n\"Dale has a sister at a school not far off, and her name is Amelia; and\nshe came to see him to-day.  Ah!  You have not found out yet that boys\nare laughed at about their sisters, particularly if the girls have fine\nnames.\"\n\n\"What a shame!\" cried Hugh; words which he had used very often already\nsince he came to Crofton.\n\nHe broke from Firth, ran up to Dale, and said to him, in a low voice, \"I\nhave two sisters, and one of them is called Agnes.\"\n\n\"Don't let them come to see you, then, or these fellows will quiz you as\nthey do me.  As if I could help having a sister Amelia!\"\n\n\"Why, you are not sorry for that?  You would not wish your sister dead,\nor not born, would you?\"\n\n\"No; but I wish she was not hereabouts: that is, I wish she had not come\nup to the pales, with the maid-servant behind her, for everybody to see.\nAnd then, when Mr Tooke sent us into the orchard together, some spies\nwere peeping over the wall at us all the time.\"\n\n\"I only wish Agnes would come,\" cried Hugh, \"and I would--\"\n\n\"Ah!  You think so now; but depend upon it, you would like much better\nto see her at home.  Why, her name is finer than my sister's!  I wonder\nwhat girls ever have such names for!\"\n\n\"I don't see that these names are finer than some boys' names.  There's\nFrazer, is not his name Colin?  And then there's Hercules Fisticuff--\"\n\n\"Why, you know--to be sure you know that is a nick-name?\" said Dale.\n\n\"Is it?  I never thought of that,\" replied Hugh.  \"What is his real\nname?\"\n\n\"Samuel Jones.  However, there is Colin Frazer--and Fry, his name is\nAugustus Adolphus; I will play them off the next time they quiz Amelia.\nHow old is your sister Agnes?\"\n\nThen the two boys wandered off among the furze bushes, talking about\ntheir homes; and in a little while they had so opened their hearts to\neach other, that they felt as if they had always been friends.  Nobody\nthought any more about them when once the whole school was dispersed\nover the heath.  Some boys made for a hazel copse, some way beyond the\nheath, in hopes of finding a few nuts already ripe.  Others had boats to\nfloat on the pond.  A large number played leap-frog, and some ran races.\nMr Carnaby threw himself down on a soft couch of wild thyme, on a\nrising ground, and took out his book.  So Dale and Hugh felt themselves\nunobserved, and they chatted away at a great rate.  Not but that an\ninterruption or two did occur.  They fell in with a flock of geese, and\nHugh did not much like their appearance, never having heard a goose make\na noise before.  He had eaten roast goose, and he had seen geese in the\nfeathers at the poulterers'; but he had never seen them alive, and\nstretching their necks at passengers.  He flinched at the first moment.\nDale, who never imagined that a boy who was not afraid of his\nschoolfellows could be afraid of geese, luckily mistook the movement,\nand said, \"Ay, get a switch,--a bunch of furze will do, and we will be\nrid of the noisy things.\"\n\nHe drove them away, and Hugh had now learned, for ever, how much noise\ngeese can make, and how little they are to be feared.\n\nThey soon came upon some creatures which were larger and stronger, and\nwith which Hugh was no better acquainted.  Some cows were grazing, or\nhad been grazing, till a party of boys came up.  They were now restless,\nmoving uneasily about, so that Dale himself hesitated for a moment which\nway to go.  Lamb was near,--the passionate boy, who was nobody's friend,\nand who was therefore seldom at play with others.  He was also something\nof a coward, as any one might know from his frequent bullying.  He and\nHolt happened to be together at this time; and it was their appearance\nof fright at the restless cows which frightened Hugh.  One cow at last\nbegan to trot towards them at a pretty good rate.  Lamb ran off to the\nright, and the two little boys after him, though Dale pulled at Hugh's\nhand to make him stand still, as Dale chose to do himself.  He pulled in\nvain--Hugh burst away, and off went the three boys, over the hillocks\nand through the furze, the cow trotting at some distance behind.  They\ndid not pause till Lamb had led them off the heath into a deep lane,\ndifferent from the one by which they had come.  The cow stopped at a\npatch of green grass, just at the entrance of the hollow way; and the\nrunners therefore could take breath.\n\n\"Now we are here,\" said Lamb, \"I will show you a nice place,--a place\nwhere we can get something nice.  How thirsty I am!\"\n\n\"And so am I,\" declared Holt, smacking his dry tongue.  Hugh's mouth was\nvery dry too, between the run and the fright.\n\n\"Well, then, come along with me, and I will show you,\" said Lamb.\n\nHugh thought they ought not to go farther from the heath: but Lamb said\nthey would get back by another way,--through a gate belonging to a\nfriend of his.  They could not get back the way they came, because the\ncow was there still.  He walked briskly on till they came to a cottage,\nover whose door swung a sign; and on the sign was a painting of a bottle\nand a glass, and a heap of things which were probably meant for cakes,\nas there were cakes in the window.  Here Lamb turned in, and the woman\nseemed to know him well.  She smiled, and closed the door behind the\nthree boys, and asked them to sit down: but Lamb said there was no time\nfor that to-day,--she must be quick.  He then told the boys that they\nwould have some ginger-beer.\n\n\"But may we?\" asked the little boys.\n\n\"To be sure; who is to prevent us?  You shall see how you like\nginger-beer when you are thirsty.\"\n\nThe woman declared that it was the most wholesome thing in the world;\nand if the young gentleman did not find it so, she would never ask him\nto taste her ginger-beer again.  Hugh thanked them both; but he did not\nfeel quite comfortable.  He looked at Holt, to find out what he thought:\nbut Holt was quite engrossed with watching the woman untwisting the wire\nof the first bottle.  The cork did not fly; indeed there was some\ndifficulty in getting it out: so Lamb waived his right, as the eldest,\nto drink first; and the little boys were so long in settling which\nshould have it, that the little spirit there was had all gone off before\nHugh began to drink; and he did not find ginger-beer such particularly\ngood stuff as Lamb had said.  He would have liked a drink of water\nbetter.  The next bottle was very brisk: so Lamb seized upon it; and the\nfroth hung round his mouth when he had done: but Holt was no better off\nwith his than Hugh had been.  They were both urged to try their luck\nagain.  Hugh would not: but Holt did once; and Lamb, two or three times.\nThen the woman offered them some cakes upon a plate: and the little\nboys thanked her, and took each one.  Lamb put some in his pocket, and\nadvised the others to do the same, as they had no time to spare.  He\nkept some room in his pocket, however, for some plums; and told the boys\nthat they might carry theirs in their handkerchiefs, or in their caps,\nif they would take care to have finished before they came within sight\nof the usher.  He then asked the woman to let them out upon the heath\nthrough her garden gate; and she said she certainly would when they had\npaid.  She then stood drumming with her fingers upon the table, and\nlooking through the window, as if waiting.\n\n\"Come, Proctor, you have half-a-crown,\" said Lamb.  \"Out with it!\"\n\n\"My half-crown!\" exclaimed Proctor.  \"You did not say I had anything to\npay.\"\n\n\"As if you did not know that, without my telling you!  You don't think\npeople give away their good things, I suppose!  Come,--where's your\nhalf-crown?  My money is all at home.\"\n\nHolt had nothing with him either.  Lamb asked the woman what there was\nto pay.  She seemed to count and consider; and Holt told Hugh afterwards\nthat he saw Lamb wink at her.  She then said that the younger gentlemen\nhad had the most plums and cakes.  The charge was a shilling a piece for\nthem, and sixpence for Master Lamb:--half-a-crown exactly.  Hugh\nprotested he never meant anything like this, and that he wanted part of\nhis half-crown to buy a comb with; and he would have emptied out the\ncakes and fruit he had left; but the woman stopped him, saying that she\nnever took back what she had sold.  Lamb hurried him, too, declaring\nthat their time was up; and he even thrust his finger and thumb into\nHugh's inner pocket, and took out the half-crown, which he gave to the\nwoman.  He was sure that Hugh could wait for his comb till Holt paid\nhim, and the woman said she did not see that any more combing was\nwanted: the young gentleman's hair looked so pretty as it was.  She then\nshowed them through the garden, and gave them each a marigold\nfull-blown.  She unlocked her gate, pushed them through, locked it\nbehind them, and left them to hide their purchases as well as they\ncould.  Though the little boys stuffed their pockets till the ripest\nplums burst, and wetted the linings, they could not dispose of them all;\nand they were obliged to give away a good many.\n\nHugh went in search of his new friend, and drew him aside from the rest\nto relate his trouble.  Dale wondered he had not found out Lamb before\nthis, enough to refuse to follow his lead.  Lamb would never pay a\npenny.  He always spent the little money he had upon good things, the\nfirst day or two; and then he got what he could out of any one who was\nsilly enough to trust him.\n\n\"But,\" said Hugh, \"the only thing we had to do with each other before\nwas by my being kind to him.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference,\" said Dale.\n\n\"But what a bad boy he must be!  To be sure, he will pay me, when he\nknows how much I want a comb.\"\n\n\"He will tell you to buy it out of your five shillings.  You let him\nknow you had five shillings in Mrs Watson's hands.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he knows how I mean to spend that,--for presents to carry home\nat Christmas.  But I'll never tell him anything again.  Oh!  Dale!  Do\nyou really think he will never pay me?\"\n\n\"He never pays anybody; that is all I know.  Come,--forget it all, as\nfast as you can.  Let us go and see if we can get any nuts.\"\n\nHugh did not at all succeed in his endeavours to forget his adventure.\nThe more he thought about it, the worse it seemed; and the next time he\nspoke to Holt, and told him to remember that he owed him a shilling,\nHolt said he did not know that,--he did not mean to spend a shilling;\nand it was clear that it was only his fear of Hugh's speaking to Mrs\nWatson or the usher, that prevented his saying outright that he should\nnot pay it.  Hugh felt very hot, and bit his lip to make his voice\nsteady when he told Dale, on the way home, that he did not believe he\nshould ever see any part of his half-crown again.  Dale thought so too;\nbut he advised him to do nothing more than keep the two debtors up to\nthe remembrance of their debt.  If he told so powerful a person as\nFirth, it would be almost as much tale-telling as if he went to the\nmaster at once; and Hugh himself had no inclination to expose his folly\nto Phil, who was already quite sufficiently ashamed of his inexperience.\nSo poor Hugh threw the last of his plums to some cottager's children on\nthe green, in his way home; and, when he set foot within bounds again,\nhe heartily wished that this Saturday afternoon had been rainy too; for\nany disappointment would have been better than this scrape.\n\nWhile learning his lessons for Monday, he forgot the whole matter; and\nthen he grew merry over the great Saturday night's washing; but after he\nwas in bed, it flashed upon him that he should meet uncle and aunt Shaw\nin church to-morrow, and they would speak to Phil and him after church;\nand his uncle might ask after the half-crown.  He determined not to\nexpose his companions, at any rate: but his uncle would be displeased;\nand this thought was so sad that Hugh cried himself to sleep.  His uncle\nand aunt were at church the next morning; and Hugh could not forget the\nginger-beer, or help watching his uncle: so that, though he tried\nseveral times to attend to the sermon; he knew nothing about it when it\nwas done.  His uncle observed in the churchyard that they must have had\na fine ramble the day before; but did not say anything about\npocket-money.  Neither did he name a day for his nephews to visit him,\nthough he said they must come before the days grew much shorter.  So\nHugh thought he had got off very well thus far.  In the afternoon,\nhowever, Mrs Watson, who invited him and Holt into her parlour, to look\nover the pictures in her great Bible, was rather surprised to find how\nlittle Hugh could tell her of the sermon, considering how much he had\nremembered the Sunday before.  She had certainly thought that to-day's\nsermon had been the simpler, and the more interesting to young people,\nof the two.  Her conversation with Hugh did him good, however.  It\nreminded him of his mother's words, and of her expectations from him;\nand it made him resolve to bear, not only his loss, but any blame which\nmight come upon him silently, and without betraying anybody.  He had\nalready determined, fifty times within the twenty-four hours, never to\nbe so weakly led again, when his own mind was doubtful, as he had felt\nit all the time from leaving the heath to getting back to it again.  He\nbegan to reckon on the Christmas holidays, when he should have five\nweeks at home, free from the evils of both places,--from lessons with\nMiss Harold, and from Crofton scrapes.\n\nIt is probable that the whole affair would have passed over quietly, and\nthe woman in the lane might have made large profits by other\ninexperienced boys, and Mr Carnaby might have gone on being careless as\nto where the boys went out of his sight on Saturdays, but that Tom Holt\nate too many plums on the present occasion.  On Sunday morning he was\nnot well; and was so ill by the evening, and all Monday, that he had to\nbe regularly nursed; and when he left his bed, he was taken to Mrs\nWatson's parlour,--the comfortable, quiet place where invalid boys\nenjoyed themselves.  Poor Holt was in very low spirits; and Mrs Watson\nwas so kind that he could not help telling her that he owed a shilling,\nand he did not know how he should ever pay it; and that Hugh Proctor,\nwho had been his friend till now, seemed on a sudden much more fond of\nDale; and this made it harder to be in debt to him.\n\nThe wet, smeared lining of the pockets had told Mrs Watson already that\nthere had been some improper indulgence in good things; and when she\nheard what part Lamb had played towards the little boys, she thought it\nright to tell Mr Tooke.  Mr Tooke said nothing till Holt was in the\nschool again, which was on Thursday; and not then till the little boys\nhad said their lessons, at past eleven o'clock.  They were drawing on\ntheir slates, and Lamb was still mumbling over his book, without getting\non, when the master's awful voice was heard, calling up before him Lamb,\nlittle Proctor, and Holt.  All three started, and turned red; so that\nthe school concluded them guilty before it was known what they were\ncharged with.  Dale knew,--and he alone; and very sorry he was, for the\nintimacy between Hugh and him had grown very close indeed since\nSaturday.\n\nThe master was considerate towards the younger boys.  He made Lamb tell\nthe whole.  Even when the cowardly lad \"bellowed\" (as his school-fellows\ncalled his usual mode of crying) so that nothing else could be heard,\nMr Tooke waited, rather than question the other two.  When the whole\nstory was extracted, in all its shamefulness, from Lamb's own lips, the\nmaster expressed his disgust.  He said nothing about the money part of\nit--about how Hugh was to be paid.  He probably thought it best for the\nboys to take the consequences of their folly in losing their money.  He\nhanded the little boys over to Mr Carnaby to be caned--\"To make them\nremember,\" as he said; though they themselves were pretty sure they\nshould never forget.  Lamb was kept to be punished by the master\nhimself.  Though Lamb knew he should be severely flogged, and though he\nwas the most cowardly boy in the school, he did not suffer so much as\nHugh did in the prospect of being caned--being punished at all.  Phil,\nwho knew his brother's face well, saw, as he passed down the room, how\nmiserable he was--too miserable to cry; and Phil pulled him by the\nsleeve, and whispered that being caned was nothing to mind--only a\nstroke or two across the shoulders.  Hugh shook his head, as much as to\nsay, \"It is not that.\"\n\nNo--it was not the pain.  It was the being punished in open school, and\nwhen he did not feel that he deserved it.  How should he know where Lamb\nwas taking him?  How should he know that the ginger-beer was to be paid\nfor, and that he was to pay?  He felt himself injured enough already:\nand now to be punished in addition!  He would have died on the spot for\nliberty to tell Mr Tooke and everybody what he thought of the way he\nwas treated.  He had felt his mother hard sometimes; but what had she\never done to him compared with this?  It was well he thought of his\nmother.  At the first moment, the picture of home in his mind nearly\nmade him cry--the thing of all others he most wished to avoid while so\nmany eyes were on him; but the remembrance of what his mother expected\nof him--her look when she told him _he must not fail_, gave him courage.\nHard as it was to be, as he believed, unjustly punished, it was better\nthan having done anything very wrong--anything that he really could not\nhave told his mother.\n\nMr Carnaby foresaw that a rebuke was in store for him for his\nnegligence during the walk on Saturday; and this anticipation did not\nsweeten his mood.  He kept the little boys waiting, though Holt was\ntrembling very much, and still weak from his illness.  It occurred to\nthe usher that another person might be made uncomfortable; and he\nimmediately acted on the idea.  He had observed how fond of one another\nDale and Hugh had become; and he thought he would plague Dale a little.\nHe therefore summoned him, and desired him to go, and bring him a\nswitch, to cane these boys with.\n\n\"I have broken my cane; so bring me a stout switch,\" said he.  \"Bring me\none out of the orchard; one that will lay on well--one that will not\nbreak with a good hard stroke;--mind what I say--one that will not\nbreak.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Dale, readily; and he went as if he was not at all\nunwilling.  Holt shivered.  Hugh never moved.\n\nIt was long, very long, before Dale returned.  When he did, he brought a\nremarkably stout broomstick.\n\n\"This won't break, I think, sir,\" said he.\n\nThe boys giggled.  Mr Carnaby knuckled Dale's head as he asked him if\nhe called that a switch.\n\n\"Bring me a _switch_\" said he.  \"One that is not too stout, or else it\nwill not sting.  It must sting, remember,--sting well.  Not too stout,\nremember.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Dale; and away he went again.\n\nHe was now gone yet longer; and by the time he returned everybody's eyes\nwere fixed on the door, to see what sort of a switch would next appear.\nDale entered, bringing a straw.\n\n\"I think this will not be too stout, sir.\"\n\nEverybody laughed but Hugh--even Holt.\n\nThere was that sneer about Mr Carnaby's nose which made everybody sorry\nnow for Dale: but everybody started, Mr Carnaby and all, at Mr Tooke's\nvoice, close at hand.  How much he had seen and heard, there was no\nknowing; but it was enough to make him look extremely stern.\n\n\"Are these boys not caned yet, Mr Carnaby?\"\n\n\"No, sir:--I have not--I--\"\n\n\"Have they been standing here all this while?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I have no cane, sir.  I have been sending--\"\n\n\"I ordered them an immediate caning, Mr Carnaby, and not mental\ntorture.  School is up,\" he declared to the boys at large.  \"You may\ngo--you have been punished enough,\" he said to the little boys.  \"Mr\nCarnaby, have the goodness to remain a moment.\"\n\nAnd the large room was speedily emptied of all but the master, the\nusher, and poor Lamb.\n\n\"The usher will catch it now,\" observed some boys, as the master himself\nshut the door behind them.  \"He will get well paid for his spite.\"\n\n\"What will be done to him?\" asked Hugh of Dale, whom he loved fervently\nfor having saved him from punishment.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know; and I don't care--though he was just going to give my\nhead some sound raps against the wall, if Mr Tooke had not come up at\nthe moment.\"\n\n\"But what _will_ be done to Mr Carnaby?\"\n\n\"Never mind what: he won't be here long, they say.  Fisher says there is\nanother coming; and Carnaby is here only till that other is at liberty.\"\n\nThis was good news, if true: and Hugh ran off, quite in spirits, to\nplay.  He had set himself diligently to learn to play, and would not be\ndriven off; and Dale had insisted on fair scope for him.  He played too\nwell to be objected to any more.  They now went to leap-frog; and when\ntoo hot to keep it up any longer, he and Dale mounted into the\napple-tree to talk, while they were cooling, and expecting the\ndinner-bell.\n\nSomething happened very wonderful before dinner.  The gardener went down\nto the main road, and seemed to be looking out.  At last he hailed the\nLondon coach.  Hugh and Dale could see from their perch.  The coach\nstopped, the gardener ran back, met Mr Carnaby under the chestnuts,\nrelieved him of his portmanteau, and helped him to mount the coach.\n\n\"Is he going?  Gone for good?\" passed from mouth to mouth, all over the\nplayground.\n\n\"Gone for good,\" was the answer of those who knew to a certainty.\n\nThe boys set up first a groan, so loud that perhaps the departing usher\nheard it.  Then they gave a shout of joy, in which the little boys\njoined with all their might--Hugh waving his cap in the apple-tree.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. WHAT IS ONLY TO BE HAD AT HOME.\n\nHugh got on far better with his lessons as he grew more intimate with\nDale.  It was not so much that Dale helped him with his grammar and\nconstruing (for Dale thought every boy should make shift to do his own\nbusiness) as that he liked to talk about his work, even with a younger\nboy; and so, as he said, clear his head.  A great deal that he said was\nabove Hugh's comprehension; and much of his repetitions mere words: but\nthere were other matters which fixed Hugh's attention, and proved to him\nthat study might be interesting out of school.  When Dale had a theme to\nwrite, the two boys often walked up and down the playground for half an\nhour together, talking the subject over, and telling of anything they\nhad heard or read upon it.  Hugh presently learned the names and the\nmeanings of the different parts of a theme; and he could sometimes help\nwith an illustration or example, though he left it to his friend to lay\ndown the Proposition, and search out the Confirmation.  Dale's\nnonsense-verses were perfect nonsense to Hugh: but his construing was\nnot: and when he went over it aloud, for the purpose of fixing his\nlesson in his ear, as well as his mind, Hugh was sorry when they arrived\nat the end, and eager to know what came next,--particularly if they had\nto stop in the middle of a story of Ovid's.  Every week, almost every\nday now, made a great difference in Hugh's school-life.  He still found\nhis lessons very hard work, and was often in great fear and pain about\nthem,--but he continually perceived new light breaking in upon his mind:\nhis memory served him better; the little he had learned came when he\nwanted it, instead of just a minute too late.  He rose in the morning\nwith less anxiety about the day: and when playing, could forget school.\n\nThere was no usher yet in Mr Carnaby's place; and all the boys said\ntheir lessons to Mr Tooke himself: which Hugh liked very much, when he\nhad got over the first fear.  A writing-master came from a distance\ntwice a week, when the whole school was at writing and arithmetic all\nthe afternoon: but every other lesson was said to the master; and this\nwas likely to go on till Christmas, as the new usher, of whom, it was\nsaid, Mr Tooke thought so highly as to choose to wait for him, could\nnot come before that time.  Of course, with so much upon his hands, Mr\nTooke had not a moment to spare; and slow or idle boys were sent back to\ntheir desks at the first trip or hesitation in their lessons.  Hugh was\nafraid, at the outset, that he should be like poor Lamb, who never got a\nwhole lesson said during these weeks: and he was turned down sometimes;\nbut not often enough to depress him.  He learned to trust more to his\near and his memory: his mind became excited, as in playing a game: and\nhe found he got through, he scarcely knew how.  His feeling of fatigue\nafterwards proved to him that this was harder work than he had ever done\nat home; but he did not feel it so at the time.  When he could learn a\nlesson in ten minutes, and say it in one; when he began to use Latin\nphrases in his private thoughts, and saw the meaning of a rule of\nsyntax, so as to be able to find a fresh example out of his own head, he\nfelt himself really a Crofton boy, and his heart grew light within him.\n\nThe class to which Hugh belonged was one day standing waiting to be\nheard, when the master was giving a subject and directions for an\nEnglish theme to Dale's class.  The subject was the Pleasures of\nFriendship.  In a moment Hugh thought of Damon and Pythias, and of David\nand Jonathan,--of the last of whom there was a picture in Mrs Watson's\ngreat Bible.  He thought how happy he had been since he had known Dale,\nand his heart was in such a glow, he was sure he could write a theme.\nHe ran after Mr Tooke when school was over, and asked whether he might\nwrite a theme with Dale's class.  When Mr Tooke found he knew what was\nmeant by writing a theme, he said he might try, if he neglected nothing\nfor it, and wrote every word of it himself, without consultation with\nany one.\n\nHugh scampered away to tell Dale that they must not talk over this theme\ntogether, as they were both to do it; and then, instead of playing, he\nwent to his desk, and wrote upon his slate till it was quite full.  He\nhad to borrow two slates before he had written all he had to say.  Phil\nruled his paper for him; but before he had copied one page, his\nneighbours wanted their slates back again,--said they must have them,\nand rubbed out all he had written.  Much of the little time he had was\nlost in this way, and he grew wearied.  He thought at first that his\ntheme would be very beautiful: but he now began to doubt whether it\nwould be worth anything at all; and he was vexed to have tired himself\nwith doing what would only make him laughed at.  The first page was well\nwritten out,--the Confirmation being properly separated from the\nProposition: but he had to write all the latter part directly from his\nhead upon the paper, as the slates were taken away; and he forgot to\nseparate the Conclusion from the Inference.\n\nHe borrowed a penknife, and tried to scratch out half a line; but he\nonly made a hole in the paper, and was obliged to let the line stand.\nThen he found he had strangely forgotten to put in the chief thing of\nall,--about friends telling one another of their faults,--though, on\nconsideration, he was not sure that this was one of the Pleasures of\nFriendship: so, perhaps, it did not much matter.  But there were two\nblots; and he had left out Jonathan's name, which had to be interlined.\nAltogether, it had the appearance of a very bad theme.  Firth came and\nlooked over his shoulder, as he was gazing at it; and Firth offered to\nwrite it out for him; and even thought it would be fair, as he had had\nnothing to do with the composition: but Hugh could not think it would be\nfair, and said, sighing, that his must take its chance.  He did not\nthink he could have done a theme so very badly.\n\nMr Tooke beckoned him up with Dale's class, when they carried up their\nthemes; and, seeing how red his face was, the master bade him not be\nafraid.  But how could he help being afraid?  The themes were not read\ndirectly.  It was Mr Tooke's practice to read them out of school-hours.\nOn this occasion, judgment was given the last thing before school broke\nup the next morning.\n\nHugh had never been more astonished in his life.  Mr Tooke praised his\ntheme very much, and said it had surprised him.  He did not mind the\nblots and mistakes, which would, he said, have been great faults in a\ncopy-book, but were of less consequence than other things in a theme.\nTime and pains would correct slovenliness of that kind; and the thoughts\nand language were good.  Hugh was almost out of his wits with delight;\nso nearly so that he spoiled his own pleasure completely.  He could not\nkeep his happiness to himself, or his vanity: for Hugh had a good deal\nof vanity,--more than he was aware of before this day.  He told several\nboys what Mr Tooke had said: but he soon found that would not do.  Some\nwere indifferent, but most laughed at him.  Then he ran to Mrs Watson's\nparlour, and knocked.  Nobody answered; for the room was empty: so Hugh\nsought her in various places, and at last found her in the kitchen,\nboiling some preserves.\n\n\"What do you come here for?  This is no place for you,\" said she, when\nthe maids tried in vain to put Hugh out.\n\n\"I only want to tell you one thing,\" cried Hugh; and he repeated exactly\nwhat Mr Tooke had said of his theme.  Mrs Watson laughed, and the\nmaids laughed, and Hugh left them, angry with them, but more angry with\nhimself.  They did not care for him,--nobody cared for him, he said to\nhimself; he longed for his mother's look or approbation when he had done\nwell, and Agnes' pleasure, and even Susan's fondness and praise.  He\nsought Dale.  Dale was in the midst of a game, and had not a word or\nlook to spare till it was over.  The boys would have admitted Hugh; for\nhe could now play as well as anybody; but he was in no mood for play\nnow.  He climbed his tree, and sat there, stinging his mind with the\nthought of his having carried his boastings into the kitchen, and with\nhis recollection of Mrs Watson's laugh.\n\nIt often happened that Firth and Hugh met at this tree; and it happened\nnow.  There was room for both; and Firth mounted, and read for some\ntime.  At last he seemed to be struck by Hugh's restlessness and heavy\nsighs; and he asked whether he had not got something to amuse himself\nwith.\n\n\"No.  I don't want to amuse myself,\" said Hugh, stretching so as almost\nto throw himself out of the tree.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?  Did you not come off well with your theme?  I\nheard somebody say you were quite enough set up about it.\"\n\n\"Where is the use of doing a thing well, if nobody cares about it?\" said\nHugh.  \"I don't believe anybody at Crofton cares a bit about me--cares\nwhether I get on well or ill--except Dale.  If I take pains and succeed,\nthey only laugh at me.\"\n\n\"Ah!  You don't understand school and schoolboys yet,\" replied Firth.\n\"To do a difficult lesson well is a grand affair at home, and the whole\nhouse knows of it.  But it is the commonest thing in the world here.  If\nyou learn to feel with these boys, instead of expecting them to feel\nwith you (which they cannot possibly do), you will soon find that they\ncare for you accordingly.\"\n\nHugh shook his head.\n\n\"You will find it in every school in England,\" continued Firth, \"that it\nis not the way of boys to talk about feelings--about anybody's feelings.\nThat is the reason why they do not mention their sisters or their\nmothers--except when two confidential friends are together, in a tree,\nor by themselves in the meadows.  But, as sure as ever a boy is full of\naction--if he tops the rest at play--holds his tongue, or helps others\ngenerously--or shows a manly spirit without being proud of it, the whole\nschool is his friend.  You have done well, so far, by growing more and\nmore sociable; but you will lose ground if you boast about your lessons\nout of school.  To prosper at Crofton, you must put off home, and make\nyourself a Crofton boy.\"\n\n\"I don't care about that,\" said Hugh.  \"I give it all up.  There is\nnothing but injustice here.\"\n\n\"Nothing but injustice!  Pray, am I unjust?\"\n\n\"No--not you--not so far.  But--\"\n\n\"Is Mr Tooke unjust?\"\n\n\"Yes--very.\"\n\n\"Pray how, and when?\"\n\n\"He has been so unjust to me, that if it had not been for something, I\ncould not have borne it.  I am not going to tell you what that something\nis: only you need not be afraid but that I can bear everything.  If the\nwhole world was against me--\"\n\n\"Well, never mind what that something is; but tell me how Mr Tooke is\nunjust to you.\"\n\n\"He punished me when I did not deserve it; and he praised me when I did\nnot deserve it.  I was cheated and injured that Saturday; and, instead\nof seeing me righted, Mr Tooke ordered me to be punished.  And to-day,\nwhen my theme was so badly done that I made sure of being blamed, he\npraised me.\"\n\n\"This might be injustice at home,\" replied Firth, \"because parents know,\nor ought to know, all that is in their children's minds, and exactly\nwhat their children can do.  A schoolmaster can judge only by what he\nsees.  Mr Tooke does not know yet that you could have done your theme\nbetter than you did--as your mother would have known.  When he finds you\ncan do better, he will not praise such a theme again.  Meantime, how you\ncan boast of his praise, if you think it unjust, is the wonder to me.\"\n\n\"So it is to me now.  I wish I had never asked to do that theme at all,\"\ncried Hugh, again stretching himself to get rid of his shame.  \"But why\ndid Mr Tooke order me to be caned?  Why did he not make Lamb and Holt\npay me what they owe?  I was injured before: and he injured me more.\"\n\n\"You were to be caned because you left the heath and entered a house\nwithout leave--not because you had been cheated of your money.\"\n\n\"But I did not know where I was going.  I never meant to enter a house.\"\n\n\"But you did both; and what you suffered will prevent your letting\nyourself be led into such a scrape again.  As for the money part of the\nmatter--a school is to boys what the world is when they become men.\nThey must manage their own affairs among themselves.  The difference is,\nthat here is the master to be applied to, if we choose.  He will advise\nyou about your money, if you choose to ask him: but, for my part, I\nwould rather put up with the loss, if I were you.\"\n\n\"Nobody will ever understand what I mean about justice,\" muttered Hugh.\n\n\"Suppose,\" said Firth, \"while you are complaining of injustice in this\nway, somebody else should be complaining in the same way of your\ninjustice.\"\n\n\"Nobody can--fairly,\" replied Hugh.\n\n\"Do you see that poor fellow, skulking there under the orchard-wall?\"\n\n\"What, Holt?\"\n\n\"Yes, Holt.  I fancy the thought in his mind at this moment is that you\nare the most unjust person at Crofton.\"\n\n\"I!  Unjust!\"\n\n\"Yes; so he thinks.  When you first came, you and he were companions.\nYou found comfort in each other while all the rest were strangers to\nyou.  You were glad to hear, by the hour together, what he had to tell\nyou about India, and his voyages and travels.  Now he feels himself\nlonely and forsaken, while he sees you happy with a friend.  He thinks\nit hard that you should desert him because he owes you a shilling, when\nhe was cheated quite as much as you.\"\n\n\"Because he owes me a shilling!\" cried Hugh, starting to his feet, \"as\nif--\"\n\nOnce more he had nearly fallen from his perch.  Firth caught him; and\nthen asked him how Holt should think otherwise than as he did, since\nHugh had been his constant companion up to that Saturday afternoon, and\nhad hardly spoken to him since.\n\nHugh protested that the shilling had nothing to do with the matter; and\nhe never meant to take more than sixpence from Holt, because he thought\nLamb was the one who ought to pay the shilling.  The thing was, he did\nnot, and could not, like Holt half so well as Dale.  He could not make a\nfriend of Holt, because he wanted spirit--he had no courage.  What could\nhe do?  He could not pretend to be intimate with Holt when he did not\nlike him; and if he explained that the shilling had nothing to do with\nthe matter, he could not explain how it really was, when the fault was\nin the boy's character, and not in his having given any particular\noffence.  What could he do?\n\nFirth thought he could only learn not to expect, anywhere out of the\nbounds of home, what he thought justice.  He must, of course, try\nhimself to be just to everybody; but he must make up his mind in school,\nas men have to do in the world, to be misunderstood--to be wrongly\nvalued; to be blamed when he felt himself the injured one; and praised\nwhen he knew he did not deserve it.\n\n\"But it is so hard,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"And what do people leave home for but to learn hard lessons?\"\n\n\"But still, if it were not for--\"\n\n\"For what?  Do you see any comfort under it?\" asked Firth, fixing his\neyes on Hugh.\n\nHugh nodded, without speaking.\n\n\"That One understands us who cannot be unjust!\" whispered Firth.  \"I am\nglad you feel that.\"\n\n\"Even home would be bad enough without that,\" said Hugh.  \"And what\nwould school be?\"\n\n\"Or the world?\" added Frith.  \"But do not get cross, and complain again.\nLeave that to those who have no comfort.\"\n\nHugh nodded again.  Then he got down, and ran to tell Holt that he did\nnot want a shilling from him, because he thought sixpence would be\nfairer.\n\nHolt was glad to hear this at first; but he presently said that it did\nnot much matter, for that he had no more chance of being able to pay\nsixpence than a shilling.  His parents were in India, and his uncle\nnever offered him any money.  He knew indeed that his uncle had none to\nspare; for he had said in the boy's hearing, that it was hard on him to\nhave to pay the school-bills (unless he might pay them in the produce of\nhis farm), so long as it must be before he could be repaid from India.\nSo Holt did not dare to ask for pocket-money; and for the hundredth time\nhe sighed over his debt.  He had almost left off hoping that Hugh, would\nexcuse him altogether, though everybody knew that Hugh had five\nshillings in Mrs Watson's hands.  This fact and Hugh's frequent\napplications to Lamb for payment, had caused an impression that Hugh was\nfond of money.  It was not so; and yet the charge was not unfair.  Hugh\nwas ready to give if properly asked; but he did not relish, and could\nnot bear with temper, the injustice of such a forced borrowing as had\nstripped him of his half-crown.  He wanted his five shillings for\npresents for his family; and for these reasons, and not because he was\nmiserly, he did not offer to excuse Holt's debt; which it would have\nbeen more generous to have done.  Nobody could wish that he should\nexcuse Lamb's.\n\n\"When are you going to your uncle's?\" asked Holt.  \"I suppose you _are_\ngoing some day before Christmas.\"\n\n\"On Saturday, to stay till Sunday night,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"And Proctor goes too, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes; of course, Phil goes too.\"\n\n\"Anybody else?\"\n\n\"We are each to take one friend, just for Saturday, to come home at\nnight.\"\n\n\"Oh?  Then, you will take me.  You said you would.\"\n\n\"Did I?  That must have been a long time ago.\"\n\n\"But you did say so,--that, whenever you went, you would ask leave to\ntake me.\"\n\n\"I don't remember any such thing.  And I am going to take Dale this\ntime.  I have promised him.\"\n\nHolt cried with vexation.  Dale was always in his way.  Hugh cared for\nnobody but Dale; but Dale should not go to Mr Shaw's till he had had\nhis turn.  He had been promised first, and he would go first.  He would\nspeak to Mrs Watson, and get leave to go and tell Mrs Shaw, and then\nhe was sure Mr Shaw would let him go.\n\nHugh was very uncomfortable.  He really could not remember having made\nthis promise: but he could not be sure that he had not.  He asked Holt\nif he thought he should like to be in people's way, to spoil the holiday\nby going where he was not wished for; but this sort of remonstrance did\nnot comfort Holt at all.  Hugh offered that he should have the very next\nturn, if he would give up now.\n\n\"I dare say!  And when will that be?  You know on Sunday it will want\nonly nineteen days to the holidays; and you will not be going to your\nuncle's again this half-year.  A pretty way of putting me off!\"\n\nThen, as if a sudden thought had struck him, he cried,--\n\n\"But Proctor has to take somebody.\"\n\n\"Yes; Phil takes Tooke.  They settled that a week ago.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Can't you ask him to take me?\"\n\n\"No; I shall not meddle with Phil.  Besides, I am glad he has chosen\nTooke.  Tooke behaved well to me about the sponge that day.  Tooke has\nsome spirit.\"\n\nThis put Holt in mind of the worst of his adventures since he came to\nCrofton, and of all the miseries of being shunned as a tell-tale.  He\ncried so bitterly as to touch Hugh's heart.  As if thinking aloud, Hugh\ntold him that he seemed very forlorn, and that he wished he would find a\nfriend to be intimate with.  This would make him so much happier as he\nhad no idea of; as he himself had found since he had had Dale for a\nfriend.\n\nThis naturally brought out a torrent of reproaches, which was followed\nby a hot argument; Holt insisting that Hugh ought to have been his\nintimate friend; and Hugh asking how he could make a friend of a boy who\nwanted spirit.  They broke away from one another at last, Hugh declaring\nHolt to be unreasonable and selfish, and Holt thinking Hugh cruel and\ninsulting.\n\nOf course Mrs Watson would not hear of Holt's going to Mr Shaw, to ask\nfor an invitation for Saturday.  He was told he must wait till another\ntime.  It was no great consolation to Holt that on Sunday it would want\nonly nineteen days to the holidays: for he was to remain at Crofton.  He\nhoped to like the holidays better than school-days, and to be petted by\nMrs Watson, and to sit by the fire, instead of being forced into the\nplayground in all weathers; but still he could not look forward to\nChristmas with the glee which other boys felt.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. A LONG DAY.\n\nHugh, meantime, was counting the hours till Saturday.  Perhaps, if the\ntruth were known, so was Phil, though he was too old to acknowledge such\na longing.  But the climbing about the mill,--the play encouraged there\nby his uncle and the men,--his uncle's stories within doors, his aunt's\ngood dinners,--the fire-side, the picture-books, the talk of home,\naltogether made up the greatest treat of the half-year.  Phil had plenty\nof ways of passing the time.  Hugh began a long letter home,--the very\nlast letter, except the short formal one which should declare when the\nChristmas vacation should commence.  Hugh meant to write half the letter\nbefore Saturday, and then fill it up with an account of his visit to his\nuncle's.\n\nThe days were passed, however, when Hugh had the command of his leisure\ntime, as on his arrival, when his hours were apt to hang heavy.  He had\nlong since become too valuable in the playground to be left to follow\nhis own devices.  As the youngest boy, he was looked upon as a sort of\nservant to the rest, when once it was found that he was quick and\nclever.  Either as scout, messenger, or in some such capacity, he was\ncontinually wanted; and often at times inconvenient to himself.  He then\nusually remembered what Mr Tooke had told him of his boy, when Tooke\nwas the youngest,--how he bore things--not only being put on the high\nwall, but being well worked in the service of the older boys.  Usually\nHugh was obliging, but he could and did feel cross at times.  He was\ncross on this Friday,--the day when he was so anxious to write his\nletter before going to his uncle's.  On Saturday there would be no time.\nThe early mornings were dark now; and after school he should have to\nwash and dress, and be off to his uncle's.  On Friday then, his paper\nwas ruled, and he had only to run across the playground to borrow\nFirth's penknife, and then nothing should delay his letter.\n\nIn that ran across the playground he was stopped.  He was wanted to\ncollect clean snow for the boys who were bent on finishing their\nsnow-man while it would bind.  He should be let off when he had brought\nsnow enough.  But he knew that by that time his fingers would be too\nstiff to hold his pen; and he said he did not choose to stop now.  Upon\nthis Lamb launched a snowball in his face.  Hugh grew angry,--or, as his\nschoolfellows said, insolent.  Some stood between him and the house, to\nprevent his getting home, while others promised to roll him in the snow\ntill he yielded full submission.  Instead of yielding, Hugh made for the\norchard-wall, scrambled up it, and stood for the moment out of the reach\nof his enemies.  He kicked down such a quantity of snow upon any one who\ncame near, that he held all at bay for some little time.  At last,\nhowever, he had disposed of all the snow within his reach, and they were\npelting him thickly with snow-balls.  It was not at any time very easy\nto stand upright, for long together, upon this wall, as the stones which\ncapped it were rounded.  Now, when the coping-stones were slippery after\nthe frost, and Hugh nearly blinded with the shower of snow-balls, he\ncould not keep his footing, and was obliged to sit astride upon the\nwall.  This brought one foot within reach from below; and though Hugh\nkicked, and drew up his foot as far and as often as he could, so as not\nto lose his balance, it was snatched at by many hands.  At last, one\nhand kept its hold, and plenty more then fastened upon his leg.  They\npulled: he clung.  In another moment, down he came, and the large, heavy\ncoping-stone, loosened by the frost, came after him, and fell upon his\nleft foot as he lay.\n\nIt was a dreadful shriek that he gave.  Mrs Watson heard it in her\nstore-room, and Mr Tooke in his study.  Some labourers felling a tree\nin a wood, a quarter of a mile off, heard it, and came running to see\nwhat could be the matter.  The whole school was in a cluster round the\npoor boy in a few seconds.  During this time, while several were engaged\nin lifting away the stone, Tooke stooped over him, and said, with his\nlips as white as paper,--\n\n\"Who was it that pulled you,--that got the first hold of you?  Was it I?\nO!  Say it was not I.\"\n\n\"It was you,\" said Hugh.  \"But never mind!  You did not mean it.\"--He\nsaw that Tooke's pain was worse than his own, and he added, in a faint\nwhisper,--\n\n\"Don't you tell, and then nobody will know.  Mind you don't!\"\n\nOne boy after another turned away from the sight of his foot, when the\nstone was removed.  Tooke fainted, but, then, so did another boy who had\nnothing to do with the matter.  Everybody who came up asked who did it;\nand nobody could answer.  Tooke did not hear; and so many felt\nthemselves concerned, that no one wished that any answer should be\ngiven.\n\n\"Who did it, my dear boy?\" asked Firth, bending over him.\n\n\"Never mind!\" was all Hugh could say.  He groaned in terrible pain.\n\nHe must not lie there; but who could touch him?  Firth did; and he was\nthe right person, as he was one of the strongest.  He made two boys pass\ntheir handkerchiefs under the leg, and sling it, without touching it;\nand he lifted Hugh, and carried him across his arms towards the house.\nThey met Mr Tooke, and every person belonging to the household, before\nthey reached the door.\n\n\"To my bed!\" said the master, when he saw: and in an instant the\ngardener had his orders to saddle Mr Tooke's horse, and ride to London\nfor an eminent surgeon: stopping by the way to beg Mr and Mrs Shaw to\ncome, and bring with them the surgeon who was their neighbour, Mr\nAnnanby.\n\n\"Who did it?\"\n\n\"Who pulled him down?\" passed from mouth to mouth of the household.\n\n\"He won't tell,--noble fellow,\" cried Firth.  \"Don't ask him.  Never ask\nhim who pulled him down.\"\n\n\"You will never repent it, my dear boy,\" whispered Firth.  Hugh tried to\nsmile, but he could not help groaning again.  There was a suppressed\ngroan from some one else.  It was from Mr Tooke.  Hugh was sadly afraid\nhe had, by some means, found out who did the mischief.  But it was not\nso.  Mr Tooke was quite wretched enough without that.\n\nEverybody was very kind, and did the best that could be done.  Hugh was\nheld up on the side of Mr Tooke's bed, while Mrs Watson took off his\nclothes, cutting the left side of his trousers to pieces, without any\nhesitation.  The master held the leg firmly while the undressing went\non; and then poor Hugh was laid back, and covered up warm, while the\nfoot was placed on a pillow, with only a light handkerchief thrown over\nit.\n\nIt was terrible to witness his pain; but Mr Tooke never left him all\nday.  He chafed his hands, he gave him drink; he told him he had no\ndoubt his mother would arrive soon; he encouraged him to say or do\nanything that he thought would give him ease.\n\n\"Cry, my dear,\" he said, \"if you want to cry.  Do not hide tears from\nme.\"\n\n\"I can't help crying,\" sobbed Hugh: \"but it is not the pain,--not only\nthe pain; it is because you are so kind!\"\n\n\"Where _is_ Phil?\" he said at last.\n\n\"He is so very unhappy, that we think he had better not see you till\nthis pain is over.  When you are asleep, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Oh!  When will that be?\" and poor Hugh rolled his head on the pillow.\n\n\"George rides fast; he is far on his way by this time,\" said Mr Tooke.\n\"And one or other of the surgeons will soon be here; and they will tell\nus what to do, and what to expect.\"\n\n\"Do tell Phil so,--will you?\"\n\nMr Tooke rang the bell; and the message was sent to Phil, with Hugh's\nlove.\n\n\"Will the surgeon hurt me much, do you think?\"  Hugh asked.  \"I will\nbear it.  I only want to know.\"\n\n\"I should think you hardly could be in more pain than you are now,\"\nreplied Mr Tooke.  \"I trust they will relieve you of this pain.  I\nshould not wonder if you are asleep to-night as quietly as any of us;\nand then you will not mind what they may have done to you.\"\n\nHugh thought he should mind nothing, if he could ever be asleep again.\n\nHe was soon asked if he would like to see his uncle and aunt, who were\ncome.  He wished to see his uncle; and Mr Shaw came up, with the\nsurgeon.  Mr Annanby did scarcely anything to the foot at present.  He\nsoon covered it up again, and said he would return in time to meet the\nsurgeon who was expected from London.  Then Hugh and his uncle were\nalone.\n\nMr Shaw told him how sorry the boys all were, and how they had come in\nfrom the playground at once, and put themselves under Firth, to be kept\nquiet; and that very little dinner had been eaten; and that, when the\nwriting-master arrived, he was quite astonished to find everything so\nstill, and the boys so spiritless: but that nobody told him till he\nobserved how two or three were crying, so that he was sure something was\nthe matter.\n\n\"Which?  Who?  Who is crying?\" asked Hugh.\n\n\"Poor Phil, and I do not know who else,--not being acquainted with the\nrest.\"\n\n\"How glad I am that Dale had nothing to do with it!\" said Hugh.  \"He was\nquite on the other side of the playground.\"\n\n\"They tell me below that I must not ask you how it happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!  You may.  Everything except just who it was that pulled me\ndown.  So many got hold of me that nobody knows exactly who gave _the_\npull, except myself and one other.  He did not mean it; and I was cross\nabout playing with them; and the stone on the wall was loose or it would\nnot have happened.  O dear!  O dear!  Uncle, do you think it a bad\naccident?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, a very bad accident.\"\n\n\"Do you think I shall die?  I never thought of that,\" said Hugh.  And he\nraised himself a little, but was obliged to lie back again.\n\n\"No; I do not think you will die.\"\n\n\"Will they think so at home?  Was that the reason they were sent to?\"\n\n\"No: I have no doubt your mother will come to nurse you, and to comfort\nyou: but--\"\n\n\"To comfort me?  Why, Mr Tooke said the pain would soon be over, he\nthought, and I should be asleep to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes; but though the pain may be over, it may leave you lame.  That will\nbe a misfortune; and you will be glad of your mother to comfort you.\"\n\n\"Lame!\" said the boy.  Then, as he looked wistfully in his uncle's face,\nhe saw the truth.\n\n\"Oh!  Uncle, they are going to cut off my leg.\"\n\n\"Not your leg, I hope, Hugh.  You will not be quite so lame as that: but\nI am afraid you must lose your foot.\"\n\n\"Was that what Mr Tooke meant by the surgeon's relieving me of my\npain?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was.\"\n\n\"Then it will be before night.  Is it quite certain, uncle?\"\n\n\"Mr Annanby thinks so.  Your foot is too much hurt ever to be cured.\nDo you think you can bear it, Hugh?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I suppose so.  So many people have.  It is less than some of\nthe savages bear.  What horrid things they do to their captives,--and\neven to some of their own boys!  And they bear it.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you are not a savage.\"\n\n\"But one may be as brave, without being a savage.  Think of the martyrs\nthat were burnt, and some that were worse than burnt!  And they bore\nit.\"\n\nMr Shaw perceived that Hugh was either in much less pain now, or that\nhe forgot everything in a subject which always interested him extremely.\nHe told his uncle what he had read of the tortures inflicted by\nsavages, till his uncle, already a good deal agitated, was quite sick:\nbut he let him go on, hoping that the boy might think lightly in\ncomparison of what he himself had to undergo.  This could not last long,\nhowever.  The wringing pain soon came back; and as Hugh cried, he said\nhe bore it so very badly, he did not know what his mother would say if\nshe saw him.  She had trusted him not to fail; but really he could not\nbear this much longer.\n\nHis uncle told him that nobody had thought of his having such pain as\nthis to bear: that he had often shown himself a brave little fellow; and\nhe did not doubt that, when this terrible day was over, he would keep up\nhis spirits through all the rest.\n\nHugh would have his uncle go down to tea.  Then he saw a gown and shawl\nthrough the curtain, and started up; but it was not his mother yet.  It\nwas only Mrs Watson come to sit with him while his uncle had his tea.\n\nTea was over, and the younger boys had all gone up to bed, and the older\nones were just going when there was a ring at the gate.  It was Mrs\nProctor; and with her the surgeon from London.\n\n\"Mother!  Never mind, mother!\"  Hugh was beginning to say; but he\nstopped when he saw her face,--it was so very pale and grave.  At least,\nhe thought so; but he saw her only by fire-light; for the candle had\nbeen shaded from his eyes, because he could not bear it.  She kissed him\nwith a long, long kiss; but she did not speak.\n\n\"I wish the surgeon had come first,\" he whispered, \"and then they would\nhave had my foot off before you came.  When _will_ he come?\"\n\n\"He is here,--they are both here.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, do make them make haste.  Mr Tooke says I shall go to sleep\nafterwards.  You think so?  Then we will both go to sleep, and have our\ntalk in the morning.  Do not stay now,--this pain is _so_ bad,--I can't\nbear it well at all.  Do go, now, and bid them make haste, will you?\"\n\nHis mother whispered that she heard he had been a brave boy, and she\nknew he would be so still.  Then the surgeons came up, and Mr Shaw.\nThere was some bustle in the room, and Mr Shaw took his sister\ndown-stairs, and came up again, with Mr Tooke.\n\n\"Don't let mother come,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"No, my boy, I will stay with you,\" said his uncle.\n\nThe surgeons took off his foot.  As he sat in a chair, and his uncle\nstood behind him, and held his hands, and pressed his head against him,\nHugh felt how his uncle's breast was heaving,--and was sure he was\ncrying.  In the very middle of it all, Hugh looked up in his uncle's\nface, and said,--\n\n\"Never mind, uncle!  I can bear it.\"\n\nHe did bear it finely.  It was far more terrible than he had fancied;\nand he felt that he could not have gone on a minute longer.  When it was\nover, he muttered something, and Mr Tooke bent down to hear what it\nwas.  It was--\n\n\"I can't think how the Red Indians bear things so.\"\n\nHis uncle lifted him gently into bed, and told him that he would soon\nfeel easy now.\n\n\"Have you told mother?\" asked Hugh.\n\n\"Yes; we sent to her directly.\"\n\n\"How long did it take?\" asked Hugh.\n\n\"You have been out of bed only a few minutes--seven or eight, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle, you don't mean really?\"\n\n\"Really: but we know they seemed like hours to you.  Now, your mother\nwill bring you some tea.  When you have had that, you will go to sleep:\nso I shall wish you good-night now.\"\n\n\"When will you come again?\"\n\n\"Very often, till you come to me.  Not a word more now.  Good-night.\"\n\nHugh was half asleep when his tea came up, and quite so directly after\nhe had drunk it.  Though he slept a great deal in the course of the\nnight, he woke often,--such odd feelings disturbed him!  Every time he\nopened his eyes, he saw his mother sitting by the fire-side; and every\ntime he moved in the least, she came softly to look.  She would not let\nhim talk at all till near morning, when she found that he could not\nsleep any more, and that he seemed a little confused about where he\nwas,--what room it was, and how she came to be there by fire-light.\nThen she lighted a candle, and allowed him to talk about his friend\nDale, and several school affairs; and this brought back gradually the\nrecollection of all that had happened.\n\n\"I don't know what I have been about, I declare,\" said he, half\nlaughing.  But he was soon as serious as ever he was in his life, as he\nsaid, \"But oh!  Mother, tell me,--do tell me if I have let out who\npulled me off the wall.\"\n\n\"You have not,--you have not indeed,\" replied she.  \"I shall never ask.\nI do not wish to know.  I am glad you have not told; for it would do no\ngood.  It was altogether an accident.\"\n\n\"So it was,\" said Hugh; \"and it would make the boy so unhappy to be\npointed at!  Do promise me, if I should let it out in my sleep, that you\nwill never, never tell anybody.\"\n\n\"I promise you.  And I shall be the only person beside you while you are\nasleep, till you get well.  So you need not be afraid.--Now, lie still\nagain.\"\n\nShe put out the light, and he did lie still for some time; but then he\nwas struck with a sudden thought which made him cry out.\n\n\"O, mother, if I am so lame, I can never be a soldier or a sailor.--I\ncan never go round the world!\"\n\nAnd Hugh burst into tears, now more really afflicted than he had been\nyet.  His mother sat on the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as\nthey flowed, while he told her, as well as his sobs would let him, how\nlong and how much he had reckoned on going round the world, and how\nlittle he cared for anything else in the future; and now this was just\nthe very thing he should never be able to do!  He had practised climbing\never since he could remember;--and now that was of no use;--he had\npractised marching, and now he should never march again.  When he had\nfinished his complaint, there was a pause, and his mother said--\n\n\"Hugh, do you remember Richard Grant?\"\n\n\"What,--the cabinet-maker?  The man who carved so beautifully?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Do you remember--No, you could hardly have known: but I will tell\nyou.  He had planned a most beautiful set of carvings in wood for a\nchapel belonging to a nobleman's mansion.  He was to be well paid,--his\nwork was so superior; and he would be able to make his parents\ncomfortable, as well as his wife and children.  But the thing he most\ncared for was the honour of producing a noble work which would outlive\nhim.  Well, at the very beginning of his task, his chisel flew up\nagainst his wrist: and the narrow cut that it made,--not more than half\nan inch wide,--made his right-hand entirely useless for life.  He could\nnever again hold a tool;--his work was gone,--his business in life\nseemed over,--the support of the whole family was taken away--and the\nonly strong wish Richard Grant had in the world was disappointed.\"\n\nHugh hid his face with his handkerchief, and his mother went on:\n\n\"You have heard of Huber.\"\n\n\"The man who found out so much about bees.  Miss Harold read that\naccount to us.\"\n\n\"Bees and ants.  When Huber had discovered more than had ever been known\nbefore about bees and ants, and when he was sure he could learn more\nstill, and was more and more anxious to peep and pry into their tiny\nhomes, and their curious ways, Huber became blind.\"\n\nHugh sighed, and his mother went on:\n\n\"Did you ever hear of Beethoven?  He was one of the greatest musical\ncomposers that ever lived.  His great, his sole delight was in music.\nIt was the passion of his life.  When all his time and all his mind were\ngiven to music, he became deaf--perfectly deaf; so that he never more\nheard one single note from the loudest orchestra.  While crowds were\nmoved and delighted with his compositions, it was all silence to him.\"\n\nHugh said nothing.\n\n\"Now, do you think,\" asked his mother,--and Hugh saw by the grey light\nthat began to shine in, that she smiled--\"do you think that these people\nwere without a heavenly Parent?\"\n\n\"O no!  But were they all patient?\"\n\n\"Yes, in their different ways and degrees.  Would you say that they were\nhardly treated?  Or would you rather suppose that their Father gave them\nsomething more and better to do than they had planned for themselves?\"\n\n\"He must know best, of course: but it does seem hard that that very\nthing should happen to them.  Huber would not have so much minded being\ndeaf, perhaps; or that musical man being blind; or Richard Grant losing\nhis foot, instead of his hand: for he did not want to go round the\nworld.\"\n\n\"No doubt their hearts often swelled within them at their\ndisappointments: but I fully believe that they found very soon that\nGod's will was wiser than their wishes.  They found, if they bore their\ntrial well, that there was work for their hearts to do, far nobler than\nany work that the head can do through the eye, and the ear, and the\nhand.  And they soon felt a new and delicious pleasure, which none but\nthe bitterly disappointed can feel.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The pleasure of rousing their souls to bear pain, and of agreeing with\nGod silently, when nobody knows what is in their hearts.  There is a\ngreat pleasure in the exercise of the body,--in making the heart beat,\nand the limbs glow, in a run by the sea-side, or a game in the\nplayground; but this is nothing to the pleasure there is in exercising\none's soul in bearing pain,--in finding one's heart glow with the hope\nthat one is pleasing God.\"\n\n\"Shall I feel that pleasure?\"\n\n\"Often and often, I have no doubt,--every time that you can willingly\ngive up your wish to be a soldier or a sailor,--or anything else that\nyou have set your mind upon, if you can smile to yourself, and say that\nyou will be content at home.--Well, I don't expect it of you yet.  I\ndare say it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see hundreds of\npeople in raptures with his music, when he could not hear a note of it.\nAnd Huber--\"\n\n\"But did Beethoven get to smile?\"\n\n\"If he did, he was happier than all the fine music in the world could\nhave made him.\"\n\n\"I wonder--O!  I wonder if I ever shall feel so.\"\n\n\"We will pray to God that you may.  Shall we ask Him now?\"\n\nHugh clasped his hands.  His mother kneeled beside the bed, and, in a\nvery few words, prayed that Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune\nwell, and that his friends might give him such help and comfort as God\nshould approve.\n\n\"Now, my dear, you will sleep again,\" she said, as she arose.\n\n\"If you will lie down too, instead of sitting by the fire.  Do, mother.\"\n\nShe did so; and they were soon both asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. CROFTON QUIET.\n\nThe boys were all in the school-room in the grey of the morning;--no one\nlate.  Mr Tooke was already there.  Almost every boy looked wistfully\nin the grave face of the master;--almost every one but his own son.  He\nlooked down; and it seemed natural: for his eyes were swollen with\ncrying.  He had been crying as much as Proctor: but, then, so had Dale.\n\n\"Your school-fellow is doing well,\" said Mr Tooke, in a low voice,\nwhich, however, was heard to the farthest end of the room.  \"His brother\nwill tell you that he saw him quietly asleep; and I have just seen him\nso.  He deserves to do well; for he is a brave little boy.  He is the\nyoungest of you; but I doubt whether there is a more manly heart among\nyou all.\"\n\nThere was a murmur, as if everybody wished to agree to this.  That\nmurmur set Phil crying again.\n\n\"As to how this accident happened,\" continued the master, \"I have only\nto say this.  The coping-stone of the wall was loose,--had become\nloosened by the frost.  Of that I am aware.  But it would not,--it could\nnot have fallen, if your school-fellow had not been pulled from the top\nof the wall.  Several hands pulled him,--as many as could get a hold.\nWhose these hands were, it would be easy to ascertain; and it would not\nbe difficult to discover whose was the hand which first laid hold, and\ngave the rest their grasp.  But--\" How earnestly here did every one look\nfor the next words!--\"But your school-fellow considers the affair an\naccident,--says he himself was cross.\"\n\n\"No!  No!  We plagued him,\" cried many voices.\n\n\"Well!  He is sure no one meant him any harm, and earnestly desires that\nno further inquiry may be made.  For his part, nothing, he declares,\nshall ever induce him to tell who first seized him.\"\n\nThe boys were about to give a loud cheer, but stopped, for Hugh's sake,\njust in time.  There was no want of signs of what they felt.  There was\nno noise; but there were many tears.\n\n\"I do not think that a promise of impunity can be any great comfort to\nthose concerned,\" continued Mr Tooke: \"but such comfort as they can\nfind in it, they may.  Both from my wish to indulge one who has just\nsustained so great a misfortune, and because I think he is right, I\nshall never inquire,--never wish to know more than I do of the origin of\nthis accident.  His mother declares the same, on the part of both of his\nparents.  I hope you will every one feel yourselves put upon honour, to\nfollow my example.\"\n\nAnother general murmur, in sign of agreement.\n\n\"The only thing you can now do for your school-fellow,\" concluded the\nmaster, \"is to be quiet throughout the day.  As soon as he can be\nremoved, he will be carried to Mr Shaw's.  Till then, you will take\ncare that he loses no rest through you,--Now, first class, come up.\"\n\nWhile this class was up, Phil's neighbour began whispering; and the next\nboy leaned over to hear; and one or two came softly up behind: but,\nthough they were busily engaged in question and answer, the master's\nstern voice was not heard (as usual when there was talking) to say\n\"Silence there!\"  His class saw him looking that way, once or twice; but\nhe took no notice.  Phil had seen his brother, and was privileged to\ntell.\n\n\"So you saw him!  Did you get a real good sight of him?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I stayed some time; half-an-hour, I dare say.\"\n\n\"What did he look like?  Did he say anything?\"\n\n\"Say anything!\" cried Dale: \"why, did you not hear he was asleep?\"\n\n\"What did he look like, then?\"\n\n\"He looked as he always does when he is asleep, as far as I could see.\nBut we did not bring the light too near, for fear of waking him.\"\n\n\"Did you hear--did anybody tell you anything about it?\"\n\n\"Yes: my mother told me whatever I wanted to know.\"\n\n\"What?  What did she tell you?\"\n\n\"She says it will not be so very bad a lameness as it might have been--\nas if he had not had his knee left.  That makes a great difference.\nThey make a false foot now, very light; and if his leg gets quite\nproperly well, and we are not too much in a hurry, and we all take pains\nto help Hugh to practise walking carefully at first, he may not be very\nlame.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Then, it is not so bad,\" said one, while Tooke, who was listening,\ngave a deep sigh of relief.\n\n\"Not so bad!\" exclaimed Phil.  \"Why, he will never be so strong--so able\nand active as other men.  He will never be able to take care of himself\nand other people.  He will be so unlike other people always; and now,\nwhile he is a boy, he will never--\"\n\nThe images of poor Hugh's privations and troubles as a schoolboy were\ntoo much for Phil, and he laid down his head on his desk, to hide his\ngrief.  As for Tooke, he walked away, looking the picture of\nwretchedness.\n\n\"When will you see him again?\" asked Dale, passing his arm round Phil's\nneck.\n\n\"To-day, if he is pretty well.  My mother promised me that.\"\n\n\"Do you think you could get leave for me too?  I would not make any\nnoise, nor let him talk too much, if I might just see him.\"\n\n\"I'll see about it,\" said Phil.\n\nAs Mrs Proctor was placing the pillows comfortably, for Hugh to have\nhis breakfast, after he was washed, and the bed made nicely smooth, he\nyawned, and said he was sleepy still, and that he wondered what o'clock\nit was.  His mother told him it was a quarter past ten.\n\n\"A quarter past ten!  Why, how odd!  The boys are half through school,\nalmost, and I am only just awake!\"\n\n\"They slept through the whole night, I dare say.  You were awake a good\nmany times; and you and I had some talk.  Do you remember that?  Or has\nit gone out of your head with your sound sleep?\"\n\n\"No, no: I remember that,\" said Hugh.  \"But it was the oddest, longest\nnight!--and yesterday too!  To think that it is not a whole day yet\nsince it all happened!  Oh!  Here comes my breakfast.  What is it?\nCoffee!\"\n\n\"Yes: we know you are fond of coffee; and so am I.  So we will have some\ntogether.\"\n\n\"How comfortable!\" exclaimed Hugh; for he was really hungry; which was\nno wonder, after the pain and exhaustion he had gone through.  His state\nwas like that of a person recovering from an illness--extremely ready to\neat and drink, but obliged to be moderate.\n\nWhen warmed and cheered by his coffee, Hugh gave a broad hint that he\nshould like to see Phil, and one or two more boys--particularly Dale.\nHis mother told him that the surgeon, Mr Annanby, would be coming soon.\nIf he gave leave, Phil should come in, and perhaps Dale.  So Hugh was\nprepared with a strong entreaty to Mr Annanby on the subject; but no\nentreaty was needed.  Mr Annanby thought he was doing very well; and\nthat he would not be the worse for a little amusement and a little\nfatigue this morning, if it did not go on too long.  So Phil was sent\nfor, when the surgeon was gone.  As he entered, his mother went out to\nspeak to Mr Tooke, and write home.\n\nShe then heard from Mr Tooke and from Firth and Dale, how strong was\nthe feeling in Hugh's favour--how strong the sympathy for his misfortune\nthroughout the school.  Hugh had seen no tears from her; but she shed\nthem now.  She then earnestly entreated that Hugh might not hear what\nshe had just been told.  He felt no doubt of the kindness of his\nschoolfellows, and was therefore quite happy on that score.  He was very\nyoung, and to a certain degree vain; and if this event went to\nstrengthen his vanity, to fill his head with selfish thoughts, it would\nbe a misfortune indeed.  The loss of his foot would be the least part of\nit.  It lay with those about him to make this event a deep injury to\nhim, instead of the blessing which all trials are meant by Providence\neventually to be.  They all promised that, while treating Hugh with the\ntenderness he deserved, they would not spoil the temper in which he had\nacted so well, by making it vain and selfish.  There was no fear,\nmeantime, of Phil's doing him any harm in that way; for Phil had a great\nidea of the privileges and dignity of seniority; and his plan was to\nkeep down little boys, and make them humble; not being aware that to\nkeep people down is not the way to make them humble, but the contrary.\nOlder people than Phil, however, often fall into this mistake.  Many\nparents do, and many teachers; and very many elder brothers and sisters.\n\nPhil entered the room shyly, and stood by the fire, so that the\nbed-curtain was between him and Hugh.\n\n\"Are you there, Phil?\" cried Hugh, pulling aside the curtain.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Phil; \"how do you do this morning?\"\n\n\"Oh, very well.  Come here.  I want to know ever so many things.  Have\nyou heard yet anything real and true about the new usher?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Phil.  \"But I have no doubt it is really Mr Crabbe who is\ncoming, and that he will be here after Christmas.  Why, Hugh, you look\njust the same as usual!\"\n\n\"So I am just the same, except under this thing,\" pointing to the hoop,\nor basket, which was placed over his limb, to keep off the weight of the\nbed-clothes.  \"I am not hurt anywhere else, except this bruise;\" and he\nshowed a black bruise on his arm, such as almost any schoolboy can show,\nalmost any day.\n\n\"That's nothing,\" pronounced Phil.\n\n\"The other was, though, I can tell you,\" declared Hugh.\n\n\"Was it very, very bad?  Worse than you had ever fancied?\"\n\n\"Oh!  Yes.  I could have screamed myself to death.  I did not, though.\nDid you hear me, did anybody hear me call out?\"\n\n\"I heard you--just outside the door there--before the doctors came.\"\n\n\"Ah!  But not after, not while uncle was here.  He cried so!  I could\nnot call out while was he crying so.  Where were you when they were\ndoing it?\"\n\n\"Just outside the door there.  I heard you once--only once; and that was\nnot much.\"\n\n\"But how came you to be there?  It was past bedtime.  Had you leave to\nbe up so late?\"\n\n\"I did not ask it; and nobody meddled with me.\"\n\n\"Was anybody there with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Firth.  Dale would not.  He was afraid and he kept away.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Is not he very sorry?\"\n\n\"Of course.  Nobody can help being sorry.\"\n\n\"Do they all seem sorry?  What did they do?  What do they say?\"\n\n\"Oh!  They are very sorry; you must know that.\"\n\n\"Anybody more than the rest?\"\n\n\"Why some few of them cried; but I don't know that that shows them to be\nmore sorry.  It is some people's way to cry--and others not.\"\n\nHugh wished much to learn something about Tooke; but, afraid of showing\nwhat was in his thoughts, he went off to quite another subject.\n\n\"Do you know, Phil,\" said he, \"you would hardly believe it, but I have\nnever been half so miserable as I was the first day or two I came here?\nI don't care now, half so much, for all the pain, and for being lame,\nand--Oh!  But I can never be a soldier or a sailor--I can never go round\nthe world!  I forgot that.\"\n\nAnd poor Hugh hid his face in his pillow.\n\n\"Never mind!\" said Phil, stooping over him very kindly.  \"Here is a long\ntime before you; and you will get to like something else just as well.\nPapa wanted to be a soldier, remember, and could not; and he is as happy\nas ever he can be, now that he is a shop-keeper in London.  Did you ever\nsee anybody merrier than my father is?  I never did.  Come!  Cheer up,\nHugh!  You will be very happy somehow.\"\n\nPhil kissed him: and when Hugh looked up in surprise, Phil's eyes were\nfull of tears.\n\n\"Now I have a good mind to ask you,\" said Hugh, \"something that has been\nin my mind ever since.\"\n\n\"Ever since when?\"\n\n\"Ever since I came to Crofton.  What could be the reason that you were\nnot more kind to me then?\"\n\n\"I!  Not kind?\" said Phil, in some confusion.  \"Was not I kind?\"\n\n\"No.  At least I thought not.  I was so uncomfortable,--I did not know\nanybody, or what to do; and I expected you would show me, and help me.\nI always thought I could not have felt lonely with you here; and then\nwhen I came, you got out of my way, as if you were ashamed of me, and\nyou did not help me at all; and you laughed at me.\"\n\n\"No; I don't think I did that.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did, indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, little boys always have to shift for themselves when\nthey go to a great school--\"\n\n\"But why, if they have brothers there?  That is the very thing I want to\nknow.  I think it is very cruel.\"\n\n\"I never meant to be cruel, of course.  But--but--the boys were all\nready to laugh at me about a little brother that was scarcely any better\nthan a girl;--and consider how you talked on the coach, and what\nridiculous hair you had,--and what a fuss you made about your money and\nyour pocket,--and how you kept popping out things about Miss Harold, and\nthe girls, and Susan.\"\n\n\"You _were_ ashamed of me, then.\"\n\n\"Well, what wonder if I was?\"\n\n\"And you never told me about all these things.  You let me learn them\nall without any warning, or any help.\"\n\n\"To be sure.  That is the way all boys have to get on.  They must make\ntheir own way.\"\n\n\"If ever little Harry comes to Crofton,\" said Hugh, more to himself than\nto Phil, \"I will not leave him in the lurch,--I will never be ashamed of\nhim.  Pray,\" said he, turning quickly to Phil, \"are you ashamed of me\nstill?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" protested Phil.  \"You can shift for yourself,--you can play,\nand do everything like other boys, now.  You--\"\n\nHe stopped short, overcome with the sudden recollection that Hugh would\nnever again be able to play like other boys,--to be like them in\nstrength, and in shifting for himself.\n\n\"Ah!  I see what you are thinking of,\" said Hugh.  \"I am so afraid you\nshould be ashamed of me again, when I come into the playground.  The\nboys will quiz me;--and if you are ashamed of me--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" earnestly declared Phil.  \"There is nobody in the world\nthat will quiz you;--or, if there is, they had better take care of me, I\ncan tell them.  But nobody will.  You don't know how sorry the boys are.\nHere comes Dale.  He will tell you the same thing.\"\n\nDale was quite sure that any boy would, from this time for ever, be sent\nto Coventry who should quiz Hugh for his lameness.  There was not a boy\nnow at Crofton who would not do anything in the world to help him.\n\n\"Why, Dale, how you have been crying!\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"Is anything\nwrong in school?  Can't you manage your verses yet?\"\n\n\"I'll try that to-night,\" said Dale, cheerfully.  \"Yes; I'll manage\nthem.  Never mind what made my eyes red; only, if such a thing had\nhappened to me, you would have cried,--I am sure of that.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Phil.\n\n\"Now, Proctor, you had better go,\" said Dale.  \"One at a time is enough\nto-day; and I shall not stay long.\"\n\nPhil agreed, and actually shook hands with Hugh before he went.\n\n\"Phil is so kind to-day!\" cried Hugh, with glee; \"though he is\ndisappointed of going to uncle Shaw's on my account.  And I know he had\nreckoned on it.  Now, I want to know one thing,--where did Mr Tooke\nsleep last night?  For this is his bed.\"\n\nDale believed he slept on the sofa.  He was sure, at least, that he had\nnot taken off his clothes; for he had come to the door several times in\nthe course of the night, to know how all was going on.\n\n\"Why, I never knew that!\" cried Hugh.  \"I suppose I was asleep.  Dale,\nwhat do you think is the reason that our fathers and mothers and people\ntake care of us as they do?\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, Agnes and I cannot make it out.  When we were by the sea-side,\nmother took us a great way along the beach, to a place we did not know\nat all; and she bade us pick up shells, and amuse ourselves, while she\nwent to see a poor woman that lived just out of sight.  We played till\nwe were quite tired; and then we sat down; and still she did not come.\nAt last, we were sure that she had forgotten all about us; and we did\nnot think she would remember us any more: and we both cried.  Oh!  How\nwe did cry!  Then a woman came along, with a basket at her back, and a\ngreat net over her arm: and she asked us what was the matter; and when\nwe told her, she said she thought it was not likely that mother would\nforget us.  And then she bade us take hold of her gown, one on each\nside, and she would try to take us to mother; and the next thing was\nmother came in sight.  When the woman told her what we had said, they\nboth laughed; and mother told us it was impossible that she should leave\nus behind.  I asked Agnes afterwards why it was impossible; and she did\nnot know; and I am sure she was as glad as I was to see mother come in\nsight.  If she really never can forget us, what makes her remember us?\"\n\nDale shook his head.  He could not tell.\n\n\"Because,\" continued Hugh, \"we can't do anything for anybody, and we\ngive a great deal of trouble.  Mother sits up very late, sometimes till\nnear twelve, mending our things.  There is that great basket of\nstockings she has to mend, once a fortnight!  And papa works very hard\nto get money; and what a quantity he pays for our schooling, and our\nclothes, and everything!\"\n\n\"Everybody would think it very shameful if he did not,\" suggested Dale.\n\"If he let you go ragged and ignorant, it would be wicked.\"\n\n\"But why?\" said Hugh, vehemently.  \"That is what I want to know.  We are\nnot worth anything.  We are nothing but trouble.  Only think what so\nmany people did yesterday!  My mother came a journey; and uncle and aunt\nShaw came: and mother sat up all night; and Mr Tooke never went to\nbed,--and all about me!  I declare I can't think why.\"\n\nDale felt as if he knew why; but he could not explain it.  Mrs Proctor\nhad heard much of what they were saying.  She had come in before closing\nher letter to Mr Proctor, to ask whether Hugh wished to send any\nparticular message home.  As she listened, she was too sorry to feel\namused.  She perceived that she could not have done her whole duty to\nher children, if there could be such a question as this in their\nhearts--such a question discussed between them, unknown to her.  She\nspoke now; and Hugh started, for he was not aware that she was in the\nroom.\n\nShe asked both the boys why they thought it was that, before little\nbirds are fledged, the parent birds bring them food, as often as once in\na minute, all day long for some weeks.  Perhaps no creatures can go\nthrough harder work than this; and why do they do it?  For unfledged\nbirds, which are capable of nothing whatever but clamouring for food,\nare as useless little creatures as can be imagined.  Why does the cat\ntake care of her little blind kitten with so much watchfulness, hiding\nit from all enemies till it can take care of itself.  It is because love\ndoes not depend on the value of the creature loved--it is because love\ngrows up in our hearts at God's pleasure, and not by our own choice; and\nit is God's pleasure that the weakest and the least useful and\nprofitable should be the most beloved, till they become able to love and\nhelp in their turn.\n\n\"Is it possible, my dear,\" she said to Hugh, \"that you did not know\nthis,--you who love little Harry so much, and take such care of him at\nhome?  I am sure you never stopped to think whether Harry could do you\nany service, before helping him to play.\"\n\n\"No; but then--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"He is such a sweet little fellow, it is a treat to look at him.  Every\nmorning when I woke, I longed to be up, and to get to him.\"\n\n\"That is, you loved him.  Well: your papa and I love you all, in the\nsame way.  We get up with pleasure to our business--your father to his\nshop, and I to my work-basket--because it is the greatest happiness in\nthe world to serve those we love.\"\n\nHugh said nothing; but still, though pleased, he did not look quite\nsatisfied.\n\n\"Susan and cook are far more useful to me than any of you children,\"\ncontinued his mother, \"and yet I could not work early and late for them,\nwith the same pleasure as for you.\"\n\nHugh laughed; and then he asked whether Jane was not now as useful as\nSusan.\n\n\"Perhaps she is,\" replied his mother; \"and the more she learns and does,\nand the more she becomes my friend,--the more I respect her: but it is\nimpossible to love her more than I did before she could speak or walk.\nThere is some objection in your mind still, my dear.  What is it?\"\n\n\"It makes us of so much consequence,--so much more than I ever thought\nof,--that the minds of grown people should be busy about us.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be vain of in that, my dear, any more than for\nyoung kittens, and birds just hatched.  But it is very true that all\nyoung creatures are of great consequence; for they are the children of\nGod.  When, besides this, we consider what human beings are,--that they\ncan never perish, but are to live for ever,--and that they are meant to\nbecome more wise and holy than we can imagine, we see that the feeblest\ninfant is indeed a being of infinite consequence.  This is surely a\nreason for God filling the hearts of parents with love, and making them\nwilling to work and suffer for their children, even while the little\nones are most unwise and unprofitable.  When you and Agnes fancied I\nshould forget you and desert you, you must have forgotten that you had\nanother Parent who rules the hearts of all the fathers and mothers on\nearth.\"\n\nHugh was left alone to think this over, when he had given his messages\nhome, and got Dale's promise to come again as soon as he could obtain\nleave to do so.  Both the boys were warned that this would not be till\nto-morrow, as Hugh had seen quite company enough for one day.  Indeed,\nhe slept so much, that night seemed to be soon come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. LITTLE VICTORIES.\n\nThough Mr Tooke was so busy from having no usher, he found time to come\nand see Hugh pretty often.  He had a sofa moved into that room: and he\ncarried Hugh, without hurting him at all, and laid him down there\ncomfortably, beside the fire.  He took his tea there, with Mrs Proctor;\nand he brought up his newspaper, and read from it anything which he\nthought would amuse the boy.  He smiled at Hugh's scruple about\noccupying his room, and assured him that he was quite as well off in Mr\nCarnaby's room, except that it was not so quiet as this, and therefore\nmore fit for a person in health than for an invalid.  Mr Tooke not only\nbrought up plenty of books from the school library, but lent Hugh some\nvaluable volumes of prints from his own shelves.\n\nHugh could not look at these for long together.  His head soon began to\nache, and his eyes to be dazzled; for he was a good deal weakened.  His\nmother observed also that he became too eager about views in foreign\ncountries, and that he even grew impatient in his temper when talking\nabout them.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" said she one evening, after tea, when she saw him in this\nstate, and that it rather perplexed Mr Tooke, \"if you remember your\nresolution, I think you will put away that book.\"\n\n\"O, mother!\" exclaimed he, \"you want to take away the greatest pleasure\nI have!\"\n\n\"If it is a pleasure, go on.  I was afraid it was becoming a pain.\"\n\nMr Tooke did not ask what this meant; but he evidently wished to know.\nHe soon knew, for Hugh found himself growing more fidgety and more\ncross, the further he looked in the volume of Indian Views, till he\nthrew himself back upon the sofa, and stuffed his handkerchief into his\nmouth, and stared at the fire, struggling, as his mother saw, to help\ncrying.  \"I will take away the book,--shall I, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.  O dear!  I shall never keep my vow, I know.\"\n\nMrs Proctor told Mr Tooke that Hugh had made a resolution which she\nearnestly hoped he might be able to keep;--to bear cheerfully every\ndisappointment and trouble caused by this accident, from the greatest to\nthe least,--from being obliged to give up being a traveller by-and-by,\nto the shoemaker's wondering that he wanted only one shoe.  Now, if\nlooking at pictures of foreign countries made him less cheerful, it\nseemed to belong to his resolution to give up that pleasure for the\npresent.  Hugh acknowledged that it did; and Mr Tooke, who was pleased\nat what he heard, carried away the Indian Views, and brought instead a\nvery fine work on Trades, full of plates representing people engaged in\nevery kind of trade and manufacture.  Hugh was too tired to turn over\nany more pages to-night: but his master said the book might stay in the\nroom now, and when Hugh was removed, it might go with him; and, as he\nwas able to sit up more, he might like to copy some of the plates.\n\n\"Removed!\" exclaimed Hugh.\n\nHis mother smiled, and told him that he was going on so well that he\nmight soon now be removed to his uncle's.\n\n\"Where,\" said Mr Tooke, \"you will have more quiet and more liberty than\nyou can have here.  Your brother, and any other boys you like, can run\nover to see you at any time; and you will be out of the noise of the\nplayground.\"\n\n\"I wonder how it is there is so little noise from the playground here,\"\nsaid Hugh.\n\n\"It is because the boys have been careful to make no noise since your\naccident.  We cannot expect them to put themselves under such restraint\nfor long.\"\n\n\"O no, no!  I had better go.  But, mother, you--you--aunt Shaw is very\nkind, but--\"\n\n\"I shall stay with you as long as you want me.\"\n\nHugh was quite happy.\n\n\"But how in the world shall I get there?\" he presently asked.  \"It is\ntwo whole miles; and we can't lay my leg up in the gig: besides its\nbeing so cold.\"\n\nHis mother told him that his uncle had a very nice plan for his\nconveyance.  Mr Annanby approved of it, and thought he might be moved\nthe first sunny day.\n\n\"What, to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes, if the sun shines.\"\n\nMr Tooke unbolted the shutter, and declared that it was such a bright\nstarry evening that he thought to-morrow would be fine.\n\nThe morning was fine; and during the very finest part of it came Mr\nShaw.  He told Hugh that there was a good fire blazing at home in the\nback room that looked into the garden, which was to be Hugh's.  From the\nsofa by the fire-side one might see the laurustinus on the grass-plot,--\nnow covered with flowers: and when the day was warm enough to let him\nlie in the window, he could see the mill, and all that was going on\nround it.\n\nHugh liked the idea of all this: but he still looked anxious.\n\n\"Now tell me,\" said his uncle, \"what person in all the world you would\nlike best for a companion?\"\n\n\"In all the world!\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"Suppose I say the Great Mogul!\"\n\n\"Well; tell us how to catch him, and we will try.  Meantime, you can\nhave his picture.  I believe we have a pack of cards in the house.\"\n\n\"But do you mean really, uncle,--the person I should like best in all\nthe world,--out of Crofton?\"\n\n\"Yes; out with it!\"\n\n\"I should like Agnes best,\" said Hugh, timidly.\n\n\"We thought as much.  I am glad we were right.  Well, my boy, Agnes is\nthere.\"\n\n\"Agnes there!  Only two miles off!  How long will she stay?\"\n\n\"O, there is no hurry about that.  We shall see when you are well what\nto do next.\"\n\n\"But will she stay till the holidays?\"\n\n\"O yes, longer than that, I hope.\"\n\n\"But then she will not go home with me for the holidays?\"\n\n\"Never mind about the holidays now.  Your holidays begin to-day.  You\nhave nothing to do but to get well now, and make yourself at home at my\nhouse, and be merry with Agnes.  Now shall we go, while the sun shines?\nHere is your mother all cloaked up in her warm things.\"\n\n\"O, mother!  Agnes is come,\" cried Hugh.\n\nThis was no news; for it was his mother who had guessed what companion\nhe would like to have.  She now showed her large warm cloak, in which\nHugh was to be wrapped; and his neck was muffled up in a comforter.\n\n\"But how am I to go?\" asked Hugh, trembling with this little bustle.\n\n\"Quietly in your bed,\" said his uncle.  \"Come, I will lift you into it.\"\n\nAnd his uncle carried him down-stairs to the front door, where two of\nMr Shaw's men stood with a litter, which was slung upon poles, and\ncarried like a sedan-chair.  There was a mattress upon the litter, on\nwhich Hugh lay as comfortably as on a sofa.  He said it was like being\ncarried in a palanquin in India,--if only there was hot sunshine, and no\nfrost and snow.\n\nMr Tooke, and Mrs Watson, and Firth shook hands with Hugh, and said\nthey should be glad to see him back again: and Mr Tooke added that some\nof the boys should visit him pretty often till the breaking-up.  Nobody\nelse was allowed to come quite near; but the boys clustered at that side\nof the playground, to see as much as they could.  Hugh waved his hand;\nand every boy saw it; and in a moment every hat and cap was off, and the\nboys gave three cheers,--the loudest that had ever been heard at\nCrofton.  The most surprising thing was that Mr Tooke cheered, and Mr\nShaw too.  The men looked as if they would have liked to set down the\nlitter, and cheer too: but they did not quite do that.  They only smiled\nas if they were pleased.\n\nThere was one person besides who did not cheer.  Tooke stood apart from\nthe other boys, looking very sad.  As the litter went down the by-road,\nhe began to walk away; but Hugh begged the men to stop, and called to\nTooke.  Tooke turned: and when Hugh beckoned, he forgot all about\nbounds, leaped the paling, and came running.  Hugh said,--\n\n\"I have been wanting to see you so!  But I did not like to ask for you\nparticularly.\"\n\n\"I wish I had known that.\"\n\n\"Come and see me,--do,\" said Hugh.  \"Come the very first, wont you?\"\n\n\"If I may.\"\n\n\"Oh, you may, I know.\"\n\n\"Well, I will, thank you.  Good-bye.\"\n\nAnd on went the litter, with Mrs Proctor and Mr Shaw walking beside\nit.  The motion did not hurt Hugh at all; and he was so warmly wrapped\nup, and the day so fine, that he was almost sorry when the two miles\nwere over.  And yet there was Agnes out upon the steps; and she sat\nbeside him on the sofa in his cheerful room, and told him that she had\nnothing to do but to wait on him, and play with him.  She did not tell\nhim yet that she must learn directly to nurse him, and, with her aunt's\nhelp, fill her mother's place, because her mother was much wanted at\nhome: but this was in truth one chief reason for her coming.\n\nThough there was now really nothing the matter with Hugh--though he ate,\ndrank, slept, and gained strength--his mother would not leave him till\nshe saw him well able to go about.\n\nThe carpenter soon came, with some crutches he had borrowed for Hugh to\ntry; and when they were sure of the right length, Hugh had a new pair.\nHe found it rather nervous work at first, using them; and he afterwards\nlaughed at the caution with which he began.  First, he had somebody to\nlift him from his seat, and hold him till he was firm on his crutches.\nThen he carefully moved forwards one crutch at a time, and then the\nother; and he put so much strength into it, that he was quite tired when\nhe had been once across the room and back again.  Every stumble made him\nshake all over.  He made Agnes try; and he was almost provoked to see\nhow lightly she could hop about; but then, as he said, she could put a\nsecond foot down to save herself, whenever she pleased.  Every day,\nhowever, walking became easier to him; and he even discovered, when\naccidentally left alone, and wanting something from the opposite end of\nthe room, that he could rise, and set forth by himself, and be\nindependent.  And in one of these excursions it was that he found the\ntruth of what Agnes had told him--how much easier it was to move both\ncrutches together.  When he showed his mother this, she said she thought\nhe would soon learn to do with only one.\n\nHugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes--such as\nno one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to pity\nas they deserved.  A surprise of this sort happened to him the evening\nbefore his father was to come to see him, and to fetch away his mother.\n\nIt was the dark hour in the afternoon--the hour when Mrs Proctor and\nher children enjoyed every day a quiet talk, before Mr Shaw came to\ncarry Hugh into his aunt's parlour to tea.  Nothing could be merrier\nthan Hugh had been; and his mother and Agnes were chatting, when they\nthought they heard a sob from the sofa.  They spoke to Hugh, and found\nthat he was indeed crying bitterly.\n\n\"What is it, my dear?\" said his mother.  \"Agnes, have we said anything\nthat could hurt him?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" sobbed Hugh.  \"I will tell you presently.\"\n\nAnd presently he told them that he was so busy listening to what they\nsaid, that he forgot everything else, when he felt as if something had\ngot between two of his toes; unconsciously he put his hand down; and his\nfoot was not there!  Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in his\ntoes: and, then, when he put out his hand, and found nothing, it was so\nterrible--it startled him so.\n\nIt was a comfort to him to find that his mother knew all about this.\nShe came and kneeled beside his sofa, and told him that many persons who\nhad lost a limb considered this odd feeling the most painful thing they\nhad to bear for some time; but that, though the feeling would return\noccasionally through life, it would cease to be painful.  When he had\nbecome so used to do without his foot as to leave off wanting or wishing\nfor it, he would perhaps make a joke of the feeling, instead of being\ndisappointed.  At least she knew that some persons did so who had lost a\nlimb.\n\nThis did not comfort Hugh much, for every prospect had suddenly become\ndarkened.  He said he did not know how he should bear his misfortune;--\nhe was pretty sure he could not bear it.  It seemed so long already\nsince it had happened!  And when he thought of the long long days, and\nmonths, and years, to the end of his life, and that he should never run\nand play, and never be like other people, and never able to do the\ncommonest things without labour and trouble, he wished he was dead.  He\nhad rather have died.\n\nAgnes thought he must be miserable indeed, if he could venture to say\nthis to his mother.  She glanced at her mother's face; but there was no\ndispleasure there.  Mrs Proctor said this feeling was very natural.\nShe had felt it herself, under smaller misfortunes than Hugh's; but she\nhad found that, though the prospect appears all strewn with troubles,\nthey come singly, and are not worth minding, after all.  She told Hugh\nthat, when she was a little girl, very lazy--fond of her bed--fond of\nher book--and not at all fond of washing and dressing--\n\n\"Why, mother, you!\" exclaimed Hugh.\n\n\"Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was.  Well, I was in despair,\none day, at the thought that I should have to wash, and clean my teeth,\nand brush my hair, and put on every daily article of dress every\nmorning, as long as I lived.  There was nothing I disliked so much; and\nyet it was the thing that must be done every day of my whole life.\"\n\n\"Did you tell anybody?\" asked Hugh.\n\n\"No; I was ashamed to do that: but I remember I cried.  You see how it\nturns out.  Grown people, who have got to do everything by habit, so\neasily as not to think about it, wash and dress every morning, without\never being weary of it.  We do not consider so much as once a year what\nwe are doing at dressing-time, though at seven years old it is a very\nlaborious and tiresome affair to get ready for breakfast.\"\n\n\"It is the same about writing letters,\" observed Agnes.  \"The first\nletter I ever wrote was to Aunt Shaw; and it took so long, and was so\ntiresome, that, when I thought of all the exercises I should have to\nwrite for Miss Harold, and all the letters that I must send to my\nrelations when I grew up, I would have given everything I had in the\nworld not to have learned to write.  Oh!  How I pitied papa, when I saw\nsometimes the pile of letters that were lying to go to the post!\"\n\n\"And how do you like corresponding with Phil now?\"\n\nAgnes owned, with blushes, that she still dreaded the task for some days\nbefore, and felt particularly gay when it was done.  Her mother believed\nthat, if infants could think and look forward, they would be far more\nterrified with the prospect of having to walk on their two legs all\ntheir lives, than lame people could be at having to learn the art in\npart over again.  Grown people are apt to doubt whether they can learn a\nnew language, though children make no difficulty about it: the reason of\nwhich is, that grown people see at one view the whole labour, while\nchildren do not look beyond their daily task.  Experience, however,\nalways brings relief.  Experience shows that every effort comes at its\nproper time, and that there is variety or rest in the intervals.  People\nwho have to wash and dress every morning have other things to do in the\nafter part of the day; and, as the old fable tells us, the clock that\nhas to tick, before it is worn out, so many millions of times, as it\nperplexes the mind to think of, has exactly the same number of seconds\nto do it in; so that it never has more work on its hands than it can get\nthrough.  So Hugh would find that he could move about on each separate\noccasion, as he wanted; and practice would, in time, enable him to do it\nwithout any more thought than it now cost him to put all the bones of\nhis hands in order, so as to carry his tea and bread-and-butter to his\nmouth.\n\n\"But that is not all--nor half what I mean,\" said Hugh.  \"No, my dear;\nnor half what you will have to make up your mind to bear.  You will have\na great deal to bear, Hugh.  You resolved to bear it all patiently, I\nremember: but what is it that you dread the most?\"\n\n\"Oh!  All manner of things.  I can never do things like other people.\"\n\n\"Some things.  You can never play cricket, as every Crofton boy would\nlike to do.  You can never dance at your sisters' Christmas parties.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Mamma!\" cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and the thought in\nher mind that it was cruel to talk so.\n\n\"Go on!  Go on!\" cried Hugh, brightening.  \"You know what I feel,\nmother; and you don't keep telling me, as Aunt Shaw does (and even Agnes\nsometimes), that it wont signify much, and that I shall not care, and\nall that; making out that it is no misfortune hardly, when I know what\nit is, and they don't.\"\n\n\"That is a common way of trying to give comfort, and it is kindly\nmeant,\" said Mrs Proctor.  \"But those who have suffered much themselves\nknow a better way.  The best way is not to deny any of the trouble or\nthe sorrow, and not to press on the sufferer any comforts which he\ncannot now see and enjoy.  If comforts arise, he will enjoy them as they\ncome.\"\n\n\"Now then, go on,\" said Hugh.  \"What else?\"\n\n\"There will be little checks and mortifications continually--when you\nsee boys leaping over this, and climbing that, and playing at the other,\nwhile you must stand out, and can only look on.  And some people will\npity you in a way you don't like; and some may even laugh at you.\"\n\n\"O mamma!\" exclaimed Agnes.\n\n\"I have seen and heard children in the street do it,\" replied Mrs\nProctor.  \"This is a thing almost below notice; but I mentioned it while\nwe were reckoning up our troubles.\"\n\n\"Well, what else?\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Sooner or later, you will have to follow some way of life, determined\nby this accident, instead of one that you would have liked better.  But\nwe need not think of this yet:--not till you have become quite\naccustomed to your lameness.\"\n\n\"Well, what else?\"\n\n\"I must ask you now.  I can think of nothing more; and I hope there is\nnot much else; for indeed I think here is quite enough for a boy--or any\none else--to bear.\"\n\n\"I will bear it, though,--you will see.\"\n\n\"You will find great helps.  These misfortunes, of themselves,\nstrengthen one's mind.  They have some advantages too.  You will be a\nbetter scholar for your lameness, I have no doubt.  You will read more\nbooks, and have a mind richer in thoughts.  You will be more beloved;--\nnot out of mere pity; for people in general will soon leave off pitying\nyou, when once you learn to be active again; but because you have kept\nfaith with your schoolfellows, and shown that you can bear pain.  Yes,\nyou will be more loved by us all; and you yourself will love God more\nfor having given you something to bear for his sake.\"\n\n\"I hope so,--I think so,\" said Hugh.  \"O mother!  I may be very happy\nyet.\"\n\n\"Very happy; and, when you have once made up your mind to everything,\nthe less you think and speak about it, the happier you will be.  It is\nvery right for us now, when it is all new, and strange, and painful, to\ntalk it well over; to face it completely; but when your mind is made up,\nand you are a Crofton boy again, you will not wish to speak much of your\nown concerns, unless it be to me, or to Agnes, sometimes, when your\nheart is full.\"\n\n\"Or to Dale, when you are far off.\"\n\n\"Yes,--to Dale, or some one friend at Crofton.  But there is only one\nFriend that one is quite sure to get strength from,--the same who has\ngiven strength to all the brave people that ever lived, and comfort to\nall sufferers.  When the greatest of all sufferers wanted relief, what\ndid He do?\"\n\n\"He went by Himself, and prayed,\" said Agnes.\n\n\"Yes, that is the way,\" observed Hugh, as if he knew by experience.\n\nMr Shaw presently came, to say that tea was ready.\n\n\"I am too big a baby to be carried now,\" cried Hugh, gaily.  \"Let me try\nif I cannot go alone.\"\n\n\"Why,--there is the step at the parlour-door,\" said Mr Shaw,\ndoubtfully.  \"At any rate, stop till I bring a light.\"\n\nBut Hugh followed close upon his uncle's heels, and was over the step\nbefore his aunt supposed he was half way across the hall.  After tea,\nhis uncle and he were so full of play, that the ladies could hardly hear\none another speak till Hugh was gone to bed, too tired to laugh any\nmore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. DOMESTIC MANNERS.\n\nAfter Mr Proctor had come and was gone, and Mrs Proctor was gone with\nhim, Hugh began to wonder why Tooke had never paid the visit he had\npromised.  Several boys had called; some to thank Hugh for balls that he\nhad quilted; some to see how he got on; and some to bring him Crofton\nnews.  Mr Tooke had fastened his horse up at the door, in passing, and\nstepped in for a few minutes, two or three times a week: but it was now\nwithin six days of the holidays, and the one Hugh most wished to see had\nnot appeared.  His uncle observed his wistful look when the door-bell\nrang, and drew his conclusions.  He said, on the Wednesday before the\nbreaking-up, that he was going to drive past the Crofton school; that it\nwas such a fine day that he thought Hugh might go with him, and perhaps\nthey might persuade some one to come home to dinner with them.\n\nHugh had never enjoyed the open air more than during this drive.  He had\nyet much to learn about the country, and it was all as beautiful as it\nwas new.  His uncle pointed out to him the fieldfares wheeling in flocks\nover the fallows; and the rabbits in the warren, scampering away with\ntheir little white tails turned up; and the robin hopping in the frosty\npathway; and the wild ducks splashing among the reeds in the marshes.\nThey saw the cottagers' children trying to collect snow enough from the\nsmall remains of the drifts to make snow-balls, and obliged to throw\naway the dirty snow that would melt, and would not bind.  As they left\nthe road, and turned through a copse, because Mr Shaw had business with\nMr Sullivan's gamekeeper, a pheasant flew out, whirring, from some\nferns and brambles, and showed its long tail-feathers before it\ndisappeared over the hedge.  All these sights were new to Hugh: and all,\nafter pain and confinement, looked beautiful and gay.\n\nMr Shaw could not stop for Hugh to get out at Crofton; so, when his\narrival was seen, the boys were allowed to go out of bounds, as far as\nthe gig, to speak to their school-fellow.  Mr Shaw asked Tooke to\nmount, and go home with them for the day; and Tooke was so pleased,--so\nagreeably surprised to see Hugh look quite well and merry, that he\nwillingly ran off to ask leave, and to wash his face, and change his\njacket.  When he had jumped in, and Hugh had bidden the rest good-bye, a\nsudden shyness came over his poor conscious visitor: and it was not\nlessened by Mr Shaw telling Tooke that he did not do credit to Crofton\nair,--so puny as he seemed: and that he looked at that moment more like\none that had had a bad accident than Hugh did.  When Mr Shaw perceived\nhow the boy's eyes filled with tears in an instant, he probably thought\nwithin himself that Tooke was sadly weak-spirited, and altogether more\ndelicate than he had been aware of.\n\nHugh was full of questions about Crofton matters, however; and long\nbefore they reached Mr Shaw's, they were chattering as busily as\npossible.  But then it was all spoiled to Tooke again by seeing Hugh\nlifted out, and his crutches brought to him, and Agnes ready to take his\nhat and cloak, instead of his being able to run about, doing everything\nfor himself.\n\nThe sofa had been left in Hugh's room, and there was a fire there every\nafternoon, for him and Agnes, that their aunt might have the parlour to\nherself till tea-time.  The three young people went therefore to this\nroom after dinner.  Agnes felt a little uncomfortable, as she always did\nwhen any Crofton boys came.  They had so much to say to each other of\nthings that she did not understand, and so very little to say to her,\nthat she continually felt as if she was in the way.  When she proposed,\nas usual, that Hugh should go through his exercises in walking and\nrunning (for she was indefatigable in helping him to learn to walk well,\nand superintended his practice every afternoon), he refused hastily and\nrather rudely.  Of course, she could not know that he had a reason for\nwishing not to show off his lameness before Tooke; and she thought him\nunkind.  He might indeed have remembered to ask her before to say\nnothing this afternoon about his exercises.  She took out her work, and\nsat down at some distance from the boys; but they did not get on.  It\nwas very awkward.  At last, the boys' eyes met, and they saw that they\nshould like to talk freely, if they could.\n\n\"Agnes,\" said Hugh, \"cannot you go somewhere, and leave us alone?\"\n\n\"I hardly know where I can go,\" replied Agnes.  \"I must not disturb\naunt; and there is no fire anywhere else.\"\n\n\"O, I am sure aunt won't mind, for this one afternoon.  You can be still\nas a mouse; and she can doze away, as if nobody was there.\"\n\n\"I can be as still as a mouse here,\" observed Agnes.  \"I can take my\nwork to that farthest window; and if you whisper, I shall not hear a\nword you say.  Or, if I do hear a word, I will tell you directly.  And\nyou will let me come, now and then, and warm myself, if I find I cannot\nhold my needle any longer.\"\n\n\"No, no; that won't do.  We can't talk so.  Do just go, and see whether\naunt cannot let you be there for this one afternoon.\"\n\nAgnes did not like to refuse anything to Hugh: but she hesitated to take\nsuch a bold step as this.  In his eagerness, Hugh requested the same\nfavour of Tooke; but Tooke, more anxious even than Agnes to oblige, had\nnot courage for such an errand.  Hugh snatched his crutches, and\ndeclared he would go himself.  But now Agnes gave way.  She gathered up\nher work, and left the room.  Hugh little imagined where she went, this\ncold, darkening December afternoon.  She went to her own room, put on\nher cloak, and walked up and down till tea was ready, without fire or\ncandle, and not very happy in her mind.\n\nMeanwhile the boys basked before a glowing fire.  Tooke began directly\nto open his full heart.\n\n\"Was that true that your sister said at dinner, about your always\nlonging so to come to Crofton!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How sorry you must be that you came!  How you must wish that you had\nnever seen me!\"\n\n\"I knew that there would be things to bear, whenever I came; and\nparticularly while I was the youngest.  Your father told me that: and\none of the things that made me want to come more than ever was his\ntelling me how you bore things when you were the youngest--being set on\nthe top of that wall, and so on.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I never meant to hurt you when I pulled your foot--I\nsuppose you are quite sure that it was I that gave the first pull?  Are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; I am sure of that; and so are you: but I know very well that\nyou meant no harm; and that is the reason I would not tell.  After what\nyou did about the sponge, I could not think you meant any harm to me.\"\n\nTooke could not remember anything about a sponge; and when he was told,\nhe thought nothing of it.  He went on--\n\n\"Do you think you shall never tell anybody, as long as you live, who\npulled you first?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Hugh, \"unless I tell it in my sleep; and that is not\nlikely, for I never think about it in the daytime,--or scarcely ever;\nand when I can run about again, I dare say I shall never think of it at\nall.\"\n\n\"But will you ever run about?\"\n\n\"O yes!  Finely, you will see.  I shall begin first with a little\nstick-leg, very light.  Mother is going to send some for me to try.\nWhen I am a man, I shall have one that will look like a real foot; but\nthat will not be so light as the one you will see me with after the\nholidays.  But you do not half know what I can do now, with my crutches.\nHere, I will show you.\"\n\nAs he flourished about, and played antics, Agnes heard the pit-pat of\nhis crutches, and she thought she might as well have been there, if they\nhad told all their secrets, and had got to play.  But the noise did not\nlast long, for Hugh's performances did not make Tooke very merry; and\nthe boys sat down quietly again.\n\n\"Now, I'll tell you what,\" said Tooke.  \"I am a bigger and stronger boy\nthan you, without considering this accident I'll take care of you all\nthe time you are at Crofton: and always afterwards, if I can.  Mind you\nthat.  If anybody teases you, you call me,--that's all.  Say you will.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Hugh, \"I had rather take care of myself.  I had rather make\nno difference between you and everybody else.\"\n\n\"There now!  You don't forgive me, after all.\"\n\n\"I do,--upon my word, I do.  But why should I make any difference\nbetween you and the rest, when you did not mean me any harm,--any more\nthan they?  Besides, it might make people suspect.\"\n\n\"Well, let them.  Sometimes I wish,\" continued Tooke, twisting himself\nabout in the uneasiness of his mind, \"sometimes I wish that everybody\nknew now.  They say murderers cannot keep their secret.  They are sure\nto tell, when they cannot bear it any longer.\"\n\n\"That is because of their consciences,\" said Hugh.  \"But you are not\nguilty of anything, you know.  I am sure I can keep a secret easily\nenough, when I am not to blame in it.\"\n\n\"Yes!  You have shown that.  But--\"\n\n\"Come!  Don't let us talk any more about that--only just this.  Has\nanybody accused you?  Because I must know,--I must be on my guard.\"\n\n\"Nobody has said a word, because my father put us all upon honour never\nto mention it: but I always feel as if all their eyes were upon me all\nday,--and sometimes in the night.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  I don't believe anybody has pitched on you particularly.\nAnd when school opens again, all their eyes will be on me, to see how I\nmanage.  But I don't mean to mind that.  Anybody may stare that likes.\"\n\nHugh sighed, however, after saying this; and Tooke was silent.  At\nlength he declared,--\n\n\"Whatever you say against it, I shall always take your part: and you\nhave only to ask me, and I will always run anywhere, and do anything for\nyou.  Mind you that.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hugh.  \"Now tell me about the new usher; for I dare\nsay you know more than the other boys do.  Holt and I shall be under him\naltogether, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes: and you will be well off, by what I hear.  He is as little like\nMr Carnaby as need be.\"\n\nAll the rest of the afternoon was taken up with stories of Mr Carnaby\nand other ushers, so that the boys were surprised when the maid came to\ntell them that tea was ready.\n\nAgnes was making tea.  Hugh was so eager to repeat to his uncle some of\nthe good stories that he had just heard, that he did not observe, as his\naunt did, how red his sister's fingers were, and how she shivered still.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs Shaw, \"you have let these boys keep you away from\nthe fire.\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt; never mind!  I shall be warm enough presently.\"\n\n\"But you should not allow it, Agnes.  How are they ever to learn\nmanners, if they are not made to give way to young ladies while they are\nyoung?  Boys are sure to be rude enough, at any rate.  Their sisters\nshould know better than to spoil them.\"\n\nWhile poor Agnes' hardships were ending with a lecture, Hugh was\nchattering away, not at all aware that he had treated his sister much as\nPhil had treated him on his going to Crofton.  If any one had told him\nthat he was tyrannical, he would have been as much surprised as he had\nbeen at Phil's tyranny over him.  He did not know indeed that his sister\nhad been in the cold and in the dark; but he might have felt that he had\nused her with a roughness which is more painful to a loving heart than\ncold and darkness are to the body.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. HOLT AND HIS DIGNITY.\n\nThere was no reason now why Hugh should not go to church.  He and his\ncrutches went between his uncle and aunt in the gig one way, and between\nhis uncle and Agnes home again; and he could walk up the aisle quite\nwell.  He had been pleased at the idea of attending church again, and\nhad never thought of the pain of being stared at for his lameness.  This\npain came upon him as he entered the church; and as he went up towards\nhis uncle's pew, and saw the crowd of Crofton boys all looking at him,\nand some of the poor people turning their heads as he passed, to observe\nhow he got on, he felt covered with confusion, and wished that he had\nwaited one more Sunday, when the Crofton boys would have been all gone,\nand there would have been fewer eyes to mark his infirmity.  But better\nthoughts soon arose, and made him ashamed of his false shame; and before\nthe service was over, he felt how trifling is any misfortune while we\nare friends with God, in comparison with the least wrong-doing which\nsets us at a distance from him.  He could not but feel after church that\nhe had rather, a thousand times, be as he was than be poor Lamb, who\nslunk away from him, and hid himself behind the other boys,--his mind\nsore and troubled, no doubt, about his debt, and his cheating\ntransaction, so long ago.  Hugh asked some of the boys to bring up Lamb,\nto shake hands before parting for the holidays; but he would not come,\nand wriggled himself out of sight.  Then Hugh recollected that he could\nforgive Lamb as well without Lamb's knowing it; and he let him alone.\n\nThen there was Holt.  He and Holt had parted on uneasy terms; and Holt\nnow looked shy and uncomfortable.  Hugh beckoned to him, and asked him\nwhether he was really to remain at Crofton all the holidays.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Holt.  \"I am the only one not going home, unless you are to\nstay hereabouts.  Even Tooke is to be at his uncle's in London.  When do\nyou go home?\"\n\n\"Not quite yet;--not at the beginning of the holidays,\" said Hugh,\nhesitating, and looking up at his uncle.  For, in truth, he did not know\nexactly what was planned for him, and had been afraid to ask.\n\nHis uncle said, very kindly, that he was not going to part with Hugh\ntill school opened again.  He would recover his full strength better in\nthe country; and his aunt had promised his parents that he should be a\nstout boy again by the time he was wanted at Crofton.\n\nThis was what Hugh had dreaded to hear; and when he thought that he\nshould not see his parents, nor little Harry, for so many months, his\nheart sank.  But he was still in the church; and perhaps the place\nhelped him to remember his mother's expectation that he should not fail,\nand his own resolution to bear cheerfully whatever troubles his\nmisfortune brought upon him, from the greatest to the least.  So when he\nheard his uncle saying to Holt that he should ask Mr Tooke to let him\ncome and spend two or three weeks at his house, he said so heartily that\nhe hoped Holt would come, that Holt felt that whatever discontent had\nbeen between them was forgiven and forgotten.\n\nPhil went home, of course; and when Holt arrived at Mr Shaw's, Agnes\nalso returned to London, that she might see something of Phil.  Then the\ntwo boys were glad to be together, though Hugh would rather have had his\ndear friend Dale for a companion; and Holt knew that this was the case.\nYet Hugh saw, and was glad to see, that Holt was improved.  He had\nplucked up some spirit, and was more like other lads, though still, by\nhis own account, too much like a timid, helpless foreigner among the\nrough Crofton boys.\n\nAll the boys had some lessons to prepare in the holidays.  Every one who\nhad ever written a theme had a theme to write now.  Every boy who could\nconstrue had a good piece of Latin to prepare; and all had either Latin\nor English verses to learn by heart.  Mrs Shaw made a point of her\nyoung visitors sitting down every morning after breakfast to their\nbusiness; and Hugh was anxious to spare no pains, this time, about his\ntheme, that, if he was to be praised, he might deserve it.  He saw that\nHolt could not fix his attention well, either upon work or play; and one\nmorning, when Hugh was pondering how, without knowing anything of\nhistory, he should find a modern example to match well with his ancient\none (which he had picked up by chance), Holt burst upon his meditation\nwith--\n\n\"I have a good mind to tell you what has been upon my mind this ever so\nlong.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Hugh.  \"I must find my example first.\"\n\nNo example could he find, to his satisfaction, this day.  He gave it up\ntill to-morrow, and then asked Holt what was on his mind.  But Holt now\ndrew back, and did not think he could tell.  This made Hugh press; and\nHugh's pressing looked like sympathy, and gave Holt courage: so that the\nthing came out at last.  Holt was very miserable, for he was deep in\ndebt, and the boys never let him alone about it; and he did not see how\nhe should ever pay, as nobody was likely to give him any money.\n\n\"Remember, it is only sixpence that you owe me--not a shilling,\" said\nHugh.\n\nHolt sighed.  Perhaps he had hoped that Hugh would excuse him\naltogether.  He explained that this sixpence was not all, nor the chief\npart.  He told that, when the whole school was on the heath, one\nSaturday, they had seen a balloon rising at a distance, and some boys\nbegan betting about what direction it would move in when it ceased to\nrise perpendicularly.  The betting spread till the boys told him he must\nbet, or he would be the only one left out, and would look like a shabby\nfellow.\n\n\"And you did?\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"How silly!\"\n\n\"You would have done it, if you had been there.\"\n\n\"No: I should not.\"\n\n\"Yes, you would.  Or, if you had not, it would have been because of--I\nknow what.\"\n\n\"Because of what, pray?\"\n\n\"Because of something the boys say about you.  They say you are very\nfond of money.\"\n\n\"I!  Fond of money!  I declare I never heard of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Well, you know you made a great fuss about that half-crown.\"\n\n\"As if it was about the money!\" cried Hugh.  \"I should not have cared a\nbit if my uncle had asked me for it back again the next day.  It was the\nbeing cheated.  That was the thing.  What a shame--\"\n\n\"By-the-by, did your uncle ever ask what you did with that half-crown?\"\n\n\"No; but he will next week, at the January fair.  He will be sure to ask\nthen.  What a shame of the boys to say so, when I forgave--\"\n\nHe remembered, just in time, that he had better not boast, or speak\naloud, of having forgiven Lamb his debt in secret.  He resolved that he\nwould not say another word, but let the boys see that he did not care\nfor money for its own sake.  They were all wrong, but he would be above\nnoticing it; and, besides, he really had been very anxious about his\nhalf-crown, and they had only mistaken the reason.\n\n\"How much did you bet on the balloon?\" he inquired of Holt.\n\n\"A shilling; and I lost.\"\n\n\"Then you owe eighteen-pence.\"\n\n\"But that is not all.  I borrowed a shilling of Meredith to pay\nschool-fines--\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Chiefly for leaving my books about.  Meredith says I promised to pay\nhim before the holidays; but I am sure I never did.  He twitted me about\nit, so that I declare I would have fought him, if I could have paid him\nfirst.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"Why, Holt, what a different fellow you\nare!  You never used to talk of fighting.\"\n\n\"But this fellow Meredith plagued me so!  If it had not been for that\nshilling, I would have knocked him down.  Well, here is half-a-crown\naltogether; and how am I ever to get half-a-crown?\"\n\n\"Cannot you ask your uncle?\"\n\n\"No; you know I can't.  You know he complains about having to pay the\nbills for me before my father can send the money from India.\"\n\n\"I suppose it would take too long to ask your father.  Yes; of course it\nwould.  There would be another holidays before you could have an answer;\nand almost another still.  I wonder what uncle Shaw would say.  He is\nvery kind always, but it might set him asking--\"\n\n\"And what should I do, staying here, if he should be angry and refuse?\nWhat should I do every day at dinner?\"\n\n\"I know what I would do?\" said Hugh, decidedly.  \"I would tell Mr Tooke\nall about it, and ask him for half-a-crown.\"\n\n\"Mr Tooke?  Oh!  I dare not.\"\n\n\"I dare,--in holiday-time.  He is your master,--next to being your\nfather, while your father is so far away.  You had better ask Mr Tooke,\nto be sure.\"\n\n\"What go to Crofton, and speak to him?  I really want not to be a\ncoward,--but I never could go and tell him.\"\n\n\"Write him a letter, then.  Yes: that is the way.  Write a letter, and I\nwill get one of my uncle's men to carry it, and wait for an answer: and\nthen you will not be long in suspense, at any rate.\"\n\n\"I wish I dare!\"\n\nHolt was not long in passing from wishing to daring.  He wrote a letter,\nwhich Hugh thought would do, though he rather wished Holt had not\nmentioned him as instigating the act.  This was the letter:\n\n  \"The Mill, _January 6th_.\n\n  \"Dear Sir,\n\n  \"I am very unhappy; and Proctor thinks I had better tell you what is\n  upon my mind.  I owe some money, and I do not see how I can ever pay\n  it, unless you will help me.  You know I have owed Proctor sixpence\n  for ginger-beer, this long time; and as Lamb has never paid him his\n  share, Proctor cannot excuse me this debt.  Then I owe a boy a\n  shilling, lent me for school-fines; and he never lets me alone about\n  it.  Then I was led into betting a shilling on a balloon, and I lost;\n  and so I owe half-a-crown.  If you would lend me that sum, sir, I\n  shall be obliged to you for ever, and I shall never forget it.\n\n  \"Yours respectfully,\n\n  \"Thomas Holt.\"\n\nMr Shaw's man George carried the letter; but he brought back neither\nletter nor money: only a message that Mr Tooke would call; which put\nHolt into a great fright, and made Hugh rather uneasy.\n\nThere was no occasion for this, however.  Mr Tooke came alone into the\nroom where the boys were sitting; and neither Mr nor Mrs Shaw appeared\nduring the whole time of his visit: a thing which was rather odd, but\nwhich the boys were very glad of.  When Mr Tooke had told them a little\nof some new boys expected after the holidays, he said:\n\n\"Well, now, Holt, let us see what can be done about your affairs.\"\n\nHolt looked uneasy; for it seemed as if Mr Tooke was not going to lend\nhim the money,--or to give it, which was what he had hoped, while using\nthe word \"lend.\"\n\n\"I am glad you asked me,\" continued Mr Tooke; \"for people, whether they\nbe men or boys, can usually retrieve their affairs when they have\nresolution to face their difficulties.  There is no occasion to say\nanything about how you got into debt.  We must consider how you are to\nget out of it.\"\n\n\"That is very kind indeed!\" exclaimed Holt.\n\n\"As to my lending you half-a-crown,\" continued Mr Tooke, \"that would\nnot be helping you out of debt; for if you had had any prospect of being\nable to pay half-a-crown, you would not have needed to apply to me at\nall.\"\n\nHolt sighed.  Mr Tooke went on.\n\n\"I cannot give you the money.  I have less to give away than I should\nlike to have, for the sake of the poor people round us.  I cannot pay\nfor a bet and school-fines while the children of our neighbours want\nclothes and fire.\"\n\n\"No, sir, certainly,\" said both the boys.\n\n\"What do people do, all the world over, when they want money?\" asked Mr\nTooke.  Holt looked puzzled.  Hugh smiled.  Holt was hesitating whether\nto guess that they put into the lottery, or dig for treasure, or borrow\nfrom their friends, or what.  Having always till lately lived in India,\nwhere Europeans are rather lazy, and life altogether is very languid, he\ndid not see, as Hugh did, what Mr Tooke could mean.\n\n\"When men come begging to our doors,\" said Mr Tooke, \"what is the first\nquestion we ask them?\"\n\nHolt still looked puzzled, and Hugh laughed, saying,--\n\n\"Why, Holt, you must know very well.  We ask them whether they cannot\nget work.\"\n\n\"Work!\" cried Holt.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Tooke.  \"The fathers and uncles of both of you work for\nwhat money they have; and so do I; and so does every man among our\nneighbours who is satisfied with his condition.  As far as I see, you\nmust get the money you want in the same way.\"\n\n\"Work!\" exclaimed Holt again.\n\n\"How is he to get work?\" asked Hugh.\n\n\"That is where I hope to assist him,\" replied Mr Tooke.  \"Are you\nwilling to earn your half-crown, Holt?\"\n\n\"I don't know how, sir.\"\n\n\"Widow Murray thinks she should have a better chance for a new lodger if\nher little parlour was fresh papered; but she is too rheumatic to do it\nherself, and cannot afford to engage a workman.  If you like to try,\nunder her directions, I will pay you as your work deserves.\"\n\n\"But, sir, I never papered a room in my life.\"\n\n\"No more had the best paper-hanger in London when he first tried.  But\nif you do not like that work, what do you think of doing some writing\nfor me?  Our tables of rules are dirty.  If you will make good copies of\nour rules for all the rooms in which they hang, in the course of the\nholidays, I will pay you half-a-crown.  But the copies must be quite\ncorrect, and the writing good.  I can offer you one other choice.  Our\nschool library wants looking to.  If you will put fresh paper covers to\nall the books that want covering, write the titles on the backs, compare\nthe whole with the catalogue, and arrange them properly on the shelves,\nI will pay you half-a-crown.\"\n\nHolt's pleasure in the prospect of being out of debt was swallowed up in\nthe anxiety of undertaking anything so new to him as work out of school.\nHugh hurried him on to a decision.\n\n\"Do choose the papering,\" urged Hugh.  \"I can help you in that, I do\nbelieve.  I can walk that little way, to widow Murray's; and I can paste\nthe paper.  Widow Murray will show you how to do it; and it is very\neasy, if you once learn to join the pattern.  I found that, when I\nhelped to paper the nursery closet at home.\"\n\n\"It is an easy pattern to join,\" said Mr Tooke.\n\n\"There now!  And that is the chief thing.  If you do the library books,\nI cannot help you, you know.  And remember, you will have two miles to\nwalk each way; four miles a-day in addition to the work.\"\n\n\"He can sleep at Crofton, if he likes,\" said Mr Tooke.\n\n\"That would be a queer way of staying at uncle Shaw's,\" observed Hugh.\n\n\"Then there is copying the rules,\" said Holt.  \"I might do that here;\nand you might help me, if you liked.\"\n\n\"Dull work!\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"Think of copying the same rules three or\nfour times over!  And then, if you make mistakes, if you do not write\nclearly, where is your half-crown?  I don't mean that I would not help\nyou, but it would be the dullest work of all.\"\n\nMr Tooke sat patiently waiting till Holt had made up his mind.  He\nperceived something that never entered Hugh's mind: that Holt's pride\nwas hurt at the notion of doing workman's work.  He wrote on a slip of\npaper these few words, and pushed them across the table to Holt, with a\nsmile:--\n\n\"No debtor's hands are clean, however white they be: Who digs and pays\nhis way--the true gentleman is he.\"\n\nHolt coloured as he read, and immediately said that he chose the\npapering job.  Mr Tooke rose, tossed the slip of paper into the fire,\nbuttoned up his coat, and said that he should let widow Murray know that\na workman would wait upon her the next morning, and that she must have\nher paste and brushes and scissors ready.\n\n\"And a pair of steps,\" said Hugh, with a sigh.\n\n\"Steps, of course,\" replied Mr Tooke.  \"You will think it a pretty\npaper, I am sure.\"\n\n\"But, sir, she must quite understand that she is not at all obliged to\nus,--that is, to me,\" said Holt.\n\n\"Certainly.  You will tell her so yourself, of course.\"\n\nHere again Holt's pride was hurt; but the thought of being out of\nMeredith's power sustained him.\n\nWhen Mr Tooke was gone, Hugh said to his companion,--\n\n\"I do not want you to tell me what Mr Tooke wrote on that paper that he\nburned.  I only want to know whether he asked you to choose so as to\nindulge me.\"\n\n\"You!  O no!  There was not a word about you.\"\n\n\"O!  Very well!\" replied Hugh, not sure whether he was pleased or not.\n\nThe next morning was so fine that there was no difficulty about Hugh's\nwalking the short distance to the widow Murray's; and there, for three\nmornings, did the boys work diligently, till the room was papered, and\ntwo cupboards into the bargain.  Holt liked it very well, except for two\nthings:--that Hugh was sure he could have done some difficult corners\nbetter than Holt had done them, if he could but have stood upon the\nsteps; and that widow Murray did so persist in thanking him, that he had\nto tell her several times over that she was not obliged to him at all,\nbecause he was to be paid for the job.\n\nMr Tooke came to see the work when it was done, and returned to Mr\nShaw's with the boys, in order to pay Holt his half-crown immediately,\nand yet so that the widow should not see.  Hugh's eye followed Mr\nTooke's hand as it went a second time into his pocket; and he was\nconscious of some sort of hope that he might be paid something too.\nWhen no more silver came forth, he felt aware that he ought not to have\ndreamed of any reward for the help he had freely offered to his\ncompanion: and he asked himself whether his schoolfellows were\naltogether wrong in thinking him too fond of money; and whether he was\naltogether right in having said that it was justice that he cared for,\nand not money, when he had pressed his debtor hard.  However this might\nbe, he was very glad to receive his sixpence from Holt.  As he put it in\nhis inner pocket, he observed that this would be all the money he should\nhave in the world when he should have spent his five shillings in\nfairings for home.\n\nHolt made no answer.  He had nothing to spend in the fair; still less,\nanything left over.  But he remembered that he was out of debt,--that\nMeredith, would twit him no more,--and he began to whistle, so\nlight-hearted, that no amount of money could have made him happier.  He\nonly left off whistling to thank Hugh earnestly for having persuaded him\nto open his heart to Mr Tooke.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. TRIPPING.\n\nWhen the day came for returning to Crofton, Hugh would have left his\ncrutches behind at his uncle's, so much did he prefer walking with the\nlittle light stick-leg he had been practising with for a fortnight.  But\nhis aunt shook her head at this, and ordered the crutches into the gig.\nHe still walked slowly and cautiously, and soon grew tired: and she\nthought he might find it a relief at times to hop about on his crutches.\nThey were hidden under the bed, however, immediately on his arrival; so\nanxious was Hugh to make the least of his lameness, and look as like\nother boys as possible, both for Tooke's sake and his own.  When the\nboys had been all assembled for one day, and everybody had seen how\nlittle Proctor could walk, the subject seemed to be dropped, and nothing\nwas talked of but the new usher.  So Hugh said to himself; and he really\nthought that he had fully taken his place again as a Crofton boy, and\nthat he should be let off all notice of his infirmity henceforth, and\nall trials from it, except such as no one but himself need know of.  He\nwas even not quite sure whether he should not be a gainer by it on the\nwhole.  He remembered Tooke's assurances of protection and friendship;\nhe found Phil very kind and watchful; and Mrs Watson told him privately\nthat he was to be free of the orchard.  She showed him the little door\nthrough which he might enter at any time, alone, or with one companion.\nHere he might read, or talk, and get out of sight of play that he could\nnot share.  The privilege was to be continued as long as no mischief was\ndone to anything within the orchard.  The prospect of the hours, the\nquiet hours, the bright hours that he should spend here alone with Dale,\ndelighted Hugh: and when he told Dale, Dale liked the prospect too; and\nthey went together, at the earliest opportunity, to survey their new\ndomain, and plan where they would sit in spring, and how they would lie\non the grass in summer, and be closer and closer friends for ever.\n\nHolt was encouraged to hope that he should have his turn sometimes; but\nhe saw that, though Hugh cared more for him than before the holidays, he\nyet loved Dale the best.\n\nWhile Hugh was still in spirits at the thought that his worst trials\nwere over, and the pleasure of his indulgences to come, he felt very\ncomplacent; and he thought he would gratify himself with one more\nreading of the theme which he had written in the holidays,--the theme\nwhich he really believed Mr Tooke might fairly praise,--so great had\nbeen the pains he had taken with the composition, and so neatly was it\nwritten out.  He searched for it in vain among his books and in his\nportfolio.  Then he got leave to go up to his room, and turn over all\nhis clothes.  He did so in vain; and at last he remembered that it was\nfar indeed out of his reach,--in the drawer of his aunt's work-table,\nwhere it had lain ever since she had asked him for it, to read to a lady\nwho had visited her.\n\nThe themes would certainly be called for the first thing on Mr Tooke's\nappearance in school, at nine the next morning.  The duties of the early\nmorning would leave no one any time to run to Mr Shaw's then.  If\nanybody went, it must be now.  The first day was one of little\nregularity; it was only just beginning so grow dusk; any willing boy\nmight be back before supper; and there was no doubt that leave would be\ngiven on such an occasion.  So Hugh made his way to the playground as\nfast as possible, and told his trouble to his best friends there,--to\nPhil, and Holt, and Dale, and as many as happened to be within hearing.\n\n\"Never mind your theme!\" said Phil.  \"Nobody expected you to do one; and\nyou have only to say that you left it behind you.\"\n\n\"It is not that,\" said Hugh.  \"I must show up my theme.\"\n\n\"You can't, you know, if you have it not to show,\" said two or three,\nwho thought this settled the matter.\n\n\"But it is there: it is at my uncle's, if any one would go for it,\" said\nHugh, beginning to be agitated.\n\n\"Go for it!\" exclaimed Phil.  \"What, in the dark,--this freezing\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"It is not near dark; it will not be dark this hour.  Anybody might run\nthere and back before supper.\"\n\nHe looked at Dale; but Dale looked another way.  For a moment he thought\nof Tooke's permission to appeal to him when he wanted a friend: but\nTooke was not within hearing; and he dismissed the thought of pointing\nout Tooke to anybody's notice.  He turned away as Phil repeated that it\nwas quite certain that there would be no bad consequences from his being\nunprovided with a theme, which was not one of his regular lessons.\n\nPhil was not quite easy, however: nor were the others who heard; and in\na minute they looked round for Hugh.  He was leaning his face upon his\narms, against the orchard-wall; and when, with gentle force, they pulled\nhim away, they saw that his face was bathed in tears.  He sobbed out,--\n\n\"I took such pains with that theme,--all the holidays!  And I can't go\nfor it myself.\"\n\nThere were loud exclamations from many against Phil, against one\nanother, and against themselves; and now everybody was eager to go.\nPhil stopped all who had started off, saying that it was his business;\nand the next moment, Phil was at Mr Tooke's study-door, asking leave of\nabsence till supper.\n\n\"Little Holt has been beforehand with you,\" said Mr Tooke.  \"I refused\nhim, however, as he is not so fit as you to be out after dark.  Off with\nyou!\"\n\nBefore Phil returned, it struck Hugh that he had been very selfish; and\nthat it was not a good way of bearing his trial to impose on any one a\nwalk of four miles, to repair a piece of carelessness of his own.\nNobody blamed him; but he did not like to look in the faces round him,\nto see what people thought.  When Phil returned, fresh and hungry from\nthe frosty air, and threw down the paper, saying,--\n\n\"There is your theme, and my aunt is very sorry,\" Hugh said,--\n\n\"Oh!  Phil, and I am so sorry too!  I hope you are not very tired.\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" replied Phil.  \"There is your theme.\"\n\nAnd with this Hugh was obliged to be satisfied; but it left him\nexceedingly uncomfortable--sorry for Phil--disappointed in Dale--and\nmuch more disappointed in himself.  The thought of what Holt had wished\nto do was the only pleasant part of it; and Hugh worked beside Holt, and\ntalked with him all the evening.\n\nHugh felt, the next morning, as if he was never to have any pleasure\nfrom his themes, though they were the lesson he did best.  This one was\npraised, quite as much as the former one: and he did not this time tell\nanybody what Mr Tooke had said about it: but the pleasure was spoiled\nby the recollection that his brother had run four miles on account of\nit, and that he himself must have appeared to others more selfish than\nhe thought them.  He burned his theme, that he might the more easily\nforget all about it; and the moment after he had done so, Phil said he\nshould have kept it, as other boys did theirs, for his parents to see.\n\nMr Crabbe was just such a master as it was good for the little boys to\nbe under.  He did not punish capriciously, nor terrify them by anything\nworse than his strictness.  Very strict he was; and he thus caused them\nsome fear every day: for Holt was backward, and not very clever: and\nHugh was still much less able to learn than most other boys.  But all\nfelt that Mr Crabbe was not unreasonable, and they always knew exactly\nhow much to be afraid of.  Whether he had inquired, or been told, the\nstory of Hugh's lameness, they did not know.  He said nothing about it,\nexcept just asking Hugh whether it tired him to stand up in class,\nsaying that he might sit at the top or bottom of the class, instead of\ntaking places, if he chose.  Hugh did find it rather fatiguing at first:\nbut he did not like to take advantage of Mr Crabbe's offer, because it\nso happened that he was almost always at the bottom of his classes: and\nto have withdrawn from the contest would have looked like a trick to\nhide the shame, and might have caused him to be set down as a dunce who\nnever could rise.  He thanked Mr Crabbe, and said that if he should\nrise in his classes, and keep a good place for some time, he thought he\nshould be glad to sit, instead of standing; but meantime he had rather\nbe tired.  Then the feeling of fatigue went off before he rose, or saw\nany chance of rising.\n\nThis inability to do his lessons so well as other boys was a deep and\nlasting grief to Hugh.  Though he had in reality improved much since he\ncame to Crofton, and was now and then cheered by some proof of this, his\ngeneral inferiority in this respect was such as to mortify him every day\nof his life, and sometimes to throw him almost into despair.  He saw\nthat everybody pitied him for the loss of his foot, but not for this\nother trouble, while he felt this to be rather the worst of the two; and\nall the more because he was not sure himself whether or not he could\nhelp it, as every one else seemed certain that he might.  When he said\nhis prayer in his bed, he earnestly entreated that he might be able to\nbear the one trouble, and be delivered from the other; and when, as the\nspring came on, he was found by one friend or another lying on the grass\nwith his face hidden, he was often praying with tears for help in doing\nthis duty, when he was thought to be grieving that he could not play at\nleaping or foot-ball, like other boys.  And yet, the very next evening,\nwhen the whole school were busy over their books, and there was nothing\nto interfere with his work, he would pore over his lesson without taking\nin half the sense, while his fancy was straying everywhere but where it\nought;--perhaps to little Harry, or the Temple Gardens at home, or to\nCape Horn, or Japan--some way farther off still.  It did not often\nhappen now, as formerly, that he forgot before morning a lesson well\nlearned over-night.  He was aware that now everything depended on\nwhether he was once sure of his lesson; but the difficulty was in once\nbeing sure of it.\n\nFinding Phil's kindness continue through the first weeks and months of\nthe half-year, Hugh took courage at last to open his mind pretty freely\nto his brother, offering to do anything in the world for Phil, if he\nwould only hear him his lessons every evening till he could say them\nperfect.  Phil was going to plead that he had no time, when Hugh popped\nout--\n\n\"The thing is that it does not help me to say them to just anybody.\nSaying them to somebody that I am afraid of is what I want.\"\n\n\"Why, you are not afraid of me?\" said Phil.  \"Yes I am--rather.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Oh, because you are older;--and you are so much more of a Crofton boy\nthan I am--and you are very strict--and altogether--\"\n\n\"Yes, you will find me pretty strict, I can tell you,\" said Phil, unable\nto restrain a complacent smile on finding that somebody was afraid of\nhim.  \"Well, we must see what we can do.  I will hear you to-night, at\nany rate.\"\n\nBetween his feeling of kindness and the gratification of his vanity,\nPhil found himself able to hear his brother's lessons every evening.  He\nwas certainly very strict, and was not sparing of such pushes, joggings,\nand ridicule as were necessary to keep Hugh up to his work.  These were\nvery provoking sometimes; but Hugh tried to bear them for the sake of\nthe gain.  Whenever Phil would condescend to explain, in fresh words,\nthe sense of what Hugh had to learn, he saved trouble to both, and the\nlesson went off quickly and easily: but sometimes he would not explain\nanything, and soon went away in impatience, leaving Hugh in the midst of\nhis perplexities.  There was a chance, on such occasions, that Firth\nmight be at leisure, or Dale able to help: so that, one way and another,\nHugh found his affairs improving as the spring advanced; and he began to\nlose his anxiety, and to gain credit with the usher.  He also now and\nthen won a place in his classes.\n\nTowards the end of May, when the trees were full of leaf, and the\nevenings sunny, and the open air delicious, quite up to bedtime, Phil\nbecame persuaded, very suddenly, that Hugh could get on by himself now;\nthat it was not fair that he should be helped; and that it was even\nhurtful to him to rely on any one but himself.  If Phil had acted\ngradually upon this conviction, withdrawing his help by degrees, it\nmight have been all very well: but he refused at once and decidedly to\nhave anything more to do with Hugh's lessons, as he was quite old and\nforward enough now to do them by himself.  This announcement threw his\nbrother into a state of consternation not at all favourable to learning;\nand the next morning Hugh made several blunders.  He did the same every\nday that week; was every afternoon detained from play to learn his\nlessons again; and on the Saturday morning (repetition day) he lost all\nthe places he had gained, and left off at the bottom of every class.\n\nWhat could Mr Crabbe suppose but that a sudden fit of idleness was the\ncause of this falling back?  It appeared so to him, and to the whole\nschool; and poor Hugh felt as if there was scorn in every eye that\nlooked upon his disgrace.  He thought there could not be a boy in the\nschool who did not see or hear that he was at the bottom of every class.\n\nMr Crabbe always desired to be just: and he now gave Hugh the\nopportunity of explaining, if he had anything to say.  He remained in\nthe school-room after the boys had left it, and asked Hugh a question or\ntwo.  But Hugh sobbed and cried so bitterly that he could not speak so\nas to be understood; and he did not wish to explain, feeling that he was\nmuch obliged to Phil for his former help, and that he ought not to\ncomplain to any master of its being now withdrawn.  So Mr Crabbe could\nonly hope that next week would show a great difference, and advise him\nto go out with the rest this afternoon, to refresh himself for a new\neffort.\n\nHugh did not know whether he had not rather have been desired to stay at\nhome than go out among so many who considered him disgraced.  It really\nwas hard (though Holt stood by him, and Dale was his companion as usual)\nto bear the glances he saw, and the words that came to his ear.  Some\nboys looked to see how red his eyes were: some were surprised to see him\nabroad, and hinted a favouritism because he was not shut up in the\nschool-room.  Some asked whether he could say his alphabet yet; and\nothers whether he could spell \"dunce.\"  The most cruel thing of all was\nto see Tooke in particularly high spirits.  He kept away from Hugh; but\nHugh's eye followed him from afar, and saw that he capered and laughed,\nand was gayer than at any time this half-year.  Hugh saw into his heart\n(or thought he did) as plain as he saw to the bottom of the clear stream\nin the meadows, to which they were bound for their afternoon's sport.\n\n\"I know what Tooke is feeling,\" thought he.  \"He is pleased to see me\nlowered, as long as it is not his doing.  He is sorry to see me suffer\nby my lameness; because that hurts his conscience: but he is pleased to\nsee me wrong and disgraced, because that relieves him of the feeling of\nbeing obliged to me.  If I were now to put him in mind of his promise,\nto stand by me, and protect me--I declare I will--it will stop his\nwicked joy--it will make him remember his duty.\"\n\nDale wondered to see Hugh start off, as fast as he could go, to overtake\nthe foremost boys, who were just entering the meadow, and spreading\nthemselves over it.  Tooke could, alas!  Like everybody else, go faster\nthan Hugh; and there was no catching him, though he did not seem to see\nthat anybody wanted him.  Neither could he be made to hear, though Hugh\ncalled him as loud as he could shout.  Holt was so sorry to see Hugh hot\nand agitated, that he made no objection to going after Tooke, though he\nwas pretty sure Tooke would be angry with him.  Holt could run as fast\nas anybody, and he soon caught the boy he was pursuing, and told him\nthat little Proctor wanted him very much indeed, that very moment.\nTooke sent him about his business, saying that he could not come; and\nthen immediately proposed brook-leaping for their sport, leading the way\nhimself over a place so wide that no lesser boy, however nimble, could\nfollow.  Holt came running back, shaking his head, and showing that his\nerrand was in vain.  Tooke was so full of play that he could think of\nnothing else; which was a shame.\n\n\"Ah!  And you little know,\" thought Hugh, \"how deep a shame it is.\"\n\nWith a swelling heart he turned away, and went towards the bank of the\nbroader stream which ran through the meadows.  Dale was with him in a\nmoment,--very sorry for him, because everybody else was at\nbrook-leaping,--the sport that Hugh had loved so well last autumn.  Dale\npassed his arm round Hugh's neck, and asked where they should sit and\ntell stories,--where they could best hide themselves, so that nobody\nshould come and tease them.  Hugh wished to thank his friend for this;\nbut he could not speak directly.  They found a pleasant place among the\nflowering reeds on the bank, where they thought nobody would see them;\nand having given Holt to understand that they did not want him, they\nsettled themselves for their favourite amusement of story-telling.\n\nBut Hugh's heart was too full and too sick for even his favourite\namusement; and Dale was perhaps too sorry for him to be the most\njudicious companion he could have at such a time.  Dale agreed that the\nboys were hard and careless; and he added that it was particularly\nshameful to bring up a boy's other faults when he was in disgrace for\none.  In the warmth of his zeal, he told how one boy had been laughing\nat Hugh's conceit about his themes, when he had shown to-day that he\ncould not go half through his syntax; and how he had heard another say\nthat all that did not signify half so much as his being mean about\nmoney.  Between Hugh's eagerness to hear, and Dale's sympathy, five\nminutes were not over before Hugh had heard every charge that could be\nbrought against his character, and knew that they were all circulating\nthis very afternoon.  In his agony of mind he declared that everybody at\nCrofton hated him,--that he could never hold up his head there,--that he\nwould ask to be sent home by the coach, and never come near Crofton\nagain.\n\nDale now began to be frightened, and wished he had not said so much.  He\ntried to make light of it; but Hugh seemed disposed to do something\ndecided;--to go to his uncle Shaw's at least, if he could not get home.\nDale earnestly protested, against any such idea, and put him in mind how\nhe was respected by everybody for his bravery about the loss of his\nfoot.\n\n\"Respected?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" cried Hugh.  \"They none of them remember: they don't\ncare a bit about it.\"\n\nDale was sure they did.\n\n\"I tell you they don't.  I know they don't.  I know it for certain; and\nI will tell you how I know.  There is the very boy that did it,--the\nvery boy that pulled me from the wall--O!  If you knew who it was, you\n_would_ say it was a shame!\"\n\nDale involuntarily sat up, and looked back, over the top of the reeds,\nat the boys who were brook-leaping.\n\n\"Would you like to know who it was that did it, Dale?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you like to tell; but--And if he treats you ill, after the way\nyou used him, he cannot expect you should consider him so--Besides, I am\nyour best friend; and I always tell you everything!\"\n\n\"Yes, that you do.  And he has treated me so shamefully to-day!  And I\nhave nobody to speak to that knows.  You will promise never--never to\ntell anybody as long as you live.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Dale.\n\n\"And you won't tell anybody that I have told you.\"\n\n\"To be sure not.\"\n\n\"Well, then--\"\n\nHere there was a rustling among the reeds which startled them both, with\na sort of guilty feeling.  It was Holt, quite out of breath.\n\n\"I don't want to interrupt you,\" said he, \"and I know you wish I would\nnot come; but the others made me come.  The biggest boys lay that the\nsecond-size can't jump the brook at the willow-stump; and the\nsecond-size boys want Dale to try.  They made me come.  I could not help\nit.\"\n\nHugh looked at Dale, with eyes which said, as plainly as eyes could\nspeak, \"You will not go--you will not leave me at such a moment?\"\n\nBut Dale was not looking at his face, but at the clusters of boys beside\nthe brook.  He said--\n\n\"You will not mind my going, just for one leap.  It will hardly take a\nminute.  I shall not stay for a game.  But I must have just one leap.\"\n\nAnd he was off.  Holt looked after him, and then towards Hugh,\nhesitating whether to go or stay.  Hugh took no notice of him: so he\nwent slowly away, and Hugh was left alone.\n\nHe was in an extreme perturbation.  At the first moment, he was beyond\nmeasure hurt with Dale.  He did not think his best friend would have so\nreminded him of his infirmity, and of his being a restraint on his\ncompanions.  He did not think any friend could have left him at such a\nmoment.  Then it occurred to him,--\n\n\"What, then, am I?  If Dale was selfish, what was I?  I was just going\nto tell what would have pointed out Tooke to him for life.  I know as\nwell as can be that it was all accident his pulling me off the wall; and\nyet I was going to bring it up against him; and for the very reason why\nI should not,--because he has not behaved well to me.  I was just going\nto spoil the only good thing I ever did for anybody in my life.  But it\nis spoiled--completely spoiled.  I shall never be able to trust myself\nagain.  It is all by mere accident that it is not all over now.  If Holt\nhad not come that very instant, my secret would have been out, and I\ncould never have got it back again!  I could never have looked Tooke in\nthe face any more.  I don't know that I can now; for I am as wicked as\nif I had told.\"\n\nDale came back presently, fanning himself with his cap.  As he plunged\ninto the reeds, and threw himself down beside Hugh, he cried,--\n\n\"I did it!  I took the leap, and came off with my shoe-soles as dry as a\ncrust.  Ah!  They are wet now; but that is with another leap I took for\nsport.  I told you I should not be long gone.  Now for it!  Who did it?\"\n\n\"I am not going to tell you, Dale,--not now, nor ever.\"\n\n\"Why, that is too bad!  I am sure I stay beside you often enough, when\nthe others are playing: you need not grudge me this one leap,--when the\nboys sent for me, too.\"\n\n\"It is not that, Dale.  You are very kind always in staying beside me;\nand I do not wish that you should give up play for my sake half so much\nas you do.  But I was very, very wrong in meaning to tell you that\nsecret.  I should have been miserable by this time if I had.\"\n\n\"But you promised.  You must keep your promise.  What would all the boys\nsay, if I told them you had broken your promise?\"\n\n\"If they knew what it was about, they would despise me for ever meaning\nto tell--not for stopping short in time.  That was only accident,\nhowever.  But my secret is my own still.\"\n\nDale's curiosity was so strong that Hugh saw how dangerous it was to\nhave tantalised it.  He had to remind his friend of Mr Tooke's having\nput all the boys upon honour not to inquire on this subject.  This\nbrought Dale to himself; and he promised never again to urge Hugh, or\nencourage his speaking of the matter at all.  They then went to\nstory-telling; but it would not do to-day.  Hugh could not attend; and\nDale could not invent, while there was no sympathy in his hearer.  He\nwas presently released, for it struck Hugh that he should like to write\nto his mother this very afternoon.  His heart was heavy, and he wanted\nto tell her what was in it.  Mr Crabbe gave him leave to go home; and\nDale was in time for plenty more play.\n\nHugh had the great school-room all to himself; and as the window before\nhis desk was open, he had the pleasure of the fresh air, and the smell\nof the blossoms from the orchard, and the sound of the waving of the\ntall trees in the wind, and the cawing of the rooks as the trees waved.\nThese things all made him enjoy scribbling away to his mother, as well\nas finding his mind grow easier as he went on.  Besides, he had not to\ncare for the writing; for he had met Mr Tooke by the church, and had\ngot his leave to send his letter without anybody's looking at it, as he\nhad something very particular to say.  He wrote,--\n\n  \"Dear Mother,--\n\n  \"It is Saturday afternoon, and I have come home from the meadows\n  before the rest, to tell you something that has made me very uneasy.\n  If I had told anybody in the world who pulled me off the wall, it\n  should and would have been you,--that night after it happened: and I\n  am afraid I should have told you, if you had not prevented it: for I\n  find I am not to be trusted when I am talking with anybody I love very\n  much.  I have not told yet: but I should have told Dale if Holt had\n  not run up at the very moment.  It makes me very unhappy,--almost as\n  much as if I had let it out: for how do I know but that I may tell a\n  hundred times over in my life, if I could forget so soon?  I shall be\n  afraid of loving anybody very much, and talking with them alone, as\n  long as I live.  I never felt the least afraid of telling till to-day;\n  and you cannot think how unhappy it makes me.  And then, the thing\n  that provoked me to tell was that boy's being surly to me, and glad\n  that I was in disgrace this morning, for doing my lessons badly all\n  this week,--the very thing that should have made me particularly\n  careful how I behaved to him: for his pulling me off the wall was only\n  accident, after all.  Everything has gone wrong to-day; and I am very\n  unhappy, and I feel as if I should never be sure of anything again;\n  and so I write to you.  You told me you expected me not to fail; and\n  you see I have; and the next thing is that I must tell you of it.\n\n  \"Your affectionate son,\n\n  \"Hugh Proctor.\n\n  \"PS.  Phil has been very kind about my lessons, till this week\n  [_interlined_], when he has been very busy.\n\n  \"PS.  If you should answer this, please put `private' outside, or at\n  the top; and then Mr Tooke will not read it, nor anybody.  But I know\n  you are very busy always; so I do not quite expect an answer.\"\n\nWhen the letter was finished and closed, Hugh felt a good deal relieved:\nbut still not happy.  He had opened his heart to the best friend he had\nin this world: but he still felt grievously humbled for the present, and\nalarmed for the future.  Then he remembered that he might seek comfort\nfrom a better Friend still; and that He who had sent him his trial could\nand would help him to bear it with honour as well as with patience.  As\nhe thought of this, he saw that the boys were trooping home, along the\nroad, and he slipped out, and into the orchard, where he knew he might\nbe alone with his best Friend.  He stayed there till the supper-bell\nrang; and when he came in, it was with a cheerful face.  He was as merry\nas anybody at supper: and afterwards he found his lessons more easy to\nhim than usual.  The truth was that his mind was roused by the conflicts\nof the day.  He said his lessons to Phil (who found time to-night to\nhear him), without missing a word.  When he went to bed, he had several\npleasant thoughts.  His secret was still his own (though by no merit of\nhis); to-morrow was Sunday,--likely to be a bright, sweet May Sunday,--\nhis lessons were quite ready for Monday; and possibly there might be a\nletter from his mother in the course of the week.\n\nMrs Proctor was in the midst of her Monday morning's business (and\nMonday morning was the busiest of the week), when she received Hugh's\nletter.  Yet she found time to answer it by the very next post.  When\nher letter was handed to Hugh, with the seal unbroken, because `private'\nwas written large on the outside, we thought she was the kindest mother\nthat ever was, to have written so soon, and to have minded all his\nwishes.  Her letter was,--\n\n  \"Dear Hugh,\n\n  \"There was nothing in your letter to surprise me at all; for I\n  believe, if all our hearts were known, it would be found that we have\n  every one been saved from doing wrong by what we call accident.  The\n  very best people say this of themselves, in their thanksgivings to\n  God, and their confessions to one another.  Though you were very\n  unhappy on Saturday, I am not sorry that these things have happened,\n  as I think you will be the safer and the wiser for them.  You say you\n  never till then felt the least afraid of telling.  Now you know the\n  danger; and that is a good thing.  I think you will never again see\n  that boy (whoever he may be), without being put upon your guard.\n  Still, we are all sadly forgetful about our duty; and, if I were you,\n  I would use every precaution against such a danger as you have\n  escaped,--it makes me tremble to think how narrowly.  If I were you, I\n  would engage any friend I should become intimate with, the whole time\n  of being at school, and perhaps afterwards, never to say a word about\n  the accident,--or, at least, about how it happened.  Another way is to\n  tell me your mind, as you have now; for you may be sure that it is my\n  wish that you should keep your secret, and that I shall always be glad\n  to help you to do it.\n\n  \"But, my dear boy, I can do but little, in comparison with the best\n  Friend you have.  He can help you without waiting for your\n  confidence,--even at the very instant when you are tempted.  It is He\n  who sends these very accidents (as we call them) by which you have now\n  been saved.  Have you thanked Him for saving you this time?  And will\n  you not trust in His help henceforward; instead of supposing yourself\n  safe, as you now find you are not?  If you use His strength, I feel\n  that you will not fail.  If you trust your own intentions alone, I\n  shall never feel sure of you for a single hour, nor be certain that\n  the companion you love best may not be your worst enemy, in breaking\n  down your self-command.  But, as you say you were very unhappy on\n  Saturday, I have no doubt you did go for comfort to the right Friend,\n  and that you were happier on Sunday.\n\n  \"Your sisters do not know that I am writing, as I consider your letter\n  a secret from everybody but your father, who sends his love.  You need\n  not show this to Phil; but you can give him our love.  Your sisters\n  are counting the days to the holidays; and so are some older members\n  of the family.  As for Harry, he shouts for you from the yard every\n  day, and seems to think that every shout will bring nearer the happy\n  time when Phil and you will come home.\n\n  \"Your affectionate mother,\n\n  \"Jane Proctor.\"\n\nHugh was, of course, very glad of this letter.  And he was glad of\nsomething else;--that he had done the very things his mother had\nadvised.  He had engaged Dale not to tempt him on this subject any more.\nHe had opened his heart to his mother, and obtained her help; and he\nhad sought a better assistance, and a a higher comfort still.  It was so\ndelightful to have such a letter as this,--to be so understood and\naided, that he determined to tell his mother all his concerns, as long\nas he lived.  When, in the course of the holidays, he told her so, she\nsmiled, and said she supposed he meant as long as _she_ lived; for she\nwas likely to die long before he did.  Hugh could not deny this; but he\nnever liked to think about it:--he always drove away the thought; though\nhe knew, as his mother said, that this was rather cowardly, and that the\nwisest and most loving people in the world remember the most constantly\nand cheerfully that friends must be parted for a while, before they can\nlive together for ever.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. HOLT AND HIS HELP.\n\nNothing more was heard by Hugh, or any one else, of Lamb's debt.  The\ncreditor himself chose to say nothing about it, so much was he annoyed\nat being considered fond of money; but he was sure that Lamb's pockets\nwere filled, from time to time, as he was seen eating good things in\nby-corners when everybody knew that his credit with his companions, and\nwith all the neighbouring tradespeople, was exhausted.  It was\nsurprising that anybody could care so much for a shilling's worth of\ntarts or fruit as to be at the trouble of any concealment, or of\nconstantly getting out of Hugh's way, rather than pay, and have done\nwith it.  When Lamb was seen munching or skulking, Firth sometimes asked\nHugh whether he had got justice yet in that quarter: and then Hugh\nlaughed; and Firth saw that he had gained something quite as good,--a\npower of doing without it good-humouredly, from those who were so\nunhappy as not to understand or care for justice.\n\nIn one respect, however, Hugh was still within Lamb's power.  When Lamb\nwas not skulking, he was much given to boasting; and his boasts were\nchiefly about what a great man he was to be in India.  He was really\ndestined for India; and his own opinion was that he should have a fine\nlife of it there, riding on an elephant, with a score of servants always\nabout him, spending all his mornings in shooting, and all his evenings\nat dinners and balls.  Hugh did not care about the servants, sport, or\ndissipation; and he did not see why any one should cross the globe to\nenjoy things like these, which might be had at home.  But it did make\nhim sigh to think that a lazy and ignorant boy should be destined to\nlive among those mountains, and that tropical verdure of which he had\nread,--to see the cave-temples, the tanks, the prodigious rivers, and\nthe natives and their ways, of which his imagination was full, while he\nmust stay at home, and see nothing beyond London, as long as he lived.\nHe did not grudge Holt his prospect of going to India; for Holt was an\nimproved and improving boy, and had, moreover, a father there whom he\nloved very much: but Hugh could never hear Lamb's talk about India\nwithout being ready to cry.\n\n\"Do you think,\" he said to Holt, \"that all this is true?\"\n\n\"It is true that he is to go to India.  His father has interest to get\nhim out.  But I do not believe he will like it so well as he thinks.  At\nleast, I know that my father has to work pretty hard,--harder than Lamb\never worked, or ever will work.\"\n\n\"O dear!  I wish I could go and do the work; and I would send all the\nmoney home to him (except just enough to live upon), and then he might\ngo to dinners and balls in London, as much as he liked, and I could see\nthe Hindoos and the cave-temples.\"\n\n\"That is another mistake of Lamb's,--about the quantity of money,\" said\nHolt.  \"I do not believe anybody in India is so rich as he pretends, if\nthey work ever so hard.  I know my father works as hard as anybody, and\nhe is not rich; and I know the same of several of his friends.  So it is\nhardly likely that such a lazy dunce as Lamb should be rich, unless he\nhas a fortune here at home; and if he had that, I do not believe he\nwould take the trouble of going so far, to suffer by the heat.\"\n\n\"I should not mind the heat,\" sighed Hugh, \"if I could go.  You must\nwrite to me, Holt, all about India.  Write me the longest letters in the\nworld; and tell me everything you can think of about the natives, and\nJuggernaut's Car.\"\n\n\"That I will, if you like.  But I am afraid that would only make you\nlong the more to go,--like reading Voyages and Travels.  How I do wish,\nthough, that you were going with me by-and-by, as you let me go home\nwith you these holidays!\"\n\nIt was really true that Holt was going to London these holidays.  He was\nnot slow to acknowledge that Hugh's example had put into him some of the\nspirit that he had wanted when he came to Crofton, languid, indolent,\nand somewhat spoiled, as little boys from India are apt to be; and Hugh,\nfor his part, saw now that he had been impatient and unkind towards\nHolt, and had left him forlorn, after having given him hopes that they\nwere to be friends and companions.  They were gradually becoming real\nfriends now; and the faster, because Holt was so humble as not to be\njealous of Hugh's still liking Dale best.  Holt was satisfied to be\nliked best when Dale could not be had; and as this was the case in the\nMidsummer holidays, he was grateful to be allowed to spend them with the\nProctors.\n\nHugh was so thankful for his father's kindness in giving him a companion\nof his own age, and so pleased to show Holt little Harry, and the leads,\nand the river, and his shelf of books, and Covent Garden Market, and\nother wonders of London, that any unpleasant feelings that the boys had\never entertained towards each other were quite forgotten, and they grew\nmore intimate every day.  It touched Hugh's heart to see how sorry Holt\nwas for every little trial that befel him, on coming home, altered as he\nwas.  Agnes herself did not turn red oftener, or watch more closely to\nhelp him than Holt did.  Hugh himself had to tell him not to mind when\nhe saw the shop-boy watching his way of walking, or little Harry trying\nto limp like him, or Susan pretending to find fault with him, as she\nused to do, as an excuse for brushing away her tears.  Holt was one of\nthe first to find out that Hugh liked to be sent errands about the\nhouse, or in the neighbourhood; and it was he who convinced the family\nof it, though at first they could not understand or believe it at all.\nWhen they saw, however, that Hugh, who used to like that his sisters\nshould wait upon him, and to be very slow in moving from his book, even\nat his mother's desire, now went up-stairs and down-stairs for\neverybody, and tried to be more independent in his habits than any one\nelse, they began to think that Holt knew Hugh's mind better than even\nthey, and to respect and love him accordingly.\n\nThere was another proof of friendship given by Holt, more difficult by\nfar; and in giving it, he showed that he really had learned courage and\nspirit from Hugh, or in some other way.  He saw that his friend was now\nand then apt to do what most people who have an infirmity are prone\nto,--to make use of his privation to obtain indulgences for himself, or\nas an excuse for wrong feelings; and when Holt could not help seeing\nthis, he resolutely told his friend of it.  No one else but Mrs Proctor\nwould see or speak the truth on such occasions; and when his mother was\nnot by, Hugh would often have done selfish things unchecked, if it had\nnot been for Holt.  His father pitied him so deeply, that he joked even\nabout Hugh's faults, rather than give him present pain.  Phil thought he\nhad enough to bear at Crofton, end that everybody should let him alone\nin the holidays.  His sisters humoured him in everything: so that if it\nhad not been for Holt, Hugh might have had more trouble with his faults\nthan ever, on going back to Crofton.\n\n\"Do you really and truly wish not to fail, as you say, Hugh?\" asked\nHolt.\n\n\"To be sure.\"\n\n\"Well, then, do try not to be cross.\"\n\n\"I am not cross.\"\n\n\"I know you think it is low spirits.  I am not quite sure of that: but\nif it is, would not it be braver not to be low in spirits?\"\n\nHugh muttered that that was fine talking for people that did not know.\n\n\"That is true, I dare say; and I do not believe I should be half as\nbrave as you, but I _should_ like to see you quite brave.\"\n\n\"It is a pretty thing for you to lecture me, when I got down those books\non purpose for you,--those Voyages and Travels.  And how can I look at\nthose same books, now and not--\"\n\nHugh could not go on, and he turned away his head.\n\n\"Was it for me?\" exclaimed Holt, in great concern.  \"Then I am very\nsorry.  I will carry them to Mrs Proctor, and ask her to put them quite\naway till we are gone back to Crofton.\"\n\n\"No, no.  Don't do that.  I want them,\" said Hugh, finding now that he\nhad not fetched them down entirely on Holt's account.  But Holt took him\nat his word, and carried the books away, and succeeded in persuading\nHugh that it was better not to look at volumes which he really almost\nknew by heart, and every crease, stain, and dog's-ear of which brought\nup fresh in his mind his old visions of foreign travel and adventure.\nThen, Holt never encouraged any conversation about the accident with\nSusan, or with Mr Blake, when they were in the shop; and he never\npretended to see that Hugh's lameness was any reason why he should have\nthe best of their places in the Haymarket Theatre (where they went\nonce), or be the chief person when they capped verses or played other\ngames round the table, in the evenings at home.  The next time Hugh was\nin his right mood, he was sure to feel obliged to Holt; and he sometimes\nsaid so.\n\n\"I consider you a real friend to Hugh,\" said Mrs Proctor, one day, when\nthey three were together.  \"I have dreaded seeing my boy capable only of\na short effort of courage;--bearing pain of body and mind well while\neverybody was sorry for him, and ready to praise him; and then failing\nin the long trial afterwards.  When other people are leaving off being\nsorry for him, you continue your concern for him, and still remind him\nnot to fail.\"\n\n\"Would not it be a pity, ma'am,\" said Holt, earnestly, \"would it not be\na pity for him to fail when he bore everything so well at first, and\nwhen he helped me so that I don't know what I should have done without\nhim?  He made me write to Mr Tooke, and so got me out of debt; and a\nhundred times, I am sure, the thought of him and his secret has put\nspirit into me.  It would be a pity if he should fail without knowing\nit, for want of somebody to put him in mind.  He might so easily think\nhe was bearing it all well, as long as he could talk about his foot, and\nmake a joke of being lame, when, all the while, he might be losing his\ntemper in other ways.\"\n\n\"Why, how true that is!\" exclaimed Hugh.  \"I was going to ask if I was\never cross about being lame: but I know I am about other things, because\nI am worried about that, sometimes.\"\n\n\"It is so easy to put you in mind,\" continued Holt; \"and we shall all be\nso glad if you are brave to the very end--\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Hugh.  \"Only do you go on to put me in mind--\"\n\n\"And _you_ will grow more and more brave, too,\" observed Mrs Proctor to\nHolt.\n\nHolt sighed; for he thought it would take a great deal of practice yet\nto make him a brave boy.  Other people thought he was getting on very\nfast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. CONCLUSION.\n\nThe longer these two boys were together, the more they wished they could\nspend their lives side by side; or, at least, not be separated by half\nthe globe.  Just before the Christmas holidays, some news arrived which\nstartled them so much that they could hardly speak to one another about\nit for some hours.  There was a deep feeling in their hearts which\ndisposed them to speak alone to the Ruler of their lives, before they\ncould even rejoice with one another.  When they meditated upon it, they\nsaw that the event had come about naturally enough; but it so exactly\nmet the strongest desire they had in the world, that if a miracle had\nhappened before their eyes, they could not have been more struck.\n\nHolt's father wrote a letter to Mr Proctor, which reached its\ndestination through Mr Tooke's hands; and Mr Tooke was consulted in\nthe whole matter, and requested by Mr Proctor to tell the two boys and\nPhil all about it.  These three were therefore called into Mr Tooke's\nstudy one day, to hear some news.\n\nThe letters which Mr Tooke read were about Hugh.  Mr Holt explained\nthat his son's best years were to be spent, like his own, in India; that\nhis own experience had made him extremely anxious that his son should be\nassociated with companions whom he could respect and love; and that he\nhad long resolved to use such interest as he had in bringing out only\nsuch a youth, or youths, as he could wish his son to associate with.  He\nmentioned that he was aware that one lad now at Crofton was destined for\nIndia--\n\n\"That is Lamb,\" whispered the boys to each other.\n\nBut that he did not hear of any friendship formed, or likely to be\nformed with advantage between his son and this young gentleman.\n\n\"No, indeed!\" muttered Holt.\n\nThere was one boy, however, Mr Holt went on to say, to whom his son\nseemed to be attached, and concerning whom he had related circumstances\nwhich inspired a strong interest, and which seemed to afford an\nexpectation of an upright manhood following a gallant youth.\n\nHere all the boys reddened, and Hugh looked hard at the carpet.\n\nThis boy had evidently a strong inclination for travel and adventure;\nand though his lameness put military or naval service out of the\nquestion, it might not unfit him for civil service in India.  If Mr\nTooke could give such a report of his health, industry, and capability\nas should warrant his being offered an appointment, and if his parents\nwere willing so to dispose of him, Mr Holt was anxious to make\narrangements for the education of the boys proceeding together, in order\nto their being companions in their voyage and subsequent employments.\nAnd then followed some account of what these arrangements were to be.\n\n\"Now, Proctor,\" said Mr Tooke to the breathless Hugh, \"you must\nconsider what you have to say to this.  Your parents are willing to\nagree if you are.  But if,\" he continued, with a kind smile, \"it would\nmake you very unhappy to go to India, no one will force your\ninclinations.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" said Hugh, \"I will work very hard,--I will work as hard as\never I can, if I may go.\"\n\n\"Well: you may go, you see, if you will work hard.  You can consider it\nquietly, or talk it over with your brother and Holt; and to-morrow you\nare to dine at your uncle's, where you will meet your father; and he and\nyou will settle what to write to Mr Holt, by the next ship.\"\n\n\"And you, sir,\" said Phil, anxiously--\"Mr Holt asks your opinion.\"\n\n\"My opinion is that your brother can be what he pleases.  He wants some\ninducement to pursue his learning more strenuously than he has done\nyet--\"\n\n\"I will, sir.  I will,\" indeed, cried Hugh.\n\n\"I believe you will.  Such a prospect as this will be an inducement, if\nanything can.  You are, on the whole, a brave boy; and brave boys are\nnot apt to be ungrateful to God or man; and I am sure you think it would\nbe ungrateful, both to God and man, to refuse to do your best in the\nsituation which gratifies the first wish of your heart.\"\n\nHugh could not say another word.  He made his lowest bow, and went\nstraight to his desk.  As the first fruits of his gratitude, he learned\nhis lessons thoroughly well that night; much as he would have liked to\nspend the time in dreaming.\n\nHis father and he had no difficulty in settling what to write to Mr\nHolt; and very merry were they together when the business was done.  In\na day or two, when Hugh had had time to think, he began to be glad on\nTooke's account; and he found an opportunity of saying to him one day,--\n\n\"I never should have gone to India if I had not lost my foot; and I\nthink it is well worth while losing my foot to go to India.\"\n\n\"Do you really?  Or do you say it because--\"\n\n\"I think so really.\"  And then he went off into such a description as\nconvinced Tooke that he was in earnest, though it was to be feared that\nhe would be disappointed by experience.  But then again, Mr Tooke was\nheard to say that one chief requisite for success and enjoyment in\nforeign service of any kind was a strong inclination for it.  So Tooke\nwas consoled, and easier in mind than for a whole year past.\n\nHugh was able to keep his promise of working hard.  Both at Crofton and\nat the India College, where his education was finished, he studied well\nand successfully; and when he set sail with his companion, it was with a\nheart free from all cares but one.  Parting from his family was\ncertainly a great grief; and he could not forget the last tone he had\nheard from Agnes.  But this was his only sorrow.  He was, at last, on\nthe wide sea, and going to Asia.  Holt was his dear friend.  He had left\nnone but well-wishers behind.  His secret was his own; (though, indeed,\nhe scarcely remembered that he had any secret;) and he could not but be\nconscious that he went out well prepared for honourable duty.\n\nTHE END.\n",
