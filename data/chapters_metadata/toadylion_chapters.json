R. CROCKETT\n\n\n\n    [TOO GOOD BOYS NOT ALLOWED TO READ THIS BOOK\n    BY ORDER FIELD MARSHAL NAPOLEON SMITH]\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. PRISSY, HUGH JOHN, AND SIR TOADY LION.\n\n\nIt is always difficult to be great, but it is specially difficult when\ngreatness is thrust upon one, as it were, along with the additional\nburden of a distinguished historical name. This was the case with\nGeneral Napoleon Smith. Yet when this story opens he was not a\ngeneral. That came later, along with the cares of empire and the\nmanagement of great campaigns.\n\nBut already in secret he was Napoleon Smith, though his nurse\nsometimes still referred to him as Johnnie, and his father--but stay.\nI will reveal to you the secret of our soldier's life right at the\nstart. Though a Napoleon, our hero was no Buonaparte. No, his name was\nSmith--plain Smith; his father was the owner of four large farms and a\ngood many smaller ones, near that celebrated Border which separates\nthe two hostile countries of England and Scotland. Neighbours referred\nto the General's father easily as \"Picton Smith of Windy Standard,\"\nfrom the soughing, mist-nursing mountain of heather and fir-trees\nwhich gave its name to the estate, and to the large farm he had\ncultivated himself ever since the death of his wife, chiefly as a\nmeans of distracting his mind, and keeping at a distance loneliness\nand sad thoughts.\n\nHugh John Smith had never mentioned the fact of his Imperial descent\nto his father, but in a moment of confidence he had told his old\nnurse, who smiled with a world-weary wisdom, which betrayed her\nknowledge of the secrets of courts--and said that doubtless it was so.\nHe had also a brother and sister, but they were not, at that time, of\nthe race of the Corporal of Ajaccio. On the contrary, Arthur George,\nthe younger, aged five, was an engine-driver. There was yet another\nwho rode in a mail-cart, and puckered up his face upon being\naddressed in a strange foreign language, as \"Was-it-then? A\ndarling--goo-goo--then it was!\" This creature, however, was not owned\nas a brother by Hugh John and Arthur George, and indeed may at this\npoint be dismissed from the story. The former went so far as stoutly\nto deny his brother's sex, in the face of such proofs as were daily\nafforded by Baby's tendency to slap his sister's face wherever they\nmet, and also to seize things and throw them on the floor for the\npleasure of seeing them break. Arthur George, however, had secret\nhopes that Baby would even yet turn out a satisfactory boy whenever he\nsaw him killing flies on the window, and on these occasions hounded\nhim on to yet deadlier exertions. But he dared not mention his\nanticipations to his soldier brother, that haughty scion of an\nImperial race. For reasons afterwards to be given, Arthur George was\nusually known as Toady Lion.\n\nThen Hugh John had a sister. Her name was Priscilla. Priscilla was\ndistinguished also, though not in a military sense. She was literary,\nand wrote books \"on the sly,\" as Hugh John said. He considered this\nsecrecy the only respectable part of a very shady business. Specially\nhe objected to being made to serve as the hero of Priscilla's tales,\nand went so far as to promise to \"thump\" his sister if he caught her\nintroducing him as of any military rank under that of either general\nor colour-sergeant.\n\n\"Look here, Pris,\" he said on one occasion, \"if you put me into your\nbeastly girl books all about dolls and love and trumpery, I'll bat you\nover the head with a wicket!\"\n\n\"Hum--I dare say, if you could catch me,\" said Priscilla, with her\nnose very much in the air.\n\n\"Catch you! I'll catch and bat you now if you say much.\"\n\n\"Much, much! Can't, can't! There! 'Fraid cat! Um-m-um!\"\n\n\"By Jove, then, I just will!\"\n\nIt is sad to be obliged to state here, in the very beginning of these\nveracious chronicles, that at this time Prissy and Napoleon Smith were\nby no means model children, though Prissy afterwards marvellously\nimproved. Even their best friends admitted as much, and as for their\nenemies--well, their old gardener's remarks when they chased each\nother over his newly planted beds would be out of place even in a\nmilitary periodical, and might be the means of preventing a book with\nMr. Gordon Browne's nice pictures from being included in some\nwell-conducted Sunday-school libraries.\n\nGeneral Napoleon Smith could not catch Priscilla (as, indeed, he well\nknew before he started), especially when she picked up her skirts and\nwent right at hedges and ditches like a young colt. Napoleon looked\nupon this trait in Prissy's character as degrading and unsportsmanlike\nin the extreme. He regarded long skirts, streaming hair, and flapping,\naggravating pinafores as the natural handicap of girls in the race of\nlife, and as particularly useful when they \"cheeked\" their brothers.\nIt was therefore wicked to neutralise these equalising disadvantages\nby strings tied round above the knees, or by the still more scientific\ndevice of a sash suspended from the belt before, passed between\nPrissy's legs, and attached to the belt behind.\n\nBut, then, as Napoleon admitted even at ten years of age, girls are\ncapable of anything; and to his dying day he has never had any reason\nto change his opinion--at least, so far as he has yet got.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All right, then, I will listen to your old stuff if you will say you\nare sorry, and promise to be my horse, and let me lick you for an hour\nafterwards--besides giving me a penny.\"\n\nIt was thus that Priscilla, to whom in after times great lights of\ncriticism listened with approval, was compelled to stoop to artifice\nand bribery in order to secure and hold her first audience. Whereupon\nthe authoress took paper from her pocket, and as she did so, held the\nmanuscript with its back to Napoleon Smith, in order to conceal the\nsuspicious shortness of the lines. But that great soldier instantly\ndetected the subterfuge.\n\n\"It's a penny more for listening to poetry!\" he said, with sudden\nalacrity.\n\n\"I know it is,\" replied Prissy sadly, \"but you might be nice about it\njust this once. I'm dreadfully, dreadfully poor this week, Hugh John!\"\n\n\"So am I,\" retorted Napoleon Smith sternly; \"if I wasn't, do you think\nI would listen at all to your beastly old poetry? Drive on!\"\n\nThus encouraged, Priscilla meekly began--\n\n    \"_My love he is a soldier bold,\n      And my love is a knight;\n    He girds him in a coat of mail,\n      When he goes forth to fight._\"\n\n\"That's not quite so bad as usual,\" said Napoleon condescendingly,\ntoying meanwhile with the lash of an old dog-whip he had just \"boned\"\nout of the harness-room. Priscilla beamed gratefully upon her critic,\nand proceeded--\n\n    \"_He rides him forth across the sand_----\"\n\n\"Who rides whom?\" cried Napoleon. \"Didn't the fool ride a horse?\"\n\n\"It means himself,\" said Priscilla meekly.\n\n\"Then why doesn't _it_ say so?\" cried the critic triumphantly, tapping\nhis boot with the \"boned\" dog-whip just like any ordinary lord of\ncreation in presence of his inferiors.\n\n\"It's poetry,\" explained Priscilla timidly.\n\n\"It's silly!\" retorted Napoleon, judicially and finally.\n\nPriscilla resumed her reading in a lower and more hurried tone. She\nknew that she was skating over thin ice.\n\n    \"_He rides him forth across the sand,\n      Upon a stealthy steed._\"\n\n\"You mean 'stately,' you know,\" interrupted Napoleon--somewhat rudely,\nPriscilla thought. Yet he was quite within his rights, for Priscilla\nhad not yet learned that a critic always knows what you mean to say\nmuch better than you do yourself.\n\n\"No, I don't mean 'stately,'\" said Priscilla, \"I mean 'stealthy,' the\nway a horse goes on sand. You go and gallop on the sea-shore and\nyou'll find out.\"\n\n\"I shan't. I haven't got any sea-shore,\" said Napoleon. \"But do hurry.\nI've listened quite a pennyworth now.\"\n\n    \"_He rides him forth across the sand,\n      Upon a stealthy steed,\n    And when he sails upon the sea,\n      He plays upon a reed!_\"\n\n\"Great soft _he_ was,\" cried Napoleon Smith; \"and if ever I hear you\nsay that I did such a thing----\"\n\nPriscilla hurried on more quickly than ever.\n\n    \"_In all the world there's none can do\n      The deeds that he hath done:\n    When he hath slain his enemies,\n      Then he comes back alone._\"\n\n\"That's better!\" said Napoleon, nodding encouragement. \"At any rate it\nisn't long. Now, give me my penny.\"\n\n\"Shan't,\" said Priscilla, the pride of successful achievement swelling\nin her breast; \"besides, it isn't Saturday yet, and you've only\nlistened to three verses anyway. You will have to listen to ever so\nmuch more than that before you get a penny.\"\n\n\"Hugh John! Priscilla!\" came a voice from a distance.\n\nThe great soldier Napoleon Smith instantly effected a retreat in\nmasterly fashion behind a gooseberry bush.\n\n\"There's Jane calling us,\" said Priscilla; \"she wants us to go in and\nbe washed for dinner.\"\n\n\"Course she does,\" sneered Napoleon; \"think she's out screeching like\nthat for fun? Well, let her. I am not going in to be towelled till I'm\nall over red and scurfy, and get no end of soap in my eyes.\"\n\n\"But Jane wants you; she'll be _so_ cross if you don't come.\"\n\n\"_I_ don't care for Jane,\" said Napoleon Smith with dignity, but all\nthe same making himself as small as possible behind his gooseberry\nbush.\n\n\"But if you don't come in, Jane will tell father----\"\n\n\"_I_ don't care for father--\" the prone but gallant General was\nproceeding to declare in the face of Priscilla's horrified\nprotestations that he mustn't speak so, when a slow heavy step was\nheard on the other side of the hedge, and a deep voice uttered the\nsingle syllable, \"_John!_\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" a meek young man standing up behind the gooseberry bush\ninstantly replied: he was trying to brush himself as clean as\ncircumstances would permit. \"Yes, father; were you calling me,\nfather?\"\n\nIncredible as it seems, the meek and apologetic words were those of\nthat bold enemy of tyrants, General Napoleon Smith.\n\nPriscilla smiled at the General as he emerged from the hands of Jane,\n\"red and scurfy,\" just as he had said. She smiled meaningly and\naggravatingly, so that Napoleon was reduced to shaking his clenched\nfist covertly at her.\n\n\"Wait till I get you out,\" he said, using the phrase time-honoured by\nsuch occasions.\n\nPriscilla Smith only smiled more meaningly still. \"First catch your\nhare!\" she said under her breath.\n\nNapoleon Smith stalked in to lunch, the children's dinner at the house\nof Windy Standard, with an expression of fixed and Byronic gloom on\nhis face, which was only lightened by the sight of his favourite\npigeon-pie (with a lovely crust) standing on the side-board.\n\n\"Say grace, Hugh John,\" commanded his father.\n\nAnd General Napoleon Smith said grace with all the sweet innocence of\na budding angel singing in the cherub choir, aiming at the same time a\nkick at his sister underneath the table, which overturned a footstool\nand damaged the leg of a chair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE GOSPEL OF DASHT-MEAN.\n\n\nIt was on the day preceding a great review near the Border town of\nEdam, that Hugh John Picton Smith first became a soldier and a\nNapoleon. His father's house was connected by a short avenue with a\ngreat main road along which king and beggar had for a thousand years\ngone posting to town. Now the once celebrated highway lies deserted,\nfor along the heights to the east run certain bars of metal, shining\nand parallel, over which rush all who can pay the cost of a\nthird-class ticket--a roar like thunder preceding them, white steam\nand sulphurous reek wreathing after them. The great highway beneath is\nabandoned to the harmless impecunious bicyclist, and on the North Road\nthe sweeping cloud dust has it all its own way.\n\nBut Hugh John loved the great thoroughfare, deserted though it was. To\nhis mind there could be no loneliness upon its eye-taking stretches,\nfor who knew but out of the dust there might come with a clatter Mr.\nDick Turpin, late of York and Tyburn; Robert the Bruce, charging south\ninto England with his Galloway garrons, to obtain some fresh English\nbeef wherewithal to feed his scurvy Scots; or (best of all) his\nMajesty King George's mail-coach Highflyer, the picture of which,\ncoloured and blazoned, hung in his father's workroom.\n\nPeople told him that all these great folks were long since dead. But\nHugh John knew better than to believe any \"rot\" grown-ups might choose\nto palm off on him. What did grown-ups know anyway? They were rich, of\ncourse. Unlimited shillings were at their command; and as for\npennies--well, all the pennies in the world lived in their breeches'\npockets. But what use did they make of these god-like gifts? Did you\never meet them at the tuck-shop down in the town buying fourteen\ncheese-cakes for a shilling, as any sensible person would? Did they\nplay with \"real-real trains,\" drawn by locomotives of shining brass?\nNo! they preferred either one lump of sugar or none at all in their\ntea. This showed how much they knew about what was good for them.\n\nSo if such persons informed him that Robert the Bruce had been dead\nsome time, or showed him the rope with which Turpin was hung, coiled\non a pedestal in a horrid dull museum (free on Saturdays, 10 to 4),\nHugh John Picton looked and nodded, for he was an intelligent boy.\nIf you didn't nod sometimes as if you were taking it all in, they\nwould explain it all over again to you--with abominable dates and\nadditional particulars, which they would even ask you afterwards if\nyou remembered.\n\n[\"MR. DICK TURPIN, LATE OF YORK AND TYBURN.\"]\n\nFor many years Hugh John had gone every day down to the porter's lodge\nat the end of the avenue, and though old Betty the rheumaticky warder\nwas not allowed to let him out, he stared happily enough through the\nbars. It was a white gate of strong wood, lovely to swing on if you\nhappened to be there when it was opened for a carriageful of\ncalling-folk in the afternoon, or for Hugh John's father when he went\nout a-riding.\n\nBut you had to hide pretty quick behind the laurels, and rush out in\nthat strictly limited period before old Betty found her key, and yet\nafter the tail of Agincourt, his father's great grey horse, had\nswitched round the corner. If you were the least late, Betty would get\nahead of you, and the gates of Paradise would be shut. If you were a\nmoment too soon, it was just as bad--or even worse. For then the voice\nof \"He-whom-it-was-decidedly-most-healthy-to-obey\" would sound up the\nroad, commanding instant return to the Sandheap or the High Garden.\n\nSo on these occasions Hugh John mostly brought Sir Toady Lion with\nhim--otherwise Arthur George the Sturdy, and at yet other times\nvariously denominated Prince Murat, the Old Guard, the mob that was\nscattered with the whiff of grapeshot, and (generally) the whole\nGrand Army of the First Empire. Toady Lion (his own first effort at\nthe name of his favourite hero Richard Coeur-de-Lion) had his\norders, and with guile and blandishments held Betty in check till the\nlast frisk of Agincourt's tail had disappeared round the corner. Then\nHugh John developed his plans of assault, and was soon swinging on the\ngate.\n\n\"Out of the way with you, Betty,\" he would cry, \"or you will get\nhurt--sure.\"\n\nFor the white gate shut of itself, and you had only to push it open,\njump on, check it at the proper place on the return journey, and with\nyour foot shove off again to have scores and scores of lovely swings.\nThen Betty would go up the avenue and shout for her husband, who was\nthe aforesaid crusty old gardener. She would have laid down her life\nfor Toady Lion, but by no means even a part of it for Hugh John, which\nwas unfair. Old Betty had once been upset by the slam of the gate on a\nwindy day, and so was easily intimidated by the shouts of the horseman\nand the appalling motion of his white five-barred charger.\n\nSuch bliss, however, was transient, and might have to be expiated in\nvarious ways--at best with a slap from the hand of Betty (which was as\ngood as nothing at all), at worst, by a visit to father's\nworkroom--which could not be thought upon without a certain sense of\nsolemnity, as if Sunday had turned up once too often in the middle of\nthe week.\n\nBut upon this great day of which I have to tell, Hugh John had been\nhonourably digging all the morning in the sand-hole. He had on his\nred coat, which was his most secret pride, and he was devising a\nstill more elaborate system of fortification. Bastion and trench,\nscarp and counter-scarp, lunette and ravelenta (a good word), Hugh\nJohn had made them all, and he was now besieging his own creation with\nthe latest thing in artillery, calling \"Boom!\" when he fired off his\ncannon, and \"Bang-whack!\" as often as the projectile hit the wall and\nbrought down a foot of the noble fortification, lately so laboriously\nconstructed and so tenderly patted into shape.\n\nSuddenly there came a sound which always made the heart of Hugh John\nbeat in his side. It was the low thrilling reverberation of the drum.\nHe had only time to dash for his cap, which he had filled with sand\nand old nails in order to \"be a bomb-shell\"; empty it, put it on his\nhead, gird on his London sword-with-the-gold-hilt, and fly.\n\nAs he ran down the avenue the shrill fifes kept stinging his ears and\nmaking him feel as if needles were running up and down his back. It\nwas at this point that Hugh John had a great struggle with himself.\nPriscilla and Toady Lion were playing at \"House\" and \"Tea-parties\"\nunder the weeping elm on the front lawn. It was a debasing taste,\ncertainly, but after all blood was thicker than water. And--well, he\ncould not bear that they should miss the soldiers. But then, on the\nother hand, if he went back the troops might be past before he reached\nthe gate, and Betty, he knew well, would not let him out to run after\nthem, and the park wall was high.\n\nIn this desperate strait Hugh John called all the resources of\nreligion to his aid.\n\n\"It would,\" he said, \"be dasht-mean to go off without telling them.\"\n\nHugh John did not know exactly what \"dasht-mean\" meant. But he had\nheard his cousin Fred (who was grown up, had been a year at school,\nand wore a tall hat on Sundays) tell how all the fellows said that it\nwas better to die-and-rot than to be \"dasht-mean\"; and also how those\nwho in spite of warnings proved themselves \"dasht-mean\" were sent to a\nplace called Coventry--which from all accounts seemed to be a\n\"dasht-mean\" locality.\n\nSo Hugh John resolved that he would never get sent there, and whenever\na little thing tugged down in his stomach and told him \"not to,\" Hugh\nJohn said, \"Hang it! I won't be dasht-mean.\"--And wasn't.\n\nGrown-ups call these things conscience and religion; but this is how\nit felt to Hugh John, and it answered just as well--or even better.\n\nSo when the stinging surge of distant pipes sent the wild blood\ncoursing through his veins, and he felt his face grow cold and prickly\nall over, Napoleon Smith started to run down the avenue. He could not\nhelp it. He must see the soldiers or die. But all the same _Tug-tug_\nwent the little string remorselessly in his stomach.\n\n\"I must see them. I must--I must!\" he cried, arguing with himself and\ntrying to drown the inner voice.\n\n\"_Tug-tug-tug!_\" went the string, worse than that which he once put\nround his toe and hung out of the window, for Tom Cannon the\nunder-keeper to wake him with at five in the morning to go\nrabbit-ferreting.\n\nHugh John turned towards the house and the weeping elm.\n\n\"It's a blooming shame,\" he said, \"and they won't care anyway. But I\n_can't_ be dasht-mean!\"\n\nAnd so he ran with all his might back to the weeping elm, and with a\nwarning cry set Prissy and Sir Toady Lion on the alert. Then with\nanxious tumultuous heart, and legs almost as invisible as the\ntwinkling spokes of a bicycle, so quickly did they pass one another,\nHugh John fairly flung himself in the direction of the White Gate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. HOW HUGH JOHN BECAME GENERAL NAPOLEON.\n\n\nEven dull Betty had heard the music. The White Gate was open, and with\na wild cry Hugh John sprang through. Betty had a son in the army, and\nher deaf old ears were quickened by the fife and drum.\n\n\"Come back, Master Hugh!\" she cried, as he passed through and stood on\nthe roadside, just as the head of the column, marching easily, turned\nthe corner of the White Road and came dancing and undulating towards\nhim. Hugh John's heart danced also. It was still going fast with\nrunning so far; but at sight of the soldiers it took a new movement,\njust like little waves on a lake when they jabble in the wind, so nice\nand funny when you feel it--tickly too--down at the bottom of your\nthroat.\n\nThe first who came were soldiers in a dark uniform with very stern,\nbearded officers, who attended finely to discipline, for they were\nabout to enter the little town of Edam, which lay just below the white\ngates of Windy Standard.\n\nSo intently they marched that no one cast a glance at Hugh John\nstanding with his drawn sword, giving the salute which his friend\nSergeant Steel had taught him as each company passed. Not that Hugh\nJohn cared, or even knew that they did not see him. They were the\ncrack volunteer regiment of the Grey City beyond the hills, and their\nstandard of efficiency was something tremendous.\n\nThen came red-coats crowned with helmets, red-coats tipped with\nGlengarry bonnets, and one or two brass bands of scattering volunteer\nregiments. Hugh John saluted them all. No one paid the least attention\nto him. He did not indeed expect any one to notice him--a small dusty\nboy with a sword too big for him standing at the end of the road under\nthe shadow of the elms. Why should these glorious creations deign to\nnotice him--shining blades, shouldered arms, flashing bayonets, white\npipe-clayed belts? Were they not as gods, knowing good and evil?\n\nBut all the same he saluted every one of them impartially as they\ncame, and the regiments swung past unregarding, dust-choked, and\nthirsty.\n\nThen at last came the pipes and the waving tartans. Something cracked\nin Hugh John's throat, and he gave a little cry, so that his old\nnurse, Janet Sheepshanks, anxious for his welfare, came to take him\naway. But he struck at her--his own dear Janet--and fled from her\ngrasp to the other side of the road, where he was both safer and\nnearer to the soldiers. Swinging step, waving plumes, all in review\norder on came the famous regiment, every man stepping out with a\ntrained elasticity which went to the boy's heart. Thus and not\notherwise the Black Watch followed their pipers. Hugh John gave a long\nsigh when they had passed, and the pipes dulled down the dusky glade.\n\nThen came more volunteers, and yet more and more. Would they never\nend? And ever the sword of Hugh John Picton flashed to the salute, and\nhis small arm waxed weary as it rose and fell.\n\nThen happened the most astonishing thing in the world, the greatest\nevent of Hugh John's life. For there came to his ear a new sound, the\nclatter of cavalry hoofs. A bugle rang out, and Hugh John's eyes\nwatched with straining eagerness the white dust rise and swirl behind\nthe columns. Perhaps--who knows?--this was his reward for not being\ndasht-mean! But now Hugh John had forgotten Prissy and Toady Lion,\nfather and nurse alike, heaven, earth--and everything else. There was\nno past for him. He was the soldier of all time. His dusty red coat\nand his flashing sword were the salute of the universal spirit of man\nto the god of war--also other fine things of which I have no time to\nwrite.\n\nFor the noble grey horses, whose predecessors Napoleon had watched so\nwistfully at Waterloo, came trampling along, tossing their heads with\nan obvious sense of their own worth as a spectacle. Hugh John paled\nto the lips at sight of them, but drew himself more erect than ever.\nHe had seen foot-soldiers and volunteers before, but never anything\nlike this.\n\nOn they came, a fine young fellow leading them, sitting carelessly on\nthe noblest charger of all. Perhaps he was kindly by nature. Perhaps\nhe had a letter from his sweetheart in his breastpocket. Perhaps--but\nit does not matter, at any rate he was young and happy, as he sat\nerect, leading the \"finest troop in the finest regiment in the world.\"\nHe saw the small dusty boy in the red coat under the elm-trees. He\nmarked his pale twitching face, his flashing eye, his erect carriage,\nhis soldierly port. The fate of Hugh John stood on tiptoe. He had\nnever seen any being so glorious as this. He could scarce command\nhimself to salute. But though he trembled in every limb, and his under\nlip \"wickered\" strangely, the hand which held the sword was steady,\nand went through the beautiful movements of the military salute which\nSergeant Steel of the Welsh Fusiliers had taught him, with exactness\nand decorum.\n\nThe young officer smiled. His own hand moved to the response almost\ninvoluntarily, as if Hugh John had been one of his own troopers.\n\nThe boy's heart stood still. Could this thing be? A real soldier had\nsaluted him!\n\nBut there was something more marvellous yet to come. A sweet spring of\ngood deeds welled up in that young officer's breast. Heaven speed him\n(as doubtless it will) in his wooing, and make him ere his time a\ngeneral, with the Victoria Cross upon his breast. But though (as I\nhope) he rise to be Commander-in-Chief, he will never do a prettier\naction than that day, when the small grimy boy stood under the\nelm-trees at the end of the avenue of Windy Standard. This is what he\ndid. He turned about in his saddle.\n\n[\"IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER DONE FOR A\nFIELD-MARSHAL.\"]\n\n\"_Attention, men, draw swords!_\" he cried, and his voice rang like a\ntrumpet, so grand it was--at least so Hugh John thought.\n\nThere came a glitter of unanimous steel as the swords flashed into\nline. The horses tossed their heads at the stirring sound, and jingled\ntheir accoutrements as the men gathered their bridle reins up in their\nleft hands.\n\n\"_Eyes right! Carry swords!_\" came again the sharp command.\n\nAnd every blade made an arc of glittering light as it came to the\nsalute. It could not have been better done for a field-marshal.\n\nNo fuller cup of joy was ever drunk by mortal. The tears welled up in\nHugh John's eyes as he stood there in the pride of the honour done to\nhim. To be knighted was nothing to this. He had been acknowledged as a\nsoldier by the greatest soldier there. Hugh John did not doubt that\nthis glorious being was he who had led the Greys in the charge at\nWaterloo. Who else could have done that thing?\n\nHe was no longer a little dusty boy. He stood there glorified,\nennobled. The world was almost too full.\n\n\"_Eyes front! Slope swords!_\" rang the words once more.\n\nThe pageant passed by. Only the far drum-throb came back as he stood\nspeechless and motionless, till his father rode up on his way home,\nand seeing the boy asked him what he was doing there. Then for all\nreply a little clicking hitch came suddenly in his throat. He wanted\nto laugh, but somehow instead the tears ran down his cheeks, and he\ngasped out a word or two which sounded like somebody else's voice.\n\n\"I'm not hurt, father,\" he said, \"I'm not crying. It was only that the\nScots Greys saluted me. And I _can't_ help it, father. It goes\n_tick-tick_ in my throat, and I can't keep it back. But I'm not\ncrying, father! I'm not indeed!\"\n\nThen the stern man gathered the great soldier up and set him across\nhis saddle--for Hugh John was alone, the others having long ago gone\nback with Janet Sheepshanks. And his father did not say anything, but\nlet him sit in front with the famous sword in his hands which had\nbrought about such strange things. And even thus rode our hero\nhome--Hugh John Picton no more, but rather General Napoleon Smith; nor\nshall his rank be questioned on any army roster of strong unblenching\nhearts.\n\nBut late that night Hugh John stole down the hushed avenue, his bare\nfeet pattering through the dust which the dew was making cool. He\nclimbed the gate and stood under the elm, with the wind flapping his\nwhite nightgown like a battle flag. Then clasping his hands, he took\nthe solemn binding oath of his religion, \"_The Scots Greys saluted me.\nMay I die-and-rot if ever I am dasht-mean again!_\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. CASTLE PERILOUS.\n\n\nIn one corner of the property of Hugh John's father stood an ancient\ncastle--somewhat doubtfully of it, however, for it was claimed as\npublic property by the adjoining abbey town, now much decayed and\nfallen from its high estate, but desirous of a new lease of life as a\ntourist and manufacturing centre. The castle and the abbey had for\ncenturies been jealous neighbours, treacherous friends, embattled\nenemies according to the fluctuating power of those who possessed\nthem. The lord of the castle harried the abbot and his brethren. The\nabbot promptly retaliated by launching, in the name of the Church, the\ndread ban of excommunication against the freebooter. The castle\nrepresented feudal rights, the abbey popular and ecclesiastical\nauthority.\n\nAnd so it was still. Mr. Picton Smith had, indeed, only bought the\nproperty a few years before the birth of our hero; but, among other\nencumbrances, he had taken over a lawsuit with the town concerning the\ncastle, which for years had been dragging its slow length along. Edam\nAbbey was a show-place of world-wide repute, and the shillings of the\ntourist constituted a very important item in the finances of the\noverburdened municipality. If the Council and magistrates of the good\ntown of Edam could add the Castle of Windy Standard to their\nattractions, the resultant additional sixpence a head would go far\ntowards making up the ancient rental of the town parks, which now let\nfor exactly half of their former value.\n\nBut Mr. Picton Smith was not minded thus tamely to hand over an\nancient fortress, secured to him by deed and charter. He declared at\nonce that he would resist the claims of the town by every means in his\npower. He would, however, refuse right-of-way to no respectable\nsightseer. The painter, all unchallenged, might set up his easel\nthere, the poet meditate, even the casual wanderer in search of the\npicturesque and romantic, have free access to these gloomy and\ndesolate halls. The townspeople would be at liberty to conduct their\nfriends and visitors thither. But Mr. Smith was resolved that the\nancient fortalice of the Windy Standard should not be made a vulgar\nshow. Sandwich papers and ginger-beer bottles would not be permitted\nto profane the green sward of the courtyard, across which had so\noften ridden all the chivalry of the dead Lorraines.\n\n\"Those who want sixpenny shows will find plenty at Edam Fair,\" was Mr.\nPicton Smith's ultimatum. And when he had once committed himself, like\nmost of his stalwart name, Mr. Smith had the reputation of being very\nset in his mind.\n\nBut in spite of this the town asserted its right-of-way through the\ncourtyard. A footpath was said to have passed that way by which\npersons might go to and fro to kirk and market.\n\n\"I have no doubt a footpath passed through my dining-room a few\ncenturies ago,\" said Mr. Smith, \"but that does not compel me to keep\nmy front and back doors open for all the rabble of Edam to come and go\nat their pleasure.\"\n\nAnd forthwith he locked his lodge gates and bought the largest mastiff\nhe could obtain. The castle stood on an island rather more than a mile\nlong, a little below the mansion house. A wooden bridge led over the\ndeeper, narrower, and more rapid branch of the Edam River from the\ndirection of the abbey and town. Across the broader and shallower\nbranch there could be traced, from the house of Windy Standard, the\nremains of an ancient causeway. This, in the place where the stream\nwas to be crossed, had become a series of stepping-stones over which\nHugh John and Priscilla could go at a run (without falling in and\nwetting themselves more than once in three or four times), but which\nstill constituted an impregnable barrier to the short fat legs of\nToady Lion--who usually stood on the shore and proclaimed his woes to\nthe world at large till somebody carried him over and deposited him on\nthe castle island.\n\nAffairs were in this unsettled condition when, at twelve years of age,\nHugh John ceased to be Hugh John, and became, without, however, losing\nhis usual surname of Smith, one of the august and imperial race of the\nBuonapartes.\n\nIt was a clear June evening, the kind of night when the whole\nlandscape seems to have been newly swept, washed down, and generally\nspring-cleaned. All nature spoke peace to Janet Sheepshanks,\nhousekeeper, nurse, and general responsible female head of the house\nof Windy Standard, when a procession came towards her across the\nstepping-stones over the broad Edam water from the direction of the\ncastle island. Never had such a disreputable sight presented itself to\nthe eyes of Janet Sheepshanks. At once douce and severe, sharp-tongued\nand covertly affectionate, she represented the authority of a father\nwho was frequently absent from them, and the memory of a dead mother\nwhich remained to the three children in widely different degrees. To\nPriscilla her mother was a loving being, gracious alike by the tender\nsympathy of her voice and by the magic of a touch which healed all\nchildish troubles with the kiss of peace upon the place \"to make it\nwell.\" To Hugh John she had been a confidant to whom he could rush,\neager and dishevelled, with the tale of the glorious defeat of some\ntin enemy (for even in those prehistoric days Hugh John had been a\nsoldier), and who, smoothing back his ruffled hair, was prepared to\njoin as eagerly as himself in all his tiny triumphs. But to Toady\nLion, though he hushed the shrill persistence of his treble to a\nreverent murmur when he talked of \"muvver,\" she was only an\nimagination, fostered mostly by Priscilla--his notion of motherhood\nbeing taken from his rough-handed loving Janet Sheepshanks; while the\ntomb in the village churchyard was a place to which he had no desire\nto accompany his mother, and from whose gloomy precincts he sought to\nescape as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE DECLARATION OF WAR.\n\n\nBut, meanwhile, Janet Sheepshanks stands at the end of the\nstepping-stones, and Janet is hardly a person to keep waiting anywhere\nnear the house of Windy Standard.\n\nOver the stepping-stones came as leader Priscilla Smith, her head\nthrown back, straining in every nerve with the excitement of carrying\nSir Toady Lion, whose scratched legs and shoeless feet dangled over\nthe stream. Immediately beneath her, and wading above the knee in the\nrush of the water, there staggered through the shallows Hugh John,\nsupporting his sister with voice and hand--or, as he would have said,\n\"boosting her up\" whenever she swayed riverward with her burden,\npushing her behind when she hesitated, and running before to offer\nhis back as an additional stepping-stone when the spaces were wide\nbetween the boulders.\n\nJanet Sheepshanks waited grimly for her charges on the bank, and her\neyes seemed to deceive her, words to fail her, as the children came\nnearer. Never had such a sight been seen near the decent house of\nWindy Standard. Miss Priscilla and her pinafore were represented by a\nragged tinkler's lass with a still more ragged frill about her neck.\nHer cheeks and hands were as variously scratched as if she had fallen\ninto a whole thicket of brambles. Her face, too, was pale, and the\ntatooed places showed bright scarlet against the whiteness of her\nskin. She had lost a shoe, and her dress was ripped to the knee by a\ngreat ragged triangular tear, which flapped wet about her ankles as\nshe walked.\n\nSir Toady Lion was somewhat less damaged, but still showed manifold\nsigns of rough usage. His lace collar, the pride of Janet Sheepshanks'\nheart, was torn nearly off his shoulders, and now hung jagged and\nunsightly down his back. Several buttons of his well-ordered tunic\nwere gone, and as to his person he was mud as far above the knees as\ncould be seen without turning him upside down.\n\nBut Hugh John--words are vain to describe the plight of Hugh John. One\neye was closed, and began to be discoloured, taking on above the\ncheekbone the shot green and purple of a half-ripe plum. His lip was\ncut, and a thin thread of scarlet stealing down his brow told of a\nbroken head. What remained of his garments presented a ruin more\ncomplete, if less respectable, than the ancient castle of the Windy\nStandard. Neither shoe nor shoe-string, neither stocking nor collar,\nremained intact upon him. On his bare legs were the marks of cruel\nkicks, and for ease of transport he carried the _débris_ of his jacket\nunder his arm. He had not the remotest idea where his cap had gone to.\n\n[\"NO WONDER THAT JANET SHEEPSHANKS AWAITED THIS SORRY\nPROCESSION WITH A GRIM TIGHTENING OF THE LIPS.\"]\n\nNo wonder that Janet Sheepshanks awaited this sorry procession with a\ngrim tightening of the lips, or that her hand quivered with the desire\nof punishment, even while her kind and motherly heart yearned to be\nbusy repairing damages and binding up the wounded. Of this feeling,\nhowever, it was imperative that for the present, in the interests of\ndiscipline, she should show nothing.\n\nIt was upon Priscilla, as the eldest in years and senior responsible\nofficer in charge, that Janet first turned the vials of her wrath.\n\n\"Eh, Priscilla Smith, but ye are a ba-a-ad, bad lassie. Ye should ha'e\nyour bare back slashit wi' nettles! Where ha'e ye been, and what ha'e\nye done to these twa bairns? Ye shall be marched straight to your\nfather, and if he doesna gar ye loup when ye wad raither stand still,\nand claw where ye are no yeuky, he will no be doing his duty to the\nAlmichty, and to your puir mither that's lang syne in her restin'\ngrave in the kirk-yaird o' Edom.\"\n\nBy which fervent address in her native tongue, Janet meant that Mr.\nSmith would be decidedly spoiling the child if on this occasion he\nspared the rod. Janet could speak good enough formal English when she\nchose, for instance to her master on Sabbath, or to the minister on\nvisitation days; but whenever she was excited she returned to that\nvigorous ancient Early English which some miscall a dialect, and of\nwhich she had a noble and efficient command.\n\nTo Janet's attack, Priscilla answered not a word either of explanation\nor apology. She recognised that the case had gone far beyond that. She\nonly set Sir Toady Lion on his feet, and bent down to brush the mud\nfrom his tunic with her usual sisterly gesture. Janet Sheepshanks\nthrust her aside without ceremony.\n\n\"My wee man,\" she said, \"what have they done to you?\"\n\nToady Lion began volubly, and in his usual shrill piping voice, to\nmake an accusation against certain bad boys who had \"hit him,\" and\n\"hurted him,\" and \"kicked him.\" And now when at last he was safely\ndelivered and lodged in the well-proven arms of Janet Sheepshanks his\ntears flowed apace, and made clean furrows down the woebegone\ngrubbiness of his face.\n\nPriscilla walked by Janet's side, white and silent, nerving herself\nfor the coming interview. At ordinary times Janet Sheepshanks was\nterrible enough, and her word law in all the precincts of Windy\nStandard. But Priscilla knew that she must now face the anger of her\nfather; and so, with this in prospect, the railing accusations of her\nold nurse scarcely so much as reached her ears.\n\nHugh John, stripped of all military pomp, limped behind--a short, dry,\ncheerless sob shaking him at intervals. But in reality this was more\nthe protest of ineffectual anger than any concession to unmanly\nweakness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. FIRST BLOOD.\n\n\nTen minutes later, and without, as Jane Sheepshanks said, \"so muckle\nas a sponge or a brush-and-comb being laid upon them,\" the three stood\nbefore their father. Silently Janet had introduced them, and now as\nsilently she stood aside to listen to the evidence--and, as she\nput it, \"keep the maister to his duty, and mind him o' his\nresponsibilities to them that's gane.\"\n\nJanet Sheepshanks never forgot that she had been maid for twenty years\nto the dead mother of the children, nor that she had received \"the\nbits o' weans\" at her hand as a dying charge. She considered herself,\nwith some reason, to be the direct representative of the missing\nparent, and referred to Priscilla, Toady Lion, and Hugh John as \"my\nbairns,\" just as, in moments of affection, she would still speak to\nthem of \"my bonnie lassie your mither,\" as if the dead woman were\nstill one of her flock.\n\nFor a full minute Mr. Picton Smith gazed speechless at the spectacle\nbefore him. He had been writing something that crinkled his brow and\ncompressed his lips, and at the patter of the children's feet in the\npassage outside his door, as they ceremoniously marshalled themselves\nto enter, he had turned about on his great office chair with a smile\nof expectation and anticipation. The door opened, and Janet\nSheepshanks pushed in first Sir Toady Lion, still voluble and calling\nfor vengeance on the \"bad, bad boys at the castle that had striked him\nand hurted his dear Prissy.\" Priscilla herself stood white-lipped and\ndumb, and through the awful silence pulsed the dry, recurrent, sobbing\ncatch in the throat of Hugh John.\n\nMr. Picton Smith was a stern man, whose great loss had caused him to\nshut up the springs of his tenderness from the world. But they flowed\nthe sweeter and the rarer underneath; and though his grave and\ndignified manner daunted his children on the occasion of any notable\nevil-doing, they had no reason to be afraid of him.\n\n\"Well, what is the meaning of this?\" he said, his face falling into a\ngreyer and graver silence at the sound of Hugh John's sobs, and\nturning to Priscilla for explanation.\n\nMeanwhile Sir Toady Lion was pursuing the subject with his usual\nshrill alacrity.\n\n\"Be quiet, sir,\" said his father. \"I will hear you all one by one, but\nlet Priscilla begin--she is the eldest.\"\n\n\"We went to the castle after dinner, over by the stepping-stones,\"\nbegan Priscilla, fingering nervously the frill of the torn pinafore\nabout her throat, \"and when we got to the castle we found out that our\npet lamb Donald had come after us by the ford; and he was going\neverywhere about the castle, trying to rub his bell off his neck on\nthe gate-posts and on the stones at the corners.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I stooded on a rock, and Donald he butted me over behind!\"\ncame the voice of Sir Toady Lion in shrill explanation of his personal\nshare in the adventure.\n\n\"And then we played on the grass in the inside of the castle. Toady\nLion and I were plaiting daisy-chains and garlands for Donald, and\nHugh John was playing at being the Prisoner of Chillyon: he had tied\nhimself to the gate-post with a rope.\"\n\n\"'Twasn't,\" muttered Hugh John, who was a stickler for accuracy; \"it\nwas a plough-chain!\"\n\n\"And it rattled,\" added Sir Toady Lion, not to be out of the running.\n\n\"And just when we were playing nicely, a lot of horrid boys from the\ntown came swarming and clambering in. They had run over the bridge and\nclimbed the gate, and then they began calling us names and throwing\nmud. So Hugh John said he would tell on them.\"\n\n\"Didn't,\" interrupted Hugh John indignantly. \"I said I'd knock the\nheads off them if they didn't stop and get out; and they only laughed\nand said things about father. So I hit one of them with a stone.\"\n\n\"Then,\" continued Priscilla, gaining confidence from a certain curious\nspark of light which began to burn steadily in her father's eyes,\n\"after Hugh John threw the stone, the horrid boys all came and said\nthat they would kill us, and that we had no business there anyway.\"\n\n\"They frowed me down the well, and I went splass! Yes, indeedy!\"\ninterrupted Toady Lion, who had imagination.\n\n\"Then Donald, our black pet lamb, that is, came into the court, and\nthey all ran away after him and caught him. First he knocked down one\nor two of them, and then they put a rope round his neck and began to\ntake rides on his back.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he bleated and 'kye-kyed' just feeful!\" whimpered Toady\nLion, beginning to weep all over again at the remembrance.\n\nBut the Smith of the imperial race only clenched his torn hands and\nlooked at his bruised knuckles.\n\n\"So Hugh John said he would kill them if they did not let Donald go,\nand that he was a soldier. But they only laughed louder, and one of\nthem struck him across the lip with a stick--I know him, he's the\nbutch----\"\n\n\"Shut up, Pris!\" shouted Hugh John, with sudden fierceness, \"it's\ndasht-mean to tell names.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, sir,\" said his father severely; \"let your sister finish her\nstory in her own way.\"\n\nBut for all that there was a look of some pride on his face. At that\nmoment Mr. Picton Smith was not sorry to have Hugh John for a son.\n\n\"Well,\" said Priscilla, who had no such scruples as to telling on her\nenemies, \"I won't tell if you say not. But that was the boy who hurt\nDonald the worst.\"\n\n\"Well, I smashed him for that!\" muttered Napoleon Smith.\n\n\"And then when Hugh John saw them dragging Donald away and heard him\nbleating----\"\n\n\"And 'kye-kying' big, big tears, big as cherries!\" interjected Toady\nLion, who considered every narrative incomplete to which he did not\ncontribute.\n\n\"He was overcome with rage and anger\"--at this point Priscilla began\nto talk by the book, the dignity of the epic tale working on her--\"and\nhe rushed upon them fearlessly, though they were ten to one; and they\nall struck him and kicked him. But Hugh John fought like a lion.\"\n\n\"Yes, like Wichard Toady Lion,\" cried the namesake of that hero, \"and\nI helpted him and bited a bad boy on the leg, and didn't let go though\nhe kicked and hurted feeful! Yes, indeedy!\"\n\n\"And I went to their assistance and fought as Hugh John showed me.\nAnd--I forget the rest,\" said Priscilla, her epic style suddenly\nfailing her. Also she felt she must begin to cry very soon, now the\nstrain was over. So she made haste to finish. \"But it was dreadful,\nand they swore, and said they would cut Donald's throat. And one boy\ntook out a great knife and said he knew how to do it. He was the\nbutch----\"\n\n\"Shut up, Pris! Now don't you dare!\" shouted Hugh John, in his most\nwarning tones.\n\n\"And when Hugh John rushed in to stop him, he hit him over the head\nwith a stick, and Hugh John fell down. And, oh! I thought he was dead,\nand I didn't know what to do\" (Priscilla was crying in good earnest\nnow); \"and I ran to him and tried to lift him up. But I could not--he\nwas so wobbly and soft.\"\n\n\"I bited the boy's leg. It was dood. I bited hard!\" interrupted Toady\nLion, whose mission had been vengeance.\n\n\"And when I looked up again they had taken away p-p-poor Donald,\"\nPriscilla went on spasmodically between her tears, \"and I think they\nkilled him because he belonged to you, and--they said he had no\nbusiness there! Oh, they were such horrid cruel boys, and much bigger\nthan us. And I can't bear that Don should have his throat cut. I was\npromised that he should never be sold for mutton, but only clipped for\nwool. And he had such a pretty throat to hang daisy-chains on, and was\nsuch a dear, dear thing.\"\n\n\"I don't think they would dare to kill him,\" said Mr. Smith gravely;\n\"besides, they could not lift him over the gate. I will send at once\nand see. In fact I will go myself!\"\n\nThere was only anger against the enemy now, and no thought of\nchastisement of his own in the heart of Mr. Picton Smith. He was\nrising to reach out his hand to his riding-whip, when General Napoleon\nSmith, who, like most great makers of history, had taken little part\nin the telling of it, created a diversion which put all thought of\nimmediate action out of his father's head. He had been standing up,\nshoulders squared, arms dressed to his side, head erect, as he had\nseen Sergeant Steel do when he spoke to his Colonel. Once or twice he\nhad swayed slightly, but the heart of the Buonapartes, which beat\nbravely in his bosom, brought him up again all standing. Nevertheless\nhe grew even whiter and whiter, till, all in a moment, he gave a\nlittle lurch forward, checked himself, and again looked straight\nbefore him. Then he sobbed out once suddenly and helplessly, said \"I\ncouldn't help getting beaten, father--there were too many of them!\"\nand fell over all of a piece on the hearthrug.\n\nAt which his father's face grew very still and angry as he gathered\nthe great General gently in his arms and carried him upstairs to his\nown little white cot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE POOR WOUNDED HUSSAR.\n\n\nIt is small wonder that Mr. Picton Smith was full of anger. His castle\nhad been invaded and desecrated, his authority as proprietor defied,\nhis children insulted and abused. As a magistrate he felt bound to\ntake notice both of the outrage and of the theft of his property. As a\nfather he could not easily forget the plight in which his three\nchildren had appeared before him.\n\nBut in his schemes of vengeance he reckoned without that distinguished\nmilitary officer, General-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith. For this\nsoldier had been promoted on his bed of sickness. He had read\nsomewhere that in his profession (as in most others) success quite\noften bred envy and neglect, but that to the unsuccessful, promotion\nand honour were sometimes awarded as a sort of consolation\nsweepstakes. So, having been entirely routed and plundered by the\nenemy, it came to Hugh John in the watches of the night--when, as he\nput it, \"his head was hurting like fun\" that it was time for him to\ntake the final step in his own advancement.\n\nSo on the next morning he announced the change in his name and style\nto his army as it filed in to visit him. The army was on the whole\nquite agreeable.\n\n\"But I'm afraid I shall never remember all that, Mr.\nGeneral-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith!\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Well, you'd better!\" returned the wounded hero, as truculently as he\ncould for the bandages and the sticking-plaster, in which he was\nswathed after the fashion of an Egyptian mummy partially unwrapped.\n\n\"What a funny smell!\" piped Toady Lion. \"Do field-marshals _all_ smell\nlike that?\"\n\n\"Get out, silly!\" retorted the wounded officer. \"Don't you know that's\nthe stuff they rub on the wounded when they have fought bravely?\nThat's arnicay!\"\n\n\"And what do they yub on them when they don't fight bravely?\"\npersisted Toady Lion, who had had enough of fighting, and who in his\nheart was resolved that the next time he would \"yun away\" as hard as\nhe could, a state of mind not unusual after the _zip-zip_ of bullets\nis heard for the first time.\n\n\"First of all they catch them and kick them for being cowards. Then\nthey shoot at them till they are dead; and may the Lord have mercy on\ntheir souls! Amen!\" said General Smith, mixing things for the\ninformation and encouragement of Sir Toady Lion.\n\nPresently the children were called out to go and play, and the wounded\nhero was left alone. His head ached so that he could not read. Indeed,\nin any case he could not, for the room was darkened with the intention\nof shielding his damaged eyes from the light. General Napoleon could\nonly watch the flies buzzing round and round, and wish in vain that he\nhad a fly-flapper at the end of a pole in order to \"plop\" them, as he\nused to do all over the house in the happy days before Janet\nSheepshanks discovered what made the walls and windows so horrid with\ndead and dying insects.\n\n\"Yes; the squashy ones _were_ rather streaky!\" had been the words in\nwhich Hugh John admitted his guilt, after the pole and leathern\nflapper were taken from him and burned in the washhouse fire.\n\nThus in the semi-darkness Hugh John lay watching the flies with the\nstealthy intentness of a Red Indian scalper on the trail. It was sad\nto lie idly in bed, so bewrapped and swathed that (as he mournfully\nremarked), \"if one of the brutes were to settle on your nose, you\ncould only wait for him to crawl up, and then snatch at him with your\nleft eyelid.\"\n\nSuddenly the disabled hero bethought himself of something. First,\nafter listening intently so as to be quite sure that \"the children\"\nwere outside the bounds of the house, the wounded general raised\nhimself on his elbow. But the effort hurt him so much that\ninvoluntarily he said \"Outch!\" and sank back again on the pillow.\n\n\"Crikey, but don't I smell just!\" he muttered, when, after one breath\nof purer air, he sank back into the pool of arnica vapour. \"I suppose\nI'll have to howl out for Janet. What a swot!\"\n\n\"Janet!--Ja-a-a-a-net!\" he shouted, and sighed a sigh of relief to\nfind that at least there was one part of him neither bandaged nor\ndrowned in arnica.\n\n\"Deil tak' the laddie!\" cried Janet, who went about her work all day\nwith one ear cocked toward the chamber of her brave sick soldier;\n\"what service is there in taking the rigging aff the hoose wi' your\nnoise? Did ye think I was doon at Edam Cross? What do ye want,\ncallant, that ye deafen my auld lugs like that? I never heard sic a\nladdie!\"\n\nBut General Smith did not answer any of these questions. He well knew\nJanet's tone of simulated anger when she was \"putting it on.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch _it_!\" he said darkly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE FAMILIAR SPIRIT.\n\n\nNow there was a skeleton in the cupboard of General Napoleon Smith. No\ndistinguished family can be respectable without at least one such. But\nthat of the new field-marshal was particularly dark and disgraceful.\n\nVery obediently Janet Sheepshanks vanished from the sick-room, and\npresently returned with an oblong parcel, which she handed to the hero\nof battles.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said; \"are you sure that the children are out?\"\n\n\"They are sailing paper boats on the mill-dam,\" said Janet, going to\nthe window to look.\n\nHugh John sighed a sigh. He wished he could sail boats on the\nmill-dam.\n\n\"I hope every boat will go down the mill lade, and get mashed in the\nwheel,\" he said pleasantly.\n\n\"For shame, Master Hugh!\" replied Janet Sheepshanks, shaking her head\nat him, but conscious that he was exactly expressing her own mind, if\nshe had been lying sick a-bed and had been compelled to listen to some\nother housekeeper jingling keys that once were hers, ransacking her\nsacredest repositories, and keeping in order the menials of the house.\n\nHugh John proceeded cautiously to unwrap his family skeleton.\nPresently from the folds of tissue paper a very aged and battered\n\"Sambo\" emerged. Now a \"Sambo\" is a black woolly-haired negro doll of\nthe fashion of many years ago. This specimen was dressed in simple and\nairy fashion in a single red shell jacket. As to the rest, he was bare\nand black from head to foot. Janet called him \"that horrid object\";\nbut, nevertheless, he was precious in the eyes of Hugh John, and\ntherefore in hers.\n\nThough twelve years of age, he still liked to carry on dark and covert\nintercourse with his ancient \"Sambo.\" In public, indeed, he preached,\nin season and out of season, against the folly and wickedness of\ndolls. No one but a lassie or a \"lassie-boy\" would do such a thing. He\nlaughed at Priscilla for cleaning up her doll's kitchen once a week,\nand for organising afternoon tea-parties for her quiet harem. But\nsecretly he would have liked very well to see Sambo sit at that\nbounteous board.\n\nNevertheless, he instructed Toady Lion every day with doctrine and\nreproof that it was \"only for girls\" to have dolls. And knowing well\nthat none of his common repositories were so remote and sacred as\nlong to escape Priscilla's unsleeping eye, or the more stormy though\nfitful curiosity of Sir Toady Lion, Hugh John had been compelled to\ntake his ancient nurse and ever faithful friend Janet into his\nconfidence. So Sambo dwelt in the housekeeper's pantry and had two\ndistinct odours. One side of him smelt of paraffin, and the other of\nsoft soap, which, to a skilled detective, might have revealed the\nsecret of his dark abode.\n\nBut let us not do our hero an injustice.\n\nIt was not exactly as a doll that General Smith considered Sambo. By\nno means so, indeed. Sometimes he was a distinguished general who came\nto take orders from his chief, sometimes an awkward private who needed\nto be drilled, and then knocked spinning across the floor for\ninattention to orders. For, be it remembered, it was the custom in the\narmy of Field-Marshal-General Smith for the Commander-in-Chief to\ndrill the recruits with his own voice, and in the by no means\nimprobable event of their proving stupid, to knock them endwise with\nhis own august hand.\n\nBut it was as Familiar Spirit, and in the pursuit of occult\ndivination, that General Napoleon most frequently resorted to Sambo.\nHe had read all he could find in legend and history concerning that\ngruesomely attractive goblin, clothed all in red, which the wicked\nLord Soulis kept in an oaken chest in a castle not so far from his own\nfather's house of Windy Standard.\n\nAnd Hugh John saw no reason why Sambo should not be the very one.\nSpirits do not die. It is a known fact that they are fond of their\nformer haunts. What, then, could be clearer? Sambo was evidently Lord\nSoulis' Red Imp risen from the dead. Was Sambo not black? The devil\nwas black. Did Sambo not wear a red coat? Was not the demon of the\noaken chest attired in flaming scarlet, when all cautiously he lifted\nthe lid at midnight and looked wickedly out upon his master?\n\nYet the General was conscious that Sambo Soulis was a distinct\ndisappointment in the part of familiar spirit. He would sit silent,\nwith his head hanging idiotically on one side, when he was asked to\nreveal the deepest secrets of the future, instead of toeing the line\nand doing it. Nor was it recorded in the chronicles of Soulis that the\noriginal demon of the chest had had his nose \"bashed flat\" by his\nmaster, as Hugh John vigorously expressed the damaged appearance of\nhis own familiar.\n\nWorse than all, Hugh John had tried to keep Sambo in his rabbit-box.\nBut not only did he utterly fail to put his \"fearful head, crowned\nwith a red night-cap\" over the edge of the hutch at the proper\ntime--as, had he been of respectable parentage, he would not have\nfailed to do, but, in addition, he developed in his close quarters an\nanimal odour so pungent and unprofitable that Janet Sheepshanks\nrefused to admit him into the store-cupboard till he had been\nthoroughly fumigated and disinfected. So for a whole week Sambo Soulis\nswung ignominiously by the neck from the clothes line, and Hugh John\nwent about in fear of the questioning of the children or of the\nconfiscation by his father of his well-beloved but somewhat\nunsatisfactory familiar spirit.\n\nIt was in order to consult him on a critical point of doctrine and\npractice that Hugh John had now sent for Sambo Soulis.\n\nHe propped him up before him against a pillow, on which he sat bent\nforward at an acute angle from the hips, as if ready to pounce upon\nhis master and rend him to pieces so soon as the catechism should be\nover.\n\n\"Look here,\" said General-Field-Marshal Smith to the oracle,\n\"supposing the governor tells me to split on Nipper Donnan, the\nbutcher boy, will it be dasht-mean if I do?\"\n\nSambo Soulis, being disturbed by the delicacy of the question or\nperhaps by the wriggling of Hugh John upon his pillow, only lurched\ndrivellingly forward.\n\n\"Sit up and answer,\" cried his master, \"or else I'll hike you out of\nthat pretty quick, for a silly old owl!\"\n\nAnd with his least bandaged hand he gave Sambo a sound cuff on the\nside of his venerable battered head, before propping him up at a new\nangle with his chin on his knees.\n\n\"Now speak up, Soulis,\" said General Smith; \"I ask you would it be\ndasht-mean?\"\n\nThe oracle was understood to joggle his chin and goggle his eyes. He\ncertainly did the latter.\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Soulis' master, as is usual in such cases,\ninterpreting the reply oracular according to his liking. \"But look\nhere, how are we to get back Donald unless we split? Would it not be\nall right to split just to get Donald back?\"\n\nSambo Soulis waggled his head again. This time his master looked a\nlittle more serious.\n\n\"I suppose you are right,\" he said pensively, \"but if it would be\ndasht-mean to split, we must just try to get him back ourselves--that\nis, if the beasts have not cut his throat, as they said they would.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. PUT TO THE QUESTION.\n\n\nIn the chaste retirement of his sick room the Field-Marshal had just\nreached this conclusion, when he heard a noise in the hall. There was\na sound of the gruff unmirthful voices of grown-ups, a scuffling of\nfeet, a planting of whips and walking-sticks on the zinc-bottomed\nhall-stand, and then, after a pause which meant drinks, heavy\nfootsteps in the passage which led to the hero's chamber.\n\nHugh John snatched up Sambo Soulis and thrust him deep beneath the\nbedclothes, where he could readily push him over the end with his\ntoes, if it should chance to be \"the doctor-beast\" come to uncover him\nand \"fool with the bandages.\" I have said enough to show that the\nGeneral was not only frankly savage in sentiment, but resembled his\ngreat imperial namesake in being grateful only when it suited him.\n\nBefore General Napoleon had his toes fairly settled over the back of\nSambo Soulis' neck, so as to be able to remove him out of harm's way\non any sudden alarm, the door opened and his father came in, ushering\ntwo men, the first of whom came forward to the bedside in an easy,\nkindly manner, and held out his hand.\n\n\"Do you know me?\" he said, giving Hugh John's second sorest hand such\na squeeze that the wounded hero was glad it was not the very sorest\none.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the hero promptly, \"you are Sammy Carter's father. I\ncan jolly well lick----\"\n\n\"Hugh John,\" interrupted his father severely, \"remember what you are\nsaying to Mr. Davenant Carter.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, I _can_ lick Sammy Carter till he's dumb-sick!\"\nmuttered the General between his teeth, as he avoided the three pairs\nof eyes that were turned upon him.\n\n\"Oh, let him say just what he likes!\" said Mr. Davenant Carter\njovially. \"Sammy is the better of being licked, if that is what the\nboy was going to say. I sometimes try my hand at it myself with some\nsuccess.\"\n\nThe other man who had come in with Mr. Smith was a thick-set fellow of\nmiddle height, with a curious air of being dressed up in somebody\nelse's clothes. Yet they fitted him very well. He wore on his face (in\naddition to a slight moustache) an expression which somehow made Hugh\nJohn think guiltily of all the orchards he had ever visited along\nwith Toady Lion and Sammy Carter's sister Cissy, who was \"no end of a\nnice girl\" in Hugh John's estimation.\n\n\"This, Hugh,\" said his father, with a little wave of his hand, \"is Mr.\nMant, the Chief Constable of the county. Mr. Carter and he have come\nto ask you a few questions, which you will answer at once.\"\n\n\"I won't be dasht-mean!\" muttered Napoleon Smith to himself.\n\n\"What's that?\" ejaculated Mr. Smith, catching the echo of his son's\nrumble of dissent.\n\n\"Only my leg that hurted,\" said the hypocritical hero of battles.\n\n\"Don't you think we should have the other children here?\" said Mr.\nChief Constable Mant, speaking for the first time in a gruff,\nmove-on-there voice.\n\n\"Certainly,\" assented Mr. Smith, going to the door. \"Janet!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nThe answer came from immediately behind the door.\n\nThe Field-Marshal's brow darkened, or rather it would have done so if\nthere had been no white bandages over it. This is the correct\nexpression anyhow--though ordinary brows but seldom behave in this\nmanner.\n\n\"Prissy's all right,\" he thought to himself, \"but if that little fool\nToady Lion----\"\n\nAnd he clenched his second sorest hand under the clothes, and kicked\nSambo Soulis to the foot of the bed in a way which augured but little\nmercy to Sir Toady Lion if, after all his training, he should turn\nout \"dasht-mean\" in the hour of trial.\n\nPresently the other two children were pushed in at the door, Toady\nLion trying a bolt at the last moment, which Janet Sheepshanks easily\nfoiled by catching at the slack of his trousers behind, while Prissy\nstood holding her hands primly as if in Sunday-school class. Both\nafforded to the critical eye of Hugh John complete evidence that they\nhad only just escaped from the Greater Pain of the comb and soaped\nflannel-cloth of Janet Sheepshanks. Prissy's curls were still wet and\nsmoothed out, and Toady Lion was trying in vain to rub the yellow soap\nout of his eyes.\n\nSo at the headquarters of its general, the army of Windy Standard\nformed up. Sir Toady Lion wished to get within supporting distance of\nPrissy, and accordingly kept snuggling nearer all the time, so that he\ncould get a furtive hold of her skirts at awkward places in the\nexamination. This he could do the more easily that General\nField-Marshal Smith was prevented by the bandages over his right eye,\nand also by the projecting edges of the pillow, from seeing Toady\nLion's left hand.\n\n\"Now, Priscilla,\" began her father, \"tell Mr. Davenant Carter and Mr.\nMant what happened in the castle, and the names of any of the bad boys\nwho stole your pet lamb.\"\n\n\"Wasn't no lamb--Donald was a sheep, and he could fight,\" began Toady\nLion, without relevance, but with his usual eagerness to hear the\nsound of his own piping voice. In his zeal he took a step forward and\nso brought himself on the level of the eye of his general, who from\nthe pillow darted upon him a look so freezing that Sir Toady Lion\ninstantly fell back into the ranks, and clutched Prissy's skirt with\nsuch energy as almost to stagger her severe deportment.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Chief Constable of Bordershire, \"tell me what were the\nnames of the assailants.\"\n\nHe was listening to the tale as told by Prissy with his note-book\nready in his hand, occasionally biting at the butt of the pencil, and\nanon wetting the lead in his mouth, under the mistaken idea that by so\ndoing he improved its writing qualities.\n\n\"I think,\" began Prissy, \"that they were----\"\n\n\"_A-chew!_\" came from the bed and from under the bandages with a\nsudden burst of sound. Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith had sneezed. That\nwas all.\n\nBut Prissy started. She knew what it meant. It was the well-known\nsignal not to commit herself under examination.\n\nHer father looked round at the open windows.\n\n\"Are you catching cold with the draught, Hugh John?\" he asked kindly.\n\n\"I think I have a little cold,\" said the wily General, who did not\nwish all the windows to be promptly shut.\n\n\"Don't know all their names, but the one that hurted me was----\" began\nToady Lion.\n\nBut who the villain was will never be known, for at that moment the\nbedclothes became violently disturbed immediately in front of Sir\nToady Lion's nose. A fearful black countenance nodded once at him and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Black Sambo!\" gasped Toady Lion, awed by the terrible appearance, and\nfalling back from the place where the wizard had so suddenly appeared.\n\n\"What did I understand you to say, little boy?\" said Mr. Mant, with\nhis pencil on his book.\n\n\"Ow--it was Black Sambo!\" Toady Lion almost screamed. Mr. Mant gravely\nnoted the fact.\n\n\"What in the world does he mean?\" asked Mr. Mant, casting his eyes\nsearchingly from Prissy to General Napoleon and back again.\n\n\"He means 'Black Sambo'!\" said Prissy, devoting herself strictly to\nfacts, and leaving the Chief Constable to his proper business of\ninterpreting them.\n\n\"What is his other name?\" said Mr. Mant.\n\n\"Soulis!\" said General Smith from the bed.\n\nThe three gentlemen looked at each other, smiled, and shook their\nheads.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" said Mr. Davenant Carter. \"Try as I will, I\ncannot get the simplest thing out of my Sammy and Cissy if they don't\nchoose to tell.\"\n\nNevertheless Mr. Smith, being a sanguine man and with little\nexperience of children, tried again.\n\n\"There is no black boy in the neighbourhood,\" said Mr. Smith severely;\n\"now tell the truth, children--at once, when I bid you!\"\n\nHe uttered the last words in a loud and commanding tone.\n\n\"Us is telling the troof, father dear,\" said Toady Lion, in the\n\"coaxy-woaxy\" voice which he used when he wanted marmalade from Janet\nor a ride on the saddle from Mr. Picton Smith.\n\n\"Perhaps the boy had blackened his face to deceive the eye,\" suggested\nMr. Mant, with the air of one familiar from infancy with the tricks\nand devices of the evil-minded of all ages.\n\n\"Was the ringleader's face blackened?--Answer at once!\" said Mr. Smith\nsternly.\n\nThe General extracted his bruised and battered right hand from under\nthe clothes and looked at it.\n\n\"I think so,\" he said, \"leastways some has come off on my knuckles!\"\n\nMr. Davenant Carter burst into a peal of jovial mirth.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you?--It isn't a bit of use badgering children when\nthey don't want to tell. Let's go over to the castle.\"\n\nAnd with that the three gentlemen went out, while Napoleon Smith,\nPrissy, and Sir Toady Lion were left alone.\n\nThe General beckoned them to his bedside with his nose--quite an easy\nthing to do if you have the right kind of nose, which Hugh John had.\n\n\"Now look here,\" he said, \"if you'd told, I'd have jolly well\nflattened you when I got up. 'Tisn't our business to tell p'leecemen\nthings.\"\n\n\"That wasn't a p'leeceman,\" said Sir Toady Lion, \"hadn't no shiny\nbuttons.\"\n\n\"That's the worst kind,\" said the General in a low, hissing whisper;\n\"all the same you stood to it like bricks, and now I'm going to get\nwell and begin on the campaign at once.\"\n\n\"Don't you be greedy-teeth and eat it all yourself!\" interjected\nToady Lion, who thought that the campaign was something to eat, and\nthat it sounded good.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" said Prissy, who had a great belief in the\nexecutive ability of her brother.\n\n\"I know their secret hold,\" said General-Field-Marshal Smith grandly,\n\"and in the hour of their fancied security we will fall upon them\nand----\"\n\n\"And what?\" gasped Prissy and Toady Lion together, awaiting the\nrevelation of the horror.\n\n\"Destroy them!\" said General Smith, in a tone which was felt by all\nparties to be final.\n\nHe laid himself back on his pillow and motioned them haughtily away.\nPrissy and Sir Toady Lion retreated on tiptoe, lest Janet should catch\nthem and send them to the parlour--Prissy to read her chapter, and her\nbrother along with her to keep him out of mischief.\n\nAnd so the great soldier was left to his meditations in the darkened\nhospital chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. A SCOUTING ADVENTURE.\n\n\nGeneral Smith, having now partially recovered, was mustering his\nforces and arranging his plans of campaign. He had spoken no hasty\nword when he boasted that he knew the secret haunt of the robbers.\nFor, some time before, during a brief but glorious career as a pirate,\nhe had been brought into connection with Nipper Donnan, the strongest\nbutcher's boy of the town, and the ringleader in all mischief,\ntogether with Joe Craig, Nosie Cuthbertson, and Billy M'Robert, his\nready followers.\n\nHugh John had once been a member of the Comanche Cowboys, as Nipper\nDonnan's band was styled; but a disagreement about the objects of\nattack had hastened a rupture, and the affair of the castle was but\nthe last act in a hostility long latent. In fact the war was always\nsimmering, and was ready to boil over on the slightest provocation.\nFor when Hugh John found that his father's orchards, his father's\ncovers and hencoops were to be the chief prey (being safer than the\nfarmers' yards, where there were big dogs always loose, and the town\nstreets, where \"bobbies\" mostly congregated), he struck. He reflected\nthat one day all these things would belong to himself. He would share\nwith Prissy and Sir Toady Lion, of course; but still mainly they would\nbelong to him. Why then plunder them now? The argument was utilitarian\nbut sufficient.\n\nThough he did not mention the fact to Prissy or Sir Toady Lion, Hugh\nJohn was perfectly well acquainted with the leaders in the fray at the\ncastle. He knew also that there were motives for the enmity of the\nComanche Cowboys other and deeper than the town rights to the\npossession of the Castle of Windy Standard.\n\nIt was night when Hugh John cautiously pushed up the sash of his\nwindow and looked out. A few stars were high up aloft wandering\nthrough the grey-blue fields of the summer night, as it were\nlistlessly and with their hands in their pockets. A corn-crake cried\nin the meadow down below, steadily, remorselessly, like the aching of\na tooth. A white owl passed the window with an almost noiseless whiff\nof fluffy feathers. Hugh John sniffed the cool pungent night smell of\nthe dew on the near wet leaves and the distant mown grass. It always\nwent to his head a little, and was the only thing which made him\nregret that he was to be a soldier. Whenever he smelt it, he wanted to\nbe an explorer of far-off lands, or an honest poacher--even a\ngamekeeper might do, in case the other vocations proved unattainable.\n\nHugh John got out of the window slowly, leaving Sir Toady Lion asleep\nand the door into Prissy's room wide open. He dropped easily and\nlightly upon the roof of the wash-house, and, steadying himself upon\nthe tiles, he slid down till he heard Cæsar, the black Newfoundland,\nstir in his kennel. Then he called him softly, so that he might not\nbark. He could not take him with him to-night, for though Cæsar was\nlittle more than a puppy his step was like that of a cow, and when\nreleased he went blundering end on through the woods like a festive\navalanche. Hugh John's father, for reasons of his own, persisted in\ncalling him \"The Potwalloping Elephant.\"\n\nSo, having assured himself that Cæsar would not bark, the boy dropped\nto the ground, taking the roof of the dog-kennel on the way. Cæsar\nstirred, rolled himself round, and came out breathing hard, and\nthump-thumping Hugh John's legs with his thick tail, with distinctly\naudible blows.\n\nThen when he understood that he was not to be taken, he sat down at\nthe extremity of his chain and regarded his master wistfully through\nthe gloom with his head upon one side; and as Hugh John took his way\ndown the avenue, Cæsar moaned a little, intoning his sense of injury\nand disappointment as the parson does a litany.\n\nAt the first turn of the road Hugh John had just time to dart aside\ninto the green, acrid-scented, leathery-leaved shrubbery, where he lay\ncrouched with his hands on his knees and his head thrust forward,\nwhile Tom the keeper went slowly by with his arm about Jane\nHousemaid's waist.\n\n[\"WAIT TILL THE NEXT TIME YOU WON'T LEND ME THE FERRET,\nTOM CANNON! O-HO, JANE HOUSEMAID, WILL YOU TELL MY FATHER THE NEXT\nTIME I TAKE YOUR DUST SCOOP?\"]\n\n\"Aha!\" chuckled Hugh John; \"wait till the next time you won't lend me\nthe ferret, Tom Cannon! O-ho, Jane Housemaid, will you tell my father\nthe next time I take your dust scoop out to the sand-hole to help dig\ntrenches? I think not!\"\n\nAnd Hugh John hugged himself in his pleasure at having a new weapon\nso admirably double-barrelled. He looked upon the follies of love, as\nmanifested in the servants' hall and upon the outskirts of the\nvillage, as so much excellent material by which a wise man would not\nfail to profit. Janet Sheepshanks was very severe on such\ndelinquencies, and his father--well, Hugh John felt that Tom Cannon\nwould not wish to appear before his master in such a connection. He\nhad a vague remembrance of a certain look he had once seen on his\nfather's face when Allan Chestney, the head-keeper, came out from Mr.\nPicton Smith's workroom with these words ringing in his ear, \"Now,\nsir, you will do as I tell you, or I will give you a character--_but_,\nsuch a character as you will carry through the world with you, and\nwhich will be buried with you when you die.\"\n\nAllan was now married to Jemima, who had once been cook at the house\nof Windy Standard. Hugh John went over to their cottage often to eat\nher delicious cakes; and when Allan came in from the woods, his wife\nordered him to take off his dirty boots before he entered her clean\nkitchen. Then Allan Chestney would re-enter and play submissively and\nfurtively with Patty Pans, their two-year-old child, shifting his\nchair obediently whenever Cook Jemima told him. But all the same, Hugh\nJohn felt dimly that these things would not have happened, save for\nthe look on his father's face when Allan Chestney went in to see him\nthat day in the grim pine-boarded workroom.\n\nSo, much lightened in his mind by his discovery, Hugh John took his\nway down the avenue. At the foot of it, and before he came to the\nlocked white gate and the cottage of Betty, he turned aside through a\ncopse, over a little green patch of sward on which his feet slid\nsmooth as velvet. A hare sat on the edge of this, with her fore-feet\nin the air. She was for the moment so astonished at Hugh John's\nappearance that it was an appreciable period of time before she\nturned, and with a quick, sidelong rush disappeared into the wood. He\ncould hear the soughing rush of the river below him, which took\ndifferent keys according to the thickness of the tree copses which\nwere folded about it; now singing gaily through the thin birches and\nrowans; anon humming more hoarsely through the alders; again rustling\nand whispering mysteriously through the grey shivery poplars; and,\nlast of all, coming up, dull and sullen, through the heavy oak woods,\nwhose broad leaves cover all noises underneath them as a blanket\nmuffles speech.\n\nHugh John skirted the river till he came to the stepping-stones, which\nhe crossed with easy confidence. He knew them--high, low, Jack, and\ngame, like the roofs of his father's outhouses. He could just as\neasily have gone across blindfold.\n\nThen he made his way over the wide, yellowish-grey spaces of the\ncastle island, avoiding the copses of willow and dwarf birch, and the\nsandy-bottomed \"bunkers,\" which ever and anon gleamed up before him\nlike big tawny eyes out of the dusky grey-green of the short grass.\nAfter a little the walls of the old castle rose grimly before him, and\nhe could hear the starlings scolding one another sleepily high up in\nthe crevices. A black-cap piped wistfully among the sedges of the\nwatermarsh. Hugh John had often heard that the ruin was haunted, and\ncertainly he always held his breath as he passed it. But now he was on\nduty, and, if need had been, he would that night have descended to the\ndeepest dungeon, and faced a full Banquo-board of blood-boltered\nghosts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. ENEMY'S COUNTRY.\n\n\nHe presently came to the wooden bridge and crossed it. He was now on\nthe outskirts of the town, and in enemy's country. So, more from\netiquette than precaution, he took the shelter of a wall, glided\nthrough a plantation, among the withy roots of which his foot\npresently caught in a brass \"grin,\" or rabbit's snare. Hugh John\ngrubbed it up gratefully and pocketed it. He had no objections\nwhatever to spoiling the Egyptians.\n\nHe was now in butcher Donnan's pastures, where many fore-doomed sheep,\nin all the bliss of ignorance, waited their turns to be made into\nmutton. Very anxiously Hugh John scrutinised each one. He wandered\nround and round till he had made certain that Donald was not there.\n\nAt the foot of the pasture were certain black-pitched wooden sheds set\nin a square, with a little yard like a church pew in the midst.\nSomewhere here, he knew, slept Donnan's slaughterman, and it was\npossible that in this place Donald might be held in captivity.\n\nNow it was an accomplishment of our hero's that he could bleat like\nany kind of sheep--except perhaps an old tup, for which his voice was\nas yet too shrill. In happy, idle days he had elaborated a code of\nsignals with Donald, and was well accustomed to communicating with him\nfrom his bedroom window. So now he crouched in the dusk of the hedge,\nand said \"Maa-aaa!\" in a tone of reproach.\n\nInstantly a little answering bleat came from the black sheds, a sound\nwhich made Hugh's heart beat faster. Still he could not be quite sure.\nHe therefore bleated again more pleadingly, and again there came back\nthe answer, choked and feeble indeed, but quite obviously the voice of\nhis own dear Donald. Hugh John cast prudence to the winds. He raced\nround and climbed the bars into the enclosure, calling loudly,\n\"Donald! Donald!\"\n\nBut hardly had his feet touched the ground when a couple of dogs flew\nat him from the corner of the yard, and he had scarcely time to get on\nthe top of a stone wall before they were clamouring and yelping\nbeneath him. Hugh John crouched on his \"hunkers\" (as he called the\nposture in which one sits on a wall when hostile dogs are leaping\nbelow), and seizing a large coping-stone he dropped it as heavily as\nhe could on the head of the nearer and more dangerous. A howl most\nlamentable immediately followed. Then a man's voice cried, \"Down,\nTowser! What's the matter, Grip? Sic' them! Good dogs!\"\n\nIt was the voice of the slaughterman, roused from his slumbers, and in\nfear of tramps or other midnight marauders upon his master's premises.\n\nHugh ran on all fours along the wall to the nearest point of the\nwoods, dropped over, and with a leaping, anxious heart sped in the\ndirection of home. He crossed the bridge in safety, but as he ran\nacross the island he could hear the dogs upon the trail and the\nencouraging shouts of his pursuer. The black looming castle fell\nswiftly behind him. Now he was at the stepping-stones, over which he\nseemed to float rather than leap, so completely had fear added to his\nusual strength wings of swiftness.\n\nBut at the farther side the dogs were close upon him. He was obliged\nto climb a certain low tree, where he had often sat dangling his legs\nand swinging in the branches while he allowed Prissy to read to him.\n\nThe dogs were soon underneath, and he could see them leaping upward\nwith snapping white teeth which gleamed unpleasantly through the\ndarkness. But their furious barking was promptly answered. Hugh John\ncould hear a heavy tread approaching among the dense foliage of the\ntrees. A dark form suddenly appeared in the glade and poised something\nat its shoulder.--Flash! There came a deafening report, the thresh of\nleaden drops, a howl of pain from the dogs, and both of them took\ntheir way back towards the town with not a few bird shot in their\nflanks.\n\nHugh John's heart stood still as the dark figure advanced. He feared\nit might prove to be his father. Instead it was Tom Cannon, and the\nbrave scout on the tree heaved a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Who's up there?\" cried the under-keeper gruffly; \"come down this\nmoment and show yourself, you dirty poacher, or by Heaven I'll shoot\nyou sitting!\"\n\n\"All right, Tom, I'm coming as fast as I can,\" said Hugh John,\nbeginning to clamber down.\n\n\"Heavens and earth, Master Hugh--what be you doing here? Whatever will\nmaster say?\"\n\n\"He won't say anything, for he won't know, Tom Cannon.\" said Hugh John\nconfidently.\n\n\"Oh yes, he will,\" said the keeper. \"I won't have you bringing a pack\nof dogs into my covers at twelve of the clock--blow me if I will!\"\n\n\"Well, you won't tell my father, anyway!\" said Hugh John calmly,\ndusting himself as well as he could.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the keeper indignantly.\n\n\"'Cause if you do, I'll tell where I saw you kissing Jane Housemaid an\nhour ago!\"\n\nNow this was at once a guess and an exaggeration. Hugh John had not\nseen all this, but he felt rather than knew that the permitted arm\nabout Jane Housemaid's waist could have no other culmination. Also he\nhad a vague sense that this was the most irritating thing he could say\nin the circumstances.\n\nAt any rate Tom Cannon fairly gasped with astonishment. A\ndouble-jointed word slipped between his teeth, which sounded like\n\"Hang that boy!\" At last his seething thoughts found utterance.\n\n\"You young imp of Satan--it ain't true, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right, you can tell my father that!\" said Hugh John coolly,\nfeeling the strength of his position.\n\nTom Cannon was not much frightened for himself, but he did not wish to\nget Jane Housemaid into any trouble, for, as he well knew, that young\nwoman had omitted to ask for leave of absence. So he only said, \"All\nright, it's none of my business if you wander over every acre, and\nbreak your neck off every tree on the blame estate. But you'd better\nbe getting home before master comes out and catches you himself! Then\nyou'd eat strap, my lad!\"\n\nSo having remade the peace, Tom escorted Hugh John back to the dog\nkennel with great good nature, and even gave him a leg up to the roof\nabove the palace of Cæsar.\n\nHugh John paused as he put one foot into the bedroom, heavy and yet\nhomelike with the night smell of a sleeping house. Toady Lion had\nfallen out of bed and lay, still with his blanket wrapped round him\nlike a martial cloak, half under his cot and half on the floor. But\nthis he did every other night. Prissy was breathing quietly in the\nnext room. All was safe.\n\nHugh John called softly down, \"Tom, Tom!\"\n\n\"What now?\" returned the keeper, who had been spying along the top\nwindows to distinguish a certain one dear to his heart.\n\n\"I say, Tom--I'll tell Jane Housemaid to-morrow that you're a proper\nbrick.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee, sir!\" said Tom, saluting gravely and turning off across the\nlawn towards the \"bothy,\" where among the pine woods he kept his\nowl-haunted bachelor quarters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. MOBILISATION.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Hugh John despised Sammy Carter--first, because he\ncould lick him with one hand, and, secondly, because Sammy Carter was\na clever boy and could discover ways of getting even without licking\nhim. Clever boys are all cheeky and need hammering. Besides, Sammy\nCarter was in love with Prissy, and every one knew what that meant.\nBut then Sammy Carter had a sister, Cissy by name, and she was quite a\ndifferent row of beans.\n\nFurthermore, Sammy Carter read books--a degrading pursuit, unless they\nhad to do with soldiering, and especially with the wars of Napoleon,\nHugh John's great ancestor. In addition, Sammy knew every date that\nwas, and would put you right in a minute if you said that Bannockburn\nhappened after Waterloo, or any little thing like that. A disposition\nso perverse as this could only be cured with a wicket or with Hugh\nJohn's foot, and our hero frequently applied both corrections.\n\nBut Cissy Carter--ah! now there was a girl if you like. She never\ntroubled about such things. She could not run so fast as Prissy, but\nthen she had a perfect colt's mane of hair, black and glossy, which\nflew out behind her when she did. Moreover, she habitually did what\nHugh John told her, and burned much incense at his shrine, so that\nmodest youth approved of her. It was of her he first thought when he\nset about organising his army for the assault upon the Black Sheds,\nwhere, like Hofer at Mantua, the gallant Donald lay in chains.\n\nBut it was written in the chronicles of Oaklands that Cissy Carter\ncould not be allowed over the river without Sammy, so Sammy would have\nto be permitted to join too. Hugh John resolved that he would keep his\neye very sharply upon Prissy and Sammy Carter, for the abandoned pair\nhad been known to compose poetry in the heat of an engagement, and\neven to read their compositions to one another on the sly. For this\nmisdemeanour Prissy would certainly have been court-martialled, only\nthat her superior officer could not catch her at the time. But the\nwicked did not wholly escape, for Hugh John tugged her hair afterwards\ntill she cried; whereat Janet Sheepshanks, coming suddenly upon him\nand cornering him, spanked him till _he_ cried. He cried solely as a\nmeasure of military necessity, because it was the readiest way of\ngetting Janet to stop, and also because that day Janet wore a new pair\nof slippers, with heels upon which Hugh John had not been counting. So\nhe cried till he got out of Janet's reach, when he put out his tongue\nat her and said, \"Hum-m! Thought you hurt, didn't you? Well, it just\ndidn't a bit!\"\n\nAnd Sir Toady Lion, who was feeding his second-best wooden horses with\nwild sand-oats gathered green, remarked, \"When I have childwens I sail\nbeat them wif a big boot and tackets in the heel.\"\n\nWhich voiced with great precision Janet Sheepshanks' mood at that\nmoment.\n\nThe army of Windy Standard, then, when fully mustered, consisted of\nGeneral-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith, Commander-in-Chief and\nregimental Sergeant-Major (also, on occasions of parade, Big\nBig-Drummer); Adjutant-General Cissy Carter, promoted to her present\nhigh position for always agreeing with her superior officer--a safe\nrule in military politics; Commissariat-Sergeant Sir Toady Lion, who\ndeclined any other post than the care of the provisions, and had to be\nconciliated; together with Privates Sammy Carter and Prissy Smith.\nSammy Carter had formerly been Adjutant, because he had a pony, but\ngallantly resigned in order to be of the same rank as Prissy, who was\nthe sole member of the force wholly without military ambition.\n\nAt the imposing review which was held on the plains of Windy\nStandard, the Commander-in-Chief insisted on carrying the blue banner\nhimself, as well as the big-big drum, till Sammy Carter, who had not\nyet resigned, offered him his pony to ride upon. This he did with\nguile and malice aforethought, for on the drum being elevated in front\nof the mounted officer, Polo promptly ran away, and deposited\nGeneral-Field-Marshal Smith in the horse pond.\n\n[\"DEPOSITED GENERAL-FIELD-MARSHAL SMITH IN THE HORSE\nPOND.\"]\n\nBut this force, though officered with consummate ability, was\nmanifestly insufficient for the attack upon the Black Sheds. This was\nwell shown by Sammy Carter, who also pointed out that the armies of\nall ages had never been exclusively composed of those of noble birth.\nThere were, for example, at Bannockburn, the knights, the esquires,\nthe sturdy yeomanry, the spearmen, the bowmen, and the camp-followers.\nHe advised that the stable boys, Mike and Peter, should be approached.\n\nNow the head stable boy, Mike O'Donelly by name, was a scion of the\nnoblest Bourbon race. His father was an exile, who spoke the language\nwith a strong foreign accent, and drove a fish cart--which also had a\npronounced accent, reputed deadly up to fifty yards with a favourable\nwind.\n\n\"Foine frish hirrings--foive for sixpince!\" was the way he said it.\nThis proved to demonstration that he came from a far land, and was the\ndescendant of kings. When taxed directly with being the heir to a\ncrown, he did not deny it, but said, \"Yus, Masther Smith, wanst I had\na crown, but I lost it. 'Twas the Red Lion, bad scran to ut, that did\nthe deed!\"\n\nNow this was evidently only a picturesque and regal way of referring\nto the bloody revolution by which King Michael O'Donowitch had been\ndethroned and reduced to driving a fish-cart--the old, old story,\ndoubtless, of royal license and popular ingratitude. But there was no\nsuch romantic mystery about Peter Greg. He was simply junior stable\nboy, and his father was general utility man--or, as it was more\ngenerally called, \"odd man,\" about the estate of Windy Standard. Peter\noccupied most of his time in keeping one eye on his work and the other\non his father, who, on general utility principles, \"welted\" him every\ntime that he caught him. This exercise, and his other occupation of\nperpetual fisticuffs with Prince Mike O'Donelly, had so developed his\nmuscles and trained his mind, that he could lick any other two boys of\nhis size in the parish. He said so himself, and he usually had at\nleast one black eye to show for it. So no one contradicted him, and,\nindeed, who had a better right to know?\n\nPrince Michael O'Donowitch (the improvement in style was Sammy\nCarter's) put the matter differently. He said, \"I can lick Peter Greg\ntill he can't stand\" (\"shtand\" was how the royal exile pronounced it),\n\"but Peter an' me can knock the stuffin' out of any half-dozen\nspalpeens in this dirthy counthry.\"\n\nBoth Mike and Peter received commissions in the army at the same\nmoment. The ceremony took place at the foot of the great hay mow at\nthe back of the stable yard. In view of his noble ancestry, Prince\nMichael O'Donowitch was made a major-general, and Peter a lieutenant\nof marines. The newly appointed officers instantly clinched, fell\nheadlong, rolled over and over one another, pommelled each other's\nheads, bit, scratched, and kicked till the hay and straw flew in all\ndirections.\n\nWhen the dust finally cleared away, Peter was found sitting astride of\nPrince Michael, and shouting, \"Are you the general-major, or am I?\"\n\nThen when they had risen to their feet and dusted themselves, it was\nfound that the distinguished officers had exchanged commissions, and\nthat Peter Greg had become major-general, while Prince Michael\nO'Donowitch was lieutenant of marines, with a new and promising black\neye!\n\n[\"GENERALS OF DIVISION, EQUAL IN RANK.\"]\n\nBut at the first drill, upon General Peter issuing some complicated\norder, such as \"Attention! eyes right!\" Lieutenant O'Donowitch\nremarked, \"Me eyes is as roight as yours, ye dirthy baste av a\nScotchy!\" Whereupon, as the result of another appeal to arms, the\nformer judgment was reversed, and Prince Michael regained his\ncommission at the price of another black eye. Indeed he would have had\nthree, but for the fact that the number of his eyes was somewhat\nstrictly limited to two.\n\nNow it was felt by all parties that in a well-disciplined army such\ntransitions were altogether too sudden, and so a compromise was\nsuggested--as usual by Sammy Carter. Prince Michael and Peter Greg\nwere both made generals of division, equal in rank, under\nField-Marshal Smith. The division commanded by General Peter was\ncomposed of Cissy and Sir Toady Lion. The command of this first\ndivision proved, however, to be purely nominal, for Cissy was much too\nintimate with the Commander-in-Chief to be ordered about, and as for\nToady Lion he was so high minded and irresponsible that he quite\ndeclined to obey anybody whatsoever. Still, the title was the thing,\nand \"the division of General Peter Greg\" sounded very well.\n\nThe other division was much more subordinate. Prissy and Sammy Carter\nwere the only genuine privates, and they were quite ready to be\ncommanded by General Mike, Prissy upon conscientious non-resistance\nprinciples, and Sammy with a somewhat humorous aside to his\nfellow-soldier that it wouldn't be very bad, because Mike's father\n(the royal fish-hawker) lived on Sammy's ancestral domain, and owed\nmoney to Mr. Davenant Carter.\n\nThus even the iron discipline of a British army is tempered to the\nsacred property holder.\n\nThe immediate advance of the army of Windy Standard upon the Black\nSheds was only hindered by a somewhat serious indisposition which\nsuddenly attacked the Commander-in-Chief. The facts were these.\n\nAttached to the castle, but lying between it and the stepping-stones\non the steep side of the hill, was an ancient enclosed orchard. It had\ndoubtless been the original garden of the fortress, but the trees had\ngone back to their primitive \"crabbiness\" (as Hugh John put it), and\nin consequence the children were forbidden to eat any of the fruit--an\norder which might just as well not have been issued. But on a day it\nwas reported to Janet Sheepshanks that Prissy and Hugh John were in\nthe crab orchard. On tip-toe she stole down to catch them. She caught\nHugh John. Prissy was up in one of the oldest and leafiest trees, and\nHugh John, as in honour bound, persistently made signals in another\ndirection to distract attention, as he was being hauled off to condign\npunishment.\n\nHe had an hour to wait in the study for his father, who was away at\nthe county town. During this time Hugh John suffered strange qualms,\nnot of apprehension, which presently issued in yet keener and more\ndefinitely located agony. At last Mr. Picton Smith entered.\n\n\"Well, sir, and what is this I hear?\" he said severely, throwing down\nhis riding-whip on the couch as if he meant to pick it up again soon.\n\nHugh John was silent. He saw that his father knew all there was to\nknow about his evil doings from Janet Sheepshanks, and he was far too\nwise to plead guilty.\n\n\"Did I not tell you not to go to the orchard?\"\n\nHugh John hung his head, and made a slight grimace at the pattern on\nthe carpet, as a severer pang than any that had gone before assailed\nhim.\n\n\"Now, look here, sir,\" said his father, shaking his finger at him in a\nsolemnising manner, \"If ever I catch you again in that orchard,\nI'll--I'll give you as sound a thrashing, sir, as ever you got in your\nlife.\"\n\nHugh John rubbed his hand across his body just above the second lowest\nbutton of his jacket.\n\n\"Oh, father,\" he said plaintively, \"I wish dreadfully that you had\ncaught me before the last time I was in the orchard.\"\n\nThe treatment with pills and rhubarb which followed considerably\nretarded the operations of the army of Windy Standard. It was not the\nfirst time that the stomach of a commander-in-chief has had an\nappreciable effect on the conduct of a campaign.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE ARMY OF WINDY STANDARD.\n\n\nAt last, however, all was ready, in the historical phrase of Napoleon\nthe Little, \"to the last gaiter-button.\"\n\nIt was the intention of the Commander-in-Chief to attack the citadel\nof the enemy with banners flying, and after due notice. He had been\npractising for days upon his three-key bugle in order to give the call\nof Childe Roland. But Private Sammy Carter, who was always sticking\nhis oar in, put him upon wiser lines, and (what is more) did it so\nquietly and suggestively that General Napoleon was soon convinced that\nSammy's plan was his own, and on the second day boasted of its merits\nto its original begetter, who did not even smile. The like has\nhappened in greater armies with generals as distinguished.\n\nSammy Carter advised that the assault should be delivered between\neight and nine in the morning, for the very good reasons that at that\nhour both the butcher's apprentice, Tommy Pratt, and the slaughterman\nwould be busy delivering the forenoon orders, while the butcher's son,\nNipper Donnan, would be at school, and the Black Sheds consequently\nentirely deserted.\n\nAt first Hugh John rebelled, and asserted that this was not a\nsportsmanlike mode of proceeding, but Sammy Carter, who always knew\nmore about everything than was good for anybody, overwhelmed his chief\nwith examples of strategies and surprises from the military history of\nthirty centuries.\n\n\"Besides,\" said he, somewhat pertinently, \"let's get Donald back\nfirst, and then we can be chivalrous all you want. Perhaps they are\nkeeping him to fatten him up for the Odd Coons' Bank Holiday Feast.\"\n\nThis, as the wily Sammy knew, was calculated to stir up the wrath of\nhis general more than anything else he could say. For at the annual\nBean Feast of the Honourable Company of Odd Coons, a benefit secret\nsociety of convivial habits, a sheep was annually roasted whole. It\nsaid an ox on the programme, but the actual result, curiously enough,\nwas mutton and not beef.\n\n\"We attack to-morrow at daybreak,\" said Field-Marshal Smith grandly,\nas soon as Sammy Carter had finished speaking.\n\nThis, however, had subsequently to be modified to nine o'clock, to\nsuit the breakfast hour of the Carters. Moreover Saturday was\nsubstituted for Tuesday, both because Cissy and Sammy could most\neasily \"shirk\" their governess on that day, and because Mr. Picton\nSmith was known to be going up to London by the night train on Friday.\n\nOn such trivial circumstances do great events depend.\n\nWhen the army was finally mustered for the assault, its armament was\nfound to be somewhat varied, though generally efficient. But then even\nin larger armies the weapons of the different arms of the service are\nfar from uniform. There are, for example, rifles and bayonets for the\nLine, lances for the Light Horse, carbines, sabres, and army biscuits,\nall deadly after their kind.\n\nSo it was in the campaigning outfit of the forces of Windy Standard.\nThe historian can only hint at this equipment, so strange were the\nvarious kits. The Commander-in-Chief wished to insist on a red sash\nand a long cut-and-thrust sword, with (if possible) a kettle-drum. But\nthis was found impracticable as a general order. For not only did the\ntwo divisional commanders decline to submit to the sash, but there\nwere not enough kettle-drums intact to go more than half round.\n\nSo General Smith was the only soldier who carried a real sword. He had\nalso a pistol, which, however, obstinately refused to go off, but\nformed a valuable weapon when held by the barrel. Cissy was furnished\nwith a pike, constructed by Prince Michael's father, the dethroned\nmonarch of O'Donowitch-dom, out of a leister or fish-spear--which,\nstrangely enough, he had carried away with him from his palace at the\ntime of his exile. This constituted a really formidable armament,\nbeing at least five feet long, and so sharp that if you ran very hard\nagainst a soft wooden door with it, it made a mark which you could see\nquite a yard off in a good light.\n\nPrissy had a carpet-broom with a long handle, which at a distance\nlooked like a gun, and as Prissy meant to do all her fighting at a\ndistance this was quite sufficient. In addition she had three pieces\nof twine to tie up her dress, so that she would be ready to run away\nuntrammelled by flapping skirts. Sir Toady Lion was equipped for war\nwith a thimble, three sticky bull's-eyes, the haft of a knife (but no\nblade), a dog-whistle, and a go-cart with one shaft, all of which\nproved exceedingly useful.\n\nThe two Generals of Division were attired in neat stable clothes with\nbuttoned leggings, and put their trust in a pair of \"catties\"\n(otherwise known as catapults), two stout shillelahs, the national\nbatons of the exiled prince, manufactured by himself; and, most\nvaluable of all, a set a-piece of horny knuckles, which they had kept\nin constant practice against each other all through the piping times\nof peace. Both Mike and Peter knowingly chewed straws in opposite\ncorners of their mouths.\n\nThe forces on the other side were quite unknown, both as to number and\nquality. Hugh John maintained that there were at least twenty, and\nToady Lion stoutly proclaimed that there were a million thousand, and\nthat he had seen and counted them every one. But a stricter census,\ninstituted upon evidence led by Private Sammy Carter, could not get\nbeyond half-a-dozen. So that the disproportion was not so great as\nmight have been supposed. Still the siege of the Sheds was felt to be\nof the nature of a forlorn hope.\n\nIt was arranged that all who distinguished themselves for deeds of\nvalour were to receive the Victoria Cross, a decoration which had been\ncut by Hugh John out of the tops of ginger-beer bottles with a cold\nchisel. As soon, however, as Sir Toady Lion heard this, he sat down in\nthe dust of the roadside, and simply refused to budge till his\ngrievances were redressed.\n\n\"I wants Victowya Cyoss _now_!\" he remarked, with his father's wrinkle\nof determination between the eyes showing very plain, as it always did\nwhen he wanted anything very much.\n\nFor when Toady Lion asked for a thing, like the person in the\nadvertisement, he saw that he got it.\n\nIn vain it was pointed out to him that this ill-advised action\nconstituted rank mutiny, and that he was liable to be arrested, tried\nby court-martial, and ignominiously shot. Toady Lion knew all about\nmutiny, and cared nothing about courts-martial. Besides, he had had\nsome experience, and he knew the value of \"making oneself a nuisance\"\nin army matters.\n\nEqually in vain was Sammy Carter's humorously false information that\nhe had better run, for here was Janet coming up the road with an awful\nbiggy stick.\n\n\"Don't care for Janet,\" reiterated Toady Lion. \"I wants Victowya\nCyoss--I wants it _now!_\"\n\nSo there upon the roadside, at the very outset of the campaign, Sir\nToady Lion was decorated with the much coveted \"For Valour\" cross.\n\nAnd he would be a bold man who would say that he did not deserve it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE BATTLE OF THE BLACK SHEDS.\n\n\nThis much being settled, the army of Windy Standard advanced upon the\nenemy's entrenchments.\n\nPrissy was the only soldier in the force with any religious\nconvictions of a practical kind. On this occasion she actually wanted\nto send a mission to the foe with an offer of peace, on condition of\ntheir giving up Donald to his rightful owners. She instanced as an\nexample of the kind of thing she meant, the verses about turning the\nother cheek. But General Napoleon had his answer ready.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"that's all right. That's in the Bible, so I s'pose\nyou have got to believe it. But I was looking at it last Sunday in\nsermon time, and it doesn't say what you are to do _after_ you turn\nthe other cheek. So yesterday I tried it on Tommy Pratt to see how it\nworked, and he hit me on the other cheek like winking, and made my\neyes water. So then I took off my coat, and, Jove!--didn't I just give\nhim Billy-O! Texts aren't so bad. They are mostly all right, if you\nonly read on a bit!\"\n\n\"But,\" said Prissy, \"perhaps you forgot that a soft answer turneth\naway wrath?\"\n\n\"Don't, nother,\" contradicted Sir Toady Lion, whose pronunciation of\n\"wrath\" and \"horse\" was identical, and who persistently misunderstood\nthe Scriptural statement which Janet Sheepshanks had once made him\nlearn without explanation. \"Tried soft answer on big horse in the\nfarm-yard, yesterday, and he didn't turn away a little bit, but comed\nright on, and tried to eat me _all_ up!\"\n\nToady Lion always had at least one word in italics in each sentence.\n\nPrissy looked towards her ally and fellow-private for assistance.\n\n\"Love your----\" suggested Sammy, giving her a new cue. Prissy thanked\nhim with a look.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"at least you won't deny that it says in the New\nTestament that you are to love your enemies!\"\n\n\"I don't yike the New Test'ment,\" commented Toady Lion in his shrill\nhigh pipe, which cuts through all other conversation as easily as a\nsharp knife cleaves a bar of soap; \"ain't never nobody killed dead in\nthe New Test'ment!\"\n\n\"Hush, Arthur George,\" said Prissy in a shocked voice, \"you must not\nspeak like that about the New Testament. It says 'Love your enemies!'\n'Do good to them that hate you!' Now then!\"\n\nHugh John turned away with a disgusted look on his face.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"of course, if you were to go on like that, there would\nnever be any soldiers, nor bloody wars, nor nothing nice!\"\n\nWhich of course would be absurd.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring this discussion the two Generals of Division had been wholly\nsilent. To them the New Testament was considerably outside the sphere\nof practical politics. Peter Greg indeed had one which he had got from\nhis mother on his birthday with his name on the first page; and Mike,\nwho was of the contrary persuasion as to the advisability of\ncirculating the Written Word in the vulgar tongue, could always\nprovoke a fight by threatening to burn it, to which Peter Greg\ninvariably replied by a hasty and ungenerous expression of hope as to\nthe future welfare of the head of the Catholic religion.\n\nBut all this was purely academical discussion. Neither of them knew\nnor cared one jot about the matter. Prissy alone was genuinely\ndistressed, and so affected was she that two big tears of woe trickled\ndown her cheeks. These she wiped off with her pinafore, turning away\nher eyes so that Hugh John might not see them. There was, however, no\ngreat danger of this, for that warrior preoccupied himself with\nshouting \"Right-left, Right-left,\" as if he were materially assisting\nthe success of the expedition by doing so.\n\nAt the entrance to the pastures tenanted by butcher Donnan, the army\ndivided into its two divisions under their several commanders. The\nCommander-in-Chief placed himself between the wings as a central\ndivision all by himself. It was Peter Greg who first reached the door,\nand with his stout cudgel knocked off the padlock. He had already\nentered in triumph, and was about to be followed by his soldiery, when\na loud shout was heard from the edge of the park.\n\n\"Here they are--go at them! Give them fits, boys! We'll learn them to\ncome sneaking into our field.\"\n\nAnd over the stone dikes, from the direction of the town of Edam, came\nan overpowering force of the enemy led by Nipper Donnan. They seemed\nto arrive from all parts at once, and with sticks and stones they\nadvanced upon the slender array of the forces of Windy Standard. Their\nrude language, their threatening gestures, and their loud shouts\nintimidated but did not daunt the assailants. Field-Marshal Napoleon\nSmith called on his men to do or die; and everyone resolved that that\nwas just what they were there for--all except Prissy, who promptly\npulled up her skirts and went down the meadow towards the\nstepping-stones like a jenny-spinner driven by the wind, and Sir Toady\nLion, who, finding an opening in the hedge about his size in holes,\ncrept quietly through and was immediately followed by Cæsar, the\n\"potwalloping\" Newfoundland pup.\n\nThe struggle which raged around those who remained staunch to the\ncolours was grim and deadly. General-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith\nthrew himself into the thickest of the fray, and the cry, \"A Smith for\nMerry England,\" alternated with the ringing \"Scotland for ever!\" which\nhad so often carried terror into the hearts of the foe. Prince Michael\nO'Donowitch performed prodigies of valour, and personally \"downed\"\nthree of the enemy with his national weapon. Peter Greg fought a\npitched battle with Nipper Donnan, in which double-jointed words were\nas freely used as tightly clenched fists. Cissy Carter \"progged\" at\nleast half-a-dozen of the enemy with her pike, before it was wrested\nfrom her by the united efforts of several town lads who were not going\nto stand being punched by a girl. Sammy Carter stood well out of the\nheady fray, and contented himself with stinging up the enemy with his\nvengeful catapult till they howled again.\n\n[\"THE BATTLE OF THE BLACK SHEDS.\"]\n\nBut the struggle of the many against the few, the strong against the\nweak, could only end in one way. In ten minutes the forces of law and\ndisorder were scattered to the four quarters of heaven, and the\nstandard that had streamed so rarely on the braes of Edam was in the\nhands of the exulting foe.\n\nPrince Michael was wounded on the nose to the effusion of blood,\nGeneral Peter Greg was a fugitive with a price on his head, and, most\nterrible of all--Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith was taken prisoner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Sir Toady Lion was neither among the slain, nor yet among the\nwounded or the captives. What then of Toady Lion?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. TOADY LION PLAYS A FIRST LONE HAND.\n\n\nSir Toady Lion had played a lone hand.\n\nWe left him sitting behind the hedge, secure as the gods above the\nturmoil of battle. But he could not be content to stay there. He\nthought of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, his great namesake and hero; and\nthough he wanted to do nothing rash, he was resolved to justify the\nginger-beer label Victoria Cross which he wore so proudly on his\nbreast. So he waited till the forces of the town had swept those of\nWindy Standard from the field. He saw on the edge of the wood Hugh\nJohn, resisting manfully to the death, and striking out in all\ndirections. But Toady Lion knew that he had no clear call to such very\nactive exertions.\n\nCautiously he returned through his hole in the hedge, and crawling\nround the opposite side of the Black Sheds, he entered the door which\nPeter Greg had forced with his cudgel, before he had been interrupted\nby the arrival of the enemy. Toady Lion ran through a slippery byre in\nwhich calves had been standing, and came to an inner division with a\nlow door and a causewayed floor like a pig-pen. He opened this gate by\nkicking up the hasp with the toe of his boot, and found himself at\nonce in the inmost sanctuary.\n\nAnd there, right before him, with a calf's halter of rope about his\nneck, all healthy and alive, was Donald, his own dear, black, pet lamb\nDonald, who gave a little bleat of pure delight upon seeing him, and\npulled vigorously at the rope to get loose.\n\n\"Quiet now, Donald! Or they will come back. Stand still, 'oo horrid\nlittle beast 'oo, till I get the rope off!\"\n\nAnd so, easing the noose gradually, Toady Lion slipped it over\nDonald's head and he was free.\n\nThen, very cautiously, his deliverer put his head round the door to\nsee that the coast was clear. Not a soul was to be seen anywhere on\nthe pastures; so Toady Lion slid out and made for the gap in the\nhedge, sure that Donald would follow him. Donald did follow, but, as\nluck would have it, no sooner was he through than Cæsar, who had been\nscraping for imaginary rabbits at the other side of the field, came\nbarking and rushing about over the grass like a runaway traction\nengine.\n\nNow Donald hated big dogs--they rugged and tugged his wool so; as soon\ntherefore as he saw Cæsar he took down the lea towards the island as\nhard as he could go. He thundered across the wooden bridge, breaking\nthrough the fleeing forces of Windy Standard, which were scattered\nathwart the castle island. He sprinted over the short turf by the\norchard, Cæsar lying off thirty yards on his flank. At the shallows by\nthe stepping-stones Donald sheepfully took the water, and was not long\nin swimming to the other side, the Edam being hardly deep enough\nanywhere at this point to take him off his feet. In a minute more he\nwas delightedly nuzzling his wet nose into the hand of Janet\nSheepshanks, on the terrace of Windy Standard House.\n\n\"Wi beast, whaur hae ye come frae?--I declare I am _that_ glad to see\nye!\"\n\nBut had she known the price which had been paid for Donald's liberty,\nher rejoicing would quickly have given place to sorrow. It was\nmid-afternoon on the day of battle and defeat when Toady Lion\nstraggled home, so wet and dirty that he could only be slapped, bathed\nand sent to bed--which, in the absence of his father, was felt to be\nan utterly inadequate punishment.\n\nPrissy had long ago fled home with a terrible tale of battle, murder,\nand sudden death. But she knew nothing of her brother Hugh John,\nthough she had nerved herself to go back to the Black Sheds, suffering\ngrinding agonies of fear and apprehension the while, as also of\nreproach for deserting him in his hour of need. Mike and Peter were\nquietly at work in the stable, in momentary dread of being called upon\nto give evidence.\n\nThe Carters, Sammy and Cissy, had run straight home, and were at that\nmoment undoubtedly smelling of arnica and slimy with vaseline.\nBut there was no trace of the Commander-in-Chief anywhere.\nGeneral-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith had vanished from the face of the\nearth.\n\n[\"OH, THE BONNY LADDIE!\"]\n\nTea-time came and went. He had been known to be absent from tea.\nSupper-time arrived and overpassed, and then the whole house grew\nanxious. Ten o'clock came, and in the clear northern twilight all the\nhousehold were scattered over the countryside seeking for him.\nMidnight, and no Hugh John! Where could he be? Drowned in the Edam\nWater--killed by a chance blow in the great battle--or simply hiding\nfrom fear of punishment and afraid to venture home? It must have been\nsome stranger entirely unacquainted with General Napoleon Smith who\nadvocated the last explanation. The inmates of Windy Standard\ncherished no such foolish hopes.\n\nThe sun rose soon after two on as glorious a summer morning as ever\nshone upon the hills of the Border. As his beams overshot Brown\nGattonside to the east they fell on Janet Sheepshanks. Her decent\nwhite cap was green-moulded with the moss of the woods; the drip of\nwaterside caves had grimed it, the cobwebs of murky outhouses\nfestooned it. Her abundant grey hair hung down in untended witch\nlocks. She had not shut an eye nor lain down all night.\n\nNow she leaned her head on her hands and sobbed aloud.\n\n\"Oh, the bonny laddie! Whatever will I say to his faither when he\ncomes hame? His auldest son and the aipple o' his e'e! My certie, if\nthe ill-set loon were to come up the road the noo, I wad thresh the\nvery skin aff his banes! To think that he should bide awa' like this.\nOh, the dear, dear lamb that he is; and will thae auld e'en never mair\nrest on his bonnie face? Cauld, cauld noo it looks up frae the bottom\no' some pool in the Edam Water!\"\n\nAnd Janet Sheepshanks, like one of the mothers in Ramah, lifted up her\nvoice and wept with the weeping which will not be comforted; for\noft-times bairns' play brings that which is not bairns' play to those\nwho love them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE SMOUTCHY BOYS.\n\n\nGeneral Napoleon Smith had been taken captive by the Comanche Cowboys.\nNow it is fair to say in this place that they also had their side of\nthe question. Their fathers were, in their own opinion, striving for\nthe ancient rights of the town against an interloping Smith. Why\nshould not they against the son of that Smith and his allies? The\ndenunciations of the Edam Town Council were only transformed into the\nblows which rained down so freely upon Hugh John's bare and curly\nhead, as he stood at bay that Saturday morning in the corner of the\ndike.\n\n\"Surrender!\" cried Nipper Donnan, whose father had moved that the town\nof Edam take the case up to the House of Lords.\n\n\"'A Smith dies but does not surrender'!\" replied the son of the man\nwho had declared his intention of fighting the matter out though it\ntook his last copper.\n\nIn the calm atmosphere of the law-courts this was very well, and the\ncombatants stood about an equal chance; but not so when translated\ninto terms to suit the Black Sheds of Edam and the links of the castle\nisland.\n\nSo the many-headed swarmed over the wall from behind; they struck down\nthe last brave defender of privilege, and Hugh John Picton Smith was\nborne away to captivity.\n\nNow there are many tongues and many peoples on the face of the earth,\nand doubtless the one Lord made them all. But there is one variety\nwhich appears among all nations, and commentators disagree as to what\nparticular Power is responsible for his creation. He is the Smoutchy\nBoy.\n\nThis universal product of the race is indeed the chief evidence that\nwe are lineally connected with the brutes that perish; for there is no\ndoubt that the Smoutchy Boy is a brute among brutes. He is at once\ncruel and cowardly, boastful and shy, ready to strike a weaker, and\nequally ready to cry out when a stronger strikes him. He is not\npeculiar to any one class of society. He frequents the best\npublic-schools, and is responsible for the under-current of cruelty\nwhich ever and anon rises to the surface there and supplies a month's\nfree copy to enterprising journals in want of a sensation for the dull\nseason. He makes some regiments of the service a terror. He\nunderstands all about \"hazing\" in the navy. Happily, however, among\nsuch large collections of human beings there is generally some\nclear-eyed, upstanding, able-bodied, long-armed Other Product who, by\nway of counterpoise, has been specially created to be the defender of\nthe oppressed, and the scourge of the Smoutchy Boy.\n\nI have seen one such scatter a dozen Smoutchies, who were employed\nafter their kind in stoning to death a nestful of fluffy, gaping,\nyellow-billed young blackbirds. I have heard the sound of his fists\nstriking most compactly and satisfactorily against Smoutchy flesh.\nAlso I know the jar with which a foot stops suddenly in mid-air, as\nthe Scourge pursues and kicks the fleeing Smoutchy--kicks him \"for\nkeeps\" too.\n\nYet for all this Smoutchy Boy is a man and a brother. His smoutchiness\ngenerally passes off with the callowness of hobble-de-hoyhood. The\ncondition is indeed rather one for the doctor than for the Police\nCourt. It is pathological rather than criminal; for when the Smoutchy\nis thrown for some time into the society of men of the world--drilled\nfor instance in barrack yards, licked and clouted into shape by the\nregiment or the ship's crew, he sheds his smoutchiness from him like a\ngarment. It is on record that Smoutchies ere now have led forlorn\nhopes, pierced Africa to its centre, navigated strange seas, and\ntrodden trackless Polar snows. The worst Smoutchy of my time, the\nbully who, till the biceps and _tendo Achilles_ muscles hardened to\ntheir office, made life at a certain school a terror and an agony,\nafterwards sprang from a steamer in order to save the life of a man\nwho had fallen overboard in a high-running sea.\n\n[\"THE HEAD SMOUTCHY.\"]\n\nBut of all Smoutchies the worst variety is that reared in the vicinity\nof the small manufacturing town. He thrives on wages too early and too\neasily earned. Foul language, a tobacco pipe with the bowl turned\ndown, and the rotten fagends of Association football, are the signs by\nwhich you may know him. In such a society there is always one Smoutchy\nwho sets the fashion, and a crowd who imitate.\n\nIn Edam the head Smoutchy of the time was Nipper Donnan. He was the\nson of a fighting butcher, who in his day, and before marrying the\nwidow of the deceased publican of the \"Black Bull,\" had been a yet\nmore riotous drover, and had almost met the running expenses of the\nSheriff Court by his promptly paid fines.\n\nThe only things Nipper Donnan feared were the small, round, deep-set\neyes of his father. The police were a sport to him. The\nwell-brought-up children of the Grammar School trembled at his name.\nThe rough lads at work in the mills on the Edam Water almost\nworshipped him; for it was known that his father gave him lessons in\npugilism. He sported a meerschaum pipe; a spotted handkerchief was\nalways knotted knowingly round his throat, and a white bull-dog, with\nred sidelong eyes and lips drawn up at the corners, followed close at\nhis heel.\n\nGreat in Edam and on all the banks of the Edam Water was Nipper\nDonnan, the King of the Smoutchies.\n\nAnd it was into his hard, rough, unclean hands that our brave General\nNapoleon had fallen. Now Nipper had been reared in special hatred of\nthe Smiths of Windy Standard. Mr. Picton Smith it was who, long ago at\nEdam Fair, as a young man, had interfered with Drover Donnan, when he\nwas just settling to \"polish off\" a soft, good-natured shepherd of the\nhills, whom he had failed to cheat out of the price of his\n\"blackfaces.\" Mr. Picton Smith it was who on the same occasion had\nsentenced the riotous drover to \"thirty days without the option of a\nfine.\" He it was in times more recent who had been the means of\ngetting the Black Bull shut up, upon the oft-repeated complaint of the\nChief Constable.\n\nAnd so all this heritage of hatred was now to be worked off on the son\nof the gentleman by the son of the bully. Of course it might just as\nwell have been the other way about, for there is no absolute heredity\nin Smoutchydom. The butcher might easily have been the gentleman, and\nthe landlord's son the Smoutchy bully; only to Hugh John's cost, on\nthis occasion it happened to be the other way about.\n\nThe lads who followed Nipper Donnan were mostly humble admirers--some\nmore cruel, some less, but sworn Smoutchies to a man, and all afraid\nto interfere with the fierce pleasures of their chief. Indeed, so\nabsolute was Captain Nipper Donnan, that there never was a time when\nsome of his band did not bear the marks of his attentions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. BEFORE THE INQUISITION.\n\n\nWith this excursion into the natural history of the Smoutchy Boy,\nwhich perhaps ought to have come somewhat earlier in the history, we\ncontinue the tale of the adventures of General Napoleon Smith.\n\nBeaten down by numbers, the hero lay on the ground at the corner of\nthe butcher's parks. Nipper Donnan stood over him and held him down\nwith his foot. They were just the right ages for bully and bullied.\nHugh John Smith was twelve, slim, and straight as an arrow; Nipper\nDonnan sixteen, short, hard, and thick set, with large solid hands and\nprominent knuckles.\n\n\"Got you at last, young prig! Now I'll do you to rights!\" remarked\nNipper, genially kicking Hugh John in the ribs with his hobnailed\nboots.\n\nHugh John said not a word, for he had fought till there was no more\nbreath left in him anywhere.\n\n\"Sulky, hey?\" said Nipper, with another kick in a more tender spot.\nHugh John winced. \"Ah, lads, I thought that would wake the young swell\nup. Oh, our father is the owner of this property, is he? So nice! He\nowns the town, does he? Nasty pauper he is! Too poor to keep a proper\ncarriage, but thinks us all dirt under his feet. Yaw, yaw, we aw-w so\nfine, we aw-w, we a-aw!\"\n\nAnd Nipper Donnan imitated, amid the mean obsequious laughter of his\nfighting tail, the erect carriage of his father's enemy, Mr. Picton\nSmith, as he was accustomed to stride somewhat haughtily down the High\nStreet of Edam.\n\nThen he came back and kicked Hugh John again.\n\n\"You wouldn't dare to do this if my father were here!\" said General\nNapoleon, now sitting up on his elbow.\n\n\"_Your_ father, I'll show you!\" shouted furiously Nipper the Tyrant.\n\"Who asked you to come here anyway to meddle with us? Who invited you\ninto our parks? What business have you in our castle? Fetch him along,\nboys; we'll show him something that neither he nor his father know\nanything about. They and the likes of them used to shut up people in\nthe castle dungeons, so they say. We are just the boys to give 'em a\ntaste of what it is like theirselves.\"\n\n\"Hooray,\" shouted the Smoutchy fighting tail; \"fetch him along, lads!\"\n\nSo with no gentle hands Hugh John was seized and hurried away. He was\ntouched up with ironbound clogs in the rear, his arms were pinched\nunderneath where the skin is tender, as well as nearly dragged from\ntheir sockets. A useless red cravat was thrust into his mouth by way\nof a gag--useless, for the prisoner would sooner have died than have\nuttered one solitary cry.\n\nAnd all the time Hugh John was saying over and over to himself the\nconfession of his faith:\n\n\"I'm glad I didn't tell--I'm glad I wasn't 'dasht-mean.' I'm a\nsoldier. The Scots Greys saluted me; and these fellows _shan't_ make\nme cry.\"\n\nAnd they didn't. For the spirit of many generations of stalwart Smiths\nand fighting Pictons was in him, and perhaps also a spark from the\nancestral anvil of the first Smith had put iron into his boyish blood.\nSo all through the scene which followed--the slow mock trial, the\nsmall ingenious tortures, pulling back middle fingers, hanging up by\nthumbs to a beam with his toes just touching the ground, tying a\nstring about his head and tightening it with a twisted stick--Hugh\nJohn never cried a tear, which was the bitterest drop in the cup of\nNipper Donnan.\n\nThey removed the gag in order that they might question him.\n\n\"Say this is not your father's castle, and we'll let you down!\" cried\nNipper.\n\n\"It _is_ my father's and nobody else's! And when it is mine, I shan't\nlet one of you beasts come near it.\"\n\nThe Smoutchies tried another tack.\n\n\"Promise you won't tell on us if we let you go!\"\n\n\"I shan't promise; I will tell every one of your names to the\npoliceman, and get you put in jail--so there! My father has gone to\nLondon to see the Queen, and have you all put into prison--yes, and\nwhipped with a cat-o'-nine-tails as soon as ever he comes back!\"\nanswered Hugh John, shamelessly belying both his father and his own\nintentions.\n\nBut he comforted himself and excused the lie, by saying to himself,\n\"It is none of their business whether I tell on them or not. They\nshan't think that I don't tell because I am afraid of them!\"\n\nAnd the great heart of the hero (aged twelve) stood high and unshaken.\n\nAt last even Nipper Donnan tired of the cruel sport. It was no great\nfun when the victim could not be made to cry or appeal for mercy. And\neven the fighting tail grew vaguely restive, perhaps becoming\nindistinctly conscious, in spite of their blind admiration for their\nchief, that by comparison with the steadfast defiance and upright mien\nof their solitary victim, the slouching, black-pipe-smoking\nsmoutchiness of Nipper Donnan did not appear the truly heroic figure.\n\n\"Let's put him in the dungeon, and leave him there! I can come and\nlet him out after, and then kick the beggar home the way he came! That\nwill learn him to let us alone for ever and ever!\"\n\nThe fighting tail shouted agreement, and Hugh John was promptly haled\nto the mouth of the prison-house; a rope was rove about his waist, his\nhands were tied behind his back, and he was lowered down into the\nancient dungeon of the Castle of Windy Standard. This place of\nconfinement had last been used a hundred and fifty years ago for the\nstragglers of the Bonny Prince's army after the retreat northward. The\ndungeon was bottle-necked above, and spread out beneath into a\ncircular vault of thirty or forty feet in diameter. Its depth was\nabout twelve feet; and as the boys had not rope enough to lower their\nprisoner all the way, they had perforce to let Hugh John drop, and he\nlighted on his feet, taking of course the rope with him.\n\n\"Come on, lads,\" cried Nipper Donnan, \"let's go and have a smoke at\nthe Black Sheds, and then go up to the Market Hill to see the shows.\nThe proud swine will do well enough down there till his father comes\nback from London with the cat-o'-nine-tails!\"\n\nHe looked over the edge and spat into the dungeon.\n\n\"That for you!\" he cried. \"Will ye say now that the castle is your\nfather's, and that we have no right here!\"\n\nHugh John tried to give the required information as to ownership, but\nit was choked in the folds of the red cravat. Nipper went on\ntauntingly, all unchallenged.\n\n[\"'WILL YE SAY NOW THAT THE CASTLE IS YOUR FATHER'S, AND\nTHAT WE HAVE NO RIGHT HERE!' SAID NIPPER DONNAN.\"]\n\n\"There's ethers (adders) down there--and weasels and whopper rats that\neat off your fingers and toes. Yes, and my father saw a black beast\nlike an otter, but as big as a calf, run in there out of the Edam\nWater; and they'll bite ye and stang ye and suck your blood! And we\nare never coming back no more, so ye'll die of starvation besides.\"\n\nWith this pleasing speech by way of farewell and benediction, Nipper\nDonnan drew off his forces, and Hugh John was left alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE CASTLE DUNGEON.\n\n\nFor some time after Hugh John was thus imprisoned, he stood looking up\nwith a face of set defiance through the narrow aperture above, where\nhe had last seen the triumphant countenances of his foes.\n\n\"Who's afraid? They shan't say Hugh John Picton Smith is afraid!\" were\nthe words in his proud and angry heart, which kept him from feeling\ninsult and pain, kicks and buffetings. Gradually, however, as the\nsound of retreating footsteps died away, the rigid attitude of the\nhero relaxed. He began to be conscious that he was all one great ache,\nthat the ropes were drawn exceedingly tight about his wrists, that\nthe gag in his mouth hurt his cheeks, that he was very tired--and, oh!\nshame for a hero of battles and martyr in secret torture-chambers,\nthat he wanted badly to sit down and cry.\n\n\"But I won't cry--even to myself!\" said Hugh John. Yet all the same he\nsat mournfully down to consider his position. He did not doubt that he\nhad been left there for altogether, and he began at once (perhaps to\nkeep himself from crying) to argue out the chances.\n\n\"First,\" he said, \"I must wriggle my hands loose, then I can get the\ngag out of my mouth easy enough. After that I've got to count my\nstores, and see if I can find a rusty nail to write my name on the\nwall and the date of my captivity.\"\n\n(Hugh John wanted to do everything decently and in order.)\n\n\"Then I must find a pin or a needle (a needle if possible--a pin is\npoisonous, and besides it is so much more easy to prick blood from\nyour thumb with a needle), and then I have got to write an account of\nmy sufferings on linen like the abbé, or on tablets of bread like\nLatude. As I have no bread, except the lump that was left over at\nbreakfast, I suppose it will need to be written on linen; but bread\ntablets are much the more interesting. Of course I could make one or\ntwo tablets, write secret messages on them, and eat them after.\"\n\nGeneral Smith would have gone on to make still further arrangements\nfor the future, but the present pain of the blood in his hands and\nthe tightness of the rope at his wrists warned him that he had better\nbegin the practical work of effecting his release.\n\nNow General Smith was not one of that somewhat numerous class of\npersons who take all day to do nothing, and as soon as he was\nconvinced by indisputable logic of the wisdom of any course, he threw\nhimself heart and soul into the accomplishment of it. On his hands and\nknees he went half round the circuit of the wall of his prison, but\nencountered nothing save the bare clammy stones--with the mortar loose\nand crumbly in the joints, and the moist exudations of the lime\ncongealed into little stony blobs upon the surface which tasted\nbrackish when he put his lips to them.\n\nSo Hugh John stood up and began a new search on another level. This\ntime he did find something to the purpose.\n\nAbout three feet from the ground was a strong nail driven firmly into\na joint of the masonry. Probably it owed its position to one of the\nHighland prisoners of the Forty-five, who had used it to hang his\nspare clothes on, or for some other purpose. But in his heart Hugh\nJohn dated it from the days of the Black Douglas at least.\n\nEither way it proved most useful.\n\nStanding with his back to the wall, the boy could just reach it with\nhis wrists. He had long thin hands with bones which, when squeezed,\nseemed to have a capacity for fitting still more closely into one\nanother. So it was not difficult for him to open the palms\nsufficiently to let the head of the nail in. Then biting his teeth\nupon his lip to keep the pain at a bearable point, he bent the weight\nof his body this way and that upon the iron pin, so that in five or\nsix minutes he had worked Nipper Donnan's inartistic knots\nsufficiently loose to slip over his wrists. His hands were free.\n\n[\"HE BENT THE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY THIS WAY AND THAT.\"]\n\nHis first act was to take the red cravat out of his mouth, and the\nnext after that to lie down with all his weight upon his hands,\nholding them between the floor of the dungeon and his breast, for the\ntingling pain of the blood returning into the fingers came nearer to\nmaking the hero cry than all that had happened that day. But he still\nrefrained.\n\n\"No, I won't, I am a Napoleon--Smith!\" he added as an afterthought, as\nif in loyalty to the father, whose legal and territorial claims he had\nthat day so manfully upheld.\n\nBut suddenly what was due to his dignified position as a state\nprisoner occurred to him. Casanova had struck at the wall till his\nfingers bled. Latude had gnashed his teeth, howled with anguish, and\ngnawed the earth.\n\n\"I have not done any of these things,\" said Hugh John; \"I don't like\nit. But I suppose I've got to try!\"\n\nHowever, one solid rap of his knuckles upon the hard limestone of the\ndungeon wall persuaded him that there were things more amusing in the\nworld than to imitate Casanova in that. And as at the first gnaw his\nmouth encountered a tiny nettle, he leaped to his feet and declared at\nthe pitch of his voice that both Latude and Casanova were certainly\n\"dasht fools!\"\n\nThe sound of his own words reminded him that after all he was within a\nmile of home. He wondered what time it might be. He began to feel\nhungry, and the cubic capacity of his internal emptiness persuaded him\nthat it must be at least quite his usual dinner-time.\n\nSo Hugh John decided that, all things being considered, it would be\nnothing against his manhood if he called for help, and took his chance\nof any coming. But he remembered that the mouth of the dungeon was in\na very retired part of the castle, in the wing nearest to the river,\nand shut off from the road across the island by a flanking tower and\na thirteen-foot wall. So he was not very sanguine of success. Still he\nfelt that in his perilous position he could not afford to neglect any\nchance, however slight.\n\nSo he shouted manfully, \"Help! Help! Murder! Police! Fire!\" as loud as\nhe could bawl.\n\nThen he tried the \"Coo-ee\" which Sergeant Steel had taught him, under\nthe impression that it would carry farther. But the keep of a\nfourteenth century castle and thirteen feet of shell lime and rubble\nmasonry are proof against the most willing boyish voice in the world.\nSo General Napoleon made no more impression upon his friends than his\ngreat original would have done had he summoned the Old Guard from the\ncliffs of St. Helena.\n\nBut the younger warrior was not discouraged. He had tried one plan and\nit had failed. He sat down again to think what was the next thing to\nbe done.\n\nHe remembered the thick \"hunk\" of bread he had put in the pocket of\nhis jacket in the morning. He could not eat it at breakfast, so\ngreatly had he been excited by the impending conflict; so, to prevent\nwaste, and to make all safe, he had put it in his pocket. Besides, in\nthe absence of his father, it was not always possible to be in for\nmeals. And--well, one never knew what might happen. It was best to be\nprepared for all emergencies.\n\nWith trembling hand he felt for the \"hunk.\" Alas! the jacket pocket\nwas empty, and hung flat and limp against his side. The staff of life\nmust have fallen out in the progress of the fray, or else one of the\nenemy had despoiled him of his treasure.\n\nA quick thought struck his military mind, accustomed before all else\nto deal with questions of commissariat. It was just possible that the\nbread might have fallen out of his pocket when the Smoutchies were\nletting him down so roughly into the dungeon of the castle.\n\nHe went directly underneath the aperture, from which a faint light was\ndistributed over the uneven floor of hard trampled earth whereon a\ncentury's dry dust lay ankle deep.\n\nThere--there, almost under his feet, was his piece of bread!\n\nHugh John picked it up, blew the dust carefully off, and wiped the\nsurface with his handkerchief. It was a good solid piece of bread, and\nwould have served Cæsar the Potwalloper for at least two mouthfuls.\nWith care it might sustain life for an indefinite period--perhaps as\nmuch as twenty-four hours.\n\nSo, in accordance with the best traditions, the prisoner divided his\nprovision with his pocketknife, as accurately as possible under the\ncircumstances. He cut it into cubes of about an inch square, exactly\nas if he had been going to lay down rat poison.\n\nNapoleon Smith was decidedly beginning to recover his spirits. For one\nthing, he thought how very few boys had ever had his chances. A Latude\nof twelve was somewhat unusual in the United Kingdom of Great Britain\nand Ireland, and even in the adjacent islands. He began at once to\nwrite his memoirs in his head, but found that he could not get on very\nwell, because he could not remember which one of his various\ngreat-grandmothers had danced with Bonny Prince Charlie at Edinburgh.\nThis for a loyal prisoner was insuperable, so he gave the memoirs up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. THE DROP OF WATER.\n\n\nFrom fruitless genealogy he turned to the further consideration of his\nsupplies. He wanted water, and in a dungeon surrounded by lime-stone\nwalls and founded upon a rock, it seemed likely he would continue to\nwant it. But at the farthest corner, just where the roof approached\nmost closely to the floor, Hugh John could hear a _pat_, _pat_ at\nregularly recurring intervals. He put his hand forward into the\ndarkness, and immediately a large drop of water fell on the back of\nit. He set his tongue to it, and it tasted cool and good after the\nfustiness of the woollen gag.\n\nHugh John thrust forward his hand again, palm upwards this time, and\nwas rewarded by finding that every time he counted ten slowly a large\ndrop, like those in the van of a thunder storm, splashed into the\nhollow. It was tedious work, but then a dungeon is a slow place, and\nhe had plenty of time. He crawled forward to be nearer to the source\nof supplies, and while trying to insinuate his head sideways\nunderneath like a dog at a spout, to catch the drop in his mouth\nwithout the intervention of a warm hand, he felt that his knee was\nwet. He had inadvertently placed it in a small natural basin into\nwhich the drop had been falling for ages. Hugh John set his lips to\nit, and never did even soda-water-and-milk, that nectar of the meagre\nand uncritical gods of boyhood, taste sweeter or more refreshing.\nAfter he had taken a good solid drink he cleaned the sand from the\nbottom carefully, and there, ready to his hand, was a stone cup\nhollowed out of a projecting piece of the rock on which the castle was\nbuilt. This well-anchored drinking-cup was shaped like the\npecten-shell of pilgrimage, and set with the broad fluted end towards\nhim.\n\nThus fortified with meat and drink, for he had devoured the first of\nhis rat-poison squares, or rather bolted it like a pill, General\nNapoleon sat down to reckon up his resources. He found himself in\npossession of some ten feet of fairly good cord, which had evidently\nbeen used for bringing cattle to the fatal Black Sheds of butcher\nDonnan. The prisoner carefully worked out all the knots, in order to\nget as much length as possible. He did not, indeed, see how such a\nthing could help him to escape, but that was not his business, for in\nthe authorities a rope was always conveyed into the cell of the pining\ncaptive, generally in an enormous pie.\n\nHugh John felt that he was indeed a pining captive, but it was the pie\nand not the rope he pined for. His dungeon was downstairs, and he did\nnot see how a rope could possibly help him to get out, unless there\nwas somebody at the top of the bottle ready to haul him up.\n\nHe tried his voice again, and made the castle ring in vain. Alas! only\nthe echoes came back, the pert jackdaws cried out insolently far above\nhim and mocked him in a clamorous crowd from the ruined gables.\n\nThen his mind went off all of itself to the pleasant dining-room of\nthe house of Windy Standard, where Prissy and Sir Toady Lion would\neven now be sitting down to tea. He could smell the nice refreshing\nbouquet of the hot china pot as Janet Sheepshanks poured the tea into\nthe cups in a golden brown jet, and then \"doused\" in the cream with a\nliberal hand.\n\n\"I declare I could drink up the whole tea-pot full without ever\nstopping,\" said Hugh John aloud, and then started at the sound of his\nown voice.\n\nHe waited as long as possible, and then ate the second of his squares\nof bread. Then he drank the mouthful of water which had gathered in\nthe stone shell. While he was in there underneath the dungeon eaves,\nhe put out his hand to feel how far off the wall was. He expected\neasily to reach it, but in this he failed entirely. His hand was\nmerely stretched out into space, while the drop fell upon his head,\nand then upon his neck, as he leaned farther and farther over in his\nefforts to find a boundary wall.\n\nHe had noticed from the first that the floor immediately beneath the\ncup was quite dry all round, but it had not occurred to him before\nthat if the drop fell constantly and regularly the basin must overflow\nin some direction. Hugh John was not logical. It is true that he liked\nfinding out things by his five senses, but then that is a very\ndifferent affair. Sammy Carter tried to argue with him sometimes, and\nmake matters clear to him by pure reason. The first time Hugh John\nusually told him to \"shut it.\" The second he simply hammered the\nlogician.\n\nFinally, to solve the mystery, Hugh John crawled completely over his\ndrinking fountain and kneeled in the damp sand at the back of the\nbasin. Still he could discover no wall. Next, he put his hand forward\nas far as it would reach out, and--he _could feel no floor_.\n\nVery gingerly he put his foot over the edge, and at once found himself\non the top step of a steep, narrow, and exceedingly uneven stair. The\nexplorer's heart beat fast within him. He knew what it was now that he\nhad found--a secret passage, perhaps ending in an enchanted cave;\nperhaps (who knew) in a pirate's den. He thought of Nipper Donnan's\nlast words about the beast as big as a calf which his father had seen\ngoing down into the dungeon. It was a lie, of course; it must be,\nbecause Nipper Donnan said it; but still it was certainly very dark\nand dismal down there.\n\nHugh John listened with his ear pointed down the stair, and his mouth\nopen. He certainly did hear a low, rushing, hissing sound, which might\nbe the Edam water surrounding the old tower, or--the breathing of the\nBlack Beast.\n\nIf Hugh John had had even Toady Lion with him, he would have felt no\nfears; but to be alone in silence and darkness is fitted to shake\nstronger nerves than those of a twelve-year-old boy. It was getting\nlate, as he knew by the craving ache in his stomach, and also by the\ngradual dusking of the hole twelve feet above his head, through whose\nnarrow throat he had been let down in the forenoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow at first the Smoutchy boys had not meant to leave Hugh John in the\ndungeon all night, but only to give him a thorough fright for his\nhardihood in daring to attack their citadel. But Nipper Donnan's\nnatural resolution was ever towards cruelty of all sorts, and it was\nturned to adamant upon discovering that Donald, the captured hostage\nand original cause of conflict, had in some mysterious way escaped.\n\nThis unexpected success of the attacking party he attributed, of\ncourse, to Hugh John, whom, in spite of his youth, he well knew to be\nthe leading spirit. Sir Toady Lion was never so much as suspected--a\nfact which would have pleased that doughty warrior but little had he\nknown it.\n\nIn the afternoon Nipper had gone to Halkirk Tryst to bring home two\nbullocks, which Butcher Donnan had bought there the day before; but\nhis father becoming involved in some critical cattle-dealing\ntransaction, for which he was unable to obtain satisfaction in cash,\nresolved that Nipper should wait till the next day, when he hoped to\nbe able to accompany him home in person. So engrossed was Nipper with\nthe freaks of the fair, the Aunt-Sallies, the shooting-galleries, and\nmiscellaneous side-shows and ghost illusions, that he quite forgot all\nabout our hero immured in the dungeon of the Castle of Windy Standard.\nEven had he remembered, he would certainly have said to himself that\nsome of the other boys would be sure to go and let him out (for which\ninterference with his privileges he would assuredly punch their heads\nto-morrow!)--and that in any case it served the beggar right.\n\nProbably, however, his father (had Nipper thought fit to mention the\nmatter to him), would have taken quite a different view of the\nsituation; for the butcher, with all his detestation of the owner of\nthe Windy Standard estate, held Mr. Picton Smith in a wholesome awe\nwhich almost amounted to reverence.\n\nSo it came about that none approached the castle all that afternoon;\nfor the boys of Nipper's band were afraid to venture upon the castle\nisland in the absence of their redoubtable chief, while the servants\nof Windy Standard House sought for the vanished in quite other\ndirections, being led astray by the innocent assertions of Toady Lion,\nwho had last seen Hugh John defending himself gallantly against\noverwhelming numbers in the corner of the field nearest to the town,\nand at least half a mile as the crow flies from the castle on the\nisland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE SECRET PASSAGE.\n\n\nFor a full hour Hugh John sat on the top step of the stairs, or went\nback and forward between these and the narrow circular opening so high\nabove his head, which was now filled with a sort of ruddy haze, the\nsign that the sun was setting comfortably and sedately outside, behind\nthe smooth green hills in which the Cheviots broke down into the\nSolway Marshes. It was not so much that the boy dared not descend into\nthe secret passage. Rather he did not wish to confront the blankness\nof disappointment. The steps might lead nowhere at all. They might\ndrop off suddenly into the depths of a well.\n\nTo prove to himself that he was quite calm, and also that he was in no\nhurry, Hugh John ate the third of his bread-squares and drank the\nwater which had meantime collected in the stone shell. Heroes always\nrefreshed themselves thus before an adventure.\n\n\"'None knoweth when our lips shall touch the blessed bread again!'\nThis prog's too hanged dry for anything!\"--that was what Hugh John\nsaid, quoting (partly) from the \"Life and Death of Arthur the King.\"\n\nThen feeling that mere poetry was off and that the time for action had\ndefinitely come, he tied to his rope a large fallen stone which lay in\na corner, and crawling over the shell to the head of the steps, he\nthrew it down. It did not go far, appearing to catch in some\nprojection. He tried again with a like result. He pulled it up. The\nstone was dry. The opening was not, then, a well with water at the\nbottom.\n\nSo Hugh John cautiously put his foot upon the threshold of the secret\npassage, and commenced the perilous descent. He clutched the edge of\nthe top step as he let himself down. It was cold, wet, and clammy, but\nthe stones beneath seemed secure enough. So he continued to descend\ntill he found himself in a narrow staircase which went down and down,\ngradually twisting to the left away from the light. His heart beat\nfast, and there was a curious heavy feeling about his nostrils, which\ndoubtless came from the damp mists of a confined place so close to the\nriver.\n\nThe adventurous General had descended quite a long way when he came to\na level stone-flagged passage. He advanced twenty yards along it, and\nthen put out his hands. He found himself in a narrow cell, dripping\nwith wet and ankle deep in mud. The cell was so small, that by making\na couple of steps Hugh John could feel it from side to side. At the\nfarther end of it there was evidently a door or passage of some sort,\nbut it was blocked up with fallen stones and rubbish; yet through it\ncame the strangest muffled noises. Something coughed like a man in\npain. There was also a noise as of the feet of animals moving about\nstealthily and restlessly, and he seemed even to hear voices speaking.\n\nA wild unreasoning fear suddenly filled the boy's heart. He turned and\nfled, stumbling hastily up the stairs by which he had so cautiously\ndescended. The thought of the black beast, great as a calf, of which\nNipper Donnan had spoken, came upon him and almost mastered him. Yet\nall the time he knew that Nipper had only said it to frighten him. But\nit was now dark night, even in the upper dungeon. He was alone in a\nhaunted castle, and, as the gloaming settled down, Hugh John cordially\nagreed with Sir David Brewster, who is reputed to have said, \"I do not\nbelieve in ghosts, but I am afraid of them.\"\n\nIn spite of all his gallantry of the day, and the resolutions he had\nmade that his prison record should be strictly according to rule, Hugh\nJohn's sudden panic took complete hold of him. He sat down under the\nopening of the dungeon, and for the first time cried bitter tears,\nexcusing himself on the ground that there was no one there to see him,\nand anyway he could easily leave that part out when he came to write\nhis journal. About this time he also slipped in a surreptitious\nprayer. He thought that at least it could do no harm. Prissy had\ninduced him to try this method sometimes, but mostly he was afraid to\nlet her know about it afterwards, because it made Prissy so unbearably\nconceited. But after all this was in a dungeon, and many very\nrespectable prisoners quite regularly said their prayers, as any one\nmay see for themselves in the books.\n\n\"You see,\" said Hugh John, explanatorily afterwards, \"it's very easy\nfor them. They have nothing else to do. They haven't to wash, and take\nbaths, and comb their hair, and be ordered about! It's easy to be good\nwhen you're leading a natural life.\"\n\nThis was Hugh John's prayer, and a model for any soldier's\npocket-book.\n\n\"Our Father Witch-Charta-Nevin\" (this he considered a Christian name\nand surname, curious but quite authoritative), \"help me to get out of\nthis beastly hole. Help me to lick Nipper Donnan till he can't stand,\nand bust Sammy Carter for running away. For we are all miserable\nsinners. God bless father and Prissy, Arthur George (I wonder where\nthe little beast went to--guess he sneaked--just wait!), Janet\nSheepshanks, Mary Jane Housemaid, and everybody about the house and\ndown at the stables, except Bella Murdoch, that is a clash-bag and a\ntell-tale-tit. And make me a good boy. For Jesus' sake. Aymen.\"\n\nThat the last petition was by no means a superfluous one every reader\nof this history will agree. Hugh John very carefully said \"Ay-men\"\nnow, because he had said \"A-men\" in the morning. He noticed that his\nfather always said \"Ay-men\" very solemnly at the end of a prayer,\nwhile Prissy, who liked going to church even on week days (a low\ndodge!), insisted upon \"A-men.\" So Hugh John used \"Ay-men\" and \"A-men\"\ntime about, just to show that there was no ill-feeling. Thus early in\nlife does the leaven of Gallio (who \"cared for none of these things\")\nbegin to show itself. Hugh John was obviously going to be a very\npronounced Broad Churchman.\n\nThe prayer did the captive General much good. He was not now nearly so\nmuch afraid of the beasts. The hole did not seem to yawn so black\nbeneath him; and though he kept his ear on the cock for anything that\nmight come at him up the stairs, he could with some tolerable\ncomposure sit still and wait for the morning. He decided that so soon\nas it was even a little light, he would try again and find out if he\ncould not remove the rubbish from the further door.\n\nThe midsummer morn was not long in coming--shorter far indeed to Hugh\nJohn than to the anxious hearts that were scattered broadcast over the\nface of the country seeking for him. Scarcely had the boy sat down to\nwait for the daylight when his head sank on his breast. Presently he\nswayed gently to the side, and turning over with a contented little\nmurmur, he curled himself up like a tired puppy and went fast asleep.\nWhen he awoke, a fresher pink radiance than that of eventide filled\nthe aperture above his head--the glow of the wide, sweet, blushful\ndawn which flooded all the eastern sky outside the tall grey walls of\nthe Castle of Windy Standard.\n\nHugh John rose, stretched himself, yawned, and looked about him in\nsurprise. There was no Toady Lion in a little white ship on four iron\nlegs, moored safe alongside him; no open door through into Prissy's\nroom; no birch-tree outside the window, glimmering purest white and\ndelicatest pink in the morning light--nothing, in short, that had\ngreeted his waking eyes every morning of his life hitherto.\n\nBut there were compensations. He was a prisoner. He had endured a\nnight in a dungeon. His hair would almost certainly have turned pure\nwhite, or at least streaky. What boy of his age had ever done these\nthings since the little Dauphin, about whom he was so sorry, and over\nwhose fate he had shed such bitter tears? Had Sammy Carter? Hugh John\nsmiled a sarcastic and derisive smile. Sammy Carter indeed! He would\njust like to see Sammy Carter try it once! _He_ would have been dead\nby this time, if he had had to go through the tenth of what he (Hugh\nJohn) had undergone. Had Mike or Peter? They were big and strong. They\nsmoked pipes. But they had never been tortured, never shut up in a\ndungeon with wild beasts in the next compartment, and no hasp on the\ndoor.\n\nThe staircase--the secret passage! Hugh John's heart fluttered wildly.\nHe might even yet get back in time for breakfast. There would be\nporridge--and egg-and-bacon--oh! crikey, yes, and it was kidney\nmorning. Hugh John's mouth watered. There was no need of the cool\nfluid in the shell of limestone now! Could there indeed be such\ndainties in the world? It did not seem possible. And yet that very\nmorning--he meant the morning before--no, surely it must have been in\nsome other life infinitely remote, he had grumbled because he had not\nhad cream instead of milk to his porridge, and because the bacon was\nnot previously crisp enough. He felt that if ever he were privileged\nto taste as good bacon again, he would become religious like\nPrissy--or take some such extreme measure as that.\n\n[\"OVER THE CLOSELY PACKED WOOLLY BACKS HE SAW A STRETCH\nOF RIPPLED RIVER.\"]\n\nHugh John had no appetite for the \"poison squares\" now. He tried one,\nand it seemed to be composed in equal parts of sawdust and the\nmedicament called \"Rough-on-rats!\" He tried the water in the shell,\nand that was somewhat better; but just to think of tea from the\nurn--soft ivory cream floating on the top, curded a little but light\nas blown sea-foam! Ah, he could wait no longer. The life of a prisoner\nwas all very well, but he could not even get materials with which to\nwrite up his diary till he got home. For this purpose it was necessary\nthat he should immediately make his escape. Also it was kidney\nmorning, and if he did not hurry that little wretch Toady Lion would\nhave eaten up every snatch. He resolved to lose no time.\n\nSo with eager steps he descended the steep wet stairs into the little\nstone chamber, which smelt fearfully damp and clammy, just as if all\nthe snails in the world had been crawling there.\n\n\"I bet the poor chap down here had toothache,\" said Hugh John,\nshivering as he went forward to attack the pile of fallen stones in\nfront of the arched doorway. For an hour he worked most manfully,\npulling out such as he could manage to loosen, and tossing others\naside. Thus he gradually undercut the mass which blocked up the door,\ntill, with a warning creak or two the whole pitched forward and\ninward, giving the daring pioneer just time to leap aside before it\ncame toppling into the narrow cell, which it more than half filled. As\nsoon as the avalanche had settled, Hugh John staggered over the top of\nthe fallen stones and broken _débris_ to the small door. As his head\ncame on a level with the opening he saw a strange sight. He looked\ninto a little ruined turret, the floor of which was of smoothest green\nsward--or, rather, which would have been of green sward had it not\nbeen thickly covered with sheep, all lying placidly shoulder to\nshoulder, and composedly drawing in the morning air through their\nnostrils as if no such word as \"mutton\" existed in the vocabularies of\nany language.\n\nBeyond and over the closely packed woolly backs he saw a stretch of\nrippled river, faceted with diamond and ruby points, where the rising\nsun just touched the tips of the little chill wavelets which were\nfretted by the wind of morning, that gust of cooler air which the dawn\npushes before it round the world. Hugh John was free!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE RETURN FROM THE BASTILE.\n\n\nHe stepped down easily and lightly among the sheep. They rose without\nsurprise or disorder, still with strict attention to business\ncontinuing to munch at the grass they had plucked as they lay, for all\nthe world as if a famous adventure-seeking general had been only the\nharmless but boresome shepherd who came to drive them out to pastures\nnew. For all the surprise they showed they might have been accustomed\nfrom their fleeciest infancy to small, dirty, scratched, bruised,\ninfinitely tattered imps of imperial descent arriving suddenly out of\nunexplored secret passages in ancient fortresses.\n\nThe great commander's first instinct was to rush for home and so make\nsure that Cook Mary the Second had done enough kidneys for breakfast.\nHis second idea, and one more worthy of his military reputation, was\ncarefully to conceal the entrance to the doorway, by which he had\nemerged from the passage he had so wonderfully discovered. No one knew\nhow soon the knowledge might prove useful to him. As a matter of\nattack and defence the underground passage was certainly not to be\nneglected.\n\nThen Hugh John drove the sheep before him out of the fallen tower. As\nhe did so one of them coughed, stretching its neck and holding its\nhead near the ground. He now knew the origin of the sound which\nhad--no, not frightened him (of course not!), but slightly surprised\nhim the evening before.\n\nAnd, lo! there, immediately in front of him as he emerged, was the\nEdam Water, sliding and rippling on under its willows, the slim,\nsilvery-grey leaves showing their white under-sides just as usual.\nThere, across the river, were the cattle, standing already knee-deep\nin the shallows, their tails nervy and switchy on the alert for the\nmorning's crop of flies. There was Mike going to drive them in to be\nmilked. Yonder in the far distance was a black speck which must be\nPeter polishing straps and buckles hung on a pin by the stable door.\n\n\"Horrid beasts every one of them!\" said Hugh John indignantly to\nhimself, \"going on all as comfortable as you please, just as if I had\nnot been pining in a dungeon cell for years and years.\"\n\nThen setting his cramped wet legs in motion, General Napoleon\ncommenced a masterly retreat in the direction of home. He dashed for\nthe stepping-stones, but he was in too much of a hurry to make sure of\nhitting them. He slipped from the first and went above the knee into\nthe clear cool Edam Water. After that he simply floundered through,\nand presently emerged dripping on the other side. Along the woodland\npaths he scurried and scampered. He dashed across glades, scattering\nthe rabbits and kicking up the dew in the joy of recovered freedom. He\nclimbed a stone dyke into the home park, because he had no time to go\nround by the stile. He brought half of the fence down in his haste,\nscraping his knee as he did so. But so excited was he that he scarcely\nfelt the additional bruise.\n\nHe ran up the steps. The front door was standing wide open, with the\ndisreputable and tell-tale air of a reveller who has been out all\nnight in evening dress. All doors have this look which have not been\ndecently shut and locked during the dark hours. There was no one in\nthe hall--no one in the dining-room--no one in the schoolroom, where\nthe children's tea of the night before had never been cleared away.\nHugh John noticed that his own place had been set, and the clean cup\nand plate and the burnished unused knife struck him as infinitely\npathetic.\n\nBut he was hungry, and had no time to waste on mere feelings. His\ninner man was too insistent. He knew well where the pantry was (trust\nhim for that!), and he went towards it at the rate of twenty miles an\nhour. He wished he had remembered to add a petition to his prayer that\nit might be unlocked. But it was now too late for this, so he must\njust trust in an unjogged Providence and take his chances.\n\nThe gods were favourable. They had evidently agreed that for one small\nboy he had suffered enough for that day. The pantry was unlocked.\nThere was a lovely beefsteak pie standing on a shelf. Hugh John lifted\nit off, set it on the candle box, ungratefully throwing Sambo Soulis\non the floor in order to make elbow room, and then with a knife and\nfork he proceeded to demolish the pie. The knife and fork he first put\nhis hands on had obviously been used. But did General Napoleon stop to\ngo to the schoolroom for clean ones? No--several thousand times no!\nThose who can, for a single moment, entertain such thoughts, are very\nfar from having yet made the acquaintance of General Smith. Why, he\ndid not even wait to say grace--though he usually repeated\nhalf-a-dozen the first thing in the morning, so as to have the job\nwell over for the day. It is all right to say grace, but it is such a\nfag to have to remember before every meal. So Hugh John went into the\nwholesale business.\n\nHe was half through the pie before he looked about for something to\ndrink. Lemonade, if it could be found, would meet the case. Hugh John\nfelt this keenly, and, lo! the friendly Fates, with a smile, had\nplanted a whole case of it at his feet. He knocked in the patent\nstopper with the handle of his knife (all things must yield to\nmilitary necessity), and, after the first draught, what more was\nthere left to live for--except a second bottle and the rest of the\npie?\n\nHe was just doing his best to live up to the nice cool jelly, which\nmelted in a kind of lingering chill of delight down his throat, when\nJanet Sheepshanks appeared in the doorway. Wearily and disheartenedly,\nshe had come in to prepare for a breakfast which no one in all Windy\nStandard would eat. Something curious about the feeling of the house\nhad struck her as she entered. She had gone from room to room, divided\nbetween hope and apprehension, and, lo! there before her, in her own\nravished pantry, tuck-full of beefsteak pie and lemonade, sat the boy\nfor whom they were even then dragging the deepest pools of the Edam.\n\n\"Oh, thank the Lord, laddie!\" cried Janet, clasping her hands in\ndevout thankfulness, \"that He hath spared ye to your widowed\nfaither--and to me, your auld unworthy nurse!\"\n\nThe tears were running down her cheeks. Somehow her face had quite\nsuddenly grown grey and worn. She looked years older than she had done\nyesterday. Hugh John paused and looked at her marvelling. He had a\nheavily laden fork half-way to his mouth. He wondered what all the\nfuss was about.\n\n\"Do get me some mustard, Janet,\" he said, swinging his wet legs; \"and\nwhere on earth have you put the pickles?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the cross-examination which naturally followed, Hugh John kept his\nown counsel, like the prudent warrior he was. He left Janet and the\nothers to suppose that, in trying to escape from his foes, he had\n\"fallen\" into the castle dungeon, and none of the household servants\nknew enough of the topography of the ancient stronghold to know that,\nif he had done so, he would probably have broken his neck. He said\nnothing about Nipper Donnan or any of the band by name. Simply and\ntruthfully he designated them as \"some bad boys,\" which certainly was\nin no way overstating the case.\n\nPerhaps if his father had been at home he could not have hoodwinked\nhis questioners so easily and completely. Mr. Picton Smith would\ncertainly have gone deeper into the business than Janet Sheepshanks,\nwho alternately slapped and scolded, petted and spoilt our hero all\nday long.\n\nFor some time Hugh John smelt of Araby the Blest and Spicy Ind; for he\nhad ointments and liniments, rags and plasters innumerable scattered\nover his person in all directions.\n\nHe borrowed a cigarette (it was a very old and dry one) from the\nmantelpiece of his father's workroom, and retired to the shelter of\nthe elm-tree to hold his court and take private evidence upon the\nevents of yesterday.\n\nAs he went across the yard Black Donald ran bleating to him, and\nplayfully butted at his leg.\n\nHugh John stopped in astonishment.\n\n\"Who found him?\" he asked.\n\nSir Toady Lion proudly stepped forward. He had a garden rake in his\nhand, with which the moment before he had been poking Donald in the\nribs, and making his life a burden to him generally.\n\n[\"I CREATE YOU GENERAL OF THE COMM'SARIAT.\"]\n\nHe began to speak, but Hugh John stopped him.\n\n\"Salute, you little beast!\" he said sternly.\n\nSlowly Toady Lion's hand went up. He did not object to salute, but he\nhad a vague sense that, as a matter of personal dignity, not even a\ngeneral had a right to speak to a private thus--much less to a\ncommissariat sergeant. However, what he had to say was so triumphant\nand overpowering that he waived the point and touched his forehead in\ndue form.\n\n\"_I_ did--nobody but me. I d'livered him, all by mineself. I cutted\nthe rope and d'livered Donald. Yes, I did--Prissy will tell 'oo. I\nwented into the Black Sheds all alone-y--and d'livered him!\"\n\nHis words came tumbling over each other in his haste. But he laid\nstrong emphasis upon the word \"delivered,\" which he had just learned\nfrom Prissy. He meant to use it very often all that day, because it\nwas a good word, and nobody knew the meaning of it except\nQuite-Grown-Ups.\n\nGeneral Napoleon Smith put on his most field-marshalish expression,\nand summoned Sir Toady Lion to approach.\n\nHe tapped him on the shoulder and said in a grand voice, \"I create you\nGeneral of the Comm'sariat for distinguished conduct in the field.\nFrom this time forth you can keep the key of the biscuit box, but I\nknow just how many are in. So mind out!\"\n\nThis was good, and Toady Lion was duly grateful; but he wished his\ngood fortune put into a more concrete form.\n\n\"Can I have the biggest and nicerest saucer of the scrapings of the\npreserving-pan to-night?\"\n\nHugh John considered a moment. An impulse of generosity swept over\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, you can,\" he said nobly. Then a cross wave of caution caused him\nto add--\"that is, if it isn't rasps!\"\n\nNow the children of the house of Windy Standard were permitted to\nclean out the boiling-pan in the fruit-preserving season with worn\nhorn spoons, in order not to scratch the copper or crack the enamel.\nAnd rasp was Hugh John's favourite.\n\n\"Huh,\" said Toady Lion, turning up a contemptuous nose. \"Thank 'oo for\nnuffin! I like wasps just as much as 'oo, Hugh John Picton Smiff!\"\n\n\"Don't answer me back, sir!\"--Hugh John was using his father's words\nand manner.\n\n\"Sall if I like,\" said Toady Lion, beginning to whimper. \"Sall go and\ntell Janet Sheepshanks, and she'll give me yots of wasps! Not\nscrapin's neither, but weal-weal wasps--so there!\"\n\n\"Toady Lion, I shall degrade you to the ranks. You are a little pig\nand a disgrace to the army.\"\n\n\"Don't care, I wants wasps--and I d'livered Donald,\" reiterated the\nDisgrace of the Army.\n\nHugh John once more felt the difficulty of arguing with Toady Lion. He\nwas altogether too young to be logical. So he said, \"Toady Lion, you\nlittle ass, stop snivelling--and I'll give you a bone button and the\nhalf of a knife.\"\n\n\"Let's see them,\" said Toady Lion, cautiously uncovering one eye by\nlifting up the edge of the covering palm. His commanding officer\nproduced the articles of peace, and Toady Lion examined them\ncarefully, still with one eye. They proved satisfactory.\n\n\"All yight!\" said he, \"I won't cry no more--but I wants three saucers\nfull of the wasps too!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. MUTINY IN THE CAMP.\n\n\nHugh John was holding his court under the weeping-elm, and was being\nvisited in detail by his army. The Carters had come over, and, after a\nvigorous engagement and pursuit, he had even forgiven Sammy for his\nlack of hardihood in not resisting to the death at the great battle of\nthe Black Sheds.\n\n\"But it hurts so confoundedly,\" argued Sammy; \"if it didn't, I\nshouldn't mind getting killed a bit!\"\n\n\"Look at me,\" said Hugh John; \"I'm all over peels and I don't\ncomplain.\"\n\n\"Oh! I dare say--it's all very well for you,\" retorted Sammy, \"you\nlike to fight, and it was you that began the fuss, but I only fight\nbecause you'd jolly-well-hammer me if I didn't!\"\n\n\"Course I would,\" agreed his officer, \"don't you know that's what\ngenerals are for?\"\n\n\"Well,\" concluded Sammy Carter, summing the matter up philosophically,\n\"'tain't my castle anyway.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe review was over. In the safe quiet of the elm-tree shelter General\nNapoleon might have been seen taking his well-earned repose. He was\nsurrounded by his entire following--except, of course, the two\nGenerals of Division, who were engaged in sweeping out the\nstable-yard. But these were considered socially supernumerary at any\nrate, except (a somewhat important exception) when there was fighting\nto be done.\n\n\"I don't see that we've done so very much to make a brag about\nanyhow,\" began Sammy Carter.\n\nGeneral Smith dexterously caught him on the ear with a young turnip,\nwhich in company with several friends had wandered in of its own\naccord from the nearest field on the home farm.\n\n\"I should say _you_ didn't do much!\" he sneered pointedly; \"you hooked\nit as hard as you could after the first skirmish. Why, you haven't got\na single sore place about you to show for it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" retorted Sammy in high indignation.\n\n[\"SAMMY CARTER MUTINOUS.\"]\n\n\"Well, let's see it then!\" commanded his general in a kindlier tone.\n\n\"Can't--ladies present!\" said Sammy succinctly, into the retreating\nrear-guard of whose division the triumphant enemy had charged with the\npike snatched from his sister's hands.\n\n\"All _my_ wounds are in front. _I_ fought and died with my face to the\nfoe!\" said Hugh John in his noblest manner.\n\n\"And I d'livered Donald!\" contributed Toady Lion complacently.\n\n\"Oh, _that_ ain't anything,\" sneered Sammy Carter, who was not in a\ngood humour. His tone roused General Napoleon, who had the strong\nfamily feelings of all the Buonapartes.\n\n\"Shut up, Sammy, or I'll come and kick you. None of us did anything\nexcept Toady Lion. You ran away, and I got taken prisoner. Toady Lion\nis the only man among us!\"\n\n\"I runned away too--at first,\" confessed the candid Toady Lion, who\nfelt that he had so much real credit that he did not need to take a\ngrain more than he deserved. \"But I comed back quick--and I d'livered\nDonald out of prison, anyway--I did!\"\n\nSammy Carter evidently had a sharp retort ready on the tip of his\ntongue, but he knew well the price he would have to pay for uttering\nit. Hugh John's eye was upon him, his right hand was closing on a\nbigger turnip--so Sammy forbore. But he kicked his feet more\ndiscontentedly than ever into the turf.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, changing the venue of the argument, \"I don't think\nmuch of your old castle anyway. My father could have twice as good a\ncastle if he liked----\"\n\n\"Oh, 'course he could\"--Hugh John's voice was distinctly ironical--\"he\nmight plant it on a peaty soil, and grow it from seed in two years; or\nperhaps he would like a cutting off ours!\"\n\nMr. Davenant Carter was a distinguished agriculturist and florist.\n\n\"Don't you speak against my father!\" cried Sammy Carter, glowering at\nGeneral Napoleon in a way in which privates do not often look at their\nCommanders-in-Chief.\n\n\"Who's touching your father?\" the latter said, a little more\nsoothingly. \"See here, Sammy, you've got your coat on wrong side out\nto-day. Go home and sleep on it. 'Tisn't my fault if you did run away,\nand got home before your sister--with a blue place on your back.\"\n\nSammy Carter flung out from under the shelter of the elm and went in\nsearch of Prissy, from whom in all his moods he was sure of comfort\nand understanding. He was a somewhat delicate boy, and generally\nspeaking hated quarrelling as much as she did; but he had a clever\ntongue, which often brought him into trouble, and, like most other\nhumorists, he did not at all relish a jest at his own expense.\n\nAs he went, he was pursued and stung by the brutally unrefined taunts\nof Hugh John.\n\n\"Yes, go on to Prissy; I think she has a spare doll. Go and play at\n'house'! It's all you're good for!\"\n\nThus encouraged by their general, the rest of the company--that is,\nCissy and Sir Toady Lion, joined in singing a certain stirring and\nirritating refrain popular among the youth of Bordershire.\n\n    \"_Lassie-boy, lassie-boy, fie for shame!\n    Coward's your nature, and Jennie's your name!_\"\n\nSammy Carter stood poised for flight with his eyes blazing with anger.\n\n\"You think a lot of your old tumble-down castle; but the town boys\nhave got it in spite of you; and what's more, they've a flag flying on\nit with 'Down with Smith!' on it. I saw it. Hooray for the town boys!\"\n\nAnd with this Parthian arrow he disappeared at full speed down the\navenue.\n\nFor a moment Hugh John was paralysed. He tried to pooh-pooh the\nmatter, but he could not but admit that it might very well be true; so\nhe instantly despatched Toady Lion for Prissy, who, as we know, was\nthe fleetest runner of them all. Upon her reporting for duty, the\nGeneral sent her to bring back word if the state of affairs was as\nreported.\n\nIt was. A large red flag was flying, with the inscription in white\nupon it, \"Down with Smith!\" while above the inscription there was what\nlooked like a rude attempt at a death's head and crossbones. Hugh John\nknew this ensign in a moment. Once upon a time, in his wild youth, he\nhad served under it as a pirate on the high seas; but of this he now\nuttered no word.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was in such moments that the true qualities of the born leader came\nout in General Napoleon Smith. Instantly he dismissed his attendants,\nput his finger to his forehead, and sat down to draw a map of the\ncampaign in the genuine Napoleonic manner.\n\nAt last, after quite a while, he rapped upon the table.\n\n\"I have it,\" he cried, \"we must find an ally.\" The problem was\nsolved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. CISSY CARTER, BOYS' GIRL.\n\n\nNow Prissy Smith was a girls' girl, while Cissy Carter was a boys'\ngirl. That was mainly the difference between them. Not that Prissy did\nnot love boys' play upon occasion, for which indeed her fleetness of\nfoot particularly fitted her. Also if Hugh John teased her she never\ncried nor told on him, but waited till he was looking the other way\nand then gave him something for himself on the ear. But on the whole\nshe was a girls' girl, and her idea of the way to fight was slapping\nher dolls when they were naughty.\n\nNow, Mr. Picton Smith said that most religion was summed up in two\nmaxims, \"Don't tell lies,\" and \"Don't tell tales.\" To these Hugh John\nadded a third, at least equal in canonicity, \"Don't be dasht-mean.\" In\nthese you have briefly comprehended all the Law and the Prophets of\nthe house of Windy Standard.\n\nCissy Carter, however, was a tom-boy: you could not get over that.\nThere was no other word for her. She never played with girls if she\ncould better herself. She despised dolls; she hated botany and the\npiano. Her governess had a hard but lively time of it, and had it not\nbeen for her brother Sammy coaching her in short cuts to knowledge,\nshe would have been left far behind in the exact sciences of spelling\nand the multiplication-table. As it was, between a tendency to\nscramble for scraps of information and the run of a pretty wide\nlibrary, Cissy knew more than any one gave her credit for.\n\nOn one memorable occasion it was Cissy's duty to take her grandmother\nfor a walk. Now the Dowager Mrs. Davenant Carter was the dearest and\nmost fairy-like old lady in the world, and Cissy was very proud to\nwalk into Edam with her. For her grandmother had not forgotten how\ngood confections tasted to girls of thirteen, and there was quite a\nnice shop in the High Street. Their rose-drops especially were almost\nas good as doing-what-you-were-told-not-to, and their peppermints for\nuse in church had quite the force of a religious observance.\n\nBut Mrs. Davenant Carter had a weak eye, and whenever she went out,\nshe put a large green shade over it. So one day it happened that Cissy\nwas walking abroad with her grandmother, with a vision of\nrose-drop-shop in the offing. As they were passing one of the villas\nnearest to their house, a certain rude boy, Wedgwood Baker the name of\nhim, seeing the lame old lady tripping by on her stick like a fairy\ngodmother, called out loudly \"Go it, old blind patch!\"\n\nHe was sorry the minute after, for in one moment Cissy Carter had\npulled off her white thread gloves, climbed the fence, and had landed\nwhat Hugh John would have called \"One, two, three--and a tiger\" upon\nthe person of Master Wedgwood Baker.\n\nI do not say that all Cissy Carter's blows were strictly according to\nQueensberry rules. But at any rate the ungallant youth was promptly\ndoubled up, and retreated yelling into the house, as it were falling\nback upon his reserves.\n\nThat same evening the card of Mrs. Baker, Laurel Villa, Edam, was\nbrought to the diningtable of Mrs. Davenant Carter.\n\n\"The lady declines to come in, m'am. She says she must see you\nimmediately at the door,\" said the scandalised housemaid.\n\nCissy's mother went into the hall with the card in her hand, and a\nlook of gentle surprised inquiry on her face. There, on the doorstep\nwas Mrs. Baker, with a young and hopeful but sadly damaged Wedgwood\ntagging behind her, like a weak-minded punt in tow of an ancient\nthreedecker.\n\n[\"'LOOK AT HIM, MADAM,' SAID MRS. BAKER.\"]\n\nThe injured lady began at once a voluble complaint.\n\n\"Look at him, madam. That is the handiwork of your daughter. The poor\nboy was quietly digging in the garden, cultivating a few unpretending\nflowers, when your daughter, madam, suddenly flew at him over the\nrailings and struck him on the face so furiously that, if I had not\ncome to the rescue, the dear boy might have lost the use of both his\neyes. But most happily I heard the disturbance and went out and\nstopped her.\"\n\n\"Dear me, this is _very_ sad,\" faltered little Mrs. Carter; \"I'm sure\nI don't know what can have come over Cissy. Are you sure there is no\nmistake?\"\n\n\"Mistake! No, indeed, madam, there is no mistake, I saw her with my\nown eyes--a great girl twice Wedgwood's size.\"\n\nAt this point Mr. Davenant Carter came to the door with his\ntable-napkin in his hand.\n\n\"What's this--what's this?\" he demanded in his quick way--\"Cissy and\nyour son been fighting?\"\n\n\"No indeed, sir,\" said the complainant indignantly; \"this dear boy\nnever so much as lifted a hand to her. Ah, here she comes--the\nvery--ahem, young lady herself.\"\n\nAll ignorant of the trouble in store for her, Cissy came whistling\nthrough the laurels with half-a-dozen dogs at her heels. At sight of\nher Mrs. Baker bridled and perked her chin with indignation till all\nher black bugles clashed and twinkled.\n\n\"Come here, Cissy,\" said her father sternly. \"Did you strike this boy\nto-day in front of his mother's gate?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" quoth the undaunted Cissy, \"and what's more, I'll do it\nagain, and give him twice as much, if he ever dares to call _my_\ngrandmother 'Old Blind Patch' again--I don't care if he is two years\nand three months older than me!\"\n\n\"Did you call names at my mother?\" demanded Cissy's father, towering\nup very big, and looking remarkably stern.\n\nMaster Wedgwood had no denial ready; but he had his best boots on and\nhe looked very hard at them.\n\n\"Come, Wedgwood dear, tell them that you did not call names. You know\nyou could not!\"\n\n\"I never called nobody names. It was her that hit me!\" snivelled\nWedgwood.\n\n\"Now, you hear,\" said his mother, as if that settled the question.\n\n\"Oh, you little liar! Wait till I catch you out!\" said Cissy, going a\nstep nearer as if she would like to begin again. \"I'll teach you to\ntell lies on me.\"\n\nMrs. Baker of Laurel Villa held up her hands so that the lace mitts\ncame together like the fingers of a figure of grief upon a tomb. \"What\na dreadful girl!\" she said, looking up as if to ask Heaven to support\nher.\n\nMr. Davenant Carter remembered his position as a county magistrate.\nAlso he desired to stand well with all his neighbours.\n\n\"Madam,\" he said to Mrs. Baker, in the impressive tone in which he\naddressed public meetings, \"I regret exceedingly that you should have\nbeen put to this trouble. I think that for the future you will have no\nreason to complain of my daughter. Will you allow me to conduct you\nacross the policies by the shorter way? Cissy, go to bed _at once_,\nand stop there till I bid you get up! That will teach you to take the\nlaw into you own hands when your father is a Justice of the Peace!\"\n\nThis he said in such a stern voice that Mrs. Baker was much flattered\nand quite appeased. He walked with the lady to the small gate in the\nboundary wall, opened it with his private key, and last of all shook\nhands with his visitor with the most distinguished courtesy. Some day\nhe meant to stand for the burgh and her brothers were well-to-do\ngrocers in the town.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said in parting, \"I hope you will not be too severe with\nthe young lady. Perhaps after all she was only a trifle impulsive!\"\n\n\"Discipline must be maintained,\" said Mr. Davenant Carter sternly,\nclosing, however, at the same time the eyelid most remote from Mrs.\nBaker of Laurel Villa.\n\n\"It shows what a humbug pa is,\" muttered Cissy, as she went upstairs;\n\"he knows very well it is bed-time anyway. I don't believe he is angry\none bit!\"\n\nWhen her father came in, he looked over at his wife. I am afraid he\ndeliberately winked, though in the interests of morality I trust I\nmay be mistaken. For how could a Justice of the Peace and a future\nMember of Parliament demean himself to wink?\n\n\"Jane,\" he said to Mrs. Carter, \"what does Cissy like most of all for\nsupper?\"\n\n\"A little bit of chicken and bread-sauce done with broiled bacon--at\nleast I think so, dear--why do you ask?\"\n\nHe called the tablemaid.\n\n\"Walbridge,\" he said sternly, \"take that disgraceful girl up the\nbreast and both wings of a chicken, also three nice pieces of crisp\nbacon, four new potatoes with butter-sauce, some raspberrytart with\nthick cream and plenty of sugar--and a whole bottle of zoedone. But\nmind you, _nothing else_, as you value your place--not another bite\nfor such a bold bad girl. This will teach her to go about the country\nthrashing boys two years older than herself!\"\n\nHe looked over across the table at his son.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, sir,\" he said, frowning sternly at him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Sammy meekly, winking in his turn very confidentially\nat a fly which was having a free wash and brush-up on the edge of the\nfingerbowl, after completing the round of the dishes on the dinner\ntable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME--AND ENDS THERE.\n\n\nNow all this has nothing to do with the story, except to show what\nsort of a girl Cissy Carter was, and how she differed from Prissy\nSmith--who in these circumstances would certainly have gone home and\nprayed that God would in time make Wedgwood Baker a better boy,\ninstead of tackling missionary work on the spot with her knuckles as\nCissy Carter did.\n\nIt was several days later, and the flag of the Smoutchy boys still\nflew defiantly over the battlements of the castle. The great General\nwas growing discouraged, for in little more than a week his father\nmight return from London, and would doubtless take up the matter\nhimself. Then, with the coming of policemen and the putting up of\nfences and notice-boards, all romance would be gone forever. Besides\nwhich, most of the town boys would have to go back to school, and the\nCarters' governess and their own would be returning to annoy them with\nlessons, and still more uncalled for aggravations as to manners.\n\nCissy Carter had given Sammy the slip, and started to come over by\nherself to Windy Standard. It was the afternoon, and she came past the\ngipsy encampment which Mr. Picton Smith had found on some unenclosed\nland on the other side of the Edam Water, and which, spite of the\nremonstrances of his brother-landlords, he had permitted to remain\nthere.\n\nThe permanent Ishmaelitish establishment consisted of about a dozen\nsmall huts, some entirely constructed of rough stone, others of turf\nwith only a stone interposed here and there; but all had mud chimneys,\nrough doorways, and windows glazed with the most extraordinary\ncollection of old glass, rags, wisps of straw, and oiled cloth. Dogs\nbarked hoarsely and shrilly according to their kind, ragged clothes\nfluttered on extemporised lines, or made a parti-coloured patch-work\non the grass and on the gorse bushes which grew all along the bank.\nThere were also a score of tents and caravans dotted here and there\nabout the rough ground. Half-a-dozen swarthy lads rose silently and\nstared after Cissy as she passed.\n\nA tall limber youth sitting on a heap of stones examining a dog's\nback, looked up and scowled as she came by. Cissy saw an unhealed\nwound and stopped.\n\n\"Let me look at him,\" she said, reaching out her hand for the white\nfox-terrier.\n\n\"Watch out, miss,\" said the lad, \"he's nasty with the sore. He'll bite\nquick as mustard!\"\n\n\"He won't bite me,\" said Cissy, taking up the dog calmly, which after\na doubtful sniff submitted to be handled without a murmur.\n\n\"This should be thoroughly washed, and have some boracic ointment put\non it at once,\" said Cissy, with the quick emphasis of an expert.\n\n\"Ain't got none o' the stuff,\" said the youth sullenly, \"nor can't\nafford to buy it. Besides, who's to wash him first off, and him in a\ntemper like that?\"\n\n\"Come over with me to Oaklands and I'll get you some ointment. I'll\nwash him myself in a minute.\"\n\nThe boy whistled.\n\n\"That's a good 'un,\" he said, \"likely thing me to go to Oaklands!\"\n\n\"And why?\" said Cissy; \"it's my father's place. I've just come from\nthere.\"\n\n\"Then your father's a beak, and I ain't going a foot--not if I know\nit,\" said the lad.\n\n\"A what--oh! you mean a magistrate--so he is. Well, then, if you feel\nlike that about it I'll run over by myself, and sneak some ointment\nfrom the stables.\"\n\nAnd with a careless wave of the hand, a pat on the head and a \"Poo'\nfellow then\" to the white fox-terrier, she was off.\n\nThe youth cast his voice over his shoulders to a dozen companions who\nwere hiding in the broom behind. His face and tone were both full of\nsurprise and admiration.\n\n[\"'LET ME LOOK AT HIM,' SHE SAID.\"]\n\n\"Say, chaps, did you hear her? She said she'd 'sneak' the ointment\nfrom the stables. I tell 'ee what, she'll be a rare good plucked one\nthat. And her a beak's daughter! Her mother mun ha' been a piece!\"\n\nIt was half-an-hour before Cissy got back with the pot of boracic\ndressing and some lint.\n\n\"I had to wait till the coachman had gone to his tea,\" she explained,\n\"and then send the stable boy with a message to the village to get him\nout of the way.\"\n\nThe youth on the stone heap secretly signalled his delight to the\nappreciative audience hiding in the broom bushes.\n\nThen Cissy ordered him to get her some warm water, which he brought\nfrom one of the kettles swinging on the birchen tripods scattered here\nand there about the encampment.\n\nWhereupon, taking the fox-terrier firmly on her knee and turning up\nthe skirt of her dress, she washed away all the dirt and matted hair,\ncleansing the wound thoroughly.\n\nThe poor beast only made a faint whining sound at intervals. Then she\napplied the antiseptic dressing, and bound the lint tightly down with\na cincture about the animal. She fitted his neck with a neat collar of\nher own invention, made out of the wicker covering of a Chianti wine\nflask which she brought with her from Oaklands.\n\n\"There,\" she said, \"that will keep him from biting at it, and you must\nsee that he doesn't scratch off the bandage. I'll be passing\nto-morrow and will drop in. Here's the pot of ointment. Put some more\non in the morning and some again at night, and he will be all right in\na day or two.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee, miss,\" said the lad, touching his cap with the natural\ncourtesy which is inherent in the best blood of his race. \"I don't\nmean to forget, you be sure.\"\n\nCissy waved her hand to him gaily, as she went off towards Windy\nStandard. Then all at once she stopped.\n\n\"By the way, what is your name? Whom shall I ask for if you are not\nabout to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Billy Blythe,\" he said, after a moment's pause to consider whether\nthe daughter of a magistrate was to be trusted; \"but I'll be here\nto-morrow right enough!\"\n\n\"Why did you tell the beak's daughter your name, Bill, you blooming\nJohnny?\" asked a companion. \"You'll get thirty days for that sure!\"\n\n\"Shut up, Fish Lee,\" said the owner of the dog; \"the girl is main\nright. D'ye think she'd ha' said 'sneaked' if she wasn't. G'way,\nBacon-chump!\"\n\nCissy Carter took the road to Windy Standard with a good conscience.\nShe was not troubled about the \"sneaking,\" though she hoped that the\ncoachman would not miss that pot of ointment.\n\nAt the foot of the avenue, just where it joined the dusty road to the\ntown of Edam, she met Sir Toady Lion. He had his arms full of valuable\nsparkling jewellery, or what in the distance looked like it as the sun\nshone upon some winking yellow metal.\n\nToady Lion began talking twenty to the dozen as soon as ever he came\nwithin Cissy's range.\n\n\"Oo!\" he cried, \"what 'oo fink? Father sented us each a great big\nhalf-crown from London--all to spend. And we have spended it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Cissy genially, \"and what did you buy?\"\n\n\"Us all wented down to Edam and boughted--oh! yots of fings.\"\n\n\"Show me what you've bought, Toady Lion! I want to see! How much money\nhad you, did you say?\"\n\nToady Lion sat plump down in the thickest dust of the road, as he\nalways did just wherever he happened to be at the time. If there\nchanced to be a pool there or a flower-bed--why, so much the worse.\nBut whenever Toady Lion wanted to sit down, he sat down. Here,\nhowever, there was only the dry dust of the road and a brown smatter\nof last year's leaves. The gallant knight was in a meditative mood and\ninclined to moralise.\n\n\"Money,\" said Toady Lion thoughtfully, \"well, dere's the money that\nyou get gived you, and wot Janet sez you muss put in your money-box.\nThat's no good! Money-box locked! Janet keeps money-box. 'Get money\nwhen you are big,' she sez--rubbage, I fink--shan't want it then--lots\nand lots in trowsies' pocket then, gold sixpences and fings.\"\n\nToady Lion's eyes were dreamy and glorious, as if the angels were\nwhispering to him, and he saw unspeakable things,\n\n\"Then there's miss'nary money in a round box wif a slit on the top.\nThat's lots better! Sits on mantlepiece in dining-room. Can get it out\nwif slimmy-jimmy knife when nobody's looking. Hugh John showed me how.\nPrissy says boys who grab miss'nary's pennies won't not go to heaven,\nbut Hugh John, he says--yes. 'Cause why miss'nary's money is for bad\nwicked people to make them good. Then if it is wicked to take\nmiss'nary money, the money muss be meaned for us--to do good to me and\nHugh John. Hugh John finks so. Me too!\"\n\nToady Lion spoke in short sentences with pauses between, Cissy\nmeantime nodding appreciation.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" she said meditatively, \"a thinbladed kitchen knife is\nbest.\"\n\nBut Sir Toady Lion had started out on the track of Right and Wrong,\nand was intent on running them down with his usual slow persistence.\n\n\"And then the miss'nary money is weally-weally our money, 'cause Janet\n_makes_ us put it in. Onst Hugh John tried metal buttons off of his\nold serge trowsies. But Janet she found out. And he got smacked. An'\nnen, us only takes a penny out when us is _tony-bloke_!\"\n\n\"Is which? Oh, stone-broke,\" laughed Cissy Carter, sitting down beside\nToady Lion; \"who taught you to say that word?\"\n\n\"Hugh John,\" said the small boy wistfully; \"him and me tony-bloke\nall-ee-time, all-ee-ways, all-ee-while!\"\n\n\"Does Prissy have any of--the missionary money?\" said Cissy; \"I\nshould!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Toady Lion sadly; \"don't you know? Our Prissy's awful good,\njuss howwid! She likes goin' to church, an' washing, an' having to\nwear gloves. Girls is awful funny.\"\n\n\"They are,\" said Cissy Carter promptly. The funniness of her sex had\noften troubled her. \"But tell me, Toady Lion,\" she went on, \"does Hugh\nJohn like going to church, and being washed, and things?\"\n\n\"Who? Hugh John--him?\" said Toady Lion, with slow contempt. \"'Course\nhe don't. Why, he's a boy. And once he told Mr. Burnham so--he did.\"\n\nMr. Burnham was the clergyman of both families. He had recently come\nto the place, was a well-set up bachelor, and represented a communion\nwhich was not by any means the dominant one in Bordershire.\n\n\"Yes, indeedy. It was under the elm. Us was having tea. An' Mist'r\nBurnham, he was having tea. And father and Prissy. And, oh! such a lot\nof peoples. And he sez, Mist'r Burnham sez to Hugh John, 'You are good\nlittle boy. I saw you in church on Sunday. Do you like to go to\nchurch?' He spoke like this-a-way, juss like I'm tellin' oo, down here\nunder his silk waistcoat--kind of growly, but nice.\"\n\n\"Hugh John say that he liked to go to church--'cos father was there\nlistenin', you see. Then Mist'r Burnham ask Hugh John WHY he like to\ngo to church, and of course, he say wight out that it was to look at\nSergeant Steel's wed coat. An' nen everybody laugh--I don't know why.\nBut Mist'r Burnham he laughed most.\"\n\nCissy also failed to understand why everybody should have laughed.\nToady Lion took up the burden of his tale.\n\n\"Yes, indeedy, and one Sunday _I_ didn't have to go to church--'cos\nI'd yet up such a yot of gween gooseb----\"\n\n\"All right, Toady Lion, I know!\" interrupted Cissy quickly.\n\n\"Of gween gooseberries,\" persisted Toady Lion calmly; \"so I had got my\ntummy on in front. It hurted like--well, like when you get sand down\n'oo trowsies. Did 'oo ever get sand in 'oo trowsies, Cissy?\"\n\n\"Hush--of course not!\" said Cissy Carter; \"girls don't have\ntrowsers--they have----\"\n\nBut any injudicious revelations on Cissy's part were stopped by Toady\nLion, who said, \"No, should juss fink not. Girls is too great softs to\nhave trowsies.\n\n\"Onst though on the sands at a seaside, when I was '_kye-kying_' out\nloud an' kickin' fings, 'cos I was not naughty but only fractious,\ndere was a lady wat said 'Be dood, little boy, why can't you be dood?'\n\n\"An' nen I says, 'How can I be dood? Could 'oo be dood wif all that\nsand in 'oo trowsies?'\n\n\"An' nen--the lady she wented away quick, so quick--I can't tell why.\nP'raps _she_ had sand in her trowsies! Does 'oo fink so, Cissy?\"\n\n\"That'll do--I quite understand,\" said Cissy Carter, somewhat hastily,\nin dread of Toady Lion's well-known license of speech.\n\n\"An' nen 'nother day after we comed home I went into the park and\nclum up a nice tree. An' it was ever so gween and scratchy. 'An it was\nnice. Nen father he came walking his horse slow up the road, n' I hid.\nBut father he seen me. And he say, 'What you doing there, little boy?\nYou break you neck. Nen I whip you. Come down, you waskal!' He said it\nbig--down here, (Toady Lion illustrated with his hand the place from\nwhich he supposed his father's voice to proceed). An' it made me feel\nall queer an' trimbly, like our guinea pig's nose when father speak\nlike that. An' I says to him, 'Course, father, you never clumb up no\ntrees on Sundays when _you_ was little boy!' An' nen he didn't speak\nno more down here that trimbly way, but laughed, and pulled me down,\nand roded me home in front of him, and gived me big hunk of pie--yes,\nindeedy!\"\n\nToady Lion felt that now he had talked quite enough, and began to\narrange his brass cannons on the dust, in a plan of attack which\nbeleaguered Cissy Carter's foot and turned her flank to the left.\n\n\"Where did you get all those nice new cannons? You haven't told me\nyet,\" she said.\n\n\"Boughted them!\" answered Toady Lion promptly, \"least I boughted some,\nand Hugh John boughted some, an' Prissy she boughted some.\"\n\n\"And how do you come to have them all?\" asked Cissy, watching the\nimposing array. As usual it was the Battle of Bannockburn and the\nEnglish were getting it hot.\n\n\"Well,\" said Toady Lion thoughtfully, \"'twas this way. 'Oo sees\nPrissy had half-a-crown, an' she boughted a silly book all about a\n'Lamplighter' for herself--an' two brass cannons--one for Hugh John\nan' one for me. And Hugh John he had half-a-crown, an' he boughted\nthree brass cannon, two for himself and one for me.\"\n\n\"And what did you buy with your half-crown?\" said Cissy, bending her\nbrows sweetly upon the small gunner.\n\n\"Wif my half-a-crown? Oh, I just boughted three brass cannons--_dey\nwas all for mine-self_!\"\n\n\"Toady Lion,\" cried Cissy indignantly, \"you are a selfish little pig!\nI shan't stop with you any more.\"\n\n\"Little pigs is nice,\" said Toady Lion, unmoved, arranging his cannon\nall over again on a new plan after the removal of Cissy's foot; \"their\nnoses----\"\n\n\"Don't speak to me about their noses, you selfish little boy! Blow\nyour own nose.\"\n\n\"No use,\" said Toady Lion philosophically; \"won't stay blowed. 'Tis\ntoo duicy!\"\n\nCissy set off in disgust towards the house of Windy Standard, leaving\nToady Lion calmly playing with his six cannon all alone in the white\ndust of the king's highway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. LOVE'S (VERY) YOUNG DREAM.\n\n\nCissy found our hero in a sad state of depression. Prissy had gone off\nto evening service, and had promised to introduce a special petition\nthat he might beat the Smoutchy boys; but Gen'l Smith shook his head.\n\n\"With Prissy you can't never tell. Like as not she may go and pray\nthat Nipper Donnan may get converted, or die and go to heaven, or\nsomething like that. She'd do it like winking, without a thought for\nhow I should feel! That's the sort of girl our Priss is!\"\n\n\"Oh, surely not so bad as that,\" said Cissy, very properly\nscandalised.\n\n\"She would, indeed,\" said Hugh John, nodding his head vehemently;\n\"she's good no end, our Prissy is. And never shirks prayers, nor\nforgets altogether, nor even says them in bed. I believe she'd get up\non a frosty night and say them without a fire--she would, I'm telling\nyou. And she doats on these nasty Smoutchies. She'd just love to have\nbeen tortured. She'd have regularly spread herself on forgiving them\ntoo, our Priss would.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have forgived them,\" cried the piping voice of Toady Lion,\nsuddenly appearing through the shrubbery (his own more excellent form\nwas \"scrubbery\"), with his arms full of the new brass cannons; \"I\nwouldn't have forgived them a bit. I'd have cutted off all their\nheads.\"\n\n\"Go 'way, little pig!\" cried Cissy indignantly.\n\n\"Toady Lion isn't a little pig,\" said Hugh John, with dignity; \"he is\nmy brother.\"\n\n\"But he kept all the cannons to himself,\" remonstrated Cissy.\n\n\"'Course he did; why shouldn't he? He's only a little boy, and can't\ngrow good all at once,\" said Hugh John, with more Christian charity\nthan might have been expected of him.\n\n\"You've been growing good yourself,\" said Cissy, thrusting out her\nupper lip with an expression of bitter reproach and disappointment;\n\"I'd better go home.\"\n\n\"I'll hit you if you say that, Cissy,\" cried Hugh John, \"but anyway\nyou shan't call Toady Lion a little pig.\"\n\n\"I like being little pig,\" said Toady Lion impassively; \"little piggie\ngoes '_Grunt-grunt!_'\"\n\nAnd he illustrated the peculiarities of piglings by pulling the air up\nthrough his nostrils in various keys. \"Little pigs is nice,\" he\nrepeated at the end of this performance.\n\nCissy was very angry. Things appeared to be particularly horrid that\nafternoon. She had started out to help everybody, and had only managed\nto quarrel with them. Even her own familiar Hugh John had lifted up\nhis heel against her. It was the last straw. But she was resolved to\nnot give in now.\n\n\"Good little boy\"--she said tauntingly--\"it is such a mother's pet! It\nwill be good then, and go and ask Nipper's pardon, and send back\nDonald to make nice mutton pies; it shall then----!\"\n\nHugh John made a rush at this point. There was a wild scurry of\nflight, and the gravel flew every way. Cissy was captured behind the\nstable, and Hugh John was about to administer punishment. His hand was\ndoubled. It was drawn back.\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Cissy, \"hit a girl! Any boy can beat you. But you can hit\na girl! Hit hard, brave soldier!\"\n\nHugh John's hand dropped as if struck by lightning.\n\n\"I never did!\" he said; \"I fought ten of them at once and never even\ncried when they--when they----\"\n\nAnd the erstwhile dauntless warrior showed unmistakable signs of being\nperilously near a descent into the vale of tears.\n\n\"When they what?\" queried Cissy softly, suddenly beginning to be\nsorry.\n\n\"Well, when they tortured me,\" said Hugh John.\n\n[\"'HIT HARD, BRAVE SOLDIER.'\"]\n\nCissy went up suddenly and kissed him. It was only a peck which\nreached land at the top corner of his ear; but it made Hugh John\ncrimson hotly, and fend Cissy off with his elbow as if she had been a\nbig boy about to strike.\n\n\"There, now,\" she said, \"I've done it. I promised I would, and what's\nmore, I'll say it out loud--'I love you!' There! And if you don't mind\nand behave, I'll tell people. I will, now then. But all the same, I'm\nsorry I was a beast to you.\"\n\n\"Well, don't do it again,\" said Hugh John, somewhat mollified,\nslightly dropping the point of his defensive elbow. \"Anybody might\nhave seen you, and then what would they think?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Cissy soothingly, \"I won't any more.\"\n\n\"Say 'Hope-you-may-die!'\"\n\nCissy promptly hoped she might come to an early grave in the event of\nagain betraying, even in private, the exuberance of her young\naffection.\n\n\"Now, Hugh John,\" said Cissy, when peace had been restored in this\nmanner, and they were wandering amicably across the back meadow where\nthey could not be seen from the house windows, taking alternate sucks\nat a stick of brown toffee with crumbs stuck firmly on it, the\nproperty of Cissy, \"I've something to tell you. I've found the allies\nfor you; and we can whop the Smoutchies and take the castle now--any\ntime.\"\n\nThe eyes of General Napoleon Smith glistened.\n\n\"If that's true,\" he said, \"you can kiss me again--no, not now,\" he\nadded hastily, moving off a little, \"but after, when it's all over,\nyou know. There's a good place behind the barn. You can do it there\nif you like.\"\n\n\"Will _you_ say 'I love you, Cissy'?\"\n\nBut this was more than Hugh John had bargained for. He asked time for\nconsideration.\n\n\"It won't be till the Smoutchy boys are beaten and the castle ours for\ngood,\" pleaded Cissy.\n\nHugh John felt that it was a great price to pay, but after all he did\nwant dreadfully to beat the Smoutchy boys.\n\n\"Well, I'll try,\" he said, \"but you must say, 'Hope-you'll-die and\ndouble-die,' if you ever tell!\"\n\nAgain Cissy took the required oath.\n\n\"Well?\" said he expectantly, his mind altogether on the campaign.\n\nCissy told him all about the gipsy encampment and the history of the\nmeeting with Billy Blythe. Hugh John nodded. Of course he knew all\nabout that, but would they join? Were they not rather on the side of\nthe Smoutchies? They looked as if they would be.\n\n\"Oh, you can't never tell a bit beforehand,\" said Cissy eagerly. \"They\njust hate the town boys; and Bill Blythe says that Nipper Donnan's\nfather said, that when the town got the castle they would soon clear\nthe gipsies off your common--for that goes with the castle.\"\n\nHugh John nodded again more thoughtfully. There was certainly\nsomething in that. He had heard his father say as much to his lawyer\nwhen he himself was curled up on the sofa, pretending to read\nFroissart's \"Chronicles,\" but really listening as hard as ever he\ncould.\n\n\"You are a brick,\" he cried, \"you are indeed, Cissy. Come on, let's go\nat once and see Billy Blythe.\"\n\nAnd he took her hand. She held back a moment. They were safe behind\nthe great ivy bush at the back of the stables.\n\n\"Couldn't you say it now?\" she whispered, with a soft light in her\neyes; \"I wish you could. Try.\"\n\nHugh John's face darkened. He unshipped his elbow from his side to be\nready for action.\n\n\"Well, I won't ask you till after,\" she said regretfully. \"'Tain't\nfair, I know; but--\" she looked at him again yet more wistfully, still\nholding him by the hand which had last passed over the mutual\njoint-stock candy-stick; \"don't you think you could do the other--just\nonce?\"\n\n\"What other?\" grumbled Hugh John, sulking. He felt that Cissy was\ntaking an unfair advantage.\n\n\"Oh, _you_ know,\" said Cissy, \"what I did to you a little while ago.\"\n\n\"'Twasn't to be till after,\" urged our hero, half relenting. Like a\nwoman, Cissy was quick to see her advantage.\n\n\"Just a little one to be going on with?\" she pleaded.\n\nHugh John sighed. Girls were incomprehensible. Prissy liked church and\nbeing washed. Cissy, of whom he had more hopes, liked kissing.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"goodness knows why you like it. I'm sure I don't and\nnever shall. But--\"\n\nHe ran to the corner and looked round into the stable-yard. All was\nquiet along the Potomac. He walked more sternly to the other corner,\nand glanced into the orchard. Peace reigned among the apple-trees. He\ncame slowly and dejectedly back. In the inmost corner of the angle of\nthe stable, and behind the thickest of the ivy bush, he straightened\nhimself up and compressed his lips, as he had done when the Smoutchies\nwere tying him up by the thumbs. He felt however that to beat Nipper\nDonnan he was ready to undergo anything--even this. No sacrifice was\ntoo great.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Come on, Cissy, and get it over--only don't be\ntoo long.\"\n\nCissy was thirteen, and tall for her age, but though fully a year\nyounger, Hugh John was tall also, so that when she came joyously\nforward and put her hands on his shoulders, their eyes were exactly on\na level.\n\n\"You needn't go shutting your eyes and holding your breath, as if it\nwere medicine. 'Tisn't so very horrid,\" said Cissy, with her hands\nstill on his shoulder.\n\n\"Go on!\" said Hugh John in a muffled voice, nerving himself for the\ncoming crisis.\n\nCissy's lips just touched his, rested a moment, and were gone.\n\nHugh John let out his breath with a sigh of relief like an explosion;\nthen he stepped back, and promptly wiped off love's gage with the\nsleeve of his coat.\n\n\"Hold on,\" cried Cissy; \"that isn't fair. You know it ain't!\"\n\nHugh John knew it and submitted.\n\nCissy swept the tumbled hair from about her eyes. She had a very red\nspot on either cheek; but she had made up her mind, and was going\nthrough with it properly now.\n\n[\"'WASN'T IT SPLENDID?'\"]\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" she said; \"I can easily do it over again--for\nkeeps this time, mind!\"\n\nThen she kissed him once, twice, and three times. It was nicer than\nkissing Janet Sheepshanks, he thought; and as for Prissy--well, that\nwas different too.\n\nA little hammer thumped in his heart, and made it go \"jumpetty-jump,\"\nas if it were lame, or out of breath, or had one leg shorter than the\nother. After all Ciss was the nicest girl there was, if she did behave\nstupidly and tiresomely about this. \"Just once?\" He would do it after\nall. It wasn't much to do--to give Cissy such a treat.\n\nSo he put his arms about her neck underneath her curls, pulled her\nclose up to him, and kissed her. It felt funny, but rather nice. He\ndid not remember doing that to any one since he was a little boy, and\nhis mother used to come and say \"Good-night\" to him. Then he opened\nhis arms and pushed Cissy away. They walked out through the orchard\nyards apart, as if they had just been introduced. Cissy's eyes were\nfull of the happiness of love's achievement. As for Hugh John, he was\ncrimson to the neck and felt infinitely degraded in his own\nestimation.\n\nThey came to the orchard wall, where there was a stile which led in\nthe direction of Oaklands. Cissy ran up the rude steps, but paused on\nthe top instead of going over. Hugh John was looking the other way.\nSomehow, do what he would, his eyes could not be brought to meet\nhers.\n\n\"Are you not coming?\" she said coaxingly.\n\n\"No,\" he answered, gruffly enough; \"to-morrow will do for Billy.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" she said softly. Her voice was almost a whisper.\n\nHugh John grunted inarticulately.\n\n\"Look here!\" she said, bending down till her eyes were on a level with\nhis chin. He could not help glancing up once. There was a mischievous\nsmile in them. It had never struck him before that Cissy was very\npretty. But somehow now he was glad that she was. Prissy was\nnice-looking too--but, oh! quiet different. He continued to look at\nCissy Carter standing with the stile between them.\n\n\"Wasn't it splendid!\" she said, still keeping her shining eyes on his.\n\n\"Oh, middling,\" said Hugh John, and turning on his heel he went into\nthe stable without even saying \"Good-bye.\" Cissy watched him with a\nhappy smile on her face. Love was her fetish--her Sambo Soulis--and\nshe had worshipped long in secret. Till now she had let the worm\nconcealment prey upon her cheek. True, it had not as yet affected her\nappetite nor kept her a moment awake.\n\nBut now all was different. Her heart sang, and the strangest thing was\nthat all the landscape, the fields and woods, and everything seemed to\nbe somehow painted in brighter colours. In fact, they looked just as\nthey do when you bend down and look at them through between your legs.\nYou know the way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. AN IMPERIAL BIRTHDAY.\n\n\nThe next day was General Napoleon Smith's birthday. Outwardly it\nlooked much like other days. There were not, as there ought to have\nbeen, great, golden imperial capital N's all over the sky. Nature\nindeed was more than usually calm; but, to strike a balance, there was\nexcitement enough and to spare in and about the house of Windy\nStandard. Very early, when it was not yet properly light, but only\nsort of misty white along the wet grass and streaky combed-out grey up\nabove in the sky, Prissy waked Sir Toady Lion, who promptly rolled\nover to the back of his cot, and stuck his funny head right down\nbetween the wall and the edge of the wire mattress, so that only his\nlegs and square sturdy back could be seen.\n\nToady Lion always preferred to sleep in the most curious positions. In\nwinter he usually turned right round in bed till his head was far\nunder the bed-clothes, and his fat, twinkly, pink toes reposed\npeacefully on the pillow. Nothing ever mattered to Toady Lion. He\ncould breathe through his feet just as well as through his mouth, and\n(as we have seen) much better than through his nose. The attention of\nprofessors of physiology is called to this fact, which can be\nestablished upon the amplest evidence and the most unimpeachable\ntestimony. In summer he generally rolled out of bed during the first\nhalf hour, and slept comfortably all the rest of the night on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Get up, Toady Lion,\" said his sister softly, so as not to waken Hugh\nJohn; \"it is the birthday.\"\n\n\"Ow don' care!\" grumbled Toady Lion, turning over and over three or\nfour times very fast till he had all the bed-clothes wrapped about him\nlike a cocoon; \"don' care wat it is. I'se goin' to sleep some more.\nDon't go 'prog' me like that!\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Prissy gently, to tempt him; \"we are going to give Hugh\nJohn a surprise, and sing a lovely hymn at his door. You can have my\nivory Prayer-book----\"\n\n\"For keeps?\" asked Toady Lion, opening his eyes with his first gleam\nof interest.\n\n\"Oh, no, you know that was mother's, and father gave it to me to take\ncare of. But you shall have it to hold in your hand while we are\nsinging.\"\n\n\"Well, then, can I have the picture of the anzel Michael castin' out\nthe baddy-baddy anzels and hittin' the Bad Black Man O-such-a-whack on\nthe head?\"\n\nPrissy considered. The print was particularly dear to her heart, and\nshe had spent a happy wet Saturday colouring it. But she did want to\nmake the birthday hymn a success, and Toady Lion had undeniably a fine\nvoice when he liked to use it--which was not often.\n\n\"All right,\" she said, \"you can have my 'Michael and the Bad Angels,'\nbut you are not to spoil it.\"\n\n\"Shan't play then,\" grumbled Toady Lion, who knew well the strength of\nhis position, and was as troublesome as a _prima donna_ when she knows\nher manager cannot do without her--\"shan't sing, not unless 'Michael\nand the Bad Angels' is mine to spoil if I like.\"\n\n\"But you won't--will you, dear Toady Lion?\" pleaded Prissy. \"You'll\nkeep it so nice and careful, and then next Saturday, when I have my\nweek's money and you are poor, I'll buy it off you again.\"\n\n\"Shan't promise,\" said the Obstinate Brat--as Janet, happily inspired,\nhad once called him after being worsted in an argument, \"p'rhaps yes,\nand p'rhaps no.\"\n\n\"Come on then, Toady Lion,\" whispered Prissy, giving him a hand and\ndeciding to trust to luck for the preservation of her precious print.\nToady Lion was often much better than his word, and she knew from\nexperience that by Saturday his financial embarrassments would\ncertainly be such that no reasonable offer was likely to be refused.\n\nToady Lion rose, and taking his sister's hand they went into her room,\ncarefully shutting the door after them. Here Prissy proceeded to\nequip Toady Lion in one of her own \"nighties,\" very much against that\nchorister's will.\n\n\"You see, pink flannel pyjams are not proper to sing in church in,\"\nshe whispered: \"now--you must hold your hymn-book so, and look up at\nthe roof when you sing--like the 'Child Samuel' on the nursery wall.\"\n\n\"Mine eyes don't goggle like his,\" said Toady Lion, who felt that\nNature had not designed him for the part, and who was sleepy and cross\nanyway. Birthdays were no good--except his own.\n\nIt happened that Janet Sheepshanks was going downstairs early to set\nthe maids to their morning work, and this is what she saw. At the\nclosed door of Hugh John's chamber stood two quaint little figures,\nclad in lawny white, one tall and slim, the other short and chubby as\na painted cherub on a ceiling. They had each white hymn-books\nreverently placed between their hands. Their eyes were raised\nheavenwards and their lips were red and parted with excitement.\n\nThe stern Scotswoman felt something suddenly strike her heart.\n\n\"Eh, sir,\" she said, telling the tale afterwards, \"the lassie\nPriscilla was sae like her mither, my puir bairn that is noo singing\npsalms wi' the angels o' God, that I declare, my verra heart stood\nstill, for I thocht that she had come back for yin o' the bairns. And,\noh! I couldna pairt wi' ony o' them noo. It wad fairly break my heart.\nAnd there the twa young things stood at the door, but when they began\nto sing, I declare I juist slippit awa' doon to the closet and grat\non the tap o' a cask o' paraffeen!\"\n\nAnd this is what Janet Sheepshanks heard them sing. It was not perhaps\nvery appropriate, but it was one of the only two hymns of which Toady\nLion knew the words; and I think even Mr. Charles Wesley, who wrote\nit, would not have objected if he had seen the angelic devotion on\nPrissy's face or the fraudulent cherub innocence shining from that of\nSir Toady Lion.\n\n\"Now, mind, your eyes on the crack of the door above,\" whispered\nPrissy; \"and when I count three under my breath--sing out for your\nvery life.\"\n\nToady Lion nodded.\n\n\"One--two--three!\" counted Prissy.\n\n    \"_Hark! the herald angels sing,\n    Glory to the new-born King,\n    Peace on earth and mercy mild,\n    God and sinners reconciled._\"\n\n\"What is 'weconciled'?\" asked Toady Lion, who must always ask\nsomething on principle.\n\n\"Oh, never mind now,\" whispered Prissy hastily; \"keep your eyes on the\ntop crack of the door and open your mouth wide.\"\n\n\"Don't know no more!\" said Toady Lion obstinately.\n\n\"Oh yes, you do,\" said Prissy, almost in tears; \"go on. Sing _La-La_,\nif you don't, and we'll soon be at the chorus, and you know that\nanyway!\"\n\nThen the voice of Prissy escaped, soaring aloft in the early gloom,\nand if any human music can, reaching the Seventh Sphere itself, where,\namid the harmonies of the universe, the Eternal Ear hearkens for the\nnote of sinful human praise.\n\nThe sweet shrill pipe of Toady Lion accompanied her like a heavenly\nlute of infinite sweetness. It was at this point that Janet made off\nin the direction of the paraffin barrel.\n\n    \"_Joyful all ye nations rise,\n    Join the triumph of the skies:\n    Universal nature, say,\n    'Christ the Lord is risen to-day!'_\"\n\nThe door opened, and the head of Hugh John appeared, his hair all on\nend and his pyjama jacket open at the neck. He was hitching up the\nother division of the suit with one hand.\n\n\"'Tain't Christmas, what's the horrid row? Shut it!\" growled he\nsleepily. Prissy made him the impatient sign of silence so well\nunderstood of children, and which means that the proceedings are not\nto be interrupted.\n\n\"Your birthday, silly!\" she said; \"chorus now!\" And Hugh John himself,\nwho knew the value of discipline, lined up and opened his mouth in the\nloud rejoicing refrain:--\n\n    \"_Hark! the herald angels sing,\n    Glory to the newborn King!_\"\n\nA slight noise behind made them turn round, and there the children\nbeheld with indignation the whole body of the servants grouped\ntogether on the landing, most of them with their handkerchiefs to\ntheir eyes; while Jane Housemaid who had none, was sobbing\nundisguisedly with the tears rolling down her cheeks, and vainly\nendeavouring to express her opinion that \"it was just beautiful--they\nwas for all the world like little angels a-praisin' God, and--_a-hoo!_\nI can't help it, no more I can't! And their mother never to see them\ngrowed up--her bein' in her grave, the blessed lamb!\"\n\n\"_I_ don't see nuffin to kye for,\" said Toady Lion unsympathetically,\ntrying to find pockets in Prissy's night-gown; \"it was a nice\nsing-song!\"\n\nAt this moment Janet Sheepshanks came on the scene. She had been\ncrying more than anybody, but you would never have guessed it. And\nnow, perhaps ashamed of her own emotion, she pretended great scandal\nand indignation at the unseemly and irregular spectacle, and drove the\nservants below to their morning tasks, being specially severe with\nJane Housemaid, who, for some occult reason, found it as difficult to\nstop crying as it had been easy to begin--so that, as Hugh John said,\n\"it was as good as a watering-can, and useful too, for it laid the\ndust on Jane's carpets ready for sweeping, ever so much better than\ntea-leaves.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. THE BANTAM CHICKENS.\n\n\nWhen Hugh John met Cissy Carter the first time after the incident of\nthe stile, it was in the presence of the young lady's father and\nmother. Cissy smiled and shook hands with the most serene and chilling\ndignity; but Hugh John blushed, and wore on his countenance an\nexpression of such deep and ingrained guilt and confusion, that, upon\ncatching sight of him, Mr. Davenant Carter called out, in his jolly\nstand-before-the-fire-with-his-hands-in-his-pockets' manner, \"Hillo,\nboy! what have you been up to--stealing apples, eh? Come! What is it?\nOut with it!\"\n\nWhich, when you think of it, was not exactly fitted to make our hero\nany more self-possessed. Mr. Davenant Carter always considered\nchildren as a rather superior kind of puppy dogs, which were\nspecially created to be condescended to and teased, in order to see\nwhat they would say and do. They might also be taught tricks--like\nmonkeys and parrots, only not so clever.\n\n\"Oh, Davenant,\" said his wife, \"do let the boy alone. Don't you see he\nis bashful before so many people?\"\n\nNow this was the last thing which ordinarily could be laid with\njustice to the charge of our hero; yet now he only mumbled and avoided\neverybody's eye, particularly Cissy's. But apparently that young lady\nhad forgotten all about the ivy bush at the back of the stable, for\nshe said quite loud out, so that all the room could hear her, \"What a\nlong time it is since we saw you at Oaklands, Hugh John--isn't it?\"\nThis sally added still more to Hugh John's confusion, and he could\nonly fall back upon his favourite axiom (which he was to prove the\ntruth of every day of his life as he grew older), that \"girls are\nfunny things.\"\n\nPresently Cissy said, \"Have you seen Sammy, mother; I wonder if he has\nfallen into the mill-dam. He went over there more than an hour ago to\nsail his new boat.\" Mild Mrs. Carter started up so violently that she\nupset all her sewing cotton and spools on the floor, to the delight of\nher wicked little pug, which instantly began pulling them about,\nshaking them, growling at them, and pretending they were rats that had\nbeen given him to worry.\n\n\"Oh, do you think so?--Run Cissy, run Hugh, and find him!\" Whereat\nCissy and Hugh John removed themselves. As soon as they were outside\nour hero found his tongue.\n\n\"How could you tell such a whopper? Of course he would not fall into\nthe water like a baby!\"\n\n\"Goos-ee gander,\" said Cissy briskly; \"of course not! I knew that very\nwell. But if I had not said something we should have had to stay there\nmoping among all those Grown-Ups, and doing nothing but talking proper\nfor hours and hours.\"\n\n\"But I thought you liked it, Cissy,\" said Hugh John, who did not know\neverything.\n\n\"Like it!\" echoed Cissy; \"I've got to _do_ it. And if they dreamed I\ndidn't like it, they'd think I hadn't proper manners, and make me stop\njust twice as long. Mother wants me to acquire a good society\nsomething-or-other, so that's why I've to stop and make tea, and\npretend to like to talk to Mr. Burnham.\"\n\n\"Oh--him,\" said Hugh John; \"he isn't half bad. And he's a ripping good\nwicket-keep!\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" retorted Cissy, \"that's all very well for you. He talks\nto you about cricket and W. G.'s scores--I've heard him. But he speaks\nto me in that peeky far-away voice from the back of his throat, like\nhe does in the service when he comes to the bit about 'young\nchildren'--and what do you think the _Creature_ says?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" said Hugh John, with a world-weary air, as if the\neccentricities of clergymen in silk waistcoats were among the things\nthat no fellow could possibly find out.\n\n\"Well, he said that he hoped the time would soon come when a young\nlady of so much decision of character (that's me!) would be able to\nassist him in his district visiting.\"\n\n\"What's 'decision of character' when he's at home?\" asked Hugh John\nflippantly.\n\n\"Oh, nothing--only one of the things parsons say. It doesn't mean\nanything--not in particular!\" replied the widely informed Cissy. \"But\ndid you ever hear such rot?\"\n\nAnd for the first time her eyes met his with a quaintly questioning\nlook, which somehow carried in it a reminiscence of the stile and the\nivy bush. Cissy's eyes were never quite (Hugh John has admitted as\nmuch to me in a moment of confidence)--never quite the same after the\nincident of the orchard. On this occasion Hugh John instantly averted\nhis own, and looked stolidly at the ground.\n\n\"Perhaps Mr. Burnham has heard that you went with medicine and stuff\nto the gipsy camp,\" he said after a pause, trying to find an\nexplanation of the apparently indefensible folly of his cricketing\nhero. Cissy had not thought of this before.\n\n\"Well, perhaps he had,\" she said, \"but that was quite different.\"\n\n\"How different?\" queried Hugh John.\n\n\"Well, that was only dogs and Billy Blythe,\" said Cissy, somewhat\nshamefacedly; \"that doesn't count, and besides I like it. Doing good\nhas got to be something you don't like--teaching little brats their\nduty to their godfathers and godmothers, or distributing tracts which\nonly make people stamp and swear and carry on.\"\n\n\"Isn't there something somewhere about helping the fatherless and the\nwidow?\" faltered Hugh John. He hated \"talking good,\" but somehow he\nfelt that Cissy was doing herself less than justice.\n\n\"Well, I don't suppose that the fox-terrier's pa does much for him,\"\nshe said gaily; \"but come along and I'll 'interjuce' you to your ally\nBilly Blythe.\"\n\nSo they walked along towards the camp in silence. It was a still,\nSunday-like evening, and the bell of Edam town steeple was tolling for\nthe six o'clock stay of work, as it had done every night at the same\nhour for over five hundred years. The reek of the burgesses'\nsupper-fires was going up in a hundred pillar-like \"pews\" of tall blue\nsmoke. Homeward bound humble bees bumbled and blundered along, drunk\nand drowsy with the heady nectar they had taken on board--strayed\nrevellers from the summer-day's Feast of Flowers. Delicate little blue\nbutterflies rose flurriedly from the short grass, flirted with each\nother a while, and then mounted into a yet bluer sky in airy wheels\nand irresponsible balancings.\n\n\"This is my birthday!\" suddenly burst out Hugh John.\n\nCissy stopped short and caught her breath.\n\n\"Oh no--it can't be;\" she said, \"I thought it was next week, and they\naren't nearly ready.\"\n\nWhereat Cissy Cartar began most incontinently and unexpectedly to cry.\nHugh John had never seen her do this before, though he was familiar\nenough with Prissy's more easy tears.\n\n\"Now don't you, Ciss,\" he said; \"I don't want anything--presents and\nthings, I mean. Just let's be jolly.\"\n\n\"Hu-uh-uh!\" sobbed Cissy; \"and Janet Sheepshanks told me it was next\nweek. I'm sure she did; and I set them so nicely to be ready in\ntime--more than two months ago, and now they aren't ready after all.\"\n\n\"What aren't ready?\" said Hugh John.\n\n\"The bantam chickens,\" sobbed Cissy; \"and they are lovely as lovely.\nAnd peck--you should just see them peck.\"\n\n\"I'd just as soon have them next week, or the next after that--rather\nindeed. Shut up now, Ciss. Stop crying, I tell you. Do you hear?\" He\nwas instinctively adopting that gruff masculine sternness which men\nconsider to be on the whole the most generally effective method of\ndealing with the incomprehensible tears of their women-kind. \"_I_\ndon't care if you cry pints, but I'll hit you if you won't stop! So\nthere!\"\n\nCissy stopped like magic, and assumed a distant and haughty expression\nwith her nose in the air, the surprising dignity of which was marred\nonly by the recurring spasmodic sniff necessary to keep back the\nmoisture which was still inclined to leak from the corners of her\neyes.\n\n\"I would indeed,\" said Hugh John, like all good men quickly remorseful\nafter severity had achieved its end. \"I'd ever so much rather have the\nnicest presents a week after; for on a regular birthday you get so\nmany things. But by next week, when you've got tired of them all, and\ndon't have anything new--that's the proper time to get a present.\"\n\n\"Oh, you _are_ nice,\" said Cissy impulsively, coming over to Hugh\nJohn and clasping his arm with both her hands. He did not encourage\nthis, for he did not know where it might end, and the open moor was\nnot by any means the ivy-grown corner of the stable. Cissy went on.\n\n\"Yes, you are the nicest thing. Only don't tell any body----\"\n\n\"I won't!\" said Hugh John, with deepest conviction.\n\n\"And I'll give you the mother too,\" continued Cissy; \"she is a perfect\ndarling, and won a prize at the last Edam show. It was only a second,\nbut everybody said that she ought by rights to have had the first.\nYes, and she would have got it too--only that the other old hen was a\ncousin of the judge's. That wasn't fair, was it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Hugh John, with instant emphasis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. THE GIPSY CAMP.\n\n\nAt this point a peculiar fragrance was borne to them upon the light\nwind, the far-blowing smell of a wood-fire, together with the odour of\nboiling and fragrant stew--a compound and delicious wild-wood scent,\nwhich almost created the taste by which it was to be enjoyed, as they\nsay all good literature must. There was also another smell, less\nidyllic but equally characteristic--the odour of drying paint. All\nthese came from the camp of the gipsies set up on the corner of the\ncommon lands of Windy Standard.\n\nThe gipsies' wood was a barren acre of tall, ill-nurtured Scotch firs,\nwith nothing to break their sturdy monotony of trunk right up to the\nspreading crown of twisted red branches and dark green spines.\nBeneath, the earth was covered with a carpet of dry and brown\npine-needles, several inches thick, soft and silent under the feet as\nvelvet pile. Ditches wet and dry closed in the place of sanctuary for\nthe wandering tribes of Egypt on all sides, save only towards the high\nroad, where a joggly, much-rutted cart track led deviously in between\nhigh banks, through which the protruding roots of the Scotch firs,\nknotted and scarred, were seen twisting and grappling each other like\na nest of snakes. Suddenly, between the ridges of pine-trees, the pair\ncame in sight of the camp.\n\n\"I declare,\" cried Hugh John, \"they are painting the waggons. I wish\nthey would let me help. I can slick it on like a daisy. Now I'm\ntelling you. Andrew Penman at the coach-works in Church Street showed\nme how. He says I can 'line' as well as any workman in the place. I'm\ngoing to be a coach-painter. They get bully wages, I tell you.\"\n\n\"I thought you were going to be a soldier,\" commented Cissy, with the\ncool and inviting criticism of the model domestic lady, who is always\non hand with a bucket of cold water for the enthusiasms of her\nmen-folk.\n\nHugh John remembered, saw his mistake, and shifted his ground all in\nthe twinkling of an eye; for of course a man of spirit ought never to\nown himself in the wrong--at least to a girl. It is a bad precedent,\noccasionally even fatal.\n\n\"Oh yes, of course I am going to be a soldier,\" he said with the\nhesitation of one who stops to think what he is going to say; \"but I'm\nto be a coach-painter in my odd time and on holidays. Besides,\nofficers get so little pay now-a-days, it's shameful--I heard my\nfather say. So one must do something.\"\n\n\"Oh, here's the terrier--pretty thing, I declare he quite knows\nme--see, Hugh John,\" cried Cissy, kneeling with delight in her eye,\nand taking hold of the little dog, which came bounding forward to meet\nher--stopping midway, however, to paw at its neck, to which the\nChianti wicker-work still clung tightly round the edge of the bandage.\n\nBilly Blythe came towards them, touching his cap as he did so in a\nhalf-military manner; for had he not a brother in the county militia,\nwho was the best fighter (with his fists) in the regiment, the pest of\nhis colonel, but in private the particular pet of all the other\nofficers, who were always ready to put their money on Gipsy Blythe to\nany amount.\n\n\"Yes, miss,\" he said; \"I done it. He's better a'ready, and as lively\nas a green grass-chirper. Never seed the like o' that ointment. 'Tis\nworth its weight in gold when ye have dogs.\"\n\nA tall girl came up at this moment, dusky and lithe, her face and neck\ntanned to a fine healthy brown almost as dark as saddle-leather, but\nwith a rolling black eye so full and piercing that even her complexion\nseemed light by comparison. She carried a back load of tinware of all\nsorts, and by her wearied air appeared to be returning to the\nencampment after a day's tramp.\n\n\"Ah, young lady and gentleman, sure I can see by your eyes that you\nare going to buy something from a poor girl--ribbons for the hair, or\nfor the house some nice collanders, saucepans, fish-pans, stew-pans,\npatty-pans, jelly-pans----\"\n\n[\"SHE CARRIED A BACK LOAD OF TINWARE.\"]\n\n\"Go 'way, Lepronia Lovell,\" growled Billy; \"don't you see that this is\nthe young lady that cured my dog?\"\n\n\"And who may the young gentleman be?\" said the girl. \"Certain I am\nI've seen him before somewhere at the back o' beyant.\"\n\n\"Belike aye, Lepronia, tha art a clever wench, and hast got eyes in\nthe back o' thee yead,\" said Billy, in a tone of irony. \"Do you not\nknow the son of Master Smith o' t' Windy Standard--him as lets us bide\non his land, when all the neighbours were on for nothing else but\nturning us off with never a rest for the soles of our feet?\"\n\n\"And what is his name?\" said the girl.\n\n\"Why, the same as his father of course, lass--what else?\" cried Billy;\n\"young Master Smith as ever was. Did you think it was Blythe?\"\n\n\"'Faith then, God forbid!\" said Lepronia, \"ye have lashin's of that\nname in them parts already. Sure it is lonesome for a poor orphan like\nme among so many Blythes; and good-looking young chaps some o' them\ntoo, and never a wan o' ye man enough to ask me to change my name, and\ngo to church and be thransmogrified into a Blythe like the rest of\nyez!\"\n\nSome of the gipsies standing round laughed at the boldness of the\ngirl, and Billy reddened. \"I'm not by way of takin' up with no Paddy,\"\nhe said, and turned on his heel.\n\n\"Paddy is ut,\" cried the girl indignantly after him, \"'faith now, and\nit wad be tellin' ye if ye could get a daycent single woman only half\nas good lookin' as me, to take as much notice av the likes o' ye as to\nkick ye out of her road!\"\n\nShe turned away, calling over her shoulder to Cissy, \"Can I tell your\nfortune, pretty lady?\"\n\nQuick as a flash, Cissy's answer came back.\n\n\"No, but I can tell yours!\"\n\nThe girl stopped, surprised that a maid of the Gentiles should tell\nfortunes without glass balls, cards, or even looking at the lines of\nthe hand.\n\n\"Tell it then,\" she said defiantly.\n\n\"You will live to marry Billy!\" she said.\n\nThen Lepronia Lovell laughed a short laugh, and said, \"Never while\nthere's a daycent scarecrow in the world will I set up a tent-stick\nalong with the likes of Billy Blythe!\"\n\nBut all the same she walked away very thoughtful, her basketful of\ntinware clattering at her back.\n\nAfter the fox-terrier had been examined, commented upon, and duly\ndressed, Billy Blythe walked with them part of the way homeward, and\nHugh John opened out to him his troubles. He told him of the feud\nagainst the town boys, and related all the manifold misdeeds of the\nSmoutchies. All the while Billy said nothing, but the twitching of his\nhands and a peculiarly covert look about his dusky face told that he\nwas listening intently. Scarcely had Hugh John come to the end of his\ntale when, with the blood mounting darkly to his cheeks, Billy turned\nabout to see if he were observed. There was no one near.\n\n\"We are the lads to help ye to turn out Nipper Donnan and all his\ncrew,\" he said. \"Him and his would soon make short work of us gipsies\nif they had the rights of castle and common. Why, Nipper's father is\nwhat they call a bailie of their burgh court, and he fined my father\nfor leaving his horses out on the roadside, while he went for a doctor\nwhen my mother was took ill a year past last November.\"\n\nHugh John had found his ally.\n\n\"There's a round dozen and more of us lads,\" continued Billy, \"that\n'ud make small potatoes and mince meat of every one of them, if they\nwas all Nipper Donnans--which they ain't, not by a long sight. I know\nthem. A fig for them and their flag! We'll take their castle, and\nwe'll take it too in a way they won't forget till their dying day.\"\n\nThe gipsy lad was so earnest that Hugh John, though as much as ever\nbent upon conquering the enemy, began to be a little alarmed.\n\n\"Of course it's part pretending,\" he said, \"for my father could put\nthem out if we were to tell on them. But then we won't tell, and we\nwant just to drive them out ourselves, and thrash them for stealing\nour pet lamb as well!\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Billy, \"don't be afraid; we won't do more than just give\nthem a blazing good hiding. Tell 'ee what, they'll be main sore from\ntop to toe before we get through with 'em!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. TOADY LION'S LITTLE WAYS.\n\n\nThus it was finally arranged. The castle was to be attacked by the\ncombined forces of Windy Standard and the gipsy camp the following\nSaturday afternoon, which would give them the enemy in their fullest\nnumbers. Notice would be sent, so that they could not say afterwards\nthat they had been taken by surprise. General Napoleon Smith was to\nwrite the letter himself, but to say nothing in it about his new\nallies. That, as Cissy put it, \"would be as good as a sixpenny\nsurprise-packet to them.\"\n\nSo full was Hugh John of his new plan and the hope, now almost the\ncertainty, of success, that when he went home he could not help\nconfiding in Prissy--who, like a model housewife, was seated mending\nher doll's stockings, while Janet Sheepshanks attended to those of the\nelder members of the household.\n\nShe listened with quick-coming breath and rising colour, till Hugh\nJohn thought that his own military enthusiasm had kindled hers.\n\n\"Isn't it prime?--we'll beat them till they can't speak,\" said Hugh\nJohn triumphantly. \"They'll never come back to our castle again after\nwe finish with them.\"\n\nBut Priscilla was silent, and deep dejection gnawed dully at her\nheart.\n\n\"Poor things,\" she said thoughtfully; \"perhaps they never had fathers\nto teach them, nor godfathers and godmothers to see that they learned\ntheir Catechism.\"\n\n\"Precious lot mine ever did for me--only one old silver mug!\" snorted\nHugh John.\n\nJust then Toady Lion came in.\n\n\"Oh, Hugh John,\" he panted, in tremulous haste to tell some fell\ntidings, \"I so sorry--I'se broked one of the cannons, and it's your\ncannon what I'se broked.\"\n\n\"What were you doing with my cannon?\" inquired his brother severely.\n\n\"I was juss playin' wif it so as to save my cannons, and a great bid\nstone fell from the wall and broked it all to bits. I beg'oo pardon,\nHugh John!\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Hugh John cheerfully; \"you can give me one of yours\nfor it.\"\n\nToady Lion stood a while silent, with a puzzled expression on his\nface.\n\n\"That's not right, Hugh John,\" he said seriously; \"I saided that I was\nsorry, and I begged 'oo pardon. Father says then 'oo must fordiv me!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll forgive you right enough,\" said Hugh John, \"after I get the\ncannon. It's all the same to me which cannon I have.\"\n\n\"But _your_ cannon is broked--all to little bits!\" said Toady Lion,\ntrying to impress the fact on his brother's memory.\n\n\"Well, another cannon,\" said Hugh John--\"I ain't particular.\"\n\n\"But the other cannons is all mine,\" explained Toady Lion, who has\nstrong ideas as to the rights of property.\n\n\"No matter--one of them is mine now!\" said his brother, snatching one\nout of his arms.\n\nToady Lion began to cry with a whining whimper that carried far, and\nwith which in his time he had achieved great things.\n\nIt reached the ear of Janet Sheepshanks, busy at her stocking-mending,\nas Toady Lion intended it should.\n\n\"I declare,\" she cried, \"can you not give the poor little boy what he\nwants? A great fellow like you pestering and teasing a child like\nthat. Think shame of yourself! What is the matter, Arthur George?\"\n\n\"Hugh John tooked my cannon!\" whimpered that young Machiavel.\n\n\"Haven't got your cannon, little sneak!\" said Hugh John under his\nbreath.\n\n\"Won't give me back my cannon!\" wailed Toady Lion still louder,\nhearing Janet beginning to move, and knowing well that if he only kept\nit up she would come out, and, on principle, instantly take his part.\nJanet never inquired. She had a theory that the elder children were\nalways teasing and oppressing the younger, and she acted upon\nit--acted promptly too.\n\n\"I wants--\" began Toady Lion in his highest key.\n\n\"Oh, take the cannon, sneak!\" said Hugh John fiercely, \"chucking\" his\nlast remaining piece of artillery at Toady Lion, for Janet was almost\nin the doorway now.\n\nToady Lion burst into a howl.\n\n\"Oo-oo-ooooh!\" he cried; \"Hugh John hitted me on the head wif my\ncannon----\"\n\n\"Oh, you bad boy, wait till I catch you, Hugh Picton Smith,\" cried\nJanet Sheepshanks, as the boy retreated precipitately through the open\nFrench window,--\"you don't get any supper to-night, rascal that you\nare, never letting that poor innocent lamb alone for one minute.\"\n\nIn the safety of the garden walk Hugh John shook his fist at the\nwindow.\n\n\"Oh, golly,\" he said aloud; \"just wait till Toady Lion grows up a bit.\nBy hokey, won't I take this out of him with a wicket? Oh no--not at\nall!\"\n\nNow Toady Lion was not usually a selfish little boy; but this day it\nhappened that he was cross and hot, also he had a tooth which was\nbothering him. And most of all he wanted his own way, and had a very\ngood idea how to get it too.\n\nThat same night, when Hugh John was wandering disconsolately without\nat the hour of supper, wondering whether Janet Sheepshanks meant to\nkeep her word, a small stout figure came waddling towards him. It was\nToady Lion with the cover of a silver-plated fish-server in his hand.\nIt was nearly full of a miscellaneous mess, such as children (and all\nhungry persons) love--half a fried sole was there, three large mealy\npotatoes, green peas, and a whole boiled turnip.\n\n\"Please, Hugh John,\" said Toady Lion, \"I'se welly solly I broked your\ncannon. I bringed you mine supper. Will 'oo forgive me?\"\n\n\"All right, old chap,\" said the generous hero of battles instantly,\n\"that's all right! Let's have a jolly feed!\"\n\nSo on the garden seat they sat down with the fish-cover propped\nbetween them, and ate their suppers fraternally and happily out of one\ndish, using the oldest implements invented for the purpose by the\nhuman race.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. SAINT PRISSY, PEACEMAKER.\n\n\nThis is the letter which, according to his promise, General Napoleon\nSmith despatched to the accredited leader of the Smoutchy boys--or, as\nthey delighted to call themselves, the Comanche Cowboys.\n\n     WINDY STANDARD HOUSE, BORDERSHIRE.\n\n     _Mistr. Nippr. Donnan, Esqr.,_\n\n     _DEAR SIR,--This is to warn you that on Saturday the 18th,\n     between the hours of ten in the morning and six in the evening,\n     we, the rightful owners of the Castle of Windy Standard, will\n     take possession of our proppaty. Prevent us at your peril. You\n     had better get out, for we're coming, and our motty is 'Smith\n     for ever, and No Quarter!'_\n\n     _Given under our hand and seal._\n\n     (_Signed_) _NAPOLEON SMITH_,\n\n     _General-Feeld-Marshall-Commanding._\n\n     _P.S.--I'll teach you to kick my legs with tacketty butes and\n     put me in nasty dunguns. Wait till I catch you, Nipper\n     Donnan._\n\nThe reply came back on a piece of wrapping paper from the butcher's\nshop, rendered warlike by undeniable stains of gore. It had, to all\nappearance, been written with a skewer, and contrasted ill with the\nblue official paper purloined out of Mr. Picton Smith's office, on\nwhich the challenge had been sent. It ran thus:----\n\n     _Matthew Donnan & Co.,\n     Butchers and Cattle Salesmen,\n     21 High Street, Edam, Bordershire._\n\n     _DEAR SIR.--Yours of the 13th received, and contents noted.\n     Come on, you stuck-up retches. We can fight you any day with\n     our one hand tied behind us. Better leave girls and childer at\n     home, for we meen fightin' this time--and no error.--We'll nock\n     you into eternal smash._\n\n     _Hoping to be favoured with a continuance of your esteemed\n     orders,--I have the honour to remain, Sir, your obedient\n     servant to command,_\n\n     _N. DONNAN._\n\nThe high contracting parties having thus agreed upon terms of mutual\nanimosity, to all appearance there remained only the arbitrament of\nbattle.\n\nBut other thoughts were working in the tender heart of Prissy Smith.\nShe had no sympathy with bloodshed, and had she been in her father's\nplace she would at once have given the town all their desires at any\nprice, in order that the peace might be kept. Deeply and sincerely she\nbewailed the spirit of quarrelling and bloodshed which was abroad. She\nhad her own intentions as to the enemy, Hugh John had his--which he\nhad so succinctly summed up in the \"favour of the 13th,\" acknowledged\nwith such businesslike precision by Mr. Nipper Donnan in his reply to\nGeneral Napoleon's blue official cartel.\n\nWithout taking any one into her confidence (not even Sammy Carter, who\nmight have laughed at her), Priscilla Smith resolved to set out on a\nmission of reconciliation to the Comanche Cowboys. Long and deeply she\nprepared herself by self-imposed penances for the work that was before\nher. She was, she knew, no Joan of Arc to lead an army in battle array\nagainst a cruel and taunting enemy. She was to be a St. Catherine of\nSiena rather, setting out alone and unfriended on a pilgrimage of\nmercy. She had read all she could lay her hands on about the tanner's\ndaughter, and a picture of the great barn-like brick church of San\nDominico where she had her visions, hung over the wash-stand in\nPrissy's little room, and to her pious eyes made the plain deal table\nseem the next thing to an altar.\n\nPrissy wanted to go and have visions too; and so, three times a day\nshe went in pilgrimage to the tool-house where the potatoes were\nstored, as being the next best thing to the unattainable San Dominico.\nThis was a roomy place more than half underground, and had a vaulted\nroof which was supported by pillars--the remains, doubtless, of some\nmuch more ancient structure.\n\nHere Prissy waited, like the Scholar Gipsy, for the light from heaven\nto fall; but, alas, the light refused to come to time. Well, then, she\nmust just go on without it as many another eager soul had done before\nher. There only remained to make the final preparations.\n\nOn the morrow therefore she waited carefully after early dinner till\nGeneral Smith and Toady Lion had gone off in the direction of the\nmill-dam. Then she took out the little basket which she had concealed\nin the crypt of San Dominico--that is to say in the potato house. It\nstood ready packed and covered with a white linen cloth.\n\nIt was a basket which had been prepared upon the strictest missionary\nmodels. She had no printed authorities which went the length of\ntelling her what provision for the way, what bribes and presents Saint\nCatherine carried forth to appease withal the enemies of her city and\ncountry. But there was on record the exact provision of the\nmission-chest of a woman, who in her time went forth to turn to\ngentleness the angry hearts of brigands and robbers--one Abigail, the\nwife of a certain churl of Maon, a village near to the roots of Mount\nCarmel.\n\nTrue, Prissy could not quite make up the tale of her presents on the\nsame generous and wholesale scale. She had to preach according to her\nstipend, like the Glasgow wife of the legend, who, upon the doctor\nordering her husband champagne and oysters, informed a friend that\n\"poor folk like us couldna juist gie Tammas champeen-an'-ighsters, but\nwe did the next best thing--we gied him whelks-an'-ginger-beer.\"\n\nSo since it might have attracted some attention, even on pastures so\nwell stocked as those of Mr. Picton Smith of Windy Standard, if Prissy\nhad taken with her \"five sheep ready dressed,\" she had to be content\nwith half of a sheep's-head-pie, which she had begged \"to give away\"\nfrom Janet Sheepshanks. To this she added a four pound loaf she had\nbought in Edam with her own money (Abigail's two hundred being\ndistinctly out of her reach)--together with the regulation cluster of\nraisins and cake of figs which were both well within her means. In\naddition, since Prissy was a strict teetotaler, she took with her a\nlittle apparatus for making tea, some sugar and cream from the pantry,\nand her largest and best set of dolls' cups and saucers.\n\nAll this occupied a good deal of room and was exceedingly heavy, so\nthat Prissy had very often to rest on the way towards the castle. She\nmight have failed altogether, but that she saw Mike raking the gravel\nof the path near the edge of the water, and asked him to carry the\nbasket for her over the stepping-stones.\n\nPrince Michael, who as he often remarked was \"spoiling for another\ntaste of Donnybrook,\" conveyed the basket over Edam Water for his\nyoung mistress, without the least idea of the strange quest upon which\nthe girl was going.\n\nHe laid it down and looked at the linen cover.\n\n\"Faix,\" he said, \"sure 'tis a long road to sind a young lady wid a\nheavy load like that!\"\n\nNow, this was his mode of inviting an explanation, but Prissy was far\ntoo wise to offer one. She merely thanked him and went on her way\ntowards the castle.\n\n\"Don't go near thim ruins till after Saturday, when we will clean\nevery dirty spalpeen out of the place like thunder on the mountains,\"\ncried Mike, who, like some other people, loved to round off his\nsentences with sounding expressions without troubling himself much as\nto whether they fitted the place or not.\n\n\"Thank you!\" cried Prissy over her shoulder, with a sweet and\ngrateful, but quite uninforming smile.\n\nShe continued on her way till Mike was out of sight, without altering\nher course from the straight road to the wooden bridge which led into\nthe town of Edam. Then at the edge of the hazel copse she came upon a\nsmall footpath which meandered through lush grass meadows and patches\nof the greater willow herb to the Castle of Windy Standard. The willow\nherb flourished in glorious red-purple masses on the ancient masonry\nof the outer defences, for it is a plant which loves above all things\nthe disintegrating lime of old buildings from which its crown of\nblossom shoots up three or four, or it may be even six feet.\n\nShe skirted the moat, green with the leaves of pond-weed floating like\nsmall veined eggs on the surface. From the sluggish water at the side,\niris and bog-bean stood nobly up, and white-lilies floated on the\nstill surface in lordly pride among the humbler wrack and scum of\nduckweed and water buttercup. The light chrome heads of\n\"Go-to-bed-John\" flaunted on the dryer bank beyond.\n\nPrissy eyed all these treasures with anxious glances.\n\n\"I want just dreadfully to gather you,\" she said. \"I hope all this\nwarring and battling will be over before you have done blooming, you\nnice waterside things.\"\n\nAnd indeed I agree with her, for there is nothing much nicer in the\nworld than wayside and riverside flowers--except the little children\nwho play among them; and nothing sweeter than a bairns' daisy-chain,\nsave the fingers which weave it, and the neck about which it hangs.\n\nPrissy had arrived within sight of the castle now. She saw the\nflaunting of the red republican flag which in staggery capitals\ncondemned her parent to instant dissolution. She stood a moment with\nthe basket on her arm in front of the great ruined gate. A sentry was\npacing to and fro there. Bob Hetherington was his name, and there were\nother lads and boys lounging and pretending to smoke in the deep\nembrasures and recesses of the walls. Clearly the castle was occupied\nin force by the enemy.\n\nPrissy stopped somewhat embarrassed, and set down her basket that she\nmight have a good look, and think what she was to do next. As she did\nso she caught the eye of Nosie Cuthbertson, a youth whom Nipper Donnan\npermitted in his corps because his father had a terrier which was\nundoubtedly the best ratter in Edam. But the privilege of association\nwith such a distinguished dog was dear at the price, for no meaner nor\nmore \"ill-set\" youth than Nosie Cuthbertson cumbered honest\nBordershire soil. Nosie was seated trying to smoke dry dock-leaf\nwrapped in newspaper without being sick, when his eye caught the trim\nlittle figure on the opposite side of the moat.\n\n\"Hey, boys!\" he cried, \"here's the Smith lass. Let's go and hit her!\"\n\nNow Master Nosie had not been prominent on the great day of the\nbattle of the Black Sheds, but he felt instinctively that against a\nsolitary girl he had at last some chance to assert himself. So he\nthrew away his paper cigar, and ran round the broken causeway to the\nplace where Prissy was standing.\n\n[\"'OH, PLEASE DON'T, SIR!'\"]\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" began Prissy sweetly, \"I've come to ask you not\nto fight any more. It isn't right, you know, and God will be angry.\"\n\nNosie Cuthbertson did not at all attend to the appeal so gently and\ncourteously made to him. He only caught Prissy by the hand, and began\ntwisting her wrist and squeezing her slender fingers till the joints\nground against each other, and Prissy bit her lips and was ready to\ncry with pain.\n\n\"Oh, _please_ don't, sir!\" she pleaded softly, trying to smile as at a\nfamous jest. \"I came because I wanted to speak to your captain, and\nI've brought a lot of nice things for you all. I think you will be\nsure to like them.\"\n\n\"Humbug,\" cried Nosie Cuthbertson, performing another yet more painful\ntwist, \"the basket's ours anyway. I captured it. Hey, Bob, catch hold\nof this chuck, while I give the girl _toko_--I'll teach her to come\nspying here about our castle!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. PRISSY'S PICNIC.\n\n\nBut just at this moment an important personage stalked through the\ngreat broken-down doorway by which kings and princes most magnificent\nhad once entered the ancient Castle of the Lorraines. He stood a\nmoment or two on the threshold behind Nosie Cuthbertson, silently\ncontemplating his courageous doings.\n\nPresently a little stifled cry escaped from Prissy, caused by one of\nNosie's refinements in torture, which consisted in separating her\nfingers and pulling two in one direction and two in the other. Nosie\nwas a youth of parts and promise, who had already proceeded some\ndistance on his way to the gallows.\n\nBut the Important Personage, who was no other than Nipper Donnan\nhimself, did not long remain quiescent. He advanced suddenly, seized\nNosie Cuthbertson by the scruff of the neck, kicked him several times\nseverely, tweaked his ear till it looked as if it had been constructed\nof the best india-rubber, and then ended by tumbling him into the\nmoat, where he disappeared as noiselessly as if he had fallen into\ngreen syrup.\n\n\"Now, what's all this?\" cried the lordly Nipper, whose doings among\nhis own no man dared to question, for reasons connected with health.\nAt the first sight of him Bob Hetherington had quietly shouldered his\nmusket, and begun pacing up and down with his nose in the air, as if\nhe had never so much as dreamed of going near Prissy's basket.\n\n\"What's all this, I say--you?\" demanded his captain.\n\n\"I don't know any bloomin' thing about it----\" began Bob, with whom\nignorance, if not honesty, was certainly the best policy.\n\n\"Salute!\" roared his officer; \"don't you know enough to salute when\nyou speak to me? Want to get knocked endways?\"\n\nSulkily Bob Hetherington obeyed.\n\n\"Well?\" said Nipper Donnan, somewhat appeased by the appearance of\nNosie Cuthbertson as he scrambled up the bank, with the green scum of\nduckweed clinging all over him. He was shaking his head and muttering\nanathemas, declaring what his father would do to Nipper Donnan, when\nwithin his heart he knew that first of all something very painful\nwould be done to himself by that able-bodied relative as soon as ever\nhe showed face at home.\n\n\"This girl she come to the drawbridge and hollered--that's all I\nknow!\" said the sentry, disassociating himself from any trouble as\ncompletely as possible. Bob felt that under the circumstances it was\nvery distinctly folly to be wise. \"I don't know what she hollered, but\nNosie he runs an' begins twisting her arm, and then the girl she\nbegins to holler again!\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to,\" said Prissy tremulously, \"but he _was_ hurting so\ndreadfully.\"\n\n\"Come here, you!\" shouted Nipper to the retiring Nosie. Whereupon that\nyoung gentleman, hearing the dreadful voice of his chief officer, and\nbeing at the time on the right side of the moat, did not pause to\nrespond, but promptly took to his heels in the direction of the town.\n\n\"Run after him and bring him back, two of you fellows! Don't dare come\nback without him!\" cried Nipper, and at his word two big boys detached\nthemselves from the doorposts in which the guard was kept, and dashed\nafter the deserter.\n\n\"Oh, don't hurt him--perhaps he didn't mean it!\" cried the universally\nsympathetic Prissy. \"He didn't hurt me much after all, and it is quite\nbetter now anyway.\"\n\nNipper Donnan could, as we know, be as cruel as anybody, but he liked\nto keep both the theory and practice of terror in his own hands.\nBesides, some possible far-off fragrance from another life stirred in\nhim when he saw the slim girlish figure of Prissy Smith, clad all in\nwhite with a large sun-bonnet edged with pale green, standing on the\nbank and appealing to him with eyes different from any he had ever\nseen. He wanted, he knew not why, to kick Nosie Cuthbertson--kick him\nmuch harder than he had done before he saw whom he was tormenting. He\nhad never particularly noticed any one's eyes before. He had thought\nvaguely that every one had the same kind of eyes.\n\n[\"THE RETURN OF THE TWO SWIFT FOOTMEN.\"]\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\" he said gruffly. For with Nipper and his\nclass emotion or shamefacedness of any kind always in the first\ninstance produces additional dourness.\n\nPrissy smiled upon him--a glad, confident smile. She was the daughter\nof one war chief, the sister of another, and she knew that it is\nalways best and simplest to treat only with principals.\n\n\"You know that I didn't come to spy or find out anything, don't you?\"\nshe said; \"only I was so sorry to think you were fighting with each\nother, when the Bible tells us to love one another. Why can't we all\nbe nice together? I'm sure Hugh John would if you would----\"\n\n\"Gammon--this is our castle,\" said Nipper Donnan sullenly, \"my father\nhe says so. Everybody says so. Your father has no right to it.\"\n\n\"Well, but--\" replied Prissy, with woman's gentle wit avoiding all\ndiscussion of the bone of contention, \"I'm sure you would let us come\nhere and have picnics and things. And you could come too, and play at\nsoldiers and marching and drills--all without fighting to hurt.\"\n\n\"Fighting is the best fun!\" snarled Nipper; \"besides, 'twasn't us that\nbegun it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" answered Prissy, \"wouldn't it be all the nicer of you if you\nwere to stop first?\"\n\nBut this Nipper Donnan could not be expected to understand. A\ndiversion was caused at this moment by the return of the two swift\nfootmen, with the culprit Nosie between them, doing the frog's march,\nand having his own experiences as to what arm-twisting meant.\n\n\"Cast him into the deepest dungeon beneath the castle moat!\" thundered\nthe brigand chief.\n\n\"Can't,\" said the elder of the two captors, one Joe Craig, the son of\nthe Carlisle carrier; \"can't--we couldn't get him out again if we\ndid!\"\n\n\"Well then,\"--returned the great chief, swiftly deciding upon an\nalternative plan, as if he had thought about it from the first, \"chuck\nhim down anywhere on the stones, and get Fat Sandy to sit on him.\"\n\n[\"HYDRAULIC PRESSURE.\"]\n\nJoe Craig obediently saluted, and presently sundry moans and sounds of\nexhausted breath indicated that Nosie Cuthbertson was being subjected\nto hydraulic pressure by the unseen tormentor whom Nipper Donnan had\ncalled Fat Sandy. Prissy felt that nothing she could say would for\nthe present lessen Master Nosie's griefs, so she went on to accomplish\nher purpose by other means.\n\n\"If you please, Mr. Captain,\" she said politely, \"I thought you would\nlike to taste our nice sheep's-head-pie. Janet makes it all out of her\nown head. Besides, there are some dee-licious fruits which I have\nbrought you; and if you will let me come in, I will make you some\nlovely tea?\"\n\nNipper Donnan considered, and at last shook his head.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"'tisn't regular. How do we know that you\naren't a spy?\"\n\n\"You could bind my eyes with a napkin, and----\"\n\n\"That's the thing!\" cried several of Nipper's followers, who scented\nsomething to eat, and who knew that the commissariat was the weak\npoint in the defences of the Castle of Windy Standard under the\nConsulship of Donnan.\n\n\"Well,\" said the chief, \"that's according to rule. Here, Timothy\nTracy, tell us if that is all right.\"\n\nWhereupon uprose Timothy Tracy, a long lank boy with yellowish hair\nand dull lack-lustre eyes, out of a niche in the wall and unfolded a\nnumber of \"The Wild Boys of New York.\" He rustled the flaccid,\nill-conditioned leaves and found the place.\n\n\"'Then Bendigo Bill went to the gateway of the stockade to interview\nthe emissary of the besiegers. With keen unerring eyes he examined\nhis credentials, and finding them correct, he took from the breast of\nhis fringed buckskin hunting-dress a handkerchief of fine Indian silk,\nand with it he swathed the eyes of the ambassador. Then taking the\nenvoy by the hand he led him past the impregnable defences of the\nComanche Cowboys into the presence of their haughty chief, who was\nseated with the fair Luluja beside him, holding her delicate hand, and\ninhaling the fragrance of a choice Havanna cigar through his noble\naquiline nose.'\n\n\"That's all it says,\" said Timothy Tracy, succinctly, and straightway\ncurled himself up again to resume his own story at the place where he\nhad left it off.\n\n\"Well, that's all pretty straight and easy. Nobody can say fairer nor\nthat,\" meditated Bob Hetherington.\n\n\"Shut up!\" said his chief; \"who asked for your oar? I'll knock the\nbloomin' nut off you if you don't watch out. Blindfold the emissary of\nthe enemy, and bring her before me into the inner court.\"\n\nAnd with this peremptory command, Nipper Donnan disappeared.\n\nBut the order was more easily given than obeyed. For not only could\nthe entire array of the Comanche Cowboys produce nothing even\ndistantly resembling Indian silk (which at any rate was a counsel of\nperfection), but what was worse, their pockets were equally destitute\nof common domestic linen. Indeed the proceedings would have fallen\nthrough at this point had not the ambassadress offered her own. This\nwas knotted round her brows by Joe Craig, with the best intentions in\nthe world.\n\nImmediately after completing the arrangement, he stepped in front of\nPrissy and said, thrusting his fist below her nose, \"Tell me if you\nsee anything--mind, true as 'Hope-you-may-Die!'\"\n\n\"I do see something, something very dirty,\" said Prissy, \"but I can't\nquite tell what it is.\"\n\n\"She _can_ see, boys,\" cried Joe indignantly, \"it's my hand.\"\n\nEvery boy recognised the description, and the handkerchief was once\nmore adjusted with greater care and precision than before, so that it\nwas only by the sense of smell that Prissy could judge of the\nproximity of Joe Craig's fingers.\n\n\"Please let me carry my basket myself--I've got my best china\ntea-service in it--and then I will be sure that it won't get broken.\"\n\nA licentious soldiery was about to object, but a stern command issued\nunexpectedly from one of the arrow-slits through which their chief had\nbeen on the watch.\n\n\"Give the girl the basket! Do you hear--you?\"\n\nAnd in this manner Prissy entered the castle, guarded on either side\nby soldiers with fixed (wooden) bayonets. And at the inner and outer\nports, the convoy was halted and asked for the pass-word.\n\n\"_Death!_\" cried Joe Craig, at the pitch of his voice.\n\n\"_Vengeance!_\" replied the sentry. \"Pass, '_Death_'!\"\n\nAt last Prissy felt the grass beneath her feet, and the handkerchief\nbeing slipped from her eyes, she found herself within the courtyard of\nthe castle. The captain of the band sat before her with a red sash\ntied tightly about his waist. By his side swung a butcher's steel,\nalmost as long and twice as dangerous as a sword.\n\nPrissy began her mission at once, to allow Captain Donnan no time to\norder her out again, or to put her into a dungeon, as he had done with\nHugh John.\n\n\"I think we had better have tea first,\" she said. \"Have you got a\nmatch-box?\"\n\nShe could not have taken a better line. Nipper Donnan stepped down\nfrom his high horse at once. He put his hand into his pocket. \"I have\nonly fusees,\" he said grandly, \"but perhaps they will do. You see\nregular smokers never use anything else.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, they will do perfectly,\" returned Prissy sweetly, \"it is just\nto light the spirit-lamp. See how nicely it fits in. Isn't it a\nbeauty? I got that from father on my birthday. Wasn't it nice of him?\"\n\nNipper Donnan grunted. He never found any marked difference between\nhis birthday and any other day. Nevertheless he stood by and assisted\nat the making of the tea, a process which interested him greatly.\n\n\"I shall need some more fresh spring water for so many cups,\" said\nPrissy, \"I only brought the full of the kettle with me.\"\n\nThe chief slightly waved a haughty hand, which instantly impelled Joe\nCraig forward as if moved by a spring. \"Bring some fresh water from\nthe well!\" he commanded.\n\nJoe Craig took the tin dipper, and was marching off. Prissy looked\ndistressed.\n\n\"What is it?\" said the robber chief. Now Prissy did not want to be\nrude, but she had her feelings.\n\n\"Oh, please, Mr. Captain,\" she said, \"his hands--I think he has\nperhaps been working----\"\n\nNipper Donnan had no fine scruples, but he respected them in such an\nunknown quantity as this dainty little lady with the green trimmed\nsun-bonnet and the widely-opened eyes.\n\n\"Tracy, fetch the water, you lazy jaundiced toad!\" he commanded. The\nsallow student rose unwillingly, and moved off with his face still\nbent upon the thrilling pages of \"The Wild Boys of New York,\" which he\nheld folded small in his hand for convenience of perusal.\n\nPresently the tea being made, the white cloth was laid on the grass,\nand the entire company of the Smoutchy Boys crowded about, always\nexcepting the sentinels at the east and west doors, who being on duty\ncould not immediately participate. The sheep's-head-pie, the bread,\nthe butter, the fruits were all set out in order, and the whole\npresented such an appearance as the inside of the Castle of Windy\nStandard had never seen through all its generations.\n\nPrissy conducted herself precisely as if she had been dispensing\nafternoon tea to callers in the drawing-room, as, since her last\nbirthday, her father had occasionally permitted her to do.\n\n\"Do you take sugar?\" she asked, delicately poising a piece in the\ndolls' sugar-tongs, and smiling her most politefully conventional\nsmile at Nipper Donnan.\n\nThe brigand chief had never been asked such a question before, and had\nno answer of the usual kind at hand. But he replied for all that.\n\n\"_Rather!_\" he cried in a burst, \"if the grocer's not lookin'!\"\n\n\"I mean in your tea! Do you take sugar in your tea?\"\n\nPrissy was still smiling.\n\nNipper appeared to acquiesce. Two knobs of sugar were dropped in. The\nwhipped cream out of the wide-mouthed bottle was spooned delicately on\nthe top, and with a yet more charming smile the cup was passed to him.\nHe held it between his finger and thumb, as an inquiring naturalist\nholds a rare beetle. Then he put it down on a low fragment of wall and\nlooked at it.\n\n\"One lump or two?\" queried Prissy again, graciously transferring her\nattentions to Joe Craig.\n\n\"Eh, what?\" ejaculated that warrior. Prissy repeated her question.\n\n\"As many as I can get!\" cried the boy.\n\nSo one by one the brigands were served, and the subdued look which\nrests upon a Sunday-school picnic at the hour of refreshment settled\ndown upon them. The Smoutchy boy is bad and bold, but he does not like\nyou to see him in the act of eating. His instinct is to get behind a\nwall, or into the thick of a copse and do it there. A similar feeling\nsends the sparrow with a larger crumb than the others into the\nseclusion of his nest among the ivy.\n\nNevertheless the bread and jam, the raisins, and the sheep's-head-pie\ndisappeared 'like snow off a dyke.' The wonder of the thimbleful cups,\ncontinually replenished, grew more and more surprising; and, winking\nslyly at each other the Smoutchies passed them in with a touch of\ntheir caps to be filled and refilled again and again. Prissy kept the\nkettle beside her, out of which she poured the water brought by\nTimothy Tracy as she wanted it. The golden colour of the tea\ndegenerated, but so long as a few drops of milk remained to mask the\nfraud from their eyes, the Smoutchies drank the warm water with equal\nrelish.\n\n\"Besides it's so much better for your nerves, you know!\" said Prissy,\nputting her action upon a hygienic basis.\n\nAt first the boys had been inclined to snatch the viands from the\ntable-cloth, and there was one footprint on the further edge. But the\niron hand of Nipper Donnan knocked two or three intruders sprawling,\nand after that the eatables were distributed as patiently and exactly\nas at a Lord Mayor's banquet.\n\n\"Please will you let that boy get up?--I think he must have been sat\nupon quite long enough now,\" said Prissy, who could not bear to listen\nto the uneasy groaning of the oppressed prisoner.\n\nThe chief granted the boon. The sitter and his victim came in and\nwere regaled amicably from one plate. \"Pieces\" and full cups of tea\nwere despatched to the distant sentinels, and finally the whole\ncompany was in the midst of washing up, when Prissy, who had been\nkneeling on the grass wiping saucers one by one, suddenly rose to her\nfeet with a little cry.\n\n\"Oh, it is so dreadful--I _quite_ forgot!\"\n\nThe Smoutchies stood open-mouthed, some holding dishes, some with\nbelated pieces of pie, some only with their hands in their pockets,\nbut all waiting eagerly for the revelation of the dreadful thing which\ntheir hostess had forgotten.\n\n\"Why, we forgot to say grace!\" she cried--\"well, anyway I am glad I\nremembered in time. We can say it now. Who is the youngest?\"\n\nThe boys all looked guiltily at each other. Prissy picked out a small\nboy of stunted aspect, but whose face was old and wizened. He had just\nput a piece of tobacco into his mouth to take away the taste of the\ntea.\n\n\"You say it, little boy,\" she said pointedly, and shut her eyes for\nhim to begin.\n\nThe boy gasped, glanced once at his chief, and made a bolt for the\ndoor, through which he had fled before the sentinels had time to stop\nhim. At the clatter Prissy opened her eyes.\n\n\"What is the matter with that boy? Couldn't he say grace? Didn't he\nremember the beginning? Well, you say it then----\"\n\nNipper Donnan shook his head. He had a fine natural contempt for all\nreligious services in the abstract, but when one was brought before\nhim as a ceremony, his sense of discipline told him that it must\nsomehow be valuable.\n\n\"Better say it yourself,\" he suggested.\n\nWhereat Prissy devoutly clasped her hands and shut her eyes.\n\nThere was a smart smack and something fell over. Prissy opened her\neyes, and saw a boy sprawling on the grass.\n\n\"Right,\" said Nipper Donnan cheerfully, \"go ahead--Joe Craig laughed.\nI'll teach him to laugh except when I tell him to.\"\n\nSo Prissy again proceeded with a grace of her own composition:\n\n    \"_God bless our table,\n      Bless our food;\n    And make us stable,\n      Brave and good._\"\n\nAfter all was over Prissy left the Castle of Windy Standard, without\nindeed obtaining any pledge from the chief of the army of occupation,\nbut not without having done some good. And she went forth with dignity\ntoo. For not only did the robber chieftain provide her with an escort,\nbut he ordered the ramparts to be manned, and a general salute to be\nfired in her honour.\n\nPrissy waved her hand vigorously, and had already proceeded a little\nway towards the stepping-stones, when she stopped, laid down her\nbasket, and ran back to the postern gate. She took her little\ntortoise-shell card-case out of her pocket.\n\n\"Oh, I was nearly forgetting--how dreadfully rude of me!\" she said,\nand forthwith pulled out a card on which she had previously written\nvery neatly:\n\n    +---------------------------------------+\n    |                                       |\n    |     _Miss Priscilla Smith_            |\n    |                                       |\n    |_At Home Every Day_                    |\n    +---------------------------------------+\n\nShe laid it on the stones, and tripped away. \"I'm sorry I have not my\nbrother's card to leave also,\" she said, looking up at the brigand\nchief, who had been watching her curiously from a window.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Nipper Donnan, \"we shall be pleased to see him if he drops\nin on Saturday--or any other time.\"\n\nThen he waited till the trim white figure was some distance from the\ngateway before he took his cap from his head and waved it in the air.\n\n\"Three proper cheers for the little lady!\" he cried.\n\nAnd the grim old walls of the Castle of Windy Standard never echoed to\na heartier shout than that with which the Smoutchy boys sped Miss\nPriscilla Smith, the daughter of their arch enemy, upon her homeward\nway.\n\nPrissy poised herself on tiptoe at the entrance of the copse, and blew\nthem a dainty collective kiss from her fingers.\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" she cried, \"you are very kind. Come and see me\nsoon--and be sure you stop to tea.\"\n\nAnd with that she tripped swiftly away homeward with an empty basket\nand a happy heart.\n\nThat night in her little room before she went to sleep she read over\nher favourite text, \"Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be\ncalled the children of God.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" she said, \"I should so like to be one some day.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.\n\n\nSaturday morning dawned calm and clear after heavy rain on the hills,\nwith a Sabbath-like peace in the air. The smoke of Edam rose straight\nup into the firmament from a hundred chimneys, and the Lias Coal Mine\ncontributed a yet taller pillar to the skies, which bushed out at the\ntop till it resembled an umbrella with a thick handle. Hugh John had\nbeen very early astir, and one of his first visits had been to the\ngipsy camp, where he found Billy Blythe with several others all clad\nin their tumbling tights, practising their great Bounding Brothers'\nact.\n\n\"Hello,\" cried Hugh John jovially, \"at it already?\"\n\n\"The mornin's the best time for suppling the jints!\" answered Billy\nsententiously; \"ask Lepronia Lovell, there. She should know with all\nthem tin pans going clitter-clatter on her back.\"\n\n\"I'll be thankin' ye, Billy Blythe, to kape a tight holt on the slack\no' that whopper jaw of yours. It will be better for you at supper-time\nthan jeerin' at a stranger girl, that is arnin' her bite o' bread\ndaycent. And that's a deal more than ye can do, aye, or anny wan like\nye!\"\n\nAnd with these brave words, Lepronia Lovell went jingling away.\n\nThe Bounding Brothers threw themselves into knots, spun themselves\ninto parti-coloured tops, turned double and treble somersaults, built\nhuman pyramids, and generally behaved as if they had no bones in any\npermanent positions throughout their entire bodies. Hugh John stood by\nin wonder and admiration.\n\n\"Are you afraid?\" cried Billy from where he stood, arching his\nshoulders and swaying a little, as one of the supporters of the\npyramid. \"No?--then take off your boots.\" Hugh John instantly stood in\nhis stocking soles.\n\n\"Up with him!\" And before he knew it, he was far aloft, with his feet\non the shoulders of the highest pair, who supported him with their\nright and left hands respectively. From his elevated perch he could\nsee the enemy's flag flaunting defiance from the topmost battlements\nof the castle.\n\nAs soon as he reached the ground he mentioned what he had seen to\nBilly Blythe.\n\n\"We'll have it low and mean enough this night as ever was, before the\nedge o' dark!\" said Billy, with a grim nod of his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rains of the night had swelled the ford so that the\nstepping-stones were almost impracticable--indeed, entirely so for the\nshort brown legs of Sir Toady Lion. This circumstance added greatly to\nthe strength of the enemy's position, and gave the Smoutchies a\ndecided advantage.\n\n\"They can't be at the castle all the time,\" said Billy; \"why not let\nmy mates and me go in before they get there? Then we could easily keep\nevery one of them out.\"\n\nThis suggestion much distressed General Smith, who endeavoured to\nexplain the terms of his contract to the gipsy lad. He showed him that\nit would not be fair to attack the Smoutchies except on Saturday,\nbecause at any other time they could not have all their forces in the\nfield.\n\nBilly thought with some reason that this was simple folly. But in time\nhe was convinced of the wisdom of not \"making two blazes of the same\nwasps' byke,\" as he expressed it.\n\n\"Do for them once out and out, and be done with it!\" was his final\nadvice.\n\nHugh John could not keep from thinking how stale and unprofitable it\nwould be when all the Smoutchies had been finally \"done for,\" and when\nhe did not waken to new problems of warfare every morning.\n\nAccording to the final arrangements the main attack was to be\ndeveloped from the broadest part of the castle island below the\nstepping-stones. There were two boats belonging to the house of Windy\nStandard, lying in a boat-house by the little pier on the way to\nOaklands. For security these were attached by a couple of padlocks to\na strong double staple, which had been driven right through the solid\nfloor of the landing-stage.\n\nThe padlocks were new, and the whole appeared impregnable to the\nsimple minds of the children, and even to Mike and Peter Greg. But\nBilly smiled as he looked at them.\n\n\"Why, opening them's as easy as falling off a stool when you're\nasleep. Gimme a hairpin.\"\n\nBut neither Prissy nor Cissy Carter had yet attained to the dignity of\nhaving their hair done up, so neither carried such a thing about with\nthem. Business was thus at a standstill, when Hugh John called to\nPrissy, \"Go and ask Jane Housemaid to give us one.\"\n\n\"A good thick 'un!\" called Billy Blythe after her.\n\nThe swift-footed Dian of Windy Standard had only been away a minute or\ntwo before she came flying back like the wind.\n\n\"She-won't-give-us-any-unless-we-tell-her-what-it-is-for!\" she panted,\nall in one long word.\n\n\"Rats!\" said Hugh John contemptuously, \"ask her where she was last\nFriday week at eleven o'clock at night!\"\n\nThe Divine Huntress flitted away again on winged feet, and in a trice\nwas back with three hairpins, still glossy from their recent task of\nsupporting the well-oiled hair of Jane Housemaid.\n\nWith quick supple hand Billy twisted the wire this way and that, tried\nthe padlock once, and then deftly bent the ductile metal again with a\npair of small pincers. The wards clicked promptly back, and lo! the\npadlock was hanging by its curved tongue. The other was stiffer with\nrust, but was opened in the same way. The besiegers were thus in\npossession of two fine transports in which to convey their army to the\nscene of conflict.\n\nIt was the plan of the General that the men under Billy Blythe should\nfill the larger of the two boats, and drop secretly down the left\nchannel till they were close under the walls of the castle. The enemy,\nbeing previously alarmed by the beating of drums and the musketry fire\non the land side, would never expect to be taken in the rear, and\nprobably would not have a single soldier stationed there.\n\nIndeed, towards the Edam Water, the walls of the keep rose thirty or\nforty feet into the air without an aperture wide enough to thrust an\narm through. So that the need of defence on that side was not very\napparent to the most careful captain. But at the south-west corner,\none of the flanking turrets had been overthrown, though there still\nremained several steps of a descent into the water. But so high was\nthe river on this occasion, that it lapped against the masonry of the\nouter defences. To this point then, apparently impregnable, the\nformidable division under Billy Blythe was to make its way.\n\nThere was nothing very martial about the appearance of these sons of\nthe tent and caravan.\n\nThe Bounding Brothers wore their trick dresses, and as for the rest,\nthey were simply and comprehensively arrayed in shirt and trousers.\nNot a weapon, not a sash, not a stick, sword, nor gun broke the\nharmonious simplicity of the gipsy army.\n\nYet it was evident that they knew something which gave them secret\nconfidence, for all the time they were in a state of high glee, only\npartially suppressed by the authority of their leader, and by the\nnecessity for care in manning the boat with so large a crew. There\nwere fourteen who were to adventure forth under Billy's pennon.\n\nTo the former assailants of the Black Sheds there had been added a\nstout and willing soldier from the gardens of Windy Standard,--a boy\nnamed Gregory (or more popularly Gregory's Mixture), together with a\nforester lad, who was called Craw-bogle Tam from his former occupation\nof scaring the crows out of the corn. Sammy Carter had been cashiered\nsome time ago by the Commander-in-chief, but nevertheless he appeared\nwith three cousins all armed with dog-whips, which Sammy assured Hugh\nJohn were the deadliest of weapons at close quarters. Altogether it\nwas a formidable array.\n\nThe boat for the attack on the land side was so full that there\nremained no room for Toady Lion. That young gentleman promptly sat\ndown on the landing-stage, and sent up a howl which in a few moments\nwould certainly have brought down Janet Sheepshanks and all the\ncurbing powers from the house, had he not been committed to the care\nof Prissy, with public instructions to get him some toffy and a\nprivate order to take him into the town, and keep him there till the\nstruggle was over.\n\nPrissy went off with Sir Toady Lion, both in high glee.\n\n\"I'se going round by the white bwidge--so long, everybody! I'll be at\nthe castle as soon as you!\" he cried as he departed.\n\nHugh John sighed a sigh of relief when he saw them safely off the\nmuster-ground. Cissy, however, was coming on board as soon as ever the\nboat was ready to start. She had been posted to watch the movements of\nthe household of Windy Standard, and would report at the last moment.\n\n\"All right,\" she cried from her watch-tower among the whins, \"Prissy\nand Toady Lion are round the corner, and Janet Sheepshanks has just\ngone into the high garden to get parsley.\"\n\n\"Up anchors,\" cried Hugh John solemnly, \"the hour has come!\"\n\nMike and Billy tossed the padlock chains into the bottom of the boats\nand pushed off. There were no anchors, but the mistake was permissible\nto a simple soldier like General Napoleon Smith.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. TOADY LION'S SECOND LONE HAND.\n\n\nEdam Water ran swiftly, surging and pushing southward on its way to\nthe sea. It was brown and drumly with a wrack of twigs and leaves,\nsnatched from the low branches of the hazels and alders which fringed\nits banks. It fretted and elbowed, frothing like yeast about the\nlanding-place from which the two boat-loads were to set out for the\nattack.\n\nGeneral Napoleon Smith, equipped with sword and sash, sat in the stern\nof the first, in order to steer, while Prince Michael O'Donowitch\nstood on the jetty and held the boat's head. The others sat still in\ntheir places till the General gave the word. The eager soldiery vented\ntheir feelings in a great shout. Cissy Carter took her place with a\nflying leap just as the rope was cast off, and the fateful voyage\nbegan.\n\nAt first there was little to be done save in the way of keeping the\nvessel's head straight, for the Edam Water, swirling and brown with\nthe mountain rains, hurried her towards the island with almost too\ngreat speed. With a rush they passed the wide gap between the\nunsubmerged stones of the causeway, at which point the boldest held\nhis breath. The beach of pebbles was immediately beyond. But they were\nnot to be allowed to land without a struggle; for there, directly on\ntheir front, appeared the massed forces of the enemy, occupying the\nhigh bluff behind, and prepared to prevent the disembarkation by a\ndesperate fusillade of stones and turf.\n\nIt was in this hour of peril that the soldierly qualities of the\nleader again came out most strongly.\n\nHe kept the boat's head straight for the shore, as if he had been\ngoing to beach her, till she was within a dozen yards; then with a\nquick stroke of his steering oar he turned her right for the willow\ncopses which fringed the island on the eastern side. The water had\nrisen, so that these were sunk to half their height in the\nquick-running flood, and their leaves sucked under with the force of\nthe current. But behind there was a quiet backwater into which Hugh\nJohn ran his vessel head on till she slanted with a gentle heave up on\nthe green turf.\n\n\"Overboard every man!\" he cried, and showed the example himself by\ndashing into the water up to the knees, carrying the blue ensign of\nhis cause. The enemy had not expected this rapid flank movement, and\nwaited only till the invaders had formed in battle array to retreat\nupon the castle, fearful perhaps of being cut off from their\nstronghold.\n\nGeneral-Field-Marshal Smith addressed his army.\n\n\"Soldiers,\" he said, \"we've got to fight, and it's dead earnest this\ntime, mind you. We're going to lick the Smoutchies, so that they will\nstay licked a long time. Now, come on!\"\n\nThis brief address was considered on all hands to be a model effort,\nand worthy of the imitation of all generals in the face of the enemy.\nThe most vulnerable part of the castle from the landward side was\nundoubtedly the great doorway--an open arch of some six feet wide,\nwhich, however, had to be approached under a galling cross fire from\nthe ports at either side and from the lintel above.\n\n\"It's no use wasting time,\" cried the General; \"follow me to the\ndoor.\"\n\nAnd with his sword in his hand he darted valiantly up the steep\nincline which led to the castle. Cissy Carter charged at his left\nshoulder also sword in hand, while Mike and Peter, with Gregory's\nMixture and the Craw Bogle, were scarcely a step behind.\n\nStones and mortar hailed down upon the devoted band; sticks and clods\nof turf struck them on their shoulders and arms. But with their teeth\nclenched and their heads bent low, the storming party rushed\nundauntedly upon their foes.\n\nThe Smoutchies had built a breast-work of driftwood in front of the\ngreat entrance, but it was so flimsy that Mike and his companions\nkicked it away in a moment--yet not before General Smith, light as a\nyoung goat, had overleaped it and launched himself solitary on the\nfoe. Then, with the way clear, it was cut and thrust from start to\nfinish.\n\nFirst among the assailants General Smith crossed swords with the great\nNipper Donnan himself. But his reserves had not yet come up, and so he\nwas beaten down by three cracks on the head received from different\nquarters at the same time. But like Witherington in the ballad, he\nstill fought upon his knees; and while Prince Michael and Gregory's\nMixture held the enemy at bay with their stout sticks, the stricken\nHugh John kept well down among their legs, and used his sword from\nunderneath with damaging effect.\n\n\"Give them the point--cold steel!\" he cried.\n\n\"Cowld steel it is!\" shouted Prince Michael, as he brought down his\nblackthorn upon the right ear of Nipper Donnan.\n\n\"Cauld steel--tak' you that!\" cried Peter Greg the Scot as he let out\nwith his left, and knocked Nosey Cuthbert over backwarks into the hall\nof the castle.\n\nThus raged in front the heady fight; and thus with their faces to the\nfoe and their weapons in their hands, we leave the vanguard of the\narmy of Windy Standard, in order that for a little we may follow the\nfortunes of the other divisions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYes, divisions is the word, that is to say Billy Blythe's gipsy\ndivision and--Sir Toady Lion.\n\nFor once more Toady Lion was playing a lone hand.\n\nSo soon as Prissy and he had been left behind, we regret to be obliged\nto report that the behaviour of the distinguished knight left much to\nbe desired.\n\n\"Don't be bad, Toady Lion,\" said his sister, gently taking him by the\nhand; \"come and look at nice picture-books.\"\n\n\"Will be bad,\" growled Toady Lion, stamping his little foot in\nimpotent wrath; \"doan want t' look at pitchur-books--want to go and\nfight! And I will go too, so there!\"\n\nAnd in his fiery indignation he even kicked at his sister Prissy, and\nthrew stones after the boat in which the expedition had sailed. The\ngipsy division, which was to wait till they heard the noise of battle\nroll up from the castle island before cutting loose, took pity on Sir\nToady Lion, and but for the special nature of the service required of\nthem, they would, I think, have taken him with them.\n\n\"That's a rare well-plucked little 'un!\" cried Joe Baillie. \"See how\nhe shuts his fists, and cuts up rough!\"\n\n\"A little man!\" said the leader encouragingly; \"walks into his\nsister's shins, don't he, the little codger!\"\n\n\"Let me go wif you, please,\" pleaded Toady Lion; \"I'll kill you\nunless!--Kill you every one!\" And his voice was full of bloodshed.\n\n\"Last time 'twas me that d'livered Donald, when they all runned away\nor got took prisoner; and now they won't even take me wif them!\"\n\nBilly regretfully shook his head. It would not do to be cumbered with\nsmall boys in the desperate mission on which they were going. The hope\nwas forlorn enough as it was.\n\n\"Wait till we come back, little 'un,\" he said kindly; \"run away and\nplay with your sister.\"\n\nToady Lion stamped on the ground more fiercely than ever.\n\n\"Shan't stop and play wif a girl. If you don't let me come, I shall\nkill you.\"\n\nAnd with sentiments even more discreditable, he pursued their boat as\nlong as he could reach it with volleys of stones, to the great delight\nof the gipsy boys, who stimulated him to yet more desperate exertions\nwith cries of \"Well fielded!\" \"Chuck her in hard!\" \"Hit him with a big\none!\" While some of those in the stern pretended to stand shaking in\ndeadly fear, and implored Toady Lion to spare them because they were\norphans.\n\n\"Shan't spare none--shall kill 'oo every one!\" cried the angry Toady\nLion, lugging at a bigger stone than all, which he could not lift\nabove three inches from the ground.\n\n\"Will smass 'oo with this, Billy Blythe--bad Billy!\" he exclaimed, as\nhe wrestled with the boulder.\n\n\"Oh, spare me--think of my family, Toady Lion, my pore wife and\nchilder,\" pleaded Billy hypocritically.\n\n\"'Oo should have finked of 'oo fambly sooner!\" cried Toady Lion,\nstaggering to the water's edge with the great stone.\n\nBut at this moment the noise of the crying of those warring for the\nmastery came faintly up from the castle island. The rope that had been\npassed through the ring on the landing-stage and held ready in the\nhand of Billy Blythe, was loosened, and the second part of the\nbesieging expedition went down with the rushing spate which reddened\nEdam Water. And as they fell away Billy stood up and called for three\ncheers for \"little Toady Lion, the best man of the lot.\"\n\nBut Toady Lion stood on the shore and fairly bellowed with impotent\nrage, and the sound of his crying, \"I'll kill 'oo! I'll kill 'oo\ndead!\" roused Janet Sheepshanks, who was taking advantage of her\nmaster's absence to carry out a complete house-cleaning. She left the\nblanket-washing to see what was the matter. But Toady Lion, angry as\nhe was, had sense enough to know that if Janet got him, he would be\nsuperintended all the morning. So with real alacrity he slipped aside\ninto the \"scrubbery,\" and there lay hidden till Janet, anxious that\nher maids should not scamp their house-work, was compelled to hurry\nback to the laundry to see that the blankets were properly washed.\n\nAfter this there was but one thing to do, and so the second division,\nunder Sir Toady Lion, did it. He resolved to turn the enemy's flank,\nand attack him with reinforcements from an entirely unexpected\nquarter. So, leaving Prissy to her own devices, he took to his heels,\nand his fat legs carried him rapidly in the direction of the town of\nEdam. Difficulties there were of course, such as the barrier of the\nwhite lodge gate, where old Betty lay in wait for him.\n\nBut Toady Lion circumnavigated Betty by going to the lodge-door and\nshouting with all his might, \"Betty, come quick, p'raps they's some\nsoldiers comin' down the road--maybe Tom's comin', 'oo come and look.\"\n\n\"Sodjers--where?--what?\" cried old Betty, waking up hastily from her\ndoze, and fumbling in her pocket for the gate-key.\n\nToady Lion was at her elbow when she undid the latch. Toady Lion\ncharged past her with a yell. Toady Lion it was who from the safe\nmiddle of the highway made the preposterous explanation, \"Oh no, they\nisn't no soldiers. 'Tis only a silly old fish-man wif a tin trumpet.\"\n\n\"Come back, sir, or I'll tell your father! Come back at once!\" cried\nold Betty.\n\nBut she might shake her head and nod with her nut-cracker chin till\nthe black beads on her lace \"kep\" tinkled. All was in vain. Toady Lion\nwas out of reach far down the dusty main road along which the Scots\nGreys had come the day that Hugh John became a soldier. Toady Lion was\na born pioneer, and usually got what he wanted, first of all by dint\nof knowing exactly what he did want, and then \"fighting it out on\nthat line if it took all summer\"--or even winter too.\n\nThe road to the town of Edam wound underneath trees great and tall,\nwhich hummed with bees and gnats that day as Toady Lion sped along,\nhis bare feet \"plapping\" pleasantly in the white hot dust. He was\nfurtively crying all the time--not from sorrow but with sheer\nindignation. He hated all his kind. He was going to desert to the\nSmoutchies. He would be a Comanche Cowboy if they would have him,\nsince his brother and Cissy Carter had turned against him. Nobody\nloved him, and he was glad of it. Prissy--oh! yes, but Prissy did not\ncount. She loved everybody and everything, even stitching and dollies,\nand putting on white thread gloves when you went into town. So he ran\non, evading the hay waggons and red farm-carts without looking at\nthem, till in a trice he had crossed Edam Bridge and entered the\ntown--in the glaring streets and upon the hot pavement of which the\nsunshine was sleeping, and which on Saturday forenoon had more than\nits usual aspect of enjoying a perpetual siesta.\n\nThe leading chemist was standing at his door, wondering if the rustic\nwho passed in such a hurry could actually be on the point of entering\nthe shop of his hated rival. The linen-draper at the corner under the\ntown clock was divided between keeping an eye on his apprentices to\nsee that they did not spar with yard sticks, and mentally criticising\nthe ludicrous and meretricious window-dressing of his next-door\nneighbour.\n\nNone of them cared at all for the small dusty boy with the\ntear-furrowed countenance who kept on trotting so steadily through the\ntown, turned confidently up the High Street, and finally dodged into\nthe path which led past the Black Sheds to the wooden bridge which\njoined the castle island to the butcher's parks. As he crossed the\ngrass Toady Lion heard a wrathful voice from somewhere calling loudly,\n\"Nipper! Nipper-r-r-r! Oh, wait till I catch you!\"\n\nFor it chanced that this day the leading butcher in Edam was without\nthe services of both his younger assistants--his son Nipper and his\nmessage boy, Tommy Pratt. Mr. Donnan had a new cane in his hand, and\nhe was making it whistle through the air in a most unpleasant and\nsuggestive manner.\n\n\"Get away out of my field, little boy--where are you going? What are\nyou doing there?\"\n\nThe question was put at short range now, for all unwittingly Sir Toady\nLion had almost run into butcher Donnan's arms.\n\n\"Please I finks I'se going to Mist'r Burnham's house,\" explained Toady\nLion readily but somewhat unaccurately; \"I'se keepin' off the\ngrass--and I didn't know it was your grass anyway, please, sir.\"\n\nAt the same time Toady Lion saluted because he also was a soldier, and\nMr. Donnan, who in his untempered youth had passed several years in\nthe ranks of Her Majesty's line, mechanically returned the courtesy.\n\n\"Why, little shaver,\" he said not unkindly, \"this isn't the way to\nMr. Burnham's house. There it is over among the trees. But, hello,\ntalk of the--ahem--why, here comes Mr. Burnham himself.\"\n\nToady Lion clapped his hands and ran as fast as he could in the\ndirection of the clergyman. Mr. Burnham was very tall, very soldierly,\nvery stiff, and his well-fitting black coat and corded silk waistcoat\nwere the admiration of the ladies of the neighbourhood. He was never\nseen out of doors without the glossiest of tall hats, and it was\nwhispered that he had his trousers made tight about the calves on\npurpose to look like a dean. It was also understood in well-informed\ncircles that he was writing a book on the eastward position--after\nwhich there would be no such thing as the Low Church. Nevertheless an\nupright, good, and, above all, kindly heart beat under the immaculate\nsilk M. B. waistcoat; also strong capable arms were attached to the\narmholes of the coat which fitted its owner without a wrinkle. Indeed,\nMr. Burnham had a blue jacket of a dark shade in which he had once\nupon a time rowed a famous race. It hung now in a glass cabinet, and\nwas to the clergyman what Sambo Soulis was to General-Field-Marshal\nSmith.\n\nBut as we know, the fear of man dwelt not in Sir Toady Lion, and\ncertainly not fear of his clergyman. He trotted up to him and said, \"I\nwants to go to the castle. You come.\"\n\nNow hitherto Mr. Burnham had always seen Sir Toady Lion as he came,\nwith shining face and liberally plastered hair, from under the tender\nmercies of Janet Sheepshanks--with her parting monition to behave\n(and perhaps something else) still ringing in his ear.\n\nSo that it is no wonder that he did not for the moment recognise in\nthe tear-stained, dust-caked face of the barefooted imp who addressed\nhim so unceremoniously, the features of the son of his most prominent\nparishioner. He gazed down in mildly bewildered surprise, whereupon\nToady Lion took him familiarly by the hand and reiterated his request,\nwith an aplomb which had all the finality of a royal invitation.\n\n\"Take me to the castle on the island. I 'ants to go there!\"\n\n\"And who may you be, little boy?\"\n\n\"Don't 'oo know? 'Oo knows me when 'oo comes to tea at our house!\"\ncried Toady Lion reproachfully. \"I'se Mist'r Smiff's little boy; and I\n'ants to go to the castle.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to go to the castle island?\" asked Mr. Burnham.\n\n\"To find my bruvver Hugh John,\" said Toady Lion instantly.\n\nThe butcher had come up and stood listening silently, after having,\nwith a certain hereditary respect for the cloth, respectfully saluted\nMr. Burnham.\n\n\"This little boy wants to go on the island to find his brother,\" said\nthe clergyman; \"I suppose I may pass through your field with him?\"\n\n\"Certainly! The path is over at the other side of the field. But I\ndon't know but what I'll come along with you. I've lost my son and my\nmessage-boy too. It is possible they may be at the castle.\n\n\"There is some dust being kicked up among the boys. I can't get my\nrascals to attend to business at all this last week or two.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Donnan again caused his cane to whistle through the air in a\nway that turned Toady Lion cold, and made him glad that he was \"Mr.\nSmift's little boy,\" and neither the son nor yet the errand-boy of the\nbutcher of Edam.\n\nPresently the three came to the wooden bridge, and from it they could\nsee the flag flying over the battlements of the castle, and a swarming\npress of black figures swaying this way and that across the bright\ngreen turf in front.\n\n\"Hurrah--yonder they'se fightin'. Come on, Mist'r Burnham, we'll be in\ntime yet!\" shouted Toady Lion. \"They saided that I couldn't come; and\nI've comed!\"\n\nSuddenly a far-off burst of cheering came to them down the wind. Black\ndots swarmed on the perilous battlements of the castle. Other black\ndots were unceremoniously pitched off the lower ramparts into the\nditch below. The red and white flag of jacobin rebellion was pulled\nunder, and a clamorous crowd of disturbed jackdaws rose from the\nturrets and hung squalling and circling over the ancient and lofty\nwalls.\n\nThe conflict had indeed joined in earnest. The embattled foes were in\nthe death grips; and, fearful lest he should arrive too late, Toady\nLion hurried forward his reinforcements, crying, \"Come on both of you!\nCome on, quick!\" Butcher Donnan broke into a run, while Mr. Burnham,\nforgetting all about his silk waistcoat, clapped his tall hat on the\nback of his head and started forward at his best speed, Toady Lion\nhanging manfully on to the long skirts of his coat, as the Highlanders\nhad clung to the cavalry stirrups at Balaclava till they were borne\ninto the very floodtide of battle.\n\nThere were now two trump-cards in the lone hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. THE CROWNING MERCY.\n\n\nWe must now take up the story of the third division of the great\nexpedition, the plan and execution of which so fully reflects the\nmilitary genius of our distinguished hero; for though this part was\ncarried out by Billy Blythe, the credit of the design, as well as the\ndiscovery of the means of carrying it out, were wholly due to General\nNapoleon Smith.\n\nWhen the second boat swept loose and the futile anger of Sir Toady\nLion had ceased to excite the laughter of the crew, the gipsy lads\nsettled down to watching the rush of the Edam Water as it swept them\nalong. They had, to begin with, an easier task than the first boat\nexpedition. No enemy opposed their landing. No dangerous concealed\nstepping-stones had to be negotiated on the route they were to follow.\nLeaving all to the action of the current, they swept through the\nentrance to the wider branch, and presently ranged up alongside the\ndeserted water-front of the ancient defences. They let the castle drop\na little behind, and then rowed up into the eddy made by the corner of\nthe fallen tower, where, on the morning of his deliverance, Hugh John\nhad disturbed the slumbering sheep by so unexpectedly emerging from\nthe secret passage.\n\nBilly stepped on shore to choose a great stone for an anchor, and\npresently pulled the whole expedition alongside the fallen masonry, so\nthat they were able to disembark as upon a pier.\n\nThe Bounding Brothers immediately threw several somersaults just to\nlet off steam, till Billy cuffed them into something like seriousness.\n\n\"Hark to 'em,\" whispered Charlie Lee; \"ain't they pitching it into\nthem slick, over there on the other side. It's surely about our time\nto go at it.\"\n\n\"Just you shut up and wait,\" hissed Billy Blythe under his breath.\n\"That's all your job just now.\"\n\nAnd here, in the safe shelter of the ruined tower, the fourteen\nlistened to the roar of battle surging, now high, now low, in heady\nfluctuations, turbulent bursts, and yet more eloquent silences from\nthe other side of the keep.\n\nThey could distinguish, clear above all, the voice of General Smith,\nencouraging on his men in the purest and most vigorous Saxon.\n\n\"Go at them, boys! They're giving in. Sammy Carter, you sneak, I'll\nsmash you, if you don't charge! Go it, Mike! Wire in, boys! Hike them\nout like Billy-O!\"\n\nAnd the Bounding Brothers, in their itching desire to take part,\nrubbed themselves down as if they had been horses, and softly squared\nup to each other, selecting the tenderest spots and hitting lightly,\nbut with most wondrous accuracy, upon breast or chin.\n\n\"Won't we punch them! Oh no!\" whispered Charlie Lee.\n\nBut from the way that he said it, he hardly seemed to mean what he\nsaid.\n\nJust then came a tremendous and long continued gust of cheering from\nthe defenders of the castle, which meant that they had cleared their\nfront of the assailants. The sound of General Smith's voice waxed\ngradually fainter, as if he were being carried away against his will\nby the tide of retreat. Still at intervals he could be heard,\nencouraging, reproving, exhorting, but without the same glad confident\nring in his tones.\n\nFlags of red and white were waved from the ramparts; pistols (charged\nwith powder only) were fired from embrasures, and the Smoutchies rent\ntheir throats in arrogant jubilation. They thought that the great\nassault had failed.\n\nBut behind them in the turret, all unbeknown, the Bounding Brothers\nsilently patted one another with their knuckles as if desirous of\npractising affectionate greetings for the Smoutchies.\n\nPerhaps they were; and then, again, perhaps they weren't.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now's our time,\" cried Billy Blythe; \"come on, boys. Now for it!\"\n\nAnd with both hands and feet he began to remove certain flag-stones\nand recently heaped up _débris_ from the mouth of a narrow passage,\nthe same by which Hugh John had made his escape. His men stood around\nin astonishment and slowly dawning admiration, as they realised that\ntheir attack was to be a surprise, the most complete and famous in\nhistory, and also one strictly devised and carried out on the best\nmodels. Though the rank and file did not know quite so much about that\nas their Commander-in-Chief, who was sure in his heart that Froissart\nwould have been glad to write about his crowning mercy.\n\nIt is one of the proofs of the genuine nobility of Hugh John's nature,\nand also of his consummate generalship, that he put the carrying out\nof the final _coup_ of his great scheme into other hands, consenting\nhimself to take the hard knocks, to be mauled and defeated, in order\nthat the rout of the enemy might be the more complete.\n\nThe rubbish being at last sufficiently cleared, Billy bent his head\nand dipped down the steps. Charlie Lee followed, and the fourteen were\non their way. Silently and cautiously, as if he had been relieving a\nhen-roost of its superfluous inhabitants, Billy crept along, testing\nthe foothold at every step. He came to the stairway up to the dungeon,\npausing a moment, to listen. There was a great pow-wow overhead. The\nSmoutchies were in the seventh heaven of jubilation over the repulse\nof the enemy.\n\nSuddenly somebody in the passage sneezed.\n\nBilly turned to Charlie Lee. \"If that man does that again, burke him!\"\nhe whispered.\n\nThen with a firm step he mounted the final ascent of the secret stair.\nHis head hit hard against the roof at the top. He had not remembered\nhow Hugh John had told him that the exit was under the lowest part of\nthe bottle dungeon.\n\n\"Bless that roof!\" he muttered piously--more piously, perhaps, than\ncould have been expected of him, considering his upbringing.\n\n\"If Billy Blythe says that again, burke him!\" said a carefully\ndisguised gruff voice from the back--evidently that of the late\nsneezer.\n\n\"Silence--or by the Lord I'll slay you!\" returned Billy, in a hissing\nwhisper.\n\nThere was the silence of the grave behind. Billy Blythe made himself\nmuch respected for the moral rectitude and true worth of his\ncharacter.\n\nOne by one the fourteen stepped clear of the damp stairs, and stood in\nthe wide circuit of the dungeon.\n\nBut the narrow circular exit of the cell was still twelve feet above\nthem. How were they to reach it? The walls were smooth as the inside\nof the bottle from which the prison-house took its name, curving in at\nthe top, without foothold or niches in their smooth surface, so that\nno climber could ascend more than a few feet.\n\nThe Bounding Brothers stepped to the front, and with a hitch of their\nshoulders, stood waiting.\n\n\"Ready!\" said Billy.\n\nIn a moment Charlie Lee was balancing himself on the third storey of\nthe fraternal pyramid. He could just look over the edge of the\nplatform on which the mouth of the dungeon was placed. He ducked down\nsharply.\n\n[\"THE LIVING CHAIN.\"]\n\n\"They are all at their windows, yelling like fun,\" he whispered, with\nthe white, eager look of battle on his face.\n\n\"Up, and at 'em!\" said Billy, as if he had been the Great Duke.\n\nAnd at his word the Bounding Brothers arched their shoulders to\nreceive the weight of the coming climbers. One after another the\nremaining eleven scrambled up, swift and silent as cats; and with\nCharlie Lee at their head, lay prone on the dungeon platform, waiting\nthe word of command. Close as herrings in a barrel they crouched,\ntheir arms outstretched before them, and their chins sunk low on the\nmasonry.\n\nBilly crept along till his head lay over the edge of the bottle\ndungeon. He extended his arms down. The highest Bounding Brother\ngrasped them. His mate at the foot cast loose from the floor and\nswarmed up as on a ladder. The living chain swayed and dangled; but\nthough his wrists ached as if they would part from their sockets,\nBilly never flinched; and finally, with Charlie Lee stretched across\nthe hollow of his knees to keep all taut behind, by mere leverage of\nmuscle he drew up the last brother upon the dungeon platform.\n\nThe fourteen lay looking over upon the unconscious enemy. The level of\nthe floor of the keep was six feet below. The Smoutchies to a man were\nat their posts.\n\nWith a nudge of his elbow Billy intimated that it was not yet time for\nthe final assault. He listened with one ear turned towards the great\nopen gateway, till he heard again the rallying shout of General\nNapoleon Smith.\n\n\"_Now then! Ready all! Double-quick! Char-r-r-ge!_\"\n\nWith a shout the first land division, once repulsed, came the second\ntime at the foe. The Smoutchies crowded to the gateway, deserting\ntheir windows in order to repel the determined assault delivered by\nHugh John and his merry men.\n\n\"Now!\" said Billy Blythe softly, standing up on the dungeon platform.\n\nHe glanced about him. Every Bounding Brother and baresark man of the\ngipsy camp had the same smile on his face, the boxer's smile when he\ngives or takes punishment.\n\nDown leaped Billy Blythe, and straight over the floor of the keep for\nthe great gateway he dashed. One, two--one, two! went his fists. The\nthirteen followed him, and such was the energy of their charge that\nthe Smoutchies, taken completely by surprise, tumbled off their\nplatforms by companies, fell over the broken steps by platoons, and\neven threw themselves in their panic into the arms of Hugh John and\nhis corps, who were coming on at the double in front.\n\nNever was there such a rout known in history. The isolated Smoutchies\nwho had been left in the castle dropped from window and tower at the\nperil of their necks in order that they might have a chance of\nreaching the ground in safety. Then they gathered themselves up and\nfled helter-skelter for the bridge which led towards the town of Edam.\n\nBut what completed their demoralisation was that at this psychological\nmoment the third division under Sir Toady Lion came into action. Mr.\nBurnham, with his coat-tails flying, caught first one and then\nanother, and whelmed them on the turf, while the valiant butcher of\nEdam, having secured his own offspring firmly by the collar, caused\nhis cane to descend upon that hero's back and limbs till the air was\nfilled with the resultant music. And the more loudly Nipper howled,\nthe faster and faster the Smoutchies fled, while the shillelahs of the\ntwo generals, and the fists of the Bounding Brothers, wrought havoc in\ntheir rear. The flight became a rout. The bridge was covered with the\nfugitives.\n\nThe forces of Windy Standard took all the prisoners they wanted, and\nbutcher Donnan took his son, who for many days had reason to remember\nthe circumstance. He was a changed Smoutchy from that day.\n\nThe camp of the enemy, with all his artillery, arms, and military\nstores, fell into the hands of the triumphant besiegers.\n\nAt the intercession of Mr. Burnham the prisoners were conditionally\nreleased, under parole never to fight again in the same war--nor for\nthe future to meddle with the Castle of Windy Standard, the property,\nas Hugh John insisted on putting it, of Mr. Picton Smith, Esq., J. P.\n\nBut Mr. Burnham did what was perhaps more efficacious than any oaths.\nHe went round to all the parents, guardians, teachers, and employers\nof the Smoutchy army. He represented the state of the case to them,\nand the danger of getting into trouble with a man so determined and\npowerful as Mr. Picton Smith.\n\nThe fists of the Bounding Brothers, the sword of General Napoleon, the\nteeth and nails of Sir Toady Lion (who systematically harassed the\nrear of the fleeing enemy) were as nothing to the several interviews\nwhich awaited the unfortunate Smoutchies at their homes and places of\nbusiness or learning that evening, and on the succeeding Monday\nmorning. Their torture of General Smith was amply avenged.\n\nThe victorious army remained in possession of the field, damaged but\nhappy. Their triumph had not been achieved without wounds and bruises\nmanifold. So Mr. Burnham sent for half-a-crown's worth of\nsticking-plaster, and another half-crown's worth of ripe gooseberries.\n\nWhereupon the three divisions with one voice cheered Mr. Burnham, and\nToady Lion put his hand on the sacred silk waistcoat, and said in his\nmost peculiar Toady-leonine grammar, \"'Oo is a bwick. Us likes 'oo!\"\n\nWhich Mr. Burnham felt was, at the very least, equivalent to the\nthanks of Parliament for distinguished service.\n\nIt was a very happy, a very hungry, a very sticky, and a very patchy\narmy which approached the house of Windy Standard at six o'clock that\nnight, and was promptly sent supperless to bed.\n\nHugh John parted with Cissy at the stepping-stones. Her eyes dwelt\nproudly and happily upon him.\n\n\"You fought splendidly,\" she said.\n\n\"We all fought splendidly,\" replied Hugh John, with a nod of approval\nwhich went straight to Cissy's heart, so that the tears sprang into\nher eyes.\n\n\"Oh, you _are_ a nice thing, Hugh John!\" she cried impulsively,\nreaching out her hands to clasp his arm.\n\n\"No, I'm not!\" said Hugh John, startled and apprehensive. Then without\nwaiting for more he turned hastily away.\n\nBut all the same Cissy Carter was very happy that night as she went\nhomeward, and did not speak or even listen when Sammy addressed her\nseveral times by the way upon the dangers of war and the folly of\nlove.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. PRISSY'S COMPROMISE.\n\n\nAfter the turmoil and excitement of the notably adventurous days which\nended with the capture of the castle, the succeeding weeks dragged\nstrangely. The holidays were dwindling as quickly as the last grains\nof sand in an hourglass, and there was an uneasy feeling in the air\nthat the end of old and the beginning of new things were alike at\nhand.\n\nMr. Picton Smith returned from London the day after the great battle.\nThat afternoon he was closeted for a long time with Mr. Burnham, but\nnot even the venturesome Sir Toady Lion on his hands and knees, could\noverhear what the two gentlemen had to say to each other. At all\nevents Mr. Smith did not this time attempt to force any confession\nfrom the active combatants. His failure on a former occasion had been\ncomplete enough, and he had no desire once more to confess himself\nworsted by Hugh John's determination to abjure all that savoured even\nremotely of the \"dasht-mean.\"\n\nBut it is certain that the Smoutchy ringleaders were not further\npunished, and Mr. Smith took no steps to enforce the interdict which\nhe had obtained against trespassers on the castle island.\n\nFor it was about this time that Prissy, having taken a great deal of\ntrouble to understand all the bearings of the case, at last, with a\nbrave heart, went and knocked at her father's study door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said the deep grave voice instantly, sending a thrill\nthrough the closed door, which made her tremble and rather wish that\nshe had not come.\n\n\"Saint Catherine of Siena would not have been afraid,\" she murmured to\nherself, and forthwith opened the door.\n\n\"Well, little girl, what is it? What can I do for you?\" said her\nfather, smiling upon her; for he had heard of her ambassadorial picnic\nto the Smoutchies, and perhaps his daughter's trustful gentleness had\nmade him a little ashamed of his own severity.\n\nPrissy stood nerving herself to speak the words which were in her\nheart. She had seen Peace and kindly Concord bless her mission from\nafar; and now, like Paul before King Agrippa, she would not be\nunfaithful to the heavenly vision.\n\n\"Father,\" she said at last, \"you don't really want to keep people out\nof the castle altogether, do you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, if they behave themselves,\" said her father, \"but the\nmischief is that they don't.\"\n\n\"But suppose, father, that there was some one always there to see that\nthey did behave, would you mind?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" replied her father, \"but you know, Prissy, I can't\nafford to keep a man down on the island to see that sixpenny trippers\ndon't pull down my castle stone by stone, or break their own necks by\nfalling into the dungeon.\"\n\nPrissy thought a little while, and then tried a new tack.\n\n\"Father\"--she went a little nearer to him and stroked the cuff of his\ncoat-sleeve--\"does the land beyond the bridge belong to you?\"\n\nMr. Picton Smith moved away his hand. Her mother used to do just that,\nand somehow the memory hurt. Nevertheless, all unconsciously, the\ntouch of the child's hand softened him.\n\n\"No, Prissy,\" he said wonderingly, \"but what do you know about such\nthings?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" she answered, \"but I am trying to learn. I want\neverybody to love you, and think you as nice as I know you to be.\nDon't you think you could let some one you knew very well live in the\nlittle lodge by the white bridge, and keep out the horrid people, or\nsee that they behaved themselves?\"\n\n\"The town would never agree to that,\" said her father, not seeing\nwhere he was being led.\n\n\"Don't you think the town's people would if you gave them the\nsixpences all for themselves?\"\n\nHer father pushed back his chair in great astonishment and looked at\nPrissy.\n\n\"Little girl,\" he said very gravely, \"who has been putting all this\ninto your head? Has anybody told you to come to me about this?\"\n\nPrissy shook her head quickly, then she looked down as if embarrassed.\n\n\"Well, what is it? Go on!\" said her father, but the words were more\nsoftly spoken than you would think only to see them printed.\n\n\"Nobody told me about anything--I just thought about it all myself,\nfather,\" she answered, taking courage from a certain look in Mr.\nSmith's eyes; \"once I heard you say that the money was what the\ntown's-people cared about. And--and--well, I knew that Jane Housemaid\nwanted to get married to Tom Cannon, and you see they can't, because\nTom has not enough wages to take a house.\"\n\nPrissy was speaking very fast now, rattling out the words so as to be\nfinished before her father could interpose with any grown-up questions\nor objections.\n\n\"And you know I remembered last night when I was lying awake that\nCatherine would have done this----\"\n\n\"What Catherine?\" said her father, who did not always follow his\ndaughter's reasoning.\n\n\"Saint Catherine of Siena, of course,\" said Prissy, for whom there was\nno other of the name; \"so I came to you, and I want you to let Tom\nand Jane have the cottage, and Jane can take up the sixpences in a\nlittle brass plate like the one Mr. Burnham gets from the\nchurchwardens on Sunday. And, oh! but I would just love to help her.\nMay I sometimes, father?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said her father, laughing, \"there is perhaps something in what\nyou say; but I don't think the Provost and Magistrates would ever\nagree. Now run away and play, and I will see what can be done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut all the same Prissy did not go and play, and it was not Mr. Picton\nSmith who saw what could be done. On the afternoon of the same day the\nProvost of the good town of Edam entered the Council Chamber wiping\nhis face and panting vigorously. He was a stout man of much good\nhumour when not crossed in temper, the leading chemist and druggist in\nthe town, and as the proprietor of more houses and less education than\nany man in Edam, of very great influence among the councillors.\n\n\"Well, billies,\" he cried jovially, \"what do you think? There's a lass\nhas keep'd me from the meetin' of this council for a full half-hour.\"\n\n\"A lass!\" answered the senior bailie, still more hilariously, \"that's\nsurely less than proper. I will be compelled to inform Mrs. Lamont of\nthe fact.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was a lassie of twelve or thirteen,\" answered the Provost. \"So\nnone of your insinuations, Bailie Tawse, and I'll thank you. She had a\nmost astonishing tale to tell. It appears she is Picton Smith's\nlassie from Windy Standard; and she says to me, says she, 'Provost, do\nyou want to have the tourist folk that come to Edam admitted to the\ncastle?' says she. 'Of course,' says I, 'that is what the law-plea is\nabout. That dust is no settled yet.' 'Then,' says she, brisk as if she\nwas hiring me at Yedam fair, 'suppose my father was willing to let ye\ncharge a sixpence for admission, would you pay a capable man his wages\nsummer and winter to look after it--a man that my father would approve\nof?' 'Aye,' says I, 'the council would be blythe and proud to do\nthat'--me thinking of my sister's son Peter that was injured by a\nlamp-post falling against him last New Year's night as he was coming\nhame frae the Blue Bell. 'Then,' says she, 'I think it can be managed.\nMy father will put Tom Cannon in the lodge at the white bridge. You\nwill pay him ten shillings in the week for his wife looking after the\ngate and taking the parties over the castle.' 'His wife,' says I; 'Tom\nis no married that ever I heard.' 'No,' says she, 'but he will be very\nquick if he gets the lodge.' Then I thocht that somebody had put her\nup to all this, and I questioned her tightly. But no--certes, she is a\nclever lass. I verily believe if I had said the word she would hae\ncomed along here to the council meeting and faced the pack o' ye. But\nI said to her that she might gang her ways hame, and that I would put\nthe matter before the council mysel'!\"\n\n[\"'THEN,' SAID PRISSY, 'I THINK IT CAN BE MANAGED.'\"]\n\nThe Provost, who had been walking up and down all the time and wiping\nhis brow, finally plumped solidly into his chair. There was a mighty\ndiscussion--in which, as usual, many epithets were bandied about; but\nfinally it was unanimously agreed that, if the offer were put on a\nfirm and legal basis and the interdict withdrawn, the \"Smith's Lassie\"\ncompromise, as it was called for brevity, might be none such a bad\nsolution of the difficulty for all parties.\n\nThus by the wise thought and brave heart of a girl was the great\ncontroversy ended. And now the tourist and holiday-maker, each after\nhis kind, passes his sixpence into the slot of a clicking gate,\ninstead of depositing it in the brazen offertory salver, which had\nbeen the desire of Prissy's heart.\n\n\"For,\" said one of the councillors generously, when the plate was\nproposed, \"how do we know that Mrs. Cannon might not keep every second\nsixpence for herself--or maybe send it up to Mr. Smith? We all know\nthat she was long a servant in his house. No, no, honesty is\nhonesty--but it's better when well looked after. Let us have a patent\n'clicker.' I have used one attached to my till for years, and found it\nof great utility in the bacon-and-ham trade.\"\n\nBut the change made no difference to Hugh John and no difference to\nToady Lion; for they came and went to the castle by the\nstepping-stones, and Cissy Carter took that way too, leaping as nimbly\nas any of them from stone to stone.\n\nOn the Sunday after this was finally arranged, Mr. Burnham gave out\nhis text:--\n\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of\nGod.\"\n\nAnd this is the way he ended his sermon: \"There is one here to-day\nwhom I might without offence or flattery call a true child of God. I\nwill not say who that is; but this I will say, that I, for one, would\nrather be such a peacemaker, and have a right to be called by that\nother name, than be general of the greatest army in the world.\"\n\n\"I think he must mean the Provost--or else my father,\" said Prissy to\nherself, looking reverently up to where, in the front row of the upper\nseats, the local chief magistrate sat, mopping his head with a red\nspotted handkerchief, and sunning himself in the somewhat sultry beams\nof his own greatness.\n\nAs for Hugh John, he declared that for a man who could row in a\ncollege boat, and who worshipped an old blue coat hung up in a glass\ncase, Mr. Burnham said more drivelling things than any man alive or\ndead.\n\nAnd Toady Lion said nothing. He was only wondering all through the\nservice whether he could catch a fly without his father seeing\nhim.--He found that he could not. After this failure he remembered\nthat he had a brandy ball only half sucked in his left trousers'\npocket. He got it out with some difficulty. It had stuck fast to the\nseams, and finally came away somewhat mixed up with twine, sealing\nwax, and a little bit of pitch wrapped in leather. But as soon as he\ngot down to it the brandy ball proved itself thoroughly satisfactory,\nand the various flavours developed in the process of sucking kept\nToady Lion awake till the blessed \"Amen\" released the black-coated\nthrong.\n\nToady Lion's gratitude was almost an entire thanksgiving service of\nitself.\n\nAs he came out through the crowded porch, he put his hand into his\nfather's, and with a portentous yawn piped out in his shrillest voice,\n\"Oh, I is so tired.\"\n\nThe smile which ran round the late worshippers showed that Toady Lion\nhad voiced the sentiments of many of Mr. Burnham's congregation.\n\nAt this moment Mr. Burnham himself came out of the vestry just in time\nto hear the boy's frank expression of opinion.\n\n\"Never mind, Toady Lion,\" he said genially, \"the truth is, I was a\nlittle tired myself to-day. I promise not to keep you quite so long\nnext Sunday morning. You must remind me if I transgress. Nobody will,\nif you don't, Toady Lion.\"\n\n\"Doan know what 'twansguess' is--but shall call out loud if you goes\non too long--telling out sermons and textises and fings.\"\n\nAs they walked along the High Street of Edam, Prissy glanced\nreverently at the Provost.\n\n\"Oh, I wish I could have been a peacemaker too, like him,\" she sighed,\n\"and then Mr. Burnham might have preached about me. Perhaps I will\nwhen I grow up.\"\n\nFor next to Saint Catherine of Siena, the Provost was her ideal of a\npeacemaker.\n\nAs they walked homeward, Mr. Burnham came and touched Prissy on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Money cannot buy love,\" he said, somewhat sententiously, \"but you, my\ndear, win it by loving actions.\"\n\nHe turned to Toady Lion, who was trotting along somewhat sulkily,\nholding his sister's hand, and grumbling because he was not allowed to\nchase butterflies on Sunday.\n\n\"Arthur George,\" said Mr. Burnham, \"if anybody was to give you a piece\nof money and say, 'Will you love me for half-a-crown,' you couldn't do\nit, could you?\"\n\n\"Could just, though!\" contradicted Toady Lion flatly, kicking at the\nstones on the highway.\n\n\"Oh no,\" his instructor suavely explained, \"if it were a bad person\nwho asked you to love him, you wouldn't love him for half-a-crown,\nsurely!\"\n\nToady Lion turned the matter over.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, speaking slowly as if he were thinking hard between\nthe words, \"it might have to be five sillin's if he was _very_ bad!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI. HUGH JOHN'S WAY-GOING.\n\n\nThe secret which had oppressed society after the return of Mr. Picton\nSmith from London, being revealed, was that Hugh John and Sammy Carter\nwere both to go to school. For a while it appeared as if the\nfoundations of the world had been undercut--the famous fellowship of\nnoble knights disbanded, Prissy and Cissy, ministering angel and wild\ntomboy, alike abandoned to the tender mercies of mere governesses.\n\nStrangest of all to Prissy was the indubitable fact that Hugh John\nwanted to go. At the very first mention of school he promptly forgot\nall about his noblest military ambitions, and began oiling his\ncricket bat and kicking his football all over the green. Mr. Burnham\nwas anxious about his pupil's Latin and more than doubtful about his\nVulgar Fractions; but the General himself was chiefly bent on\nimproving his round arm bowling, and getting that break from the left\ndown to a fine point.\n\nEvery member of the household was more or less disturbed by the coming\nexodus--except Sir Toady Lion. On the last fateful morning that\nself-contained youth maundered about as usual among his pets, carrying\nto and fro saucers of milk, dandelion leaves cut small, and other\ndainties--though Hugh John's boxes were standing corded and labelled\nin the hall, though Prissy was crying herself sick on her bed, and\nthough there was even a dry hard lump high up in the great hero's own\nmanly throat.\n\nHis father was giving his parting instructions to his eldest son.\n\n\"Work hard, my boy,\" he said. \"Tell the truth, never tell tales, nor\nyet listen to them. Mind your own business. Don't fight, if you can\nhelp it; but if you have to, be sure you get home with your left\nbefore the other fellow. Practise your bowling, the batting will\npractise itself. And when you play golf, keep your eye on the ball.\"\n\n\"I'll try to play up, father,\" said Hugh John, \"and anyway I won't be\n'dasht-mean'!\"\n\nHis father was satisfied.\n\nThen it was Prissy who came to say good-bye. She had made all sorts\nof good resolutions, but in less than half a minute she was bawling\nundisguisedly on the hero's neck. And as for the hero--well, we will\nnot say what he was doing, something most particularly unheroic at any\nrate.\n\nJanet Sheepshanks hovered in the background, saying all the time, \"For\nshame, Miss Priscilla, think shame o' yoursel'--garring the laddie\ngreet like that when he's gaun awa'!\"\n\nBut even Janet herself was observed to blow her own nose very often,\nand to offer Hugh John the small garden hoe instead of the neatly\nwrapped new silk umbrella she had bought for him out of her own money.\n\nAnd all the while Sir Toady Lion kept on carrying milk and fresh\nlettuce leaves to his stupid lop-eared rabbits. Yet it was by no means\ninsensibility which kept him thus busied. He was only playing his\nusual lone hand.\n\nYet even Toady Lion was not without his own proper sense of the\nimportance of the occasion.\n\n\"There's a funny fing 'at you wants to see at the stile behind the\nstable,\" he remarked casually to Hugh John, as he went past the front\ndoor with an armful of hay for bedding, \"but I promised not to tell\nw'at it is.\"\n\nImmediately Hugh John slunk out, ran off in an entirely different\ndirection, circled about the \"office houses,\" reached the stile behind\nthe stable--and there, with her eyes very big, and her underlip\nquivering strangely, he discovered Cissy Carter.\n\nHe stopped short and looked at her. The pressure of having to say\nfarewell, or of making a stated speech of any kind, weighed heavily\nupon him. The two looked at each other like young wild animals--or as\nif they were children who had never been introduced, which is the same\nthing.\n\n\"Hugh John Picton, you don't care!\" sobbed Cissy at last. \"And I don't\ncare either!\" she added haughtily, commanding herself after a pathetic\nlittle pause.\n\n\"I do, I do,\" answered Hugh John vehemently, \"only every fellow has\nto. Sammy is going too, you know!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't care a button for Sammy!\" was Cissy's most unsisterly\nspeech.\n\nHugh John tried to think of something to say. Cissy was now sobbing\nquietly and persistently, and that did not seem to help him.\n\n\"Say, don't now, Ciss! Stop it, or you'll make me cry too!\"\n\n\"You don't care! You don't love me a bit! You know you don't!\"\n\n\"I do--I do,\" protested the hero, in despair, \"there--there--_now_ you\ncan't say I don't care.\"\n\n\"But you'll be so different when you come back, and you'll have lost\nyour half of the crooked sixpence.\"\n\n\"I won't, for true, Cissy--and I shan't ever look at another girl nor\nplay horses with them even if they ask me ever so.\"\n\n\"You will, I know you will!\"\n\nA rumble of wheels, a shout from the front door--\"Hugh John--wherever\ncan that boy have got to?\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Ciss, I must go. Oh hang it, don't go making a fellow cry.\nWell, I _will_ say it then, 'I love you, Ciss!' There--will that\nsatisfy you?\"\n\n[\"A SLIM BUNDLE OF LIMP WOE.\"]\n\nSomething lit on the end of Cissy's nose, which was very red and wet\nwith the tears that had run down it. There was a clatter of feet, and\nthe Lord of Creation had departed. Cissy sank down behind the stone\nwall, a slim bundle of limp woe, done up in blue serge trimmed with\nscarlet.\n\nThe servants were gathered in the hall. Several of the maids were\nalready wet-eyed, for Hugh John had \"the way with him\" that made all\nwomen want to \"mother\" him. Besides, he had no mother of his own.\n\n\"Good-bye, Master Hugh!\" they said, and sniffed as they said it.\n\n\"Good-bye, everybody,\" cried the hero, \"soon be back again, you know.\"\nHe said this very loudly to show that he did not care. He was going\ndown the steps with Prissy's fingers clutched in his, and every one\nwas smiling. All went merry as a marriage bell--never had been seen so\njovial a way-going.\n\n\"_Ugh--ugh--ugh!_\" somebody in the hall suddenly sobbed out from among\nthe white caps of the maids.\n\n\"Go upstairs instantly, Jane. Don't disgrace yourself!\" cried Janet\nSheepshanks sharply, stamping her foot. For the sound of Jane's sudden\nand shameful collapse sent the other maids' aprons furtively up to\ntheir eyes.\n\nAnd Janet Sheepshanks had no apron. Not that she needed one--of course\nnot.\n\n\"Come on, Hugh John--the time is up!\" said his father from the side of\nthe dog-cart, where (somewhat ostentatiously) he had been refastening\nstraps which Mike had already done to a nicety.\n\nAt this moment Toady Lion passed with half a dozen lettuce leaves. He\nwas no more excited \"than nothing at all,\" as Prissy indignantly said\nafterwards.\n\n\"Good-bye, Toady Lion,\" said Hugh John, \"you can have my other bat\nand the white rat with the pink eyes.\"\n\nToady Lion stood with the lettuce leaves in his arms, looking on in a\nbored sort of way. Prissy could have slapped him if her hands had not\nbeen otherwise employed.\n\nHe did not say a word till his brother was perched up aloft on the\ndog-cart with his cricket bat nursed between his knees and a new\nhard-hat pulled painfully over his eyes. Then at last Toady Lion\nspoke. \"Did 'oo find the funny fing behind the stable, Hugh John?\"\n\nBefore Hugh John had time to reply, the dog-cart drove away amid sharp\nexplosions of grief from the white-capped throng. Jane Housemaid\ndripped sympathy from a first-floor window till the gravel was wet as\nfrom a smart shower. Toady Lion alone stood on the steps with his\nusual expression of bored calmness. Then he turned to Prissy.\n\n\"Why is 'oo so moppy?\"\n\n\"Oh, you go away--you've got no heart!\" said Prissy, and resumed her\nluxury of woe.\n\nIf Toady Lion had been a Gallic boy, we should have said that he\nshrugged his shoulders. At all events, he smiled covertly to the\nlettuces as he moved off in the direction of the rabbit-hutches.\n\n\"It was a _very_ funny fing w'at was behind the stable,\" he said. For\nSir Toady Lion was a humorist. And you can't be a humorist without\nbeing a little hard-hearted. Only the heart of a professional writer\nof pathos can be one degree harder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII. THE GOOD CONDUCT PRIZE.\n\n\nIt was three years after. Sometimes three years makes a considerable\nchange in grown-ups. More often it leaves them pretty much where they\nwere. But with boys and girls the world begins all over again every\ntwo years at most. So the terms went and came, and at each vacation,\ninstead of returning home, Hugh John went to London. For it so\nhappened that the year he had left for school the house of Windy\nStandard was burned down almost to the ground, and Mr. Picton Smith\ntook advantage of the fact to build an entirely new mansion on a\nsomewhat higher site.\n\nThe first house might have been saved had the Bounding Brothers been\nin the neighbourhood, or indeed any active and efficient helpers. But\nthe nearest engine was under the care of the Edam fire brigade, who\nupon hearing of the conflagration, with great enthusiasm ran their\nengine a quarter of a mile out of the town by hand. Then their ardour\nsuddenly giving out, they sat down and had an amicable smoke on the\nroadside till the horse was brought to drag the apparatus the rest of\nthe distance.\n\nBut alas! the animal was too fat to be got between the shafts, so it\nhad to be sent back and a leaner horse forwarded. Meantime the house\nof Windy Standard was blazing merrily, and when the Edam fire company\nfinally arrived, the ashes were still quite hot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo in this way it came about that it was three long years before Hugh\nJohn again saw the hoary battlements of the ancient strength on the\ncastle island which he and his army had attacked so boldly. There were\ngreat changes in the town itself. The railway had come to Edam, and\nnow steamed and snorted under the very walls of the Abbey. Chimneys\nhad multiplied, and the smoke columns were taller and denser. The\nrubicund Provost had gone the way of all the earth, even of all\nprovosts! And the leading bailie, one Donnan, a butcher and army\ncontractor, sat with something less of dignity but equal efficiency in\nhis magisterial chair.\n\nHugh John from the station platform saw something of this with a sick\nheart, but he was sure that out in the pure air and infinite quiet of\nWindy Standard he would find all things the same. But a new and finer\nhouse shone white upon the hill. Gardens flourished on unexpected\nplaces with that appearance of having been recently planted,\nfrequently pulled up by the roots, looked at and put back, which\ndistinguishes all new gardens. Here and there white-painted vineries\nand conservatories winked ostentatiously in the sun.\n\nWhat a time Hugh John had been planning they would have! For months he\nhad thought of nothing but this. Toady Lion and he would do all over\nagain those famous deeds of daring he had done at the castle. Again\nthey would attack the island. Other secret passages would be\ndiscovered. All would be as it had been--only nicer. And Cissy\nCarter--more than everything else he had looked forward to meeting\nCissy. Prissy had seen her often, and even during the last week she\nhad written to Hugh John (Prissy always did like to write letters)\nthat Cissy Carter was just splendid--so much older and _so_ improved.\nCissy was now nearly seventeen, being (as before) a year and three\nmonths older than Hugh John.\n\nNow the distinguished military hero had not been much troubled with\nsentiment during his school terms. Soldiers at the front never are. He\nwas fully occupied in doing his lessons fairly. He got on well with\n\"the fellows.\" He was anxious to keep up his end in the games. But,\nfor all that, during these years he had sacredly kept the half of the\ncrooked sixpence in his box, hidden in the end of a tie which he never\nwore. Now, however, he had looked it out, and by dint of hammering\nhis imagination, he had managed to squeeze out an amount of feeling\nwhich quite astonished himself.\n\nHe would be noble, generous, forbearing. He remembered how faithfully\nCissy had loved him, and how unresponsive he had been in the past. He\nresolved that all would be very different now.\n\nIt was.\n\nThen again he had brought back a record of some distinction from St.\nSalvator's. He had won the school golf championship. He possessed also\na fine bat with an inscription on silver, telling how in the match\nwith St. Aiden's, a rival college of much pretension, he had made 100\nnot out, and taken eight wickets for sixty-nine.\n\nBesides this presentation cricket bat Hugh John had brought home only\none other prize. This was a fitted dressing-bag of beautiful design,\nwith a whole armoury of wonderful silver-plated things inside. It was\nknown as the Good Conduct Prize, and was awarded every year, not by\nthe masters, but by the free votes of all the boys. Prissy was\nenormously proud of this tribute paid to her brother by his\ncompanions. The donor was an old gentleman whose favourite hobby was\nthe promotion of the finer manners of the ancient days, and the terms\nof the remit on which the award must be made were, that it should be\ngiven to the boy who, in the opinion of his fellow-students, was most\ndistinguished for consistent good manners and polite breeding, shown\nboth by his conduct to his superiors in school, and in association\nwith his equals in the playing fields.\n\nAt first Hugh John had taken no interest whatever in this award,\nperhaps from a feeling that his own claims were somewhat slender--or\nthinking that the prize would merely be some \"old book or other.\" But\nit happened that, in order to stimulate the school during the last lax\nand sluggish days of the summer term, the head-master took out the\nfittings of the dressing-bag, and set the stand containing them on his\ndesk in view of all.\n\nThere was a set of razors among them.\n\nInstantly Hugh John's heart yearned with a mighty desire to obtain\nthat prize. How splendid it would be if he could appear at home before\nToady Lion and Cissy Carter with a moustache!\n\nThat night he considered the matter from all points of view--and felt\nhis muscles. In the morning he was down bright and early. He prowled\nabout the purlieus of the playground. At the back of the gymnasium he\nmet Ashwell Major.\n\n\"I say, Ashwell Major,\" he said, \"about that Good Conduct Prize--who\nare you going to vote for?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Ashwell Major, \"I haven't thought much--I suppose\nSammy Carter.\"\n\n\"Oh, humbug!\" cried our hero; \"see here, Sammy will get tons of prizes\nanyway. What does he want with that one too?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"let's give it to little Brown. Butter\nwouldn't melt in his mouth. He's such a cake.\"\n\nHugh John felt that the time for moral suasion had come.\n\n\"Smell that!\" he said, suddenly extending the clenched fist with which\na week before he had made \"bran mash\" of the bully of the school.\n\n[\"SMELL THAT!\"]\n\nReluctantly Ashwell Major's nostrils inhaled the bouquet of Hugh\nJohn's knuckles. Ashwell Major seemed to have a dainty and\ndiscriminating taste in perfumes, for he did not appear to relish this\none.\n\nThen Ashwell Major said that now he was going to vote solidly for\nHugh John Smith. He had come to the conclusion that his manners were\nquite exceptional.\n\nAnd so as the day went on, did the candidate for the fitted\ndressing-bag argue with the other boarders, waylaying them one by one\nas they came out into the playground. The day-boys followed, and each\nenjoyed the privilege of a smell at the fist of power.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I rejoice to announce that the Good Conduct Prize has been awarded by\nthe unanimous vote of all the scholars of Saint Salvator's to Hugh\nJohn Picton Smith of the fifth form. I am the more pleased with this\nresult, that I have never before known such complete and remarkable\nunanimity of choice in the long and distinguished history of this\ninstitution.\"\n\nThese were the memorable words of the headmaster on the great day of\nthe prize-giving. Whereupon our hero, going up to receive his\nwell-earned distinction, blushed modestly and becomingly; and was\ngazed upon with wrapt wonder by the matrons and maids assembled, as\nbeyond controversy the model boy of the school. And such a burst of\ncheering followed him to his seat as had never been heard within the\nwalls of St. Salvator's. For quite casually Hugh John had mentioned\nthat he would be on the look-out for any fellow that was a sneak and\ndidn't cheer like blazes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMORAL.--_There is no moral to this chapter._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. HUGH JOHN'S BLIGHTED HEART.\n\n\nOn the first evening at home Hugh John put on his new straw hat with\nits becoming school ribbon of brown, white and blue, for he did not\nforget that Prissy had described Cissy Carter as \"such a pretty girl.\"\nNow pretty girls are quite nice when they are jolly. What a romp he\nwould have, and even the stile would not be half bad.\n\nHe ran down to the landing-stage, having given his old bat and third\nbest fishing-rod to his brother to occupy his attention. Toady Lion\nwas in an unusually adoring frame of mind, chiefly owing to the new\nbat with the silver inscription which Hugh John had brought home with\nhim. If that were Toady Lion's attitude, how would it be with the\nenthusiastic Cissy Carter? She must be more than sixteen now. He liked\ngrown-up girls, he thought, so long as they were pretty. And Cissy was\npretty, Prissy had distinctly said so.\n\nThe white punt bumped against the landing-stage, but the brown was\ngone. However, he could see it at the other side, swaying against the\nnew pier which Mr. Davenant Carter had built opposite to that of Windy\nStandard. This was another improvement; you used to have to tie the\nboat to a bush of bog-myrtle and jump into wet squashy ground. The\nreturned exile sculled over and tied up the punt to an iron ring.\n\nThen with a high and joyous heart he started over the moor, taking the\nwell-beaten path towards Oaklands.\n\nSuddenly, through the wood as it grew thinner and more birchy, he saw\nthe gleam of a white dress. Two girls were walking--no, not two girls,\nPrissy and a young lady.\n\n\"Oh hang!\" said Hugh John to himself, \"somebody that's stopping with\nthe Carters. She'll go taking up all Cissy's time, and I wanted to see\nsuch a lot of her.\"\n\nThe white dresses and summer hats walked composedly on.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" said Hugh John to himself, \"I'll scoot through the\nwoods and give them a surprise.\"\n\nAnd in five minutes he leaped from a bank into the road immediately\nbefore the girls. Prissy gave a little scream, threw up her hands, and\nthen ran eagerly to him.\n\n\"Why, Hugh John,\" she cried, \"have you really come? How could you\nfrighten us like that, you bad boy!\"\n\nAnd she kissed him--well, just as Prissy always did.\n\nMeanwhile the young lady had turned partly away, and was pulling\ncarelessly at a leaf--as if such proceedings, if not exactly\noffensive, were nevertheless highly uninteresting.\n\n\"Cissy,\" called Priscilla at last, \"won't you come and shake hands\nwith Hugh John.\"\n\nThe girl turned slowly. She was robed in white linen belted with slim\nscarlet. The dress came quite down to the tops of her dainty boots.\nShe held out her hand.\n\n\"How do you do--ah, Mr. Smith?\" she said, with her fingers very much\nextended indeed.\n\nHugh John gasped, and for a long moment found no word to say.\n\n\"Why, Cissy, how you've grown!\" he cried at length. But observing no\ngleam of fellow-feeling in his quondam comrade's eyes, he added\nsomewhat lamely, \"I mean how do you do, Miss--Miss Carter?\"\n\nThere was silence after this, as the three walked on together, Prissy\ntalking valiantly in order to cover the long and distressful silences.\nHugh John's usual bubbling river of speech was frozen upon his lips.\nHe had a thousand things to tell, a thousand thousand to ask. But now\nit did not seem worth while to speak of one. Why should a young lady\nlike this, with tan gloves half-way to her elbows and the shiniest\nshoes, with stockings of black silk striped with red, care to hear\nabout his wonderful bat for the three-figure score at cricket, or the\nfact that he had won the golf medal by doing the round in ninety-five?\nHe had even thought of taking some credit (girls will suck in anything\nyou tell them, you know) for his place in his class, which was\nseventh. But he had intended to suppress the fact that the fifth form\nwas not a very large one at St. Salvator's.\n\nBut now he suddenly became conscious that these trivialities could not\npossibly interest a young lady who talked about the Hunt Ball in some\nsuch fashion as this: \"He is _such_ a nice partner, don't you know! He\ndances--oh, like an angel, and the floor was--well, just perfection!\"\n\nHugh John did not catch the name of this paragon; but he hated the\nbeast anyhow. He did not know that Cissy was only bragging about her\nbat, and cracking up her score at golf.\n\n\"Have you seen 'The White Lady of Avenel' at the Sobriety Theatre, Mr.\nSmith?\" she said, suddenly turning to him.\n\n\"No,\" grunted Hugh John, \"but I've seen the Drury Lane pantomime. It\nwas prime!\"\n\nThe next moment he was sorry he had said it. But the truth slipped out\nbefore he knew. For so little was Hugh John used to the society of\ngrown-up big girls, that he did not know any better than to tell them\nthe truth.\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" commented Cissy Carter condescendingly, \"I used quite to\nlike going to pantomimes when I was a child!\"\n\nA slight and elegant young man, with a curling moustache turned up at\nthe ends, came towards them down the bank. He had grey-and-white\nstriped trousers on, a dark cutaway coat, and a smart straw hat set on\nthe back of his head. He wore gloves and walked with a pretty cane.\nHugh John loathed him on sight.\n\n\"Good-evening, Courtenay,\" said Cissy familiarly, \"this is my friend,\nPrissy Smith, of whom you have heard me speak; and this is her brother\njust home from school!\"\n\n(\"What a beast! I hate him! Calls that a moustache, I daresay. Ha, ha!\nhe should just see Ashwell Major's. And I can lick Ashwell Major with\none hand!\")\n\n\"Aw,\" said the young man with the cane, superciliously stroking his\nmaligned upper lip, \"the preparatory school, I daresay--Lord, was at\none once myself--beastly hole!\"\n\n(\"I don't doubt it, you look it,\" was Hugh John's mental note.) Aloud\nhe said, \"Saint Salvator's is a ripping place. We beat Glen Fetto by\nan innings and ninety-one!\"\n\nMr. Courtenay Carling took no notice. He was talking earnestly and\nconfidentially to his cousin. Hugh John had had enough of this.\n\n\"Come on, Priss,\" he said roughly, \"let's go home.\"\n\nPrissy was nothing loath. She was just aching to get him by himself,\nso that she might begin to burn incense at his manly shrine. She had\nhad stacks of it ready, and the match laid for weeks and weeks.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Cissy frigidly. Hugh John took hold of her dainty\ngloved fingers as gingerly as if each had been a stinging nettle, and\ndropped them as quickly. Mr. Courtenay Carling paused in his\nconversation just long enough to say over his shoulder,\n\"Ah--ta-ta--got lots of pets to run round and see, I s'pose--rabbits\nand guinea-pigs; used to keep 'em myself, you know, beastly things,\nta-ta!\"\n\nAnd with Cissy by his side he moved off, alternately twirling his\nmoustache and glancing approvingly down at her. Cissy on her part\nnever once looked round, but kept poking her parasol into the plants\nat the side of the road, as determinedly as if it had been the old\npike manufactured by the exiled king O'Donowitch. Such treatment could\nnot have been at all good for such a miracle of silk and lace and\ncane; but somehow its owner did not seem to mind.\n\n\"What an awful brute!\" burst out Hugh John, as soon as Prissy and he\nwere clear.\n\n\"Oh, how _can_ you say so!\" said Prissy, much surprised; \"why, every\none thinks him so nice. He has such lots of money, and is going to\nstand for Parliament--that is, if his uncle would only die, or have\nsomething happen to him!\"\n\nHer brother snorted, as if to convey his contempt for \"everybody's\"\nopinion on such a matter; but Prissy was too happy to care for aught\nsave the fact that once more her dear Hugh John was safe at home.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said lovingly, \"I could not sleep last night for\nthinking of your coming! It is so splendid. There's the loveliest lot\nof roses being planted in the new potting house, and I've got a pearl\nnecklace to show you--such a beauty--and----\"\n\nThus she rattled on, joyously ticking off all the things she had to\nshow him. She ran a little ahead to look at him, then ran as quickly\nback to hug him. \"Oh, you dear!\" she exclaimed. And all the while the\nheart of the former valiant soldier sank deep and ever deeper into the\nsplit-new cricketing shoes he had been so proud of when he sallied\nforth to meet Cissy Carter by the stile.\n\n\"Come on,\" she cried presently, picking up her skirts. \"I'm so excited\nI don't know what to do. I can't keep quiet. I believe I can race you\nyet, for all you're so big and have won a silver cricket bat. How I\nshall love to see it! Come on, Hugh John, I'll race you to the gipsy\ncamp for a pound of candy!\"\n\nBut Hugh John did not want to race. He did not want _not_ to race. He\ndid not want ever to do anything any more--only to fade away and die.\nHis heart was cold and dead within him. He felt that he would never\nknow happiness again. But he could not bear to disappoint Prissy the\nfirst night. Besides, he could easily enough beat her--he was sure of\nthat. So he smiled indulgently and nodded acquiescence. He had not\ntold her that he had won the school mile handicap from scratch.\n\nThey started, and Hugh John began to run scientifically, as he had\nbeen taught to do at school, keeping a little behind Prissy, ready to\nspurt at the last and win by a neck. Doubtless this would have\nanswered splendidly, only that Prissy ran so fast. She did not know\nanything about scientific sprinting, but she could run like the wind.\nSo by the time they reached the Partan Burn she had completely\noutclassed Hugh John. With her skirts held high in her hand over she\nflew like a bird; but her brother, jumping the least bit too soon,\nwent splash into the shallows, sending the water ten feet into the\nair.\n\nLike a shot Prissy was back, and reached a hand down to the vanquished\nscientific athlete.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry, Hugh John,\" she said; \"I ought to have told you it\nhad been widened. Don't let's race any more. I think I must have\nstarted too soon, and you'd have beaten me anyway. Here's the gipsy\ncamp.\"\n\nThe world-weary exile looked about him. He had thought that at least\nit might be some manly pleasure to see Billy Blythe once more, and try\na round with the Bounding Brothers. After all, what did it matter\nabout girls? He had a twelve-bladed knife in his pocket which he\nintended for Billy, and he knew a trick of boxing--a feint with the\nright, and then an upward blow with the left, which he knew would\ninterest his friend.\n\nBut the tents were gone. The place where they had stood was green and\nunencumbered. Only an aged crone or two moved slowly about among the\nsmall thatched cottages. To one of these Hugh John addressed himself.\n\n\"Eh, master--Billy Blythe--why, he be 'listed for a sodger--a\ncorp'ral they say he be, and may be sergeant by this time, shouldn't\nwonder. Eh, dearie, and the Boundin' Brothers--oh! ye mean the\njoompin' lads. They're off wi' a circus in Ireland. Nowt left but me\nand my owd mon! Thank ye, sir, you be a gentleman born, as anybody can\nsee without the crossin' o' the hand.\"\n\nSadly Hugh John moved away, a still more blighted being. He left\nPrissy at the white lodge-gate in order that she might go home to meet\nMr. Picton Smith on his return from the county town, where he had been\njudging the horses at an agricultural show. He would take a walk\nthrough the town, he said to himself, and perhaps he might meet some\nof his old enemies. He felt that above everything he would enjoy a\nsharp tussle. After all what save valour was worth living for? Wait\ntill he was a soldier, and came back in uniform with a sword by his\nside and the scar of a wound on his forehead--would Cissy Carter\ndespise him then? He would show her! In the meantime he had learned\ncertain tricks of fence which he would rather like to prove on the\ncountenances of his former foes.\n\nSo with renewed hope in his heart he took his way through the town of\nEdam. The lamps were just being lighted, and Hugh John lounged along\nthrough the early dusk with his hands in his pockets, looking out for\na cause of offence. Presently he came upon a brilliantly lighted\nbuilding, into which young men and women were entering singly and in\npairs.\n\nA hanging lamp shone down upon a noticeboard. He had nothing better\nto do. He stopped and read--\n\n    +--------------------------------------------------------+\n    |            Edam Mutual Improvement Society.            |\n    |                     _SEASON_ 18--                      |\n    |                                                        |\n    |          _Hon.

He only waited outside to hear Mr. N. Donnan's opening\nsentence. It ran thus: \"All ages of the world's history have borne\ntestimony to the fact that peace is preferable to war, right to might,\nand the sweet still voice of Reason to the savage compulsions of\nbrutal Force.\"\n\n\"Oh, hang!\" ejaculated Hugh John, doubling his fist; \"did you ever\nhear such rot? I wish I could jolly well fetch Nipper Donnan one on\nthe nob!\"\n\nAnd he sauntered on till he came to the burying-ground of Edam's\nancient abbey. He wandered aimlessly up the short avenue, stood at the\ngate a while, then kicked it open and went in. He clambered about\namong the graves, stumbling over the grassy mounds till he came to\nthe tombs of his ancestors. At least they were not quite his\nancestors, but the principle was the same. \"There's nothing exclusive\nabout me. I'll adopt them,\" said Hugh John to himself, as many another\ndistinguished person had done before him. They were in fact the tombs\nof the Lorraines, the ancient possessors and original architects of\nthe Castle of Windy Standard, which he had spilt his best blood to\ndefend. Well, it was to attack. But no matter.\n\nHe sat down and looked at the defaced and battered tombs in silence.\nMighty thoughts coursed through his brain. His heart was filled full\nto the brim with the sadness of mortality. Tears of hopeless\nresignation stood in his eyes. It was the end, the solemn end of all.\nSoon he, too, like them, would be lying low and quiet. He began to be\nconscious of a general fatal weakness of the system, a hollowness of\nthe chest (or stomach), which showed that the end was near.\n\nAh, they would be sorry then--_she_ would be sorry! And after morning\nservice in church, they would come and stand by his grave and\nsay--_she_ would say, \"He was young, but he lived nobly, though, alas!\nthere was none to appreciate him. Ah, would that he were again alive!\"\nThen they (she) would weep, yes, weep bitterly, and fling themselves\n(herself) upon the cold, cold ground. But all in vain. He (Hugh John\nPicton Smith, late hero) would lie still in death under that green sod\nand never say a word. No, not even if he could. Like Brer Fox, he\nwould lie low. At this point Hugh John was so moved that he put his\nface down into his hands and sobbed.\n\nA heavy clod of earth whizzed through the air and impacted itself with\na thud upon the mourner's cheek, filling his ear with mud and sand,\nand informing him at the same instant that it carried a stone\nconcealed somewhere about its person.\n\nFor though Nipper Donnan was now Vice-President of a Mutual\nImprovement Association, and at that moment spreading himself in a\nperoration upon the advantages of universal goody-goodiness, he had,\nhappily for society and Hugh John, left exceedingly capable\nsuccessors. The eternal Smoutchy was still very much alive, and still\nan amateur of clods in the town of Edam.\n\nThat sod worked a complete and sudden cure in Hugh John.\n\nHe rose like a shot. Few and short were the prayers he said, but what\nthese petitions lacked in length they made up for in fervency. He\npursued his assailant down the Mill Brae, clamoured after him round\nthe Town-yards, finally cornered him at the Spital Port, punched his\nhead soundly--and felt better.\n\nSo that night the unfortunate young martyr to the flouts and scorns of\nlove, instead of occupying a clay-cold bier with his (adopted)\nancestors in Edam Abbey graveyard, ate an excellent supper in the new\nhouse of Windy Standard, with three helpings of round-of-beef and\nvegetables to match. Then with an empty heart, but a full stomach, he\nbetook himself upstairs to his room, where presently Toady Lion came\nto worship, and Prissy dropped in to see that all was well. She had\nspread prettily worked covers of pink silk over his brushes and combs,\nan arrangement which the hero contemplated with disgust.\n\nHe seized them, gathered them into a knot, and flung them into a\ncorner.\n\n\"Oh, Hugh John!\" cried Prissy, \"how could you? And they took such a\nlong time to do!\"\n\nAnd there were the premonitions of April showers in the sensitive\nbarometer of Priscilla's eyes.\n\nThe brother was touched--as much, that is, as it is in the nature of a\nbrother to be. But in the interests of discipline he could not give\nway too completely.\n\n\"All right, Prissy,\" he said, \"it was no end good of you. But really,\nyou know, a fellow couldn't be expected to put up with these things.\nWhy, they'd stick in your nails and tangle up all your traps so that\nyou'd wish you were dead ten times a day, or else they'd make you say\n'Hang!' and things.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Prissy, with sweetest resignation, \"then I will take\nthem for myself, but I did think you would have liked them!\"\n\n\"Did you, Priss--you are a good sort!\" said Hugh John, patting his\nsister on the cheek.\n\nHis sister felt that after such a demonstration of affection from him\nthere was little left to live for.\n\n\"Good-night, you dear,\" she said; \"I'll wake you in the morning, and\nhave your bath ready for you at eight.\"\n\n\"Good old girl!\" said Hugh John tolerantly, and went to bed, glad that\nhe had been so nice to Prissy about the brush-covers. Such a little\nmakes a girl happy, you know.\n\nPerhaps, all things being considered, it was for the good of our\nhero's soul at this time that Cissy Carter was on hand to take some of\nthe conceit out of him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX. \"GIRLS ARE FUNNY THINGS.\"\n\n\n\"Girls are funny things\" was Hugh John's favourite maxim; and he\nforthwith proceeded to prove that boys are too, by making a point of\nseeing Cissy Carter several times a week during his entire vacation.\nYet he was unhappy as often as he went to Oaklands, and only more\nunhappy when he stayed away. On the whole, Cissy was much less frigid\nthan on that first memorable evening. But she never thawed entirely,\nnor could Hugh John discover the least trace of the hair-brained\nmadcap of ancient days for whom his whole soul longed, in the\ncharmingly attired young lady whose talk and appearance were so much\nbeyond her years. But he shaved three or four times a day with his new\nrazors, sneaking hot water on the sly in order to catch up.\n\nThe last time he could hope to see her before going back to school for\nhis final term, was on the evening of a day when Hugh John had\nsuccessfully captained a team of schoolboys and visitors from the\nsurrounding country-houses against the best eleven which Edam could\nproduce. Cissy Carter had looked on with Mr. Courtenay Carling by her\nside, while Captain (once General Napoleon) Smith made seventy-seven,\nand carried out his still virgin bat amid the cheers of the\nspectators, after having beaten the Edamites by four wickets, and with\nonly six minutes to spare in order to save the draw.\n\n\"Oh, well played!\" cried Mr. Carling patronisingly, as Hugh John came\nup, modestly swinging his bat as if he did as much every day of his\nlife; \"I remember when I was at the 'Varsity----\"\n\nBut Hugh John turned away without waiting to hear what happened to Mr.\nCarling at the 'Varsity which he had honoured with his presence. It\nchanced, however, that at that moment the young gentleman with the\nmoustache saw on the other side of the enclosure a lady of more mature\ncharms than those of his present companion, whose father also had a\ngreat deal of influence--don't you know?--in the county. So in a\nlittle while he excused himself and went over to talk with his new\nfriend in her carriage, afterwards driving home with her to \"a quiet\nfamily dinner.\"\n\nThus Cissy was left to return alone with Sammy, and she gathered up\nher sunshade and gloves with an air of calm and surprising dignity.\nHugh John had meant to bid her an equally cool good night and stroll\noff with the worshipful Toady Lion--who that day had kept wickets\n\"like a jolly little brick\" (as his brother was good enough to say),\nbesides making a useful six before being run out. But somehow, when\nthe hero of the day went to say good-bye, he could not quite carry out\nhis programme, and found himself, against his will, offering in due\nform to \"see Miss Carter home.\"\n\nWhich shows that Hugh John, like his moustache, was growing up very\nrapidly indeed, and learning how to adapt himself to circumstances. He\nwondered what Ashwell Major would say if he knew. It would make him\nsick, Hugh John thought; but after all, what was a fellow to do?\n\nFor the first mile they talked freely about the match, and Cissy\ncomplimented him on his scoring. Then there fell a silence and\nconstraint upon them. They were approaching the historic stile. Hugh\nJohn nerved himself for a daring venture.\n\n\"Do you remember what you once made me say here, Cissy?\" he said. Miss\nCarter turned upon him a perfectly well-bred stare of blankest\nignorance.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I don't remember ever being here with you before.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, no humbug, Cissy--you could remember very well if you\nwanted to,\" said Hugh John roughly. As he would have described it\nhimself, \"his monkey was getting up. Cissy had better look out.\"\n\nHe took from his ticket-pocket the piece of the crooked sixpence,\nwhich he had kept for more than three years in his schoolbox. \"You\ndon't remember that either, I suppose?\" he said with grave irony.\n\nCissy looked at the broken coin calmly--she would have given a great\ndeal if she had had a pincenez or a quizzing-glass to put up at that\npoint. But she did her best without either. Strangely, however, Hugh\nJohn was not even irritated.\n\n\"No,\" she said at last, \"it looks like half of a sixpence which\nsomebody has stepped upon. How quaint! Did you find it, or did some\none give it to you?\"\n\nThey were at the stile now, and Hugh John helped Cissy over. The\ngrown-up swing of her skirt as she tripped down was masterly. It\nlooked so natural. On the other side they both stopped, faced about,\nand set their elbows on the top almost as they had done three or four\nyears ago when--but so much had happened since then.\n\nWith even more serenity Hugh John took a small purse out of his\npocket. It was exceedingly dusty, as well it might be, for he had\npicked it out from underneath the specially constructed grandstand at\nthe cricket ground. He opened it quietly, in spite of the unladylike\nsnatch which Cissy made as soon as she recognised it, dropping her\nyoungladyish hauteur in an instant. Hugh John held the dainty purse\nhigh up out of her reach, and extracted from an inner compartment a\nsmall piece of silver.\n\n[\"IT LOOKS LIKE HALF OF A SIXPENCE WHICH SOMEBODY HAS\nSTEPPED UPON. HOW QUAINT!\"]\n\n\"Give it back to me this moment,\" cried Cissy, who had lost all her\nreserve, and suddenly grown whole years younger. \"I didn't think any\none in the world could be so mean. But I might have known. Do you\nhear--give it back to me, Hugh John.\"\n\nWith the utmost deliberation he snapped the catch and handed her the\npurse. The bit of silver he fitted carefully to the first piece he had\ntaken from his ticket-pocket and held them up. They were the reunited\nhalves of the same crooked sixpence.\n\nThen he looked at Cissy with some of her own former calmness.\n\nHe even offered her the second fragment of silver, whereupon with a\nsudden petulant gesture she struck his hand up, and her own half of\nthe crooked sixpence flew into the air, flashed once in the rays of\nthe setting sun, and fell in the middle of the path.\n\nHugh John stood in front of her a moment silent. Then he spoke.\n\n\"Do you know, Cissy, you are a regular little fraud!\"\n\nAnd with that he suddenly caught the girl in his arms, kissed her\nonce, twice, thrice--and then sprang over the stile, and down towards\nthe river almost as swiftly as Prissy herself. The girl stood a moment\nspeechless with surprise and indignation. Then the tears leaped to her\neyes, and she stamped her foot.\n\n\"Oh, I hate you, I despise you!\" she cried, putting all her injured\npride and anger into the indignant ring of her voice. \"I'll never\nspeak to you again--not as long as I live, Hugh John Smith!\"\n\nAnd she turned away homeward, holding her head very high in the air.\nShe seemed to be biting her lips to keep back the tears which\nthreatened to overflow her cheeks. But just as she was leaving the\nstile, curiously enough she cast sharply over her shoulder and all\nround her the quick shy look of a startled fawn--and stooped to the\npath. The next moment the bit of silver which had sparkled there was\ngone, and Cissy Carter, with eyes still moist, but with the sweetest\nand most wistful smile playing upon her face, was tripping homeward to\nOaklands to the tune of \"The Girl I left behind me,\" which she liked\nto whistle softly when she was sure no one was listening.\n\nAnd at the end of every verse she gave a little skip, as if her heart\nwere light within her.\n\nGirls are funny things.\n\n\n",
