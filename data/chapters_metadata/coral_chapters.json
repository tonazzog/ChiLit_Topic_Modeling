  "content": "The Coral Island\nR. M. Ballantyne\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nI was a boy when I went through the wonderful adventures herein set down.\nWith the memory of my boyish feelings strong upon me, I present my book\nspecially to boys, in the earnest hope that they may derive valuable\ninformation, much pleasure, great profit, and unbounded amusement from\nits pages.\n\nOne word more.  If there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and\nmorose, and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of\nfun, let me seriously advise him to shut my book and put it away.  It is\nnot meant for him.\n\nRALPH ROVER\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe beginning--My early life and character--I thirst for adventure in\nforeign lands and go to sea.\n\nRoving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the joy of my\nheart, the very sunshine of my existence.  In childhood, in boyhood, and\nin man's estate, I have been a rover; not a mere rambler among the woody\nglens and upon the hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic\nrover throughout the length and breadth of the wide wide world.\n\nIt was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night in which I was\nborn on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic Ocean.  My father was a\nsea-captain; my grandfather was a sea-captain; my great-grandfather had\nbeen a marine.  Nobody could tell positively what occupation _his_ father\nhad followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a\nmidshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother's side, had been an admiral\nin the royal navy.  At anyrate we knew that, as far back as our family\ncould be traced, it had been intimately connected with the great watery\nwaste.  Indeed this was the case on both sides of the house; for my\nmother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages, and so\nspent the greater part of her life upon the water.\n\nThus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving disposition.  Soon\nafter I was born, my father, being old, retired from a seafaring life,\npurchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast of\nEngland, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores\nof that sea which had for so many years been his home.  It was not long\nafter this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me.\nFor some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength, so that I\ncame to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by\nwalking on them, and made many attempts to stand up and walk like a man;\nall of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down violently and\nin sudden surprise.  One day I took advantage of my dear mother's absence\nto make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually succeeded in reaching\nthe doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay\nbefore my father's cottage door.  Ah, how vividly I remember the horror\nof my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group\nof cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which she stripped off my\ndripping clothes and washed my dirty little body!  From this time forth\nmy rambles became more frequent, and, as I grew older, more distant,\nuntil at last I had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods\naround our humble dwelling, and did not rest content until my father\nbound me apprentice to a coasting vessel, and let me go to sea.\n\nFor some years I was happy in visiting the sea-ports, and in coasting\nalong the shores of my native land.  My Christian name was Ralph, and my\ncomrades added to this the name of Rover, in consequence of the passion\nwhich I always evinced for travelling.  Rover was not my real name, but\nas I never received any other I came at last to answer to it as naturally\nas to my proper name; and, as it is not a bad one, I see no good reason\nwhy I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph Rover.  My\nshipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and they and I got on very\nwell together.  They did, indeed, very frequently make game of and banter\nme, but not unkindly; and I overheard them sometimes saying that Ralph\nRover was a \"queer, old-fashioned fellow.\"  This, I must confess,\nsurprised me much, and I pondered the saying long, but could come at no\nsatisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my old-fashionedness lay.  It\nis true I was a quiet lad, and seldom spoke except when spoken to.\nMoreover, I never could understand the jokes of my companions even when\nthey were explained to me: which dulness in apprehension occasioned me\nmuch grief; however, I tried to make up for it by smiling and looking\npleased when I observed that they were laughing at some witticism which I\nhad failed to detect.  I was also very fond of inquiring into the nature\nof things and their causes, and often fell into fits of abstraction while\nthus engaged in my mind.  But in all this I saw nothing that did not seem\nto be exceedingly natural, and could by no means understand why my\ncomrades should call me \"an old-fashioned fellow.\"\n\nNow, while engaged in the coasting trade, I fell in with many seamen who\nhad travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; and I freely confess\nthat my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild\nadventures in foreign lands,--the dreadful storms they had weathered, the\nappalling dangers they had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had seen\nboth on the land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and strange\npeople they had visited.  But of all the places of which they told me,\nnone captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the Coral Islands\nof the Southern Seas.  They told me of thousands of beautiful fertile\nislands that had been formed by a small creature called the coral insect,\nwhere summer reigned nearly all the year round,--where the trees were\nladen with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit,--where the climate was\nalmost perpetually delightful,--yet where, strange to say, men were wild,\nbloodthirsty savages, excepting in those favoured isles to which the\ngospel of our Saviour had been conveyed.  These exciting accounts had so\ngreat an effect upon my mind, that, when I reached the age of fifteen, I\nresolved to make a voyage to the South Seas.\n\nI had no little difficulty at first in prevailing on my dear parents to\nlet me go; but when I urged on my father that he would never have become\na great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the truth\nof what I said, and gave his consent.  My dear mother, seeing that my\nfather had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my wishes.\n\"But oh, Ralph,\" she said, on the day I bade her adieu, \"come back soon\nto us, my dear boy, for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may not have\nmany years to live.\"\n\nI will not take up my reader's time with a minute account of all that\noccurred before I took my final leave of my dear parents.  Suffice it to\nsay, that my father placed me under the charge of an old mess-mate of his\nown, a merchant captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South\nSeas in his own ship, the Arrow.  My mother gave me her blessing and a\nsmall Bible; and her last request was, that I would never forget to read\na chapter every day, and say my prayers; which I promised, with tears in\nmy eyes, that I would certainly do.\n\nSoon afterwards I went on board the Arrow, which was a fine large ship,\nand set sail for the islands of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThe departure--The sea--My companions--Some account of the wonderful\nsights we saw on the great deep--A dreadful storm and a frightful wreck.\n\nIt was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvass to\nthe breeze, and sailed for the regions of the south.  Oh, how my heart\nbounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors,\nwhile they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor!  The captain\nshouted--the men ran to obey--the noble ship bent over to the breeze, and\nthe shore gradually faded from my view, while I stood looking on with a\nkind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.\n\nThe first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had yet\nseen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the anchor on\ndeck, and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now bid adieu\nto the land for ever, and would require its services no more.\n\n\"There, lass,\" cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of the\nanchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was\ncompleted--\"there, lass, take a good nap now, for we shan't ask you to\nkiss the mud again for many a long day to come!\"\n\nAnd so it was.  That anchor did not \"kiss the mud\" for many long days\nafterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!\n\nThere were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special\nfavourites.  Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth of\neighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face.  He had had a good\neducation, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but mild\nand quiet in disposition.  Jack was a general favourite, and had a\npeculiar fondness for me.  My other companion was Peterkin Gay.  He was\nlittle, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years\nold.  But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could\nnot have been so much beloved as he was.\n\n\"Hallo! youngster,\" cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder,\nthe day I joined the ship, \"come below and I'll show you your berth.  You\nand I are to be mess-mates, and I think we shall be good friends, for I\nlike the look o' you.\"\n\nJack was right.  He and I and Peterkin afterwards became the best and\nstanchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.\n\nI shall say little about the first part of our voyage.  We had the usual\namount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling\nin the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of\nflying fish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot\nabove the surface.  They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them,\nand one flying-fish in its terror flew over the ship, struck on the\nrigging, and fell upon the deck.  Its wings were just fins elongated, and\nwe found that they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted into\nthe air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea.  Jack and I\nhad it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.\n\nWhen we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of America, the\nweather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell\nstories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape.\n\n\"Cape Horn,\" said one, \"is the most horrible headland I ever doubled.\nI've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most\nblow'd out o' the water.\"\n\n\"An' I've been round it once,\" said another, \"an' that time the sails\nwere split, and the ropes frozen in the blocks, so that they wouldn't\nwork, and we wos all but lost.\"\n\n\"An' I've been round it five times,\" cried a third, \"an' every time wos\nwuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!\"\n\n\"And I've been round it no times at all,\" cried Peterkin, with an\nimpudent wink of his eye, \"an' _that_ time I wos blow'd inside out!\"\n\nNevertheless, we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and,\nin the course of a few weeks afterwards, were sailing gently, before a\nwarm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.  Thus we proceeded on our\nvoyage, sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze, at other times\nfloating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious\ninhabitants of the deep,--all of which, although the sailors thought\nlittle of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.\n\nAt last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific, and I shall never\nforget the delight with which I gazed,--when we chanced to pass one,--at\nthe pure, white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees, which\nlooked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.  And often did we three long\nto be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find perfect\nhappiness there!  Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.\n\nOne night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon\nour ship.  The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts; and\nleft only the foremast standing.  Even this, however, was more than\nenough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.  For five days\nthe tempest raged in all its fury.  Everything was swept off the decks\nexcept one small boat.  The steersman was lashed to the wheel, lest he\nshould be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.  The\ncaptain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far\nout of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the\ndangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.  At day-break\non the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead.  It was an island\nencircled by a reef of coral on which the waves broke in fury.  There was\ncalm water within this reef, but we could only see one narrow opening\ninto it.  For this opening we steered, but, ere we reached it, a\ntremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and\nleft us at the mercy of the winds and waves.\n\n\"It's all over with us now, lads,\" said the captain to the men; \"get the\nboat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than half an\nhour.\"\n\nThe men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little\nhope of so small a boat living in such a sea.\n\n\"Come boys,\" said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as we\nstood on the quarterdeck awaiting our fate;--\"Come boys, we three shall\nstick together.  You see it is impossible that the little boat can reach\nthe shore, crowded with men.  It will be sure to upset, so I mean rather\nto trust myself to a large oar, I see through the telescope that the ship\nwill strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into the quiet\nwater inside; so, if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over\nthe breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.  What say you; will you join\nme?\"\n\nWe gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence,\nalthough I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had\nlittle hope; and, indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed\nthe reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there\nwas but a step between us and death.  My heart sank within me; but at\nthat moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered\nthose words, which were among the last that she said to me--\"Ralph, my\ndearest child, always remember in the hour of danger to look to your Lord\nand Saviour Jesus Christ.  He alone is both able and willing to save your\nbody and your soul.\"  So I felt much comforted when I thought thereon.\n\nThe ship was now very near the rocks.  The men were ready with the boat,\nand the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came\ntowards us.  We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and had\nbarely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like\nthunder.  At the same moment the ship struck, the foremast broke off\nclose to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men along\nwith it.  Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an axe to\ncut it free, but, owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the cordage\nand struck the axe deep into the oar.  Another wave, however, washed it\nclear of the wreck.  We all seized hold of it, and the next instant we\nwere struggling in the wild sea.  The last thing I saw was the boat\nwhirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves.\nThen I became insensible.\n\nOn recovering from my swoon, I found myself lying on a bank of soft\ngrass, under the shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his\nknees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and\nendeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nThe Coral Island--Our first cogitations after landing, and the result of\nthem--We conclude that the island is uninhabited.\n\nThere is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from\na state of insensibility, which is almost indescribable; a sort of\ndreamy, confused consciousness; a half-waking half-sleeping condition,\naccompanied with a feeling of weariness, which, however, is by no means\ndisagreeable.  As I slowly recovered and heard the voice of Peterkin\ninquiring whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept\nmyself, and should be sent to the mast-head for being lazy; but before I\ncould leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away, and I\nfancied that I must have been ill.  Then a balmy breeze fanned my cheek,\nand I thought of home, and the garden at the back of my father's cottage,\nwith its luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honey-suckle that my\ndear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.  But the\nroaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight, and I was\nback again at sea, watching the dolphins and the flying-fish, and reefing\ntopsails off the wild and stormy Cape Horn.  Gradually the roar of the\nsurf became louder and more distinct.  I thought of being wrecked far far\naway from my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet those of my\ncompanion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was gazing into my\nface.\n\n\"Speak to us, my dear Ralph,\" whispered Jack, tenderly, \"are you better\nnow?\"\n\nI smiled and looked up, saying, \"Better; why, what do you mean, Jack?  I'm\nquite well.\"\n\n\"Then what are you shamming for, and frightening us in this way?\" said\nPeterkin, smiling through his tears; for the poor boy had been really\nunder the impression that I was dying.\n\nI now raised myself on my elbow, and putting my hand to my forehead,\nfound that it had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good\ndeal of blood.\n\n\"Come, come, Ralph,\" said Jack, pressing me gently backward, \"lie down,\nmy boy; you're not right yet.  Wet your lips with this water, it's cool\nand clear as crystal.  I got it from a spring close at hand.  There now,\ndon't say a word, hold your tongue,\" said he, seeing me about to speak.\n\"I'll tell you all about it, but you must not utter a syllable till you\nhave rested well.\"\n\n\"Oh! don't stop him from speaking, Jack,\" said Peterkin, who, now that\nhis fears for my safety were removed, busied himself in erecting a\nshelter of broken branches in order to protect me from the wind; which,\nhowever, was almost unnecessary, for the rock beside which I had been\nlaid completely broke the force of the gale.  \"Let him speak, Jack; it's\na comfort to hear that he's alive, after lying there stiff and white and\nsulky for a whole hour, just like an Egyptian mummy.  Never saw such a\nfellow as you are, Ralph; always up to mischief.  You've almost knocked\nout all my teeth and more than half choked me, and now you go shamming\ndead!  It's very wicked of you, indeed it is.\"\n\nWhile Peterkin ran on in this style, my faculties became quite clear\nagain, and I began to understand my position.  \"What do you mean by\nsaying I half choked you, Peterkin?\" said I.\n\n\"What do I mean?  Is English not your mother tongue, or do you want me to\nrepeat it in French, by way of making it clearer?  Don't you remember--\"\n\n\"I remember nothing,\" said I, interrupting him, \"after we were thrown\ninto the sea.\"\n\n{Slowly recovering: p24.jpg}\n\n\"Hush, Peterkin,\" said Jack, \"you're exciting Ralph with your nonsense.\nI'll explain it to you.  You recollect that after the ship struck, we\nthree sprang over the bow into the sea; well, I noticed that the oar\nstruck your head and gave you that cut on the brow, which nearly stunned\nyou, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without knowing\napparently what you were about.  In doing so you pushed the\ntelescope,--which you clung to as if it had been your life,--against\nPeterkin's mouth--\"\n\n\"Pushed it against his mouth!\" interrupted Peterkin, \"say crammed it down\nhis throat.  Why, there's a distinct mark of the brass rim on the back of\nmy gullet at this moment!\"\n\n\"Well, well, be that as it may,\" continued Jack, \"you clung to him,\nRalph, till I feared you really would choke him; but I saw that he had a\ngood hold of the oar, so I exerted myself to the utmost to push you\ntowards the shore, which we luckily reached without much trouble, for the\nwater inside the reef is quite calm.\"\n\n\"But the captain and crew, what of them?\" I inquired anxiously.\n\nJack shook his head.\n\n\"Are they lost?\"\n\n\"No, they are not lost, I hope, but I fear there is not much chance of\ntheir being saved.  The ship struck at the very tail of the island on\nwhich we are cast.  When the boat was tossed into the sea it fortunately\ndid not upset, although it shipped a good deal of water, and all the men\nmanaged to scramble into it; but before they could get the oars out the\ngale carried them past the point and away to leeward of the island.  After\nwe landed I saw them endeavouring to pull towards us, but as they had\nonly one pair of oars out of the eight that belong to the boat, and as\nthe wind was blowing right in their teeth, they gradually lost ground.\nThen I saw them put about and hoist some sort of sail,--a blanket, I\nfancy, for it was too small for the boat,--and in half an hour they were\nout of sight.\"\n\n\"Poor fellows,\" I murmured sorrowfully.\n\n\"But the more I think about it, I've better hope of them,\" continued\nJack, in a more cheerful tone.  \"You see, Ralph, I've read a great deal\nabout these South Sea Islands, and I know that in many places they are\nscattered about in thousands over the sea, so they're almost sure to fall\nin with one of them before long.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Peterkin, earnestly.  \"But what has become of\nthe wreck, Jack?  I saw you clambering up the rocks there while I was\nwatching Ralph.  Did you say she had gone to pieces?\"\n\n\"No, she has not gone to pieces, but she has gone to the bottom,\" replied\nJack.  \"As I said before, she struck on the tail of the island and stove\nin her bow, but the next breaker swung her clear, and she floated away to\nleeward.  The poor fellows in the boat made a hard struggle to reach her,\nbut long before they came near her she filled and went down.  It was\nafter she foundered that I saw them trying to pull to the island.\"\n\nThere wan a long silence after Jack ceased speaking, and I have no doubt\nthat each was revolving in his mind our extraordinary position.  For my\npart I cannot say that my reflections were very agreeable.  I knew that\nwe were on an island, for Jack had said so, but whether it was inhabited\nor not I did not know.  If it should be inhabited, I felt certain, from\nall I had heard of South Sea Islanders, that we should be roasted alive\nand eaten.  If it should turn out to be uninhabited, I fancied that we\nshould be starved to death.  \"Oh!\" thought I, \"if the ship had only stuck\non the rocks we might have done pretty well, for we could have obtained\nprovisions from her, and tools to enable us to build a shelter, but\nnow--alas! alas! we are lost!\"  These last words I uttered aloud in my\ndistress.\n\n\"Lost!  Ralph?\" exclaimed Jack, while a smile overspread his hearty\ncountenance. \"Saved, you should have said.  Your cogitations seem to have\ntaken a wrong road, and led you to a wrong conclusion.\"\n\n\"Do you know what conclusion _I_ have come to?\" said Peterkin.  \"I have\nmade up my mind that it's capital,--first rate,--the best thing that ever\nhappened to us, and the most splendid prospect that ever lay before three\njolly young tars.  We've got an island all to ourselves.  We'll take\npossession in the name of the king; we'll go and enter the service of its\nblack inhabitants.  Of course we'll rise, naturally, to the top of\naffairs.  White men always do in savage countries.  You shall be king,\nJack; Ralph, prime minister, and I shall be--\"\n\n\"The court jester,\" interrupted Jack.\n\n\"No,\" retorted Peterkin, \"I'll have no title at all.  I shall merely\naccept a highly responsible situation under government, for you see,\nJack, I'm fond of having an enormous salary and nothing to do.\"\n\n\"But suppose there are no natives?\"\n\n\"Then we'll build a charming villa, and plant a lovely garden round it,\nstuck all full of the most splendiferous tropical flowers, and we'll farm\nthe land, plant, sow, reap, eat, sleep, and be merry.\"\n\n\"But to be serious,\" said Jack, assuming a grave expression of\ncountenance, which I observed always had the effect of checking\nPeterkin's disposition to make fun of everything, \"we are really in\nrather an uncomfortable position.  If this is a desert island, we shall\nhave to live very much like the wild beasts, for we have not a tool of\nany kind, not even a knife.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have _that_,\" said Peterkin, fumbling in his trousers pocket,\nfrom which he drew forth a small penknife with only one blade, and that\nwas broken.\n\n\"Well, that's better than nothing; but come,\" said Jack, rising, \"we are\nwasting our time in _talking_ instead of _doing_.  You seem well enough\nto walk now, Ralph, let us see what we have got in our pockets, and then\nlet us climb some hill and ascertain what sort of island we have been\ncast upon, for, whether good or bad, it seems likely to be our home for\nsome time to come.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nWe examine into our personal property, and make a happy discovery--Our\nisland described--Jack proves himself to be learned and sagacious above\nhis fellows--Curious discoveries--Natural lemonade!\n\nWe now seated ourselves upon a rock and began to examine into our\npersonal property.  When we reached the shore, after being wrecked, my\ncompanions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in the\nsun to dry, for, although the gale was raging fiercely, there was not a\nsingle cloud in the bright sky.  They had also stripped off most part of\nmy wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks.  Having resumed our\ngarments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, and laid\ntheir contents out on a flat stone before us; and, now that our minds\nwere fully alive to our condition, it was with no little anxiety that we\nturned our several pockets inside out, in order that nothing might escape\nus.  When all was collected together we found that our worldly goods\nconsisted of the following articles:--\n\nFirst, A small penknife with a single blade broken off about the middle\nand very rusty, besides having two or three notches on its edge.\n(Peterkin said of this, with his usual pleasantry, that it would do for a\nsaw as well as a knife, which was a great advantage.)  Second, An old\nGerman-silver pencil-case without any lead in it.  Third, A piece of whip-\ncord about six yards long.  Fourth, A sailmaker's needle of a small size.\nFifth, A ship's telescope, which I happened to have in my hand at the\ntime the ship struck, and which I had clung to firmly all the time I was\nin the water.  Indeed it was with difficulty that Jack got it out of my\ngrasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.  I cannot understand why\nI kept such a firm hold of this telescope.  They say that a drowning man\nwill clutch at a straw.  Perhaps it may have been some such feeling in\nme, for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were\nwrecked.  However, we felt some pleasure in having it with us now,\nalthough we did not see that it could be of much use to us, as the glass\nat the small end was broken to pieces.  Our sixth article was a brass\nring which Jack always wore on his little finger.  I never understood why\nhe wore it, for Jack was not vain of his appearance, and did not seem to\ncare for ornaments of any kind.  Peterkin said \"it was in memory of the\ngirl he left behind him!\"  But as he never spoke of this girl to either\nof us, I am inclined to think that Peterkin was either jesting or\nmistaken.  In addition to these articles we had a little bit of tinder,\nand the clothes on our backs.  These last were as follows:--\n\nEach of us had on a pair of stout canvass trousers, and a pair of\nsailors' thick shoes.  Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and\na red Kilmarnock bonnet or night-cap, besides a pair of worsted socks,\nand a cotton pocket-handkerchief, with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson\nprinted on it, and a union Jack in the middle.  Peterkin had on a striped\nflannel shirt,--which he wore outside his trousers, and belted round his\nwaist, after the manner of a tunic,--and a round black straw hat.  He had\nno jacket, having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea;\nbut this was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island proved\nto be extremely mild; so much so, indeed, that Jack and I often preferred\nto go about without our jackets.  Peterkin had also a pair of white\ncotton socks, and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it.  My\nown costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black\ncap, and a pair of worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvass trousers\nalready mentioned.  This was all we had, and besides these things we had\nnothing else; but, when we thought of the danger from which we had\nescaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck on\nthe reef during the night, we felt very thankful that we were possessed\nof so much, although, I must confess, we sometimes wished that we had had\na little more.\n\nWhile we were examining these things, and talking about them, Jack\nsuddenly started and exclaimed--\n\n\"The oar! we have forgotten the oar.\"\n\n\"What good will that do us?\" said Peterkin; \"there's wood enough on the\nisland to make a thousand oars.\"\n\n\"Ay, lad,\" replied Jack, \"but there's a bit of hoop iron at the end of\nit, and that may be of much use to us.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said I, \"let us go fetch it;\" and with that we all three\nrose and hastened down to the beach.  I still felt a little weak from\nloss of blood, so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but\nJack perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good nature, turned\nback to help me.  This was now the first time that I had looked well\nabout me since landing, as the spot where I had been laid was covered\nwith thick bushes which almost hid the country from our view.  As we now\nemerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together, I cast\nmy eyes about, and, truly, my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose\nat the beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.  The gale had\nsuddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed our\nship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after accomplishing that.\nThe island on which we stood was hilly, and covered almost everywhere\nwith the most beautiful and richly coloured trees, bushes, and shrubs,\nnone of which I knew the names of at that time, except, indeed, the cocoa-\nnut palms, which I recognised at once from the many pictures that I had\nseen of them before I left home.  A sandy beach of dazzling whiteness\nlined this bright green shore, and upon it there fell a gentle ripple of\nthe sea.  This last astonished me much, for I recollected that at home\nthe sea used to fall in huge billows on the shore long after a storm had\nsubsided.  But on casting my glance out to sea the cause became apparent.\nAbout a mile distant from the shore I saw the great billows of the ocean\nrolling like a green wall, and falling with a long, loud roar, upon a low\ncoral reef, where they were dashed into white foam and flung up in clouds\nof spray.  This spray sometimes flew exceedingly high, and, every here\nand there, a beautiful rainbow was formed for a moment among the falling\ndrops.  We afterwards found that this coral reef extended quite round the\nisland, and formed a natural breakwater to it.  Beyond this the sea rose\nand tossed violently from the effects of the storm; but between the reef\nand the shore it was as calm and as smooth as a pond.\n\nMy heart was filled with more delight than I can express at sight of so\nmany glorious objects, and my thoughts turned suddenly to the\ncontemplation of the Creator of them all.  I mention this the more\ngladly, because at that time, I am ashamed to say, I very seldom thought\nof my Creator, although I was constantly surrounded by the most beautiful\nand wonderful of His works.  I observed from the expression of my\ncompanion's countenance that he too derived much joy from the splendid\nscenery, which was all the more agreeable to us after our long voyage on\nthe salt sea.  There, the breeze was fresh and cold, but here it was\ndelightfully mild; and, when a puff blew off the land, it came laden with\nthe most exquisite perfume that can be imagined.  While we thus gazed, we\nwere startled by a loud \"Huzza!\" from Peterkin, and, on looking towards\nthe edge of the sea, we saw him capering and jumping about like a monkey,\nand ever and anon tugging with all his might at something that lay upon\nthe shore.\n\n\"What an odd fellow he is, to be sure,\" said Jack, taking me by the arm\nand hurrying forward; \"come, let us hasten to see what it is.\"\n\n\"Here it is, boys, hurrah! come along.  Just what we want,\" cried\nPeterkin, as we drew near, still tugging with all his power.  \"First\nrate; just the very ticket!\"\n\nI need scarcely say to my readers that my companion Peterkin was in the\nhabit of using very remarkable and peculiar phrases.  And I am free to\nconfess that I did not well understand the meaning of some of them,--such,\nfor instance, as \"the very ticket;\" but I think it my duty to recount\neverything relating to my adventures with a strict regard to truthfulness\nin as far as my memory serves me; so I write, as nearly as possible, the\nexact words that my companions spoke.  I often asked Peterkin to explain\nwhat he meant by \"ticket,\" but he always answered me by going into fits\nof laughter.  However, by observing the occasions on which he used it, I\ncame to understand that it meant to show that something was remarkably\ngood, or fortunate.\n\nOn coming up we found that Peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the\naxe out of the oar, into which, it will be remembered, Jack struck it\nwhile endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become\nentangled at the bow of the ship.  Fortunately for us the axe had\nremained fast in the oar, and even now, all Peterkin's strength could not\ndraw it out of the cut.\n\n\"Ah! that is capital indeed,\" cried Jack, at the same time giving the axe\na wrench that plucked it out of the tough wood.  \"How fortunate this is!\nIt will be of more value to us than a hundred knives, and the edge is\nquite new and sharp.\"\n\n\"I'll answer for the toughness of the handle at any rate,\" cried\nPeterkin; \"my arms are nearly pulled out of the sockets.  But see here,\nour luck is great.  There is iron on the blade.\"  He pointed to a piece\nof hoop iron, as he spoke, which had been nailed round the blade of the\noar to prevent it from splitting.\n\nThis also was a fortunate discovery.  Jack went down on his knees, and\nwith the edge of the axe began carefully to force out the nails.  But as\nthey were firmly fixed in, and the operation blunted our axe, we carried\nthe oar up with us to the place where we had left the rest of our things,\nintending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more convenient time.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, after we had laid it on the stone which contained\nour little all, \"I propose that we should go to the tail of the island,\nwhere the ship struck, which is only a quarter of a mile off, and see if\nanything else has been thrown ashore.  I don't expect anything, but it is\nwell to see.  When we get back here it will be time to have our supper\nand prepare our beds.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" cried Peterkin and I together, as, indeed, we would have agreed\nto any proposal that Jack made; for, besides his being older and much\nstronger and taller than either of us, he was a very clever fellow, and I\nthink would have induced people much older than himself to choose him for\ntheir leader, especially if they required to be led on a bold enterprise.\n\nNow, as we hastened along the white beach, which shone so brightly in the\nrays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare, it\nsuddenly came into Peterkin's head that we had nothing to eat except the\nwild berries which grew in profusion at our feet.\n\n\"What shall we do, Jack?\" said he, with a rueful look; \"perhaps they may\nbe poisonous!\"\n\n\"No fear,\" replied Jack, confidently; \"I have observed that a few of them\nare not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native\nhills.  Besides, I saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few\nminutes ago, and what won't kill the birds won't kill us.  But look up\nthere, Peterkin,\" continued Jack, pointing to the branched head of a\ncocoa-nut palm.  \"There are nuts for us in all stages.\"\n\n\"So there are!\" cried Peterkin, who being of a very unobservant nature\nhad been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high\nabove his head as the fruit of a palm tree.  But, whatever faults my\nyoung comrade had, he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal\nspirits.  Indeed, the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he\nbounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel, and, in a few\nminutes, returned with three nuts, each as large as a man's fist.\n\n\"You had better keep them till we return,\" raid Jack.  \"Let us finish our\nwork before eating.\"\n\n\"So be it, captain, go ahead,\" cried Peterkin, thrusting the nuts into\nhis trousers pocket.  \"In fact I don't want to eat just now, but I would\ngive a good deal for a drink.  Oh that I could find a spring! but I don't\nsee the smallest sign of one hereabouts.  I say, Jack, how does it happen\nthat you seem to be up to everything?  You have told us the names of half-\na-dozen trees already, and yet you say that you were never in the South\nSeas before.\"\n\n\"I'm not up to _everything_, Peterkin, as you'll find out ere long,\"\nreplied Jack, with a smile; \"but I have been a great reader of books of\ntravel and adventure all my life, and that has put me up to a good many\nthings that you are, perhaps, not acquainted with.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jack, that's all humbug.  If you begin to lay everything to the\ncredit of books, I'll quite lose my opinion of you,\" cried Peterkin, with\na look of contempt.  \"I've seen a lot o' fellows that were _always_\nporing over books, and when they came to try to _do_ anything, they were\nno better than baboons!\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" retorted Jack; \"and I have seen a lot of fellows\nwho never looked into books at all, who knew nothing about anything\nexcept the things they had actually seen, and very little they knew even\nabout these.  Indeed, some were so ignorant that they did not know that\ncocoa-nuts grew on cocoa-nut trees!\"\n\nI could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke, for there was much\ntruth in it, as to Peterkin's ignorance.\n\n\"Humph! maybe you're right,\" answered Peterkin; \"but I would not give\n_tuppence_ for a man of books, if he had nothing else in him.\"\n\n\"Neither would I,\" said Jack; \"but that's no reason why you should run\nbooks down, or think less of me for having read them.  Suppose, now,\nPeterkin, that you wanted to build a ship, and I were to give you a long\nand particular account of the way to do it, would not that be very\nuseful?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" said Peterkin, laughing.\n\n\"And suppose I were to write the account in a letter instead of telling\nyou in words, would that be less useful?\"\n\n\"Well--no, perhaps not.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose I were to print it, and send it to you in the form of a\nbook, would it not be as good and useful as ever?\"\n\n\"Oh, bother! Jack, you're a philosopher, and that's worse than anything!\"\ncried Peterkin, with a look of pretended horror.\n\n\"Very well, Peterkin, we shall see,\" returned Jack, halting under the\nshade of a cocoa-nut tree.  \"You said you were thirsty just a minute ago;\nnow, jump up that tree and bring down a nut,--not a ripe one, bring a\ngreen, unripe one.\"\n\nPeterkin looked surprised, but, seeing that Jack was in earnest, he\nobeyed.\n\n\"Now, cut a hole in it with your penknife, and clap it to your mouth, old\nfellow,\" said Jack.\n\nPeterkin did as he was directed, and we both burst into uncontrollable\nlaughter at the changes that instantly passed over his expressive\ncountenance.  No sooner had he put the nut to his mouth, and thrown back\nhis head in order to catch what came out of it, than his eyes opened to\ntwice their ordinary size with astonishment, while his throat moved\nvigorously in the act of swallowing.  Then a smile and look of intense\ndelight overspread his face, except, indeed, the mouth, which, being\nfirmly fixed to the hole in the nut, could not take part in the\nexpression; but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at us\nexcessively with his right eye.  At length he stopped, and, drawing a\nlong breath, exclaimed--\n\n\"Nectar! perfect nectar!  I say, Jack, you're a Briton--the best fellow I\never met in my life.  Only taste that!\" said he, turning to me and\nholding the nut to my mouth.  I immediately drank, and certainly I was\nmuch surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my\nthroat.  It was extremely cool, and had a sweet taste, mingled with acid;\nin fact, it was the likest thing to lemonade I ever tasted, and was most\ngrateful and refreshing.  I handed the nut to Jack, who, after tasting\nit, said, \"Now, Peterkin, you unbeliever, I never saw or tasted a cocoa\nnut in my life before, except those sold in shops at home; but I once\nread that the green nuts contain that stuff, and you see it is true!\"\n\n\"And pray,\" asked Peterkin, \"what sort of 'stuff' does the ripe nut\ncontain?\"\n\n\"A hollow kernel,\" answered Jack, \"with a liquid like milk in it; but it\ndoes not satisfy thirst so well as hunger.  It is very wholesome food I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Meat and drink on the same tree!\" cried Peterkin; \"washing in the sea,\nlodging on the ground,--and all for nothing!  My dear boys, we're set up\nfor life; it must be the ancient Paradise,--hurrah!\" and Peterkin tossed\nhis straw hat in the air, and ran along the beach hallooing like a madman\nwith delight.\n\nWe afterwards found, however, that these lovely islands were very unlike\nParadise in many things.  But more of this in its proper place.\n\nWe had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck, but\ndid not find a single article, although we searched carefully among the\ncoral rocks, which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the\nreef that encircled the island.  Just as we were about to return,\nhowever, we saw something black floating in a little cove that had\nescaped our observation.  Running forward, we drew it from the water, and\nfound it to be a long thick leather boot, such as fishermen at home wear;\nand a few paces farther on we picked up its fellow.  We at once\nrecognised these as having belonged to our captain, for he had worn them\nduring the whole of the storm, in order to guard his legs from the waves\nand spray that constantly washed over our decks.  My first thought on\nseeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned; but Jack soon put\nmy mind more at rest on that point, by saying that if the captain had\nbeen drowned with the boots on, he would certainly have been washed\nashore along with them, and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked\nthem off while in the sea, that he might swim more easily.\n\nPeterkin immediately put them on, but they were so large that, as Jack\nsaid, they would have done for boots, trousers, and vest too.  I also\ntried them, but, although I was long enough in the legs for them, they\nwere much too large in the feet for me; so we handed them to Jack, who\nwas anxious to make me keep them, but as they fitted his large limbs and\nfeet as if they had been made for him, I would not hear of it, so he\nconsented at last to use them.  I may remark, however, that Jack did not\nuse them often, as they were extremely heavy.\n\nIt was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our encampment; so we\nput off our visit to the top of a hill till next day, and employed the\nlight that yet remained to us in cutting down a quantity of boughs and\nthe broad leaves of a tree, of which none of us knew the name.  With\nthese we erected a sort of rustic bower, in which we meant to pass the\nnight.  There was no absolute necessity for this, because the air of our\nisland was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite well\nwithout any shelter; but we were so little used to sleeping in the open\nair, that we did not quite relish the idea of lying down without any\ncovering over us: besides, our bower would shelter us from the night dews\nor rain, if any should happen to fall.  Having strewed the floor with\nleaves and dry grass, we bethought ourselves of supper.\n\nBut it now occurred to us, for the first time, that we had no means of\nmaking a fire.\n\n\"Now, there's a fix!--what shall we do?\" said Peterkin, while we both\nturned our eyes to Jack, to whom we always looked in our difficulties.\nJack seemed not a little perplexed.\n\n\"There are flints enough, no doubt, on the beach,\" said he, \"but they are\nof no use at all without a steel.  However, we must try.\"  So saying, he\nwent to the beach, and soon returned with two flints.  On one of these he\nplaced the tinder, and endeavoured to ignite it; but it was with great\ndifficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the flints, and the\ntinder, being a bad, hard piece, would not catch.  He then tried the bit\nof hoop iron, which would not strike fire at all; and after that the back\nof the axe, with no better success.  During all these trials Peterkin sat\nwith his hands in his pockets, gazing with a most melancholy visage at\nour comrade, his face growing longer and more miserable at each\nsuccessive failure.\n\n\"Oh dear!\" he sighed, \"I would not care a button for the cooking of our\nvictuals,--perhaps they don't need it,--but it's so dismal to eat one's\nsupper in the dark, and we have had such a capital day, that it's a pity\nto finish off in this glum style.  Oh, I have it!\" he cried, starting up;\n\"the spy-glass,--the big glass at the end is a burning-glass!\"\n\n\"You forget that we have no sun,\" said I.\n\nPeterkin was silent.  In his sudden recollection of the telescope he had\nquite overlooked the absence of the sun.\n\n\"Ah, boys, I've got it now!\" exclaimed Jack, rising and cutting a branch\nfrom a neighbouring bush, which be stripped of its leaves.  \"I recollect\nseeing this done once at home.  Hand me the bit of whip-cord.\"  With the\ncord and branch Jack soon formed a bow.  Then he cut a piece, about three\ninches long, off the end of a dead branch, which he pointed at the two\nends.  Round this he passed the cord of the bow, and placed one end\nagainst his chest, which was protected from its point by a chip of wood;\nthe other point he placed against the bit of tinder, and then began to\nsaw vigorously with the bow, just as a blacksmith does with his drill\nwhile boring a hole in a piece of iron.  In a few seconds the tinder\nbegan to smoke; in less than a minute it caught fire; and in less than a\nquarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoa nuts\nround a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep, while the smoke,\nflames, and sparks, flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging\npalm trees, and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower.\n\nThat night the starry sky looked down through the gently rustling trees\nupon our slumbers, and the distant roaring of the surf upon the coral\nreef was our lullaby.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nMorning, and cogitations connected therewith--We luxuriate in the sea,\ntry our diving powers, and make enchanting excursions among the coral\ngroves at the bottom of the ocean--The wonders of the deep enlarged upon.\n\nWhat a joyful thing it is to awaken, on a fresh glorious morning, and\nfind the rising sun staring into your face with dazzling brilliancy!--to\nsee the birds twittering in the bushes, and to hear the murmuring of a\nrill, or the soft hissing ripples as they fall upon the sea-shore!  At\nany time and in any place such sights and sounds are most charming, but\nmore especially are they so when one awakens to them, for the fist time,\nin a novel and romantic situation, with the soft sweet air of a tropical\nclimate mingling with the fresh smell of the sea, and stirring the\nstrange leaves that flutter overhead and around one, or ruffling the\nplumage of the stranger birds that fly inquiringly around, as if to\ndemand what business we have to intrude uninvited on their domains.  When\nI awoke on the morning after the shipwreck, I found myself in this most\ndelightful condition; and, as I lay on my back upon my bed of leaves,\ngazing up through the branches of the cocoa-nut trees into the clear blue\nsky, and watched the few fleecy clouds that passed slowly across it, my\nheart expanded more and more with an exulting gladness, the like of which\nI had never felt before.  While I meditated, my thoughts again turned to\nthe great and kind Creator of this beautiful world, as they had done on\nthe previous day, when I first beheld the sea and the coral reef, with\nthe mighty waves dashing over it into the calm waters of the lagoon.\n\nWhile thus meditating, I naturally bethought me of my Bible, for I had\nfaithfully kept the promise, which I gave at parting to my beloved\nmother, that I would read it every morning; and it was with a feeling of\ndismay that I remembered I had left it in the ship.  I was much troubled\nabout this.  However, I consoled myself with reflecting that I could keep\nthe second part of my promise to her, namely, that I should never omit to\nsay my prayers.  So I rose quietly, lest I should disturb my companions,\nwho were still asleep, and stepped aside into the bushes for this\npurpose.\n\nOn my return I found them still slumbering, so I again lay down to think\nover our situation.  Just at that moment I was attracted by the sight of\na very small parrot, which Jack afterwards told me was called a paroquet.\nIt was seated on a twig that overhung Peterkin's head, and I was speedily\nlost in admiration of its bright green plumage, which was mingled with\nother gay colours.  While I looked I observed that the bird turned its\nhead slowly from side to side and looked downwards, fist with the one\neye, and then with the other.  On glancing downwards I observed that\nPeterkin's mouth was wide open, and that this remarkable bird was looking\ninto it.  Peterkin used to say that I had not an atom of fun in my\ncomposition, and that I never could understand a joke.  In regard to the\nlatter, perhaps he was right; yet I think that, when they were explained\nto me, I understood jokes as well as most people: but in regard to the\nformer he must certainly have been wrong, for this bird seemed to me to\nbe extremely funny; and I could not help thinking that, if it should\nhappen to faint, or slip its foot, and fall off the twig into Peterkin's\nmouth, he would perhaps think it funny too!  Suddenly the paroquet bent\ndown its head and uttered a loud scream in his face.  This awoke him,\nand, with a cry of surprise, he started up, while the foolish bird flew\nprecipitately away.\n\n\"Oh you monster!\" cried Peterkin, shaking his fist at the bird.  Then he\nyawned and rubbed his eyes, and asked what o'clock it was.\n\nI smiled at this question, and answered that, as our watches were at the\nbottom of the sea, I could not tell, but it was a little past sunrise.\n\nPeterkin now began to remember where we were.  As he looked up into the\nbright sky, and snuffed the scented air, his eyes glistened with delight,\nand he uttered a faint \"hurrah!\" and yawned again.  Then he gazed slowly\nround, till, observing the calm sea through an opening in the bushes, he\nstarted suddenly up as if he had received an electric shock, uttered a\nvehement shout, flung off his garments, and, rushing over the white\nsands, plunged into the water.  The cry awoke Jack, who rose on his elbow\nwith a look of grave surprise; but this was followed by a quiet smile of\nintelligence on seeing Peterkin in the water.  With an energy that he\nonly gave way to in moments of excitement, Jack bounded to his feet,\nthrew off his clothes, shook back his hair, and with a lion-like spring,\ndashed over the sands and plunged into the sea with such force as quite\nto envelop Peterkin in a shower of spray.  Jack was a remarkably good\nswimmer and diver, so that after his plunge we saw no sign of him for\nnearly a minute; after which he suddenly emerged, with a cry of joy, a\ngood many yards out from the shore.  My spirits were so much raised by\nseeing all this that I, too, hastily threw off my garments and\nendeavoured to imitate Jack's vigorous bound; but I was so awkward that\nmy foot caught on a stump, and I fell to the ground; then I slipped on a\nstone while running over the mud, and nearly fell again, much to the\namusement of Peterkin, who laughed heartily, and called me a \"slow\ncoach,\" while Jack cried out, \"Come along, Ralph, and I'll help you.\"\nHowever, when I got into the water I managed very well, for I was really\na good swimmer, and diver too.  I could not, indeed, equal Jack, who was\nsuperior to any Englishman I ever saw, but I infinitely surpassed\nPeterkin, who could only swim a little, and could not dive at all.\n\nWhile Peterkin enjoyed himself in the shallow water and in running along\nthe beach, Jack and I swam out into the deep water, and occasionally\ndived for stones.  I shall never forget my surprise and delight on first\nbeholding the bottom of the sea.  As I have before stated, the water\nwithin the reef was as calm as a pond; and, as there was no wind, it was\nquite clear, from the surface to the bottom, so that we could see down\neasily even at a depth of twenty or thirty yards.  When Jack and I dived\nin shallower water, we expected to have found sand and stones, instead of\nwhich we found ourselves in what appeared really to be an enchanted\ngarden.  The whole of the bottom of the lagoon, as we called the calm\nwater within the reef, was covered with coral of every shape, size, and\nhue.  Some portions were formed like large mushrooms; others appeared\nlike the brain of a man, having stalks or necks attached to them; but the\nmost common kind was a species of branching coral, and some portions were\nof a lovely pale pink colour, others pure white.  Among this there grew\nlarge quantities of sea-weed of the richest hues imaginable, and of the\nmost graceful forms; while innumerable fishes--blue, red, yellow, green,\nand striped--sported in and out amongst the flower-beds of this submarine\ngarden, and did not appear to be at all afraid of our approaching them.\n\nOn darting to the surface for breath, after our first dive, Jack and I\nrose close to each other.\n\n\"Did you ever in your life, Ralph, see anything so lovely?\" said Jack, as\nhe flung the spray from his hair.\n\n\"Never,\" I replied.  \"It appears to me like fairy realms.  I can scarcely\nbelieve that we are not dreaming.\"\n\n\"Dreaming!\" cried Jack, \"do you know, Ralph, I'm half tempted to think\nthat we really are dreaming.  But if so, I am resolved to make the most\nof it, and dream another dive; so here goes,--down again, my boy!\"\n\nWe took the second dive together, and kept beside each other while under\nwater; and I was greatly surprised to find that we could keep down much\nlonger than I ever recollect having done in our own seas at home.  I\nbelieve that this was owing to the heat of the water, which was so warm\nthat we afterwards found we could remain in it for two and three hours at\na time without feeling any unpleasant effects such as we used to\nexperience in the sea at home.  When Jack reached the bottom, he grasped\nthe coral stems, and crept along on his hands and knees, peeping under\nthe sea-weed and among the rocks.  I observed him also pick up one or two\nlarge oysters, and retain them in his grasp, as if he meant to take them\nup with him, so I also gathered a few.  Suddenly he made a grasp at a\nfish with blue and yellow stripes on its back, and actually touched its\ntail, but did not catch it.  At this he turned towards me and attempted\nto smile; but no sooner had he done so than he sprang like an arrow to\nthe surface, where, on following him, I found him gasping and coughing,\nand spitting water from his mouth.  In a few minutes he recovered, and we\nboth turned to swim ashore.\n\n\"I declare, Ralph,\" said he, \"that I actually tried to laugh under\nwater.\"\n\n\"So I saw,\" I replied; \"and I observed that you very nearly caught that\nfish by the tail.  It would have done capitally for breakfast if you\nhad.\"\n\n\"Breakfast enough here,\" said he, holding up the oysters, as we landed\nand ran up the beach.  \"Hallo!  Peterkin, here you are, boy.  Split open\nthese fellows while Ralph and I put on our clothes.  They'll agree with\nthe cocoa nuts excellently, I have no doubt.\"\n\nPeterkin, who was already dressed, took the oysters, and opened them with\nthe edge of our axe, exclaiming, \"Now, that _is_ capital.  There's\nnothing I'm so fond of.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's lucky,\" remarked Jack.  \"I'll be able to keep you in good\norder now, Master Peterkin.  You know you can't dive any better than a\ncat.  So, sir, whenever you behave ill, you shall have no oysters for\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad that our prospect of breakfast is so good,\" said I, \"for\nI'm very hungry.\"\n\n\"Here, then, stop your mouth with that, Ralph,\" said Peterkin, holding a\nlarge oyster to my lips.  I opened my mouth and swallowed it in silence,\nand really it was remarkably good.\n\nWe now set ourselves earnestly about our preparations for spending the\nday.  We had no difficulty with the fire this morning, as our burning-\nglass was an admirable one; and while we roasted a few oysters and ate\nour cocoa nuts, we held a long, animated conversation about our plans for\nthe future.  What those plans were, and how we carried them into effect,\nthe reader shall see hereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nAn excursion into the interior, in which we make many valuable and\ninteresting discoveries--We get a dreadful fright--The bread-fruit\ntree--Wonderful peculiarity of some of the fruit trees--Signs of former\ninhabitants.\n\nOur first care, after breakfast, was to place the few articles we\npossessed in the crevice of a rock at the farther end of a small cave\nwhich we discovered near our encampment.  This cave, we hoped, might be\nuseful to us afterwards as a store-house.  Then we cut two large clubs\noff a species of very hard tree which grew near at hand.  One of these\nwas given to Peterkin, the other to me, and Jack armed himself with the\naxe.  We took these precautions because we purposed to make an excursion\nto the top of the mountains of the interior, in order to obtain a better\nview of our island.  Of course we knew not what dangers might befall us\nby the way, so thought it best to be prepared.\n\nHaving completed our arrangements and carefully extinguished our fire, we\nsallied forth and walked a short distance along the sea-beach, till we\ncame to the entrance of a valley, through which flowed the rivulet before\nmentioned.  Here we turned our backs on the sea and struck into the\ninterior.\n\nThe prospect that burst upon our view on entering the valley was truly\nsplendid.  On either side of us there was a gentle rise in the land,\nwhich thus formed two ridges about a mile apart on each side of the\nvalley.  These ridges,--which, as well as the low grounds between them,\nwere covered with trees and shrubs of the most luxuriant kind--continued\nto recede inland for about two miles, when they joined the foot of a\nsmall mountain.  This hill rose rather abruptly from the head of the\nvalley, and was likewise entirely covered even to the top with trees,\nexcept on one particular spot near the left shoulder, where was a bare\nand rocky place of a broken and savage character.  Beyond this hill we\ncould not see, and we therefore directed our course up the banks of the\nrivulet towards the foot of it, intending to climb to the top, should\nthat be possible, as, indeed, we had no doubt it was.\n\nJack, being the wisest and boldest among us, took the lead, carrying the\naxe on his shoulder.  Peterkin, with his enormous club, came second, as\nhe said he should like to be in a position to defend me if any danger\nshould threaten.  I brought up the rear, but, having been more taken up\nwith the wonderful and curious things I saw at starting than with\nthoughts of possible danger, I had very foolishly left my club behind me.\nAlthough, as I have said the trees and bushes were very luxuriant, they\nwere not so thickly crowded together as to hinder our progress among\nthem.  We were able to wind in and out, and to follow the banks of the\nstream quite easily, although, it is true, the height and thickness of\nthe foliage prevented us from seeing far ahead.  But sometimes a jutting-\nout rock on the hill sides afforded us a position whence we could enjoy\nthe romantic view and mark our progress towards the foot of the hill.  I\nwag particularly struck, during the walk, with the richness of the\nundergrowth in most places, and recognised many berries and plants that\nresembled those of my native land, especially a tall, elegantly-formed\nfern, which emitted an agreeable perfume.  There were several kinds of\nflowers, too, but I did not see so many of these as I should have\nexpected in such a climate.  We also saw a great variety of small birds\nof bright plumage, and many paroquets similar to the one that awoke\nPeterkin so rudely in the morning.\n\nThus we advanced to the foot of the hill without encountering anything to\nalarm us, except, indeed, once, when we were passing close under a part\nof the hill which was hidden from our view by the broad leaves of the\nbanana trees, which grew in great luxuriance in that part.  Jack was just\npreparing to force his way through this thicket, when we were startled\nand arrested by a strange pattering or rumbling sound, which appeared to\nus quite different from any of the sounds we had heard during the\nprevious part of our walk.\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried Peterkin, stopping short and grasping his club with both\nhands, \"what's that?\"\n\nNeither of us replied; but Jack seized his axe in his right hand, while\nwith the other he pushed aside the broad leaves and endeavoured to peer\namongst them.\n\n\"I can see nothing,\" he said, after a short pause.\n\n\"I think it--\"\n\nAgain the rumbling sound came, louder than before, and we all sprang back\nand stood on the defensive.  For myself, having forgotten my club, and\nnot having taken the precaution to cut another, I buttoned my jacket,\ndoubled my fists, and threw myself into a boxing attitude.  I must say,\nhowever, that I felt somewhat uneasy; and my companions afterwards\nconfessed that their thoughts at this moment had been instantly filled\nwith all they had ever heard or read of wild beasts and savages,\ntorturings at the stake, roastings alive, and such like horrible things.\nSuddenly the pattering noise increased with tenfold violence.  It was\nfollowed by a fearful crash among the bushes, which was rapidly repeated,\nas if some gigantic animal were bounding towards us.  In another moment\nan enormous rock came crashing through the shrubbery, followed by a cloud\nof dust and small stones, flew close past the spot where we stood,\ncarrying bushes and young trees along with it.\n\n\"Pooh! is that all?\" exclaimed Peterkin, wiping the perspiration off his\nforehead.  \"Why, I thought it was all the wild men and beasts in the\nSouth Sea Islands galloping on in one grand charge to sweep us off the\nface of the earth, instead of a mere stone tumbling down the mountain\nside.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" remarked Jack, \"if that same stone had hit any of us, it\nwould have rendered the charge you speak of quite unnecessary, Peterkin.\"\n\nThis was true, and I felt very thankful for our escape.  On examining the\nspot more narrowly, we found that it lay close to the foot of a very\nrugged precipice, from which stones of various sizes were always tumbling\nat intervals.  Indeed, the numerous fragments lying scattered all around\nmight have suggested the cause of the sound, had we not been too suddenly\nalarmed to think of anything.\n\nWe now resumed our journey, resolving that, in our future excursions into\nthe interior, we would be careful to avoid this dangerous precipice.\n\nSoon afterwards we arrived at the foot of the hill and prepared to ascend\nit.  Here Jack made a discovery which caused us all very great joy.  This\nwas a tree of a remarkably beautiful appearance, which Jack confidently\ndeclared to be the celebrated bread-fruit tree.\n\n\"Is it celebrated?\" inquired Peterkin, with a look of great simplicity.\n\n\"It is,\" replied Jack\n\n\"That's odd, now,\" rejoined Peterkin; \"never heard of it before.\"\n\n\"Then it's not so celebrated as I thought it was,\" returned Jack, quietly\nsqueezing Peterkin's hat over his eyes; \"but listen, you ignorant boobie!\nand hear of it now.\"\n\nPeterkin re-adjusted his hat, and was soon listening with as much\ninterest as myself, while Jack told us that this tree is one of the most\nvaluable in the islands of the south; that it bears two, sometimes three,\ncrops of fruit in the year; that the fruit is very like wheaten bread in\nappearance, and that it constitutes the principal food of many of the\nislanders.\n\n\"So,\" said Peterkin, \"we seem to have everything ready prepared to our\nhands in this wonderful island,--lemonade ready bottled in nuts, and loaf-\nbread growing on the trees!\"\n\nPeterkin, as usual, was jesting; nevertheless, it is a curious fact that\nhe spoke almost the literal truth.  \"Moreover,\" continued Jack, \"the\nbread-fruit tree affords a capital gum, which serves the natives for\npitching their canoes; the bark of the young branches is made by them\ninto cloth; and of the wood, which is durable and of a good colour, they\nbuild their houses.  So you see, lads, that we have no lack of material\nhere to make us comfortable, if we are only clever enough to use it.\"\n\n\"But are you sure that that's it?\" asked Peterkin.\n\n\"Quite sure,\" replied Jack; \"for I was particularly interested in the\naccount I once read of it, and I remember the description well.  I am\nsorry, however, that I have forgotten the descriptions of many other\ntrees which I am sure we have seen to-day, if we could but recognise\nthem.  So you see, Peterkin, I'm not up to everything yet.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Jack,\" said Peterkin, with a grave, patronizing expression\nof countenance, patting his tall companion on the shoulder,--\"never mind,\nJack; you know a good deal for your age.  You're a clever boy, sir,--a\npromising young man; and if you only go on as you have begun, sir, you\nwill--\"\n\nThe end of this speech was suddenly cut short by Jack tripping up\nPeterkin's heels and tumbling him into a mass of thick shrubs, where,\nfinding himself comfortable, he lay still basking in the sunshine, while\nJack and I examined the bread-tree.\n\nWe were much struck with the deep, rich green colour of its broad leaves,\nwhich were twelve or eighteen inches long, deeply indented, and of a\nglossy smoothness, like the laurel.  The fruit, with which it was loaded,\nwas nearly round, and appeared to be about six inches in diameter, with a\nrough rind, marked with lozenge-shaped divisions.  It was of various\ncolours, from light pea-green to brown and rich yellow.  Jack said that\nthe yellow was the ripe fruit.  We afterwards found that most of the\nfruit-trees on the island were evergreens, and that we might, when we\nwished, pluck the blossom and the ripe fruit from the same tree.  Such a\nwonderful difference from the trees of our own country surprised us not a\nlittle.  The bark of the tree was rough and light-coloured; the trunk was\nabout two feet in diameter, and it appeared to be twenty feet high, being\nquite destitute of branches up to that height, where it branched off into\na beautiful and umbrageous head.  We noticed that the fruit hung in\nclusters of twos and threes on the branches; but as we were anxious to\nget to the top of the hill, we refrained from attempting to pluck any at\nthat time.\n\nOur hearts were now very much cheered by our good fortune, and it was\nwith light and active steps that we clambered up the steep sides of the\nhill.  On reaching the summit, a new, and if possible a grander, prospect\nmet our gaze.  We found that this was not the highest part of the island,\nbut that another hill lay beyond, with a wide valley between it and the\none on which we stood.  This valley, like the first, was also full of\nrich trees, some dark and some light green, some heavy and thick in\nfoliage, and others light, feathery, and graceful, while the beautiful\nblossoms on many of them threw a sort of rainbow tint over all, and gave\nto the valley the appearance of a garden of flowers.  Among these we\nrecognised many of the bread-fruit trees, laden with yellow fruit, and\nalso a great many cocoa-nut palms.  After gazing our fill we pushed down\nthe hill side, crossed the valley, and soon began to ascend the second\nmountain.  It was clothed with trees nearly to the top, but the summit\nwas bare, and in some places broken.\n\nWhile on our way up we came to an object which filled us with much\ninterest.  This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down\nwith an axe!  So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this\nbeautiful isle.  The hand of man had been at work there before us.  It\nnow began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited,\nalthough we had not seen any traces of man until now; but a second glance\nat the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so now\nthan formerly; for the surface of the wood was quite decayed, and partly\ncovered with fungus and green matter, so that it must have been cut many\nyears ago.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"some ship or other has touched here long ago\nfor wood, and only taken one tree.\"\n\nWe did not think this likely, however, because, in such circumstances,\nthe crew of a ship would cut wood of small size, and near the shore,\nwhereas this was a large tree and stood near the top of the mountain.  In\nfact it was the highest large tree on the mountain, all above it being\nwood of very recent growth.\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" said Jack, scratching the surface of the stump\nwith his axe.  \"I can only suppose that the savages have been here and\ncut it for some purpose known only to themselves.  But, hallo! what have\nwe here?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Jack began carefully to scrape away the moss and fungus from\nthe stump, and soon laid bare three distinct traces of marks, as if some\ninscription or initials had been cut thereon.  But although the traces\nwere distinct, beyond all doubt, the exact form of the letters could not\nbe made out.  Jack thought they looked like J. S. but we could not be\ncertain.  They had apparently been carelessly cut, and long exposure to\nthe weather had so broken them up that we could not make out what they\nwere.  We were exceedingly perplexed at this discovery, and stayed a long\ntime at the place conjecturing what these marks could have been, but\nwithout avail; so, as the day was advancing, we left it and quickly\nreached the top of the mountain.\n\nWe found this to be the highest point of the island, and from it we saw\nour kingdom lying, as it were, like a map around us.  As I have always\nthought it impossible to get a thing properly into one's understanding\nwithout comprehending it, I shall beg the reader's patience for a little\nwhile I describe our island, thus, shortly:--\n\nIt consisted of two mountains; the one we guessed at 500 feet; the other,\non which we stood, at 1000.  Between these lay a rich, beautiful valley,\nas already said.  This valley crossed the island from one end to the\nother, being high in the middle and sloping on each side towards the sea.\nThe large mountain sloped, on the side farthest from where we had been\nwrecked, gradually towards the sea; but although, when viewed at a\nglance, it had thus a regular sloping appearance, a more careful\nobservation showed that it was broken up into a multitude of very small\nvales, or rather dells and glens, intermingled with little rugged spots\nand small but abrupt precipices here and there, with rivulets tumbling\nover their edges and wandering down the slopes in little white streams,\nsometimes glistening among the broad leaves of the bread-fruit and cocoa-\nnut trees, or hid altogether beneath the rich underwood.  At the base of\nthis mountain lay a narrow bright green plain or meadow, which terminated\nabruptly at the shore.  On the other side of the island, whence we had\ncome, stood the smaller hill, at the foot of which diverged three\nvalleys; one being that which we had ascended, with a smaller vale on\neach side of it, and separated from it by the two ridges before\nmentioned.  In these smaller valleys there were no streams, but they were\nclothed with the same luxuriant vegetation.\n\nThe diameter of the island seemed to be about ten miles, and, as it was\nalmost circular in form, its circumference must have been thirty\nmiles;--perhaps a little more, if allowance be made for the numerous bays\nand indentations of the shore.  The entire island was belted by a beach\nof pure white sand, on which laved the gentle ripples of the lagoon.  We\nnow also observed that the coral reef completely encircled the island;\nbut it varied its distance from it here and there, in some places being a\nmile from the beach, in others, a few hundred yards, but the average\ndistance was half a mile.  The reef lay very low, and the spray of the\nsurf broke quite over it in many places.  This surf never ceased its\nroar, for, however calm the weather might be, there is always a gentle\nswaying motion in the great Pacific, which, although scarce noticeable\nout at sea, reaches the shore at last in a huge billow.  The water within\nthe lagoon, as before said, was perfectly still.  There were three narrow\nopenings in the reef; one opposite each end of the valley which I have\ndescribed as crossing the island; the other opposite our own valley,\nwhich we afterwards named the Valley of the Wreck.  At each of these\nopenings the reef rose into two small green islets, covered with bushes\nand having one or two cocoa-nut palms on each.  These islets were very\nsingular, and appeared as if planted expressly for the purpose of marking\nthe channel into the lagoon.  Our captain was making for one of these\nopenings the day we were wrecked, and would have reached it too, I doubt\nnot, had not the rudder been torn away.  Within the lagoon were several\npretty, low coral islands, just opposite our encampment; and, immediately\nbeyond these, out at sea, lay about a dozen other islands, at various\ndistances, from half a mile to ten miles; all of them, as far as we could\ndiscern, smaller than ours and apparently uninhabited.  They seemed to be\nlow coral islands, raised but little above the sea, yet covered with\ncocoa-nut trees.\n\nAll this we noted, and a great deal more, while we sat on the top of the\nmountain.  After we had satisfied ourselves we prepared to return; but\nhere again we discovered traces of the presence of man.  These were a\npole or staff and one or two pieces of wood which had been squared with\nan axe.  All of these were, however, very much decayed, and they had\nevidently not been touched for many years.\n\nFull of these discoveries we returned to our encampment.  On the way we\nfell in with the traces of some four-footed animal, but whether old or of\nrecent date none of us were able to guess.  This also tended to raise our\nhopes of obtaining some animal food on the island, so we reached home in\ngood spirits, quite prepared for supper, and highly satisfied with our\nexcursion.\n\nAfter much discussion, in which Peterkin took the lead, we came to the\nconclusion that the island was uninhabited, and went to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nJack's ingenuity--We get into difficulties about fishing, and get out of\nthem by a method which gives us a cold bath--Horrible encounter with a\nshark.\n\nFor several days after the excursion related in the last chapter we did\nnot wander far from our encampment, but gave ourselves up to forming\nplans for the future and making our present abode comfortable.\n\nThere were various causes that induced this state of comparative\ninaction.  In the first place, although everything around us was so\ndelightful, and we could without difficulty obtain all that we required\nfor our bodily comfort, we did not quite like the idea of settling down\nhere for the rest of our lives, far away from our friends and our native\nland.  To set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence\nseemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and friends\nfor ever, that we tacitly shrank from it and put off our preparations,\nfor one reason and another, as long as we could.  Then there was a little\nuncertainty still as to there being natives on the island, and we\nentertained a kind of faint hope that a ship might come and take us off.\nBut as day after day passed, and neither savages nor ships appeared, we\ngave up all hope of an early deliverance and set diligently to work at\nour homestead.\n\nDuring this time, however, we had not been altogether idle.  We made\nseveral experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut, most of which did not\nimprove it.  Then we removed our goods, and took up our abode in the\ncave, but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower.\nBesides this we bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal; at least\nJack and Peterkin did,--I listened.  Among other useful things, Jack, who\nwas ever the most active and diligent, converted about three inches of\nthe hoop-iron into an excellent knife.  First he beat it quite flat with\nthe axe.  Then he made a rude handle, and tied the hoop-iron to it with\nour piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge on a piece of\nsand-stone.  When it was finished he used it to shape a better handle, to\nwhich he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchief;--in which\noperation he had, as Peterkin pointed out, torn off one of Lord Nelson's\nnoses.  However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by Peterkin as a\nfishing line.  He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end of it.  This\nthe fish were allowed to swallow, and then they were pulled quickly\nashore.  But as the line was very short and we had no boat, the fish we\ncaught were exceedingly small.\n\nOne day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been angling, and\nsaid in a very cross tone, \"I'll tell you what, Jack, I'm not going to be\nhumbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer.  I want you\nto swim out with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!\"\n\n\"Dear me, Peterkin,\" replied Jack, \"I had no idea you were taking the\nthing so much to heart, else I would have got you out of that difficulty\nlong ago.  Let me see,\"--and Jack looked down at a piece of timber on\nwhich he had been labouring, with a peculiar gaze of abstraction, which\nhe always assumed when trying to invent or discover anything.\n\n\"What say you to building a boat?\" he inquired, looking up hastily.\n\n\"Take far too long,\" was the reply; \"can't be bothered waiting.  I want\nto begin at once!\"\n\nAgain Jack considered.  \"I have it!\" he cried.  \"We'll fell a large tree\nand launch the trunk of it in the water, so that when you want to fish\nyou've nothing to do but to swim out to it.\"\n\n\"Would not a small raft do better?\" said I.\n\n\"Much better; but we have no ropes to bind it together with.  Perhaps we\nmay find something hereafter that will do as well, but, in the meantime,\nlet us try the tree.\"\n\nThis was agreed on, so we started off to a spot not far distant, where we\nknew of a tree that would suit us, which grew near the water's edge.  As\nsoon as we reached it Jack threw off his coat, and, wielding the axe with\nhis sturdy arms, hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour without\nstopping.  Then he paused, and, while he sat down to rest, I continued\nthe work.  Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on it, so that when Jack\nrenewed his powerful blows, a few minutes cutting brought it down with a\nterrible crash.\n\n\"Hurrah! now for it,\" cried Jack; \"let us off with its head.\"\n\nSo saying he began to cut through the stem again, at about six yards from\nthe thick end.  This done, he cut three strong, short poles or levers\nfrom the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the beach into\nthe sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large end, we could\nnot move it without such helps.  With the levers, however, we rolled it\nslowly into the sea.\n\nHaving been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next shaped the\nlevers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted to embark.  This was\neasy enough to do; but, after seating ourselves astride the log, it was\nwith the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and plunging us\ninto the water.  Not that we minded that much; but we preferred, if\npossible, to fish in dry clothes.  To be sure, our trousers were\nnecessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on each side of\nthe log; but, as they could be easily dried, we did not care.  After half\nan hour's practice, we became expert enough to keep our balance pretty\nsteadily.  Then Peterkin laid down his paddle, and having baited his line\nwith a whole oyster, dropt it into deep water.\n\n\"Now, then, Jack,\" said he, \"be cautious; steer clear o' that sea-weed.\nThere; that's it; gently, now, gently.  I see a fellow at least a foot\nlong down there, coming to--ha! that's it!  Oh! bother, he's off.\"\n\n\"Did he bite?\" said Jack, urging the log onwards a little with his\npaddle.\n\n\"Bite? ay!  He took it into his mouth, but the moment I began to haul he\nopened his jaws and let it out again.\"\n\n\"Let him swallow it next time,\" said Jack, laughing at the melancholy\nexpression of Peterkin's visage.\n\n\"There he's again,\" cried Peterkin, his eyes flashing with excitement.\n\"Look out!  Now then!  No!  Yes!  No!  Why, the brute _won't_ swallow\nit!\"\n\n\"Try to haul him up by the mouth, then,\" cried Jack.  \"Do it gently.\"\n\nA heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor Peterkin had\ntried and failed again.\n\n\"Never mind, lad,\" said Jack, in a voice of sympathy; \"we'll move on, and\noffer it to some other fish.\"  So saying, Jack plied his paddle; but\nscarcely had he moved from the spot, when a fish with an enormous head\nand a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at\nonce.\n\n\"Got him this time,--that's a fact!\" cried Peterkin, hauling in the line.\n\"He's swallowed the bait right down to his tail, I declare.  Oh what a\nthumper!\"\n\nAs the fish came struggling to the surface, we leaned forward to see it,\nand overbalanced the log.  Peterkin threw his arms round the fish's neck;\nand, in another instant, we were all floundering in the water!\n\nA shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface like three\ndrowned rats, and seized hold of the log.  We soon recovered our\nposition, and sat more warily, while Peterkin secured the fish, which had\nwell-nigh escaped in the midst of our struggles.  It was little worth\nhaving, however; but, as Peterkin remarked, it was better than the smouts\nhe had been catching for the last two or three days; so we laid it on the\nlog before us, and having re-baited the line, dropt it in again for\nanother.\n\nNow, while we were thus intent upon our sport, our attention was suddenly\nattracted by a ripple on the sea, just a few yards away from us.  Peterkin\nshouted to us to paddle in that direction, as he thought it was a big\nfish, and we might have a chance of catching it.  But Jack, instead of\ncomplying, said, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, which I never before\nheard him use,--\n\n\"Haul up your line, Peterkin; seize your paddle; quick,--it's a shark!\"\n\nThe horror with which we heard this may well be imagined, for it must be\nremembered that our legs were hanging down in the water, and we could not\nventure to pull them up without upsetting the log.  Peterkin instantly\nhauled up the line; and, grasping his paddle, exerted himself to the\nutmost, while we also did our best to make for shore.  But we were a good\nway off, and the log being, as I have before said, very heavy, moved but\nslowly through the water.  We now saw the shark quite distinctly swimming\nround and round us, its sharp fin every now and then protruding above the\nwater.  From its active and unsteady motions, Jack knew it was making up\nits mind to attack us, so he urged us vehemently to paddle for our lives,\nwhile he himself set us the example.  Suddenly he shouted \"Look\nout!--there he comes!\" and in a second we saw the monstrous fish dive\nclose under us, and turn half over on his side.  But we all made a great\ncommotion with our paddles, which no doubt frightened it away for that\ntime, as we saw it immediately after circling round us as before.\n\n\"Throw the fish to him,\" cried Jack, in a quick, suppressed voice; \"we'll\nmake the shore in time yet if we can keep him off for a few minutes.\"\n\nPeterkin stopped one instant to obey the command, and then plied his\npaddle again with all his might.  No sooner had the fish fallen on the\nwater than we observed the shark to sink.  In another second we saw its\nwhite breast rising; for sharks always turn over on their sides when\nabout to seize their prey, their mouths being not at the point of their\nheads like those of other fish, but, as it were, under their chins.  In\nanother moment his snout rose above the water,--his wide jaws, armed with\na terrific double row of teeth, appeared.  The dead fish was engulfed,\nand the shark sank out of sight.  But Jack was mistaken in supposing that\nit would be satisfied.  In a very few minutes it returned to us, and its\nquick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once.\n\n\"Stop paddling,\" cried Jack suddenly.  \"I see it coming up behind us.\nNow, obey my orders quickly.  Our lives may depend on it Ralph.  Peterkin,\ndo your best to _balance the log_.  Don't look out for the shark.  Don't\nglance behind you.  Do nothing but balance the log.\"\n\n{A dreadful adventure: p77.jpg}\n\nPeterkin and I instantly did as we were ordered, being only too glad to\ndo anything that afforded us a chance or a hope of escape, for we had\nimplicit confidence in Jack's courage and wisdom.  For a few seconds,\nthat seemed long minutes to my mind, we sat thus silently; but I could\nnot resist glancing backward, despite the orders to the contrary.  On\ndoing so, I saw Jack sitting rigid like a statue, with his paddle raised,\nhis lips compressed, and his eye-brows bent over his eyes, which glared\nsavagely from beneath them down into the water.  I also saw the shark, to\nmy horror, quite close under the log, in the act of darting towards\nJack's foot.  I could scarce suppress a cry on beholding this.  In\nanother moment the shark rose.  Jack drew his leg suddenly from the\nwater, and threw it over the log.  The monster's snout rubbed against the\nlog as it passed, and revealed its hideous jaws, into which Jack\ninstantly plunged the paddle, and thrust it down its throat.  So violent\nwas the act that Jack rose to his feet in performing it; the log was\nthereby rolled completely over, and we were once more plunged into the\nwater.  We all rose, spluttering and gasping, in a moment.\n\n\"Now then, strike out for shore,\" cried Jack.  \"Here, Peterkin, catch\nhold of my collar, and kick out with a will.\"\n\nPeterkin did as he was desired, and Jack struck out with such force that\nhe cut through the water like a boat; while I, being free from all\nencumbrance, succeeded in keeping up with him.  As we had by this time\ndrawn pretty near to the shore, a few minutes more sufficed to carry us\ninto shallow water; and, finally, we landed in safety, though very much\nexhausted, and not a little frightened by our terrible adventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nThe beauties of the bottom of the sea tempt Peterkin to dive--How he did\nit--More difficulties overcome--The water garden--Curious creatures of\nthe sea--The tank--Candles missed very much, and the candle-nut tree\ndiscovered--Wonderful account of Peterkin's first voyage--Cloth found\ngrowing on a tree--A plan projected, and arms prepared for offence and\ndefence--A dreadful cry.\n\nOur encounter with the shark was the first great danger that had befallen\nus since landing on this island, and we felt very seriously affected by\nit, especially when we considered that we had so often unwittingly\nincurred the same danger before while bathing.  We were now forced to\ntake to fishing again in the shallow water, until we should succeed in\nconstructing a raft.  What troubled us most, however, was, that we were\ncompelled to forego our morning swimming excursions.  We did, indeed,\ncontinue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water, but Jack and I found\nthat one great source of our enjoyment was gone, when we could no longer\ndive down among the beautiful coral groves at the bottom of the lagoon.\nWe had come to be so fond of this exercise, and to take such an interest\nin watching the formations of coral and the gambols of the many beautiful\nfish amongst the forests of red and green sea-weeds, that we had become\nquite familiar with the appearance of the fish and the localities that\nthey chiefly haunted.  We had also become expert divers.  But we made it\na rule never to stay long under water at a time.  Jack told me that to do\nso often was bad for the lungs, and, instead of affording us enjoyment,\nwould ere long do us a serious injury.  So we never stayed at the bottom\nas long as we might have done, but came up frequently to the top for\nfresh air, and dived down again immediately.  Sometimes, when Jack\nhappened to be in a humorous frame, he would seat himself at the bottom\nof the sea on one of the brain corals, as if he were seated on a large\npaddock-stool, and then make faces at me, in order, if possible, to make\nme laugh under water.  At first, when he took me unawares, he nearly\nsucceeded, and I had to shoot to the surface in order to laugh; but\nafterwards I became aware of his intentions, and, being naturally of a\ngrave disposition, I had no difficulty in restraining myself.  I used\noften to wonder how poor Peterkin would have liked to be with us; and he\nsometimes expressed much regret at being unable to join us.  I used to do\nmy best to gratify him, poor fellow, by relating all the wonders that we\nsaw; but this, instead of satisfying, seemed only to whet his curiosity\nthe more, so one day we prevailed on him to try to go down with us.  But,\nalthough a brave boy in every other way, Peterkin was very nervous in the\nwater, and it was with difficulty we got him to consent to be taken down,\nfor he could never have managed to push himself down to the bottom\nwithout assistance.  But no sooner had we pulled him down a yard or so\ninto the deep clear water, than he began to struggle and kick violently,\nso we were forced to let him go, when he rose out of the water like a\ncork, gave a loud gasp and a frightful roar, and struck out for the land\nwith the utmost possible haste.\n\nNow, all this pleasure we were to forego, and when we thought thereon,\nJack and I felt very much depressed in our spirits.  I could see, also,\nthat Peterkin grieved and sympathized with us, for, when talking about\nthis matter, he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.\n\nAs, however, a man's difficulties usually set him upon devising methods\nto overcome them, whereby he often discovers better things than those he\nmay have lost, so this our difficulty induced us to think of searching\nfor a large pool among the rocks, where the water should be deep enough\nfor diving yet so surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting\nat us.  And such a pool we afterwards found, which proved to be very much\nbetter than our most sanguine hopes anticipated.  It was situated not\nmore than ten minutes' walk from our camp, and was in the form of a small\ndeep bay or basin, the entrance to which, besides being narrow, was so\nshallow that no fish so large as a shark could get in, at least not\nunless he should be a remarkably thin one.\n\nInside of this basin, which we called our Water Garden, the coral\nformations were much more wonderful, and the sea-weed plants far more\nlovely and vividly coloured, than in the lagoon itself.  And the water\nwas so clear and still, that, although very deep, you could see the\nminutest object at the bottom.  Besides this, there was a ledge of rock\nwhich overhung the basin at its deepest part, from which we could dive\npleasantly and whereon Peterkin could sit and see not only all the\nwonders I had described to him, but also see Jack and me creeping amongst\nthe marine shrubbery at the bottom, like, as--he expressed it,--\"two\ngreat white sea-monsters.\"  During these excursions of ours to the bottom\nof the sea, we began to get an insight into the manners and customs of\nits inhabitants, and to make discoveries of wonderful things, the like of\nwhich we never before conceived.  Among other things, we were deeply\ninterested with the operations of the little coral insect which, I was\ninformed by Jack, is supposed to have entirely constructed many of the\nnumerous islands in Pacific Ocean.  And, certainly, when we considered\nthe great reef which these insects had formed round the island on which\nwe were cast, and observed their ceaseless activity in building their\nmyriad cells, it did at first seem as if this might be true; but then,\nagain, when I looked at the mountains of the island, and reflected that\nthere were thousands of such, many of them much higher, in the South\nSeas, I doubted that there must be some mistake here.  But more of this\nhereafter.\n\nI also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of the\nanemones, and star-fish, and crabs, and sea-urchins, and such-like\ncreatures; and was not content with watching those I saw during my dives\nin the Water Garden, but I must needs scoop out a hole in the coral rock\nclose to it, which I filled with salt water, and stocked with sundry\nspecimens of anemones and shell-fish, in order to watch more closely how\nthey were in the habit of passing their time.  Our burning-glass also now\nbecame a great treasure to me, as it enabled me to magnify, and so to\nperceive more clearly the forms and actions of these curious creatures of\nthe deep.\n\nHaving now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition, we began to\ntalk of a project which we had long had in contemplation,--namely, to\ntravel entirely round the island; in order, first, to ascertain whether\nit contained any other productions which might be useful to us; and,\nsecond, to see whether there might be any place more convenient and\nsuitable for our permanent residence than that on which we were now\nencamped.  Not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with it; on the\ncontrary, we entertained quite a home-feeling to our bower and its\nneighbourhood; but if a better place did exist, there was no reason why\nwe should not make use of it.  At any rate, it would be well to know of\nits existence.\n\nWe had much earnest talk over this matter.  But Jack proposed that,\nbefore undertaking such an excursion, we should supply ourselves with\ngood defensive arms, for, as we intended not only to go round all the\nshore, but to ascend most of the valleys, before returning home, we\nshould be likely to meet in with, he would not say dangers, but, at\nleast, with everything that existed on the island, whatever that might\nbe.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Jack, \"it won't do for us to live on cocoa-nuts and\noysters always.  No doubt they are very excellent in their way, but I\nthink a little animal food, now and then, would be agreeable as well as\ngood for us; and as there are many small birds among the trees, some of\nwhich are probably very good to eat, I think it would be a capital plan\nto make bows and arrows, with which we could easily knock them over.\"\n\n\"First rate!\" cried Peterkin.  \"You will make the bows, Jack, and I'll\ntry my hand at the arrows.  The fact is, I'm quite tired of throwing\nstones at the birds.  I began the very day we landed, I think, and have\npersevered up to the present time, but I've never hit anything yet.\"\n\n\"You forget,\" said I, \"you hit me one day on the shin.\"\n\n\"Ah, true,\" replied Peterkin, \"and a precious shindy you kicked up in\nconsequence.  But you were at least four yards away from the impudent\nparoquet I aimed at; so you see what a horribly bad shot I am.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"Jack, you cannot make three bows and arrows before to-\nmorrow, and would it not be a pity to waste time, now that we have made\nup our minds to go on this expedition?  Suppose that you make one bow and\narrow for yourself, and we can take our clubs?\"\n\n\"That's true, Ralph.  The day is pretty far advanced, and I doubt if I\ncan make even one bow before dark.  To be sure I might work by\nfire-light, after the sun goes down.\"\n\nWe had, up to this time, been in the habit of going to bed with the sun,\nas we had no pressing call to work o' nights; and, indeed, our work\nduring the day was usually hard enough,--what between fishing, and\nimproving our bower, and diving in the Water Garden, and rambling in the\nwoods; so that, when night came, we were usually very glad to retire to\nour beds.  But now that we had a desire to work at night, we felt a wish\nfor candles.\n\n\"Won't a good blazing fire give you light enough?\" inquired Peterkin.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"quite enough; but then it will give us a great deal\nmore than enough of heat in this warm climate of ours.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Peterkin; \"I forgot that.  It would roast us.\"\n\n\"Well, as you're always doing that at any rate,\" remarked Jack, \"we could\nscarcely call it a change.  But the fact is, I've been thinking over this\nsubject before.  There is a certain nut growing in these islands which is\ncalled the candle-nut, because the natives use it instead of candles, and\nI know all about it, and how to prepare it for burning--\"\n\n\"Then why don't you do it?\" interrupted Peterkin.  \"Why have you kept us\nin the dark so long, you vile philosopher?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Jack, \"I have not seen the tree yet, and I'm not sure\nthat I should know either the tree or the nuts if I did see them.  You\nsee, I forget the description.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's just the way with me,\" said Peterkin with a deep sigh.  \"I\nnever could keep in my mind for half an hour the few descriptions I ever\nattempted to remember.  The very first voyage I ever made was caused by\nmy mistaking a description, or forgetting it, which is the same thing.\nAnd a horrible voyage it was.  I had to fight with the captain the whole\nway out, and made the homeward voyage by swimming!\"\n\n\"Come, Peterkin,\" said I, \"you can't get even _me_ to believe that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, but it's true, notwithstanding,\" returned Peterkin,\npretending to be hurt at my doubting his word.\n\n\"Let us hear how it happened,\" said Jack, while a good-natured smile\noverspread his face.\n\n\"Well, you must know,\" began Peterkin, \"that the very day before I went\nto sea, I was greatly taken up with a game at hockey, which I was playing\nwith my old school-fellows for the last time before leaving them.  You\nsee I was young then, Ralph.\"  Peterkin gazed, in an abstracted and\nmelancholy manner, out to sea!  \"Well, in the midst of the game, my\nuncle, who had taken all the bother and trouble of getting me bound\n'prentice and rigged out, came and took me aside, and told me that he was\ncalled suddenly away from home, and would not be able to see me aboard,\nas he had intended.  'However,' said he, 'the captain knows you are\ncoming, so that's not of much consequence; but as you'll have to find the\nship yourself, you must remember her name and description.  D'ye hear,\nboy?'  I certainly did hear, but I'm afraid I did not understand, for my\nmind was so taken up with the game, which I saw my side was losing, that\nI began to grow impatient, and the moment my uncle finished his\ndescription of the ship, and bade me good-bye, I bolted back to my game,\nwith only a confused idea of three masts, and a green painted tafferel,\nand a gilt figure-head of Hercules with his club at the bow.  Next day I\nwas so much cast down with everybody saying good-bye, and a lot o' my\nfemale friends cryin' horribly over me, that I did not start for the\nharbour, where the ship was lying among a thousand others, till it was\nalmost too late.  So I had to run the whole way.  When I reached the\npier, there were so many masts, and so much confusion, that I felt quite\nhumblebumbled in my faculties.  'Now,' said I to myself, 'Peterkin,\nyou're in a fix.'  Then I fancied I saw a gilt figure-head and three\nmasts, belonging to a ship just about to start; so I darted on board, but\nspeedily jumped on shore again, when I found that two of the masts\nbelonged to another vessel, and the figurehead to a third!  At last I\ncaught sight of what I made sure was it,--a fine large vessel just\ncasting off her moorings.  The tafferel was green.  Three masts,--yes,\nthat must be it,--and the gilt figure-head of Hercules.  To be sure it\nhad a three-pronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club; but that\nmight be my uncle's mistake; or perhaps Hercules sometimes varied his\nweapons.  'Cast off!' roared a voice from the quarter-deck.  'Hold on!'\ncried I, rushing frantically through the crowd.  'Hold on! hold on!'\nrepeated some of the bystanders, while the men at the ropes delayed for a\nminute.  This threw the captain into a frightful rage; for some of his\nfriends had come down to see him off, and having his orders contradicted\nso flatly was too much for him.  However, the delay was sufficient.  I\ntook a race and a good leap; the ropes were cast off; the steam-tug gave\na puff, and we started.  Suddenly the captain was up to me: 'Where did\nyou come from, you scamp, and what do you want here?'\n\n\"'Please, sir,' said I, touching my cap, 'I'm you're new 'prentice come\naboard.'\n\n\"'New 'Prentice,' said he, stamping, 'I've got no new 'prentice.  My boys\nare all aboard already.  This is a trick, you young blackguard.  You've\nrun away, you have;' and the captain stamped about the deck and swore\ndreadfully; for, you see, the thought of having to stop the ship and\nlower a boat and lose half an hour, all for the slake of sending a small\nboy ashore, seemed to make him very angry.  Besides, it was blowin' fresh\noutside the harbour, so that, to have let the steamer alongside to put me\ninto it was no easy job.  Just as we were passing the pier-head, where\nseveral boats were rowing into harbour, the captain came up to me,--\n\n\"'You've run away, you blackguard,' he said, giving me a box on the ear.\n\n\"'No I haven't,' said I, angrily; for the box was by no means a light\none.\n\n\"Hark'ee, boy, can you swim?'\n\n\"'Yes,' said I.\n\n\"'Then do it,' and, seizing me by my trousers and the nape of my neck, he\ntossed me over the side into the sea.  The fellows in the boats at the\nend of the pier, backed their oars on seeing this; but observing that I\ncould swim, they allowed me to make the best of my way to the pier-head.\nSo, you see, Ralph, that I really did swim my first homeward voyage.\"\n\nJack laughed and patted Peterkin on the shoulder.  \"But tell us about the\ncandle-nut tree,\" said I; \"you were talking about it.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Jack, \"but I fear I can remember little about it.  I\nbelieve the nut is about the size of a walnut; and I think that the\nleaves are white, but I am not sure.\"\n\n\"Eh! ha! hum!\" exclaimed Peterkin, \"I saw a tree answering to that\ndescription this very day.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" cried Jack.  \"Is it far from this?\"\n\n\"No, not half a mile.\"\n\n\"Then lead me to it,\" said Jack, seizing his axe.\n\nIn a few minutes we were all three pushing through the underwood of the\nforest, headed by Peterkin.\n\nWe soon came to the tree in question, which, after Jack had closely\nexamined it, we concluded must be the candle-nut tree.  Its leaves were\nof a beautiful silvery white, and formed a fine contrast to the\ndark-green foliage of the surrounding trees.  We immediately filled our\npockets with the nuts, after which Jack said,--\n\n\"Now, Peterkin, climb that cocoa-nut tree and cut me one of the long\nbranches.\"\n\nThis was soon done, but it cost some trouble, for the stem was very high,\nand as Peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger trees, he was not\nmuch accustomed to climbing the high ones.  The leaf or branch was a very\nlarge one, and we were surprised at its size and strength.  Viewed from a\nlittle distance, the cocoa-nut tree seems to be a tall, straight stem,\nwithout a single branch except at the top, where there is a tuft of\nfeathery-looking leaves, that seem to wave like soft plumes in the wind.\nBut when we saw one of these leaves or branches at our feet, we found it\nto be a strong stalk, about fifteen feet long, with a number of narrow,\npointed leaflets ranged alternately on each side.  But what seemed to us\nthe most wonderful thing about it was a curious substance resembling\ncloth, which was wrapped round the thick end of the stalk, where it had\nbeen cut from the tree.  Peterkin told us that he had the greatest\ndifficulty in separating the branch from the stem, on account of this\nsubstance, as it was wrapped quite round the tree, and, he observed,\nround all the other branches, thus forming a strong support to the large\nleaves while exposed to high winds.  When I call this substance cloth I\ndo not exaggerate.  Indeed, with regard to all the things I saw during my\neventful career in the South Seas, I have been exceedingly careful not to\nexaggerate, or in any way to mislead or deceive my readers.  This cloth,\nI say, was remarkably like to coarse brown cotton cloth.  It had a seam\nor fibre down the centre of it, from which diverged other fibres, about\nthe size of a bristle.  There were two layers of these fibres, very long\nand tough, the one layer crossing the other obliquely, and the whole was\ncemented together with a still finer fibrous and adhesive substance.  When\nwe regarded it attentively, we could with difficulty believe that it had\nnot been woven by human hands.  This remarkable piece of cloth we\nstripped carefully off, and found it to be above two feet long, by a foot\nbroad, and we carried it home with us as a great prize.\n\nJack now took one of the leaflets, and, cutting out the central spine or\nstalk, hurried back with it to our camp.  Having made a small fire, he\nbaked the nuts slightly, and then pealed off the husks.  After this he\nwished to bore a hole in them, which, not having anything better at hand\nat the time, he did with the point of our useless pencil-case.  Then he\nstrung them on the cocoa-nut spine, and on putting a light to the topmost\nnut, we found to our joy that it burned with a clear, beautiful flame;\nupon seeing which, Peterkin sprang up and danced round the fire for at\nleast five minutes in the excess of his satisfaction.\n\n\"Now lads,\" said Jack, extinguishing our candle, the sun will set in an\nhour, so we have no time to lose.  \"I shall go and cut a young tree to\nmake my bow out of, and you had better each of you go and select good\nstrong sticks for clubs, and we'll set to work at them after dark.\"\n\nSo saying he shouldered his axe and went off, followed by Peterkin, while\nI took up the piece of newly discovered cloth, and fell to examining its\nstructure.  So engrossed was I in this that I was still sitting in the\nsame attitude and occupation when my companions returned.\n\n\"I told you so!\" cried Peterkin, with a loud laugh.  \"Oh, Ralph, you're\nincorrigible.  See, there's a club for you.  I was sure, when we left you\nlooking at that bit of stuff, that we would find you poring over it when\nwe came back, so I just cut a club for you as well as for myself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Peterkin,\" said I.  \"It was kind of you to do that, instead\nof scolding me for a lazy fellow, as I confess I deserve.\"\n\n\"Oh! as to that,\" returned Peterkin, \"I'll blow you up yet, if you wish\nit--only it would be of no use if I did, for you're a perfect mule!\"\n\nAs it was now getting dark we lighted our candle, and placing it in a\nholder made of two crossing branches, inside of our bower, we seated\nourselves on our leafy beds and began to work.\n\n\"I intend to appropriate the bow for my own use,\" said Jack, chipping the\npiece of wood he had brought with his axe.  \"I used to be a pretty fair\nshot once.  But what's that you're doing?\" he added, looking at Peterkin,\nwho had drawn the end of a long pole into the tent, and was endeavouring\nto fit a small piece of the hoop-iron to the end of it.\n\n\"I'm going to enlist into the Lancers,\" answered Peterkin.  \"You see,\nJack, I find the club rather an unwieldy instrument for my delicately-\nformed muscles, and I flatter myself I shall do more execution with a\nspear.\"\n\n\"Well, if length constitutes power,\" said Jack, \"you'll certainly be\ninvincible.\"\n\nThe pole which Peterkin had cut was full twelve feet long, being a very\nstrong but light and tough young tree, which merely required thinning at\nthe butt to be a serviceable weapon.\n\n\"That's a very good idea,\" said I.\n\n\"Which--this?\" inquired Peterkin, pointing to the spear.\n\n\"Yes;\" I replied.\n\n\"Humph!\" said he; \"you'd find it a pretty tough and matter-of-fact idea,\nif you had it stuck through your gizzard, old boy!\"\n\n\"I mean the idea of making it is a good one,\" said I, laughing.  \"And,\nnow I think of it, I'll change my plan, too.  I don't think much of a\nclub, so I'll make me a sling out of this piece of cloth.  I used to be\nvery fond of slinging, ever since I read of David slaying Goliath the\nPhilistine, and I was once thought to be expert at it.\"\n\nSo I set to work to manufacture a sling.  For a long time we all worked\nvery busily without speaking.  At length Peterkin looked up: \"I say,\nJack, I'm sorry to say I must apply to you for another strip of your\nhandkerchief, to tie on this rascally head with.  It's pretty well torn\nat any rate, so you won't miss it.\"\n\nJack proceeded to comply with this request when Peterkin suddenly laid\nhis hand on his arm and arrested him.\n\n\"Hist, man,\" said he, \"be tender; you should never be needlessly cruel if\nyou can help it.  Do try to shave past Lord Nelson's mouth without\ntearing it, if possible!  Thanks.  There are plenty more handkerchiefs on\nthe cocoa-nut trees.\"\n\nPoor Peterkin! with what pleasant feelings I recall and record his jests\nand humorous sayings now!\n\nWhile we were thus engaged, we were startled by a distant but most\nstrange and horrible cry.  It seemed to come from the sea, but was so far\naway that we could not clearly distinguish its precise direction.  Rushing\nout of our bower, we hastened down to the beach and stayed to listen.\nAgain it came quite loud and distinct on the night air,--a prolonged,\nhideous cry, something like the braying of an ass.  The moon had risen,\nand we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon quite plainly, but\nthere was no object visible to account for such a cry.  A strong gust of\nwind was blowing from the point whence the sound came, but this died away\nwhile we were gazing out to sea.\n\n\"What can it be?\" said Peterkin, in a low whisper, while we all\ninvoluntarily crept closer to each other.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Jack, \"I have heard that mysterious sound twice\nbefore, but never so loud as to-night.  Indeed it was so faint that I\nthought I must have merely fancied it, so, as I did not wish to alarm\nyou, I said nothing about it.\"\n\nWe listened for a long time for the sound again, but as it did not come,\nwe returned to the bower and resumed our work.\n\n\"Very strange,\" said Peterkin, quite gravely.  \"Do you believe in ghosts,\nRalph?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"I do not.  Nevertheless I must confess that strange,\nunaccountable sounds, such as we have just heard, make me feel a little\nuneasy.\"\n\n\"What say you to it, Jack?\"\n\n\"I neither believe in ghosts nor feel uneasy,\" he replied.  \"I never saw\na ghost myself, and I never met with any one who had; and I have\ngenerally found that strange and unaccountable things have almost always\nbeen accounted for, and found to be quite simple, on close examination.  I\ncertainly can't imagine what _that_ sound is; but I'm quite sure I shall\nfind out before long,--and if it's a ghost I'll--\"\n\n\"Eat it,\" cried Peterkin.\n\n\"Yes, I'll eat it!  Now, then, my bow and two arrows are finished; so if\nyou're ready we had better turn in.\"\n\nBy this time Peterkin had thinned down his spear and tied an iron point\nvery cleverly to the end of it; I had formed a sling, the lines of which\nwere composed of thin strips of the cocoa-nut cloth, plaited; and Jack\nhad made a stout bow, nearly five feet long, with two arrows, feathered\nwith two or three large plumes which some bird had dropt.  They had no\nbarbs, but Jack said that if arrows were well feathered, they did not\nrequire iron points, but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the\npoint; which I did not know before.\n\n\"A feathered arrow without a barb,\" said he, \"is a good weapon, but a\nbarbed arrow without feathers is utterly useless.\"\n\nThe string of the bow was formed of our piece of whip-cord, part of\nwhich, as he did not like to cut it, was rolled round the bow.\n\nAlthough thus prepared for a start on the morrow, we thought it wise to\nexercise ourselves a little in the use of our weapons before starting, so\nwe spent the whole of the next day in practising.  And it was well we did\nso, for we found that our arms were very imperfect, and that we were far\nfrom perfect in the use of them.  First, Jack found that the bow was much\ntoo strong, and he had to thin it.  Also the spear was much too heavy,\nand so had to be reduced in thickness, although nothing would induce\nPeterkin to have it shortened.  My sling answered very well, but I had\nfallen so much out of practice that my first stone knocked off Peterkin's\nhat, and narrowly missed making a second Goliath of him.  However, after\nhaving spent the whole day in diligent practice, we began to find some of\nour former expertness returning--at least Jack and I did.  As for\nPeterkin, being naturally a neat-handed boy, he soon handled his spear\nwell, and could run full tilt at a cocoa nut, and hit it with great\nprecision once out of every five times.\n\nBut I feel satisfied that we owed much of our rapid success to the\nunflagging energy of Jack, who insisted that, since we had made him\nCaptain, we should obey him; and he kept us at work from morning till\nnight, perseveringly, at the same thing.  Peterkin wished very much to\nrun about and stick his spear into everything he passed; but Jack put up\na cocoa nut, and would not let him leave off running at that for a\nmoment, except when he wanted to rest.  We laughed at Jack for this, but\nwe were both convinced that it did us much good.\n\nThat night we examined and repaired our arms ere we lay down to rest,\nalthough we were much fatigued, in order that we might be in readiness to\nset out on our expedition at daylight on the following morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nPrepare for a journey round the island--Sagacious reflections--Mysterious\nappearances and startling occurrences.\n\nScarcely had the sun shot its first ray across the bosom of the broad\nPacific, when Jack sprang to his feet, and, hallooing in Peterkin's ear\nto awaken him, ran down the beach to take his customary dip in the sea.\nWe did not, as was our wont, bathe that morning in our Water Garden, but,\nin order to save time, refreshed ourselves in the shallow water just\nopposite the bower.  Our breakfast was also despatched without loss of\ntime, and in less than an hour afterwards all our preparations for the\njourney were completed.\n\nIn addition to his ordinary dress, Jack tied a belt of cocoa-nut cloth\nround his waist, into which he thrust the axe.  I was also advised to put\non a belt and carry a short cudgel or bludgeon in it; for, as Jack truly\nremarked, the sling would be of little use if we should chance to come to\nclose quarters with any wild animal.  As for Peterkin, notwithstanding\nthat he carried such a long, and I must add, frightful-looking spear over\nhis shoulder, we could not prevail on him to leave his club behind;\n\"for,\" said he, \"a spear at close quarters is not worth a button.\"  I\nmust say that it seemed to me that the club was, to use his own style of\nlanguage, not worth a button-hole; for it was all knotted over at the\nhead, something like the club which I remember to have observed in\npicture-books of Jack the Giant Killer, besides being so heavy that he\nrequired to grasp it with both hands in order to wield it at all.\nHowever, he took it with him, and, in this manner we set out upon our\ntravels.\n\nWe did not consider it necessary to carry any food with us, as we knew\nthat wherever we went we should be certain to fall in with cocoa-nut\ntrees; having which, we were amply supplied, as Peterkin said, with meat\nand drink and pocket-handkerchiefs!  I took the precaution, however, to\nput the burning-glass into my pocket, lest we should want fire.\n\nThe morning was exceeding lovely.  It was one of that very still and\npeaceful sort which made the few noises that we heard seem to be _quiet_\nnoises.  I know no other way of expressing this idea.  Noises which so\nfar from interrupting the universal tranquillity of earth, sea, and\nsky--rather tended to reveal to us how quiet the world around us really\nwas.  Such sounds as I refer to were, the peculiarly melancholy--yet, it\nseemed to me, cheerful--plaint of sea-birds floating on the glassy water,\nor sailing in the sky, also the subdued twittering of little birds among\nthe bushes, the faint ripples on the beach, and the solemn boom of the\nsurf upon the distant coral reef.  We felt very glad in our hearts as we\nwalked along the sands side by side.  For my part, I felt so deeply\noverjoyed, that I was surprised at my own sensations, and fell into a\nreverie upon the causes of happiness.  I came to the conclusion that a\nstate of profound peace and repose, both in regard to outward objects and\nwithin the soul, is the happiest condition in which man can be placed;\nfor, although I had many a time been most joyful and happy when engaged\nin bustling, energetic, active pursuits or amusements, I never found that\nsuch joy or satisfaction was so deep or so pleasant to reflect upon as\nthat which I now experienced.  And I was the more confirmed in this\nopinion when I observed, and, indeed, was told by himself, that\nPeterkin's happiness was also very great; yet he did not express this by\ndancing, as was his wont, nor did he give so much as a single shout, but\nwalked quietly between us with his eye sparkling, and a joyful smile upon\nhis countenance.  My reader must not suppose that I thought all this in\nthe clear and methodical manner in which I have set it down here.  These\nthoughts did, indeed, pass through my mind, but they did so in a very\nconfused and indefinite manner, for I was young at that time, and not\nmuch given to deep reflections.  Neither did I consider that the peace\nwhereof I write is not to be found in this world--at least in its\nperfection, although I have since learned that by religion a man may\nattain to a very great degree of it.\n\nI have said that Peterkin walked along the sands between us.  We had two\nways of walking together about our island.  When we travelled through the\nwoods, we always did so in single file, as by this method we advanced\nwith greater facility, the one treading in the other's footsteps.  In\nsuch cases Jack always took the lead, Peterkin followed, and I brought up\nthe rear.  But when we travelled along the sands, which extended almost\nin an unbroken line of glistening white round the island, we marched\nabreast, as we found this method more sociable, and every way more\npleasant.  Jack, being the tallest, walked next the sea, and Peterkin\nmarched between us, as by this arrangement either of us could talk to him\nor he to us, while if Jack and I happened to wish to converse together,\nwe could conveniently do so over Peterkin's head.  Peterkin used to say,\nin reference to this arrangement, that had he been as tall as either of\nus, our order of march might have been the same, for, as Jack often used\nto scold him for letting everything we said to him pass in at one ear and\nout at the other, his head could of course form no interruption to our\ndiscourse.\n\nWe were now fairly started.  Half a mile's walk conveyed us round a bend\nin the land which shut out our bower from view, and for some time we\nadvanced at a brisk pace without speaking, though our eyes were not idle,\nbut noted everything, in the woods, on the shore, or in the sea, that was\ninteresting.  After passing the ridge of land that formed one side of our\nvalley--the Valley of the Wreck--we beheld another small vale lying\nbefore us in all the luxuriant loveliness of tropical vegetation.  We\nhad, indeed, seen it before from the mountain-top, but we had no idea\nthat it would turn out to be so much more lovely when we were close to\nit.  We were about to commence the exploration of this valley, when\nPeterkin stopped us, and directed our attention to a very remarkable\nappearance in advance along the shore.\n\n\"What's yon, think you?\" said he, levelling his spear, as if he expected\nan immediate attack from the object in question, though it was full half\na mile distant.\n\nAs he spoke, there appeared a white column above the rocks, as if of\nsteam or spray.  It rose upwards to a height of several feet, and then\ndisappeared.  Had this been near the sea, we would not have been so\ngreatly surprised, as it might in that case have been the surf, for at\nthis part of the coast the coral reef approached so near to the island\nthat in some parts it almost joined it.  There was therefore no lagoon\nbetween, and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the rocks.  But\nthis white column appeared about fifty yards inland.  The rocks at the\nplace were rugged, and they stretched across the sandy beach into the\nsea.  Scarce had we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight, when\nanother column flew upwards for a few seconds, not far from the spot\nwhere the first had been seen, and disappeared; and so, at long irregular\nintervals, these strange sights recurred.  We were now quite sure that\nthe columns were watery or composed of spray, but what caused them we\ncould not guess, so we determined to go and see.\n\nIn a few minutes we gained the spot, which was very rugged and\nprecipitous, and, moreover, quite damp with the falling of the spray.  We\nhad much ado to pass over dry-shod.  The ground also was full of holes\nhere and there.  Now, while we stood anxiously waiting for the\nre-appearance of these water-spouts, we heard a low, rumbling sound near\nus, which quickly increased to a gargling and hissing noise, and a moment\nafterwards a thick spout of water burst upwards from a hole in the rock,\nand spouted into the air with much violence, and so close to where Jack\nand I were standing that it nearly touched us.  We sprang to one side,\nbut not before a cloud of spray descended, and drenched us both to the\nskin.\n\nPeterkin, who was standing farther off, escaped with a few drops, and\nburst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter on beholding our miserable\nplight.\n\n\"Mind your eye!\" he shouted eagerly, \"there goes another!\"  The words\nwere scarcely out of his mouth when there came up a spout from another\nhole, which served us exactly in the same manner as before.\n\nPeterkin now shrieked with laughter; but his merriment was abruptly put a\nstop to by the gurgling noise occurring close to where he stood.\n\n\"Where'll it spout this time, I wonder?\" he said, looking about with some\nanxiety, and preparing to run.  Suddenly there came a loud hiss or snort;\na fierce spout of water burst up between Peterkin's legs, blew him off\nhis feet, enveloped him in its spray, and hurled him to the ground.  He\nfell with so much violence that we feared he must have broken some of his\nbones, and ran anxiously to his assistance; but fortunately he had fallen\non a clump of tangled herbage, in which he lay sprawling in a most\ndeplorable condition.\n\nIt was now our turn to laugh; but as we were not yet quite sure that he\nwas unhurt, and as we knew not when or where the next spout might arise,\nwe assisted him hastily to jump up and hurry from the spot.\n\nI may here add, that although I am quite certain that the spout of water\nwas very strong, and that it blew Peterkin completely off his legs, I am\nnot quite certain of the exact height to which it lifted him, being\nsomewhat startled by the event, and blinded partially by the spray, so\nthat my power of observation was somewhat impaired for the moment.\n\n\"What's to be done now?\" inquired Peterkin ruefully.\n\n\"Make a fire, lad, and dry ourselves,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"And here is material ready to our hand,\" said I, picking up a dried\nbranch of a tree, as we hurried up to the woods.\n\nIn about an hour after this mishap our clothes were again dried.  While\nthey were hanging up before the fire, we walked down to the beach, and\nsoon observed that these curious spouts took place immediately after the\nfall of a huge wave, never before it; and, moreover, that the spouts did\nnot take place excepting when the billow was an extremely large one.  From\nthis we concluded that there must be a subterraneous channel in the rock\ninto which the water was driven by the larger waves, and finding no way\nof escape except through these small holes, was thus forced up violently\nthrough them.  At any rate, we could not conceive any other reason for\nthese strange water-spouts, and as this seemed a very simple and probable\none, we forthwith adopted it.\n\n\"I say, Ralph, what's that in the water? is it a shark?\" said Jack, just\nas we were about to quit the place.\n\nI immediately ran to the overhanging ledge of rock, from which he was\nlooking down into the sea, and bent over it.  There I saw a very faint\npale object of a greenish colour, which seemed to move slightly while I\nlooked at it.\n\n\"It's like a fish of some sort,\" said I.\n\n\"Hallo, Peterkin!\" cried Jack, \"fetch your spear; here's work for it.\"\n\nBut when we tried to reach the object, the spear proved to be too short.\n\n\"There, now,\" said Peterkin with a sneer, \"you were always telling me it\nwas too long.\"\n\nJack now drove the spear forcibly towards the object, and let go his\nhold; but, although it seemed to be well aimed, he must have missed, for\nthe handle soon rose again; and when the spear was drawn up, there was\nthe pale green object in exactly the same spot, slowly moving its tail.\n\n\"Very odd,\" said Jack.\n\nBut although it was undoubtedly very odd, and, although Jack and all of\nus plunged the spear at it repeatedly, we could neither hit it nor drive\nit away, so we were compelled to continue our journey without discovering\nwhat it was.  I was very much perplexed at this strange appearance in the\nwater, and could not get it out of my mind for a long time afterwards.\nHowever, I quieted myself by resolving that I would pay a visit to it\nagain at some more convenient season.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nMake discovery of many excellent roots and fruits--The resources of the\nCoral Island gradually unfolded--The banian-tree--Another tree which is\nsupported by natural planks--Water-fowl found--A very remarkable\ndiscovery, and a very peculiar murder--We luxuriate on the fat of the\nland.\n\nOur examination of the little valley proved to be altogether most\nsatisfactory.  We found in it not only similar trees to those we had\nalready seen in our own valley, but also one or two others of a different\nspecies.  We had also the satisfaction of discovering a peculiar\nvegetable, which Jack concluded must certainly be that of which he had\nread as being very common among the South Sea islanders, and which was\nnamed _taro_.  Also we found a large supply of yams, and another root\nlike a potato in appearance.  As these were all quite new to us, we\nregarded our lot as a most fortunate one, in being thus cast on an island\nwhich was so prolific and so well stored with all the necessaries of\nlife.  Long afterwards we found out that this island of ours was no\nbetter in these respects than thousands of other islands in those seas.\nIndeed, many of them were much richer and more productive; but that did\nnot render us the less grateful for our present good fortune.  We each\nput one of these roots in our pocket, intending to use them for our\nsupper; of which more hereafter.  We also saw many beautiful birds here,\nand traces of some four-footed animal again.  Meanwhile the sun began to\ndescend, so we returned to the shore, and pushed on round the spouting\nrocks into the next valley.  This was that valley of which I have spoken\nas running across the entire island.  It was by far the largest and most\nbeautiful that we had yet looked upon.  Here were trees of every shape\nand size and hue which it is possible to conceive of, many of which we\nhad not seen in the other valleys; for, the stream in this valley being\nlarger, and the mould much richer than in the Valley of the Wreck, it was\nclothed with a more luxuriant growth of trees and plants.  Some trees\nwere dark glossy green, others of a rich and warm hue, contrasting well\nwith those of a pale light green, which were everywhere abundant.  Among\nthese we recognised the broad dark heads of the bread-fruit, with its\ngolden fruit; the pure, silvery foliage of the candle-nut, and several\nspecies which bore a strong resemblance to the pine; while here and\nthere, in groups and in single trees, rose the tall forms of the cocoa-\nnut palms, spreading abroad, and waving their graceful plumes high above\nall the rest, as if they were a superior race of stately giants keeping\nguard over these luxuriant forests.  Oh! it was a most enchanting scene,\nand I thanked God for having created such delightful spots for the use of\nman.\n\nNow, while we were gazing around us in silent admiration, Jack uttered an\nexclamation of surprise, and, pointing to an object a little to one side\nof us, said,--\n\n\"That's a banian-tree.\"\n\n\"And what's a banian-tree?\" inquired Peterkin, as we walked towards it.\n\n\"A very curious one, as you shall see presently,\" replied Jack.  \"It is\ncalled the _aoa_ here, if I recollect rightly, and has a wonderful\npeculiarity about it.  What an enormous one it is, to be sure.\"\n\n\"_It_!\" repeated Peterkin; \"why, there are dozens of banians here!  What\ndo you mean by talking bad grammar?  Is your philosophy deserting you,\nJack?\"\n\n\"There is but one tree here of this kind,\" returned Jack, \"as you will\nperceive if you will examine it.\"  And, sure enough, we did find that\nwhat we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one.  Its\nbark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the leaves\nbeing lance-shaped, small, and of a beautiful pea-green.  But the\nwonderful thing about it was, that the branches, which grew out from the\nstem horizontally, sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground, which,\ntaking root, had themselves become trees, and were covered with bark like\nthe tree itself.  Many of these fibres had descended from the branches at\nvarious distances, and thus supported them on natural pillars, some of\nwhich were so large and strong, that it was not easy at first to\ndistinguish the offspring from the parent stem.  The fibres were of all\nsizes and in all states of advancement, from the pillars we have just\nmentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to take root, and\nthin brown threads still far from the ground, which swayed about with\nevery motion of wind.  In short, it seemed to us that, if there were only\nspace afforded to it, this single tree would at length cover the whole\nisland.\n\nShortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree, which, as its\npeculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful to us, merits\ndescription.  It was a splendid chestnut, but its proper name Jack did\nnot know.  However, there were quantities of fine nuts upon it, some of\nwhich we put in our pockets.  But its stem was the wonderful part of it.\nIt rose to about twelve feet without a branch, and was not of great\nthickness; on the contrary, it was remarkably slender for the size of the\ntree; but, to make up for this, there were four or five wonderful\nprojections in this stem, which I cannot better describe than by asking\nthe reader to suppose that five planks of two inches thick and three feet\nbroad had been placed round the trunk of the tree, with their _edges_\nclosely fixed to it, from the ground up to the branches, and that these\nplanks bad been covered over with the bark of the tree and incorporated\nwith it.  In short, they were just natural buttresses, without which the\nstem could not have supported its heavy and umbrageous top.  We found\nthese chestnuts to be very numerous.  They grew chiefly on the banks of\nthe stream, and were of all sizes.\n\nWhile we were examining a small tree of this kind, Jack chipped a piece\noff a buttress with his axe, and found the wood to be firm and easily\ncut.  He then struck the axe into it with all his force, and very soon\nsplit it off close to the tree, first, however, having cut it across\ntransversely above and below.  By this means he satisfied himself that we\ncould now obtain short planks, as it were all ready sawn, of any size and\nthickness that we desired; which was a very great discovery indeed,\nperhaps the most important we had yet made.\n\nWe now wended our way back to the coast, intending to encamp near the\nbeach, as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome in the forest.  On\nour way we could not help admiring the birds which flew and chirped\naround us.  Among them we observed a pretty kind of paroquet, with a\ngreen body, a blue head, and a red breast; also a few beautiful\nturtledoves, and several flocks of wood-pigeons.  The hues of many of\nthese birds were extremely vivid,--bright green, blue, and scarlet, being\nthe prevailing tints.  We made several attempts throughout the day to\nbring down one of these, both with the bow and the sling,--not for mere\nsport, but to ascertain whether they were good for food.  But we\ninvariably missed, although once or twice we were very near hitting.  As\nevening drew on, however, a flock of pigeons flew past.  I slung a stone\ninto the midst of them at a venture, and had the good fortune to kill\none.  We were startled, soon after, by a loud whistling noise above our\nheads; and on looking up, saw a flock of wild ducks making for the coast.\nWe watched these, and, observing where they alighted, followed them up\nuntil we came upon a most lovely blue lake, not more than two hundred\nyards long, imbosomed in verdant trees.  Its placid surface, which\nreflected every leaf and stem, as if in a mirror, was covered with\nvarious species of wild ducks, feeding among the sedges and broad-leaved\nwater-plants which floated on it, while numerous birds like water-hens\nran to and fro most busily on its margin.  These all with one accord flew\ntumultuously away the instant we made our appearance.  While walking\nalong the margin we observed fish in the water, but of what sort we could\nnot tell.\n\nNow, as we neared the shore, Jack and I said we would go a little out of\nour way to see if we could procure one of those ducks; so, directing\nPeterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire, we separated,\npromising to rejoin him speedily.  But we did not find the ducks,\nalthough we made a diligent search for half an hour.  We were about to\nretrace our steps, when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights\nthat we had yet beheld.\n\nJust in front of us, at the distance of about ten yards, grew a superb\ntree, which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on the island.  Its\ntrunk was at least five feet in diameter, with a smooth gray bark; above\nthis the spreading branches were clothed with light green leaves, amid\nwhich were clusters of bright yellow fruit, so numerous as to weigh down\nthe boughs with their great weight.  This fruit seemed to be of the plum\nspecies, of an oblong form, and a good deal larger than the magnum bonum\nplum.  The ground at the foot of this tree was thickly strewn with the\nfallen fruit, in the midst of which lay sleeping, in every possible\nattitude, at least twenty hogs of all ages and sizes, apparently quite\nsurfeited with a recent banquet.\n\nJack and I could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at these\ncoarse, fat, ill-looking animals, while they lay groaning and snoring\nheavily amid the remains of their supper.\n\n\"Now, Ralph,\" said Jack, in a low whisper, \"put a stone in your sling,--a\ngood big one,--and let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you.\nI'll try to put an arrow into yon little pig.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we had better put them up first?\" I whispered; \"it seems\ncruel to kill them while asleep.\"\n\n\"If I wanted _sport_, Ralph, I would certainly set them up; but as we\nonly want _pork_, we'll let them lie.  Besides, we're not sure of killing\nthem; so, fire away.\"\n\nThus admonished, I slung my stone with so good aim that it went bang\nagainst the hog's flank as if against the head of a drum; but it had no\nother effect than that of causing the animal to start to its feet, with a\nfrightful yell of surprise, and scamper away.  At the same instant Jack's\nbow twanged, and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by the\near.\n\n\"I've missed, after all,\" cried Jack, darting forward with uplifted axe,\nwhile the little pig uttered a loud squeal, tore the arrow from the\nground, and ran away with it, along with the whole drove, into the bushes\nand disappeared, though we heard them screaming long afterwards in the\ndistance.\n\n\"That's very provoking, now,\" said Jack, rubbing the point of his nose.\n\n\"Very,\" I replied, stroking my chin.\n\n\"Well, we must make haste and rejoin Peterkin,\" said Jack.  \"It's getting\nlate.\"  And, without further remark, we threaded our way quickly through\nthe woods towards the shore.\n\nWhen we reached it, we found wood laid out, the fire lighted and\nbeginning to kindle up, with other signs of preparation for our\nencampment, but Peterkin was nowhere to be found.  We wondered very much\nat this; but Jack suggested that he might have gone to fetch water; so he\ngave a shout to let him know that we had arrived, and sat down upon a\nrock, while I threw off my jacket and seized the axe, intending to split\nup one or two billets of wood.  But I had scarce moved from the spot\nwhen, in the distance, we heard a most appalling shriek, which was\nfollowed up by a chorus of yells from the hogs, and a loud \"hurrah!\"\n\n\"I do believe,\" said I, \"that Peterkin has met with the hogs.\"\n\n\"When Greek meets Greek,\" said Jack, soliloquizing, \"then comes the tug\nof--\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Peterkin in the distance.\n\nWe turned hastily towards the direction whence the sound came, and soon\ndescried Peterkin walking along the beach towards us with a little pig\ntransfixed on the end of his long spear!\n\n\"Well done, my boy!\" exclaimed Jack, slapping him on the shoulder when he\ncame up, \"you're the best shot amongst us.\"\n\n\"Look here Jack!\" cried Peterkin, as he disengaged the animal from his\nspear.  \"Do you recognise that hole?\" said he, pointing to the pig's ear;\n\"and are you familiar with this arrow, eh?\"\n\n\"Well, I declare!\" said Jack.\n\n\"Of course you do,\" interrupted Peterkin; \"but, pray, restrain your\ndeclarations at this time, and let's have supper, for I'm uncommonly\nhungry, I can tell you; and it's no joke to charge a whole herd of swine\nwith their great-grandmother bristling like a giant porcupine at the head\nof them!\"\n\nWe now set about preparing supper; and, truly, a good display of viands\nwe made, when all was laid out on a flat rock in the light of the blazing\nfire.  There was, first of all, the little pig; then there was the taro-\nroot, and the yam, and the potato, and six plums; and, lastly, the wood-\npigeon.  To these Peterkin added a bit of sugar-cane, which he had cut\nfrom a little patch of that plant which he had found not long after\nseparating from us; \"and,\" said he, \"the patch was somewhat in a square\nform, which convinces me it must have been planted by man.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied Jack.  \"From all we have seen, I'm inclined to\nthink that some of the savages must have dwelt here long ago.\"\n\nWe found no small difficulty in making up our minds how we were to cook\nthe pig.  None of us had ever cut up one before, and we did not know\nexactly how to begin; besides, we had nothing but the axe to do it with,\nour knife having been forgotten.  At last Jack started up and said,--\n\n\"Don't let us waste more time talking about it, boys.  Hold it up,\nPeterkin.  There, lay the hind leg on this block of wood, so;\" and he cut\nit off, with a large portion of the haunch, at a single blow of the axe.\n\"Now the other,--that's it.\"  And having thus cut off the two hind legs,\nhe made several deep gashes in them, thrust a sharp-pointed stick through\neach, and stuck them up before the blaze to roast.  The wood-pigeon was\nthen split open, quite flat, washed clean in salt water, and treated in a\nsimilar manner.  While these were cooking, we scraped a hole in the sand\nand ashes under the fire, into which we put our vegetables, and covered\nthem up.\n\nThe taro-root was of an oval shape, about ten inches long and four or\nfive thick.  It was of a mottled-gray colour, and had a thick rind.  We\nfound it somewhat like an Irish potato, and exceedingly good.  The yam\nwas roundish, and had a rough brown skin.  It was very sweet and well-\nflavoured.  The potato, we were surprised to find, was quite sweet and\nexceedingly palatable, as also were the plums; and, indeed, the pork and\npigeon too, when we came to taste them.  Altogether this was decidedly\nthe most luxurious supper we had enjoyed for many a day; and Jack said it\nwas out-of-sight better than we ever got on board ship; and Peterkin said\nhe feared that if we should remain long on the island he would infallibly\nbecome a glutton or an epicure: whereat Jack remarked that he need not\nfear that, for he was _both_ already!  And so, having eaten our fill, not\nforgetting to finish off with a plum, we laid ourselves comfortably down\nto sleep upon a couch of branches under the overhanging ledge of a coral\nrock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nEffects of over-eating, and reflections thereon--Humble advice regarding\ncold water--The \"horrible cry\" accounted for--The curious birds called\npenguins--Peculiarity of the cocoa nut palm--Questions on the formation\nof coral islands--Mysterious footsteps--Strange discoveries and sad\nsights.\n\nWhen we awoke on the following morning, we found that the sun was already\na good way above the horizon, so I came to the conclusion that a heavy\nsupper is not conducive to early rising.  Nevertheless, we felt\nremarkably strong and well, and much disposed to have our breakfast.\nFirst, however, we had our customary morning bathe, which refreshed us\ngreatly.\n\nI have often wondered very much in after years that the inhabitants of my\nown dear land did not make more frequent use of this most charming\nelement, water.  I mean in the way of cold bathing.  Of course, I have\nperceived that it is not convenient for them to go into the sea or the\nrivers in winter, as we used to do on the Coral Island; but then, I knew\nfrom experience that a large washing-tub and a sponge do form a most\npleasant substitute.  The feelings of freshness, of cleanliness, of\nvigour, and extreme hilarity, that always followed my bathes in the sea,\nand even, when in England, my ablutions in the wash-tub, were so\ndelightful, that I would sooner have gone without my breakfast than\nwithout my bathe in cold water.  My readers will forgive me for asking\nwhether they are in the habit of bathing thus every morning; and if they\nanswer \"No,\" they will pardon me for recommending them to begin at once.\nOf late years, since retiring from the stirring life of adventure which I\nhave led so long in foreign climes, I have heard of a system called the\ncold-water-cure.  Now, I do not know much about that system, so I do not\nmean to uphold it, neither do I intend to run it down.  Perhaps, in\nreference to it, I may just hint that there may be too much of a good\nthing.  I know not; but of this I am quite certain, that there may also\nbe too little of a good thing; and the great delight I have had in cold\nbathing during the course of my adventurous career inclines me to think\nthat it is better to risk taking too much than to content one's self with\ntoo little.  Such is my opinion, derived from much experience; but I put\nit before my readers with the utmost diffidence and with profound\nmodesty, knowing that it may possibly jar with their feelings of\nconfidence in their own ability to know and judge as to what is best and\nfittest in reference to their own affairs.  But, to return from this\ndigression, for which I humbly crave forgiveness.\n\nWe had not advanced on our journey much above a mile or so, and were just\nbeginning to feel the pleasant glow that usually accompanies vigorous\nexercise, when, on turning a point that revealed to us a new and\nbeautiful cluster of islands, we were suddenly arrested by the appalling\ncry which had so alarmed us a few nights before.  But this time we were\nby no means so much alarmed as on the previous occasion, because, whereas\nat that time it was night, now it was day; and I have always found,\nthough I am unable to account for it, that daylight banishes many of the\nfears that are apt to assail us in the dark.\n\nOn hearing the sound, Peterkin instantly threw forward his spear.\n\n\"Now, what can it be?\" said he, looking round at Jack.  \"I tell you what\nit is, if we are to go on being pulled up in a constant state of horror\nand astonishment, as we have been for the last week, the sooner we're out\no' this island the better, notwithstanding the yams and lemonade, and\npork and plums!\"\n\nPeterkin's remark was followed by a repetition of the cry, louder than\nbefore.\n\n\"It comes from one of these islands,\" said Jack.\n\n\"It must be the ghost of a jackass, then,\" said Peterkin, \"for I never\nheard anything so like.\"\n\nWe all turned our eyes towards the cluster of islands, where, on the\nlargest, we observed curious objects moving on the shore.\n\n\"Soldiers they are,--that's flat!\" cried Peterkin, gazing at them in the\nutmost amazement.\n\nAnd, in truth, Peterkin's remark seemed to me to be correct; for, at the\ndistance from which we saw them, they appeared to be an army of soldiers.\nThere they stood, rank and file, in lines and in squares, marching and\ncountermarching, with blue coats and white trousers.  While we were\nlooking at them, the dreadful cry came again over the water, and Peterkin\nsuggested that it must be a regiment sent out to massacre the natives in\ncold blood.  At this remark Jack laughed and said,--\n\n\"Why, Peterkin, they are penguins!\"\n\n\"Penguins?\" repeated Peterkin.\n\n\"Ay, penguins, Peterkin, penguins,--nothing more or less than big sea-\nbirds, as you shall see one of these days, when we pay them a visit in\nour boat, which I mean to set about building the moment we return to our\nbower.\"\n\n\"So, then, our dreadful yelling ghosts and our murdering army of\nsoldiers,\" remarked Peterkin, \"have dwindled down to penguins,--big sea-\nbirds!  Very good.  Then I propose that we continue our journey as fast\nas possible, lest our island should be converted into a dream before we\nget completely round it.\"\n\nNow, as we continued on our way, I pondered much over this new discovery,\nand the singular appearance of these birds, of which Jack could only give\nus a very slight and vague account; and I began to long to commence to\nour boat, in order that we might go and inspect them more narrowly.  But\nby degrees these thoughts left me, and I began to be much taken up again\nwith the interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing\nthrough.\n\nThe second night we passed in a manner somewhat similar to the first, at\nabout two-thirds of the way round the island, as we calculated, and we\nhoped to sleep on the night following at our bower.  I will not here note\nso particularly all that we said and saw during the course of this second\nday, as we did not make any further discoveries of great importance.  The\nshore along which we travelled, and the various parts of the woods\nthrough which we passed, were similar to those which have been already\ntreated of.  There were one or two observations that we made, however,\nand these were as follows:--\n\nWe saw that, while many of the large fruit-bearing trees grew only in the\nvalleys, and some of them only near the banks of the streams, where the\nsoil was peculiarly rich, the cocoa-nut palm grew in every place\nwhatsoever,--not only on the hill sides, but also on the sea shore, and\neven, as has been already stated, on the coral reef itself, where the\nsoil, if we may use the name, was nothing better than loose sand mingled\nwith broken shells and coral rock.  So near to the sea, too, did this\nuseful tree grow, that in many places its roots were washed by the spray\nfrom the breakers.  Yet we found the trees growing thus on the sands to\nbe quite as luxuriant as those growing in the valleys, and the fruit as\ngood and refreshing also.  Besides this, I noticed that, on the summit of\nthe high mountain, which we once more ascended at a different point from\nour first ascent, were found abundance of shells and broken coral\nformations, which Jack and I agreed proved either that this island must\nhave once been under the sea, or that the sea must once have been above\nthe island.  In other words, that as shells and coral could not possibly\nclimb to the mountain top, they must have been washed upon it while the\nmountain top was on a level with the sea.  We pondered this very much;\nand we put to ourselves the question, \"What raised the island to its\npresent height above the sea?\"  But to this we could by no means give to\nourselves a satisfactory reply.  Jack thought it might have been blown up\nby a volcano; and Peterkin said he thought it must have jumped up of its\nown accord!  We also noticed, what had escaped us before, that the solid\nrocks of which the island was formed were quite different from the live\ncoral rocks on the shore, where the wonderful little insects were\ncontinually working.  They seemed, indeed, to be of the sauce material,--a\nsubstance like limestone; but, while the coral rocks were quite full of\nminute cells in which the insects lived, the other rocks inland were hard\nand solid, without the appearance of cells at all.  Our thoughts and\nconversations on this subject were sometimes so profound that Peterkin\nsaid we should certainly get drowned in them at last, even although we\nwere such good divers!  Nevertheless we did not allow his pleasantry on\nthis and similar points to deter us from making our notes and\nobservations as we went along.\n\nWe found several more droves of hogs in the woods, but abstained from\nkilling any of them, having more than sufficient for our present\nnecessities.  We saw also many of their foot-prints in this\nneighbourhood.  Among these we also observed the footprints of a smaller\nanimal, which we examined with much care, but could form no certain\nopinion as to them.  Peterkin thought they were those of a little dog,\nbut Jack and I thought differently.  We became very curious on this\nmatter, the more so that we observed these foot-prints to lie scattered\nabout in one locality, as if the animal which had made them was wandering\nround about in a very irregular manner, and without any object in view.\nEarly in the forenoon of our third day we observed these footprints to be\nmuch more numerous than ever, and in one particular spot they diverged\noff into the woods in a regular beaten track, which was, however, so\nclosely beset with bushes, that we pushed through it with difficulty.  We\nhad now become so anxious to find out what animal this was, and where it\nwent to, that we determined to follow the track, and, if possible, clear\nup the mystery.  Peterkin said, in a bantering tone, that he was sure it\nwould be cleared up as usual in some frightfully simple way, and prove to\nbe no mystery at all!\n\nThe beaten track seemed much too large to have been formed by the animal\nitself, and we concluded that some larger animal had made it, and that\nthe smaller one made use of it.  But everywhere the creeping plants and\ntangled bushes crossed our path, so that we forced our way along with\nsome difficulty.  Suddenly, as we came upon an open space, we heard a\nfaint cry, and observed a black animal standing in the track before us.\n\n\"A wild-cat!\" cried Jack, fitting an arrow to his bow, and discharging it\nso hastily that he missed the animal, and hit the earth about half a foot\nto one side of it.  To our surprise the wild-cat did not fly, but walked\nslowly towards the arrow, and snuffed at it.\n\n\"That's the most comical wild-cat I ever saw!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"It's a tame wild-cat, I think,\" said Peterkin, levelling his spear to\nmake a charge.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried I, laying my hand on his shoulder; \"I do believe the poor\nbeast is blind.  See, it strikes against the branches as it walks along.\nIt must be a very old one;\" and I hastened towards it.\n\n\"Only think,\" said Peterkin, with a suppressed laugh, \"of a superannuated\nwild-cat!\"\n\nWe now found that the poor cat was not only blind, or nearly so, but\nextremely deaf, as it did not hear our footsteps until we were quite\nclose behind it.  Then it sprang round, and, putting up its back and\ntail, while the black hair stood all on end, uttered a hoarse mew and a\nfuff.\n\n\"Poor thing,\" said Peterkin, gently extending his hand, and endeavouring\nto pat the cat's head.  \"Poor pussy; chee, chee, chee; puss, puss, puss;\ncheetie pussy!\"\n\nNo sooner did the cat hear these sounds than all signs of anger fled,\nand, advancing eagerly to Peterkin, it allowed itself to be stroked, and\nrubbed itself against his legs, purring loudly all the time, and showing\nevery symptom of the most extreme delight.\n\n\"It's no more a wild cat than I am!\" cried Peterkin, taking it in his\narms.  \"It's quite tame.  Poor pussy, cheetie pussy!\"\n\nWe now crowded around Peterkin, and were not a little surprised, and, to\nsay truth, a good deal affected, by the sight of the poor animal's\nexcessive joy.  It rubbed its head against Peterkin's cheek, licked his\nchin, and thrust its head almost violently into his neck, while it purred\nmore loudly than I ever heard a cat purr before, and appeared to be so\nmuch overpowered by its feelings, that it occasionally mewed and purred\nalmost in the same breath.  Such demonstrations of joy and affection led\nus at once to conclude that this poor cat must have known man before, and\nwe conjectured that it had been left either accidentally or by design on\nthe island many years ago, and was now evincing its extreme joy at\nmeeting once more with human beings.  While we were fondling the cat and\ntalking about it, Jack glanced round the open space in the midst of which\nwe stood.\n\n\"Hallo!\" exclaimed he; \"this looks something like a clearing.  The axe\nhas been at work here.  Just look at these tree-stumps.\"\n\nWe now turned to examine these, and, without doubt, we found trees that\nhad been cut down here and there, also stumps and broken branches; all of\nwhich, however, were completely covered over with moss, and bore evidence\nof having been in this condition for some years.  No human foot-prints\nwere to be seen, either on the track or among the bushes; but those of\nthe cat were found everywhere.  We now determined to follow up the track\nas far as it went, and Peterkin put the cat down; but it seemed to be so\nweak, and mewed so very pitifully, that he took it up again and carried\nit in his arms, where, in a few minutes, it fell sound asleep.\n\nAbout ten yards farther on, the felled trees became more numerous, and\nthe track, diverging to the right, followed for a short space the banks\nof a stream.  Suddenly we came to a spot where once must have been a rude\nbridge, the stones of which were scattered in the stream, and those on\neach bank entirely covered over with moss.  In silent surprise and\nexpectancy we continued to advance, and, a few yards farther on, beheld,\nunder the shelter of some bread-fruit trees, a small hut or cottage.  I\ncannot hope to convey to my readers a very correct idea of the feelings\nthat affected us on witnessing this unexpected sight.  We stood for a\nlong time in silent wonder, for there was a deep and most melancholy\nstillness about the place that quite overpowered us; and when we did at\nlength speak, it was in subdued whispers, as if we were surrounded by\nsome awful or supernatural influence.  Even Peterkin's voice, usually so\nquick and lively on all occasions, was hushed now; for there was a\ndreariness about this silent, lonely, uninhabited cottage,--so strange in\nits appearance, so far away from the usual dwellings of man, so old,\ndecayed, and deserted in its aspect,--that fell upon our spirits like a\nthick cloud, and blotted out as with a pall the cheerful sunshine that\nhad filled us since the commencement of our tour round the island.\n\nThe hut or cottage was rude and simple in its construction.  It was not\nmore than twelve feet long by ten feet broad, and about seven or eight\nfeet high.  It had one window, or rather a small frame in which a window\nmight, perhaps, once have been, but which was now empty.  The door was\nexceedingly low, and formed of rough boards, and the roof was covered\nwith broad cocoa-nut and plantain leaves.  But every part of it was in a\nstate of the utmost decay.  Moss and green matter grew in spots all over\nit.  The woodwork was quite perforated with holes; the roof had nearly\nfallen in, and appeared to be prevented from doing so altogether by the\nthick matting of creeping-plants and the interlaced branches which years\nof neglect had allowed to cover it almost entirely; while the thick,\nluxuriant branches of the bread-fruit and other trees spread above it,\nand flung a deep, sombre shadow over the spot, as if to guard it from the\nheat and the light of day.  We conversed long and in whispers about this\nstrange habitation ere we ventured to approach it; and when at length we\ndid so it was, at least on my part, with feelings of awe.\n\nAt first Jack endeavoured to peep in at the window, but from the deep\nshadow of the trees already mentioned, and the gloom within, he could not\nclearly discern objects; so we lifted the latch and pushed open the door.\nWe observed that the latch was made of iron, and almost eaten away with\nrust.  In the like condition were also the hinges, which creaked as the\ndoor swung back.  On entering, we stood still and gazed around us, while\nwe were much impressed with the dreary stillness of the room.  But what\nwe saw there surprised and shocked us not a little.  There was no\nfurniture in the apartment save a little wooden stool and an iron pot,\nthe latter almost eaten through with rust.  In the corner farthest from\nthe door was a low bedstead, on which lay two skeletons, imbedded in a\nlittle heap of dry dust.  With beating hearts we went forward to examine\nthem.  One was the skeleton of a man, the other that of a dog, which was\nextended close beside that of the man, with its head resting on his bosom\n\nNow we were very much concerned about this discovery, and could scarce\nrefrain from tears on beholding these sad remains.  After some time, we\nbegan to talk about what we had seen, and to examine in and around the\nhut, in order to discover some clue to the name or history of this poor\nman, who had thus died in solitude, with none to mourn his loss save his\ncat and his faithful dog.  But we found nothing,--neither a book nor a\nscrap of paper.  We found, however, the decayed remnants of what appeared\nto have been clothing, and an old axe.  But none of these things bore\nmarks of any kind; and, indeed, they were so much decayed as to convince\nus that they had lain in the condition in which we found them for many\nyears.\n\nThis discovery now accounted to us for the tree stump at the top of the\nmountain with the initials cut on it; also for the patch of sugar-cane\nand other traces of man which we had met with in the course of our\nrambles over the island.  And we were much saddened by the reflection\nthat the lot of this poor wanderer might possibly be our own, after many\nyears' residence on the island, unless we should be rescued by the visit\nof some vessel or the arrival of natives.  Having no clue whatever to\naccount for the presence of this poor human being in such a lonely spot,\nwe fell to conjecturing what could have brought him there.  I was\ninclined to think that he must have been a shipwrecked sailor, whose\nvessel had been lost here, and all the crew been drowned except himself\nand his dog and cat.  But Jack thought it more likely that he had run\naway from his vessel, and had taken the dog and cat to keep him company.\nWe were also much occupied in our minds with the wonderful difference\nbetween the cat and the dog.  For here we saw that while the one\nperished, like a loving friend, by its master's side, with its head\nresting on his bosom, the other had sought to sustain itself by prowling\nabroad in the forest, and had lived in solitude to a good old age.\nHowever, we did not conclude from this that the cat was destitute of\naffection, for we could not forget its emotions on first meeting with us;\nbut we saw from this, that the dog had a great deal more of generous love\nin its nature than the cat, because it not only found it impossible to\nlive after the death of its master, but it must needs, when it came to\ndie, crawl to his side and rest its head upon his lifeless breast.\n\nWhile we were thinking on these things, and examining into everything\nabout the room, we were attracted by an exclamation from Peterkin.\n\n\"I say, Jack,\" said he, \"here is something that will be of use to us.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Jack, hastening across the room.\n\n\"An old pistol,\" replied Peterkin, holding up the weapon, which he had\njust pulled from under a heap of broken wood and rubbish that lay in a\ncorner.\n\n\"That, indeed, might have been useful,\" said Jack, examining it, \"if we\nhad any powder; but I suspect the bow and the sling will prove more\nserviceable.\"\n\n\"True, I forgot that,\" said Peterkin; \"but we may as well take it with\nus, for the flint will serve to strike fire with when the sun does not\nshine.\"\n\n{A saddening discovery: p136.jpg}\n\nAfter having spent more than an hour at this place without discovering\nanything of further interest, Peterkin took up the old cat, which had\nlain very contentedly asleep on the stool whereon he had placed it, and\nwe prepared to take our departure.  In leaving the hut, Jack stumbled\nheavily against the door-post, which was so much decayed as to break\nacross, and the whole fabric of the hut seemed ready to tumble about our\nears.  This put into our heads that we might as well pull it down, and so\nform a mound over the skeleton.  Jack, therefore, with his axe, cut down\nthe other door-post, which, when it was done, brought the whole hut in\nruins to the ground, and thus formed a grave to the bones of the poor\nrecluse and his dog.  Then we left the spot, having brought away the iron\npot, the pistol, and the old axe, as they might be of much use to us\nhereafter.\n\nDuring the rest of this day we pursued our journey, and examined the\nother end of the large valley, which we found to be so much alike to the\nparts already described, that I shall not recount the particulars of what\nwe saw in this place.  I may, however, remark, that we did not quite\nrecover our former cheerful spirits until we arrived at our bower, which\nwe did late in the evening, and found everything just in the same\ncondition as we had left it three days before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nSomething wrong with the tank--Jack's wisdom and Peterkin's\nimpertinence--Wonderful behaviour of a crab--Good wishes for those who\ndwell far from the sea--Jack commences to build a little boat.\n\nRest is sweet as well for the body as for the mind.  During my long\nexperience, amid the vicissitudes of a chequered life, I have found that\nperiods of profound rest at certain intervals, in addition to the\nordinary hours of repose, are necessary to the wellbeing of man.  And the\nnature as well as the period of this rest varies, according to the\ndifferent temperaments of individuals, and the peculiar circumstances in\nwhich they may chance to be placed.  To those who work with their minds,\nbodily labour is rest.  To those who labour with the body, deep sleep is\nrest.  To the downcast, the weary, and the sorrowful, joy and peace are\nrest.  Nay, further, I think that to the gay, the frivolous, the\nreckless, when sated with pleasures that cannot last, even sorrow proves\nto be rest of a kind, although, perchance, it were better that I should\ncall it relief than rest.  There is, indeed, but one class of men to whom\nrest is denied.  There is no rest to the wicked.  At this I do but hint,\nhowever, as I treat not of that rest which is spiritual, but, more\nparticularly, of that which applies to the mind and to the body.\n\nOf this rest we stood much in need on our return home, and we found it\nexceedingly sweet, when we indulged in it, after completing the journey\njust related.  It had not, indeed, been a very long journey, nevertheless\nwe had pursued it so diligently that our frames were not a little\nprostrated.  Our minds were also very much exhausted in consequence of\nthe many surprises, frequent alarms, and much profound thought, to which\nthey had been subjected; so that when we lay down on the night of our\nreturn under the shelter of the bower, we fell immediately into very deep\nrepose.  I can state this with much certainty, for Jack afterwards\nadmitted the fact, and Peterkin, although he stoutly denied it, I heard\nsnoring loudly at least two minutes after lying down.  In this condition\nwe remained all night and the whole of the following day without awaking\nonce, or so much as moving our positions.  When we did awake it was near\nsunset, and we were all in such a state of lassitude that we merely rose\nto swallow a mouthful of food.  As Peterkin remarked, in the midst of a\nyawn, we took breakfast at tea-time, and then went to bed again, where we\nlay till the following forenoon.\n\nAfter this we arose very greatly refreshed, but much alarmed lest we had\nlost count of a day.  I say we were much alarmed on this head, for we had\ncarefully kept count of the days since we were cast upon our island, in\norder that we might remember the Sabbath-day, which day we had hitherto\nwith one accord kept as a day of rest, and refrained from all work\nwhatsoever.  However, on considering the subject, we all three\nentertained the same opinion as to how long we had slept, and so our\nminds were put at ease.\n\nWe now hastened to our Water Garden to enjoy a bathe, and to see how did\nthe animals which I had placed in the tank.  We found the garden more\ncharming, pelucid, and inviting than ever, and Jack and I plunged into\nits depth, and gambolled among its radiant coral groves; while Peterkin\nwallowed at the surface, and tried occasionally to kick us as we passed\nbelow.  Having dressed, I then hastened to the tank; but what was my\nsurprise and grief to find nearly all the animals dead, and the water in\na putrid condition!  I was greatly distressed at this, and wondered what\ncould be the cause of it.\n\n\"Why, you precious humbug,\" said Peterkin, coming up to me, \"how could\nyou expect it to be otherwise?  When fishes are accustomed to live in the\nPacific Ocean, how can you expect them to exist in a hole like that?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Peterkin,\" I replied, \"there seems to be truth in what you say.\nNevertheless, now I think of it, there must be some error in your\nreasoning; for, if I put in but a few very small animals, they will bear\nthe same proportion to this pond that the millions of fish bear to the\nocean.\"\n\n\"I say, Jack,\" cried Peterkin, waving his hand, \"come here, like a good\nfellow.  Ralph is actually talking philosophy.  Do come to our\nassistance, for he's out o' sight beyond me already!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Jack, coming up, while he endeavoured to\nscrub his long hair dry with a towel of cocoa-nut cloth.\n\nI repeated my thoughts to Jack, who, I was happy to find, quite agreed\nwith me.  \"Your best plan,\" he said, \"will be to put very few animals at\nfirst into your tank, and add more as you find it will bear them.  And\nlook here,\" he added, pointing to the sides of the tank, which, for the\nspace of two inches above the water-level, were incrusted with salt, \"you\nmust carry your philosophy a little farther, Ralph.  That water has\nevaporated so much that it is too salt for anything to live in.  You will\nrequire to add _fresh_ water now and then, in order to keep it at the\nsame degree of saltness as the sea.\"\n\n\"Very true, Jack, that never struck me before,\" said I.\n\n\"And, now I think of it,\" continued Jack, \"it seems to me that the surest\nway of arranging your tank so as to get it to keep pure and in good\ncondition, will be to imitate the ocean in it.  In fact make it a\nminiature Pacific.  I don't see how you can hope to succeed unless you do\nthat.\"\n\n\"Most true,\" said I, pondering what my companion said.  \"But I fear that\nthat will be very difficult.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" cried Jack, rolling his towel up into a ball, and throwing\nit into the face of Peterkin, who had been grinning and winking at him\nduring the last five minutes.  \"Not at all.  Look here.  There is water\nof a certain saltness in the sea; well, fill your tank with sea water,\nand keep it at that saltness by marking the height at which the water\nstands on the sides.  When it evaporates a little, pour in _fresh_ water\nfrom the brook till it comes up to the mark, and then it will be right,\nfor the salt does not evaporate with the water.  Then, there's lots of\nsea-weed in the sea;--well, go and get one or two bits of sea-weed, and\nput them into your tank.  Of course the weed must be alive, and growing\nto little stones; or you can chip a bit off the rocks with the weed\nsticking to it.  Then, if you like, you can throw a little sand and\ngravel into your tank, and the thing's complete.\"\n\n\"Nay, not quite,\" said Peterkin, who had been gravely attentive to this\noff-hand advice, \"not quite; you must first make three little men to dive\nin it before it can be said to be perfect, and that would be rather\ndifficult, I fear, for two of them would require to be philosophers.  But\nhallo! what's this?  I say, Ralph, look here.  There's one o' your crabs\nup to something uncommon.  It's performing the most remarkable operation\nfor a crab I ever saw,--taking off its coat, I do believe, before going\nto bed!\"\n\nWe hastily stooped over the tank, and certainly were not a little amused\nat the conduct of one of the crabs which still survived it companions.  It\nwas one of the common small crabs, like to those that are found running\nabout everywhere on the coasts of England.  While we gazed at it, we\nobserved its back to split away from the lower part of its body, and out\nof the gap thus formed came a soft lump which moved and writhed\nunceasingly.  This lump continued to increase in size until it appeared\nlike a bunch of crab's legs: and, indeed, such it proved in a very few\nminutes to be; for the points of the toes were at length extricated from\nthis hole in its back, the legs spread out, the body followed, and the\ncrab walked away quite entire, even to the points of its nipper-claws,\nleaving a perfectly entire shell behind it, so that, when we looked, it\nseemed as though there were two complete crabs instead of one!\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Peterkin, drawing a long breath, \"I've _heard_ of a man\njumping out of his skin and sitting down in his skeleton in order to cool\nhimself, but I never expected to _see_ a crab do it!\"\n\nWe were, in truth, much amazed at this spectacle, and the more so when we\nobserved that the new crab was larger than the crab that it came out of.\nIt was also quite soft, but by next morning its skin had hardened into a\ngood shell.  We came thus to know that crabs grow in this way, and not by\nthe growing of their shells, as we had always thought before we saw this\nwonderful operation.\n\nNow I considered well the advice which Jack had given me about preparing\nmy tank, and the more I thought of it, the more I came to regard it as\nvery sound and worthy of being acted on.  So I forthwith put his plan in\nexecution, and found it to answer excellently well, indeed much beyond my\nexpectation; for I found that after a little experience had taught me the\nproper proportion of sea-weed and animals to put into a certain amount of\nwater, the tank needed no farther attendance; and, moreover, I did not\nrequire ever afterwards to renew or change the sea-water, but only to add\na very little fresh water from the brook, now and then, as the other\nevaporated.  I therefore concluded that if I had been suddenly conveyed,\nalong with my tank, into some region where there was no salt sea at all,\nmy little sea and my sea-fish would have continued to thrive and to\nprosper notwithstanding.  This made me greatly to desire that those\npeople in the world who live far inland might know of my wonderful tank,\nand, by having materials like to those of which it was made conveyed to\nthem, thus be enabled to watch the habits of those most mysterious\nanimals that reside in the sea, and examine with their own eyes the\nwonders of the great deep.\n\nFor many days after this, while Peterkin and Jack were busily employed in\nbuilding a little boat out of the curious natural planks of the chestnut\ntree, I spent much of my time in examining with the burning-glass the\nmarvellous operations that were constantly going on in my tank.  Here I\nsaw those anemones which cling, like little red, yellow, and green blobs\nof jelly, to the rocks, put forth, as it were, a multitude of arms and\nwait till little fish or other small animalcules unwarily touched them,\nwhen they would instantly seize them, fold arm after arm around their\nvictims, and so engulf them in their stomachs.  Here I saw the ceaseless\nworking of those little coral insects whose efforts have encrusted the\nislands of the Pacific with vast rocks, and surrounded them with enormous\nreefs.  And I observed that many of these insects, though extremely\nminute, were very beautiful, coming out of their holes in a circle of\nfine threads, and having the form of a shuttle-cock.  Here I saw curious\nlittle barnacles opening a hole in their backs and constantly putting out\na thin feathery hand, with which, I doubt not, they dragged their food\ninto their mouths.  Here, also, I saw those crabs which have shells only\non the front of their bodies, but no shell whatever on their remarkably\ntender tails, so that, in order to find a protection to them, they thrust\nthem into the empty shells of wilks, or some such fish, and when they\ngrow too big for one, change into another.  But, most curious of all, I\nsaw an animal which had the wonderful power, when it became ill, of\ncasting its stomach and its teeth away from it, and getting an entirely\nnew set in the course of a few months!  All this I saw, and a great deal\nmore, by means of my tank and my burning-glass, but I refrain from\nsetting down more particulars here, as I have still much to tell of the\nadventures that befell us while we remained on this island.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nNotable discovery at the spouting cliffs--The mysterious green monster\nexplained--We are thrown into unutterable terror by the idea that Jack is\ndrowned--The Diamond Cave.\n\n\"Come, Jack,\" cried Peterkin, one morning about three weeks after our\nreturn from our long excursion, \"let's be jolly to-day, and do something\nvigorous.  I'm quite tired of hammering and hammering, hewing and\nscrewing, cutting and butting, at that little boat of ours, that seems as\nhard to build as Noah's ark; let us go on an excursion to the mountain\ntop, or have a hunt after the wild ducks, or make a dash at the pigs.  I'm\nquite flat--flat as bad ginger-beer--flat as a pancake; in fact, I want\nsomething to rouse me, to toss me up, as it were.  Eh! what do you say to\nit?\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Jack, throwing down the axe with which he was just about\nto proceed towards the boat, \"if that's what you want, I would recommend\nyou to make an excursion to the water-spouts; the last one we had to do\nwith tossed you up a considerable height, perhaps the next will send you\nhigher, who knows, if you're at all reasonable or moderate in your\nexpectations!\"\n\n\"Jack, my dear boy,\" said Peterkin, gravely, \"you are really becoming too\nfond of jesting.  It's a thing I don't at all approve of, and if you\ndon't give it up, I fear that, for our mutual good, we shall have to\npart.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Peterkin,\" replied Jack, with a smile, \"what would you\nhave?\"\n\n\"Have?\" said Peterkin, \"I would _have_ nothing.  I didn't say I wanted to\n_have_; I said that I wanted to _do_.\"\n\n\"By the by,\" said I, interrupting their conversation, \"I am reminded by\nthis that we have not yet discovered the nature of yon curious appearance\nthat we saw near the water-spouts, on our journey round the island.\nPerhaps it would be well to go for that purpose.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Peterkin, \"I know the nature of it well enough.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" said I.\n\n\"It was of a _mysterious_ nature to be sure!\" said he, with a wave of his\nhand, while he rose from the log on which he had been sitting, and\nbuckled on his belt, into which he thrust his enormous club.\n\n\"Well then, let us away to the water-spouts,\" cried Jack, going up to the\nbower for his bow and arrows; \"and bring your spear, Peterkin.  It may be\nuseful.\"\n\nWe now, having made up our minds to examine into this matter, sallied\nforth eagerly in the direction of the water-spout rocks, which, as I have\nbefore mentioned, were not far from our present place of abode.  On\narriving there we hastened down to the edge of the rocks, and gazed over\ninto the sea, where we observed the pale-green object still distinctly\nvisible, moving its tail slowly to and fro in the water.\n\n\"Most remarkable!\" said Jack.\n\n\"Exceedingly curious,\" said I.\n\n\"Beats everything!\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"Now, Jack,\" he added, \"you made such a poor figure in your last attempt\nto stick that object, that I would advise you to let me try it.  If it\nhas got a heart at all, I'll engage to send my spear right through the\ncore of it; if it hasn't got a heart, I'll send it through the spot where\nits heart ought to be.\"\n\n\"Fire away, then, my boy,\" replied Jack with a laugh.\n\nPeterkin immediately took the spear, poised it for a second or two above\nhis head, then darted it like an arrow into the sea.  Down it went\nstraight into the centre of the green object, passed quite through it,\nand came up immediately afterwards, pure and unsullied, while the\nmysterious tail moved quietly as before!\n\n\"Now,\" said Peterkin, gravely, \"that brute is a heartless monster; I'll\nhave nothing more to do with it.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure now,\" said Jack, \"that it is merely a phosphoric light;\nbut I must say I'm puzzled at its staying always in that exact spot.\"\n\nI also was much puzzled, and inclined to think with Jack that it must be\nphosphoric light; of which luminous appearance we had seen much while on\nour voyage to these seas.  \"But,\" said I, \"there is nothing to hinder us\nfrom diving down to it, now that we are sure it is not a shark.\"\n\n\"True,\" returned Jack, stripping off his clothes; \"I'll go down, Ralph,\nas I'm better at diving than you are.  Now then, Peterkin, out o' the\nroad!\"  Jack stepped forward, joined his hands above his head, bent over\nthe rocks, and plunged into the sea.  For a second or two the spray\ncaused by his dive hid him from view, then the water became still, and we\nsaw him swimming far down in the midst of the green object.  Suddenly he\nsank below it, and vanished altogether from our sight!  We gazed\nanxiously down at the spot where he had disappeared, for nearly a minute,\nexpecting every moment to see him rise again for breath; but fully a\nminute passed, and still he did not reappear.  Two minutes passed! and\nthen a flood of alarm rushed in upon my soul, when I considered that\nduring all my acquaintance with him, Jack had never stayed underwater\nmore than a minute at a time; indeed seldom so long.\n\n\"Oh, Peterkin!\" I said, in a voice that trembled with increasing anxiety,\n\"something has happened.  It is more than three minutes now!\"  But\nPeterkin did not answer and I observed that he was gazing down into the\nwater with a look of intense fear mingled with anxiety, while his face\nwas overspread with a deadly paleness.  Suddenly he sprang to his feet\nand rushed about in a frantic state, wringing his hands, and exclaiming,\n\"Oh, Jack, Jack! he is gone!  It must have been a shark, and he is gone\nfor ever!\"\n\nFor the next five minutes I know not what I did.  The intensity of my\nfeelings almost bereft me of my senses.  But I was recalled to myself by\nPeterkin seizing me by the shoulder and staring wildly into my face,\nwhile he exclaimed, \"Ralph! Ralph! perhaps he has only fainted.  Dive for\nhim, Ralph!\"\n\nIt seemed strange that this did not occur to me sooner.  In a moment I\nrushed to the edge of the rocks, and, without waiting to throw off my\ngarments, was on the point to spring into the waves, when I observed\nsomething black rising up through the green object.  In another moment\nJack's head rose to the surface, and he gave a wild shout, flinging back\nthe spray from his locks, as was his wont after a dive.  Now we were\nalmost as much amazed at seeing him reappear, well and strong, as we had\nbeen at first at his non-appearance; for, to the best of our judgment, he\nhad been nearly ten minutes under water, perhaps longer, and it required\nno exertion of our reason to convince us that this was utterly impossible\nfor mortal man to do and retain his strength and faculties.  It was\ntherefore with a feeling akin to superstitious awe that I held down my\nhand and assisted him to clamber up the steep rocks.  But no such feeling\naffected Peterkin.  No sooner did Jack gain the rocks and seat himself on\none, panting for breath, than he threw his arms round his neck, and burst\ninto a flood of tears.  \"Oh, Jack, Jack!\" said he, \"where were you?  What\nkept you so long?\"\n\nAfter a few moments Peterkin became composed enough to sit still and\nlisten to Jack's explanation, although he could not restrain himself from\nattempting to wink every two minutes at me, in order to express his joy\nat Jack's safety.  I say he attempted to wink, but I am bound to add that\nhe did not succeed, for his eyes were so much swollen with weeping, that\nhis frequent attempts only resulted in a series of violent and altogether\nidiotical contortions of the face, that were very far from expressing\nwhat he intended.  However, I knew what the poor fellow meant by it, so I\nsmiled to him in return, and endeavoured to make believe that he was\nwinking.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, when we were composed enough to listen to him,\n\"yon green object is not a shark; it is a stream of light issuing from a\ncave in the rocks.  Just after I made my dive, I observed that this light\ncame from the side of the rock above which we are now sitting; so I\nstruck out for it, and saw an opening into some place or other that\nappeared to be luminous within.  For one instant I paused to think\nwhether I ought to venture.  Then I made up my mind, and dashed into it.\nFor you see, Peterkin, although I take some time to tell this, it\nhappened in the space of a few seconds, so that I knew I had wind enough\nin me to serve to bring me out o' the hole and up to the surface again.\nWell, I was just on the point of turning,--for I began to feel a little\nuncomfortable in such a place,--when it seemed to me as if there was a\nfaint light right above me.  I darted upwards, and found my head out of\nwater.  This relieved me greatly, for I now felt that I could take in air\nenough to enable me to return the way I came.  Then it all at once\noccurred to me that I might not be able to find the way out again; but,\non glancing downwards, my mind was put quite at rest by seeing the green\nlight below me streaming into the cave, just like the light that we had\nseen streaming out of it, only what I now saw was much brighter.\n\n\"At first I could scarcely see anything as I gazed around me, it was so\ndark; but gradually my eyes became accustomed to it, and I found that I\nwas in a huge cave, part of the walls of which I observed on each side of\nme.  The ceiling just above me was also visible, and I fancied that I\ncould perceive beautiful glittering objects there, but the farther end of\nthe cave was shrouded in darkness.  While I was looking around me in\ngreat wonder, it came into my head that you two would think I was\ndrowned; so I plunged down through the passage again in a great hurry,\nrose to the surface, and--here I am!\"\n\nWhen Jack concluded his recital of what he had seen in this remarkable\ncave, I could not rest satisfied till I had dived down to see it; which I\ndid, but found it so dark, as Jack had said, that I could scarcely see\nanything.  When I returned, we had a long conversation about it, during\nwhich I observed that Peterkin had a most lugubrious expression on his\ncountenance.\n\n\"What's the matter, Peterkin?\" said I.\n\n\"The matter?\" he replied.  \"It's all very well for you two to be talking\naway like mermaids about the wonders of this cave, but you know I must be\ncontent to hear about it, while you are enjoying yourselves down there\nlike mad dolphins.  It's really too bad.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry for you, Peterkin, indeed I am,\" said Jack, \"but we\ncannot help you.  If you would only learn to dive--\"\n\n\"Learn to fly, you might as well say!\" retorted Peterkin, in a very sulky\ntone.\n\n\"If you would only consent to keep still,\" said I, \"we would take you\ndown with us in ten seconds.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" returned Peterkin; \"suppose a salamander was to propose to you\n'only to keep still,' and he would carry you through a blazing fire in a\nfew seconds, what would you say?\"\n\nWe both laughed and shook our heads, for it was evident that nothing was\nto be made of Peterkin in the water.  But we could not rest satisfied\ntill we had seen more of this cave; so, after further consultation, Jack\nand I determined to try if we could take down a torch with us, and set\nfire to it in the cavern.  This we found to be an undertaking of no small\ndifficulty; but we accomplished it at last by the following means:--First,\nwe made a torch of a very inflammable nature out of the bark of a certain\ntree, which we cut into strips, and, after twisting, cemented together\nwith a kind of resin or gum, which we also obtained from another tree;\nneither of which trees, however, was known by name to Jack.  This, when\nprepared, we wrapped up in a great number of plies of cocoa-nut cloth, so\nthat we were confident it could not get wet during the short time it\nshould be under water.  Then we took a small piece of the tinder, which\nwe had carefully treasured up lest we should require it, as before said,\nwhen the sun should fail us; also, we rolled up some dry grass and a few\nchips, which, with a little bow and drill, like those described before,\nwe made into another bundle, and wrapped it up in cocoa-nut cloth.  When\nall was ready we laid aside our garments, with the exception of our\ntrousers, which, as we did not know what rough scraping against the rocks\nwe might be subjected to, we kept on.\n\nThen we advanced to the edge of the rocks, Jack carrying one bundle, with\nthe torch; I the other, with the things for producing fire.\n\n\"Now don't weary for us, Peterkin, should we be gone some time,\" said\nJack; \"we'll be sure to return in half-an-hour at the very latest,\nhowever interesting the cave should be, that we may relieve your mind.\"\n\n\"Farewell!\" said Peterkin, coming up to us with a look of deep but\npretended solemnity, while he shook hands and kissed each of us on the\ncheek.  \"Farewell! and while you are gone I shall repose my weary limbs\nunder the shelter of this bush, and meditate on the changefulness of all\nthings earthly, with special reference to the forsaken condition of a\npoor ship-wrecked sailor boy!\"  So saying, Peterkin waved his hand,\nturned from us, and cast himself upon the ground with a look of\nmelancholy resignation, which was so well feigned, that I would have\nthought it genuine had he not accompanied it with a gentle wink.  We both\nlaughed, and, springing from the rocks together, plunged head first into\nthe sea.\n\nWe gained the interior of the submarine cave without difficulty, and, on\nemerging from the waves, supported ourselves for some time by treading-\nwater, while we held the two bundles above our heads.  This we did in\norder to let our eyes become accustomed to the obscurity.  Then, when we\ncould see sufficiently, we swam to a shelving rock, and landed in safety.\nHaving wrung the water from our trousers, and dried ourselves as well as\nwe could under the circumstances, we proceeded to ignite the torch.  This\nwe accomplished without difficulty in a few minutes; and no sooner did it\nflare up than we were struck dumb with the wonderful objects that were\nrevealed to our gaze.  The roof of the cavern just above us seemed to be\nabout ten feet high, but grew higher as it receded into the distance,\nuntil it was lost in darkness.  It seemed to be made of coral, and was\nsupported by massive columns of the same material.  Immense icicles (as\nthey appeared to us) hung from it in various places.  These, however,\nwere formed, not of ice, but of a species of limestone, which seemed to\nflow in a liquid form towards the point of each, where it became solid.  A\ngood many drops fell, however, to the rock below, and these formed little\ncones, which rose to meet the points above.  Some of them had already\nmet, and thus we saw how the pillars were formed, which at first seemed\nto us as if they had been placed there by some human architect to support\nthe roof.  As we advanced farther in, we saw that the floor was composed\nof the same material as the pillars; and it presented the curious\nappearance of ripples, such as are formed on water when gently ruffled by\nthe wind.  There were several openings on either hand in the walls, that\nseemed to lead into other caverns; but these we did not explore at this\ntime.  We also observed that the ceiling was curiously marked in many\nplaces, as if it were the fret-work of a noble cathedral; and the walls,\nas well as the roof, sparkled in the light of our torch, and threw back\ngleams and flashes, as if they were covered with precious stones.\nAlthough we proceeded far into this cavern, we did not come to the end of\nit; and we were obliged to return more speedily than we would otherwise\nhave done, as our torch was nearly expended.  We did not observe any\nopenings in the roof, or any indications of places whereby light might\nenter; but near the entrance to the cavern stood an immense mass of pure\nwhite coral rock, which caught and threw back the little light that found\nan entrance through the cave's mouth, and thus produced, we conjectured,\nthe pale-green object which had first attracted our attention.  We\nconcluded, also, that the reflecting power of this rock was that which\ngave forth the dim light that faintly illumined the first part of the\ncave.\n\nBefore diving through the passage again we extinguished the small piece\nof our torch that remained, and left it in a dry spot; conceiving that we\nmight possibly stand in need of it, if at any future time we should\nchance to wet our torch while diving into the cavern.  As we stood for a\nfew minutes after it was out, waiting till our eyes became accustomed to\nthe gloom, we could not help remarking the deep, intense stillness and\nthe unutterable gloom of all around us; and, as I thought of the\nstupendous dome above, and the countless gems that had sparkled in the\ntorch-light a few minutes before, it came into my mind to consider how\nstrange it is that God should make such wonderful and extremely-beautiful\nworks never to be seen at all, except, indeed, by chance visitors such as\nourselves.\n\nI afterwards found that there were many such caverns among the islands of\nthe South Seas, some of them larger and more beautiful than the one I\nhave just described.\n\n\"Now, Ralph, are you ready?\" said Jack, in a low voice, that seemed to\necho up into the dome above.\n\n\"Quite ready.\"\n\n\"Come along, then,\" said he; and, plunging off the ledge of the rock into\nthe water, we dived through the narrow entrance.  In a few seconds we\nwere panting on the rocks above, and receiving the congratulations of our\nfriend Peterkin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nStrange peculiarity of the tides--Also of the twilight--Peterkin's\nremarkable conduct in embracing a little pig and killing a big sow--Sage\nremarks on jesting--Also on love.\n\nIt was quite a relief to us to breathe the pure air and to enjoy the glad\nsunshine after our long ramble in the Diamond Cave, as we named it; for,\nalthough we did not stay more than half an hour away, it seemed to us\nmuch longer.  While we were dressing, and during our walk home, we did\nour best to satisfy the curiosity of poor Peterkin, who seemed to regret,\nwith lively sincerity, his inability to dive.\n\nThere was no help for it, however, so we condoled with him as we best\ncould.  Had there been any great rise or fall in the tide of these seas,\nwe might perhaps have found it possible to take him down with us at low\nwater; but as the tide never rose or fell more than eighteen inches or\ntwo feet, this was impossible.\n\nThis peculiarity of the tide--its slight rise and fall--had not attracted\nour observation till some time after our residence on the island.  Neither\nhad we observed another curious circumstance until we had been some time\nthere.  This was the fact, that the tide rose and fell with constant\nregularity, instead of being affected by the changes of the moon as in\nour own country, and as it is in most other parts of the world,--at least\nin all those parts with which I am acquainted.  Every day and every\nnight, at twelve o'clock precisely, the tide is at the full; and at six\no'clock every morning and evening it is ebb.  I can speak with much\nconfidence on this singular circumstance, as we took particular note of\nit, and never found it to alter.  Of course, I must admit, we had to\nguess the hour of twelve midnight, and I think we could do this pretty\ncorrectly; but in regard to twelve noon we are quite positive, because we\neasily found the highest point that the sun reached in the sky by placing\nourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the sharp summit of a\ncliff resting against the sky, just where the sun passed.\n\nJack and I were surprised that we had not noticed this the first few days\nof our residence here, and could only account for it by our being so much\ntaken up with the more obvious wonders of our novel situation.  I have\nsince learned, however, that this want of observation is a sad and very\ncommon infirmity of human nature, there being hundreds of persons before\nwhose eyes the most wonderful things are passing every day, who\nnevertheless are totally ignorant of them.  I therefore have to record my\nsympathy with such persons, and to recommend to them a course of conduct\nwhich I have now for a long time myself adopted,--namely, the habit of\nforcing my attention upon _all_ things that go on around me, and of\ntaking some degree of interest in them, whether I feel it naturally or\nnot.  I suggest this the more earnestly, though humbly, because I have\nvery frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has\ngenerally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it.\n\nWe had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides; and Jack\ntold us, in his own quiet, philosophical way, that these tides did great\ngood to the world in many ways, particularly in the way of cleansing the\nshores of the land, and carrying off the filth that was constantly poured\ninto the sea there-from; which, Peterkin suggested, was remarkably _tidy_\nof it to do.  Poor Peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to joke,\nhowever inopportune it might be: which at first we found rather a\ndisagreeable propensity, as it often interrupted the flow of very\nagreeable conversation; and, indeed, I cannot too strongly record my\ndisapprobation of this tendency in general: but we became so used to it\nat last that we found it no interruption whatever; indeed, strange to\nsay, we came to feel that it was a necessary part of our enjoyment (such\nis the force of habit), and found the sudden outbursts of mirth,\nresulting from his humorous disposition, quite natural and refreshing to\nus in the midst of our more serious conversations.  But I must not\nmisrepresent Peterkin.  We often found, to our surprise, that he knew\nmany things which we did not; and I also observed that those things which\nhe learned from experience were never forgotten.  From all these things I\ncame at length to understand that things very opposite and dissimilar in\nthemselves, when united, do make an agreeable whole; as, for example, we\nthree on this our island, although most unlike in many things, when\nunited, made a trio so harmonious that I question if there ever met\nbefore such an agreeable triumvirate.  There was, indeed, no note of\ndiscord whatever in the symphony we played together on that sweet Coral\nIsland; and I am now persuaded that this was owing to our having been all\ntuned to the same key, namely, that of _love_!  Yes, we loved one another\nwith much fervency while we lived on that island; and, for the matter of\nthat, we love each other still.\n\nAnd while I am on this subject, or rather the subject that just preceded\nit--namely, the tides--I may here remark on another curious natural\nphenomenon.  We found that there was little or no twilight in this\nisland.  We had a distinct remembrance of the charming long twilight at\nhome, which some people think the most delightful part of the day, though\nfor my part I have always preferred sunrise; and when we first landed, we\nused to sit down on some rocky point or eminence, at the close of our\nday's work, to enjoy the evening breeze; but no sooner had the sun sunk\nbelow the horizon than all became suddenly dark.  This rendered it\nnecessary that we should watch the sun when we happened to be out\nhunting, for to be suddenly left in the dark while in the woods was very\nperplexing, as, although the stars shone with great beauty and\nbrilliancy, they could not pierce through the thick umbrageous boughs\nthat interlaced above our heads.\n\nBut, to return: After having told all we could to Peterkin about the\nDiamond Cave under Spouting Cliff, as we named the locality, we were\nwending our way rapidly homewards, when a grunt and a squeal were borne\ndown by the land breeze to our ears.\n\n\"That's the ticket!\" was Peterkin's remarkable exclamation, as he started\nconvulsively, and levelled his spear.\n\n\"Hist!\" cried Jack; \"these are your friends, Peterkin.  They must have\ncome over expressly to pay you a friendly visit, for it is the first time\nwe have seen them on this side the island.\"\n\n\"Come along!\" cried Peterkin, hurrying towards the wood, while Jack and I\nfollowed, smiling at his impatience.\n\nAnother grunt and half a dozen squeals, much louder than before, came\ndown the valley.  At this time we were just opposite the small vale which\nlay between the Valley of the Wreck and Spouting Cliff.\n\n\"I say, Peterkin,\" cried Jack, in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Well, what is't?\"\n\n\"Stay a bit, man.  These grunters are just up there on the hill side.  If\nyou go and stand with Ralph in the lee of yon cliff, I'll cut round\nbehind and drive them through the gorge, so that you'll have a better\nchance of picking out a good one.  Now, mind you pitch into a fat young\npig, Peterkin,\" added Jack, as he sprang into the bushes.\n\n\"Won't I, just!\" said Peterkin, licking his lips, as we took our station\nbeside the cliff.  \"I feel quite a tender affection for young pigs in my\nheart.  Perhaps it would be more correct to say in my s--.\"\n\n\"There they come!\" cried I, as a terrific yell from Jack sent the whole\nherd screaming down the hill.  Now, Peterkin, being unable to hold back,\ncrept a short way up a very steep grassy mound, in order to get a better\nview of the hogs before they came up; and just as he raised his head\nabove its summit, two little pigs, which had outrun their companions,\nrushed over the top with the utmost precipitation.  One of these brushed\nclose past Peterkin's ear; the other, unable to arrest its headlong\nflight, went, as Peterkin himself afterwards expressed it, \"bash\" into\nhis arms with a sudden squeal, which was caused more by the force of the\nblow than the will of the animal, and both of them rolled violently down\nto the foot of the mound.  No sooner was this reached than the little pig\nrecovered its feet, tossed up its tail, and fled shrieking from the spot.\nBut I slang a large stone after it, which, being fortunately well aimed,\nhit it behind the ear, and felled it to the earth.\n\n\"Capital, Ralph! that's your sort!\" cried Peterkin, who, to my surprise\nand great relief, had risen to his feet.  Apparently unhurt, though much\ndishevelled, he rushed franticly towards the gorge, which the yells of\nthe hogs told us they were now approaching.  I had made up my mind that I\nwould abstain from killing another, as, if Peterkin should be successful,\ntwo were more than sufficient for our wants at the present time.  Suddenly\nthey all burst forth,--two or three little round ones in advance, and an\nenormous old sow with a drove of hogs at her heels.\n\n\"Now, Peterkin,\" said I, \"there's a nice little fat one; just spear it.\"\n\nBut Peterkin did not move; he allowed it to pass unharmed.  I looked at\nhim in surprise, and saw that his lips were compressed and his eyebrows\nknitted, as if he were about to fight with some awful enemy.\n\n\"What is it?\" I inquired, with some trepidation.\n\nSuddenly he levelled his spear, darted forward, and, with a yell that\nnearly froze the blood in my veins, stabbed the old sow to the heart.\nNay, so vigorously was it done that the spear went in at one side and\ncame out at the other!\n\n\"Oh, Peterkin!\" said I, going up to him, \"what have you done?\"\n\n\"Done?  I've killed their great-great-grandmother, that's all,\" said he,\nlooking with a somewhat awe-struck expression at the transfixed animal.\n\n\"Hallo! what's this?\" said Jack, as he came up.  \"Why, Peterkin, you must\nbe fond of a tough chop.  If you mean to eat this old hog, she'll try\nyour jaws, I warrant.  What possessed you to stick _her_, Peterkin?\"\n\n\"Why, the fact is I want a pair of shoes.\"\n\n\"What have your shoes to do with the old hog?' said I, smiling.\n\n\"My present shoes have certainly nothing to do with her,\" replied\nPeterkin; \"nevertheless she will have a good deal to do with my future\nshoes.  The fact is, when I saw you floor that pig so neatly, Ralph, it\nstruck me that there was little use in killing another.  Then I\nremembered all at once that I had long wanted some leather or tough\nsubstance to make shoes of, and this old grandmother seemed so tough that\nI just made up my mind to stick her, and you see I've done it!\"\n\n\"That you certainly have, Peterkin,\" said Jack, as he was examining the\ntransfixed animal.\n\nWe now considered how we were to carry our game home, for, although the\ndistance was short, the hog was very heavy.  At length we hit on the plan\nof tying its four feet together, and passing the spear handle between\nthem.  Jack took one end on his shoulder, I took the other on mine, and\nPeterkin carried the small pig.\n\nThus we returned in triumph to our bower, laden, as Peterkin remarked,\nwith the glorious spoils of a noble hunt.  As he afterwards spoke in\nsimilarly glowing terms in reference to the supper that followed, there\nis every reason to believe that we retired that night to our leafy beds\nin a high state of satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nBoat-building extraordinary--Peterkin tries his hand at cookery and fails\nmost signally--The boat finished--Curious conversation with the cat, and\nother matters.\n\nFor many days after this Jack applied himself with unremitting assiduity\nto the construction of our boat, which at length began to look somewhat\nlike one.  But those only who have had the thing to do can entertain a\nright idea of the difficulty involved in such an undertaking, with no\nother implements than an axe, a bit of hoop-iron, a sail-needle, and a\nbroken pen-knife.  But Jack did it.  He was of, that disposition which\n_will_ not be conquered.  When he believed himself to be acting rightly,\nhe overcame all obstacles.  I have seen Jack, when doubtful whether what\nhe was about to do were right or wrong, as timid and vacillating as a\nlittle girl,--and I honour him for it!\n\nAs this boat was a curiosity in its way, a few words here relative to the\nmanner of its construction may not be amiss.\n\nI have already mentioned the chestnut tree with its wonderful buttresses\nor planks.  This tree, then, furnished us with the chief part of our\nmaterial.  First of all Jack sought out a limb of a tree of such a form\nand size as, while it should form the keel a bend at either end should\nform the stem and stern posts.  Such a piece, however, was not easy to\nobtain, but at last he procured it, by rooting up a small tree which had\na branch growing at the proper angle about ten feet up its stem, with two\nstrong roots growing in such a form as enabled him to make a flat-sterned\nboat.  This placed, he procured three branching roots of suitable size,\nwhich he fitted to the keel at equal distances, thus forming three strong\nribs.  Now, the squaring and shaping of these, and the cutting of the\ngrooves in the keel, was an easy enough matter, as it was all work for\nthe axe, in the use of which Jack was become wonderfully expert; but it\nwas quite a different affair when he came to nailing the ribs to the\nkeel, for we had no instrument capable of boring a large hole, and no\nnails to fasten them with.  We were, indeed, much perplexed here; but\nJack at length devised an instrument that served very well.  He took the\nremainder of our hoop-iron and beat it into the form of a pipe or\ncylinder, about as thick as a man's finger.  This he did by means of our\naxe and the old rusty axe we had found at the house of the poor man at\nthe other side of the island.  This, when made red hot, bored slowly\nthough the timbers; and, the better to retain the heat, Jack shut up one\nend of it and filled it with sand.  True, the work was very slowly done,\nbut it mattered not--we had little else to do.  Two holes were bored in\neach timber, about an inch and a half apart, and also down into the keel,\nbut not quite through.  Into these were placed stout pegs made of a tree\ncalled iron-wood; and, when they were hammered well home, the timbers\nwere as firmly fixed as if they had been nailed with iron.  The gunwales,\nwhich were very stout, were fixed in a similar manner.  But, besides the\nwooden nails, they were firmly lashed to the stem and stern posts and\nribs by means of a species of cordage which we had contrived to make out\nof the fibrous husk of the cocoa nut.  This husk was very tough, and when\na number of the threads were joined together they formed excellent\ncordage.  At first we tied the different lengths together, but this was\nsuch a clumsy and awkward complication of knots, that we contrived, by\ncareful interlacing of the ends together before twisting, to make good\ncordage of any size or length we chose.  Of course it cost us much time\nand infinite labour, but Jack kept up our spirits when we grew weary, and\nso all that we required was at last constructed.\n\nPlanks were now cut off the chestnut trees of about an inch thick.  These\nwere dressed with the axe,--but clumsily, for an axe is ill adapted for\nsuch work.  Five of these planks on each side were sufficient, and we\nformed the boat in a very rounded, barrel-like shape, in order to have as\nlittle twisting of the planks as possible; for, although we could easily\nbend them, we could not easily twist them.  Having no nails to rivet the\nplanks with, we threw aside the ordinary fashion of boat building and\nadopted one of our own.  The planks were therefore placed on each other's\nedges, and sewed together with the tough cordage already mentioned.  They\nwere also thus sewed to the stem, the stern, and the keel.  Each stitch\nor tie was six inches apart, and was formed thus: Three holes were bored\nin the upper plank and three in the lower,--the holes being above each\nother, that is, in a vertical line.  Through these holes the cord was\npassed, and, when tied, formed a powerful stitch of three ply.  Besides\nthis, we placed between the edges of the planks, layers of cocoa-nut\nfibre, which, as it swelled when wetted, would, we hoped, make our little\nvessel water-tight.  But in order further to secure this end, we\ncollected a large quantity of pitch from the bread-fruit tree, with\nwhich, when boiled in our old iron pot, we payed the whole of the inside\nof the boat, and, while it was yet hot, placed large pieces of cocoa-nut\ncloth on it, and then gave it another coat above that.  Thus the interior\nwas covered with a tough water-tight material; while the exterior, being\nuncovered, and so exposed to the swelling action of the water, was we\nhoped, likely to keep the boat quite dry.  I may add that our hopes were\nnot disappointed.\n\nWhile Jack was thus engaged, Peterkin and I sometimes assisted him, but,\nas our assistance was not much required, we more frequently went\na-hunting on the extensive mud-flats at the entrance of the long valley\nwhich lay nearest to our bower.  Here we found large flocks of ducks of\nvarious kinds, some of them bearing so much resemblance to the wild ducks\nof our own country that I think they must have been the same.  On these\noccasions we took the bow and the sling, with both of which we were often\nsuccessful, though I must confess I was the least so.  Our suppers were\nthus pleasantly varied, and sometimes we had such a profusion spread out\nbefore us that we frequently knew not with which of the dainties to\nbegin.\n\nI must also add, that the poor old cat which we had brought home had\nalways a liberal share of our good things, and so well was it looked\nafter, especially by Peterkin, that it recovered much of its former\nstrength, and seemed to improve in sight as well as hearing.\n\n{Leaving for the \"mud-flats\": p175.jpg}\n\nThe large flat stone, or rock of coral, which stood just in front of the\nentrance to our bower, was our table.  On this rock we had spread out the\nfew articles we possessed the day we were shipwrecked; and on the same\nrock, during many a day afterwards, we spread out the bountiful supply\nwith which we had been blessed on our Coral Island.  Sometimes we sat\ndown at this table to a feast consisting of hot rolls,--as Peterkin\ncalled the newly baked bread fruit,--a roast pig, roast duck, boiled and\nroasted yams, cocoa nuts, taro, and sweet potatoes; which we followed up\nwith a dessert of plums, apples, and plantains,--the last being a large-\nsized and delightful fruit, which grew on a large shrub or tree not more\nthan twelve feet high, with light-green leaves of enormous length and\nbreadth.  These luxurious feasts were usually washed down with cocoa-nut\nlemonade.\n\nOccasionally Peterkin tried to devise some new dish,--\"a conglomerate,\"\nas he used to say; but these generally turned out such atrocious\ncompounds that he was ultimately induced to give up his attempts in\nextreme disgust.  Not forgetting, however, to point out to Jack that his\nfailure was a direct contradiction to the proverb which he, Jack, was\nconstantly thrusting down his throat, namely, that \"where there's a will\nthere's a way.\"  For he had a great will to become a cook, but could by\nno means find a way to accomplish that end.\n\nOne day, while Peterkin and I were seated beside our table on which\ndinner was spread, Jack came up from the beach, and, flinging down his\naxe, exclaimed,--\n\n\"There, lads, the boat's finished at last! so we've nothing to do now but\nshape two pair of oars, and then we may put to sea as soon as we like.\"\n\nThis piece of news threw us into a state of great joy; for although we\nwere aware that the boat had been gradually getting near its completion,\nit had taken so long that we did not expect it to be quite ready for at\nleast two or three weeks.  But Jack had wrought hard and said nothing, in\norder to surprise us.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" cried Peterkin, \"you're a perfect trump.  But why did\nyou not tell us it was so nearly ready? won't we have a jolly sail to-\nmorrow? eh?\"\n\n\"Don't talk so much, Peterkin,\" said Jack; \"and, pray, hand me a bit of\nthat pig.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear,\" cried Peterkin, seizing the axe; \"what part will\nyou have? a leg, or a wing, or a piece of the breast; which?\"\n\n\"A hind leg, if you please,\" answered Jack; \"and, pray, be so good as to\ninclude the tail.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Peterkin, exchanging the axe for his hoop-iron\nknife, with which he cut off the desired portion.  \"I'm only too glad, my\ndear boy, to see that your appetite is so wholesale; and there's no\nchance whatever of its dwindling down into re-tail again, at least in so\nfar as this pig is concerned.  Ralph, lad, why don't you laugh?--eh?\" he\nadded turning suddenly to me with a severe look of inquiry.\n\n\"Laugh?\" said I; \"what at, Peterkin? why should I laugh?\"\n\nBoth Jack and Peterkin answered this inquiry by themselves laughing so\nimmoderately that I was induced to believe I had missed noticing some\ngood joke, so I begged that it might be explained to me; but as this only\nproduced repeated roars of laughter, I smiled and helped myself to\nanother slice of plantain.\n\n\"Well, but,\" continued Peterkin, \"I was talking of a sail to-morrow.\nCan't we have one, Jack?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Jack, \"we can't have a sail, but I hope we shall have a\nrow, as I intend to work hard at the oars this afternoon, and, if we\ncan't get them finished by sunset we'll light our candle-nuts, and turn\nthem out of hands before we turn into bed.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Peterkin, tossing a lump of pork to the cat, who\nreceived it with a mew of satisfaction.  \"I'll help you, if I can.\"\n\n\"Afterwards,\" continued Jack, \"we will make a sail out of the cocoa-nut\ncloth, and rig up a mast, and then we shall be able to sail to some of\nthe other islands, and visit our old friends the penguins.\"\n\nThe prospect of being so soon in a position to extend our observations to\nthe other islands, and enjoy a sail over the beautiful sea, afforded us\nmuch delight, and, after dinner, we set about making the oars in good\nearnest.  Jack went into the woods and blocked them roughly out with the\naxe, and I smoothed them down with the knife, while Peterkin remained in\nthe bower, spinning, or, rather, twisting some strong thick cordage with\nwhich to fasten them to the boat.\n\nWe worked hard and rapidly, so that, when the sun went down, Jack and I\nreturned to the bower with four stout oars, which required little to be\ndone to them save a slight degree of polishing with the knife.  As we\ndrew near we were suddenly arrested by the sound of a voice!  We were not\na little surprised at this--indeed I may almost say alarmed--for,\nalthough Peterkin was undoubtedly fond of talking, we had never, up to\nthis time, found him talking to himself.  We listened intently, and still\nheard the sound of a voice as if in conversation.  Jack motioned me to be\nsilent, and, advancing to the bower on tip-toe, we peeped in.\n\nThe sight that met our gaze was certainly not a little amusing.  On the\ntop of a log which we sometimes used as a table, sat the black cat, with\na very demure expression on its countenance; and in front of it, sitting\non the ground, with his legs extended on either side of the log, was\nPeterkin.  At the moment we saw him he was gazing intently into the cat's\nface, with his nose about four inches from it,--his hands being thrust\ninto his breeches pockets.\n\n\"Cat,\" said Peterkin, turning his head a little on one side, \"I love\nyou!\"\n\nThere was a pause, as if Peterkin awaited a reply to this affectionate\ndeclaration but the cat said nothing.\n\n\"Do you hear me?\" cried Peterkin, sharply.  \"I love you--I do.  Don't you\nlove me?\"\n\nTo this touching appeal the cat said \"Mew,\" faintly.\n\n\"Ah! that's right.  You're a jolly old rascal.  Why did you not speak at\nonce? eh?\" and Peterkin put forward his mouth and kissed the cat on the\nnose!\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Peterkin, after a pause, \"I love you.  D'you think I'd\nsay so if I didn't, you black villain?  I love you because I've got to\ntake care of you, and to look after you, and to think about you, and to\nsee that you don't die--\"\n\n\"Mew, me-a-w!\" said the cat.\n\n\"Very good,\" continued Peterkin, \"quite true, I have no doubt; but you've\nno right to interrupt me, sir.  Hold your tongue till I have done\nspeaking.  Moreover, cat, I love you because you came to me the first\ntime you ever saw me, and didn't seem to be afraid, and appeared to be\nfond of me, though you didn't know that I wasn't going to kill you.  Now,\nthat was brave, that was bold, and very jolly, old boy, and I love you\nfor it--I do!\"\n\nAgain there was a pause of a few minutes, during which the cat looked\nplacid, and Peterkin dropped his eyes upon its toes as if in\ncontemplation.  Suddenly he looked up.\n\n\"Well, cat, what are you thinking about now? won't speak? eh?  Now, tell\nme; don't you think it's a monstrous shame that these two scoundrels,\nJack and Ralph, should keep us waiting for our supper so long?\"\n\nHere the cat arose, put up its back and stretched itself; yawned\nslightly, and licked the point of Peterkin's nose!\n\n\"Just so, old boy, you're a clever fellow,--I really do believe the brute\nunderstands me!\" said Peterkin, while a broad grin overspread his face,\nas he drew back and surveyed the cat.\n\nAt this point Jack burst into a loud fit of laughter.  The cat uttered an\nangry fuff and fled, while Peterkin sprang up and exclaimed,--\n\n\"Bad luck to you, Jack! you've nearly made the heart jump out of my body,\nyou have.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have,\" replied Jack, laughing, as we entered the bower, \"but,\nas I don't intend to keep you or the cat any longer from your supper, I\nhope that you'll both forgive me.\"\n\nPeterkin endeavoured to turn this affair off with a laugh, but I observed\nthat he blushed very deeply at the time we discovered ourselves, and he\ndid not seem to relish any allusion to the subject afterwards; so we\nrefrained from remarking on it ever after,--though it tickled us not a\nlittle at the time.\n\nAfter supper we retired to rest and to dream of wonderful adventures in\nour little boat, and distant voyages upon the sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nThe boat launched--We visit the coral reef--The great breaker that never\ngoes down--Coral insects--The way in which coral islands are made--The\nboat's sail--We tax our ingenuity to form fish-hooks--Some of the fish we\nsaw--And a monstrous whale--Wonderful shower of little fish--Water-spouts.\n\nIt was a bright, clear, beautiful morning, when we first launched our\nlittle boat and rowed out upon the placid waters of the lagoon.  Not a\nbreath of wind ruffled the surface of the deep.  Not a cloud spotted the\ndeep blue sky.  Not a sound that was discordant broke the stillness of\nthe morning, although there were many sounds, sweet, tiny, and melodious,\nthat mingled in the universal harmony of nature.  The sun was just rising\nfrom the Pacific's ample bosom and tipping the mountain tops with a red\nglow.  The sea was shining like a sheet of glass, yet heaving with the\nlong deep swell that, all the world round, indicates the life of ocean;\nand the bright sea-weeds and the brilliant corals shone in the depths of\nthat pellucid water, as we rowed over it, like rare and precious gems.\nOh! it was a sight fitted to stir the soul of man to its profoundest\ndepths, and, if he owned a heart at all, to lift that heart in adoration\nand gratitude to the great Creator of this magnificent and glorious\nuniverse.\n\nAt first, in the strength of our delight, we rowed hither and thither\nwithout aim or object.  But after the effervescence of our spirits was\nabated, we began to look about us and to consider what we should do.\n\n\"I vote that we row to the reef,\" cried Peterkin.\n\n\"And I vote that we visit the islands within the lagoon,\" said I.\n\n\"And I vote we do both,\" cried Jack, \"so pull away, boys.\"\n\nAs I have already said, we had made four oars, but our boat was so small\nthat only two were necessary.  The extra pair were reserved in case any\naccident should happen to the others.  It was therefore only needful that\ntwo of us should row, while the third steered, by means of an oar, and\nrelieved the rowers occasionally.\n\nFirst we landed on one of the small islands and ran all over it, but saw\nnothing worthy of particular notice.  Then we landed on a larger island,\non which were growing a few cocoa-nut trees.  Not having eaten anything\nthat morning, we gathered a few of the nuts and breakfasted.  After this\nwe pulled straight out to sea and landed on the coral reef.\n\nThis was indeed a novel and interesting sight to us.  We had now been so\nlong on shore that we had almost forgotten the appearance of breakers,\nfor there were none within the lagoon; but now, as we stood beside the\nfoam-crested billow of the open sea, all the enthusiasm of the sailor was\nawakened in our breasts; and, as we gazed on the wide-spread ruin of that\nsingle magnificent breaker that burst in thunder at our feet, we forgot\nthe Coral Island behind us; we forgot our bower and the calm repose of\nthe scented woods; we forgot all that had passed during the last few\nmonths, and remembered nothing but the storms, the calms, the fresh\nbreezes and the surging billows of the open sea.\n\nThis huge, ceaseless breaker, to which I have so often alluded, was a\nmuch larger and more sublime object than we had at all imagined it to be.\nIt rose many yards above the level of the sea, and could be seen\napproaching at some distance from the reef.  Slowly and majestically it\ncame on, acquiring greater volume and velocity as it advanced, until it\nassumed the form of a clear watery arch, which sparkled in the bright\nsun.  On it came with resistless and solemn majesty,--the upper edge\nlipped gently over, and it fell with a roar that seemed as though the\nheart of Ocean were broken in the crash of tumultuous water, while the\nfoam-clad coral reef appeared to tremble beneath the mighty shock!\n\nWe gazed long and wonderingly at this great sight, and it was with\ndifficulty we could tear ourselves away from it.  As I have once before\nmentioned, this wave broke in many places over the reef and scattered\nsome of its spray into the lagoon, but in most places the reef was\nsufficiently broad and elevated to receive and check its entire force.  In\nmany places the coral rocks were covered with vegetation,--the beginning,\nas it appeared to us, of future islands.  Thus, on this reef, we came to\nperceive how most of the small islands of those seas are formed.  On one\npart we saw the spray of the breaker washing over the rocks, and millions\nof little, active, busy creatures continuing the work of building up this\nliving rampart.  At another place, which was just a little too high for\nthe waves to wash over it, the coral insects were all dead; for we found\nthat they never did their work above water.  They had faithfully\ncompleted the mighty work which their Creator had given them to do, and\nthey were now all dead.  Again, in other spots the ceaseless lashing of\nthe sea had broken the dead coral in pieces, and cast it up in the form\nof sand.  Here sea-birds had alighted, little pieces of sea-weed and\nstray bits of wood had been washed up, seeds of plants had been carried\nby the wind and a few lovely blades of bright green had already sprung\nup, which, when they died, would increase the size and fertility of these\nemeralds of Ocean.  At other places these islets had grown apace, and\nwere shaded by one or two cocoa-nut trees, which grew, literally, in the\nsand, and were constantly washed by the ocean spray; yet, as I have\nbefore remarked, their fruit was most refreshing and sweet to our taste.\n\nAgain at this time Jack and I pondered the formation of the large coral\nislands.  We could now understand how the low ones were formed, but the\nlarger islands cost us much consideration, yet we could arrive at no\ncertain conclusion on the subject.\n\nHaving satisfied our curiosity and enjoyed ourselves during the whole\nday, in our little boat, we returned, somewhat wearied, and, withal,\nrather hungry, to our bower.\n\n\"Now,\" said Jack, \"as our boat answers so well, we will get a mast and\nsail made immediately.\"\n\n\"So we will,\" cried Peterkin, as we all assisted to drag the boat above\nhigh-water mark; \"we'll light our candle and set about it this very\nnight.  Hurrah, my boys, pull away!\"\n\nAs we dragged our boat, we observed that she grated heavily on her keel;\nand, as the sands were in this place mingled with broken coral rocks, we\nsaw portions of the wood being scraped off.\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried Jack, on seeing this.  \"That won't do.  Our keel will be\nworn off in no time at this rate.\"\n\n\"So it will,\" said I, pondering deeply as to how this might be prevented.\nBut I am not of a mechanical turn, naturally, so I could conceive no\nremedy save that of putting a plate of iron on the keel, but as we had no\niron I knew not what was to be done.  \"It seems to me, Jack,\" I added,\n\"that it is impossible to prevent the keel being worn off thus.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Peterkin, \"my dear Ralph, you are mistaken, there is\nnothing so easy--\"\n\n\"How?\" I inquired, in some surprise.\n\n\"Why, by not using the boat at all!\" replied Peterkin.\n\n\"Hold your impudent tongue, Peterkin,\" said Jack, as he shouldered the\noars, \"come along with me and I'll give you work to do.  In the first\nplace, you will go and collect cocoa-nut fibre, and set to work to make\nsewing twine with it--\"\n\n\"Please, captain,\" interrupted Peterkin, \"I've got lots of it made\nalready,--more than enough, as a little friend of mine used to be in the\nhabit of saying every day after dinner.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" continued Jack; \"then you'll help Ralph to collect cocoa-nut\ncloth, and cut it into shape, after which we'll make a sail of it.  I'll\nsee to getting the mast and the gearing; so let's to work.\"\n\nAnd to work we went right busily, so that in three days from that time we\nhad set up a mast and sail, with the necessary rigging, in our little\nboat.  The sail was not, indeed, very handsome to look at, as it was\nformed of a number of oblong patches of cloth; but we had sewed it well\nby means of our sail-needle, so that it was strong, which was the chief\npoint.  Jack had also overcome the difficulty about the keel, by pinning\nto it a _false_ keel.  This was a piece of tough wood, of the same length\nand width as the real keel, and about five inches deep.  He made it of\nthis depth because the boat would be thereby rendered not only much more\nsafe, but more able to beat against the wind; which, in a sea where the\ntrade-winds blow so long and so steadily in one direction, was a matter\nof great importance.  This piece of wood was pegged very firmly to the\nkeel; and we now launched our boat with the satisfaction of knowing that\nwhen the false keel should be scraped off we could easily put on another;\nwhereas, should the real keel have been scraped away, we could not have\nrenewed it without taking our boat to pieces, which Peterkin said made\nhis \"marrow quake to think upon.\"\n\nThe mast and sail answered excellently; and we now sailed about in the\nlagoon with great delight, and examined with much interest the appearance\nof our island from a distance.  Also, we gazed into the depths of the\nwater, and watched for hours the gambols of the curious and\nbright-coloured fish among the corals and sea-weed.  Peterkin also made a\nfishing line, and Jack constructed a number of hooks, some of which were\nvery good, others remarkably bad.  Some of these hooks were made of iron-\nwood, which did pretty well, the wood being extremely hard, and Jack made\nthem very thick and large.  Fish there are not particular.  Some of the\ncrooked bones in fish-heads also answered for this purpose pretty well.\nBut that which formed our best and most serviceable hook was the brass\nfinger-ring belonging to Jack.  It gave him not a little trouble to\nmanufacture it.  First he cut it with the axe; then twisted it into the\nform of a hook.  The barb took him several hours to cut.  He did it by\nmeans of constant sawing with the broken pen-knife.  As for the point, an\nhour's rubbing on a piece of sandstone made an excellent one.\n\nIt would be a matter of much time and labour to describe the appearance\nof the multitudes of fish that were day after day drawn into our boat by\nmeans of the brass hook.  Peterkin always caught them,--for we observed\nthat he derived much pleasure from fishing,--while Jack and I found ample\namusement in looking on, also in gazing down at the coral groves, and in\nbaiting the hook.  Among the fish that we saw, but did not catch, were\nporpoises and sword-fish, whales and sharks.  The porpoises came\nfrequently into our lagoon in shoals, and amused us not a little by their\nbold leaps into the air, and their playful gambols in the sea.  The sword-\nfish were wonderful creatures; some of them apparently ten feet in\nlength, with an ivory spear, six or eight feet long, projecting from\ntheir noses.  We often saw them darting after other fish, and no doubt\nthey sometimes killed them with their ivory swords.  Jack remembered\nhaving heard once of a sword-fish attacking a ship,--which seemed strange\nindeed; but, as they are often in the habit of attacking whales, perhaps\nit mistook the ship for one.  This sword-fish ran against the vessel with\nsuch force, that it drove its sword quite through the thick planks; and\nwhen the ship arrived in harbour, long afterwards, the sword was found\nstill sticking in it!\n\nSharks did not often appear; but we took care never again to bathe in\ndeep water without leaving one of our number in the boat to give us\nwarning, if he should see a shark approaching.  As for the whales, they\nnever came into our lagoon, but we frequently saw them spouting in the\ndeep water beyond the reef.  I shall never forget my surprise the first\nday I saw one of these huge monsters close to me.  We had been rambling\nabout on the reef during the morning, and were about to re-embark in our\nlittle boat, to return home, when a loud blowing sound caused us to wheel\nrapidly round.  We were just in time to see a shower of spray falling,\nand the flukes or tail of some monstrous fish disappear in the sea a few\nhundred yards off.  We waited some time to see if he would rise again.  As\nwe stood, the sea seemed to open up at our very feet; an immense spout of\nwater was sent with a snort high into the air, and the huge blunt head of\na sperm whale arose before us.  It was so large that it could easily have\ntaken our little boat, along with ourselves, into its mouth!  It plunged\nslowly back into the sea, like a large ship foundering, and struck the\nwater with its tail so forcibly as to cause a sound like a cannon shot.\nWe also saw a great number of flying fish, although we caught none; and\nwe noticed that they never flew out of the water except when followed by\ntheir bitter foe, the dolphin, from whom they thus endeavoured to escape.\nBut of all the fish that we saw, none surprised us so much as those that\nwe used to find in shallow pools after a shower of rain; and this not on\naccount of their appearance, for they were ordinary-looking and very\nsmall, but on account of their having descended in a shower of rain!  We\ncould account for them in no other way, because the pools in which we\nfound these fish were quite dry before the shower, and at some distance\nabove high-water mark.  Jack, however, suggested a cause which seemed to\nme very probable.  We used often to see water-spouts in the sea.  A water-\nspout is a whirling body of water, which rises from the sea like a sharp-\npointed pillar.  After rising a good way, it is met by a long tongue,\nwhich comes down from the clouds; and when the two have joined, they look\nsomething like an hour-glass.  The water-spout is then carried by the\nwind, sometimes gently, sometimes with violence, over the sea, sometimes\nup into the clouds, and then, bursting asunder, it descends in a deluge.\nThis often happens over the land as well as over the sea; and it\nsometimes does much damage, but frequently it passes gently away.  Now,\nJack thought that the little fish might perhaps have been carried up in a\nwater-spout, and so sent down again in a shower of rain.  But we could\nnot be certain as to this point; yet we thought it likely.\n\nDuring these delightful fishing and boating excursions we caught a good\nmany eels, which we found to be very good to eat.  We also found turtles\namong the coral rocks, and made excellent soup in our iron kettle.\nMoreover, we discovered many shrimps and prawns, so that we had no lack\nof variety in our food; and, indeed, we never passed a week without\nmaking some new and interesting discovery of some sort or other, either\non the land or in the sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nA monster wave and its consequences--The boat lost and found--Peterkin's\nterrible accident--Supplies of food for a voyage in the boat--We visit\nPenguin Island, and are amazed beyond measure--Account of the penguins.\n\nOne day, not long after our little boat was finished, we were sitting on\nthe rocks at Spouting Cliff, and talking of an excursion which we\nintended to make to Penguin Island the next day.\n\n\"You see,\" said Peterkin, \"it might be all very well for a stupid fellow\nlike me to remain here and leave the penguins alone, but it would be\nquite inconsistent with your characters as philosophers to remain any\nlonger in ignorance of the habits and customs of these birds; so the\nsooner we go the better.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said I; \"there is nothing I desire so much as to have a\ncloser inspection of them.\"\n\n\"And I think,\" said Jack, \"that you had better remain at home, Peterkin,\nto take care of the cat; for I'm sure the hogs will be at it in your\nabsence, out of revenge for your killing their great-grandmother so\nrecklessly.\"\n\n\"Stay at home?\" cried Peterkin; \"my dear fellow, you would certainly lose\nyour way, or get upset, if I were not there to take care of you.\"\n\n\"Ah, true,\" said Jack, gravely, \"that did not occur to me; no doubt you\nmust go.  Our boat does require a good deal of ballast; and all that you\nsay, Peterkin, carries so much weight with it, that we won't need stones\nif you go.\"\n\nNow, while my companions were talking, a notable event occurred, which,\nas it is not generally known, I shall be particular in recording here.\n\nWhile we were talking, as I have said, we noticed a dark line, like a low\ncloud or fog-bank, on the seaward horizon.  The day was a fine one,\nthough cloudy, and a gentle breeze was blowing, but the sea was not\nrougher, or the breaker on the reef higher, than usual.  At first we\nthought that this looked like a thunder-cloud; and, as we had had a good\ndeal of broken weather of late, accompanied by occasional peals of\nthunder, we supposed that a storm must be approaching.  Gradually,\nhowever, this line seemed to draw nearer, without spreading up over the\nsky, as would certainly have been the case if it had been a storm-cloud.\nStill nearer it came, and soon we saw that it was moving swiftly towards\nthe island; but there was no sound till it reached the islands out at\nsea.  As it passed these islands, we observed, with no little anxiety,\nthat a cloud of white foam encircled them, and burst in spray into the\nair: it was accompanied by a loud roar.  This led us to conjecture that\nthe approaching object was an enormous wave of the sea; but we had no\nidea how large it was till it came near to ourselves.  When it approached\nthe outer reef, however, we were awe-struck with its unusual magnitude;\nand we sprang to our feet, and clambered hastily up to the highest point\nof the precipice, under an indefinable feeling of fear.\n\nI have said before that the reef opposite Spouting Cliff was very near to\nthe shore, while, just in front of the bower, it was at a considerable\ndistance out to sea.  Owing to this formation, the wave reached the reef\nat the latter point before it struck at the foot of Spouting Cliff.  The\ninstant it touched the reef we became aware, for the first time, of its\nawful magnitude.  It burst completely over the reef at all points, with a\nroar that seemed louder to me than thunder; and this roar continued for\nsome seconds, while the wave rolled gradually along towards the cliff on\nwhich we stood.  As its crest reared before us, we felt that we were in\ngreat danger, and turned to flee; but we were too late.  With a crash\nthat seemed to shake the solid rocks the gigantic billow fell, and\ninstantly the spouting-holes sent up a gush of water-spouts with such\nforce that they shrieked on issuing from their narrow vents.  It seemed\nto us as if the earth had been blown up with water.  We were stunned and\nconfused by the shock, and so drenched and blinded with spray, that we\nknew not for a few moments whither to flee for shelter.  At length we all\nthree gained an eminence beyond the reach of the water; but what a scene\nof devastation met our gaze as we looked along the shore!  This enormous\nwave not only burst over the reef, but continued its way across the\nlagoon, and fell on the sandy beach of the island with such force that\npassed completely over it and dashed into the woods, levelling the\nsmaller trees and bushes in its headlong course!\n\nOn seeing this, Jack said he feared our bower must have been swept away,\nand that the boat, which was on the beach, must have been utterly\ndestroyed.  Our hearts sank within us as we thought of this, and we\nhastened round through the woods towards our home.  On reaching it we\nfound, to our great relief of mind, that the force of the wave had been\nexpended just before reaching the bower; but the entrance to it was\nalmost blocked up by the torn-up bushes and tangled heaps of sea-weed.\nHaving satisfied ourselves as to the bower, we hurried to the spot where\nthe boat had been left; but no boat was there!  The spot on which it had\nstood was vacant, and no sign of it could we see on looking around us.\n\n\"It may have been washed up into the woods,\" said Jack, hurrying up the\nbeach as he spoke.  Still, no boat was to be seen, and we were about to\ngive ourselves over to despair, when Peterkin called to Jack and said,--\n\n\"Jack, my friend, you were once so exceedingly sagacious and wise as to\nmake me acquainted with the fact that cocoa nuts grow upon trees; will\nyou now be so good as to inform me what sort of fruit that is growing on\nthe top of yonder bush? for I confess to being ignorant, or, at least,\ndoubtful on the point.\"\n\nWe looked towards the bush indicated, and there, to our surprise, beheld\nour little boat snugly nestled among the leaves!  We were very much\noverjoyed at this, for we would have suffered any loss rather than the\nloss of our boat.  We found that the wave had actually borne the boat on\nits crest from the beach into the woods, and there launched it into the\nheart of this bush; which was extremely fortunate, for had it been tossed\nagainst a rock or a tree, it would have been dashed to pieces, whereas it\nhad not received the smallest injury.  It was no easy matter, however, to\nget it out of the bush and down to the sea again.  This cost us two days\nof hard labour to accomplish.\n\nWe had also much ado to clear away the rubbish from before the bower, and\nspent nearly a week in constant labour ere we got the neighbourhood to\nlook as clean and orderly as before; for the uprooted bushes and sea-weed\nthat lay on the beach formed a more dreadfully confused-looking mass than\none who had not seen the place after the inundation could conceive.\n\nBefore leaving the subject I may mention, for the sake of those who\ninterest themselves in the curious natural phenomena of our world, that\nthis gigantic wave occurs regularly on some of the islands of the\nPacific, once, and sometimes twice in the year.  I heard this stated by\nthe missionaries during my career in those seas.  They could not tell me\nwhether it visited all of the islands, but I was certainly assured that\nit occurred periodically in some of them.\n\nAfter we had got our home put to rights and cleared of the _debris_ of\nthe inundation, we again turned our thoughts to paying the penguins a\nvisit.  The boat was therefore overhauled and a few repairs done.  Then\nwe prepared a supply of provisions, for we intended to be absent at least\na night or two, perhaps longer.  This took us some time to do, for while\nJack was busy with the boat, Peterkin was sent into the woods to spear a\nhog or two, and had to search long, sometimes, ere he found them.\nPeterkin was usually sent on this errand, when we wanted a pork chop\n(which was not seldom), because he was so active, and could run so\nwonderfully fast that he found no difficulty in overtaking the hogs; but,\nbeing dreadfully reckless, he almost invariably tumbled over stumps and\nstones in the course of his wild chase, and seldom returned home without\nhaving knocked the skin off his shins.  Once, indeed, a more serious\naccident happened to him.  He had been out all morning alone and did not\nreturn at the usual time to dinner.  We wondered at this, for Peterkin\nwas always very punctual at the dinner hour.  As supper-time drew near we\nbegan to be anxious about him, and at length sallied forth to search the\nwoods.  For a long time we sought in vain, but a little before dark we\ncame upon the tracks of the hogs, which we followed up until we came to\nthe brow of a rather steep bank or precipice.  Looking over this we\nbeheld Peterkin lying in a state of insensibility at the foot, with his\ncheek resting on the snout of a little pig, which was pinned to the earth\nby the spear!  We were dreadfully alarmed, but hastened to bathe his\nforehead with water, and had soon the satisfaction of seeing him revive.\nAfter we had carried him home he related to as how the thing had\nhappened.\n\n\"You must know,\" said he, \"I walked about all the forenoon, till I was as\ntired as an old donkey, without seeing a single grunter, not so much as a\ntrack of one; but, as I was determined not to return empty-handed, I\nresolved to go without my dinner and--\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Jack, \"did you _really_ resolve to do that?\"\n\n\"Now, Jack, hold your tongue,\" returned Peterkin; \"I say that I resolved\nto forego my dinner and to push to the head of the small valley, where I\nfelt pretty sure of discovering the hogs.  I soon found that I was on the\nright scent, for I had scarcely walked half a mile in the direction of\nthe small plum tree we found there the other day, when a squeak fell on\nmy ear.  'Ho, ho,' said I, 'there you go, my boys;' and I hurried up the\nglen.  I soon started them, and singling out a fat pig, ran tilt at him.\nIn a few seconds I was up with him, and stuck my spear right through his\ndumpy body.  Just as I did so, I saw that we were on the edge of a\nprecipice, whether high or low I knew not, but I had been running at such\na pace that I could not stop, so the pig and I gave a howl in concert and\nwent plunging over together.  I remembered nothing more after that, till\nI came to my senses and found you bathing my temples, and Ralph wringing\nhis hands over me.\"\n\nBut although Peterkin was often unfortunate, in the way of getting\ntumbles, he was successful on the present occasion in hunting, and\nreturned before evening with three very nice little hogs.  I, also, was\nsuccessful in my visit to the mud-flats, where I killed several ducks.  So\nthat, when we launched and loaded our boat at sunrise the following\nmorning, we found our store of provisions to be more than sufficient.\nPart had been cooked the night before, and, on taking note of the\ndifferent items, we found the account to stand thus:--\n\n10 Bread-fruits, (two baked, eight unbaked.)\n20 Yams, (six roasted, the rest raw.)\n6 Taro roots.\n50 Fine large plums.\n6 Cocoa nuts, ripe.\n6 Ditto green, (for drinking.)\n4 Large ducks and two small ones, raw.\n3 Cold roast pigs, with stuffing.\n\nI may here remark that the stuffing had been devised by Peterkin\nspecially for the occasion.  He kept the manner of its compounding a\nprofound secret, so I cannot tell what it was; but I can say, with much\nconfidence, that we found it to be atrociously bad, and, after the first\ntasting, scraped it carefully out and threw it overboard.  We calculated\nthat this supply would last us for several days, but we afterwards found\nthat it was much more than we required, especially in regard to the cocoa\nnuts, of which we found large supplies wherever we went.  However, as\nPeterkin remarked, it was better to have too much than too little, as we\nknew not to what straits we might be put during our voyage.\n\nIt was a very calm sunny morning when we launched forth and rowed over\nthe lagoon towards the outlet in the reef, and passed between the two\ngreen islets that guard the entrance.  We experienced some difficulty and\nno little danger in passing the surf of the breaker, and shipped a good\ndeal of water in the attempt; but, once past the billow, we found\nourselves floating placidly on the long oily swell that rose and fell\nslowly as it rolled over the wide ocean.\n\nPenguin Island lay on the other side of our own island, at about a mile\nbeyond the outer reef, and we calculated that it must be at least twenty\nmiles distant by the way we should have to go.  We might, indeed, have\nshortened the way by coasting round our island inside of the lagoon, and\ngoing out at the passage in the reef nearly opposite to Penguin Island,\nbut we preferred to go by the open sea; first, because it was more\nadventurous; and, secondly, because we should have the pleasure of again\nfeeling the motion of the deep, which we all loved very much, not being\nliable to sea sickness.\n\n\"I wish we had a breeze,\" said Jack.\n\n\"So do I,\" cried Peterkin, resting on his oar and wiping his heated brow;\n\"pulling is hard work.  Oh dear, if we could only catch a hundred or two\nof these gulls, tie them to the boat with long strings, and make them fly\nas we want them, how capital it would be!\"\n\n\"Or bore a hole through a shark's tail, and reeve a rope through it, eh?\"\nremarked Jack.  \"But, I say, it seems that my wish is going to be\ngranted, for here comes a breeze.  Ship your oar, Peterkin.  Up with the\nmast, Ralph; I'll see to the sail.  Mind your helm; look out for\nsqualls!\"\n\nThis last speech was caused by the sudden appearance of a dark blue line\non the horizon, which, in an incredibly short space of time, swept down\non us, lashing up the sea in white foam as it went.  We presented the\nstern of the boat to its first violence, and, in a few seconds, it\nmoderated into a steady breeze, to which we spread our sail and flew\nmerrily over the waves.  Although the breeze died away soon afterwards,\nit had been so stiff while it lasted, that we were carried over the\ngreater part of our way before it fell calm again; so that, when the\nflapping of the sail against the mast told us that it was time to resume\nthe oars, we were not much more than a mile from Penguin Island.\n\n\"There go the soldiers!\" cried Peterkin as we came in sight of it; \"how\nspruce their white trousers look, this morning!  I wonder if they will\nreceive us kindly.  D'you think they are hospitable, Jack?\"\n\n\"Don't talk, Peterkin, but pull away, and you shall see shortly.\"\n\nAs we drew near to the island we were much amused by the manoeuvres and\nappearance of these strange birds.  They seemed to be of different\nspecies, for some had crests on their heads while others had none, and\nwhile some were about the size of a goose others appeared nearly as large\nas a swan.  We also saw a huge albatross soaring above the heads of the\npenguins.  It was followed and surrounded by numerous flocks of\nsea-gulls.  Having approached to within a few yards of the island, which\nwas a low rock, with no other vegetation on it than a few bushes, we lay\non our oars and gazed at the birds with surprise and pleasure, they\nreturning our gaze with interest.  We now saw that their soldier-like\nappearance was owing to the stiff, erect manner in which they sat on\ntheir short legs,--\"Bolt-up-right,\" as Peterkin expressed it.  They had\nblack heads, long sharp beaks, white breasts, and bluish backs.  Their\nwings were so short that they looked more like the fins of a fish, and,\nindeed, we soon saw that they used them for the purpose of swimming under\nwater.  There were no quills on these wings, but a sort of scaly\nfeathers; which also thickly covered their bodies.  Their legs were\nshort, and placed so far back that the birds, while on land, were obliged\nto stand quite upright in order to keep their balance; but in the water\nthey floated like other water-fowl.  At first we were so stunned with the\nclamour which they and other sea-birds kept up around us, that we knew\nnot which way to look,--for they covered the rocks in thousands; but, as\nwe continued to gaze, we observed several quadrupeds (as we thought)\nwalking in the midst of the penguins.\n\n\"Pull in a bit,\" cried Peterkin, \"and let's see what these are.  They\nmust be fond of noisy company, to consort with such creatures.\"\n\nTo our surprise we found that these were no other than penguins which had\ngone down on all fours, and were crawling among the bushes on their feet\nand wings, just like quadrupeds.  Suddenly one big old bird, that had\nbeen sitting on a point very near to us, gazing in mute astonishment,\nbecame alarmed, and, scuttling down the rocks, plumped or fell, rather\nthan ran, into the sea.  It dived in a moment, and, a few seconds\nafterwards, came out of the water far a-head, with such a spring, and\nsuch a dive back into the sea again, that we could scarcely believe it\nwas not a fish that had leaped in sport.\n\n\"That beats everything,\" said Peterkin, rubbing his nose, and screwing up\nhis face with an expression of exasperated amazement.  \"I've heard of a\nthing being neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, but I never did expect to live\nto see a brute that was all three together,--at once--in one!  But look\nthere!\" he continued, pointing with a look of resignation to the shore,\n\"look there! there's no end to it.  What _has_ that brute got under its\ntail?\"\n\nWe turned to look in the direction pointed out, and there saw a penguin\nwalking slowly and very sedately along the shore with an egg under its\ntail.  There were several others, we observed, burdened in the same way;\nand we found afterwards that these were a species of penguins that always\ncarried their eggs so.  Indeed, they had a most convenient cavity for the\npurpose, just between the tail and the legs.  We were very much impressed\nwith the regularity and order of this colony.  The island seemed to be\napportioned out into squares, of which each penguin possessed one, and\nsat in stiff solemnity in the middle of it, or took a slow march up and\ndown the spaces between.  Some were hatching their eggs, but others were\nfeeding their young ones in a manner that caused us to laugh not a\nlittle.  The mother stood on a mound or raised rock, while the young one\nstood patiently below her on the ground.  Suddenly the mother raised her\nhead and uttered a series of the most discordant cackling sounds.\n\n\"She's going to choke,\" cried Peterkin.\n\nBut this was not the case, although, I confess, she looked like it.  In a\nfew seconds she put down her head and opened her mouth, into which the\nyoung one thrust its beak and seemed to suck something from her throat.\nThen the cackling was renewed, the sucking continued, and so the\noperation of feeding was carried on till the young one was satisfied; but\nwhat she fed her little one with, we could not tell.\n\n\"Now, just look yonder!\" said Peterkin, in an excited tone; \"if that\nisn't the most abominable piece of maternal deception I ever saw.  That\nrascally old lady penguin has just pitched her young one into the sea,\nand there's another about to follow her example.\"\n\nThis indeed seemed to be the cue, for, on the top of a steep rock close\nto the edge of the sea, we observed an old penguin endeavouring to entice\nher young one into the water; but the young one seemed very unwilling to\ngo, and, notwithstanding the enticements of its mother, moved very slowly\ntowards her.  At last she went gently behind the young bird and pushed it\na little towards the water, but with great tenderness, as much as to say,\n'Don't be afraid, darling!  I won't hurt you, my pet!' but no sooner did\nshe get it to the edge of the rock, where it stood looking pensively down\nat the sea, than she gave it a sudden and violent push, sending it\nheadlong down the slope into the water, where its mother left it to\nscramble ashore as it best could.  We observed many of them employed in\ndoing this, and we came to the conclusion that this is the way in which\nold penguins teach their children to swim.\n\nScarcely had we finished making our remarks on this, when we were\nstartled by about a dozen of the old birds hopping in the most clumsy and\nludicrous manner towards the sea.  The beach, here, was a sloping rock,\nand when they came to it, some of them succeeded in hopping down in\nsafety, but others lost their balance and rolled and scrambled down the\nslope in the most helpless manner.  The instant they reached the water,\nhowever, they seemed to be in their proper element.  They dived and\nbounded out of it and into it again with the utmost agility; and so,\ndiving and bounding and spluttering, for they could not fly, they went\nrapidly out to sea.\n\nOn seeing this, Peterkin turned with a grave face to us and said, \"It's\nmy opinion that these birds are all stark, staring mad, and that this is\nan enchanted island.  I therefore propose that we should either put about\nship and fly in terror from the spot, or land valorously on the island,\nand sell our lives as dearly as we can.\"\n\n\"I vote for landing, so pull in, lads,\" said Jack, giving a stroke with\nhis oar that made the boat spin.  In a few seconds we ran the boat into a\nlittle creek where we made her fast to a projecting piece of coral, and,\nrunning up the beach, entered the ranks of the penguins armed with our\ncudgels and our spear.  We were greatly surprised to find that, instead\nof attacking us or showing signs of fear at our approach, these curious\nbirds did not move from their places until we laid hands on them, and\nmerely turned their eyes on us in solemn, stupid wonder as we passed.\nThere was one old penguin, however, that began to walk slowly toward the\nsea, and Peterkin took it into his head that he would try to interrupt\nits progress, so he ran between it and the sea and brandished his cudgel\nin its face.  But this proved to be a resolute old bird.  It would not\nretreat; nay, more, it would not cease to advance, but battled with\nPeterkin bravely and drove him before it until it reached the sea.  Had\nPeterkin used his club he could easily have felled it, no doubt; but, as\nhe had no wish to do so cruel an act merely out of sport, he let the bird\nescape.\n\nWe spent fully three hours on this island in watching the habits of these\ncurious birds, and, when we finally left them, we all three concluded,\nafter much consultation, that they were the most wonderful creatures we\nhad ever seen; and further, we thought it probable that they were the\nmost wonderful creatures in the world!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nAn awful storm and its consequences--Narrow escape--A rock proves a sure\nfoundation--A fearful night and a bright morning--Deliverance from\ndanger.\n\nIt was evening before we left the island of the penguins.  As we had made\nup our minds to encamp for the night on a small island, whereon grew a\nfew cocoa-nut trees, which was about two miles off, we lay to our oars\nwith some energy.  But a danger was in store for us which we had not\nanticipated.  The wind, which had carried us so quickly to Penguin\nIsland, freshened as evening drew on, to a stiff breeze, and, before we\nhad made half the distance to the small island, it became a regular gale.\nAlthough it was not so directly against us as to prevent our rowing in\nthe course we wished to go, yet it checked us very much; and although the\nforce of the sea was somewhat broken by the island, the waves soon began\nto rise, and to roll their broken crests against our small craft, so that\nshe began to take in water, and we had much ado to keep ourselves afloat.\nAt last the wind and sea together became so violent that we found it\nimpossible to make the island, so Jack suddenly put the head of the boat\nround and ordered Peterkin and me to hoist a corner of the sail,\nintending to run back to Penguin Island.\n\n\"We shall at least have the shelter of the bushes,\" he said, as the boat\nflew before the wind, \"and the penguins will keep us company.\"\n\nAs Jack spoke, the wind suddenly shifted, and blew so much against us\nthat we were forced to hoist more of the sail in order to beat up for the\nisland, being by this change thrown much to leeward of it.  What made\nmatters worse was, that the gale came in squalls, so that we were more\nthan once nearly upset.\n\n\"Stand by, both of you,\" cried Jack, in a quick, earnest tone; \"be ready\nto dowse the sail.  I very much fear we won't make the island after all.\"\n\nPeterkin and I were so much in the habit of trusting everything to Jack\nthat we had fallen into the way of not considering things, especially\nsuch things as were under Jack's care.  We had, therefore, never doubted\nfor a moment that all was going well, so that it was with no little\nanxiety that we heard him make the above remark.  However, we had no time\nfor question or surmise, for, at the moment he spoke, a heavy squall was\nbearing down upon us, and, as we were then flying with our lee gunwale\ndipping occasionally under the waves, it was evident that we should have\nto lower our sail altogether.  In a few seconds the squall struck the\nboat, but Peterkin and I had the sail down in a moment, so that it did\nnot upset us; but, when it was past, we were more than half full of\nwater.  This I soon baled out, while Peterkin again hoisted a corner of\nthe sail; but the evil which Jack had feared came upon us.  We found it\nquite impossible to make Penguin Island.  The gale carried us quickly\npast it towards the open sea, and the terrible truth flashed upon us that\nwe should be swept out and left to perish miserably in a small boat in\nthe midst of the wide ocean.\n\nThis idea was forced very strongly upon us because we saw nothing in the\ndirection whither the wind was blowing us save the raging billows of the\nsea; and, indeed, we trembled as we gazed around us, for we were now\nbeyond the shelter of the islands, and it seemed as though any of the\nhuge billows, which curled over in masses of foam, might swallow us up in\na moment.  The water, also, began to wash in over our sides, and I had to\nkeep constantly baling, for Jack could not quit the helm nor Peterkin the\nsail for an instant, without endangering our lives.  In the midst of this\ndistress Jack uttered an exclamation of hope, and pointed towards a low\nisland or rock which lay directly ahead.  It had been hitherto\nunobserved, owing to the dark clouds that obscured the sky and the\nblinding spray that seemed to fill the whole atmosphere.\n\nAs we neared this rock we observed that it was quite destitute of trees\nand verdure, and so low that the sea broke completely over it.  In fact\nit was nothing more than the summit of one of the coral formations, which\nrose only a few feet above the level of the water, and was, in stormy\nweather, all but invisible.  Over this island the waves were breaking in\nthe utmost fury, and our hearts sank within us as we saw that there was\nnot a spot where we could thrust our little boat without its being dashed\nto pieces.\n\n\"Show a little bit more sail,\" cried Jack, as we swept past the weather\nside of the rock with fearful speed.\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" answered Peterkin, hoisting about a foot more of our sail.\n\nLittle though the addition was it caused the boat to lie over and creak\nso loudly, as we cleft the foaming waves, that I expected to be upset\nevery instant; and I blamed Jack in my heart for his rashness.  But I did\nhim injustice, for, although during two seconds the water rushed in-board\nin a torrent, he succeeded in steering us sharply round to the leeward\nside of the rock, where the water was comparatively calm, and the force\nof the breeze broken.\n\n\"Out your oars now, lads; that's well done.  Give way!\"  We obeyed\ninstantly.  The oars splashed into the waves together.  One good hearty\npull, and we were floating in a comparatively calm creek that was so\nnarrow as to be barely able to admit our boat.  Here we were in perfect\nsafety, and, as we leaped on shore and fastened our cable to the rocks, I\nthanked God in my heart for our deliverance from so great danger.  But,\nalthough I have said we were now in safety, I suspect that few of my\nreaders would have envied our position.  It is true we had no lack of\nfood, but we were drenched to the skin; the sea was foaming round us and\nthe spray flying over our heads, so that we were completely enveloped, as\nit were, in water; the spot on which we had landed was not more than\ntwelve yards in diameter, and from this spot we could not move without\nthe risk of being swept away by the storm.  At the upper end of the creek\nwas a small hollow or cave in the rock, which sheltered us from the fury\nof the winds and waves; and as the rock extended in a sort of ledge over\nour heads, it prevented the spray from falling upon us.\n\n\"Why,\" said Peterkin, beginning to feel cheery again, \"it seems to me\nthat we have got into a mermaid's cave, for there is nothing but water\nall round us; and as for earth or sky, they are things of the past.\"\n\nPeterkin's idea was not inappropriate, for, what with the sea roaring in\nwhite foam up to our very feet, and the spray flying in white sheets\ncontinually over our heads, and the water dripping heavily from the ledge\nabove like a curtain in front of our cave, it did seem to us very much\nmore like being below than above water.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" cried Jack, \"bestir yourselves, and let's make ourselves\ncomfortable.  Toss out our provisions, Peterkin; and here, Ralph, lend a\nhand to haul up the boat.  Look sharp.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, captain,\" we cried, as we hastened to obey, much cheered by the\nhearty manner of our comrade.\n\nFortunately the cave, although not very deep, was quite dry, so that we\nsucceeded in making ourselves much more comfortable than could have been\nexpected.  We landed our provisions, wrung the water out of our garments,\nspread our sail below us for a carpet, and, after having eaten a hearty\nmeal, began to feel quite cheerful.  But as night drew on, our spirits\nsank again, for with the daylight all evidence of our security vanished\naway.  We could no longer see the firm rock on which we lay, while we\nwere stunned with the violence of the tempest that raged around us.  The\nnight grew pitchy dark, as it advanced, so that we could not see our\nhands when we held them up before our eyes, and were obliged to feel each\nother occasionally to make sure that we were safe, for the storm at last\nbecame so terrible that it was difficult to make our voices audible.  A\nslight variation of the wind, as we supposed, caused a few drops of spray\never and anon to blow into our faces; and the eddy of the sea, in its mad\nboiling, washed up into our little creek until it reached our feet and\nthreatened to tear away our boat.  In order to prevent this latter\ncalamity, we hauled the boat farther up and held the cable in our hands.\nOccasional flashes of lightning shone with a ghastly glare through the\nwatery curtains around us, and lent additional horror to the scene.  Yet\nwe longed for those dismal flashes, for they were less appalling than the\nthick blackness that succeeded them.  Crashing peals of thunder seemed to\ntear the skies in twain, and fell upon our ears through the wild yelling\nof the hurricane as if it had been but a gentle summer breeze; while the\nbillows burst upon the weather side of the island until we fancied that\nthe solid rock was giving way, and, in our agony, we clung to the bare\nground, expecting every moment to be whirled away and whelmed in the\nblack howling sea!  Oh! it was a night of terrible anxiety, and no one\ncan conceive the feelings of intense gratitude and relief with which we\nat last saw the dawn of day break through the vapory mists around us.\n\nFor three days and three nights we remained on this rock, while the storm\ncontinued to rage with unabated fury.  On the morning of the fourth day\nit suddenly ceased, and the wind fell altogether; but the waves still ran\nso high that we did not dare to put off in our boat.  During the greater\npart of this period we scarcely slept above a few minutes at a time, but\non the third night we slept soundly and awoke early on the fourth morning\nto find the sea very much down, and the sun shining brightly again in the\nclear blue sky.\n\nIt was with light hearts that we launched forth once more in our little\nboat and steered away for our island home, which, we were overjoyed to\nfind, was quite visible on the horizon, for we had feared that we had\nbeen blown out of sight of it altogether.  As it was a dead calm we had\nto row during the greater part of the day; but towards the afternoon a\nfair breeze sprang up, which enabled us to hoist our sail.  We soon\npassed Penguin Island, and the other island which we had failed to reach\non the day the storm commenced; but as we had still enough of provisions,\nand were anxious to get home, we did not land, to the great\ndisappointment of Peterkin, who seemed to entertain quite an affection\nfor the penguins.\n\nAlthough the breeze was pretty fresh for several hours, we did not reach\nthe outer reef of our island till night-fall, and before we had sailed\nmore than a hundred yards into the lagoon, the wind died away altogether,\nso that we had to take to our oars again.  It was late and the moon and\nstars were shining brightly when we arrived opposite the bower and leaped\nupon the strand.  So glad were we to be safe back again on our beloved\nisland, that we scarcely took time to drag the boat a short way up the\nbeach, and then ran up to see that all was right at the bower.  I must\nconfess, however, that my joy was mingled with a vague sort of fear lest\nour home had been visited and destroyed during our absence; but on\nreaching it we found everything just as it had been left, and the poor\nblack cat curled up, sound asleep, on the coral table in front of our\nhumble dwelling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nShoemaking--The even tenor of our way suddenly interrupted--An unexpected\nvisit and an appalling battle--We all become warriors, and Jack proves\nhimself be a hero.\n\nFor many months after this we continued to live on our island in\nuninterrupted harmony and happiness.  Sometimes we went out a-fishing in\nthe lagoon, and sometimes went a-hunting in the woods, or ascended to the\nmountain top, by way of variety, although Peterkin always asserted that\nwe went for the purpose of hailing any ship that might chance to heave in\nsight.  But I am certain that none of us wished to be delivered from our\ncaptivity, for we were extremely happy, and Peterkin used to say that as\nwe were very young we should not feel the loss of a year or two.\nPeterkin, as I have said before, was thirteen years of age, Jack\neighteen, and I fifteen.  But Jack was very tall, strong, and manly for\nhis age, and might easily have been mistaken for twenty.\n\nThe climate was so beautiful that it seemed to be a perpetual summer, and\nas many of the fruit-trees continued to bear fruit and blossom all the\nyear round, we never wanted for a plentiful supply of food.  The hogs,\ntoo, seemed rather to increase than diminish, although Peterkin was very\nfrequent in his attacks on them with his spear.  If at any time we failed\nin finding a drove, we had only to pay a visit to the plum-tree before\nmentioned, where we always found a large family of them asleep under its\nbranches.\n\nWe employed ourselves very busily during this time in making various\ngarments of cocoa-nut cloth, as those with which we had landed were\nbeginning to be very ragged.  Peterkin also succeeded in making excellent\nshoes out of the skin of the old hog, in the following manner:--He first\ncut a piece of the hide, of an oblong form, a few inches longer than his\nfoot.  This he soaked in water, and, while it was wet, he sewed up one\nend of it, so as to form a rough imitation of that part of the heel of a\nshoe where the seam is.  This done, he bored a row of holes all round the\nedge of the piece of skin, through which a tough line was passed.  Into\nthe sewed-up part of this shoe he thrust his heel, then, drawing the\nstring tight, the edges rose up and overlapped his foot all round.  It is\ntrue there were a great many ill-looking puckers in these shoes, but we\nfound them very serviceable notwithstanding, and Jack came at last to\nprefer them to his long boots.  We ago made various other useful\narticles, which added to our comfort, and once or twice spoke of building\nus a house, but we had so great an affection for the bower, and, withal,\nfound it so serviceable, that we determined not to leave it, nor to\nattempt the building of a house, which, in such a climate, might turn out\nto be rather disagreeable than useful.\n\nWe often examined the pistol that we had found in the house on the other\nside of the island, and Peterkin wished much that we had powder and shot,\nas it would render pig-killing much easier; but, after all, we had become\nso expert in the use of our sling and bow and spear, that we were\nindependent of more deadly weapons.\n\nDiving in the Water Garden also continued to afford us as much pleasure\nas ever; and Peterkin began to be a little more expert in the water from\nconstant practice.  As for Jack and I, we began to feel as if water were\nour native element, and revelled in it with so much confidence and\ncomfort that Peterkin said he feared we would turn into fish some day,\nand swim off and leave him; adding, that he had been for a long time\nobserving that Jack was becoming more and more like a shark every day.\nWhereupon Jack remarked, that if he, Peterkin, were changed into a fish,\nhe would certainly turn into nothing better or bigger than a shrimp.  Poor\nPeterkin did not envy us our delightful excursions under water, except,\nindeed, when Jack would dive down to the bottom of the Water Garden, sit\ndown on a rock and look up and make faces at him.  Peterkin did feel\nenvious then, and often said he would give anything to be able to do\nthat.  I was much amused when Peterkin said this; for if he could only\nhave seen his own face when he happened to take a short dive, he would\nhave seen that Jack's was far surpassed by it.  The great difference\nbeing, however, that Jack made faces on purpose--Peterkin couldn't help\nit!\n\nNow, while we were engaged with these occupations and amusements, an\nevent occurred one day which was as unexpected as it was exceedingly\nalarming and very horrible.\n\nJack and I were sitting, as we were often wont to do, on the rocks at\nSpouting Cliff, and Peterkin was wringing the water from his garments,\nhaving recently fallen by accident into the sea,--a thing he was\nconstantly doing,--when our attention was suddenly arrested by two\nobjects which appeared on the horizon.\n\n\"What are yon, think you?\" I said, addressing Jack.\n\n\"I can't imagine,\" answered he; \"I've noticed them for some time, and\nfancied they were black sea-gulls, but the more I look at them the more I\nfeel convinced they are much larger than gulls.\"\n\n\"They seem to be coming towards us,\" said I.\n\n\"Hallo! what's wrong?\" inquired Peterkin, coming up.\n\n\"Look there,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Whales!\" cried Peterkin, shading his eyes with his hand.  \"No! eh! can\nthey be boats, Jack?\"\n\nOur hearts beat with excitement at the very thought of seeing human faces\nagain.\n\n\"I think you are about right, Peterkin;--but they seem to me to move\nstrangely for boats,\" said Jack, in a low tone, as if he were talking to\nhimself.\n\nI noticed that a shade of anxiety crossed Jack's countenance as he gazed\nlong and intently at the two objects, which were now nearing us fast.  At\nlast he sprang to his feet.  \"They are canoes, Ralph! whether war-canoes\nor not I cannot tell, but this I know, that all the natives of the South\nSea Islands are fierce cannibals, and they have little respect for\nstrangers.  We must hide if they land here, which I earnestly hope they\nwill not do.\"\n\nI was greatly alarmed at Jack's speech, but I confess I thought less of\nwhat he said than of the earnest, anxious manner in which he said it, and\nit was with very uncomfortable feelings that Peterkin and I followed him\nquickly into the woods.\n\n\"How unfortunate,\" said I, as we gained the shelter of the bushes, \"that\nwe have forgotten our arms.\"\n\n\"It matters not,\" said Jack; \"here are clubs enough and to spare.\"  As he\nspoke, he laid his hand on a bundle of stout poles of various sizes,\nwhich Peterkin's ever-busy hands had formed, during our frequent visits\nto the cliff, for no other purpose, apparently, than that of having\nsomething to do.\n\nWe each selected a stout club according to our several tastes, and lay\ndown behind a rock, whence we could see the canoes approach, without\nourselves being seen.  At first we made an occasional remark on their\nappearance, but after they entered the lagoon, and drew near the beach,\nwe ceased to speak, and gazed with intense interest at the scene before\nus.\n\nWe now observed that the foremost canoe was being chased by the other,\nand that it contained a few women and children, as well as men,--perhaps\nforty souls altogether; while the canoe which pursued it contained only\nmen.  They seemed to be about the same in number, but were better armed,\nand had the appearance of being a war party.  Both crews were paddling\nwith all their might, and it seemed as if the pursuers exerted themselves\nto overtake the natives ere they could land.  In this, however, they\nfailed.  The foremost canoe made for the beach close beneath the rocks\nbehind which we were concealed.  Their short paddles flashed like meteors\nin the water, and sent up a constant shower of spray.  The foam curled\nfrom the prow, and the eyes of the rowers glistened in their black faces\nas they strained every muscle of their naked bodies; nor did they relax\ntheir efforts till the canoe struck the beach with a violent shock; then,\nwith a shout of defiance, the whole party sprang, as if by magic, from\nthe canoe to the shore.  Three women, two of whom carried infants in\ntheir arms, rushed into the woods; and the men crowded to the water's\nedge, with stones in their hands, spears levelled, and clubs brandished,\nto resist the landing of their enemies.\n\nThe distance between the two canoes had been about half a mile, and, at\nthe great speed they were going, this was soon passed.  As the pursuers\nneared the shore, no sign of fear or hesitation was noticeable.  On they\ncame like a wild charger,--received but recked not of a shower of stones.\nThe canoe struck, and, with a yell that seemed to issue from the throats\nof incarnate fiends, they leaped into the water, and drove their enemies\nup the beach.\n\nThe battle that immediately ensued was frightful to behold.  Most of the\nmen wielded clubs of enormous size and curious shapes, with which they\ndashed out each other's brains.  As they were almost entirely naked, and\nhad to bound, stoop, leap, and run, in their terrible hand-to-hand\nencounters, they looked more like demons than human beings.  I felt my\nheart grow sick at the sight of this bloody battle, and would fain have\nturned away, but a species of fascination seemed to hold me down and glue\nmy eyes upon the combatants.  I observed that the attacking party was led\nby a most extraordinary being, who, from his size and peculiarity, I\nconcluded was a chief.  His hair was frizzed out to an enormous extent,\nso that it resembled a large turban.  It was of a light-yellow hue, which\nsurprised me much, for the man's body was as black as coal, and I felt\nconvinced that the hair must have been dyed.  He was tattooed from head\nto foot; and his face, besides being tattooed, was besmeared with red\npaint, and streaked with white.  Altogether, with his yellow turban-like\nhair, his Herculean black frame, his glittering eyes and white teeth, he\nseemed the most terrible monster I ever beheld.  He was very active in\nthe fight, and had already killed four men.\n\nSuddenly the yellow-haired chief was attacked by a man quite as strong\nand large as himself.  He flourished a heavy club something like an\neagle's beak at the point.  For a second or two these giants eyed each\nother warily, moving round and round, as if to catch each other at a\ndisadvantage, but seeing that nothing was to be gained by this caution,\nand that the loss of time might effectually turn the tide of battle\neither way, they apparently made up their minds to attack at the same\ninstant, for, with a wild shout and simultaneous spring, they swung their\nheavy clubs, which met with a loud report.  Suddenly the yellow-haired\nsavage tripped, his enemy sprang forward, the ponderous club was swung,\nbut it did not descend, for at that moment the savage was felled to the\nground by a stone from the hand of one who had witnessed his chief's\ndanger.  This was the turning-point in the battle.  The savages who\nlanded first turned and fled towards the bush, on seeing the fall of\ntheir chief.  But not one escaped.  They were all overtaken and felled to\nthe earth.  I saw, however, that they were not all killed.  Indeed, their\nenemies, now that they were conquered, seemed anxious to take them alive;\nand they succeeded in securing fifteen, whom they bound hand and foot\nwith cords, and, carrying them up into the woods, laid them down among\nthe bushes.  Here they left them, for what purpose I knew not, and\nreturned to the scene of the late battle, where the remnant of the party\nwere bathing their wounds.\n\nOut of the forty blacks that composed the attacking party, only twenty-\neight remained alive, two of whom were sent into the bush to hunt for the\nwomen and children.  Of the other party, as I have said, only ten\nsurvived, and these were lying bound and helpless on the grass.\n\nJack and Peterkin and I now looked at each other, and whispered our fears\nthat the savages might clamber up the rocks to search for fresh water,\nand so discover our place of concealment; but we were so much interested\nin watching their movements that we agreed to remain where we were; and,\nindeed, we could not easily have risen without exposing ourselves to\ndetection.  One of the savages now went up to the wood and soon returned\nwith a bundle of fire-wood, and we were not a little surprised to see him\nset fire to it by the very same means used by Jack the time we made our\nfirst fire,--namely, with the bow and drill.  When the fire was kindled,\ntwo of the party went again to the woods and returned with one of the\nbound men.  A dreadful feeling of horror crept over my heart, as the\nthought flashed upon me that they were going to burn their enemies.  As\nthey bore him to the fire my feelings almost overpowered me.  I gasped\nfor breath, and seizing my club, endeavoured to spring to my feet; but\nJack's powerful arm pinned me to the earth.  Next moment one of the\nsavages raised his club, and fractured the wretched creature's skull.  He\nmust have died instantly, and, strange though it may seem, I confess to a\nfeeling of relief when the deed was done, because I now knew that the\npoor savage could not be burned alive.  Scarcely had his limbs ceased to\nquiver when the monsters cut slices of flesh from his body, and, after\nroasting them slightly over the fire, devoured them.\n\nSuddenly there arose a cry from the woods, and, in a few seconds, the two\nsavages hastened towards the fire dragging the three women and their two\ninfants along with them.  One of those women was much younger than her\ncompanions, and we were struck with the modesty of her demeanour and the\ngentle expression of her face, which, although she had the flattish nose\nand thick lips of the others, was of a light-brown colour, and we\nconjectured that she must be of a different race.  She and her companions\nwore short petticoats and a kind of tippet on their shoulders.  Their\nhair was jet black, but instead of being long, was short and\ncurly,--though not woolly--somewhat like the hair of a young boy.  While\nwe gazed with interest and some anxiety at these poor creatures, the big\nchief advanced to one of the elder females and laid his hand upon the\nchild.  But the mother shrank from him, and clasping the little one to\nher bosom, uttered a wail of fear.  With a savage laugh, the chief tore\nthe child from her arms and tossed it into the sea.  A low groan burst\nfrom Jack's lips as we witnessed this atrocious act and heard the\nmother's shriek, as she fell insensible on the sand.  The rippling waves\nrolled the child on the beach, as if they refused to be a party in such a\nfoul murder, and we could observe that the little one still lived.\n\nThe young girl was now brought forward, and the chief addressed her; but\nalthough we heard his voice, and even the words distinctly, of course we\ncould not understand what he said.  The girl made no answer to his fierce\nquestions, and we saw by the way in which he pointed to the fire that he\nthreatened her life.\n\n\"Peterkin,\" said Jack in a hoarse whisper, \"have you got your knife?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Peterkin, whose face was pale as death.\n\n\"That will do.  Listen to me, and do my bidding quick.  Here is the small\nknife, Ralph.  Fly both of you through the bush, cut the cords that bind\nthe prisoners and set them free.  There! quick, ere it be too late.\"  Jack\nsprang up, and seized a heavy but short bludgeon, while his strong frame\ntrembled with emotion, and large drops rolled down his forehead.\n\nAt this moment the man who had butchered the savage a few minutes before\nadvanced towards the girl with his heavy club.  Jack uttered a yell that\nrang like a death-shriek among the rocks.  With one bound he leaped over\na precipice full fifteen feet high, and, before the savages had recovered\nfrom their surprise, was in the midst of them; while Peterkin and I\ndashed through the bushes towards the prisoners.  With one blow of his\nstaff Jack felled the man with the club, then, turning round with a look\nof fury, he rushed upon the big chief with the yellow hair.  Had the blow\nwhich Jack aimed at his head taken effect, the huge savage would have\nneeded no second stroke; but he was agile as a cat, and avoided it by\nspringing to one side, while, at the same time, he swung his ponderous\nclub at the head of his foe.  It was now Jack's turn to leap aside, and\nwell was it for him that the first outburst of his blind fury was over,\nelse he had become an easy prey to his gigantic antagonist; but Jack was\ncool now.  He darted his blows rapidly and well, and the superiority of\nhis light weapon was strikingly proved in this combat, for while he could\neasily evade the blows of the chief's heavy club, the chief could not so\neasily evade those of his light one.  Nevertheless, so quick was he, and\nso frightfully did he fling about the mighty weapon, that, although Jack\nstruck him almost every blow, the strokes had to be delivered so quickly\nthat they wanted force to be very effectual.\n\nIt was lucky for Jack that the other savages considered the success of\ntheir chief in this encounter to be so certain that they refrained from\ninterfering.  Had they doubted it, they would have probably ended the\nmatter at once by felling him.  But they contented themselves with\nawaiting the issue.\n\nThe force which the chief expended in wielding his club now began to be\napparent.  His movements became slower, his breath hissed through his\nclenched teeth, and the surprised savages drew nearer in order to render\nassistance.  Jack observed this movement.  He felt that his fate was\nsealed, and resolved to cast his life upon the next blow.  The chiefs\nclub was again about to descend on his head.  He might have evaded it\neasily, but instead of doing so, he suddenly shortened his grasp of his\nown club, rushed in under the blow, struck his adversary right between\nthe eyes with all his force and fell to the earth, crushed beneath the\nsenseless body of the chief.  A dozen clubs flew high in air ready to\ndescend on the head of Jack, but they hesitated a moment, for the massive\nbody of the chief completely covered him.  That moment saved his life.\nEre the savages could tear the chief's body away, seven of their number\nfell prostrate beneath the clubs of the prisoners whom Peterkin and I had\nset free, and two others fell under our own hand.  We could never have\naccomplished this had not our enemies been so engrossed with the fight\nbetween Jack and their chief that they had failed to observe us until we\nwere upon them.  They still out-numbered our party by three, but we were\nflushed with victory while they were taken by surprise and dispirited by\nthe fall of their chief.  Moreover, they were awe-struck by the sweeping\nfury of Jack, who seemed to have lost his senses altogether, and had no\nsooner shaken himself free of the chief's body than he rushed into the\nmidst of them, and in three blows equalized our numbers.  Peterkin and I\nflew to the rescue, the savages followed us, and, in less than ten\nminutes, the whole of our opponents were knocked down or made prisoners,\nbound hand and foot, and extended side by side upon the sea shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nIntercourse with the savages--Cannibalism prevented--The slain are buried\nand the survivors depart, leaving us again alone on our Coral Island.\n\nAfter the battle was over, the savages crowded round us and gazed at us\nin surprise, while they continued to pour upon us a flood of questions,\nwhich, being wholly unintelligible, of course we could not answer.\nHowever, by way of putting an end to it, Jack took the chief (who had\nrecovered from the effects of his wound) by the hand and shook it warmly.\nNo sooner did the blacks see that this was meant to express good-will\nthan they shook hands with us all round.  After this ceremony was gone\nthrough Jack went up to the girl, who had never once moved from the rock\nwhere she had been left, but had continued an eager spectator of all that\nhad passed.  He made signs to her to follow him and then, taking the\nchief by the hand, was about to conduct him to the bower when his eye\nfell on the poor infant which had been thrown into the sea and was still\nlying on the shore.  Dropping the chief's hand he hastened towards it,\nand, to his great joy, found it to be still alive.  We also found that\nthe mother was beginning to recover slowly.\n\n\"Here, get out o' the way,\" said Jack, pushing us aside, as we stooped\nover the poor woman and endeavoured to restore her, \"I'll soon bring her\nround.\"  So saying, he placed the infant on her bosom and laid its warm\ncheek on hers.  The effect was wonderful.  The woman opened her eyes,\nfelt the child, looked at it, and with a cry of joy clasped it in her\narms, at the same time endeavouring to rise, for the purpose, apparently,\nof rushing into the woods.\n\n\"There, that's all right,\" said Jack, once more taking the chief by the\nhand.  \"Now Ralph and Peterkin, make the women and these fellows follow\nme to the bower.  Well entertain them as hospitably as we can.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the savages were all seated on the ground in front of\nthe bower making a hearty meal off a cold roast pig, several ducks, and a\nvariety of cold fish, together with an unlimited supply of cocoa-nuts,\nbread-fruits, yams, taro, and plums; with all of which they seemed to be\nquite familiar and perfectly satisfied.\n\nMeanwhile, we three being thoroughly knocked up with our day's work, took\na good draught of cocoa-nut lemonade, and throwing ourselves on our beds\nfell fast asleep.  The savages it seems followed our example, and in half-\nan-hour the whole camp was buried in repose.\n\nHow long we slept I cannot tell, but this I know, that when we lay down\nthe sun was setting and when we awoke it was high in the heavens.  I\nawoke Jack, who started up in surprise, being unable at first to\ncomprehend our situation.  \"Now, then,\" said he, springing up, \"let's see\nafter breakfast.  Hallo!  Peterkin, lazy fellow, how long do you mean to\nlie there?\"\n\nPeterkin yawned heavily.  \"Well!\" said he, opening his eyes and looking\nup after some trouble, \"if it isn't to-morrow morning, and me thinking it\nwas to-day all this time.  Hallo!  Venus, where did you come from? you\nseem tolerably at home, any how.  Bah! might as well speak to the cat as\nto you--better, in fact, for it understands me, and you don't.\"\n\nThis remark was called forth by the sight of one of the elderly females,\nwho had seated herself on the rock in front of the bower, and, having\nplaced her child at her feet, was busily engaged in devouring the remains\nof a roast pig.\n\nBy this time the natives outside were all astir, and breakfast in an\nadvanced state of preparation.  During the course of it we made sundry\nattempts to converse with the natives by signs, but without effect.  At\nlast we hit upon a plan of discovering their names.  Jack pointed to his\nbreast and add \"Jack,\" very distinctly; then he pointed to Peterkin and\nto me, repeating our names at the same time.  Then he pointed to himself\nagain, and said \"Jack,\" and laying his finger on the breast of the chief,\nlooked inquiringly into his face.  The chief instantly understood him and\nsaid \"Tararo,\" twice, distinctly.  Jack repeated it after him, and the\nchief, nodding his head approvingly, said \"Chuck.\"  On hearing which,\nPeterkin exploded with laughter; but Jack turned and with a frown rebuked\nhim, saying, \"I must look even more indignantly at you than I feel,\nPeterkin, you rascal, for these fellows don't like to be laughed at.\"\nThen turning towards the youngest of the women, who was seated at the\ndoor of the bower, he pointed to her; whereupon the chief said, \"Avatea;\"\nand pointing towards the sun, raised his finger slowly towards the\nzenith, where it remained steadily for a minute or two.\n\n\"What can that mean, I wonder,\" said Jack, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"the chief means she is an angel come down to\nstay here for a while.  If so, she's an uncommonly black one!\"\n\nWe did not feel quite satisfied with this explanation, so Jack went up to\nher and said, \"Avatea.\"  The woman smiled sadly, and nodded her head, at\nthe same time pointing to her breast and then to the sun, in the same\nmanner as the chief had done.  We were much puzzled to know what this\ncould signify, but as there was no way of solving our difficulty we were\nobliged to rest content.\n\nJack now made signs to the natives to follow him, and, taking up his axe,\nhe led them to the place where the battle had been fought.  Here we found\nthe prisoners, who had passed the night on the beach having been totally\nforgotten by us, as our minds had been full of our guests, and were\nultimately overcome by sleep.  They did not seem the worse for their\nexposure, however, as we judged by the hearty appetite with which they\ndevoured the breakfast that was soon after given to them.  Jack then\nbegan to dig a hole in the sand, and, after working a few seconds, he\npointed to it and to the dead bodies that lay exposed on the beach.  The\nnatives immediately perceived what he wanted, and, running for their\npaddles, dug a hole in the course of half an hour that was quite large\nenough to contain all the bodies of the slain.  When it was finished they\ntossed their dead enemies into it with so much indifference that we felt\nassured they would not have put themselves to this trouble had we not\nasked them to do so.  The body of the yellow-haired chief was the last\nthrown in.  This wretched man would have recovered from the blow with\nwhich Jack felled him, and, indeed, he did endeavour to rise during the\nmelee that followed his fall, but one of his enemies, happening to notice\nthe action, dealt him a blow with his club that killed him on the spot.\n\nWhile they were about to throw the sand over this chief, one of the\nsavages stooped over him, and with a knife, made apparently of stone, cut\na large slice of flesh from his thigh.  We knew at once that he intended\nto make use of this for food, and could not repress a cry of horror and\ndisgust.\n\n\"Come, come, you blackguard,\" cried Jack, starting up and seizing the man\nby the arm, \"pitch that into the hole.  Do you hear?\"\n\nThe savage of course did not understand the command, but he perfectly\nunderstood the look of disgust with which Jack regarded the flesh, and\nhis fierce gaze as he pointed towards the hole.  Nevertheless he did not\nobey.  Jack instantly turned to Tararo and made signs to him to enforce\nobedience.  The chief seemed to understand the appeal, for he stepped\nforward, raised his club, and was on the point of dashing out the brains\nof his offending subject, when Jack sprang forward and caught his\nuplifted arm.\n\n\"Stop!\" he shouted, \"you blockhead, I don't want you to kill the man.\"  He\nthen pointed again to the flesh and to the hole.  The chief uttered a few\nwords, which had the desired effect; for the man threw the flesh into the\nhole, which was immediately filled up.  This man was of a morose, sulky\ndisposition, and, during all the time he remained on the island, regarded\nus, especially Jack, with a scowling visage.  His name, we found, was\nMahine.\n\nThe next three or four days were spent by the savages in mending their\ncanoe, which had been damaged by the violent shock it had sustained on\nstriking the shore.  This canoe was a very curious structure.  It was\nabout thirty feet long, and had a high towering stern.  The timbers, of\nwhich it was partly composed, were fastened much in the same way as those\nof our little boat were put together; but the part that seemed most\ncurious to us was a sort of out-rigger, or long plank, which was attached\nto the body of the canoe by means of two stout cross beams.  These beams\nkept the plank parallel with the canoe, but not in contact with it, for\nit floated in the water with an open space between; thus forming a sort\nof double canoe.  This we found was intended to prevent the upsetting of\nthe canoe, which was so narrow that it could not have maintained an\nupright position without the out-rigger.  We could not help wondering\nboth at the ingenuity and the clumsiness of this contrivance.\n\nWhen the canoe was ready, we assisted the natives to carry the prisoners\ninto it, and helped them to load it with provisions and fruit.  Peterkin\nalso went to the plum-tree for the purpose of making a special onslaught\nupon the hogs, and killed no less than six of them.  These we baked and\npresented to our friends on the day of their departure.  On that day\nTararo made a great many energetic signs to us, which, after much\nconsideration, we came to understand were proposals that we should go\naway with him to his island; but, having no desire to do so, we shook our\nheads very decidedly.  However, we consoled him by presenting him with\nour rusty axe, which we thought we could spare, having the excellent one\nwhich had been so providentially washed ashore to us the day we were\nwrecked.  We also gave him a piece of wood with our names carved on it,\nand a piece of string to hang it round his neck as an ornament.\n\nIn a few minutes more we were all assembled on the beach.  Being unable\nto speak to the savages, we went through the ceremony of shaking hands,\nand expected they would depart; but, before doing so, Tararo went up to\nJack and rubbed noses with him, after which he did the same with Peterkin\nand me!  Seeing that this was their mode of salutation, we determined to\nconform to their custom, so we rubbed noses heartily with the whole\nparty, women and all!  The only disagreeable part of the process was,\nwhen we came to rub noses with Mahine, and Peterkin afterwards said, that\nwhen he saw his wolfish eyes glaring so close to his face, he felt much\nmore inclined to _bang_ than to _rub_ his nose.  Avatea was the last to\ntake leave of us, and we experienced a feeling of real sorrow when she\napproached to bid us farewell.  Besides her modest air and gentle manners\nshe was the only one of the party who exhibited the smallest sign of\nregret at parting from us.  Going up to Jack, she put out her flat little\nnose to be rubbed, and thereafter paid the same compliment to Peterkin\nand me.\n\nAn hour later the canoe was out of sight, and we, with an indefinable\nfeeling of sadness creeping round our hearts, were seated in silence\nbeneath the shadow of our bower, meditating on the wonderful events of\nthe last few days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nSagacious and moral remarks in regard to life--A sail!--An unexpected\nsalute--The end of the black cat--A terrible dive--An incautious\nproceeding and a frightful catastrophe.\n\nLife is a strange compound.  Peterkin used to say of it, that it beat a\ndruggist's shop all to sticks; for, whereas the first is a compound of\ngood and bad, the other is a horrible compound of all that is utterly\ndetestable.  And indeed the more I consider it the more I am struck with\nthe strange mixture of good and evil that exists not only in the material\nearth but in our own natures.  In our own Coral Island we had experienced\nevery variety of good that a bountiful Creator could heap on us.  Yet on\nthe night of the storm we had seen how almost, in our case,--and\naltogether, no doubt, in the case of others less fortunate--all this good\nmight be swept away for ever.  We had seen the rich fruit-trees waving in\nthe soft air, the tender herbs shooting upwards under the benign\ninfluence of the bright sun; and, the next day, we had seen these good\nand beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane, crushed and\nhurled to the ground in destructive devastation.  We had lived for many\nmonths in a clime for the most part so beautiful, that we had often\nwondered whether Adam and Eve had found Eden more sweet; and we had seen\nthe quiet solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by ferocious\nsavages, and the white sands stained with blood and strewed with lifeless\nforms; yet, among these cannibals, we had seen many symptoms of a kindly\nnature.  I pondered these things much, and, while I considered them,\nthere recurred to my memory those words which I had read in my Bible,--the\nworks of God are wonderful, and his ways past finding out.\n\nAfter these poor savages had left us, we used to hold long and frequent\nconversations about them, and I noticed that Peterkin's manner was now\nmuch altered.  He did not, indeed, jest less heartily than before, but he\ndid so less frequently, and often there was a tone of deep seriousness in\nhis manner, if not in his words, which made him seem to Jack and me as if\nhe had grown two years older within a few days.  But indeed I was not\nsurprised at this, when I reflected on the awful realities which we had\nwitnessed so lately.  We could by no means shake off a tendency to gloom\nfor several weeks afterwards; but, as time wore away, our usual good\nspirits returned somewhat, and we began to think of the visit of the\nsavages with feelings akin to those with which we recall a terrible\ndream.\n\nOne day we were all enjoying ourselves in the Water Garden, preparatory\nto going on a fishing excursion; for Peterkin had kept us in such\nconstant supply of hogs that we had become quite tired of pork, and\ndesired a change.  Peterkin was sunning himself on the ledge of rock,\nwhile we were creeping among the rocks below.  Happening to look up, I\nobserved Peterkin cutting the most extraordinary capers and making\nviolent gesticulations for us to come up; so I gave Jack a push, and rose\nimmediately.\n\n\"A sail! a sail!  Ralph, look!  Jack, away on the horizon there, just\nover the entrance to the lagoon!\" cried Peterkin, as we scrambled up the\nrocks.\n\n\"So it is, and a schooner, too!\" said Jack, as he proceeded hastily to\ndress.\n\nOur hearts were thrown into a terrible flutter by this discovery, for if\nit should touch at our island we had no doubt the captain would be happy\nto give us a passage to some of the civilized islands, where we could\nfind a ship sailing for England, or some other part of Europe.  Home,\nwith all its associations, rushed in upon my heart like a flood, and,\nmuch though I loved the Coral Island and the bower which had now been our\nhome so long, I felt that I could have quitted all at that moment without\na sigh.  With joyful anticipations we hastened to the highest point of\nrock near our dwelling, and awaited the arrival of the vessel, for we now\nperceived that she was making straight for the island, under a steady\nbreeze.\n\nIn less than an hour she was close to the reef, where she rounded to, and\nbacked her topsails in order to survey the coast.  Seeing this, and\nfearing that they might not perceive us, we all three waved pieces of\ncocoa-nut cloth in the air, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing them\nbeginning to lower a boat and bustle about the decks as if they meant to\nland.  Suddenly a flag was run up to the peak, a little cloud of white\nsmoke rose from the schooner's side, and, before we could guess their\nintentions, a cannon-shot came crashing through the bushes, carried away\nseveral cocoa-nut trees in its passage, and burst in atoms against the\ncliff a few yards below the spot on which we stood.\n\nWith feelings of terror we now observed that the flag at the schooner's\npeak was black, with a Death's head and cross bones upon it.  As we gazed\nat each other in blank amazement, the word \"pirate\" escaped our lips\nsimultaneously.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" cried Peterkin, as we observed a boat shoot from\nthe vessel's side, and make for the entrance of the reef.  \"If they take\nus off the island, it will either be to throw us overboard for sport, or\nto make pirates of us.\"\n\nI did not reply, but looked at Jack, as being our only resource in this\nemergency.  He stood with folded arms, and his eyes fixed with a grave,\nanxious expression on the ground.  \"There is but one hope,\" said he,\nturning with a sad expression of countenance to Peterkin; \"perhaps, after\nall, we may not have to resort to it.  If these villains are anxious to\ntake us, they will soon overrun the whole island.  But come, follow me.\"\n\nStopping abruptly in his speech, Jack bounded into the woods, and led us\nby a circuitous route to Spouting Cliff.  Here he halted, and, advancing\ncautiously to the rocks, glanced over their edge.  We were soon by his\nside, and saw the boat, which was crowded with armed men, just touching\nthe shore.  In an instant the crew landed, formed line, and rushed up to\nour bower.\n\nIn a few seconds we saw them hurrying back to the boat, one of them\nswinging the poor cat round his head by the tail.  On reaching the\nwater's edge, he tossed it far into the sea, and joined his companions,\nwho appeared to be holding a hasty council.\n\n\"You see what we may expect,\" said Jack bitterly.  \"The man who will\nwantonly kill a poor brute for sport will think little of murdering a\nfellow-creature.  Now, boys, we have but one chance left,--the Diamond\nCave.\"\n\n\"The Diamond Cave!\" cried Peterkin, \"then my chance is a poor one, for I\ncould not dive into it if all the pirates on the Pacific were at my\nheels.\"\n\n\"Nay, but,\" said I, \"we will take you down, Peterkin, if you will only\ntrust us.\"\n\nAs I spoke, we observed the pirates scatter over the beach, and radiate,\nas if from a centre, towards the woods and along shore.\n\n\"Now, Peterkin,\" said Jack, in a solemn tone, \"you must make up your mind\nto do it, or we must make up our minds to die in your company.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jack, my dear friend,\" cried Peterkin, turning pale, \"leave me; I\ndon't believe they'll think it worth while to kill me.  Go, you and\nRalph, and dive into the cave.\"\n\n\"That will not I,\" answered Jack quietly, while he picked up a stout\ncudgel from the ground.  \"So now, Ralph, we must prepare to meet these\nfellows.  Their motto is, 'No quarter.'  If we can manage to floor those\ncoming in this direction, we may escape into the woods for a while.\"\n\n\"There are five of them,\" said I; \"we have no chance.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" cried Peterkin, starting up, and grasping Jack convulsively\nby the arm, \"let us dive; I will go.\"\n\nThose who are not naturally expert in the water know well the feelings of\nhorror that overwhelm them, when in it, at the bare idea of being held\ndown, even for a few seconds,--that spasmodic, involuntary recoil from\ncompulsory immersion which has no connection whatever with cowardice; and\nthey will understand the amount of resolution that it required in\nPeterkin to allow himself to be dragged down to a depth of ten feet, and\nthen, through a narrow tunnel, into an almost pitch-dark cavern.  But\nthere was no alternative.  The pirates had already caught sight of us,\nand were now within a short distance of the rocks.\n\nJack and I seized Peterkin by the arms.\n\n\"Now, keep quite still, no struggling,\" said Jack, \"or we are lost.\"\n\nPeterkin made no reply, but the stern gravity of his marble features, and\nthe tension of his muscles, satisfied us that he had fully made up his\nmind to go through with it.  Just as the pirates gained the foot of the\nrocks, which hid us for a moment from their view, we bent over the sea,\nand plunged down together head foremost.  Peterkin behaved like a hero.\nHe floated passively between us like a log of wood, and we passed the\ntunnel and rose into the cave in a shorter space of time than I had ever\ndone it before.\n\nPeterkin drew a long, deep breath on reaching the surface; and in a few\nseconds we were all standing on the ledge of rock in safety.  Jack now\nsearched for the tinder and torch, which always lay in the cave.  He soon\nfound them, and, lighting the torch, revealed to Peterkin's wondering\ngaze the marvels of the place.  But we were too wet to waste much time in\nlooking about us.  Our first care was to take off our clothes, and wring\nthem as dry as we could.  This done, we proceeded to examine into the\nstate of our larder, for, as Jack truly remarked, there was no knowing\nhow long the pirates might remain on the island.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"they may take it into their heads to stop here\naltogether, and so we shall be buried alive in this place.\"\n\n\"Don't you think, Peterkin, that it's the nearest thing to being drowned\nalive that you ever felt?\" said Jack with a smile.  \"But I've no fear of\nthat.  These villains never stay long on shore.  The sea is their home,\nso you may depend upon it that they won't stay more than a day or two at\nthe furthest.\"\n\nWe now began to make arrangements for spending the night in the cavern.\nAt various periods Jack and I had conveyed cocoa nuts and other fruits,\nbesides rolls of cocoa-nut cloth, to this submarine cave, partly for\namusement, and partly from a feeling that we might possibly be driven one\nday to take shelter here from the savages.  Little did we imagine that\nthe first savages who would drive us into it would be white savages,\nperhaps our own countrymen.  We found the cocoa-nuts in good condition,\nand the cooked yams, but the bread-fruits were spoiled.  We also found\nthe cloth where we had left it; and, on opening it out, there proved to\nbe sufficient to make a bed; which was important, as the rock was damp.\nHaving collected it all together, we spread out our bed, placed our torch\nin the midst of us, and ate our supper.  It was indeed a strange chamber\nto feast in; and we could not help remarking on the cold, ghastly\nappearance of the walls, and the black water at our side, with the thick\ndarkness beyond, and the sullen sound of the drops that fell at long\nintervals from the roof of the cavern into the still water; and the\nstrong contrast between all this and our bed and supper, which, with our\nfaces, were lit up with the deep red flame of the torch.\n\nWe sat long over our meal, talking together in subdued voices, for we did\nnot like the dismal echoes that rang through the vault above when we\nhappened to raise them.  At last the faint light that came through the\nopening died away, warning us that it was night and time for rest.  We\ntherefore put out our torch and lay down to sleep.\n\nOn awaking, it was some time ere we could collect our faculties so as to\nremember where we were, and we were in much uncertainty as to whether it\nwas early or late.  We saw by the faint light that it was day, but could\nnot guess at the hour; so Jack proposed that he should dive out and\nreconnoitre.\n\n\"No, Jack,\" said I, \"do you rest here.  You've had enough to do during\nthe last few days.  Rest yourself now, and take care of Peterkin, while I\ngo out to see what the pirates are about.  I'll be very careful not to\nexpose myself, and I'll bring you word again in a short time.\"\n\n\"Very well, Ralph,\" answered Jack, \"please yourself, but don't be long;\nand if you'll take my advice you'll go in your clothes, for I would like\nto have some fresh cocoa nuts, and climbing trees without clothes is\nuncomfortable, to say the least of it.\"\n\n\"The pirates will be sure to keep a sharp lookout,\" said Peterkin, \"so,\npray, be careful.\"\n\n\"No fear,\" said I; \"good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" answered my comrades.\n\nAnd while the words were yet sounding in my ears, I plunged into the\nwater, and in a few seconds found myself in the open air.  On rising, I\nwas careful to come up gently and to breathe softly, while I kept close\nin beside the rocks; but, as I observed no one near me, I crept slowly\nout, and ascended the cliff a step at a time, till I obtained a full view\nof the shore.  No pirates were to be seen,--even their boat was gone; but\nas it was possible they might have hidden themselves, I did not venture\ntoo boldly forward.  Then it occurred to me to look out to sea, when, to\nmy surprise, I saw the pirate schooner sailing away almost hull-down on\nthe horizon!  On seeing this I uttered a shout of joy.  Then my first\nimpulse was to dive back to tell my companions the good news; but I\nchecked myself, and ran to the top of the cliff, in order to make sure\nthat the vessel I saw was indeed the pirate schooner.  I looked long and\nanxiously at her, and, giving vent to a deep sigh of relief, said aloud,\n\"Yes, there she goes; the villains have been baulked of their prey this\ntime at least.\"\n\n\"Not so sure of that!\" said a deep voice at my side; while, at the same\nmoment, a heavy hand grasped my shoulder, and held it as if in a vice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nI fall into the hands of pirates--How they treated me, and what I said to\nthem--The result of the whole ending in a melancholy separation and in a\nmost unexpected gift.\n\nMy heart seemed to leap into my throat at the words; and, turning round,\nI beheld a man of immense stature, and fierce aspect regarding me with a\nsmile of contempt.  He was a white man,--that is to say, he was a man of\nEuropean blood, though his face, from long exposure to the weather, was\ndeeply bronzed.  His dress was that of a common seaman, except that he\nhad on a Greek skull-cap, and wore a broad shawl of the richest silk\nround his waist.  In this shawl were placed two pair of pistols and a\nheavy cutlass.  He wore a beard and moustache, which, like the locks on\nhis head, were short, curly, and sprinkled with gray hairs.\n\n\"So, youngster,\" he said, with a Sardonic smile, while I felt his grasp\ntighten on my shoulder, \"the villains have been baulked of their prey,\nhave they?  We shall see, we shall see.  Now, you whelp, look yonder.\"  As\nhe spoke, the pirate uttered a shrill whistle.  In a second or two it was\nanswered, and the pirate-boat rowed round the point at the Water Garden,\nand came rapidly towards us.  \"Now, go, make a fire on that point; and\nhark'ee, youngster, if you try to run away, I'll send a quick and sure\nmessenger after you,\" and he pointed significantly at his pistols.\n\nI obeyed in silence, and as I happened to have the burning-glass in my\npocket, a fire was speedily kindled, and a thick smoke ascended into the\nair.  It had scarcely appeared for two minutes when the boom of a gun\nrolled over the sea, and, looking up, I saw that the schooner was making\nfor the island again.  It now flashed across me that this was a ruse on\nthe part of the pirates, and that they had sent their vessel away,\nknowing that it would lead us to suppose that they had left altogether.\nBut there was no use of regret now.  I was completely in their power, so\nI stood helplessly beside the pirate watching the crew of the boat as\nthey landed on the beach.  For an instant I contemplated rushing over the\ncliff into the sea, but this I saw I could not now accomplish, as some of\nthe men were already between me and the water.\n\nThere was a good deal of jesting at the success of their scheme, as the\ncrew ascended the rocks and addressed the man who had captured me by the\ntitle of captain.  They were a ferocious set of men, with shaggy beards\nand scowling brows.  All of them were armed with cutlasses and pistols,\nand their costumes were, with trifling variations, similar to that of the\ncaptain.  As I looked from one to the other, and observed the low,\nscowling brows, that never unbent, even when the men laughed, and the\nmean, rascally expression that sat on each face, I felt that my life hung\nby a hair.\n\n\"But where are the other cubs?\" cried one of the men, with an oath that\nmade me shudder.  \"I'll swear to it there were three, at least, if not\nmore.\"\n\n\"You hear what he says, whelp; where are the other dogs?\" said the\ncaptain.\n\n\"If you mean my companions,\" said I, in a low voice, \"I won't tell you.\"\n\nA loud laugh burst from the crew at this answer.\n\nThe pirate captain looked at me in surprise.  Then drawing a pistol from\nhis belt, he cocked it and said, \"Now, youngster, listen to me.  I've no\ntime to waste here.  If you don't tell me all you know, I'll blow your\nbrains out!  Where are your comrades?\"\n\nFor an instant I hesitated, not knowing what to do in this extremity.\nSuddenly a thought occurred to me.\n\n\"Villain,\" said I, shaking my clenched fist in his face, \"to blow my\nbrains out would make short work of me, and be soon over.  Death by\ndrowning is as sure, and the agony prolonged, yet, I tell you to your\nface, if you were to toss me over yonder cliff into the sea, I would not\ntell you where my companions are, and I dare you to try me!\"\n\nThe pirate captain grew white with rage as I spoke.  \"Say you so?\" cried\nhe, uttering a fierce oath.  \"Here, lads, take him by the legs and heave\nhim in,--quick!\"\n\nThe men, who were utterly silenced with surprise at my audacity,\nadvanced, and seized me, and, as they carried me towards the cliff, I\ncongratulated myself not a little on the success of my scheme, for I knew\nthat once in the water I should be safe, and could rejoin Jack and\nPeterkin in the cave.  But my hopes were suddenly blasted by the captain\ncrying out, \"Hold on, lads, hold on.  We'll give him a taste of the thumb-\nscrews before throwing him to the sharks.  Away with him into the boat.\nLook alive! the breeze is freshening.\"\n\nThe men instantly raised me shoulder high, and, hurrying down the rocks,\ntossed me into the bottom of the boat, where I lay for some time stunned\nwith the violence of my fall.\n\nOn recovering sufficiently to raise myself on my elbow, I perceived that\nwe were already outside the coral reef, and close alongside the schooner,\nwhich was of small size and clipper built.  I had only time to observe\nthis much, when I received a severe kick on the side from one of the men,\nwho ordered me, in a rough voice, to jump aboard.  Rising hastily I\nclambered up the side.  In a few minutes the boat was hoisted on deck,\nthe vessel's head put close to the wind, and the Coral Island dropped\nslowly astern as we beat up against a head sea.\n\nImmediately after coming aboard, the crew were too busily engaged in\nworking the ship and getting in the boat to attend to me, so I remained\nleaning against the bulwarks close to the gangway, watching their\noperations.  I was surprised to find that there were no guns or\ncarronades of any kind in the vessel, which had more of the appearance of\na fast-sailing trader than a pirate.  But I was struck with the neatness\nof everything.  The brass work of the binnacle and about the tiller, as\nwell as the copper belaying-pins, were as brightly polished as if they\nhad just come from the foundry.  The decks were pure white, and smooth.\nThe masts were clean-scraped and varnished, except at the cross-trees and\ntruck, which were painted black.  The standing and running rigging was in\nthe most perfect order, and the sails white as snow.  In short,\neverything, from the single narrow red stripe on her low black hull to\nthe trucks on her tapering masts, evinced an amount of care and strict\ndiscipline that would have done credit to a ship of the Royal Navy.  There\nwas nothing lumbering or unseemly about the vessel, excepting, perhaps, a\nboat, which lay on the deck with its keel up between the fore and main\nmasts.  It seemed disproportionately large for the schooner; but, when I\nsaw that the crew amounted to between thirty and forty men, I concluded\nthat this boat was held in reserve, in case of any accident compelling\nthe crew to desert the vessel.\n\nAs I have before said, the costumes of the men were similar to that of\nthe captain.  But in head gear they differed not only from him but from\neach other, some wearing the ordinary straw hat of the merchant service,\nwhile others wore cloth caps and red worsted night-caps.  I observed that\nall their arms were sent below; the captain only retaining his cutlass\nand a single pistol in the folds of his shawl.  Although the captain was\nthe tallest and most powerful man in the ship, he did not strikingly\nexcel many of his men in this respect, and the only difference that an\nordinary observer would have noticed was, a certain degree of open\ncandour, straightforward daring, in the bold, ferocious expression of his\nface, which rendered him less repulsive than his low-browed associates,\nbut did not by any means induce the belief that he was a hero.  This look\nwas, however, the indication of that spirit which gave him the\npre-eminence among the crew of desperadoes who called him captain.  He\nwas a lion-like villain; totally devoid of personal fear, and utterly\nreckless of consequences, and, therefore, a terror to his men, who\nindividually hated him, but unitedly felt it to be their advantage to\nhave him at their head.\n\nBut my thoughts soon reverted to the dear companions whom I had left on\nshore, and as I turned towards the Coral Island, which was now far away\nto leeward, I sighed deeply, and the tears rolled slowly down my cheeks\nas I thought that I might never see them more.\n\n\"So you're blubbering, are you, you obstinate whelp?\" said the deep voice\nof the captain, as he came up and gave me a box on the ear that nearly\nfelled me to the deck.  \"I don't allow any such weakness aboard o' this\nship.  So clap a stopper on your eyes or I'll give you something to cry\nfor.\"\n\nI flushed with indignation at this rough and cruel treatment, but felt\nthat giving way to anger would only make matters worse, so I made no\nreply, but took out my handkerchief and dried my eyes.\n\n\"I thought you were made of better stuff,\" continued the captain,\nangrily; \"I'd rather have a mad bull-dog aboard than a water-eyed puppy.\nBut I'll cure you, lad, or introduce you to the sharks before long.  Now\ngo below, and stay there till I call you.\"\n\nAs I walked forward to obey, my eye fell on a small keg standing by the\nside of the main-mast, on which the word _gunpowder_ was written in\npencil.  It immediately flashed across me that, as we were beating up\nagainst the wind, anything floating in the sea would be driven on the\nreef encircling the Coral Island.  I also recollected--for thought is\nmore rapid than the lightning--that my old companions had a pistol.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, therefore, I lifted the keg from the deck\nand tossed it into the sea!  An exclamation of surprise burst from the\ncaptain and some of the men who witnessed this act of mine.\n\nStriding up to me, and uttering fearful imprecations, the captain raised\nhis hand to strike me, while he shouted, \"Boy! whelp! what mean you by\nthat?\"\n\n\"If you lower your hand,\" said I, in a loud voice, while I felt the blood\nrush to my temples, \"I'll tell you.  Until you do so I'm dumb!\"\n\nThe captain stepped back and regarded me with a look of amazement.\n\n\"Now,\" continued I, \"I threw that keg into the sea because the wind and\nwaves will carry it to my friends on the Coral Island, who happen to have\na pistol, but no powder.  I hope that it will reach them soon, and my\nonly regret is that the keg was not a bigger one.  Moreover, pirate, you\nsaid just now that you thought I was made of better stuff!  I don't know\nwhat stuff I am made of,--I never thought much about that subject; but\nI'm quite certain of this, that I am made of such stuff as the like of\nyou shall never tame, though you should do your worst.\"\n\nTo my surprise the captain, instead of flying into a rage, smiled, and,\nthrusting his hand into the voluminous shawl that encircled his waist,\nturned on his heel and walked aft, while I went below.\n\nHere, instead of being rudely handled, as I had expected, the men\nreceived me with a shout of laughter, and one of them, patting me on the\nback, said, \"Well done, lad! you're a brick, and I have no doubt will\nturn out a rare cove.  Bloody Bill, there, was just such a fellow as you\nare, and he's now the biggest cut-throat of us all.\"\n\n\"Take a can of beer, lad,\" cried another, \"and wet your whistle after\nthat speech o' your'n to the captain.  If any one o' us had made it,\nyoungster, he would have had no whistle to wet by this time.\"\n\n\"Stop your clapper, Jack,\" vociferated a third; \"give the boy a junck o'\nmeat.  Don't you see he's a'most goin' to kick the bucket?\"\n\n\"And no wonder,\" said the first speaker, with an oath, \"after the tumble\nyou gave him into the boat.  I guess it would have broke _your_ neck if\nyou had got it.\"\n\nI did indeed feel somewhat faint; which was owing, doubtless, to the\ncombined effects of ill-usage and hunger; for it will be recollected that\nI had dived out of the cave that morning before breakfast, and it was now\nnear mid-day.  I therefore gladly accepted a plate of boiled pork and a\nyam, which were handed to me by one of the men from the locker on which\nsome of the crew were seated eating their dinner.  But I must add that\nthe zest with which I ate my meal was much abated in consequence of the\nfrightful oaths and the terrible language that flowed from the lips of\nthese godless men, even in the midst of their hilarity and good-humour.\nThe man who had been alluded to as Bloody Bill was seated near me, and I\ncould not help wondering at the moody silence he maintained among his\ncomrades.  He did indeed reply to their questions in a careless, off-hand\ntone, but he never volunteered a remark.  The only difference between him\nand the others was his taciturnity and his size, for he was nearly, if\nnot quite, as large a man as the captain.\n\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon I was left to my own reflections,\nwhich were anything but agreeable, for I could not banish from my mind\nthe threat about the thumb-screws, of the nature and use of which I had a\nvague but terrible conception.  I was still meditating on my unhappy fate\nwhen, just after night-fall, one of the watch on deck called down the\nhatchway,--\n\n\"Hallo there! one o' you, tumble up and light the cabin lamp, and send\nthat boy aft to the captain--sharp!\"\n\n\"Now then, do you hear, youngster? the captain wants you.  Look alive,\"\nsaid Bloody Bill, raising his huge frame from the locker on which he had\nbeen asleep for the last two hours.  He sprang up the ladder and I\ninstantly followed him, and, going aft, was shown into the cabin by one\nof the men, who closed the door after me.\n\nA small silver lamp which hung from a beam threw a dim soft light over\nthe cabin, which was a small apartment, and comfortably but plainly\nfinished.  Seated on a camp-stool at the table, and busily engaged in\nexamining a chart of the Pacific, was the captain, who looked up as I\nentered, and, in a quiet voice, bade me be seated, while he threw down\nhis pencil, and, rising from the table, stretched himself on a sofa at\nthe upper end of the cabin.\n\n\"Boy,\" said he, looking me full in the face, \"what is your name?\"\n\n\"Ralph Rover,\" I replied.\n\n\"Where did you come from, and how came you to be on that island?  How\nmany companions had you on it?  Answer me, now, and mind you tell no\nlies.\"\n\n\"I never tell lies,\" said I, firmly.\n\nThe captain received this reply with a cold sarcastic smile, and bade me\nanswer his questions.\n\nI then told him the history of myself and my companions from the time we\nsailed till the day of his visit to the island, taking care, however, to\nmake no mention of the Diamond Cave.  After I had concluded, he was\nsilent for a few minutes; then, looking up, he said--\"Boy, I believe\nyou.\"\n\nI was surprised at this remark, for I could not imagine why he should not\nbelieve me.  However, I made no reply.\n\n\"And what,\" continued the captain, \"makes you think that this schooner is\na pirate?\"\n\n\"The black flag,\" said I, \"showed me what you are; and if any further\nproof were wanting I have had it in the brutal treatment I have received\nat your hands.\"\n\nThe captain frowned as I spoke, but subduing his anger he continued--\"Boy,\nyou are too bold.  I admit that we treated you roughly, but that was\nbecause you made us lose time and gave us a good deal of trouble.  As to\nthe black flag, that is merely a joke that my fellows play off upon\npeople sometimes in order to frighten them.  It is their humour, and does\nno harm.  I am no pirate, boy, but a lawful trader,--a rough one, I grant\nyou, but one can't help that in these seas, where there are so many\npirates on the water and such murderous blackguards on the land.  I carry\non a trade in sandal-wood with the Feejee Islands; and if you choose,\nRalph, to behave yourself and be a good boy, I'll take you along with me\nand give you a good share of the profits.  You see I'm in want of an\nhonest boy like you, to look after the cabin and keep the log, and\nsuperintend the traffic on shore sometimes.  What say you, Ralph, would\nyou like to become a sandal-wood trader?\"\n\nI was much surprised by this explanation, and a good deal relieved to\nfind that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of\nreplying I said, \"If it be as you state, then why did you take me from my\nisland, and why do you not now take me back?\"\n\nThe captain smiled as he replied, \"I took you off in anger, boy, and I'm\nsorry for it.  I would even now take you back, but we are too far away\nfrom it.  See, there it is,\" he added, laying his finger on the chart,\n\"and we are now here,--fifty miles at least.  It would not be fair to my\nmen to put about now, for they have all an interest in the trade.\"\n\nI could make no reply to this; so, after a little more conversation, I\nagreed to become one of the crew, at least until we could reach some\ncivilized island where I might be put ashore.  The captain assented to\nthis proposition, and after thanking him for the promise, I left the\ncabin and went on deck with feelings that ought to have been lighter, but\nwhich were, I could not tell why, marvellously heavy and uncomfortable\nstill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nBloody Bill--Dark surmises--A strange sail, and a strange crew, and a\nstill stranger cargo--New reasons for favouring missionaries--A murderous\nmassacre, and thoughts thereon.\n\nThree weeks after the conversation narrated in the last chapter, I was\nstanding on the quarter-deck of the schooner watching the gambols of a\nshoal of porpoises that swam round us.  It was a dead calm.  One of those\nstill, hot, sweltering days, so common in the Pacific, when Nature seems\nto have gone to sleep, and the only thing in water or in air that proves\nher still alive, is her long, deep breathing, in the swell of the mighty\nsea.  No cloud floated in the deep blue above; no ripple broke the\nreflected blue below.  The sun shone fiercely in the sky, and a ball of\nfire blazed, with almost equal power, from out the bosom of the water.  So\nintensely still was it, and so perfectly transparent was the surface of\nthe deep, that had it not been for the long swell already alluded to, we\nmight have believed the surrounding universe to be a huge blue liquid\nball, and our little ship the one solitary material speck in all\ncreation, floating in the midst of it.\n\nNo sound broke on our ears save the soft puff now and then of a porpoise,\nthe slow creak of the masts, as we swayed gently on the swell, the patter\nof the reef-points, and the occasional flap of the hanging sails.  An\nawning covered the fore and after parts of the schooner, under which the\nmen composing the watch on deck lolled in sleepy indolence, overcome with\nexcessive heat.  Bloody Bill, as the men invariably called him, was\nstanding at the tiller, but his post for the present was a sinecure, and\nhe whiled away the time by alternately gazing in dreamy abstraction at\nthe compass in the binnacle, and by walking to the taffrail in order to\nspit into the sea.  In one of these turns he came near to where I was\nstanding, and, leaning over the side, looked long and earnestly down into\nthe blue wave.\n\nThis man, although he was always taciturn and often surly, was the only\nhuman being on board with whom I had the slightest desire to become\nbetter acquainted.  The other men, seeing that I did not relish their\ncompany, and knowing that I was a protege of the captain, treated me with\ntotal indifference.  Bloody Bill, it is true, did the same; but as this\nwas his conduct towards every one else, it was not peculiar in reference\nto me.  Once or twice I tried to draw him into conversation, but he\nalways turned away after a few cold monosyllables.  As he now leaned over\nthe taffrail close beside me, I said to him,--\n\n\"Bill, why is it that you are so gloomy?  Why do you never speak to any\none?\"\n\nBill smiled slightly as he replied, \"Why, I s'pose it's because I haint\ngot nothin' to say!\"\n\n\"That's strange,\" said I, musingly; \"you look like a man that could\nthink, and such men can usually speak.\"\n\n\"So they can, youngster,\" rejoined Bill, somewhat sternly; \"and I could\nspeak too if I had a mind to, but what's the use o' speakin' here!  The\nmen only open their mouths to curse and swear, an' they seem to find it\nentertaining; but I don't, so I hold my tongue.\"\n\n\"Well, Bill, that's true, and I would rather not hear you speak at all\nthan hear you speak like the other men; but _I_ don't swear, Bill, so you\nmight talk to me sometimes, I think.  Besides, I'm weary of spending day\nafter day in this way, without a single soul to say a pleasant word to.\nI've been used to friendly conversation, Bill, and I really would take it\nkind if you would talk with me a little now and then.\"\n\nBill looked at me in surprise, and I thought I observed a sad expression\npass across his sun-burnt face.\n\n\"An' where have you been used to friendly conversation,\" said Bill,\nlooking down again into the sea; \"not on that Coral Island, I take it?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said I energetically; \"I have spent many of the happiest\nmonths in my life on that Coral Island;\" and without waiting to be\nfurther questioned, I launched out into a glowing account of the happy\nlife that Jack and Peterkin and I had spent together, and related\nminutely every circumstance that befell us while on the island.\n\n\"Boy, boy,\" said Bill, in a voice so deep that it startled me, \"this is\nno place for you.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said I; \"I'm of little use on board, and I don't like my\ncomrades; but I can't help it, and at anyrate I hope to be free again\nsoon.\"\n\n\"Free?\" said Bill, looking at me in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, free,\" returned I; \"the captain said he would put me ashore after\nthis trip was over.\"\n\n\"_This trip_!  Hark'ee, boy,\" said Bill, lowering his voice, \"what said\nthe captain to you the day you came aboard?\"\n\n\"He said that he was a trader in sandal-wood and no pirate, and told me\nthat if I would join him for this trip he would give me a good share of\nthe profits or put me on shore in some civilized island if I chose.\"\n\nBill's brows lowered savagely as he muttered, \"Ay, he said truth when he\ntold you he was a sandal-wood trader, but he lied when--\"\n\n\"Sail ho!\" shouted the look-out at the masthead.\n\n\"Where, away?\" cried Bill, springing to the tiller; while the men,\nstartled by the sudden cry jumped up and gazed round the horizon.\n\n\"On the starboard quarter, hull down, sir,\" answered the look-out.\n\nAt this moment the captain came on deck, and mounting into the rigging,\nsurveyed the sail through the glass.  Then sweeping his eye round the\nhorizon he gazed steadily at a particular point.\n\n\"Take in top-sails,\" shouted the captain, swinging himself down on the\ndeck by the main-back stay.\n\n\"Take in top-sails,\" roared the first mate.\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir-r-r,\" answered the men as they sprang into the rigging and\nwent aloft like cats.\n\nInstantly all was bustle on board the hitherto quiet schooner.  The top-\nsails were taken in and stowed, the men stood by the sheets and halyards,\nand the captain gazed anxiously at the breeze which was now rushing\ntowards us like a sheet of dark blue.  In a few seconds it struck us.  The\nschooner trembled as if in surprise at the sudden onset, while she fell\naway, then bending gracefully to the wind, as though in acknowledgment of\nher subjection, she cut through the waves with her sharp prow like a\ndolphin, while Bill directed her course towards the strange sail.\n\nIn half an hour we neared her sufficiently to make out that she was a\nschooner, and, from the clumsy appearance of her masts and sails we\njudged her to be a trader.  She evidently did not like our appearance,\nfor, the instant the breeze reached her, she crowded all sail and showed\nus her stern.  As the breeze had moderated a little our top-sails were\nagain shaken out, and it soon became evident,--despite the proverb, \"A\nstern chase is a long one,\" that we doubled her speed and would overhaul\nher speedily.  When within a mile we hoisted British colours, but\nreceiving no acknowledgment, the captain ordered a shot to be fired\nacross her bows.  In a moment, to my surprise, a large portion of the\nbottom of the boat amidships was removed, and in the hole thus exposed\nappeared an immense brass gun.  It worked on a swivel and was elevated by\nmeans of machinery.  It was quickly loaded and fired.  The heavy ball\nstruck the water a few yards ahead of the chase, and, ricochetting into\nthe air, plunged into the sea a mile beyond it.\n\nThis produced the desired effect.  The strange vessel backed her\ntop-sails and hove-to, while we ranged up and lay-to, about a hundred\nyards off.\n\n\"Lower the boat,\" cried the captain.\n\nIn a second the boat was lowered and manned by a part of the crew, who\nwere all armed with cutlasses and pistols.  As the captain passed me to\nget into it, he said, \"jump into the stern sheets, Ralph, I may want\nyou.\"  I obeyed, and in ten minutes more we were standing on the\nstranger's deck.  We were all much surprised at the sight that met our\neyes.  Instead of a crew of such sailors as we were accustomed to see,\nthere were only fifteen blacks standing on the quarter-deck and regarding\nus with looks of undisguised alarm.  They were totally unarmed and most\nof them unclothed; one or two, however, wore portions of European attire.\nOne had on a pair of duck trousers which were much too large for him and\nstuck out in a most ungainly manner.  Another wore nothing but the common\nscanty native garment round the loins, and a black beaver hat.  But the\nmost ludicrous personage of all, and one who seemed to be chief, was a\ntall middle-aged man, of a mild, simple expression of countenance, who\nwore a white cotton shirt, a swallow-tailed coat, and a straw hat, while\nhis black brawny legs were totally uncovered below the knees.\n\n\"Where's the commander of this ship?\" inquired our captain, stepping up\nto this individual.\n\n\"I is capin,\" he answered, taking off his straw hat and making a low bow.\n\n\"You!\" said our captain, in surprise.  \"Where do you come from, and where\nare you bound?  What cargo have you aboard?\"\n\n\"We is come,\" answered the man with the swallow-tail, \"from Aitutaki; we\nwas go for Rarotonga.  We is native miss'nary ship; our name is de _Olive\nBranch_; an' our cargo is two tons cocoa-nuts, seventy pigs, twenty cats,\nand de Gosp'l.\"\n\nThis announcement was received by the crew of our vessel with a shout of\nlaughter, which, however, was peremptorily checked by the captain, whose\nexpression instantly changed from one of severity to that of frank\nurbanity as he advanced towards the missionary and shook him warmly by\nthe hand.\n\n\"I am very glad to have fallen in with you,\" said he, \"and I wish you\nmuch success in your missionary labours.  Pray take me to your cabin, as\nI wish to converse with you privately.\"\n\nThe missionary immediately took him by the hand, and as he led him away I\nheard him saying, \"Me most glad to find you trader; we t'ought you be\npirate.  You very like one 'bout the masts.\"\n\nWhat conversation the captain had with this man I never heard, but he\ncame on deck again in a quarter of an hour, and, shaking hands cordially\nwith the missionary, ordered us into our boat and returned to the\nschooner, which was immediately put before the wind.  In a few minutes\nthe _Olive Branch_ was left far behind us.\n\nThat afternoon, as I was down below at dinner, I heard the men talking\nabout this curious ship.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said one, \"why our captain looked so sweet on yon swallow-\ntailed super-cargo o' pigs and Gospels.  If it had been an ordinary\ntrader, now, he would have taken as many o' the pigs as he required and\nsent the ship with all on board to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Why, Dick, you must be new to these seas if you don't know that,\" cried\nanother.  \"The captain cares as much for the gospel as you do (an' that's\nprecious little), but he knows, and everybody knows, that the only place\namong the southern islands where a ship can put in and get what she wants\nin comfort, is where the gospel has been sent to.  There are hundreds o'\nislands, at this blessed moment, where you might as well jump straight\ninto a shark's maw as land without a band o' thirty comrades armed to the\nteeth to back you.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said a man with a deep scar over his right eye, \"Dick's new to the\nwork.  But if the captain takes us for a cargo o' sandal-wood to the\nFeejees he'll get a taste o' these black gentry in their native\ncondition.  For my part I don't know, an' I don't care, what the gospel\ndoes to them; but I know that when any o' the islands chance to get it,\ntrade goes all smooth an' easy; but where they ha'nt got it, Beelzebub\nhimself could hardly desire better company.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to be a good judge,\" cried another, laughing, \"for\nyou've never kept any company but the worst all your life!\"\n\n\"Ralph Rover!\" shouted a voice down the hatchway.  \"Captain wants you,\naft.\"\n\nSpringing up the ladder I hastened to the cabin, pondering as I went the\nstrange testimony borne by these men to the effect of the gospel on\nsavage natures;--testimony which, as it was perfectly disinterested, I\nhad no doubt whatever was strictly true.\n\nOn coming again on deck I found Bloody Bill at the helm, and as we were\nalone together I tried to draw him into conversation.  After repeating to\nhim the conversation in the forecastle about the missionaries, I said,--\n\n\"Tell me, Bill, is this schooner really a trader in sandal-wood?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ralph, she is; but she's just as really a pirate.  The black flag\nyou saw flying at the peak was no deception.\"\n\n\"Then how can you say she's a trader?\" asked I.\n\n\"Why, as to that, she trades when she can't take by force, but she takes\nby force, when she can, in preference.  Ralph,\" he added, lowering his\nvoice, \"if you had seen the bloody deeds that I have witnessed done on\nthese decks you would not need to ask if we were pirates.  But you'll\nfind it out soon enough.  As for the missionaries, the captain favours\nthem because they are useful to him.  The South-Sea islanders are such\nincarnate fiends that they are the better of being tamed, and the\nmissionaries are the only men who can do it.\"\n\nOur track after this lay through several clusters of small islets, among\nwhich we were becalmed more than once.  During this part of our voyage\nthe watch on deck and the look-out at the mast-head were more than\nusually vigilant, as we were not only in danger of being attacked by the\nnatives, who, I learned from the captain's remarks, were a bloody and\ndeceitful tribe at this group, but we were also exposed to much risk from\nthe multitudes of coral reefs that rose up in the channels between the\nislands, some of them just above the surface, others a few feet below it.\nOur precautions against the savages I found were indeed necessary.\n\nOne day we were becalmed among a group of small islands, most of which\nappeared to be uninhabited.  As we were in want of fresh water the\ncaptain sent the boat ashore to bring off a cask or two.  But we were\nmistaken in thinking there were no natives; for scarcely had we drawn\nnear to the shore when a band of naked blacks rushed out of the bush and\nassembled on the beach, brandishing their clubs and spears in a\nthreatening manner.  Our men were well armed, but refrained from showing\nany signs of hostility, and rowed nearer in order to converse with the\nnatives; and I now found that more than one of the crew could imperfectly\nspeak dialects of the language peculiar to the South Sea islanders.  When\nwithin forty yards of the shore, we ceased rowing, and the first mate\nstood up to address the multitude; but, instead of answering us, they\nreplied with a shower of stones, some of which cut the men severely.\nInstantly our muskets were levelled, and a volley was about to be fired,\nwhen the captain hailed us in a loud voice from the schooner, which lay\nnot more than five or six hundred yards off the shore.\n\n\"Don't fire,\" he shouted, angrily.  \"Pull off to the point ahead of you.\"\n\nThe men looked surprised at this order, and uttered deep curses as they\nprepared to obey, for their wrath was roused and they burned for revenge.\nThree or four of them hesitated, and seemed disposed to mutiny.\n\n\"Don't distress yourselves, lads,\" said the mate, while a bitter smile\ncurled his lip.  \"Obey orders.  The captain's not the man to take an\ninsult tamely.  If Long Tom does not speak presently I'll give myself to\nthe sharks.\"\n\nThe men smiled significantly as they pulled from the shore, which was now\ncrowded with a dense mass of savages, amounting, probably, to five or six\nhundred.  We had not rowed off above a couple of hundred yards when a\nloud roar thundered over the sea, and the big brass gun sent a withering\nshower of grape point blank into the midst of the living mass, through\nwhich a wide lane was cut, while a yell, the like of which I could not\nhave imagined, burst from the miserable survivors as they fled to the\nwoods.  Amongst the heaps of dead that lay on the sand, just where they\nhad fallen, I could distinguish mutilated forms writhing in agony, while\never and anon one and another rose convulsively from out the mass,\nendeavoured to stagger towards the wood, and ere they had taken a few\nsteps, fell and wallowed on the bloody sand.  My blood curdled within me\nas I witnessed this frightful and wanton slaughter; but I had little time\nto think, for the captain's deep voice came again over the water towards\nus: \"Pull ashore, lads, and fill your water casks.\"  The men obeyed in\nsilence, and it seemed to me as if even their hard hearts were shocked by\nthe ruthless deed.  On gaining the mouth of the rivulet at which we\nintended to take in water, we found it flowing with blood, for the\ngreater part of those who were slain had been standing on the banks of\nthe stream, a short way above its mouth.  Many of the wretched creatures\nhad fallen into it, and we found one body, which had been carried down,\njammed between two rocks, with the staring eyeballs turned towards us and\nhis black hair waving in the ripples of the blood-red stream.  No one\ndared to oppose our landing now, so we carried our casks to a pool above\nthe murdered group, and having filled them, returned on board.\nFortunately a breeze sprang up soon afterwards and carried us away from\nthe dreadful spot; but it could not waft me away from the memory of what\nI had seen.\n\n\"And this,\" thought I, gazing in horror at the captain, who, with a quiet\nlook of indifference, leaned upon the taffrail smoking a cigar and\ncontemplating the fertile green islets as they passed like a lovely\npicture before our eyes--\"this is the man who favours the missionaries\nbecause they are useful to him and can tame the savages better than any\none else can do it!\"  Then I wondered in my mind whether it were possible\nfor any missionary to tame _him_!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nBloody Bill is communicative and sagacious--Unpleasant\nprospects--Retrospective meditations interrupted by volcanic agency--The\npirates negotiate with a Feejee chief--Various etceteras that are\ncalculated to surprise and horrify.\n\nIt was many days after the events just narrated ere I recovered a little\nof my wonted spirits.  I could not shake off the feeling for a long time\nthat I was in a frightful dream, and the sight of our captain filled me\nwith so much horror that I kept out of his way as much as my duties about\nthe cabin would permit.  Fortunately he took so little notice of me that\nhe did not observe my changed feelings towards him, otherwise it might\nhave been worse for me.\n\nBut I was now resolved that I would run away the very first island we\nshould land at, and commit myself to the hospitality of the natives\nrather than remain an hour longer than I could help in the pirate\nschooner.  I pondered this subject a good deal, and at last made up my\nmind to communicate my intention to Bloody Bill; for, during several\ntalks I had had with him of late, I felt assured that he too would\nwillingly escape if possible.  When I told him of my design he shook his\nhead.  \"No, no, Ralph,\" said he, \"you must not think of running away\nhere.  Among some of the groups of islands you might do so with safety,\nbut if you tried it here you would find that you had jumped out of the\nfryin' pan into the fire.\"\n\n\"How so, Bill?\" said I, \"would the natives not receive me?\"\n\n\"That they would, lad; but they would eat you too.\"\n\n\"Eat me!\" said I in surprise, \"I thought the South Sea islanders never\nate anybody except their enemies.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Bill.  \"I s'pose 'twas yer tender-hearted friends in\nEngland that put that notion into your head.  There's a set o'\nsoft-hearted folk at home that I knows on, who don't like to have their\nfeelin's ruffled, and when you tell them anything they don't like--that\nshocks them, as they call it--no matter how true it be, they stop their\nears and cry out, 'Oh, that is _too_ horrible!  We can't believe that!'\nAn' they say truth.  They can't believe it 'cause they won't believe it.\nNow, I believe there's thousands o' the people in England who are sich\nborn drivellin' _won't-believers_ that they think the black fellows\nhereaway, at the worst, eat an enemy only now an' then, out o' spite;\nwhereas, I know for certain, and many captains of the British and\nAmerican navies know as well as me, that the Feejee islanders eat not\nonly their enemies but one another; and they do it not for spite, but for\npleasure.  It's a _fact_ that they prefer human flesh to any other.  But\nthey don't like white men's flesh so well as black.  They say it makes\nthem sick.\"\n\n\"Why, Bill,\" said I, \"you told me just now that they would eat _me_ if\nthey caught me.\"\n\n\"So I did; and so I think they would.  I've only heard some o' them say\nthey don't like white men _so well_ as black; but if they was hungry they\nwouldn't be particular.  Anyhow, I'm sure they would kill you.  You see,\nRalph, I've been a good while in them parts, and I've visited the\ndifferent groups of islands oftentimes as a trader.  And thorough goin'\nblackguards some o' them traders are.  No better than pirates, I can tell\nyou.  One captain that I sailed with was not a chip better than the one\nwe're with now.  He was tradin' with a friendly chief one day, aboard his\nvessel.  The chief had swam off to us with the things for trade tied a-\ntop of his head, for them chaps are like otters in the water.  Well, the\nchief was hard on the captain, and would not part with some o' his\nthings.  When their bargainin' was over they shook hands, and the chief\njumped over board to swim ashore; but before he got forty yards from the\nship the captain seized a musket and shot him dead.  He then hove up\nanchor and put to sea, and as we sailed along shore, he dropped six black-\nfellows with his rifle, remarkin' that 'that would spoil the trade for\nthe next comers.'  But, as I was sayin', I'm up to the ways o' these\nfellows.  One o' the laws o' the country is, that every shipwrecked\nperson who happens to be cast ashore, be he dead or alive, is doomed to\nbe roasted and eaten.  There was a small tradin' schooner wrecked off one\nof these islands when we were lyin' there in harbour during a storm.  The\ncrew was lost, all but three men, who swam ashore.  The moment they\nlanded they were seized by the natives and carried up into the woods.  We\nknew pretty well what their fate would be, but we could not help them,\nfor our crew was small, and if we had gone ashore they would likely have\nkilled us all.  We never saw the three men again; but we heard frightful\nyelling, and dancing, and merry-making that night; and one of the\nnatives, who came aboard to trade with us next day, told us that the\n_long pigs_, as he called the men, had been roasted and eaten, and their\nbones were to be converted into sail needles.  He also said that white\nmen were bad to eat, and that most o' the people on shore were sick.\"\n\nI was very much shocked and cast down in my mind at this terrible account\nof the natives, and asked Bill what he would advise me to do.  Looking\nround the deck to make sure that we were not overheard, he lowered his\nvoice and said, \"There are two or three ways that we might escape, Ralph,\nbut none o' them's easy.  If the captain would only sail for some o' the\nislands near Tahiti, we might run away there well enough, because the\nnatives are all Christians; an' we find that wherever the savages take up\nwith Christianity they always give over their bloody ways, and are safe\nto be trusted.  I never cared for Christianity myself,\" he continued, in\na soliloquising voice, \"and I don't well know what it means; but a man\nwith half an eye can see what it does for these black critters.  However,\nthe captain always keeps a sharp look out after us when we get to these\nislands, for he half suspects that one or two o' us are tired of his\ncompany.  Then, we might manage to cut the boat adrift some fine night\nwhen it's our watch on deck, and clear off before they discovered that we\nwere gone.  But we would run the risk o' bein' caught by the blacks.  I\nwouldn't like to try that plan.  But you and I will think over it, Ralph,\nand see what's to be done.  In the meantime it's our watch below, so I'll\ngo and turn in.\"\n\nBill then bade me good night, and went below, while a comrade took his\nplace at the helm; but, feeling no desire to enter into conversation with\nhim, I walked aft, and, leaning over the stern, looked down into the\nphosphorescent waves that gargled around the ladder, and streamed out\nlike a flame of blue light in the vessel's wake.  My thoughts were very\nsad, and I could scarce refrain from tears as I contrasted my present\nwretched position with the happy, peaceful time, I had spent on the Coral\nIsland with my dear companions.  As I thought upon Jack and Peterkin\nanxious forebodings crossed my mind, and I pictured to myself the grief\nand dismay with which they would search every nook and corner of the\nisland, in a vain attempt to discover my dead body; for I felt assured\nthat if they did not see any sign of the pirate schooner or boat, when\nthey came out of the cave to look for me, they would never imagine that I\nhad been carried away.  I wondered, too, how Jack would succeed in\ngetting Peterkin out of the cave without my assistance; and I trembled\nwhen I thought that he might lose presence of mind, and begin to kick\nwhen he was in the tunnel!  These thoughts were suddenly interrupted and\nput to flight by a bright red blaze which lighted up the horizon to the\nsouthward, and cut a crimson glow far over the sea.  This appearance was\naccompanied by a low growling sound, as of distant thunder, and, at the\nsame time, the sky above us became black, while a hot stifling wind blew\naround us in fitful gusts.\n\nThe crew assembled hastily on deck, and most of them were under the\nbelief that a frightful hurricane was pending; but the captain coming on\ndeck, soon explained the phenomena.\n\n\"It's only a volcano,\" said he.  \"I knew there was one hereabouts, but\nthought it was extinct.  Up there and furl top-gallant-sails; we'll\nlikely have a breeze, and it's well to be ready.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a shower began to fall, which we quickly observed was not\nrain, but fine ashes.  As we were many miles distant from the volcano,\nthese must have been carried to us from it by the wind.  As the captain\nhad predicted, a stiff breeze soon afterwards sprang up, under the\ninfluence of which we speedily left the volcano far behind us; but during\nthe greater part of the night we could see its lurid glare and hear its\ndistant thunder.  The shower did not cease to fall for several hours, and\nwe must have sailed under it for nearly forty miles, perhaps farther.\nWhen we emerged from the cloud, our decks and every part of the rigging\nwere completely covered with a thick coat of ashes.  I was much\ninterested in this, and recollected that Jack had often spoken of many of\nthe islands of the Pacific as being volcanoes, either active or extinct,\nand had said that the whole region was more or less volcanic, and that\nsome scientific men were of opinion that the islands of the Pacific were\nnothing more or less than the mountain tops of a huge continent which had\nsunk under the influence of volcanic agency.\n\nThree days after passing the volcano, we found ourselves a few miles to\nwindward of an island of considerable size and luxuriant aspect.  It\nconsisted of two mountains, which seemed to be nearly four thousand feet\nhigh.  They were separated from each other by a broad valley, whose thick-\ngrowing trees ascended a considerable distance up the mountain sides; and\nrich level plains, or meadow-land, spread round the base of the\nmountains, except at the point immediately opposite the large valley,\nwhere a river seemed to carry the trees, as it were, along with it down\nto the white sandy shore.  The mountain tops, unlike those of our Coral\nIsland, were sharp, needle-shaped, and bare, while their sides were more\nrugged and grand in outline than anything I had yet seen in those seas.\nBloody Bill was beside me when the island first hove in sight.\n\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, \"I know that island well.  They call it Emo.\"\n\n\"Have you been here before, then?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ay, that I have, often, and so has this schooner.  'Tis a famous island\nfor sandal-wood.  We have taken many cargoes off it already, and have\npaid for them too; for the savages are so numerous that we dared not try\nto take it by force.  But our captain has tried to cheat them so often,\nthat they're beginnin' not to like us overmuch now.  Besides, the men\nbehaved ill the last time we were here; and I wonder the captain is not\nafraid to venture.  But he's afraid o' nothing earthly, I believe.\"\n\nWe soon ran inside the barrier coral-reef, and let go our anchor in six\nfathoms water, just opposite the mouth of a small creek, whose shores\nwere densely covered with mangroves and tall umbrageous trees.  The\nprincipal village of the natives lay about half a mile from this point.\nOrdering the boat out, the captain jumped into it, and ordered me to\nfollow him.  The men, fifteen in number, were well armed; and the mate\nwas directed to have Long Tom ready for emergencies.\n\n\"Give way, lads,\" cried the captain.\n\nThe oars fell into the water at the word, the boat shot from the\nschooner's side, and in a few minutes reached the shore.  Here, contrary\nto our expectation, we were met with the utmost cordiality by Romata, the\nprincipal chief of the island, who conducted us to his house, and gave us\nmats to sit upon.  I observed in passing that the natives, of whom there\nwere two or three thousand, were totally unarmed.\n\nAfter a short preliminary palaver, a feast of baked pigs and various\nroots was spread before us; of which we partook sparingly, and then\nproceeded to business.  The captain stated his object in visiting the\nisland, regretted that there had been a slight misunderstanding during\nthe last visit, and hoped that no ill-will was borne by either party, and\nthat a satisfactory trade would be accomplished.\n\nRomata answered that he had forgotten there had been any differences\nbetween them, protested that he was delighted to see his friends again,\nand assured them they should have every assistance in cutting and\nembarking the wood.  The terms were afterwards agreed on, and we rose to\ndepart.  All this conversation was afterwards explained to me by Bill,\nwho understood the language pretty well.\n\nRomata accompanied us on board, and explained that a great chief from\nanother island was then on a visit to him, and that he was to be\nceremoniously entertained on the following day.  After begging to be\nallowed to introduce him to us, and receiving permission, he sent his\ncanoe ashore to bring him off.  At the same time he gave orders to bring\non board his two favourites, a cock and a paroquet.  While the canoe was\ngone on this errand, I had time to regard the savage chief attentively.\nHe was a man of immense size, with massive but beautifully moulded limbs\nand figure, only parts of which, the broad chest and muscular arms, were\nuncovered; for, although the lower orders generally wore no other\nclothing than a strip of cloth called _maro_ round their loins, the\nchief, on particular occasions, wrapped his person in voluminous folds of\na species of native cloth made from the bark of the Chinese\npaper-mulberry.  Romata wore a magnificent black beard and moustache, and\nhis hair was frizzed out to such an extent that it resembled a large\nturban, in which was stuck a long wooden pin!  I afterwards found that\nthis pin served for scratching the head, for which purpose the fingers\nwere too short without disarranging the hair.  But Romata put himself to\nmuch greater inconvenience on account of his hair, for we found that he\nslept with his head resting on a wooden pillow, in which was cut a hollow\nfor the neck, so that the hair of the sleeper might not be disarranged.\n\nIn ten minutes the canoe returned, bringing the other chief, who\ncertainly presented a most extraordinary appearance, having painted one\nhalf of his face red and the other half yellow, besides ornamenting it\nwith various designs in black!  Otherwise he was much the same in\nappearance as Romata, though not so powerfully built.  As this chief had\nnever seen a ship before, except, perchance, some of the petty traders\nthat at long intervals visit these remote islands, he was much taken up\nwith the neatness and beauty of all the fittings of the schooner.  He was\nparticularly struck with a musket which was shown to him, and asked where\nthe white men got hatchets hard enough to cut the tree of which the\nbarrel was made!  While he was thus engaged, his brother chief stood\naloof, talking with the captain, and fondling a superb cock and a little\nblue-headed paroquet, the favourites of which I have before spoken.  I\nobserved that all the other natives walked in a crouching posture while\nin the presence of Romata.  Before our guests left us, the captain\nordered the brass gun to be uncovered and fired for their gratification;\nand I have every reason to believe he did so for the purpose of showing\nour superior power, in case the natives should harbour any evil designs\nagainst us.  Romata had never seen this gun before, as it had not been\nuncovered on previous visits, and the astonishment with which he viewed\nit was very amusing.  Being desirous of knowing its power, he begged that\nthe captain would fire it.  So a shot was put into it.  The chiefs were\nthen directed to look at a rock about two miles out at sea, and the gun\nwas fired.  In a second the top of the rock was seen to burst asunder,\nand to fall in fragments into the sea.\n\nRomata was so delighted with the success of this shot, that he pointed to\na man who was walking on the shore, and begged the captain to fire at\nhim, evidently supposing that his permission was quite sufficient to\njustify the captain in such an act.  He was therefore surprised, and not\na little annoyed, when the captain refused to fire at the native, and\nordered the gun to be housed.\n\nOf all the things, however, that afforded matter of amusement to these\nsavages, that which pleased Romata's visitor most was the ship's pump.  He\nnever tired of examining it, and pumping up the water.  Indeed, so much\nwas he taken up with this pump, that he could not be prevailed on to\nreturn on shore, but sent a canoe to fetch his favourite stool, on which\nhe seated himself, and spent the remainder of the day in pumping the\nbilge-water out of the ship!\n\nNext day the crew went ashore to cut sandal-wood, while the captain, with\none or two men, remained on board, in order to be ready, if need be, with\nthe brass gun, which was unhoused and conspicuously elevated, with its\ncapacious muzzle directed point blank at the chief's house.  The men were\nfully armed as usual; and the captain ordered me to go with them, to\nassist in the work.  I was much pleased with this order, for it freed me\nfrom the captain's company, which I could not now endure, and it gave me\nan opportunity of seeing the natives.\n\nAs we wound along in single file through the rich fragrant groves of\nbanana, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and other trees, I observed that there\nwere many of the plum and banian trees, with which I had become familiar\non the Coral Island.  I noticed also large quantities of taro-roots,\nyams, and sweet potatoes, growing in enclosures.  On turning into an open\nglade of the woods, we came abruptly upon a cluster of native houses.\nThey were built chiefly of bamboos, and were thatched with the large\nthick leaves of the pandanus; but many of them had little more than a\nsloping roof and three sides with an open front, being the most simple\nshelter from the weather that could well be imagined.  Within these, and\naround them, were groups of natives--men, women, and children--who all\nstood up to gaze at us as we marched along, followed by the party of men\nwhom the chief had sent to escort us.  About half a mile inland we\narrived at the spot where the sandal-wood grew, and, while the men set to\nwork, I clambered up an adjoining hill to observe the country.\n\nAbout mid-day, the chief arrived with several followers, one of whom\ncarried a baked pig on a wooden platter, with yams and potatoes on\nseveral plantain leaves, which he presented to the men, who sat down\nunder the shade of a tree to dine.  The chief sat down to dine also; but,\nto my surprise, instead of feeding himself, one of his wives performed\nthat office for him!  I was seated beside Bill, and asked him the reason\nof this.\n\n\"It is beneath his dignity, I believe, to feed himself,\" answered Bill;\n\"but I daresay he's not particular, except on great occasions.  They've a\nstrange custom among them, Ralph, which is called _tabu_, and they carry\nit to great lengths.  If a man chooses a particular tree for his god, the\nfruit o' that tree is tabued to him; and if he eats it, he is sure to be\nkilled by his people, and eaten, of course, for killing means eating\nhereaway.  Then, you see that great mop o' hair on the chief's head?\nWell, he has a lot o' barbers to keep it in order; and it's a law that\nwhoever touches the head of a living chief or the body of a dead one, his\nhands are tabued; so, in that way, the barbers' hands are always tabued,\nand they daren't use them for their lives, but have to be fed like big\nbabies, as they are, sure enough!\"\n\n\"That's odd, Bill.  But look there,\" said I, pointing to a man whose skin\nwas of a much lighter colour than the generality of the natives.  \"I've\nseen a few of these light-skinned fellows among the Fejeeans.  They seem\nto me to be of quite a different race.\"\n\n\"So they are,\" answered Bill.  \"These fellows come from the Tongan\nIslands, which lie a long way to the eastward.  They come here to build\ntheir big war-canoes; and as these take two, and sometimes four years, to\nbuild, there's always some o' the brown-skins among the black sarpents o'\nthese islands.\"\n\n\"By the way, Bill,\" said I, \"your mentioning serpents, reminds me that I\nhave not seen a reptile of any kind since I came to this part of the\nworld.\"\n\n\"No more there are any,\" said Bill, \"if ye except the niggers themselves,\nthere's none on the islands, but a lizard or two and some sich harmless\nthings.  But I never seed any myself.  If there's none on the land,\nhowever, there's more than enough in the water, and that minds me of a\nwonderful brute they have here.  But, come, I'll show it to you.\"  So\nsaying, Bill arose, and, leaving the men still busy with the baked pig,\nled me into the forest.  After proceeding a short distance we came upon a\nsmall pond of stagnant water.  A native lad had followed us, to whom we\ncalled and beckoned him to come to us.  On Bill saying a few words to\nhim, which I did not understand, the boy advanced to the edge of the\npond, and gave a low peculiar whistle.  Immediately the water became\nagitated and an enormous eel thrust its head above the surface and\nallowed the youth to touch it.  It was about twelve feet long, and as\nthick round the body as a man's thigh.\n\n\"There,\" said Bill, his lip curling with contempt, \"what do you think of\nthat for a god, Ralph?  This is one o' their gods, and it has been fed\nwith dozens o' livin' babies already.  How many more it'll get afore it\ndies is hard to say.\"\n\n\"Babies?\" said I, with an incredulous look\n\n\"Ay, babies,\" returned Bill.  \"Your soft-hearted folk at home would say,\n'Oh, horrible! impossible!' to that, and then go away as comfortable and\nunconcerned as if their sayin' 'horrible! impossible!' had made it a lie.\nBut I tell you, Ralph, it's a _fact_.  I've seed it with my own eyes the\nlast time I was here, an' mayhap if you stop a while at this accursed\nplace, and keep a sharp look out, you'll see it too.  They don't feed it\nregularly with livin' babies, but they give it one now and then as a\ntreat.  Bah! you brute!' cried Bill, in disgust, giving the reptile a\nkick on the snout with his heavy boot, that sent it sweltering back in\nagony into its loathsome pool.  I thought it lucky for Bill, indeed for\nall of us, that the native youth's back happened to be turned at the\ntime, for I am certain that if the poor savages had come to know that we\nhad so rudely handled their god, we should have had to fight our way back\nto the ship.  As we retraced our steps I questioned my companion further\non this subject.\n\n\"How comes it, Bill, that the mothers allow such a dreadful thing to be\ndone?\"\n\n\"Allow it? the mothers _do_ it!  It seems to me that there's nothing too\nfiendish or diabolical for these people to do.  Why, in some of the\nislands they have an institution called the _Areoi_, and the persons\nconnected with that body are ready for any wickedness that mortal man can\ndevise.  In fact they stick at nothing; and one o' their customs is to\nmurder their infants the moment they are born.  The mothers agree to it,\nand the fathers do it.  And the mildest ways they have of murdering them\nis by sticking them through the body with sharp splinters of bamboo,\nstrangling them with their thumbs, or burying them alive and stamping\nthem to death while under the sod.\"\n\nI felt sick at heart while my companion recited these horrors.\n\n\"But it's a curious fact,\" he continued, after a pause, during which we\nwalked in silence towards the spot where we had left our comrades,--\"it's\na curious fact, that wherever the missionaries get a footin' all these\nthings come to an end at once, an' the savages take to doin' each other\ngood, and singin' psalms, just like Methodists.\"\n\n\"God bless the missionaries!\" said I, while a feeling of enthusiasm\nfilled my heart, so that I could speak with difficulty.  \"God bless and\nprosper the missionaries till they get a footing in every island of the\nsea!\"\n\n\"I would say Amen to that prayer, Ralph, if I could,\" said Bill, in a\ndeep, sad voice; \"but it would be a mere mockery for a man to ask a\nblessing for others who dare not ask one for himself.  But, Ralph,\" he\ncontinued, \"I've not told you half o' the abominations I have seen durin'\nmy life in these seas.  If we pull long together, lad, I'll tell you\nmore; and if times have not changed very much since I was here last, it's\nlike that you'll have a chance o' seeing a little for yourself before\nlong.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nThe Sandal-wood party--Native children's games, somewhat\nsurprising--Desperate amusements suddenly and fatally brought to a\nclose--An old friend recognised--News--Romata's mad conduct.\n\nNext day the wood-cutting party went ashore again, and I accompanied them\nas before.  During the dinner hour I wandered into the woods alone, being\ndisinclined for food that day.  I had not rambled far when I found myself\nunexpectedly on the sea-shore, having crossed a narrow neck of land which\nseparated the native village from a large bay.  Here I found a party of\nthe islanders busy with one of their war-canoes, which was almost ready\nfor launching.  I stood for a long time watching this party with great\ninterest, and observed that they fastened the timbers and planks to each\nother very much in the same way in which I had seen Jack fasten those of\nour little boat.  But what surprised me most was its immense length,\nwhich I measured very carefully, and found to be a hundred feet long; and\nit was so capacious that it could have held three hundred men.  It had\nthe unwieldy out-rigger and enormously high stern-posts which I had\nremarked on the canoe that came to us while I was on the Coral Island.\nObserving some boys playing at games a short way along the beach, I\nresolved to go and watch them; but as I turned from the natives who were\nengaged so busily and cheerfully at their work, I little thought of the\nterrible event that hung on the completion of that war-canoe.\n\nAdvancing towards the children, who were so numerous that I began to\nthink this must be the general play-ground of the village, I sat down on\na grassy bank under the shade of a plantain-tree, to watch them.  And a\nhappier or more noisy crew I have never seen.  There were at least two\nhundred of them, both boys and girls, all of whom were clad in no other\ngarments than their own glossy little black skins, except the maro, or\nstrip of cloth round the loins of the boys, and a very short petticoat or\nkilt on the girls.  They did not all play at the same game, but amused\nthemselves in different groups.\n\nOne band was busily engaged in a game exactly similar to our blind-man's-\nbuff.  Another set were walking on stilts, which raised the children\nthree feet from the ground.  They were very expert at this amusement and\nseldom tumbled.  In another place I observed a group of girls standing\ntogether, and apparently enjoying themselves very much; so I went up to\nsee what they were doing, and found that they were opening their eye-lids\nwith their fingers till their eyes appeared of an enormous size, and then\nthrusting pieces of straw between the upper and lower lids, across the\neye-ball, to keep them in that position!  This seemed to me, I must\nconfess, a very foolish as well as dangerous amusement.  Nevertheless the\nchildren seemed to be greatly delighted with the hideous faces they made.\nI pondered this subject a good deal, and thought that if little children\nknew how silly they seem to grown-up people when they make faces, they\nwould not be so fond of doing it.  In another place were a number of boys\nengaged in flying kites, and I could not help wondering that some of the\ngames of those little savages should be so like to our own, although they\nhad never seen us at play.  But the kites were different from ours in\nmany respects, being of every variety of shape.  They were made of very\nthin cloth, and the boys raised them to a wonderful height in the air by\nmeans of twine made from the cocoa-nut husk.  Other games there were,\nsome of which showed the natural depravity of the hearts of these poor\nsavages, and made me wish fervently that missionaries might be sent out\nto them.  But the amusement which the greatest number of the children of\nboth sexes seemed to take chief delight in, was swimming and diving in\nthe sea; and the expertness which they exhibited was truly amazing.  They\nseemed to have two principal games in the water, one of which was to dive\noff a sort of stage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea,\nand chase each other in the water.  Some of them went down to an\nextraordinary depth; others skimmed along the surface, or rolled over and\nover like porpoises, or diving under each other, came up unexpectedly and\npulled each other down by a leg or an arm.  They never seemed to tire of\nthis sport, and, from the great heat of the water in the South Seas, they\ncould remain in it nearly all day without feeling chilled.  Many of these\nchildren were almost infants, scarce able to walk; yet they staggered\ndown the beach, flung their round fat little black bodies fearlessly into\ndeep water, and struck out to sea with as much confidence as ducklings.\n\nThe other game to which I have referred was swimming in the surf.  But as\nthis is an amusement in which all engage, from children of ten to gray-\nheaded men of sixty, and as I had an opportunity of witnessing it in\nperfection the day following, I shall describe it more minutely.\n\nI suppose it was in honour of their guest that this grand swimming-match\nwas got up, for Romata came and told the captain that they were going to\nengage in it, and begged him to \"come and see.\"\n\n\"What sort of amusement is this surf swimming?\" I inquired of Bill, as we\nwalked together to a part of the shore on which several thousands of the\nnatives were assembled.\n\n\"It's a very favourite lark with these 'xtr'or'nary critters,\" replied\nBill, giving a turn to the quid of tobacco that invariably bulged out his\nleft cheek.  \"Ye see, Ralph, them fellows take to the water as soon\na'most as they can walk, an' long before they can do that anything\nrespectably, so that they are as much at home in the sea as on the land.\nWell, ye see, I 'spose they found swimmin' for miles out to sea, and\ndivin' fathoms deep, wasn't exciting enough, so they invented this game\no' the surf.  Each man and boy, as you see, has got a short board or\nplank, with which he swims out for a mile or more to sea, and then,\ngettin' on the top o' yon thundering breaker, they come to shore on the\ntop of it, yellin' and screechin' like fiends.  It's a marvel to me that\nthey're not dashed to shivers on the coral reef, for sure an' sartin am I\nthat if any o' us tried it, we wouldn't be worth the fluke of a broken\nanchor after the wave fell.  But there they go!\"\n\nAs he spoke, several hundreds of the natives, amongst whom we were now\nstanding, uttered a loud yell, rushed down the beach, plunged into the\nsurf, and were carried off by the seething foam of the retreating wave.\n\nAt the point where we stood, the encircling coral reef joined the shore,\nso that the magnificent breakers, which a recent stiff breeze had\nrendered larger than usual, fell in thunder at the feet of the multitudes\nwho lined the beach.  For some time the swimmers continued to strike out\nto sea, breasting over the swell like hundreds of black seals.  Then they\nall turned, and, watching an approaching billow, mounted its white crest,\nand, each laying his breast on the short flat board, came rolling towards\nthe shore, careering on the summit of the mighty wave, while they and the\nonlookers shouted and yelled with excitement.  Just as the monster wave\ncurled in solemn majesty to fling its bulky length upon the beach, most\nof the swimmers slid back into the trough behind; others, slipping off\ntheir boards, seized them in their hands, and, plunging through the\nwatery waste, swam out to repeat the amusement; but a few, who seemed to\nme the most reckless, continued their career until they were launched\nupon the beach, and enveloped in the churning foam and spray.  One of\nthese last came in on the crest of the wave most manfully, and landed\nwith a violent bound almost on the spot where Bill and I stood.  I saw by\nhis peculiar head-dress that he was the chief whom the tribe entertained\nas their guest.  The sea-water had removed nearly all the paint with\nwhich his face had been covered; and, as he rose panting to his feet, I\nrecognised, to my surprise, the features of Tararo, my old friend of the\nCoral Island!\n\nTararo at the same moment recognised me, and, advancing quickly, took me\nround the neck and rubbed noses; which had the effect of transferring a\ngood deal of the moist paint from his nose to mine.  Then, recollecting\nthat this was not the white man's mode of salutation, he grasped me by\nthe hand and shook it violently.\n\n\"Hallo, Ralph!\" cried Bill, in surprise, \"that chap seems to have taken a\nsudden fancy to you, or he must be an old acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Right, Bill,\" I replied, \"he is indeed an old acquaintance;\" and I\nexplained in a few words that he was the chief whose party Jack and\nPeterkin and I had helped to save.\n\nTararo having thrown away his surf-board, entered into an animated\nconversation with Bill, pointing frequently during the course of it to\nme; whereby I concluded he must be telling him about the memorable\nbattle, and the part we had taken in it.  When he paused, I begged of\nBill to ask him about the woman Avatea, for I had some hope that she\nmight have come with Tararo on this visit.  \"And ask him,\" said I, \"who\nshe is, for I am persuaded she is of a different race from the\nFeejeeans.\"  On the mention of her name the chief frowned darkly, and\nseemed to speak with much anger.\n\n\"You're right, Ralph,\" said Bill, when the chief had ceased to talk;\n\"she's not a Feejee girl, but a Samoan.  How she ever came to this place\nthe chief does not very clearly explain, but he says she was taken in\nwar, and that he got her three years ago, an' kept her as his daughter\never since.  Lucky for her, poor girl, else she'd have been roasted and\neaten like the rest.\"\n\n\"But why does Tararo frown and look so angry?\" said I.\n\n\"Because the girl's somewhat obstinate, like most o' the sex, an' won't\nmarry the man he wants her to.  It seems that a chief of some other\nisland came on a visit to Tararo and took a fancy to her, but she\nwouldn't have him on no account, bein' already in love, and engaged to a\nyoung chief whom Tararo hates, and she kicked up a desperate shindy; so,\nas he was going on a war expedition in his canoe, he left her to think\nabout it, sayin' he'd be back in six months or so, when he hoped she\nwouldn't be so obstropolous.  This happened just a week ago; an' Tararo\nsays that if she's not ready to go, when the chief returns, as his bride,\nshe'll be sent to him as a _long pig_.\"\n\n\"As a long pig!\" I exclaimed in surprise; \"why what does he mean by\nthat?\"\n\n\"He means somethin' very unpleasant,\" answered Bill with a frown.  \"You\nsee these blackguards eat men an' women just as readily as they eat pigs;\nand, as baked pigs and baked men are very like each other in appearance,\nthey call men _long_ pigs.  If Avatea goes to this fellow as a long pig,\nit's all up with her, poor thing.\"\n\n\"Is she on the island now?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"No, she's at Tararo's island.\"\n\n\"And where does it lie?\"\n\n\"About fifty or sixty miles to the south'ard o' this,\" returned Bill;\n\"but I--\"\n\nAt this moment we were startled by the cry of \"Mao! mao!--a shark! a\nshark!\" which was immediately followed by a shriek that rang clear and\nfearfully loud above the tumult of cries that arose from the savages in\nthe water and on the land.  We turned hastily towards the direction\nwhence the cry came, and had just time to observe the glaring eye-balls\nof one of the swimmers as he tossed his arms in the air.  Next instant he\nwas pulled under the waves.  A canoe was instantly launched, and the hand\nof the drowning man was caught, but only half of his body was dragged\nfrom the maw of the monster, which followed the canoe until the water\nbecame so shallow that it could scarcely swim.  The crest of the next\nbillow was tinged with red as it rolled towards the shore.\n\nIn most countries of the world this would have made a deep impression on\nthe spectators, but the only effect it had upon these islanders was to\nmake them hurry with all speed out of the sea, lest a similar fate should\nbefall some of the others; but, so utterly reckless were they of human\nlife, that it did not for a moment suspend the progress of their\namusements.  It is true the surf-swimming ended for that time somewhat\nabruptly, but they immediately proceeded with other games.  Bill told me\nthat sharks do not often attack the surf-swimmers, being frightened away\nby the immense numbers of men and boys in the water, and by the shouting\nand splashing that they make.  \"But,\" said he, \"such a thing as you have\nseen just now don't frighten them much.  They'll be at it again to-morrow\nor next day, just as if there wasn't a single shark between Feejee and\nNova Zembla.\"\n\nAfter this the natives had a series of wrestling and boxing matches; and\nbeing men of immense size and muscle, they did a good deal of injury to\neach other, especially in boxing, in which not only the lower orders, but\nseveral of the chiefs and priests engaged.  Each bout was very quickly\nterminated, for they did not pretend to a scientific knowledge of the\nart, and wasted no time in sparring, but hit straight out at each other's\nheads, and their blows were delivered with great force.  Frequently one\nof the combatants was knocked down with a single blow; and one gigantic\nfellow hit his adversary so severely that he drove the skin entirely off\nhis forehead.  This feat was hailed with immense applause by the\nspectators.\n\nDuring these exhibitions, which were very painful to me, though I confess\nI could not refrain from beholding them, I was struck with the beauty of\nmany of the figures and designs that were tattooed on the persons of the\nchiefs and principal men.  One figure, that seemed to me very elegant,\nwas that of a palm-tree tattooed on the back of a man's leg, the roots\nrising, as it were, from under his heel, the stem ascending the tendon of\nthe ankle, and the graceful head branching out upon the calf.  I\nafterwards learned that this process of tattooing is very painful, and\ntakes long to do, commencing at the age of ten, and being continued at\nintervals up to the age of thirty.  It is done by means of an instrument\nmade of bone, with a number of sharp teeth with which the skin is\npunctured.  Into these punctures a preparation made from the kernel of\nthe candle-nut, mixed with cocoa-nut oil, is rubbed, and the mark thus\nmade is indelible.  The operation is performed by a class of men whose\nprofession it is, and they tattoo as much at a time, as the person on\nwhom they are operating can bear; which is not much, the pain and\ninflammation caused by tattooing being very great, sometimes causing\ndeath.  Some of the chiefs were tattooed with an ornamental stripe down\nthe legs, which gave them the appearance of being clad in tights.  Others\nhad marks round the ankles and insteps, which looked like tight-fitting\nand elegant boots.  Their faces were also tattooed, and their breasts\nwere very profusely marked with every imaginable species of\ndevice,--muskets, dogs, birds, pigs, clubs, and canoes, intermingled with\nlozenges, squares, circles, and other arbitrary figures.\n\nThe women were not tattooed so much as the men, having only a few marks\non their feet and arms.  But I must say, however objectionable this\nstrange practice may be, it nevertheless had this good effect, that it\ntook away very much from their appearance of nakedness.\n\nNext day, while we were returning from the woods to our schooner, we\nobserved Romata rushing about in the neighbourhood of his house,\napparently mad with passion.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bill to me, \"there he's at his old tricks again.  That's his\nway when he gets drink.  The natives make a sort of drink o' their own,\nand it makes him bad enough; but when he gets brandy he's like a wild\ntiger.  The captain, I suppose, has given him a bottle, as usual, to keep\nhim in good humour.  After drinkin' he usually goes to sleep, and the\npeople know it well and keep out of his way, for fear they should waken\nhim.  Even the babies are taken out of ear-shot; for, when he's waked up,\nhe rushes out just as you see him now, and spears or clubs the first\nperson he meets.\"\n\nIt seemed at the present time, however, that no deadly weapon had been in\nhis way, for the infuriated chief was raging about without one.  Suddenly\nhe caught sight of an unfortunate man who was trying to conceal himself\nbehind a tree.  Rushing towards him, Romata struck him a terrible blow on\nthe head, which knocked out the poor man's eye and also dislocated the\nchief's finger.  The wretched creature offered no resistance; he did not\neven attempt to parry the blow.  Indeed, from what Bill said, I found\nthat he might consider himself lucky in having escaped with his life,\nwhich would certainly have been forfeited had the chief been possessed of\na club at the time.\n\n\"Have these wretched creatures no law among themselves,\" said I, \"which\ncan restrain such wickedness?\"\n\n\"None,\" replied Bill.  \"The chief's word is law.  He might kill and eat a\ndozen of his own subjects any day for nothing more than his own pleasure,\nand nobody would take the least notice of it.\"\n\nThis ferocious deed took place within sight of our party as we wended our\nway to the beach, but I could not observe any other expression on the\nfaces of the men than that of total indifference or contempt.  It seemed\nto me a very awful thing that it should be possible for men to come to\nsuch hardness of heart and callousness to the sight of bloodshed and\nviolence; but, indeed, I began to find that such constant exposure to\nscenes of blood was having a slight effect upon myself, and I shuddered\nwhen I came to think that I, too, was becoming callous.\n\nI thought upon this subject much that night while I walked up and down\nthe deck during my hours of watch; and I came to the conclusion that if\nI, who hated, abhorred, and detested such bloody deeds as I had witnessed\nwithin the last few weeks, could so soon come to be less sensitive about\nthem, how little wonder that these poor ignorant savages, who were born\nand bred in familiarity therewith, should think nothing of them at all,\nand should hold human life in so very slight esteem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\nMischief brewing--My blood is made to run cold--Evil consultations and\nwicked resolves--Bloody Bill attempts to do good and fails--The\nattack--Wholesale murder--The flight--The escape.\n\nNext morning I awoke with a feverish brow and a feeling of deep\ndepression at my heart; and the more I thought on my unhappy fate, the\nmore wretched and miserable did I feel.\n\nI was surrounded on all sides by human beings of the most dreadful\ncharacter, to whom the shedding of blood was mere pastime.  On shore were\nthe natives, whose practices were so horrible that I could not think of\nthem without shuddering.  On board were none but pirates of the blackest\ndye, who, although not cannibals, were foul murderers, and more\nblameworthy even than the savages, inasmuch as they knew better.  Even\nBill, with whom I had, under the strange circumstances of my lot, formed\na kind of intimacy, was so fierce in his nature as to have acquired the\ntitle of \"Bloody\" from his vile companions.  I felt very much cast down\nthe more I considered the subject and the impossibility of delivery, as\nit seemed to me, at least for a long time to come.  At last, in my\nfeeling of utter helplessness, I prayed fervently to the Almighty that he\nwould deliver me out of my miserable condition; and when I had done so I\nfelt some degree of comfort.\n\nWhen the captain came on deck, before the hour at which the men usually\nstarted for the woods, I begged of him to permit me to remain aboard that\nday, as I did not feel well; but he looked at me angrily, and ordered me,\nin a surly tone, to get ready to go on shore as usual.  The fact was that\nthe captain had been out of humour for some time past.  Romata and he had\nhad some differences, and high words had passed between them, during\nwhich the chief had threatened to send a fleet of his war-canoes, with a\nthousand men, to break up and burn the schooner; whereupon the captain\nsmiled sarcastically, and going up to the chief gazed sternly in his\nface, while he said, \"I have only to raise my little finger just now, and\nmy big gun will blow your whole village to atoms in five minutes!\"\nAlthough the chief was a bold man, he quailed before the pirate's glance\nand threat, and made no reply; but a bad feeling had been raised and old\nsores had been opened.\n\nI had, therefore, to go with the wood-cutters that day.  Before starting,\nhowever, the captain called me into the cabin, and said,--\n\n\"Here, Ralph, I've got a mission for you, lad.  That blackguard Romata is\nin the dumps, and nothing will mollify him but a gift; so do you go up to\nhis house and give him these whales' teeth, with my compliments.  Take\nwith you one of the men who can speak the language.\"\n\nI looked at the gift in some surprise, for it consisted of six white\nwhales' teeth, and two of the same dyed bright red, which seemed to me\nvery paltry things.  However, I did not dare to hesitate or ask any\nquestions; so, gathering them up, I left the cabin and was soon on my way\nto the chief's house, accompanied by Bill.  On expressing my surprise at\nthe gift, he said,--\n\n\"They're paltry enough to you or me, Ralph, but they're considered of\ngreat value by them chaps.  They're a sort o' cash among them.  The red\nones are the most prized, one of them bein' equal to twenty o' the white\nones.  I suppose the only reason for their bein' valuable is that there\nain't many of them, and they're hard to be got.\"\n\nOn arriving at the house we found Romata sitting on a mat, in the midst\nof a number of large bales of native cloth and other articles, which had\nbeen brought to him as presents from time to time by inferior chiefs.  He\nreceived us rather haughtily, but on Bill explaining the nature of our\nerrand he became very condescending, and his eyes glistened with\nsatisfaction when he received the whales' teeth, although he laid them\naside with an assumption of kingly indifference.\n\n\"Go,\" said he, with a wave of the hand,--\"go, tell your captain that he\nmay cut wood to-day, but not to-morrow.  He must come ashore,--I want to\nhave a palaver with him.\"\n\nAs we left the house to return to the woods, Bill shook his head:\n\n\"There's mischief brewin' in that black rascal's head.  I know him of\nold.  But what comes here?\"\n\nAs he spoke, we heard the sound of laughter and shouting in the wood, and\npresently there issued from it a band of savages, in the midst of whom\nwere a number of men bearing burdens on their shoulders.  At first I\nthought that these burdens were poles with something rolled round them,\nthe end of each pole resting on a man's shoulder.  But on a nearer\napproach I saw that they were human beings, tied hand and foot, and so\nlashed to the poles that they could not move.  I counted twenty of them\nas they passed.\n\n\"More murder!\" said Bill, in a voice that sounded between a hoarse laugh\nand a groan.\n\n\"Surely they are not going to murder them?\" said I, looking anxiously\ninto Bill's face.\n\n\"I don't know, Ralph,\" replied Bill, \"what they're goin' to do with them;\nbut I fear they mean no good when they tie fellows up in that way.\"\n\nAs we continued our way towards the wood-cutters, I observed that Bill\nlooked anxiously over his shoulder, in the direction where the procession\nhad disappeared.  At last he stopped, and turning abruptly on his heel,\nsaid,--\n\n\"I tell ye what it is, Ralph, I must be at the bottom o' that affair.  Let\nus follow these black scoundrels and see what they're goin' to do.\"\n\nI must say I had no wish to pry further into their bloody practices; but\nBill seemed bent on it, so I turned and went.  We passed rapidly through\nthe bush, being guided in the right direction by the shouts of the\nsavages.  Suddenly there was a dead silence, which continued for some\ntime, while Bill and I involuntarily quickened our pace until we were\nrunning at the top of our speed across the narrow neck of land previously\nmentioned.  As we reached the verge of the wood, we discovered the\nsavages surrounding the large war-canoe, which they were apparently on\nthe point of launching.  Suddenly the multitude put their united strength\nto the canoe; but scarcely had the huge machine begun to move, when a\nyell, the most appalling that ever fell upon my ear, rose high above the\nshouting of the savages.  It had not died away when another and another\nsmote upon my throbbing ear; and then I saw that these inhuman monsters\nwere actually launching their canoe over the living bodies of their\nvictims.  But there was no pity in the breasts of these men.  Forward\nthey went in ruthless indifference, shouting as they went, while high\nabove their voices rang the dying shrieks of those wretched creatures,\nas, one after another, the ponderous canoe passed over them, burst the\neyeballs from their sockets, and sent the life's blood gushing from their\nmouths.  Oh, reader, this is no fiction.  I would not, for the sake of\nthrilling you with horror, invent so terrible a scene.  It was witnessed.\nIt is true; true as that accursed sin which has rendered the human heart\ncapable of such diabolical enormities!\n\nWhen it was over I turned round and fell upon the grass with a deep\ngroan; but Bill seized me by the arm, and lifting me up as if I had been\na child, cried,--\n\n\"Come along, lad; let's away!\"--and so, staggering and stumbling over the\ntangled underwood, we fled from the fatal spot.\n\nDuring the remainder of that day I felt as if I were in a horrible dream.\nI scarce knew what was said to me, and was more than once blamed by the\nmen for idling my time.  At last the hour to return aboard came.  We\nmarched down to the beach, and I felt relief for the first time when my\nfeet rested on the schooner's deck.\n\nIn the course of the evening I overheard part of a conversation between\nthe captain and the first mate, which startled me not a little.  They\nwere down in the cabin, and conversed in an under-tone, but the sky-light\nbeing off, I overheard every word that was said.\n\n\"I don't half like it,\" said the mate.  \"It seems to me that we'll only\nhave hard fightin' and no pay.\"\n\n\"No pay!\" repeated the captain, in a voice of suppressed anger.  \"Do you\ncall a good cargo all for nothing no pay?\"\n\n\"Very true,\" returned the mate; \"but we've got the cargo aboard.  Why not\ncut your cable and take French leave o' them?  What's the use o' tryin'\nto lick the blackguards when it'll do us no manner o' good?\"\n\n\"Mate,\" said the captain, in a low voice, \"you talk like a fresh-water\nsailor.  I can only attribute this shyness to some strange delusion; for\nsurely\" (his voice assumed a slightly sneering tone as he said this)\n\"surely I am not to suppose that _you_ have become soft-hearted!  Besides,\nyou are wrong in regard to the cargo being aboard; there's a good quarter\nof it lying in the woods, and that blackguard chief knows it and won't\nlet me take it off.  He defied us to do our worst, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Defied us! did he?\" cried the mate, with a bitter laugh.  \"Poor\ncontemptible thing!\"\n\n\"And yet he seems not so contemptible but that you are afraid to attack\nhim.\"\n\n\"Who said I was afraid?\" growled the mate, sulkily.  \"I'm as ready as any\nman in the ship.  But, captain, what is it that you intend to do?\"\n\n\"I intend to muffle the sweeps and row the schooner up to the head of the\ncreek there, from which point we can command the pile of sandal-wood with\nour gun.  Then I shall land with all the men except two, who shall take\ncare of the schooner and be ready with the boat to take us off.  We can\ncreep through the woods to the head of the village, where these cannibals\nare always dancing round their suppers of human flesh, and if the\ncarbines of the men are loaded with a heavy charge of buck-shot, we can\ndrop forty or fifty at the first volley.  After that the thing will be\neasy enough.  The savages will take to the mountains in a body, and we\nshall take what we require, up anchor, and away.\"\n\nTo this plan the mate at length agreed.  As he left the cabin I heard the\ncaptain say,--\n\n\"Give the men an extra glass of grog, and don't forget the buck-shot.\"\n\nThe reader may conceive the horror with which I heard this murderous\nconversation.  I immediately repeated it to Bill, who seemed much\nperplexed about it.  At length he said,--\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do, Ralph: I'll swim ashore after dark and fix a\nmusket to a tree not far from the place where we'll have to land, and\nI'll tie a long string to the trigger, so that when our fellows cross it\nthey'll let it off, and so alarm the village in time to prevent an\nattack, but not in time to prevent us gettin' back to the boat; so,\nmaster captain,\" added Bill with a smile that for the first time seemed\nto me to be mingled with good-natured cheerfulness, \"you'll be baulked at\nleast for once in your life by Bloody Bill.\"\n\nAfter it grew dark, Bill put this resolve in practice.  He slipped over\nthe side with a musket in his left hand, while with his right he swam\nashore and entered the woods.  He soon returned, having accomplished his\npurpose, and got on board without being seen,--I being the only one on\ndeck.\n\nWhen the hour of midnight approached the men were mustered on deck, the\ncable was cut and the muffled sweeps got out.  These sweeps were\nimmensely large oars, each requiring a couple of men to work it.  In a\nfew minutes we entered the mouth of the creek, which was indeed the mouth\nof a small river, and took about half an hour to ascend it, although the\nspot where we intended to land was not more than six hundred yards from\nthe mouth, because there was a slight current against us, and the\nmangroves which narrowed the creek, impeded the rowers in some places.\nHaving reached the spot, which was so darkened by overhanging trees that\nwe could see with difficulty, a small kedge anchor attached to a thin\nline was let softly down over the stern.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" whispered the captain, as he walked along the line of men,\nwho were all armed to the teeth, \"don't be in a hurry, aim low, and don't\nwaste your first shots.\"\n\nHe then pointed to the boat, into which the men crowded in silence.  There\nwas no room to row, but oars were not needed, as a slight push against\nthe side of the schooner sent the boat gliding to the shore.\n\n\"There's no need of leaving two in the boat,\" whispered the mate, as the\nmen stepped out; \"we shall want all our hands.  Let Ralph stay.\"\n\nThe captain assented, and ordered me to stand in readiness with the boat-\nhook, to shove ashore at a moment's notice if they should return, or to\nshove off if any of the savages should happen to approach.  He then threw\nhis carbine into the hollow of his arm and glided through the bushes\nfollowed by his men.  With a throbbing head I awaited the result of our\nplan.  I knew the exact locality where the musket was placed, for Bill\nhad described it to me, and I kept my straining eyes fixed upon the spot.\nBut no sound came, and I began to fear that either they had gone in\nanother direction or that Bill had not fixed the string properly.\nSuddenly I heard a faint click, and observed one or two bright sparks\namong the bushes.  My heart immediately sank within me, for I knew at\nonce that the trigger had indeed been pulled but that the priming had not\ncaught.  The plan, therefore, had utterly failed.  A feeling of dread now\nbegan to creep over me as I stood in the boat, in that dark, silent spot,\nawaiting the issue of this murderous expedition.  I shuddered as I\nglanced at the water that glided past like a dark reptile.  I looked back\nat the schooner, but her hull was just barely visible, while her tapering\nmasts were lost among the trees which overshadowed her.  Her lower sails\nwere set, but so thick was the gloom that they were quite invisible.\n\nSuddenly I heard a shot.  In a moment a thousand voices raised a yell in\nthe village; again the cry rose on the night air, and was followed by\nbroken shouts as of scattered parties of men bounding into the woods.\nThen I heard another shout loud and close at hand.  It was the voice of\nthe captain cursing the man who had fired the premature shot.  Then came\nthe order, \"Forward,\" followed by the wild hurrah of our men, as they\ncharged the savages.  Shots now rang in quick succession, and at last a\nloud volley startled the echoes of the woods.  It was followed by a\nmultitude of wild shrieks, which were immediately drowned in another\n\"hurrah\" from the men; the distance of the sound proving that they were\ndriving their enemies before them towards the sea.\n\nWhile I was listening intently to these sounds, which were now mingled in\nconfusion, I was startled by the rustling of the leaves not far from me.\nAt first I thought it was a party of savages who had observed the\nschooner, but I was speedily undeceived by observing a body of\nnatives--apparently several hundreds, as far as I could guess in the\nuncertain light--bounding through the woods towards the scene of battle.\nI saw at once that this was a party who had out-flanked our men, and\nwould speedily attack them in the rear.  And so it turned out, for, in a\nshort time, the shouts increased ten-fold, and among them I thought I\nheard a death-cry uttered by voices familiar to my ear.\n\nAt length the tumult of battle ceased, and, from the cries of exultation\nthat now arose from the savages, I felt assured that our men had been\nconquered.  I was immediately thrown into dreadful consternation.  What\nwas I now to do?  To be taken by the savages was too horrible to be\nthought of; to flee to the mountains was hopeless, as I should soon be\ndiscovered; and to take the schooner out of the creek without assistance\nwas impossible.  I resolved, however, to make the attempt, as being my\nonly hope, and was on the point of pushing off when my hand was stayed\nand my blood chilled by an appalling shriek in which I recognised the\nvoice of one of the crew.  It was succeeded by a shout from the savages.\nThen came another, and another shriek of agony, making my ears to tingle,\nas I felt convinced they were murdering the pirate crew in cold blood.\nWith a bursting heart and my brain whirling as if on fire, I seized the\nboat-hook to push from shore when a man sprang from the bushes.\n\n\"Stop! Ralph, stop!--there now, push off,\" he cried, and bounded into the\nboat so violently as nearly to upset her.  It was Bill's voice!  In\nanother moment we were on board,--the boat made fast, the line of the\nanchor cut, and the sweeps run out.  At the first stroke of Bill's giant\narm the schooner was nearly pulled ashore, for in his haste he forgot\nthat I could scarcely move the unwieldy oar.  Springing to the stern he\nlashed the rudder in such a position as that, while it aided me, it acted\nagainst him, and so rendered the force of our strokes nearly equal.  The\nschooner now began to glide quickly down the creek, but before we reached\nits mouth, a yell from a thousand voices on the bank told that we were\ndiscovered.  Instantly a number of the savages plunged into the water and\nswam towards us; but we were making so much way that they could not\novertake us.  One, however, an immensely powerful man, succeeded in\nlaying hold of the cut rope that hung from the stern, and clambered\nquickly upon deck.  Bill caught sight of him the instant his head\nappeared above the taffrail.  But he did not cease to row, and did not\nappear even to notice the savage until he was within a yard of him; then,\ndropping the sweep, he struck him a blow on the forehead with his\nclenched fist that felled him to the deck.  Lifting him up he hurled him\noverboard and resumed the oar.  But now a greater danger awaited us, for\nthe savages had outrun us on the bank and were about to plunge into the\nwater ahead of the schooner.  If they succeeded in doing so our fate was\nsealed.  For one moment Bill stood irresolute.  Then, drawing a pistol\nfrom his belt, he sprang to the brass gun, held the pan of his pistol\nover the touch-hole and fired.  The shot was succeeded by the hiss of the\ncannon's priming, then the blaze and the crashing thunder of the\nmonstrous gun burst upon the savages with such deafening roar that it\nseemed as if their very mountains had been rent asunder.\n\nThis was enough.  The moment of surprise and hesitation caused by the\nunwonted sound, gave us time to pass the point; a gentle breeze, which\nthe dense foliage had hitherto prevented us from feeling, bulged out our\nsails; the schooner bent before it, and the shouts of the disappointed\nsavages grew fainter and fainter in the distance as we were slowly wafted\nout to sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\nReflections--The wounded man--The squall--True consolation--Death.\n\nThere is a power of endurance in human beings, both in their bodies and\nin their minds, which, I have often thought, seems to be wonderfully\nadapted and exactly proportioned to the circumstances in which\nindividuals may happen to be placed,--a power which, in most cases, is\nsufficient to carry a man through and over every obstacle that may happen\nto be thrown in his path through life, no matter how high or how steep\nthe mountain may be, but which often forsakes him the moment the summit\nis gained, the point of difficulty passed; and leaves him prostrated,\nwith energies gone, nerves unstrung, and a feeling of incapacity\npervading the entire frame that renders the most trifling effort almost\nimpossible.\n\nDuring the greater part of that day I had been subjected to severe mental\nand much physical excitement, which had almost crushed me down by the\ntime I was relieved from duty in the course of the evening.  But when the\nexpedition, whose failure has just been narrated, was planned, my\nanxieties and energies had been so powerfully aroused that I went through\nthe protracted scenes of that terrible night without a feeling of the\nslightest fatigue.  My mind and body were alike active and full of\nenergy.  No sooner was the last thrilling fear of danger past, however,\nthan my faculties were utterly relaxed; and, when I felt the cool breezes\nof the Pacific playing around my fevered brow, and heard the free waves\nrippling at the schooner's prow, as we left the hated island behind us,\nmy senses forsook me and I fell in a swoon upon the deck.\n\nFrom this state I was quickly aroused by Bill, who shook me by the arm,\nsaying,--\n\n\"Hallo! Ralph, boy, rouse up, lad, we're safe now.  Poor thing, I believe\nhe's fainted.\"  And raising me in his arms he laid me on the folds of the\ngaff-top-sail, which lay upon the deck near the tiller.  \"Here, take a\ndrop o' this, it'll do you good, my boy,\" he added, in a voice of\ntenderness which I had never heard him use before, while he held a brandy-\nflask to my lips.\n\nI raised my eyes gratefully, as I swallowed a mouthful; next moment my\nhead sank heavily upon my arm and I fell fast asleep.  I slept long, for\nwhen I awoke the sun was a good way above the horizon.  I did not move on\nfirst opening my eyes, as I felt a delightful sensation of rest pervading\nme, and my eyes were riveted on and charmed with the gorgeous splendour\nof the mighty ocean, that burst upon my sight.  It was a dead calm; the\nsea seemed a sheet of undulating crystal, tipped and streaked with the\nsaffron hues of sunrise, which had not yet merged into the glowing heat\nof noon; and there was a deep calm in the blue dome above, that was not\nbroken even by the usual flutter of the sea-fowl.  How long I would have\nlain in contemplation of this peaceful scene I know not, but my mind was\nrecalled suddenly and painfully to the past and the present by the sight\nof Bill, who was seated on the deck at my feet with his head reclining,\nas if in sleep, on his right arm, which rested on the tiller.  As he\nseemed to rest peacefully I did not mean to disturb him, but the slight\nnoise I made in raising myself on my elbow caused him to start and look\nround.\n\n\"Well, Ralph, awake at last, my boy; you have slept long and soundly,\" he\nsaid, turning towards me.\n\nOn beholding his countenance I sprang up in anxiety.  He was deadly pale,\nand his hair, which hung in dishevelled locks over his face, was clotted\nwith blood.  Blood also stained his hollow cheeks and covered the front\nof his shirt, which, with the greater part of dress, was torn and soiled\nwith mud.\n\n\"Oh, Bill!\" said I, with deep anxiety, \"what is the matter with you?  You\nare ill.  You must have been wounded.\"\n\n\"Even so, lad,\" said Bill in a deep soft voice, while he extended his\nhuge frame on the couch from which I had just risen.  \"I've got an ugly\nwound, I fear, and I've been waiting for you to waken, to ask you to get\nme a drop o' brandy and a mouthful o' bread from the cabin lockers.  You\nseemed to sleep so sweetly, Ralph, that I didn't like to disturb you.  But\nI don't feel up to much just now.\"\n\nI did not wait till he had done talking, but ran below immediately, and\nreturned in a few seconds with a bottle of brandy and some broken\nbiscuit.  He seemed much refreshed after eating a few morsels and\ndrinking a long draught of water mingled with a little of the spirits.\nImmediately afterwards he fell asleep, and I watched him anxiously until\nhe awoke, being desirous of knowing the nature and extent of his wound.\n\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, on awaking suddenly, after a slumber of an hour, \"I'm\nthe better of that nap, Ralph; I feel twice the man I was;\" and he\nattempted to rise, but sank back again immediately with a deep groan.\n\n\"Nay, Bill you must not move, but lie still while I look at your wound.\nI'll make a comfortable bed for you here on deck, and get you some\nbreakfast.  After that you shall tell me how you got it.  Cheer up,\nBill,\" I added, seeing that he turned his head away; \"you'll be all right\nin a little, and I'll be a capital nurse to you though I'm no doctor.\"\n\nI then left him, and lighted a fire in the caboose.  While it was\nkindling, I went to the steward's pantry and procured the materials for a\ngood breakfast, with which, in little more than half an hour, I returned\nto my companion.  He seemed much better, and smiled kindly on me as I set\nbefore him a cup of coffee and a tray with several eggs and some bread on\nit.\n\n\"Now then, Bill,\" said I, cheerfully, sitting down beside him on the\ndeck, \"let's fall to.  I'm very hungry myself, I can tell you; but--I\nforgot--your wound,\" I added, rising; \"let me look at it.\"\n\nI found that the wound was caused by a pistol shot in the chest.  It did\nnot bleed much, and, as it was on the right side, I was in hopes that it\nmight not be very serious.  But Bill shook his head.  \"However,\" said he,\n\"sit down, Ralph, and I'll tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"You see, after we left the boat an' began to push through the bushes, we\nwent straight for the line of my musket, as I had expected; but by some\nunlucky chance it didn't explode, for I saw the line torn away by the\nmen's legs, and heard the click o' the lock; so I fancy the priming had\ngot damp and didn't catch.  I was in a great quandary now what to do, for\nI couldn't concoct in my mind, in the hurry, any good reason for firin'\noff my piece.  But they say necessity's the mother of invention; so, just\nas I was givin' it up and clinchin' my teeth to bide the worst o't, and\ntake what should come, a sudden thought came into my head.  I stepped out\nbefore the rest, seemin' to be awful anxious to be at the savages,\ntripped my foot on a fallen tree, plunged head foremost into a bush, an',\nov coorse, my carbine exploded!  Then came such a screechin' from the\ncamp as I never heard in all my life.  I rose at once, and was rushin' on\nwith the rest when the captain called a halt.\n\n{The dying pirate: p334.jpg}\n\n\"'You did that a-purpose, you villain!' he said, with a tremendous oath,\nand, drawin' a pistol from his belt, let fly right into my breast.  I\nfell at once, and remembered no more till I was startled and brought\nround by the most awful yell I ever heard in my life, except, maybe, the\nshrieks o' them poor critters that were crushed to death under yon big\ncanoe.  Jumpin' up, I looked round, and, through the trees, saw a fire\ngleamin' not far off, the light o' which showed me the captain and men\ntied hand and foot, each to a post, and the savages dancin' round them\nlike demons.  I had scarce looked for a second, when I saw one o' them go\nup to the captain flourishing a knife, and, before I could wink, he\nplunged it into his breast, while another yell, like the one that roused\nme, rang upon my ear.  I didn't wait for more, but, bounding up, went\ncrashing through the bushes into the woods.  The black fellows caught\nsight of me, however, but not in time to prevent me jumpin' into the\nboat, as you know.\"\n\nBill seemed to be much exhausted after this recital, and shuddered\nfrequently during the narrative, so I refrained from continuing the\nsubject at that time, and endeavoured to draw his mind to other things.\n\n\"But now, Bill,\" said I, \"it behoves us to think about the future, and\nwhat course of action we shall pursue.  Here we are, on the wide Pacific,\nin a well-appointed schooner, which is our own,--at least no one has a\nbetter claim to it than we have,--and the world lies before us.  Moreover,\nhere comes a breeze, so we must make up our minds which way to steer.\"\n\n\"Ralph, boy,\" said my companion, \"it matters not to me which way we go.  I\nfear that my time is short now.  Go where you will.  I'm content.\"\n\n\"Well then, Bill, I think we had better steer to the Coral Island, and\nsee what has become of my dear old comrades, Jack and Peterkin.  I\nbelieve the island has no name, but the captain once pointed it out to me\non the chart, and I marked it afterwards; so, as we know pretty well our\nposition just now, I think I can steer to it.  Then, as to working the\nvessel, it is true I cannot hoist the sails single-handed, but luckily we\nhave enough of sail set already, and if it should come on to blow a\nsquall, I could at least drop the peaks of the main and fore sails, and\nclew them up partially without help, and throw her head close into the\nwind, so as to keep her all shaking till the violence of the squall is\npast.  And if we have continued light breezes, I'll rig up a complication\nof blocks and fix them to the top-sail halyards, so that I shall be able\nto hoist the sails without help.  'Tis true I'll require half a day to\nhoist them, but we don't need to mind that.  Then I'll make a sort of\nerection on deck to screen you from the sun, Bill; and if you can only\nmanage to sit beside the tiller and steer for two hours every day, so as\nto let me get a nap, I'll engage to let you off duty all the rest of the\ntwenty-four hours.  And if you don't feel able for steering, I'll lash\nthe helm and heave to, while I get you your breakfasts and dinners; and\nso we'll manage famously, and soon reach the Coral Island.\"\n\nBill smiled faintly as I ran on in this strain.\n\n\"And what will you do,\" said he, \"if it comes on to blow a storm?\"\n\nThis question silenced me, while I considered what I should do in such a\ncase.  At length I laid my hand an his arm, and said, \"Bill, when a man\nhas done all that he _can_ do, he ought to leave the rest to God.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ralph,\" said my companion, in a faint voice, looking anxiously into\nmy face, \"I wish that I had the feelin's about God that you seem to have,\nat this hour.  I'm dyin', Ralph; yet I, who have braved death a hundred\ntimes, am afraid to die.  I'm afraid to enter the next world.  Something\nwithin tells me there will be a reckoning when I go there.  But it's all\nover with me, Ralph.  I feel that there's no chance o' my bein' saved.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Bill,\" said I, in deep compassion, \"don't say that.  I'm\nquite sure there's hope even for you, but I can't remember the words of\nthe Bible that make me think so.  Is there not a Bible on board, Bill?\"\n\n\"No; the last that was in the ship belonged to a poor boy that was taken\naboard against his will.  He died, poor lad, I think, through ill\ntreatment and fear.  After he was gone the captain found his Bible and\nflung it overboard.\"\n\nI now reflected, with great sadness and self-reproach, on the way in\nwhich I had neglected my Bible; and it flashed across me that I was\nactually in the sight of God a greater sinner than this blood-stained\npirate; for, thought I, he tells me that he never read the Bible, and was\nnever brought up to care for it; whereas I was carefully taught to read\nit by my own mother, and had read it daily as long as I possessed one,\nyet to so little purpose that I could not now call to mind a single text\nthat would meet this poor man's case, and afford him the consolation he\nso much required.  I was much distressed, and taxed my memory for a long\ntime.  At last a text did flash into my mind, and I wondered much that I\nhad not thought of it before.\n\n\"Bill,\" said I, in a low voice, \"'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and\nthou shalt be saved.'\"\n\n\"Ay, Ralph, I've heard the missionaries say that before now, but what\ngood can it do me?  It's not for me that.  It's not for the likes o' me.\"\n\nI knew not now what to say, for, although I felt sure that that word was\nfor him as well as for me, I could not remember any other word whereby I\ncould prove it.\n\nAfter a short pause, Bill raised his eyes to mine and said, \"Ralph, I've\nled a terrible life.  I've been a sailor since I was a boy, and I've gone\nfrom bad to worse ever since I left my father's roof.  I've been a pirate\nthree years now.  It is true I did not choose the trade, but I was\ninveigled aboard this schooner and kept here by force till I became\nreckless and at last joined them.  Since that time my hand has been\nsteeped in human blood again and again.  Your young heart would grow cold\nif I--; but why should I go on?  'Tis of no use, Ralph; my doom is\nfixed.\"\n\n\"Bill,\" said I, \"'Though your sins be red like crimson, they shall be\nwhite as snow.'  'Only believe.'\"\n\n\"Only believe!\" cried Bill, starting up on his elbow; \"I've heard men\ntalk o' believing as if it was easy.  Ha! 'tis easy enough for a man to\npoint to a rope and say, 'I believe that would bear my weight;' but 'tis\nanother thing for a man to catch hold o' that rope, and swing himself by\nit over the edge of a precipice!\"\n\nThe energy with which he said this, and the action with which it was\naccompanied, were too much for Bill.  He sank back with a deep groan.  As\nif the very elements sympathized with this man's sufferings, a low moan\ncame sweeping over the sea.\n\n\"Hist! Ralph,\" said Bill, opening his eves; \"there's a squall coming,\nlad.  Look alive, boy.  Clew up the fore-sail.  Drop the main-sail peak.\nThem squalls come quick sometimes.\"\n\nI had already started to my feet, and saw that a heavy squall was indeed\nbearing down on us.  It had hitherto escaped my notice, owing to my being\nso much engrossed by our conversation.  I instantly did as Bill desired,\nfor the schooner was still lying motionless on the glassy sea.  I\nobserved with some satisfaction that the squall was bearing down on the\nlarboard bow, so that it would strike the vessel in the position in which\nshe would be best able to stand the shock.  Having done my best to\nshorten sail, I returned aft, and took my stand at the helm.\n\n\"Now, boy,\" said Bill, in a faint voice, \"keep her close to the wind.\"\n\nA few seconds afterwards he said, \"Ralph, let me hear those two texts\nagain.\"\n\nI repeated them.\n\n\"Are ye sure, lad, ye saw them in the Bible?\"\n\n\"Quite sure,\" I replied.\n\nAlmost before the words had left my lips the wind burst upon us, and the\nspray dashed over our decks.  For a time the schooner stood it bravely,\nand sprang forward against the rising sea like a war-horse.  Meanwhile\nclouds darkened the sky, and the sea began to rise in huge billows.  There\nwas still too much sail on the schooner, and, as the gale increased, I\nfeared that the masts would be torn out of her or carried away, while the\nwind whistled and shrieked through the strained rigging.  Suddenly the\nwind shifted a point, a heavy sea struck us on the bow, and the schooner\nwas almost laid on her beam-ends, so that I could scarcely keep my legs.\nAt the same moment Bill lost his hold of the belaying-pin which had\nserved to steady him, and he slid with stunning violence against the sky-\nlight.  As he lay on the deck close beside me, I could see that the shock\nhad rendered him insensible, but I did not dare to quit the tiller for an\ninstant, as it required all my faculties, bodily and mental, to manage\nthe schooner.  For an hour the blast drove us along, while, owing to the\nsharpness of the vessel's bow and the press of canvass, she dashed\nthrough the waves instead of breasting over them, thereby drenching the\ndecks with water fore and aft.  At the end of that time the squall passed\naway, and left us rocking on the bosom of the agitated sea.\n\nMy first care, the instant I could quit the helm, was to raise Bill from\nthe deck and place him on the couch.  I then ran below for the brandy\nbottle and rubbed his face and hands with it, and endeavoured to pour a\nlittle down his throat.  But my efforts, although I continued them long\nand assiduously, were of no avail; as I let go the hand which I had been\nchafing it fell heavily on the deck.  I laid my hand over his heart, and\nsat for some time quite motionless, but there was no flutter there--the\npirate was dead!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\nAlone on the deep--Necessity the mother of invention--A valuable book\ndiscovered--Natural phenomenon--A bright day in my history.\n\nIt was with feelings of awe, not unmingled with fear, that I now seated\nmyself on the cabin sky-light and gazed upon the rigid features of my\nlate comrade, while my mind wandered over his past history and\ncontemplated with anxiety my present position.  Alone! in the midst of\nthe wide Pacific, having a most imperfect knowledge of navigation, and in\na schooner requiring at least eight men as her proper crew.  But I will\nnot tax the reader's patience with a minute detail of my feelings and\ndoings during the first few days that followed the death of my companion.\nI will merely mention that I tied a cannon ball to his feet and, with\nfeelings of the deepest sorrow, consigned him to the deep.\n\nFor fully a week after that a steady breeze blew from the east, and, as\nmy course lay west-and-by-north, I made rapid progress towards my\ndestination.  I could not take an observation, which I very much\nregretted, as the captain's quadrant was in the cabin; but, from the day\nof setting sail from the island of the savages, I had kept a dead\nreckoning, and as I knew pretty well now how much lee-way the schooner\nmade, I hoped to hit the Coral Island without much difficulty.  In this I\nwas the more confident that I knew its position on the chart (which I\nunderstood was a very good one), and so had its correct bearings by\ncompass.\n\nAs the weather seemed now quite settled and fine, and as I had got into\nthe trade-winds, I set about preparations for hoisting the top-sails.\nThis was a most arduous task, and my first attempts were complete\nfailures, owing, in a great degree, to my reprehensible ignorance of\nmechanical forces.  The first error I made was in applying my apparatus\nof blocks and pulleys to a rope which was too weak, so that the very\nfirst heave I made broke it in two, and sent me staggering against the\nafter-hatch, over which I tripped, and, striking against the main-boom,\ntumbled down the companion ladder into the cabin.  I was much bruised and\nsomewhat stunned by this untoward accident.  However, I considered it\nfortunate that I was not killed.  In my next attempt I made sure of not\ncoming by a similar accident, so I unreeved the tackling and fitted up\nlarger blocks and ropes.  But although the principle on which I acted was\nquite correct, the machinery was now so massive and heavy that the mere\nfriction and stiffness of the thick cordage prevented me from moving it\nat all.  Afterwards, however, I came to proportion things more correctly;\nbut I could not avoid reflecting at the time how much better it would\nhave been had I learned all this from observation and study, instead of\nwaiting till I was forced to acquire it through the painful and tedious\nlessons of experience.\n\nAfter the tackling was prepared and in good working order, it took me the\ngreater part of a day to hoist the main-top sail.  As I could not steer\nand work at this at the same time, I lashed the helm in such a position\nthat, with a little watching now and then, it kept the schooner in her\nproper course.  By this means I was enabled also to go about the deck and\ndown below for things that I wanted, as occasion required; also to cook\nand eat my victuals.  But I did not dare to trust to this plan during the\nthree hours of rest that I allowed myself at night, as the wind might\nhave shifted, in which case I should have been blown far out of my course\nere I awoke.  I was, therefore, in the habit of heaving-to during those\nthree hours; that is, fixing the rudder and the sails in such a position\nas that by acting against each other, they would keep the ship\nstationary.  After my night's rest, therefore, I had only to make\nallowance for the lee-way she had made, and so resume my course.\n\nOf course I was to some extent anxious lest another squall should come,\nbut I made the best provision I could in the circumstances, and concluded\nthat by letting go the weather-braces of the top-sails and the top-sail\nhalyards at the same time, I should thereby render these sails almost\npowerless.  Besides this, I proposed to myself to keep a sharp look-out\non the barometer in the cabin, and if I observed at any time a sudden\nfall in it, I resolved that I would instantly set about my multiform\nappliances for reducing sail, so as to avoid being taken at unawares.\nThus I sailed prosperously for two weeks, with a fair wind, so that I\ncalculated I must be drawing near to the Coral Island; at the thought of\nwhich my heart bounded with joyful expectation.\n\nThe only book I found on board, after a careful search, was a volume of\nCaptain Cook's voyages.  This, I suppose, the pirate captain had brought\nwith him in order to guide him, and to furnish him with information\nregarding the islands of these seas.  I found this a most delightful book\nindeed, and I not only obtained much interesting knowledge about the sea\nin which I was sailing, but I had many of my own opinions, derived from\nexperience, corroborated; and not a few of them corrected.  Besides the\nreading of this charming book, and the daily routine of occupations,\nnothing of particular note happened to me during this voyage, except\nonce, when on rising one night, after my three hours' nap, while it was\nyet dark, I was amazed and a little alarmed to find myself floating in\nwhat appeared to be a sea of blue fire!  I had often noticed the\nbeautiful appearance of phosphorescent light, but this far exceeded\nanything of the sort I ever saw before.  The whole sea appeared somewhat\nlike milk and was remarkably luminous.\n\nI rose in haste, and, letting down a bucket into the sea, brought some of\nthe water on board and took it down to the cabin to examine it; but no\nsooner did I approach the light than the strange appearance disappeared,\nand when I removed the cabin lamp the luminous light appeared again.  I\nwas much puzzled with this, and took up a little of the water in the\nhollow of my hand and then let it run off, when I found that the luminous\nsubstance was left behind on my palm.  I ran with it to the lamp; but\nwhen I got there it was gone.  I found, however, that when I went into\nthe dark my hand shone again; so I took the large glass of the ship's\ntelescope and examined my hand minutely, when I found that there were on\nit one or two small patches of a clear, transparent substance like jelly,\nwhich were so thin as to be almost invisible to the naked eye.  Thus I\ncame to know that the beautiful phosphoric light, which I had so often\nadmired before, was caused by animals, for I had no doubt that these were\nof the same kind as the medusae or jelly-fish which are seen in all parts\nof the world.\n\nOn the evening of my fourteenth day, I was awakened out of a nap into\nwhich I had fallen by a loud cry, and starting up, I gazed around me.  I\nwas surprised and delighted to see a large albatross soaring majestically\nover the ship.  I immediately took it into my head that this was the\nalbatross I had seen at Penguin Island.  I had, of course, no good reason\nfor supposing this, but the idea occurred to me, I know not why, and I\ncherished it, and regarded the bird with as much affection as if he had\nbeen an old friend.  He kept me company all that day and left me as night\nfell.\n\nNext morning as I stood motionless and with heavy eyes at the helm, for I\nhad not slept well, I began to weary anxiously for day-light, and peered\ntowards the horizon, where I thought I observed something like a black\ncloud against the dark sky.  Being always on the alert for squalls, I ran\nto the bow.  There could be no doubt it was a squall, and as I listened I\nthought I heard the murmur of the coming gale.  Instantly I began to work\nmight and main at my cumbrous tackle for shortening sail, and in the\ncourse of an hour and a half had the most of it reduced,--the top-sail\nyards down on the caps, the top-sails clewed up, the sheets hauled in,\nthe main and fore peaks lowered, and the flying-jib down.  While thus\nengaged the dawn advanced, and I cast an occasional furtive glance ahead\nin the midst of my labour.  But now that things were prepared for the\nworst, I ran forward again and looked anxiously over the bow.  I now\nheard the roar of the waves distinctly, and as a single ray of the rising\nsun gleamed over the ocean I saw--what! could it be that I was\ndreaming?--that magnificent breaker with its ceaseless roar!--that\nmountain top!--yes, once more I beheld the Coral Island!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nThe effect of a cannon-shot--A happy reunion of a somewhat moist\nnature--Retrospects and explanations--An awful dive--New plans--The last\nof the Coral Island.\n\nI almost fell upon the deck with the tumult of mingled emotions that\nfilled my heart, as I gazed ardently towards my beautiful island.  It was\nstill many miles away, but sufficiently near to enable me to trace\ndistinctly the well-remembered outlines of the two mountains.  My first\nimpulse was to utter an exclamation of gratitude for being carried to my\nformer happy home in safety; my second, to jump up, clap my hands, shout,\nand run up and down the deck, with no other object in view than that of\ngiving vent to my excited feelings.  Then I went below for the telescope,\nand spent nearly ten minutes of the utmost impatience in vainly trying to\nget a focus, and in rubbing the skin nearly off my eyes, before I\ndiscovered that having taken off the large glass to examine the\nphosphoric water with I had omitted to put it on again.\n\nAfter that I looked up impatiently at the sails, which I now regretted\nhaving lowered so hastily, and for a moment thought of hoisting the main-\ntop sail again; but recollecting that it would take me full half a day to\naccomplish, and that, at the present rate of sailing, two hours would\nbring me to the island, I immediately dismissed the idea.\n\nThe remainder of the time I spent in making feverish preparations for\narriving and seeing my dear comrades.  I remembered that they were not in\nthe habit of rising before six, and, as it was now only three, I hoped to\narrive before they were awake.  Moreover, I set about making ready to let\ngo the anchor, resolving in my own mind that, as I knew the depth of\nwater in the passage of the reef and within the lagoon, I would run the\nschooner in and bring up opposite the bower.  Fortunately the anchor was\nhanging at the cat-head, otherwise I should never have been able to use\nit.  Now, I had only to cut the tackling, and it would drop of its own\nweight.  After searching among the flags, I found the terrible black one,\nwhich I ran up to the peak.  While I was doing this, a thought struck me.\nI went to the powder magazine, brought up a blank cartridge and loaded\nthe big brass gun, which, it will be remembered, was unhoused when we set\nsail, and, as I had no means of housing it, there it had stood, bristling\nalike at fair weather and foul all the voyage.  I took care to grease its\nmouth well, and, before leaving the fore part of the ship, thrust the\npoker into the fire.\n\n{A terrible surprise: p352.jpg}\n\nAll was now ready.  A steady five-knot breeze was blowing, so that I was\nnow not more than quarter of a mile from the reef.  I was soon at the\nentrance, and, as the schooner glided quietly through, I glanced\naffectionately at the huge breaker, as if it had been the same one I had\nseen there when I bade adieu, as I feared for ever, to the island.  On\ncoming opposite the Water Garden, I put the helm hard down.  The schooner\ncame round with a rapid, graceful bend, and lost way just opposite the\nbower.  Running forward, I let go the anchor, caught up the red-hot\npoker, applied it to the brass gun, and the mountains with a _bang_, such\nas had only once before broke their slumbering echoes!\n\nEffective although it was, however, it was scarcely equal to the bang\nwith which, instantly after, Peterkin bounded from the bower, in scanty\ncostume, his eye-balls starting from his head with surprise and terror.\nOne gaze he gave, one yell, and then fled into the bushes like a wild\ncat.  The next moment Jack went through exactly the same performance, the\nonly difference being, that his movements were less like those of Jack-in-\nthe-box, though not less vigorous and rapid than those of Peterkin.\n\n\"Hallo!\" I shouted, almost mad with joy, \"what, ho! Peterkin!  Jack!\nhallo! it's me!\"\n\nMy shout was just in time to arrest them.  They halted and turned round,\nand, the instant I repeated the cry, I saw that they recognised my voice,\nby both of them running at full speed towards the beach.  I could no\nlonger contain myself.  Throwing off my jacket, I jumped overboard at the\nsame moment that Jack bounded into the sea.  In another moment we met in\ndeep water, clasped each other round the neck, and sank, as a matter of\ncourse, to the bottom!  We were well-nigh choked, and instantly struggled\nto the surface, where Peterkin was spluttering about like a wounded duck,\nlaughing and crying by turns, and choking himself with salt water!\n\nIt would be impossible to convey to my reader, by description, an\nadequate conception of the scene that followed my landing on the beach,\nas we stood embracing each other indiscriminately in our dripping\ngarments, and giving utterance to incoherent rhapsodies, mingled with\nwild shouts.  It can be more easily imagined than described, so I will\ndraw a curtain over this part of my history, and carry the reader forward\nover an interval of three days.\n\nDuring the greater part of that period Peterkin did nothing but roast\npigs, taro, and bread-fruit, and ply me with plantains, plums, potatoes,\nand cocoa-nuts, while I related to him and Jack the terrible and\nwonderful adventures I had gone through since we last met.  After I had\nfinished the account, they made me go all over it again; and, when I had\nconcluded the second recital, I had to go over it again, while they\ncommented upon it piecemeal.  They were much affected by what I told them\nof the probable fate of Avatea, and Peterkin could by no means brook the\nidea of the poor girl being converted into a _long pig_!  As for Jack, he\nclenched his teeth, and shook his fist towards the sea, saying at the\nsame time, that he was sorry he had not broken Tararo's head, and he only\nhoped that one day he should be able to plant his knuckles on the bridge\nof that chief's nose!  After they had \"pumped me dry,\" as Peterkin said,\nI begged to be informed of what had happened to them during my long\nabsence, and particularly as to how they got out of the Diamond Cave.\n\n\"Well, you must know,\" began Jack, \"after you had dived out of the cave,\non the day you were taken away from us, we waited very patiently for half\nan hour, not expecting you to return before the end of that time.  Then\nwe began to upbraid you for staying so long, when you knew we would be\nanxious; but when an hour passed, we became alarmed, and I resolved at\nall hazards to dive out, and see what had become of you, although I felt\nfor poor Peterkin, because, as he truly said, 'If you never come back,\nI'm shut up here for life.'  However, I promised not to run any risk, and\nhe let me go; which, to say truth, I thought very courageous of him!\"\n\n\"I should just think it was!\" interrupted Peterkin, looking at Jack over\nthe edge of a monstrous potato which he happened to be devouring at the\ntime.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Jack, \"you may guess my consternation when you did not\nanswer to my halloo.  At first I imagined that the pirates must have\nkilled you, and left you in the bush, or thrown you into the sea; then it\noccurred to me that this would have served no end of theirs, so I came to\nthe conclusion that they must have carried you away with them.  As this\nthought struck me, I observed the pirate schooner standing away to the\nnor'ard, almost hull-down on the horizon, and I sat down on the rocks to\nwatch her as she slowly sank from my sight.  And I tell you, Ralph, my\nboy, that I shed more tears that time, at losing you, than I have done, I\nverify believe, all my life before--\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Jack, for interrupting,\" said Peterkin; \"surely you must be\nmistaken in that; you've often told me that, when you were a baby, you\nused to howl and roar from morning to--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Peterkin,\" cried Jack.  \"Well, after the schooner had\ndisappeared, I dived back into the cave, much to Peterkin's relief, and\ntold him what I had seen.  We sat down and had a long talk over this\nmatter, and then we agreed to make a regular, systematic search through\nthe woods, so as to make sure, at least, that you had not been killed.\nBut now we thought of the difficulty of getting out of the cave without\nyour help.  Peterkin became dreadfully nervous when he thought of this;\nand I must confess that I felt some alarm, for, of course, I could not\nhope alone to take him out so quickly as we two together had brought him\nin; and he himself vowed that, if we had been a moment longer with him\nthat time, he would have had to take a breath of salt water.  However,\nthere was no help for it, and I endeavoured to calm his fears as well as\nI could: 'for,' said I, 'you can't live here, Peterkin;' to which he\nreplied, 'Of course not, Jack, I can only die here, and, as that's not at\nall desirable, you had better propose something.'  So I suggested that he\nshould take a good long breath, and trust himself to me.\n\n\"'Might we not make a large bag of cocoa-nut cloth, into which I could\nshove my head, and tie it tight round my neck?' he asked, with a haggard\nsmile.  'It might let me get one breath under water!'\n\n\"'No use,' said I; 'it would fill in a moment and suffocate you.  I see\nnothing for it, Peterkin, if you really can't keep your breath so long,\nbut to let me knock you down, and carry you out while in a state of\ninsensibility.'\n\n\"But Peterkin didn't relish this idea.  He seemed to fear that I could\nnot be able to measure the exact force of the blow, and might, on the one\nhand, hit him so softly as to render a second or third blow necessary,\nwhich would be very uncomfortable; or, on the other hand, give him such a\nsmash as would entirely spoil his figure-head, or, mayhap, knock the life\nout of him altogether!  At last I got him persuaded to try to hold his\nbreath, and commit himself to me; so he agreed, and down we went.  But I\nhad not got him half way through, when he began to struggle and kick like\na wild bull, burst from my grasp, and hit against the roof of the tunnel.\nI was therefore, obliged to force him violently back into the cave gain,\nwhere he rose panting to the surface.  In short, he had lost his presence\nof mind, and--\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" cried Peterkin, indignantly, \"I had only lost my\nwind; and if I had not had presence of mind enough to kick as I did, I\nshould have bu'st in your arms!\"\n\n\"Well, well, so be it,\" resumed Jack, with a smile, \"but the upshot of it\nwas, that we had to hold another consultation on the point, and I really\nbelieve that, had it not been for a happy thought of mine, we should have\nbeen consulting there yet.\"\n\n\"I wish we had,\" again interrupted Peterkin with a sigh.  \"I'm sure,\nRalph, if I had thought that you were coming back again, I would\nwillingly have awaited your return for months, rather than have endured\nthe mental agony which I went through!  But proceed.\"\n\n\"The thought was this,\" continued Jack, \"that I should tie Peterkin's\nhands and feet with cords, and then lash him firmly to a stout pole about\nfive feet long, in order to render him quite powerless, and keep him\nstraight and stiff.  You should have seen his face of horror, Ralph, when\nI suggested this: but he came to see that it was his only chance, and\ntold me to set about it as fast as I could; 'for,' said he, 'this is no\njokin', Jack, _I_ can tell you, and the sooner it's done the better.'  I\nsoon procured the cordage and a suitable pole, with which I returned to\nthe cave, and lashed him as stiff and straight as an Egyptian mummy; and,\nto say truth, he was no bad representation of what an English mummy would\nbe, if there were such things, for he was as white as a dead man.\"\n\n\"'Now,' said Peterkin, in a tremulous voice, 'swim with me as near to the\nedge of the hole as you can before you dive, then let me take a long\nbreath, and, as I sha'nt be able to speak after I've taken it, you'll\nwatch my face, and the moment you see me wink--dive!  And oh!' he added,\nearnestly, 'pray don't be long!'\n\n\"I promised to pay the strictest attention to his wishes, and swam with\nhim to the outlet of the cave.  Here I paused.  'Now then,' said I, 'pull\naway at the wind, lad.'\"\n\nPeterkin drew in a breath so long that I could not help thinking of the\nfrog in the fable, that wanted to swell itself as big as the ox.  Then I\nlooked into his face earnestly.  Slap went the lid of his right eye; down\nwent my head, and up went my heels.  We shot through the passage like an\narrow, and rose to the surface of the open sea before you could count\ntwenty!\n\n\"Peterkin had taken in such an awful load of wind that, on reaching the\nfree air, he let it out with a yell loud enough to have been heard a mile\noff, and then, the change in his feelings was so sudden and great, that\nhe did not wait till we landed, but began, tied up as he was, to shout\nand sing for joy as I supported him with my left arm to the shore.\nHowever, in the middle of a laugh that a hyaena might have envied, I let\nhim accidentally slip, which extinguished him in a moment.\n\n\"After this happy deliverance, we immediately began our search for your\ndead body, Ralph, and you have no idea how low our hearts sank as we set\noff, day after day, to examine the valleys and mountain sides with the\nutmost care.  In about three weeks we completed the survey of the whole\nisland, and had at least the satisfaction of knowing that you had not\nbeen killed.  But it occurred to us that you might have been thrown into\nthe sea, so we examined the sands and the lagoon carefully, and\nafterwards went all round the outer reef.  One day, while we were upon\nthe reef, Peterkin espied a small dark object lying among the rocks,\nwhich seemed to be quite different from the surrounding stones.  We\nhastened towards the spot, and found it to be a small keg.  On knocking\nout the head we discovered that it was gunpowder.\"\n\n\"It was I who sent you that, Jack,\" said I, with a smile.\n\n\"Fork out!\" cried Peterkin, energetically, starting to his feet and\nextending his open hand to Jack.  \"Down with the money, sir, else I'll\nhave you shut up for life in a debtor's prison the moment we return to\nEngland!\"\n\n\"I'll give you an I.O.U. in the meantime,\" returned Jack, laughing, \"so\nsit down and be quiet.  The fact is, Ralph, when we discovered this keg\nof powder, Peterkin immediately took me a bet of a thousand pounds that\nyou had something to do with it, and I took him a bet of ten thousand\nthat you had not.\n\n\"Peterkin was right then,\" said I, explaining how the thing had occurred.\n\n\"Well, we found it very useful,\" continued Jack; \"although some of it had\ngot a little damp; and we furbished up the old pistol, with which\nPeterkin is a crack shot now.  But, to continue.  We did not find any\nother vestige of you on the reef, and, finally, gave up all hope of ever\nseeing you again.  After this the island became a dreary place to us, and\nwe began to long for a ship to heave in sight and take us off.  But now\nthat you're back again, my dear fellow, it looks as bright and cheerful\nas it used to do, and I love it as much as ever.\"\n\n\"And now,\" continued Jack, \"I have a great desire to visit some of the\nother islands of the South Seas.  Here we have a first-rate schooner at\nour disposal, so I don't see what should hinder us.\"\n\n\"Just the very thing I was going to propose,\" cried Peterkin; \"I vote for\nstarting at once.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Jack, \"it seems to me that we could not do better than\nshape our course for the island on which Avatea lives, and endeavour to\npersuade Tararo to let her marry the black fellow to whom she is engaged,\ninstead of making a long pig of her.  If he has a spark of gratitude in\nhim he'll do it.  Besides, having become champions for this girl once\nbefore, it behoves us, as true knights, not to rest until we set her\nfree; at least, all the heroes in all the story-books I have ever read\nwould count it foul disgrace to leave such a work unfinished.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, or care, what your knights in story-books would\ndo,\" said Peterkin, \"but I'm certain that it would be capital fun, so I'm\nyour man whenever you want me.\"\n\nThis plan of Jack's was quite in accordance with his romantic, impulsive\nnature; and, having made up his mind to save this black girl, he could\nnot rest until the thing was commenced.\n\n\"But there may be great danger in this attempt,\" he said, at the end of a\nlong consultation on the subject; \"will you, lads, go with me in spite of\nthis?\"\n\n\"Go with you?\" we repeated in the same breath.\n\n\"Can you doubt it?\" said I.\n\n\"For a moment,\" added Peterkin.\n\nI need scarcely say that, having made up our minds to go on this\nenterprise, we lost no time in making preparations to quit the island;\nand as the schooner was well laden with stores of every kind for a long\ncruise, we had little to do except to add to our abundant supply a\nquantity of cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, taro, yams, plums, and potatoes,\nchiefly with the view of carrying the fragrance of our dear island along\nwith us as long as we could.\n\nWhen all was ready, we paid a farewell visit to the different familiar\nspots where most of our time had been spent.  We ascended the mountain\ntop, and gazed for the last time at the rich green foliage in the\nvalleys, the white sandy beach, the placid lagoon, and the barrier coral-\nreef with its crested breakers.  Then we descended to Spouting Cliff, and\nlooked down at the pale-green monster which we had made such fruitless\nefforts to spear in days gone by.  From this we hurried to the Water\nGarden and took a last dive into its clear waters, and a last gambol\namongst its coral groves.  I hurried out before my companions, and\ndressed in haste, in order to have a long examination of my tank, which\nPeterkin, in the fulness of his heart, had tended with the utmost care,\nas being a vivid remembrancer of me, rather than out of love for natural\nhistory.  It was in superb condition;--the water as clear and pellucid as\ncrystal; the red and green sea-weed of the most brilliant hues; the red,\npurple, yellow, green, and striped anemones fully expanded, and\nstretching out their arms as if to welcome and embrace their former\nmaster; the starfish, zoophytes, sea-pens, and other innumerable marine\ninsects, looking fresh and beautiful; and the crabs, as Peterkin said,\nlooking as wide awake, impertinent, rampant, and pugnacious as ever.  It\nwas indeed so lovely and so interesting that I would scarcely allow\nmyself to be torn away from it.\n\nLast of all, we returned to the bower and collected the few articles we\npossessed, such as the axe, the pencil-case, the broken telescope, the\npen-knife, the hook made from the brass ring, and the sail-needle, with\nwhich we had landed on the island;--also, the long boots and the pistol,\nbesides several curious articles of costume which we had manufactured\nfrom time to time.\n\nThese we conveyed on board in our little boat, after having carved our\nnames on a chip of iron-wood, thus:--\n\n   JACK MARTIN,\n   RALPH ROVER,\n   PETERKIN GAY,\n\nwhich we fixed up inside of the bower.  The boat was then hoisted on\nboard and the anchor weighed; which latter operation cost us great labour\nand much time, as the anchor was so heavy that we could not move it\nwithout the aid of my complex machinery of blocks and pulleys.  A steady\nbreeze was blowing off shore when we set sail, at a little before sunset.\nIt swept us quickly past the reef and out to sea.  The shore grew rapidly\nmore indistinct as the shades of evening fell, while our clipper bark\nbounded lightly over the waves.  Slowly the mountain top sank on the\nhorizon, until it became a mere speck.  In another moment the sun and the\nCoral Island sank together into the broad bosom of the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\nThe voyage--The island, and a consultation in which danger is scouted as\na thing unworthy of consideration--Rats and cats--The native\nteacher--Awful revelations--Wonderful effects of Christianity.\n\nOur voyage during the next two weeks was most interesting and prosperous.\nThe breeze continued generally fair, and at all times enabled us to lie\nour course; for being, as I have said before, clipper-built, the pirate\nschooner could lie very close to the wind, and made little lee-way.  We\nhad no difficulty now in managing our sails, for Jack was heavy and\npowerful, while Peterkin was active as a kitten.  Still, however, we were\na very insufficient crew for such a vessel, and if any one had proposed\nto us to make such a voyage in it before we had been forced to go through\nso many hardships from necessity, we would have turned away with pity\nfrom the individual making such proposal as from a madman.  I pondered\nthis a good deal, and at last concluded that men do not know how much\nthey are capable of doing till they try, and that we should never give\nway to despair in any undertaking, however difficult it may seem:--always\nsupposing, however, that our cause is a good one, and that we can ask the\ndivine blessing on it.\n\nAlthough, therefore, we could now manage our sails easily, we\nnevertheless found that my pulleys were of much service to us in some\nthings; though Jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth arrangement of\nropes and blocks, which had, to a sailor's eye, a very lumbering and\nclumsy appearance.  But I will not drag my reader through the details of\nthis voyage.  Suffice it to say, that, after an agreeable sail of about\nthree weeks, we arrived off the island of Mango, which I recognised at\nonce from the description that the pirate, Bill, had given me of it\nduring one of our conversations.\n\nAs soon as we came within sight of it we hove the ship to, and held a\ncouncil of war.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" said Jack, as we seated ourselves beside him on the cabin\nsky-light, \"before we go farther in this business, we must go over the\npros and cons of it; for, although you have so generously consented to\nstick by me through thick and thin, it would be unfair did I not see that\nyou thoroughly understand the danger of what we are about to attempt.\"\n\n\"Oh! bother the danger,\" cried Peterkin; \"I wonder to hear _you_, Jack,\ntalk of danger.  When a fellow begins to talk about it, he'll soon come\nto magnify it to such a degree that he'll not be fit to face it when it\ncomes, no more than a suckin' baby!\"\n\n\"Nay, Peterkin,\" replied Jack, gravely, \"I won't be jested out of it.  I\ngrant you, that, when we've once resolved to act, and have made up our\nminds what to do, we should think no more of danger.  But, before we have\nso resolved, it behoves us to look at it straight in the face, and\nexamine into it, and walk round it; for if we flinch at a distant view,\nwe're sure to run away when the danger is near.  Now, I understand from\nyou, Ralph, that the island is inhabited by thorough-going, out-and-out\ncannibals, whose principal law is--'Might is right, and the weakest goes\nto the wall?'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"so Bill gave me to understand.  He told me, however,\nthat, at the southern side of it, the missionaries had obtained a footing\namongst an insignificant tribe.  A native teacher had been sent there by\nthe Wesleyans, who had succeeded in persuading the chief at that part to\nembrace Christianity.  But instead of that being of any advantage to our\nenterprise, it seems the very reverse; for the chief Tararo is a\ndetermined heathen, and persecutes the Christians,--who are far too weak\nin numbers to offer any resistance,--and looks with dislike upon all\nwhite men, whom he regards as propagators of the new faith.\"\n\n\"'Tis a pity,\" said Jack, \"that the Christian tribe is so small, for we\nshall scarcely be safe under their protection, I fear.  If Tararo takes\nit into his head to wish for our vessel, or to kill ourselves, he could\ntake us from them by force.  You say that the native missionary talks\nEnglish?\"\n\n\"So I believe.\"\n\n\"Then, what I propose is this,\" said Jack: \"We will run round to the\nsouth side of the island, and cut anchor off the Christian village.  We\nare too far away just now to have been descried by any of the savages, so\nwe shall get there unobserved, and have time to arrange our plans before\nthe heathen tribes know of our presence.  But, in doing this, we run the\nrisk of being captured by the ill-disposed tribes, and being very ill\nused, if not--a--\"\n\n\"Roasted alive and eaten,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Come, out with it, Jack;\naccording to your own showing, it's well to look the danger straight in\nthe face!\"\n\n\"Well, that is the worst of it, certainly.  Are you prepared, then, to\ntake your chance of that?\"\n\n\"I've been prepared and had my mind made up long ago,\" cried Peterkin,\nswaggering about the deck with his hands thrust into his breeches'\npockets.  \"The fact is, Jack, I don't believe that Tararo will be so\nungrateful as to eat us; and I'm quite sure that he'll be too happy to\ngrant us whatever we ask: so the sooner we go in and win the better.\"\n\nPeterkin was wrong, however, in his estimate of savage gratitude, as the\nsequel will show.\n\nThe schooner was now put before the wind, and, after making a long run to\nthe south'ard, we put about and beat up for the south side of Mango,\nwhere we arrived before sunset, and hove-to off the coral reef.  Here we\nawaited the arrival of a canoe, which immediately put off on our rounding\nto.  When it arrived, a mild-looking native, of apparently forty years of\nage, came on board, and, taking off his straw hat, made us a low bow.  He\nwas clad in a respectable suit of European clothes; and the first words\nhe uttered, as he stepped up to Jack and shook hands with him, were,--\n\n\"Good day, gentlemen; we are happy to see you at Mango--you are heartily\nwelcome.\"\n\nAfter returning his salutation, Jack exclaimed, \"You must be the native\nmissionary teacher of whom I have heard--are you not?\"\n\n\"I am.  I have the joy to be a servant of the Lord Jesus at this\nstation.\"\n\n\"You're the very man I want to see, then,\" replied Jack; \"that's lucky.\nCome down to the cabin, friend, and have a glass of wine.  I wish\nparticularly to speak with you.  My men there\" (pointing to Peterkin and\nme) \"will look after your people.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the teacher, as he followed Jack to the cabin, \"I do\nnot drink wine or any strong drink.\"\n\n\"Oh! then, there's lots of water, and you can have biscuit.\"\n\n\"Now, 'pon my word, that's cool!\" said Peterkin; \"his _men_, forsooth!\nWell, since we are to be men, we may as well come it as strong over these\nblack chaps as we can.  Hallo, there!\" he cried to the half dozen of\nnatives who stood upon the deck, gazing in wonder at all they saw,\n\"here's for you;\" and he handed them a tray of broken biscuit and a can\nof water.  Then, thrusting his hands into his pockets, he walked up and\ndown the deck with an enormous swagger, whistling vociferously.\n\nIn about half an hour Jack and the teacher came on deck, and the latter,\nbidding us a cheerful good evening, entered his canoe and paddled to the\nshore.  When he was gone, Peterkin stepped up to Jack, and, touching his\ncap, said,--\n\n\"Well, captain, have you any communications to make to your _men_?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Jack; \"ready about, mind the helm and clew up your tongue,\nwhile I con the schooner through the passage in the reef.  The teacher,\nwho seems a first-rate fellow, says it's quite deep, and good anchorage\nwithin the lagoon close to the shore.\"\n\nWhile the vessel was slowly advancing to her anchorage, under a light\nbreeze, Jack explained to us that Avatea was still on the island, living\namongst the heathens; that she had expressed a strong desire to join the\nChristians, but Tararo would not let her, and kept her constantly in\nclose confinement.\n\n\"Moreover,\" continued Jack, \"I find that she belongs to one of the Samoan\nIslands, where Christianity had been introduced long before her capture\nby the heathens of a neighbouring island; and the very day after she was\ntaken, she was to have joined the church which had been planted there by\nthat excellent body, the London Missionary Society.  The teacher tells\nme, too, that the poor girl has fallen in love with a Christian chief,\nwho lives on an island some fifty miles or so to the south of this one,\nand that she is meditating a desperate attempt at escape.  So, you see,\nwe have come in the nick of time.  I fancy that this chief is the fellow\nwhom you heard of, Ralph, at the Island of Emo.  Besides all this, the\nheathen savages are at war among themselves, and there's to be a battle\nfought the day after to-morrow, in which the principal leader is Tararo;\nso that we'll not be able to commence our negotiations with the rascally\nchief till the day after.\"\n\nThe village off which we anchored was beautifully situated at the head of\na small bay, from the margin of which trees of every description peculiar\nto the tropics rose in the richest luxuriance to the summit of a hilly\nridge, which was the line of demarcation between the possessions of the\nChristians and those of the neighbouring heathen chief.\n\nThe site of the settlement was an extensive plot of flat land, stretching\nin a gentle slope from the sea to the mountain.  The cottages stood\nseveral hundred yards from the beach, and were protected from the glare\nof the sea by the rich foliage of rows of large Barringtonia and other\ntrees, which girt the shore.  The village was about a mile in length, and\nperfectly straight, with a wide road down the middle, on either side of\nwhich were rows of the tufted-topped ti tree, whose delicate and\nbeautiful blossoms, hanging beneath their plume-crested tops, added\nrichness to the scene.  The cottages of the natives were built beneath\nthese trees, and were kept in the most excellent order, each having a\nlittle garden in front, tastefully laid out and planted, while the walks\nwere covered with black and white pebbles.\n\nEvery house had doors and Venetian windows, painted partly with lamp\nblack made from the candle-nut, and partly with red ochre, which\ncontrasted powerfully with the dazzling coral lime that covered the\nwalls.  On a prominent position stood a handsome church, which was quite\na curiosity in its way.  It was a hundred feet long by fifty broad, and\nwas seated throughout to accommodate upwards of two thousand persons.  It\nhad six large folding doors and twelve windows with Venetian blinds; and,\nalthough a large and substantial edifice, it had been built, we were told\nby the teacher, in the space of two months!  There was not a single iron\nnail in the fabric, and the natives had constructed it chiefly with their\nstone and bone axes and other tools, having only one or two axes or tools\nof European manufacture.  Everything around this beautiful spot wore an\naspect of peace and plenty, and, as we dropped our anchor within a\nstone's cast of the substantial coral wharf, I could not avoid\ncontrasting it with the wretched village of Emo, where I had witnessed so\nmany frightful scenes.  When the teacher afterwards told me that the\npeople of this tribe had become converts only a year previous to our\narrival, and that they had been living before that in the practice of the\nmost bloody system of idolatry, I could not refrain from exclaiming,\n\"What a convincing proof that Christianity is of God!\"\n\nOn landing from our little boat, we were received with a warm welcome by\nthe teacher and his wife; the latter being also a native, clothed in a\nsimple European gown and straw bonnet.  The shore was lined with hundreds\nof natives, whose persons were all more or less clothed with native\ncloth.  Some of the men had on a kind of poncho formed of this cloth,\ntheir legs being uncovered.  Others wore clumsily-fashioned trousers, and\nno upper garment except hats made of straw and cloth.  Many of the\ndresses, both of women and men, were grotesque enough, being very bad\nimitations of the European garb; but all wore a dress of some sort or\nother.  They seemed very glad to see us, and crowded round us as the\nteacher led the way to his dwelling, where we were entertained, in the\nmost sumptuous manner, on baked pig and all the varieties of fruits and\nvegetables that the island produced.  We were much annoyed, however, by\nthe rats: they seemed to run about the house like domestic animals.  As\nwe sat at table, one of them peeped up at us over the edge of the cloth,\nclose to Peterkin's elbow, who floored it with a blow on the snout from\nhis knife, exclaiming as he did so--\n\n\"I say, Mister Teacher, why don't you set traps for these brutes?--surely\nyou are not fond of them!\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the teacher, with a smile; \"we would be glad to get rid of\nthem if we could; but if we were to trap all the rats on the island, it\nwould occupy our whole time.\"\n\n\"Are they, then, so numerous?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"They swarm everywhere.  The poor heathens on the north side eat them,\nand think them very sweet.  So did my people formerly; but they do not\neat so many now, because the missionary who was last here expressed\ndisgust at it.  The poor people asked if it was wrong to eat rats; and he\ntold them that it was certainly not wrong, but that the people of England\nwould be much disgusted were they asked to eat rats.\"\n\nWe had not been an hour in the house of this kind-hearted man when we\nwere convinced of the truth of his statement as to their numbers, for the\nrats ran about the floors in dozens, and, during our meal, two men were\nstationed at the table to keep them off!\n\n\"What a pity you have no cats,\" said Peterkin, as he aimed a blow at\nanother reckless intruder, and missed it.\n\n\"We would, indeed, be glad to have a few,\" rejoined the teacher, \"but\nthey are difficult to be got.  The hogs, we find, are very good\nrat-killers, but they do not seem to be able to keep the numbers down.  I\nhave heard that they are better than cats.\"\n\nAs the teacher said this, his good-natured black face was wrinkled with a\nsmile of merriment.  Observing that I had noticed it, he said:--\n\n\"I smiled just now when I remembered the fate of the first cat that was\ntaken to Raratonga.  This is one of the stations of the London Missionary\nSociety.  It, like our own, is infested with rats, and a cat was brought\nat last to the island.  It was a large black one.  On being turned loose,\ninstead of being content to stay among men, the cat took to the\nmountains, and lived in a wild state, sometimes paying visits during the\nnight to the houses of the natives; some of whom, living at a distance\nfrom the settlement, had not heard of the cat's arrival, and were\ndreadfully frightened in consequence, calling it a 'monster of the deep,'\nand flying in terror away from it.  One night the cat, feeling a desire\nfor company, I suppose, took its way to the house of a chief, who had\nrecently been converted to Christianity, and had begun to learn to read\nand pray.  The chief's wife, who was sitting awake at his side while he\nslept, beheld with horror two fires glistening in the doorway, and heard\nwith surprise a mysterious voice.  Almost petrified with fear, she awoke\nher husband, and began to upbraid him for forsaking his old religion, and\nburning his god, who, she declared, was now come to be avenged of them.\n'Get up and pray! get up and pray!' she cried.  The chief arose, and, on\nopening his eyes, beheld the same glaring lights, and heard the same\nominous sound.  Impelled by the extreme urgency of the case, he\ncommenced, with all possible vehemence, to vociferate the alphabet, as a\nprayer to God to deliver them from the vengeance of Satan!  On hearing\nthis, the cat, as much alarmed as themselves, fled precipitately away,\nleaving the chief and his wife congratulating themselves on the efficacy\nof their prayer.\"\n\nWe were much diverted with this anecdote, which the teacher related in\nEnglish so good, that we certainly could not have supposed him a native\nbut for the colour of his face and the foreign accent in his tone.  Next\nday we walked out with this interesting man, and were much entertained\nand instructed by his conversation, as we rambled through the cool shady\ngroves of bananas, citrons, limes, and other trees, or sauntered among\nthe cottages of the natives, and watched them while they laboured\ndiligently in the taro beds, or manufactured the tapa or native cloth.  To\nsome of these Jack put questions through the medium of the missionary;\nand the replies were such as to surprise us at the extent of their\nknowledge.  Indeed, Peterkin very truly remarked that \"they seemed to\nknow a considerable deal more than Jack himself!\"\n\nAmong other pieces of interesting information that we obtained was the\nfollowing, in regard to coral formations:--\n\n\"The islands of the Pacific,\" said our friend, \"are of three different\nkinds or classes.  Those of the first class are volcanic, mountainous,\nand wild; some shooting their jagged peaks into the clouds at an\nelevation of ten and fifteen thousand feet.  Those of the second class\nare of crystalized limestone, and vary in height from one hundred to five\nhundred feet.  The hills on these are not so wild or broken as those of\nthe first class, but are richly clothed with vegetation, and very\nbeautiful.  I have no doubt that the Coral Island on which you were\nwrecked was one of this class.  They are supposed to have been upheaved\nfrom the bottom of the sea by volcanic agency, but they are not\nthemselves volcanic in their nature, neither are they of coral formation.\nThose of the third class are the low coralline islands usually having\nlagoons of water in their midst; they are very numerous.\n\n\"As to the manner in which coral islands and reefs are formed; there are\nvarious opinions on this point.  I will give you what seems to me the\nmost probable theory,--a theory, I may add, which is held by some of the\ngood and scientific missionaries.  It is well known that there is much\nlime in salt water; it is also known that coral is composed of lime.  It\nis supposed that the polypes, or coral insects, have the power of\nattracting this lime to their bodies; and with this material they build\ntheir little cells or habitations.  They choose the summit of a volcano,\nor the top of a submarine mountain, as a foundation on which to build;\nfor it is found that they never work at any great depth below the\nsurface.  On this they work; the polypes on the mountain top, of course,\nreach the surface first, then those at the outer edges reach the top\nsooner than the others between them and the centre, thus forming the\ncoral reef surrounding the lagoon of water and the central island; after\nthat the insects within the lagoon cease working.  When the surface of\nthe water is reached, these myriads of wonderful creatures die.  Then\nbirds visit the spot, and seeds are thus conveyed thither, which take\nroot, and spring up, and flourish.  Thus are commenced those coralline\nislets of which you have seen so many in these seas.  The reefs round the\nlarge islands are formed in a similar manner.  When we consider,\" added\nthe missionary, \"the smallness of the architects used by our heavenly\nFather in order to form those lovely and innumerable islands, we are\nfilled with much of that feeling which induced the ancient king to\nexclaim, 'How manifold, O God, are thy works! in wisdom thou hast made\nthem all.'\"\n\nWe all heartily agreed with the missionary in this sentiment, and felt\nnot a little gratified to find that the opinions which Jack and I had\nbeen led to form from personal observation on our Coral Island were thus\nto a great extent corroborated.\n\nThe missionary also gave us an account of the manner in which\nChristianity had been introduced among them.  He said: \"When missionaries\nwere first sent here, three years ago, a small vessel brought them; and\nthe chief, who is now dead, promised to treat well the two native\nteachers who were left with their wives on the island.  But scarcely had\nthe boat which landed them returned to the ship, than the natives began\nto maltreat their guests, taking away all they possessed, and offering\nthem further violence, so that, when the boat was sent in haste to fetch\nthem away, the clothes of both men and women were torn nearly off their\nbacks.\n\n\"Two years after this the vessel visited them again, and I, being in her,\nvolunteered to land alone, without any goods whatever; begging that my\nwife might be brought to me the following year,--that is, _this_ year;\nand, as you see, she is with me.  But the surf was so high that the boat\ncould not land me; so with nothing on but my trousers and shirt, and with\na few catechisms and a Bible, besides some portions of the Scripture\ntranslated into the Mango tongue, I sprang into the sea, and swam ashore\non the crest of a breaker.  I was instantly dragged up the beach by the\nnatives; who, on finding I had nothing worth having upon me, let me\nalone.  I then made signs to my friends in the ship to leave me; which\nthey did.  At fist the natives listened to me in silence, but laughed at\nwhat I said while I preached the gospel of our blessed Saviour Jesus\nChrist to them.  Afterwards they treated me ill sometimes; but I\npersevered, and continued to dwell among them, and dispute, and exhort\nthem to give up their sinful ways of life, burn their idols, and come to\nJesus.\n\n\"About a month after I landed, I heard that the chief was dead.  He was\nthe father of the present chief, who is now a most consistent member of\nthe church.  It is a custom here that, when a chief dies, his wives are\nstrangled and buried with him.  Knowing this, I hastened to his house to\nendeavour to prevent such cruelty if possible.  When I arrived, I found\ntwo of the wives had already been killed, while another was in the act of\nbeing strangled.  I pleaded hard for her, but it was too late; she was\nalready dead.  I then entreated the son to spare the fourth wife; and,\nafter much hesitation, my prayer was granted: but, in half an hour\nafterwards, this poor woman repented of being unfaithful, as she termed\nit, to her husband, and insisted on being strangled; which was\naccordingly done.\n\n\"All this time the chief's son was walking up and down before his\nfather's house with a brow black as thunder.  When he entered, I went in\nwith him, and found, to my surprise, that his father was not dead!  The\nold man was sitting on a mat in a corner, with an expression of placid\nresignation on his face.\n\n\"'Why,' said I, 'have you strangled your father's wives before he is\ndead?'\n\n\"To this the son replied, 'He is dead.  That is no longer my father.  He\nis as good as dead now.  He is to be _buried alive_.'\n\n\"I now remembered having heard that it is a custom among the Feejee\nislanders, that when the reigning chief grows old or infirm, the heir to\nthe chieftainship has a right to depose his father; in which case he is\nconsidered as dead, and is buried alive.  The young chief was now about\nto follow this custom, and, despite my earnest entreaties and pleadings,\nthe old chief was buried that day before my eyes in the same grave with\nhis four strangled wives!  Oh! my heart groaned when I saw this, and I\nprayed to God to open the hearts of these poor creatures, as he had\nalready opened mine, and pour into them the light and the love of the\ngospel of Jesus.  My prayer was answered very soon.  A week afterwards,\nthe son, who was now chief of the tribe, came to me, bearing his god on\nhis shoulders, and groaning beneath its weight.  Flinging it down at my\nfeet, he desired me to burn it!\n\n\"You may conceive how overjoyed I was at this.  I sprang up and embraced\nhim, while I shed tears of joy.  Then we made a fire, and burned the god\nto ashes, amid an immense concourse of the people, who seemed terrified\nat what was being done, and shrank back when we burned the god, expecting\nsome signal vengeance to be taken upon us; but seeing that nothing\nhappened, they changed their minds, and thought that our God must be the\ntrue one after all.  From that time the mission prospered steadily, and\nnow, while there is not a single man in the tribe who has not burned his\nhousehold gods, and become a convert to Christianity, there are not a\nfew, I hope, who are true followers of the Lamb, having been plucked as\nbrands from the burning by Him who can save unto the uttermost.  I will\nnot tell you more of our progress at this time, but you see,\" he said,\nwaving his hand around him, \"the village and the church did not exist a\nyear ago!\"\n\nWe were indeed much interested in this account, and I could not help\nagain in my heart praying God to prosper those missionary societies that\nsend such inestimable blessings to these islands of dark and bloody\nidolatry.  The teacher also added that the other tribes were very\nindignant at this one for having burned its gods, and threatened to\ndestroy it altogether, but they had done nothing yet; \"and if they\nshould,\" said the teacher, \"the Lord is on our side; of whom shall we be\nafraid?\"\n\n\"Have the missionaries many stations in these seas?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  The London Missionary Society have a great many in the Tahiti\ngroup, and other islands in that quarter.  Then the Wesleyans have the\nFeejee Islands all to themselves, and the Americans have many stations in\nother groups.  But still, my friend, there are hundreds of islands here\nthe natives of which have never heard of Jesus, or the good word of God,\nor the Holy Spirit; and thousands are living and dying in the practice of\nthose terrible sins and bloody murders of which you have already heard.  I\ntrust, my friends,\" he added, looking earnestly into our faces, \"I trust\nthat if you ever return to England, you will tell your Christian friends\nthat the horrors which they hear of in regard to these islands are\n_literally true_, and that when they have heard the worst, the '_half has\nnot been told them_;' for there are perpetrated here foul deeds of\ndarkness of which man may not speak.  You may also tell them,\" he said,\nlooking around with a smile, while a tear of gratitude trembled in his\neye and rolled down his coal-black cheek,--\"tell them of the blessings\nthat the gospel has wrought _here_!\"\n\nWe assured our friend that we would certainly not forget his request.  On\nreturning towards the village, about noon, we remarked on the beautiful\nwhiteness of the cottages.\n\n\"That is owing to the lime with which they are plastered,\" said the\nteacher.  \"When the natives were converted, as I have described, I set\nthem to work to build cottages for themselves, and also this handsome\nchurch which you see.  When the framework and other parts of the houses\nwere up, I sent the people to fetch coral from the sea.  They brought\nimmense quantities.  Then I made them cut wood, and, piling the coral\nabove it, set it on fire.\n\n\"'Look! look!' cried the poor people, in amazement; 'what wonderful\npeople the Christians are!  He is roasting stones.  We shall not need\ntaro or bread-fruit any more; we may eat stones!'\n\n\"But their surprise was still greater when the coral was reduced to a\nfine soft white powder.  They immediately set up a great shout, and,\nmingling the lime with water, rubbed their faces and their bodies all\nover with it, and ran through the village screaming with delight.  They\nwere also much surprised at another thing they saw me do.  I wished to\nmake some household furniture, and constructed a turning-lathe to assist\nme.  The first thing that I turned was the leg of a sofa; which was no\nsooner finished than the chief seized it with wonder and delight, and ran\nthrough the village exhibiting it to the people, who looked upon it with\ngreat admiration.  The chief then, tying a string to it, hung it round\nhis neck as an ornament!  He afterwards told me that if he had seen it\nbefore he became a Christian he would have made it his god!\"\n\nAs the teacher concluded this anecdote we reached his door.  Saying that\nhe had business to attend to, he left us to amuse ourselves as we best\ncould.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, turning abruptly towards us, and buttoning up his\njacket as he spoke, \"I'm off to see the battle.  I've no particular\nfondness for seein' blood-shed, but I must find out the nature o' these\nfellows and see their customs with my own eyes, so that I may be able to\nspeak of it again, if need be, authoritatively.  It's only six miles off,\nand we don't run much more risk than that of getting a rap with a stray\nstone or an over-shot arrow.  Will you go?\"\n\n\"To be sure we will,\" said Peterkin.\n\n\"If they chance to see us we'll cut and run for it,\" added Jack.\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried Peterkin,--\"_you_ run! thought you would scorn to run\nfrom any one.\"\n\n\"So I would, if it were my duty to fight,\" returned Jack, coolly; \"but as\nI don't want to fight, and don't intend to fight, if they offer to attack\nus I'll run away like the veriest coward that ever went by the name of\nPeterkin.  So come along.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\nA strange and bloody battle--The lion bearded in his den--Frightful\nscenes of cruelty, and fears for the future.\n\nWe had ascertained from the teacher the direction to the spot on which\nthe battle was to be fought, and after a walk of two hours reached it.\nThe summit of a bare hill was the place chosen; for, unlike most of the\nother islanders, who are addicted to bush-fighting, those of Mango are in\nthe habit of meeting on open ground.  We arrived before the two parties\nhad commenced the deadly struggle, and, creeping as close up as we dared\namong the rocks, we lay and watched them.\n\nThe combatants were drawn up face to face, each side ranged in rank four\ndeep.  Those in the first row were armed with long spears; the second,\nwith clubs to defend the spearmen; the third row was composed of young\nmen with slings; and the fourth consisted of women, who carried baskets\nof stones for the slingers, and clubs and spears with which to supply the\nwarriors.  Soon after we arrived, the attack was made with great fury.\nThere was no science displayed.  The two bodies of savages rushed\nheadlong upon each other and engaged in a general _melee_, and a more\ndreadful set of men I have never seen.  They wore grotesque war-caps made\nof various substances and decorated with feathers.  Their faces and\nbodies were painted so as to make them look as frightful as possible; and\nas they brandished their massive clubs, leaped, shouted, yelled, and\ndashed each other to the ground, I thought I had never seen men look so\nlike demons before.\n\nWe were much surprised at the conduct of the women, who seemed to be\nperfect furies, and hung about the heels of their husbands in order to\ndefend them.  One stout young women we saw, whose husband was hard\npressed and about to be overcome: she lifted a large stone, and throwing\nit at his opponent's head, felled him to the earth.  But the battle did\nnot last long.  The band most distant from us gave way and were routed,\nleaving eighteen of their comrades dead upon the field.  These the\nvictors brained as they lay; and putting some of their brains on leaves\nwent off with them, we were afterwards informed, to their temples, to\npresent them to their gods as an earnest of the human victims who were\nsoon to be brought there.\n\nWe hastened back to the Christian village with feelings of the deepest\nsadness at the sanguinary conflict which we had just witnessed.\n\nNext day, after breakfasting with our friend the teacher, we made\npreparations for carrying out our plan.  At first the teacher endeavoured\nto dissuade us.\n\n\"You do not know,\" said he, turning to Jack, \"the danger you run in\nventuring amongst these ferocious savages.  I feel much pity for poor\nAvatea; but you are not likely to succeed in saving her, and you may die\nin the attempt.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jack, quietly, \"I am not afraid to die in a good cause.\"\n\nThe teacher smiled approvingly at him as he said this, and after a little\nfurther conversation agreed to accompany us as interpreter; saying that,\nalthough Tararo was unfriendly to him, he had hitherto treated him with\nrespect.\n\nWe now went on board the schooner, having resolved to sail round the\nisland and drop anchor opposite the heathen village.  We manned her with\nnatives, and hoped to overawe the savages by displaying our brass gun to\nadvantage.  The teacher soon after came on board, and setting our sails\nwe put to sea.  In two hours more we made the cliffs reverberate with the\ncrash of the big gun, which we fired by way of salute, while we ran the\nBritish ensign up to the peak and cast anchor.  The commotion on shore\nshowed us that we had struck terror into the hearts of the natives; but\nseeing that we did not offer to molest them, a canoe at length put off\nand paddled cautiously towards us.  The teacher showed himself, and\nexplaining that we were friends and wished to palaver with the chief,\ndesired the native to go and tell him to come on board.\n\nWe waited long and with much impatience for an answer.  During this time\nthe native teacher conversed with us again, and told us many things\nconcerning the success of the gospel among those islands; and perceiving\nthat we were by no means so much gratified as we ought to have been at\nthe hearing of such good news, he pressed us more closely in regard to\nour personal interest in religion, and exhorted us to consider that our\nsouls were certainly in as great danger as those of the wretched heathen\nwhom we pitied so much, if we had not already found salvation in Jesus\nChrist.  \"Nay, further,\" he added, \"if such be your unhappy case, you\nare, in the sight of God, much worse than these savages (forgive me, my\nyoung friends, for saying so); for they have no knowledge, no light, and\ndo not profess to believe; while you, on the contrary, have been brought\nup in the light of the blessed gospel and call yourselves Christians.\nThese poor savages are indeed the enemies of our Lord; but you, if ye be\nnot true believers, are traitors!\"\n\nI must confess that my heart condemned me while the teacher spoke in this\nearnest manner, and I knew not what to reply.  Peterkin, too, did not\nseem to like it, and I thought would willingly have escaped; but Jack\nseemed deeply impressed, and wore an anxious expression on his naturally\ngrave countenance, while he assented to the teacher's remarks and put to\nhim many earnest questions.  Meanwhile the natives who composed our crew,\nhaving nothing particular to do, had squatted down on the deck and taken\nout their little books containing the translated portions of the New\nTestament, along with hymns and spelling-books, and were now busily\nengaged, some vociferating the alphabet, others learning prayers off by\nheart, while a few sang hymns,--all of them being utterly unmindful of\nour presence.  The teacher soon joined them, and soon afterwards they all\nengaged in a prayer which was afterwards translated to us, and proved to\nbe a petition for the success of our undertaking and for the conversion\nof the heathen.\n\nWhile we were thus engaged a canoe put off from shore and several savages\nleaped on deck, one of whom advanced to the teacher and informed him that\nTararo could not come on board that day, being busy with some religious\nceremonies before the gods, which could on no account be postponed.  He\nwas also engaged with a friendly chief who was about to take his\ndeparture from the island, and therefore begged that the teacher and his\nfriends would land and pay a visit to him.  To this the teacher returned\nanswer that we would land immediately.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, as we were about to step into our little boat,\n\"I'm not going to take any weapons with me, and I recommend you to take\nnone either.  We are altogether in the power of these savages, and the\nutmost we could do, if they were to attack us, would be to kill a few of\nthem before we were ourselves overpowered.  I think that our only chance\nof success lies in mild measures.  Don't you think so?\"\n\nTo this I assented gladly, and Peterkin replied by laying down a huge\nbell-mouthed blunderbuss, and divesting himself of a pair of enormous\nhorse-pistols with which he had purposed to overawe the natives!  We then\njumped into our boat and rowed ashore.\n\nOn reaching the beach we were received by a crowd of naked savages, who\nshouted a rude welcome, and conducted us to a house or shed where a baked\npig and a variety of vegetables were prepared for us.  Having partaken of\nthese, the teacher begged to be conducted to the chief; but there seemed\nsome hesitation, and after some consultation among themselves, one of the\nmen stood forward and spoke to the teacher.\n\n\"What says he?\" inquired Jack when the savage had concluded.\n\n\"He says that the chief is just going to the temple of his god and cannot\nsee us yet; so we must be patient, my friend.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried Jack, rising; \"if he won't come to see me, I'll e'en go and\nsee him.  Besides, I have a great desire to witness their proceedings at\nthis temple of theirs.  Will you go with me, friend?\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" said the teacher, shaking his head; \"I must not go to the\nheathen temples and witness their inhuman rites, except for the purpose\nof condemning their wickedness and folly.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" returned Jack; \"then I'll go alone, for I cannot condemn\ntheir doings till I have seen them.\"\n\nJack arose, and we, having determined to go also, followed him through\nthe banana groves to a rising ground immediately behind the village, on\nthe top of which stood the Bure, or temple, under the dark shade of a\ngroup of iron-wood trees.  As we went through the village, I was again\nled to contrast the rude huts and sheds, and their almost naked savage-\nlooking inhabitants, with the natives of the Christian village, who, to\nuse the teacher's scriptural expression, were now \"clothed and in their\nright mind.\"\n\nAs we turned into a broad path leading towards the hill, we were arrested\nby the shouts of an approaching multitude in the rear.  Drawing aside\ninto the bushes we awaited their coming up, and as they drew near we\nobserved that it was a procession of the natives, many of whom were\ndancing and gesticulating in the most frantic manner.  They had an\nexceedingly hideous aspect, owing to the black, red, and yellow paints\nwith which their faces and naked bodies were bedaubed.  In the midst of\nthese came a band of men carrying three or four planks, on which were\nseated in rows upwards of a dozen men.  I shuddered involuntarily as I\nrecollected the sacrifice of human victims at the island of Emo, and\nturned with a look of fear to Jack as I said,--\n\n\"Oh, Jack!  I have a terrible dread that they are going to commit some of\ntheir cruel practices on these wretched men.  We had better not go to the\ntemple.  We shall only be horrified without being able to do any good,\nfor I fear they are going to kill them.\"\n\nJack's face wore an expression of deep compassion as he said, in a low\nvoice, \"No fear, Ralph; the sufferings of these poor fellows are over\nlong ago.\"\n\nI turned with a start as he spoke, and, glancing at the men, who were now\nquite near to the spot where we stood, saw that they were all dead.  They\nwere tied firmly with ropes in a sitting posture on the planks, and\nseemed, as they bent their sightless eye-balls and grinning mouths over\nthe dancing crew below, as if they were laughing in ghastly mockery at\nthe utter inability of their enemies to hurt them now.  These, we\ndiscovered afterwards, were the men who had been slain in the battle of\nthe previous day, and were now on their way to be first presented to the\ngods, and then eaten.  Behind these came two men leading between them a\nthird, whose hands were pinioned behind his back.  He walked with a firm\nstep, and wore a look of utter indifference on his face, as they led him\nalong; so that we concluded he must be a criminal who was about to\nreceive some slight punishment for his faults.  The rear of the\nprocession was brought up by a shouting crowd of women and children, with\nwhom we mingled and followed to the temple.\n\nHere we arrived in a few minutes.  The temple was a tall circular\nbuilding, open at one side.  Around it were strewn heaps of human bones\nand skulls.  At a table inside sat the priest, an elderly man, with a\nlong gray beard.  He was seated on a stool, and before him lay several\nknives, made of wood, bone, and splinters of bamboo, with which he\nperformed his office of dissecting dead bodies.  Farther in lay a variety\nof articles that had been dedicated to the god, and among them were many\nspears and clubs.  I observed among the latter some with human teeth\nsticking in them, where the victims had been clubbed in their mouths.\n\nBefore this temple the bodies, which were painted with vermilion and\nsoot, were arranged in a sitting posture; and a man, called a \"dan-vosa\"\n(orator), advanced, and, laying his hands on their heads, began to chide\nthem, apparently, in a low bantering tone.  What he said we knew not,\nbut, as he went on, he waxed warm, and at last shouted to them at the top\nof his lungs, and finally finished by kicking the bodies over and running\naway, amid the shouts and laughter of the people, who now rushed forward.\nSeizing the bodies by a leg, or an arm, or by the hair of the head, they\ndragged them over stumps and stones and through sloughs, until they were\nexhausted.  The bodies were then brought back to the temple and dissected\nby the priest, after which they were taken out to be baked.\n\nClose to the temple a large fire was kindled, in which stones were heated\nred hot.  When ready these were spread out on the ground, and a thick\ncoating of leaves strewn over them to slack the heat.  On this \"lovo,\" or\noven, the bodies were then placed, covered over, and left to bake.\n\nThe crowd now ran, with terrible yells, towards a neighbouring hill or\nmound, on which we observed the frame-work of a house lying ready to be\nerected.  Sick with horror, yet fascinated by curiosity, we staggered\nafter them mechanically, scarce knowing where we were going or what we\ndid, and feeling a sort of impression that all we saw was a dreadful\ndream.\n\nArrived at the place, we saw the multitude crowding round a certain spot.\nWe pressed forward and obtained a sight of what they were doing.  A large\nwooden beam or post lay on the ground, beside the other parts of the\nframe-work of the house, and close to the end of it was a hole about\nseven feet deep and upwards of two feet wide.  While we looked, the man\nwhom we had before observed with his hands pinioned, was carried into the\ncircle.  His hands were now free, but his legs were tightly strapped\ntogether.  The post of the house was then placed in the hole, and the man\nput in beside it.  His head was a good way below the surface of the hole,\nand his arms were clasped round the post.  Earth was now thrown in until\nall was covered over and stamped down; and this, we were afterwards told,\nwas a _ceremony_ usually performed at the dedication of a new temple, or\nthe erection of a chief's house!\n\n\"Come, come,\" cried Jack, on beholding this horrible tragedy, \"we have\nseen enough, enough, far more than enough!  Let us go.\"\n\nJack's face looked ghastly pale and haggard as we hurried back to rejoin\nthe teacher, and I have no doubt that he felt terrible anxiety when he\nconsidered the number and ferocity of the savages, and the weakness of\nthe few arms which were ready indeed to essay, but impotent to effect,\nAvatea's deliverance from these ruthless men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\nAn unexpected discovery, and a bold, reckless defiance, with its\nconsequences--Plans of escape, and heroic resolves.\n\nWhen we returned to the shore, and related to our friend what had passed,\nhe was greatly distressed, and groaned in spirit; but we had not sat long\nin conversation, when we were interrupted by the arrival of Tararo on the\nbeach, accompanied by a number of followers bearing baskets of vegetables\nand fruits on their heads.\n\nWe advanced to meet him, and he expressed, through our interpreter, much\npleasure in seeing us.\n\n\"And what is it that my friends wish to say to me?\" he inquired.\n\nThe teacher explained that we came to beg that Avatea might be spared.\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Jack, \"that I consider that I have a right to ask this\nof him, having not only saved the girl's life, but the lives of his own\npeople also; and say that I wish her to be allowed to follow her own\nwishes, and join the Christians.\"\n\nWhile this was being translated, the chiefs brow lowered, and we could\nsee plainly that our request met with no favourable reception.  He\nreplied with considerable energy, and at some length.\n\n\"What says he?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"I regret to say that he will not listen to the proposal.  He says he has\npledged his word to his friend that the girl shall be sent to him, and a\ndeputy is even now on this island awaiting the fulfilment of the pledge.\"\n\nJack bit his lip in suppressed anger.  \"Tell Tararo,\" he exclaimed with\nflashing eye, \"that if he does not grant my demand, it will be worse for\nhim.  Say I have a big gun on board my schooner that will blow his\nvillage into the sea, if he does not give up the girl.\"\n\n\"Nay, my friend,\" said the teacher, gently, \"I will not tell him that; we\nmust overcome evil with good.'\"\n\n\"What does my friend say?\" inquired the chief, who seemed nettled by\nJack's looks of defiance.\n\n\"He is displeased,\" replied the teacher.\n\nTararo turned away with a smile of contempt, and walked towards the men\nwho carried the baskets of vegetables, and who had now emptied the whole\non the beach in an enormous pile.\n\n\"What are they doing there?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I think that they are laying out a gift which they intend to present to\nsome one,\" said the teacher.\n\nAt this moment a couple of men appeared leading a young girl between\nthem; and, going towards the heap of fruits and vegetables, placed her on\nthe top of it.  We started with surprise and fear, for in the young\nfemale before us we recognised the Samoan girl, Avatea!\n\nWe stood rooted to the earth with surprise and thick coming fears.\n\n\"Oh! my dear young friend,\" whispered the teacher, in a voice of deep\nemotion, while he seized Jack by the arm, \"she is to be made a sacrifice\neven now!\"\n\n\"Is she?\" cried Jack, with a vehement shout, spurning the teacher aside,\nand dashing over two natives who stood in his way, while he rushed\ntowards the heap, sprang up its side, and seized Avatea by the arm.  In\nanother moment he dragged her down, placed her back to a large tree, and,\nwrenching a war-club from the hand of a native who seemed powerless and\npetrified with surprise, whirled it above his head, and yelled, rather\nthan shouted, while his face blazed with fury, \"Come on, the whole nation\nof you, an ye like it, and do your worst!\"\n\nIt seemed as though the challenge had been literally accepted; for every\nsavage on the ground ran precipitately at Jack with club and spear, and,\ndoubtless, would speedily have poured out his brave blood on the sod, had\nnot the teacher rushed in between them, and, raising his voice to its\nutmost, cried.--\n\n\"Stay your hands, warriors!  It is not your part to judge in this matter.\nIt is for Tararo, the chief, to say whether or not the young man shall\nlive or die.\"\n\nThe natives were arrested; and I know not whether it was the gratifying\nacknowledgment of his superiority thus made by the teacher, or some\nlingering feeling of gratitude for Jack's former aid in time of need,\nthat influenced Tararo, but he stepped forward, and, waving his hand,\nsaid to his people,--\"Desist.  The young man's life is mine.\"  Then,\nturning to Jack, he said, \"You have forfeited your liberty and life to\nme.  Submit yourself, for we are more numerous than the sand upon the\nshore.  You are but one; why should you die?\"\n\n\"Villain!\" exclaimed Jack, passionately, \"I may die, but, assuredly, I\nshall not perish alone.  I will not submit until you promise that this\ngirl shall not be injured.\"\n\n\"You are very bold,\" replied the chief, haughtily, \"but very foolish.  Yet\nI will say that Avatea shall not be sent away, at least for three days.\"\n\n\"You had better accept these terms,\" whispered the teacher, entreatingly.\n\"If you persist in this mad defiance, you will be slain, and Avatea will\nbe lost.  Three days are worth having.\"\n\nJack hesitated a moment, then lowered his club, and, throwing it moodily\nto the ground, crossed his arms on his breast, and hung down his head in\nsilence.\n\nTararo seemed pleased by his submission, and told the teacher to say that\nhe did not forget his former services, and, therefore, would leave him\nfree as to his person, but that the schooner would be detained till he\nhad further considered the matter.\n\nWhile the teacher translated this, he approached as near to where Avatea\nwas standing as possible, without creating suspicion, and whispered to\nher a few words in the native language.  Avatea, who, during the whole of\nthe foregoing scene, had stood leaning against the tree perfectly\npassive, and seemingly quite uninterested in all that was going on,\nreplied by a single rapid glance of her dark eye, which was instantly\ncast down again on the ground at her feet.\n\nTararo now advanced, and taking the girl by the hand, led her\nunresistingly away, while Jack, Peterkin, and I returned with the teacher\non board the schooner.\n\nOn reaching the deck, we went down to the cabin, where Jack threw\nhimself, in a state of great dejection, on a couch; but the teacher\nseated himself by his side, and, laying his hand upon his shoulder,\nsaid,--\n\n\"Do not give way to anger, my young friend.  God has given us three days,\nand we must use the means that are in our power to free this poor girl\nfrom slavery.  We must not sit in idle disappointment, we must act\"--\n\n\"Act!\" cried Jack, raising himself, and tossing back his hair wildly; \"it\nis mockery to balk of acting when one is bound hand and foot.  How can I\nact?  I cannot fight a whole nation of savages single-handed.  Yes,\" he\nsaid, with a bitter smile, \"I can fight them, but I cannot conquer them,\nor save Avatea.\"\n\n\"Patience, my friend; your spirit is not a good one just now.  You cannot\nexpect that blessing which alone can insure success, unless you are more\nsubmissive.  I will tell you my plans if you will listen.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" cried Jack, eagerly, \"of course I will, my good fellow; I did\nnot know you had any plans.  Out with them.  I only hope you will show me\nhow I can get the girl on board of this schooner, and I'd up anchor and\naway in no time.  But proceed with your plans.\"\n\nThe teacher smiled sadly: \"Ah! my friend, if one fathom of your anchor\nchain were to rattle, as you drew it in, a thousand warriors would be\nstanding on your deck.  No, no, that could not be done.  Even now, your\nship would be taken from you were it not that Tararo has some feeling of\ngratitude toward you.  But I know Tararo well.  He is a man of falsehood,\nas all the unconverted savages are.  The chief to whom he has promised\nthis girl is very powerful, and Tararo _must_ fulfil his promise.  He has\ntold you that he would do nothing to the girl for three days; but that is\nbecause the party who are to take her away will not be ready to start for\nthree days.  Still, as he might have made you a prisoner during those\nthree days, I say that God has given them to us.\"\n\n\"Well, but what do you propose to do?\" said Jack, impatiently.\n\n\"My plan involves much danger, but I see no other, and I think you have\ncourage to brave it.  It is this: There is an island about fifty miles to\nthe south of this, the natives of which are Christians, and have been so\nfor two years or more, and the principal chief is Avatea's lover.  Once\nthere, Avatea would be safe.  Now, I suggest that you should abandon your\nschooner.  Do you think that you can make so great a sacrifice?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" replied Jack, \"when I make up my mind to go through with a\nthing of importance, I can make any sacrifice.\"\n\nThe teacher smiled.  \"Well, then, the savages could not conceive it\npossible that, for the sake of a girl, you would voluntarily lose your\nfine vessel; therefore as long as she lies here they think they have you\nall safe: so I suggest that we get a quantity of stores conveyed to a\nsequestered part of the shore, provide a small canoe, put Avatea on\nboard, and you three would paddle to the Christian island.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Peterkin, springing up and seizing the teacher's hand.\n\"Missionary, you're a regular brick.  I didn't think you had so much in\nyou.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" continued the teacher, \"I will remain on board till they\ndiscover that you are gone.  Then they will ask me where you are gone to,\nand I will refuse to tell.\"\n\n\"And what'll be the result of that?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"I know not.  Perhaps they will kill me; but,\" he added, looking at Jack\nwith a peculiar smile, \"I too am not afraid to die in a good cause!\"\n\n\"But how are we to get hold of Avatea?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"I have arranged with her to meet us at a particular spot, to which I\nwill guide you to-night.  We shall then arrange about it.  She will\neasily manage to elude her keepers, who are not very strict in watching\nher, thinking it impossible that she could escape from the island.\nIndeed, I am sure that such an idea will never enter their heads.  But,\nas I have said, you run great danger.  Fifty miles in a small canoe, on\nthe open sea, is a great voyage to make.  You may miss the island, too,\nin which case there is no other in that direction for a hundred miles or\nmore; and if you lose your way and fall among other heathens, you know\nthe law of Feejee--a cast-away who gains the shore is doomed to die.  You\nmust count the cost, my young friend.\"\n\n\"I have counted it,\" replied Jack.  \"If Avatea consents to run the risk,\nmost certainly I will; and so will my comrades also.  Besides,\" added\nJack, looking seriously into the teacher's face, \"your Bible,--_our_\nBible, tells of ONE who delivers those who call on Him in the time of\ntrouble; who holds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of\nhis hand.\"\n\nWe now set about active preparations for the intended voyage; collected\ntogether such things as we should require, and laid out on the deck\nprovisions sufficient to maintain us for several weeks, purposing to load\nthe canoe with as much as she could hold consistently with speed and\nsafety.  These we covered with a tarpaulin, intending to convey them to\nthe canoe only a few hours before starting.  When night spread her sable\ncurtain over the scene, we prepared to land; but, first, kneeling along\nwith the natives and the teacher, the latter implored a blessing on our\nenterprise.  Then we rowed quietly to the shore and followed our sable\nguide, who led us by a long detour, in order to avoid the village, to the\nplace of rendezvous.  We had not stood more than five minutes under the\ngloomy shade of the thick foliage when a dark figure glided noiselessly\nup to us.\n\n\"Ah! here you are,\" said Jack, as Avatea approached.  \"Now, then, tell\nher what we've come about, and don't waste time.\"\n\n\"I understan' leetl English,\" said Avatea, in a low voice.\n\n\"Why, where did you pick up English?\" exclaimed Jack, in amazement; \"you\nwere dumb as a stone when I saw you last.\"\n\n\"She has learned all she knows of it from me,\" said the teacher, \"since\nshe came to the island.\"\n\nWe now gave Avatea a full explanation of our plans, entering into all the\ndetails, and concealing none of the danger, so that she might be fully\naware of the risk she ran.  As we had anticipated, she was too glad of\nthe opportunity thus afforded her to escape from her persecutors to think\nof the danger or risk.\n\n\"Then you're willing to go with us, are you?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Yis, I am willing to go.\"\n\n\"And you're not afraid to trust yourself out on the deep sea so far?\"\n\n\"No, I not 'fraid to go.  Safe with Christian.\"\n\nAfter some further consultation, the teacher suggested that it was time\nto return, so we bade Avatea good night, and having appointed to meet at\nthe cliff where the canoe lay, on the following night, just after dark,\nwe hastened away--we to row on board the schooner with muffled\noars--Avatea to glide back to her prison-hut among the Mango savages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\nThe flight--The pursuit--Despair and its results--The lion bearded in his\nden again--Awful danger threatened and wonderfully averted--A terrific\nstorm.\n\nAs the time for our meditated flight drew near, we became naturally very\nfearful lest our purpose should be discovered, and we spent the whole of\nthe following day in a state of nervous anxiety.  We resolved to go a-\nshore and ramble about the village, as if to observe the habits and\ndwellings of the people, as we thought that an air of affected\nindifference to the events of the previous day would be more likely than\nany other course of conduct to avert suspicion as to our intentions.\nWhile we were thus occupied, the teacher remained on board with the\nChristian natives, whose powerful voices reached us ever and anon as they\nengaged in singing hymns or in prayer.\n\nAt last the long and tedious day came to a close, the sank into the sea,\nand the short-lived twilight of those regions, to which I have already\nreferred, ended abruptly in a dark night.  Hastily throwing a few\nblankets into our little boat, we stepped into it, and, whispering\nfarewell to the natives in the schooner, rowed gently over the lagoon,\ntaking care to keep as near to the beach as possible.  We rowed in the\nutmost silence and with muffled oars, so that had any one observed us at\nthe distance of a few yards, he might have almost taken us for a phantom-\nboat or a shadow on the dark water.  Not a breath of air was stirring;\nbut fortunately the gentle ripple of the sea upon the shore, mingled with\nthe soft roar of the breaker on the distant reef, effectually drowned the\nslight plash that we unavoidably made in the water by the dipping of our\noars.\n\nQuarter of an hour sufficed to bring us to the over-hanging cliff under\nwhose black shadow our little canoe lay, with her bow in the water ready\nto be launched, and most of her cargo already stowed away.  As the keel\nof our little boat grated on the sand, a hand was laid upon the bow, and\na dim form was seen.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Peterkin in a whisper, as he stepped upon the beach, \"is that\nyou, Avatea?\"\n\n\"Yis, it am me,\" was the reply.\n\n\"All right!  Now, then, gently.  Help me to shove off the canoe,\"\nwhispered Jack to the teacher; \"and Peterkin, do you shove these blankets\naboard, we may want them before long.  Avatea, step into the\nmiddle;--that's right.\"\n\n\"Is all ready?\" whispered the teacher.\n\n\"Not quite,\" replied Peterkin.  \"Here, Ralph, lay hold o' this pair of\noars, and stow them away if you can.  I don't like paddles.  After we're\nsafe away I'll try to rig up rollicks for them.\"\n\n\"Now, then, in with you and shove off.\"\n\nOne more earnest squeeze of the kind teacher's hand, and, with his\nwhispered blessing yet sounding in our ears, we shot like an arrow from\nthe shore, sped over the still waters of the lagoon, and paddled as\nswiftly as strong arms and willing hearts could urge us over the long\nswell of the open sea.\n\nAll that night and the whole of the following day we plied our paddles in\nalmost total silence and without halt, save twice to recruit our failing\nenergies with a mouthful of food and a draught of water.  Jack had taken\nthe bearing of the island just after starting, and laying a small pocket-\ncompass before him, kept the head of the canoe due south, for our chance\nof hitting the island depended very much on the faithfulness of our\nsteersman in keeping our tiny bark exactly and constantly on its proper\ncourse.  Peterkin and I paddled in the bow, and Avatea worked untiringly\nin the middle.\n\nAs the sun's lower limb dipped on the gilded edge of the sea Jack ceased\nworking, threw down his paddle, and called a halt.\n\n\"There,\" he cried, heaving a deep, long-drawn sigh, \"we've put a\nconsiderable breadth of water between us and these black rascals, so now\nwe'll have a hearty supper and a sound sleep.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Nobly spoken, Jack.  Hand me a drop\nwater, Ralph.  Why, girl what's wrong with you?  You look just like a\nblack owl blinking in the sunshine.\"\n\nAvatea smiled.  \"I sleepy,\" she said; and as if to prove the truth of\nthis, she laid her head on the edge of the canoe and fell fast asleep.\n\n\"That's uncommon sharp practice,\" said Peterkin, with a broad grin.\n\"Don't you think we should awake her to make her eat something first? or,\nperhaps,\" he added, with a grave, meditative look, \"perhaps we might put\nsome food in her mouth, which is so elegantly open at the present moment,\nand see if she'd swallow it while asleep.  If so, Ralph, you might come\nround to the front here and feed her quietly, while Jack and I are\ntucking into the victuals.  It would be a monstrous economy of time.\"\n\nI could not help smiling at Peterkin's idea, which, indeed, when I\npondered it, seemed remarkably good in theory; nevertheless I declined to\nput it in practice, being fearful of the result should the victual chance\nto go down the wrong throat.  But, on suggesting this to Peterkin, he\nexclaimed--\n\n\"Down the wrong throat, man! why, a fellow with half an eye might see\nthat if it went down Avatea's throat it could not go down the wrong\nthroat!--unless, indeed, you have all of a sudden become inordinately\nselfish, and think that all the throats in the world are wrong ones\nexcept your own.  However, don't talk so much, and hand me the pork\nbefore Jack finishes it.  I feel myself entitled to at least one minute\nmorsel.\"\n\n\"Peterkin, you're a villain.  A paltry little villain,\" said Jack,\nquietly, as he tossed the hind legs (including the tail) of a cold roast\npig to his comrade; \"and I must again express my regret that unavoidable\ncircumstances have thrust your society upon me, and that necessity has\ncompelled me to cultivate your acquaintance.  Were it not that you are\nincapable of walking upon the water, I would order you, sir, out of the\ncanoe.\"\n\n\"There! you've wakened Avatea with your long tongue,\" retorted Peterkin,\nwith a frown, as the girl gave vent to a deep sigh.  \"No,\" he continued,\n\"it was only a snore.  Perchance she dreameth of her black Apollo.  I\nsay, Ralph, do leave just one little slice of that yam.  Between you and\nJack I run a chance of being put on short allowance, if not--yei--a--a--ow!\"\n\nPeterkin's concluding remark was a yawn of so great energy that Jack\nrecommended him to postpone the conclusion of his meal till next\nmorning,--a piece of advice which he followed so quickly, that I was\nforcibly reminded of his remark, a few minutes before, in regard to the\nsharp practice of Avatea.\n\nMy readers will have observed, probably, by this time, that I am much\ngiven to meditation; they will not, therefore, be surprised to learn that\nI fell into a deep reverie on the subject of sleep, which was continued\nwithout intermission into the night, and prolonged without interruption\ninto the following morning.  But I cannot feel assured that I actually\nslept during that time, although I am tolerably certain that I was not\nawake.\n\nThus we lay like a shadow on the still bosom of the ocean, while the\nnight closed in, and all around was calm, dark, and silent.\n\nA thrilling cry of alarm from Peterkin startled us in the morning, just\nas the gray dawn began to glimmer in the east.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" cried Jack, starting up.\n\nPeterkin replied by pointing with a look of anxious dread towards the\nhorizon; and a glance sufficed to show us that one of the largest sized\nwar-canoes was approaching us!\n\nWith a groan of mingled despair and anger Jack seized his paddle, glanced\nat the compass, and, in a suppressed voice, commanded us to \"give way.\"\n\nBut we did not require to be urged.  Already our four paddles were\nglancing in the water, and the canoe bounded over the glassy sea like a\ndolphin, while a shout from our pursuers told that they had observed our\nmotions.\n\n\"I see something like land ahead,\" said Jack, in a hopeful tone.  \"It\nseems impossible that we could have made the island yet; still, if it is\nso, we may reach it before these fellows can catch us, for our canoe is\nlight and our muscles are fresh.\"\n\nNo one replied; for, to say truth, we felt that, in a long chase, we had\nno chance whatever with a canoe which held nearly a hundred warriors.\nNevertheless, we resolved to do our utmost to escape, and paddled with a\ndegree of vigour that kept us well in advance of our pursuers.  The war-\ncanoe was so far behind us that it seemed but a little speck on the sea,\nand the shouts, to which the crew occasionally gave vent, came faintly\ntowards us on the morning breeze.  We therefore hoped that we should be\nable to keep in advance for an hour or two, when we might, perhaps, reach\nthe land ahead.  But this hope was suddenly crushed by the supposed land,\nnot long after, rising up into the sky; thus proving itself to be a fog-\nbank!\n\nA bitter feeling of disappointment filled each heart, and was expressed\non each countenance, as we beheld this termination to our hopes.  But we\nhad little time to think of regret.  Our danger was too great and\nimminent to permit of a moment's relaxation from our exertions.  No hope\nnow animated our bosoms; but a feeling of despair, strange to say, lent\nus power to work, and nerved our arms with such energy, that it was\nseveral hours ere the savages overtook us.  When we saw that there was\nindeed no chance of escape, and that paddling any longer would only serve\nto exhaust our strength, without doing any good, we turned the side of\nour canoe towards the approaching enemy, and laid down our paddles.\n\nSilently, and with a look of bitter determination on his face, Jack\nlifted one of the light boat-oars that we had brought with us, and,\nresting it on his shoulder, stood up in an attitude of bold defiance.\nPeterkin took the other oar and also stood up, but there was no anger\nvisible on his countenance.  When not sparkling with fun, it usually wore\na mild, sad expression, which was deepened on the present occasion, as he\nglanced at Avatea, who sat with her face resting in her hands upon her\nknees.  Without knowing very well what I intended to do, I also arose and\ngrasped my paddle with both hands.\n\nOn came the large canoe like a war-horse of the deep, with the foam\ncurling from its sharp bow, and the spear-heads of the savages glancing\nthe beams of the rising sun.  Perfect silence was maintained on both\nsides, and we could hear the hissing water, and see the frowning eyes of\nthe warriors, as they came rushing on.  When about twenty yards distant,\nfive or six of the savages in the bow rose, and, laying aside their\npaddles, took up their spears.  Jack and Peterkin raised their oars,\nwhile, with a feeling of madness whirling in my brain, I grasped my\npaddle and prepared for the onset.  But, before any of us could strike a\nblow, the sharp prow of the war-canoe struck us like a thunderbolt on the\nside, and hurled us into the sea!\n\nWhat occurred after this I cannot tell, for I was nearly drowned; but\nwhen I recovered from the state of insensibility into which I had been\nthrown, I found myself stretched on my back, bound hand and foot between\nJack and Peterkin, in the bottom of the large canoe.\n\nIn this condition we lay the whole day, during which time the savages\nonly rested one hour.  When night came, they rested again for another\nhour, and appeared to sleep just as they sat.  But we were neither\nunbound nor allowed to speak to each other during the voyage, nor was a\nmorsel of food or a draught of water given to us.  For food, however, we\ncared little; but we would have given much for a drop of water to cool\nour parched lips, and we would have been glad, too, had they loosened the\ncords that bound us, for they were tightly fastened and occasioned us\nmuch pain.  The air, also, was unusually hot, so much so that I felt\nconvinced that a storm was brewing.  This also added to our sufferings.\nHowever, these were at length relieved by our arrival at the island from\nwhich we had fled.\n\nWhile we were being led ashore, we caught a glimpse of Avatea, who was\nseated in the hinder part of the canoe.  She was not fettered in any way.\nOur captors now drove us before them towards the hut of Tararo, at which\nwe speedily arrived, and found the chief seated with an expression on his\nface that boded us no good.  Our friend the teacher stood beside him,\nwith a look of anxiety on his mild features.\n\n\"How comes it,\" said Tararo, turning to the teacher, \"that these youths\nhave abused our hospitality?\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" replied Jack, \"that we have not abused his hospitality, for\nhis hospitality has not been extended to us.  I came to the island to\ndeliver Avatea, and my only regret is that I have failed to do so.  If I\nget another chance, I will try to save her yet.\"\n\nThe teacher shook his head.  \"Nay, my young friend, I had better not tell\nhim that.  It will only incense him.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" replied Jack.  \"If you don't tell him that, you'll tell him\nnothing, for I won't say anything softer.\"\n\nOn hearing Jack's speech, Tararo frowned and his eye flashed with anger.\n\n\"Go,\" he said, \"presumptuous boy.  My debt to you is cancelled.  You and\nyour companions shall die.\"\n\nAs he spoke he rose and signed to several of his attendants, who seized\nJack, and Peterkin, and me, violently by the collars, and, dragging us\nfrom the hut of the chief, led us through the wood to the outskirts of\nthe village.  Here they thrust us into a species of natural cave in a\ncliff, and, having barricaded the entrance, left us in total darkness.\n\nAfter feeling about for some time--for our legs were unshackled, although\nour wrists were still bound with thongs--we found a low ledge of rock\nrunning along one side of the cavern.  On this we seated ourselves, and\nfor a long time maintained unbroken silence.\n\nAt last I could restrain my feelings no longer.  \"Alas! dear Jack and\nPeterkin,\" said I, \"what is to become of us?  I fear that we are doomed\nto die.\"\n\n\"I know not,\" replied Jack, in a tremulous voice, \"I know not; Ralph, I\nregret deeply the hastiness of my violent temper, which, I must confess,\nhas been the chief cause of our being brought to this sad condition.\nPerhaps the teacher may do something for us.  But I have little hope.\"\n\n\"Ah! no,\" said Peterkin, with a heavy sigh; \"I am sure he can't help us.\nTararo doesn't care more for him than for one of his dogs.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said I, \"there seems no chance of deliverance, unless the\nAlmighty puts forth his arm to save us.  Yet I must say that I have great\nhope, my comrades, for we have come to this dark place by no fault of\nours--unless it be a fault to try to succour a woman in distress.\"\n\nI was interrupted in my remarks by a noise at the entrance to the cavern,\nwhich was caused by the removal of the barricade.  Immediately after,\nthree men entered, and, taking us by the collars of our coats, led us\naway through the forest.  As we advanced, we heard much shouting and\nbeating of native drums in the village, and at first we thought that our\nguards were conducting us to the hut of Tararo again.  But in this we\nwere mistaken.  The beating of drums gradually increased, and soon after\nwe observed a procession of the natives coming towards us.  At the head\nof this procession we were placed, and then we all advanced together\ntowards the temple where human victims were wont to be sacrificed!\n\nA thrill of horror ran through my heart as I recalled to mind the awful\nscenes that I had before witnessed at that dreadful spot.  But\ndeliverance came suddenly from a quarter whence we little expected it.\nDuring the whole of that day there had been an unusual degree of heat in\nthe atmosphere, and the sky assumed that lurid aspect which portends a\nthunder-storm.  Just as we were approaching the horrid temple, a growl of\nthunder burst overhead and heavy drops of rain began to fall.\n\nThose who have not witnessed gales and storms in tropical regions can\nform but a faint conception of the fearful hurricane that burst upon the\nisland of Mango at this time.  Before we reached the temple, the storm\nburst upon us with a deafening roar, and the natives, who knew too well\nthe devastation that was to follow, fled right and left through the woods\nin order to save their property, leaving us alone in the midst of the\nhowling storm.  The trees around us bent before the blast like willows,\nand we were about to flee in order to seek shelter, when the teacher ran\ntoward us with a knife in his hand.\n\n\"Thank the Lord,\" he said, cutting our bonds, \"I am in time!  Now, seek\nthe shelter of the nearest rock.\"\n\nThis we did without a moment's hesitation, for the whistling wind burst,\never and anon, like thunder-claps among the trees, and, tearing them from\ntheir roots, hurled them with violence to the ground.  Rain cut across\nthe land in sheets, and lightning played like forked serpents in the air;\nwhile, high above the roar of the hissing tempest, the thunder crashed,\nand burst, and rolled in awful majesty.\n\nIn the village the scene was absolutely appalling.  Roofs were blown\ncompletely off the houses in many cases; and in others, the houses\nthemselves were levelled with the ground.  In the midst of this, the\nnatives were darting to and fro, in some instances saving their goods,\nbut in many others seeking to save themselves from the storm of\ndestruction that whirled around them.  But, terrific although the tempest\nwas on land, it was still more tremendous on the mighty ocean.  Billows\nsprang, as it were, from the great deep, and while their crests were\nabsolutely scattered into white mist, they fell upon the beach with a\ncrash that seemed to shake the solid land.  But they did not end there.\nEach successive wave swept higher and higher on the beach, until the\nocean lashed its angry waters among the trees and bushes, and at length,\nin a sheet of white curdled foam, swept into the village and upset and\ncarried off, or dashed into wreck, whole rows of the native dwellings!  It\nwas a sublime, an awful scene, calculated, in some degree at least, to\nimpress the mind of beholders with the might and the majesty of God.\n\nWe found shelter in a cave that night and all the next day, during which\ntime the storm raged in fury; but on the night following it abated\nsomewhat, and in the morning we went to the village to seek for food,\nbeing so famished with hunger that we lost all feeling of danger and all\nwish to escape in our desire to satisfy the cravings of nature.  But no\nsooner had we obtained food than we began to wish that we had rather\nendeavoured to make our escape into the mountains.  This we attempted to\ndo soon afterwards, but the natives were now able to look after us, and\non our showing a disposition to avoid observation and make towards the\nmountains, we were seized by three warriors, who once more bound our\nwrists and thrust us into our former prison.\n\nIt is true Jack made a vigorous resistance, and knocked down the first\nsavage who seized him, with a well-directed blow of his fist, but he was\nspeedily overpowered by others.  Thus we were again prisoners, with the\nprospect of torture and a violent death before us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\nImprisonment--Sinking hopes--Unexpected freedom to more than one, and in\nmore senses than one.\n\nFor a long long month we remained in our dark and dreary prison, during\nwhich dismal time we did not see the face of a human being, except that\nof the silent savage who brought us our daily food.\n\nThere have been one or two seasons in my life during which I have felt as\nif the darkness of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart\ncould never pass away, until death should make me cease to feel the\npresent was such a season.\n\nDuring the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill at our\nhearts every time we heard a foot-fall near the cave--dreading lest it\nshould prove to be that of our executioner.  But as time dragged heavily\non, we ceased to feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep,\nirrepressible longing for freedom, that we chafed and fretted in our\nconfinement like tigers.  Then a feeling of despair came over us, and we\nactually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to die!\nBut these changes took place very gradually, and were mingled sometimes\nwith brighter thoughts; for there were times when we sat in that dark\ncavern on our ledge of rock and conversed almost pleasantly about the\npast, until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present.  But we seldom\nventured to touch upon the future.\n\nA few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed; and a scanty supply of\nyams and taro, brought to us once a-day, constituted our food.\n\n\"Well, Ralph, how have you slept?\" said Jack, in a listless tone, on\nrising one morning from his humble couch.  \"Were you much disturbed by\nthe wind last night?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"I dreamed of home all night, and I thought that my mother\nsmiled upon me, and beckoned me to go to her; but I could not, for I was\nchained.\"\n\n\"And I dreamed, too,\" said Peterkin; \"but it was of our happy home on the\nCoral Island.  I thought we were swimming in the Water Garden; then the\nsavages gave a yell, and we were immediately in the cave at Spouting\nCliff, which, somehow or other, changed into this gloomy cavern; and I\nawoke to find it true.\"\n\nPeterkin's tone was so much altered by the depressing influence of his\nlong imprisonment, that, had I not known it was he who spoke, I should\nscarcely have recognised it, so sad was it, and so unlike to the merry,\ncheerful voice we had been accustomed to hear.  I pondered this much, and\nthought of the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human\nbeings in so short a time; how bright the sunshine in the sky at one\ntime, and, in a short space, how dark the overshadowing cloud!  I had no\ndoubt that the Bible would have given me much light and comfort on this\nsubject, if I had possessed one, and I once more had occasion to regret\ndeeply having neglected to store my memory with its consoling truths.\n\nWhile I meditated thus, Peterkin again broke the silence of the cave, by\nsaying, in a melancholy tone, \"Oh, I wonder if we shall ever see our dear\nisland more.\"\n\nHis voice trembled, and, covering his face with both hands, he bent down\nhis head and wept.  It was an unusual sight for me to see our once joyous\ncompanion in tears, and I felt a burning desire to comfort him; but,\nalas! what could I say?  I could hold out no hope; and although I essayed\ntwice to speak, the words refused to pass my lips.  While I hesitated,\nJack sat down beside him, and whispered a few words in his ear, while\nPeterkin threw himself on his friend's breast, and rested his head on his\nshoulder.\n\nThus we sat for some time in deep silence.  Soon after, we heard\nfootsteps at the entrance of the cave, and immediately our jailer\nentered.  We were so much accustomed to his regular visits, however, that\nwe paid little attention to him, expecting that he would set down our\nmeagre fare, as usual, and depart.  But, to our surprise, instead of\ndoing so, he advanced towards us with a knife in his hand, and, going up\nto Jack, he cut the thongs that bound his wrists, then he did the same to\nPeterkin and me!  For fully five minutes we stood in speechless\namazement, with our freed hands hanging idly by our sides.  The first\nthought that rushed into my mind was, that the time had come to put us to\ndeath; and although, as I have said before, we actually wished for death\nin the strength of our despair, now that we thought it drew really near I\nfelt all the natural love of life revive in my heart, mingled with a\nchill of horror at the suddenness of our call.\n\nBut I was mistaken.  After cutting our bonds, the savage pointed to the\ncave's mouth, and we marched, almost mechanically, into the open air.\nHere, to our surprise, we found the teacher standing under a tree, with\nhis hands clasped before him, and the tears trickling down his dark\ncheeks.  On seeing Jack, who came out first, he sprang towards him, and\nclasping him in his arms, exclaimed,--\n\n\"Oh! my dear young friend, through the great goodness of God you are\nfree!\"\n\n\"Free!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Ay, free,\" repeated the teacher, shaking us warmly by the hands again\nand again; \"free to go and come as you will.  The Lord has unloosed the\nbands of the captive and set the prisoners free.  A missionary has been\nsent to us, and Tararo has embraced the Christian religion!  The people\nare even now burning their gods of wood!  Come, my dear friends, and see\nthe glorious sight.\"\n\nWe could scarcely credit our senses.  So long had we been accustomed in\nour cavern to dream of deliverance, that we imagined for a moment this\nmust surely be nothing more than another vivid dream.  Our eyes and minds\nwere dazzled, too, by the brilliant sunshine, which almost blinded us\nafter our long confinement to the gloom of our prison, so that we felt\ngiddy with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our throbbing\nbosoms; but as we followed the footsteps of our sable friend, and beheld\nthe bright foliage of the trees, and heard the cries of the paroquets,\nand smelt the rich perfume of the flowering shrubs, the truth, that we\nwere really delivered from prison and from death, rushed with\noverwhelming power into our souls, and, with one accord, while tears\nsprang to our eyes, we uttered a loud long cheer of joy.\n\nIt was replied to by a shout from a number of the natives who chanced to\nbe near.  Running towards us, they shook us by the hand with every\ndemonstration of kindly feeling.  They then fell behind, and, forming a\nsort of procession, conducted us to the dwelling of Tararo.\n\nThe scene that met our eyes here was one that I shall never forget.  On a\nrude bench in front of his house sat the chief.  A native stood on his\nleft hand, who, from his dress, seemed to be a teacher.  On his right\nstood an English gentleman, who, I at once and rightly concluded, was a\nmissionary.  He was tall, thin, and apparently past forty, with a bald\nforehead, and thin gray hair.  The expression of his countenance was the\nmost winning I ever saw, and his clear gray eye beamed with a look that\nwas frank, fearless, loving, and truthful.  In front of the chief was an\nopen space, in the centre of which lay a pile of wooden idols, ready to\nbe set on fire; and around these were assembled thousands of natives, who\nhad come to join in or to witness the unusual sight.  A bright smile\noverspread the missionary's face as he advanced quickly to meet us, and\nhe shook us warmly by the hands.\n\n\"I am overjoyed to meet you, my dear young friends,\" he said.  \"My\nfriend, and your friend, the teacher, has told me your history; and I\nthank our Father in heaven, with all my heart, that he has guided me to\nthis island, and made me the instrument of saving you.\"\n\nWe thanked the missionary most heartily, and asked him in some surprise\nhow he had succeeded in turning the heart of Tararo in our favour.\n\n\"I will tell you that at a more convenient time,\" he answered, \"meanwhile\nwe must not forget the respect due to the chief.  He waits to receive\nyou.\"\n\nIn the conversation that immediately followed between us and Tararo, the\nlatter said that the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had been sent to\nthe island, and that to it we were indebted for our freedom.  Moreover,\nhe told us that we were at liberty to depart in our schooner whenever we\npleased, and that we should be supplied with as much provision as we\nrequired.  He concluded by shaking hands with us warmly, and performing\nthe ceremony of rubbing noses.\n\nThis was indeed good news to us, and we could hardly find words to\nexpress our gratitude to the chief and to the missionary.\n\n\"And what of Avatea?\" inquired Jack.\n\nThe missionary replied by pointing to a group of natives in the midst of\nwhom the girl stood.  Beside her was a tall, strapping fellow, whose\nnoble mien and air of superiority bespoke him a chief of no ordinary\nkind.\n\n\"That youth is her lover.  He came this very morning in his war-canoe to\ntreat with Tararo for Avatea.  He is to be married in a few days, and\nafterwards returns to his island home with his bride!\"\n\n\"That's capital,\" said Jack, as he stepped up to the savage and gave him\na hearty shake of the hand.  \"I wish you joy, my lad;--and you too,\nAvatea.\"\n\nAs Jack spoke, Avatea's lover took him by the hand and led him to the\nspot where Tararo and the missionary stood, surrounded by most of the\nchief men of the tribe.  The girl herself followed, and stood on his left\nhand while her lover stood on his right, and, commanding silence, made\nthe following speech, which was translated by the missionary:--\n\n\"Young friend, you have seen few years, but your head is old.  Your heart\nalso is large and very brave.  I and Avatea are your debtors, and we\nwish, in the midst of this assembly, to acknowledge our debt, and to say\nthat it is one which we can never repay.  You have risked your life for\none who was known to you only for a few days.  But she was a woman in\ndistress, and that was enough to secure to her the aid of a Christian\nman.  We, who live in these islands of the sea, know that the true\nChristians always act thus.  Their religion is one of love and kindness.\nWe thank God that so many Christians have been sent here--we hope many\nmore will come.  Remember that I and Avatea will think of you and pray\nfor you and your brave comrades when you are far away.\"\n\nTo this kind speech Jack returned a short sailor-like reply, in which he\ninsisted that he had only done for Avatea what he would have done for any\nwoman under the sun.  But Jack's forte did not lie in speech-making, so\nhe terminated rather abruptly by seizing the chief's hand and shaking it\nviolently, after which he made a hasty retreat.\n\n\"Now, then, Ralph and Peterkin,\" said Jack, as we mingled with the crowd,\n\"it seems to me that the object we came here for having been\nsatisfactorily accomplished, we have nothing more to do but get ready for\nsea as fast as we can, and hurrah for dear old England!\"\n\n\"That's my idea precisely,\" said Peterkin, endeavouring to wink, but he\nhad wept so much of late, poor fellow, that he found it difficult;\n\"however, I'm not going away till I see these fellows burn their gods.\"\n\nPeterkin had his wish, for, in a few minutes afterwards, fire was put to\nthe pile, the roaring flames ascended, and, amid the acclamations of the\nassembled thousands, the false gods of Mango were reduced to ashes!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\nConclusion.\n\nTo part is the lot of all mankind.  The world is a scene of constant\nleave-taking, and the hands that grasp in cordial greeting to-day, are\ndoomed ere long to unite for the last time, when the quivering lips\npronounce the word--\"Farewell.\"  It is a sad thought, but should we on\nthat account exclude it from our minds?  May not a lesson worth learning\nbe gathered in the contemplation of it?  May it not, perchance, teach us\nto devote our thoughts more frequently and attentively to that land where\nwe meet, but part no more?\n\nHow many do we part from in this world with a light \"Good-bye,\" whom we\nnever see again!  Often do I think, in my meditations on this subject,\nthat if we realized more fully the shortness of the fleeting intercourse\nthat we have in this world with many of our fellow-men, we would try more\nearnestly to do them good, to give them a friendly smile, as it were, in\npassing (for the longest intercourse on earth is little more than a\npassing word and glance), and show that we have sympathy with them in the\nshort quick struggle of life, by our kindly words and looks and action.\n\nThe time soon drew near when we were to quit the islands of the South\nSeas; and, strange though it may appear, we felt deep regret at parting\nwith the natives of the island of Mango; for, after they embraced the\nChristian faith, they sought, by showing us the utmost kindness, to\ncompensate for the harsh treatment we had experienced at their hands; and\nwe felt a growing affection for the native teachers and the missionary,\nand especially for Avatea and her husband.\n\nBefore leaving, we had many long and interesting conversations with the\nmissionary, in one of which he told us that he had been making for the\nisland of Raratonga when his native-built sloop was blown out of its\ncourse, during a violent gale, and driven to this island.  At first the\nnatives refused to listen to what he had to say; but, after a week's\nresidence among them, Tararo came to him and said that he wished to\nbecome a Christian, and would burn his idols.  He proved himself to be\nsincere, for, as we have seen, he persuaded all his people to do\nlikewise.  I use the word persuaded advisedly; for, like all the other\nFeejee chiefs, Tararo was a despot and might have commanded obedience to\nhis wishes; but he entered so readily into the spirit of the new faith\nthat he perceived at once the impropriety of using constraint in the\npropagation of it.  He set the example, therefore; and that example was\nfollowed by almost every man of the tribe.\n\nDuring the short time that we remained at the island, repairing our\nvessel and getting her ready for sea, the natives had commenced building\na large and commodious church, under the superintendence of the\nmissionary, and several rows of new cottages were marked out; so that the\nplace bid fair to become, in a few months, as prosperous and beautiful as\nthe Christian village at the other end of the island.\n\nAfter Avatea was married, she and her husband were sent away, loaded with\npresents, chiefly of an edible nature.  One of the native teachers went\nwith them, for the purpose of visiting still more distant islands of the\nsea, and spreading, if possible, the light of the glorious gospel there.\n\nAs the missionary intended to remain for several weeks longer, in order\nto encourage and confirm his new converts, Jack and Peterkin and I held a\nconsultation in the cabin of our schooner,--which we found just as we had\nleft her, for everything that had been taken out of her was restored.  We\nnow resolved to delay our departure no longer.  The desire to see our\nbeloved native land was strong upon us, and we could not wait.\n\nThree natives volunteered to go with us to Tahiti, where we thought it\nlikely that we should be able to procure a sufficient crew of sailors to\nman our vessel; so we accepted their offer gladly.\n\nIt was a bright clear morning when we hoisted the snow-white sails of the\npirate schooner and left the shores of Mango.  The missionary, and\nthousands of the natives, came down to bid us God-speed, and to see us\nsail away.  As the vessel bent before a light fair wind, we glided\nquickly over the lagoon under a cloud of canvass.\n\nJust as we passed through the channel in the reef the natives gave us a\nloud cheer; and as the missionary waved his hat, while he stood on a\ncoral rock with his gray hairs floating in the wind, we heard the single\nword \"Farewell\" borne faintly over the sea.\n\nThat night, as we sat on the taffrail, gazing out upon the wide sea and\nup into the starry firmament, a thrill of joy, strangely mixed with\nsadness, passed through our hearts,--for we were at length \"homeward\nbound,\" and were gradually leaving far behind us the beautiful, bright,\ngreen, coral islands of the Pacific Ocean.\n",
