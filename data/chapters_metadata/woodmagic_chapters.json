SIR BEVIS.\n\n\nOne morning as little \"Sir\" Bevis [such was his pet name] was digging in\nthe farmhouse garden, he saw a daisy, and throwing aside his spade, he\nsat down on the grass to pick the flower to pieces. He pulled the\npink-tipped petals off one by one, and as they dropped they were lost.\nNext he gathered a bright dandelion, and squeezed the white juice from\nthe hollow stem, which drying presently, left his fingers stained with\nbrown spots. Then he drew forth a bennet from its sheath, and bit and\nsucked it till his teeth were green from the sap. Lying at full length,\nhe drummed the earth with his toes, while the tall grass blades tickled\nhis cheeks.\n\nPresently, rolling on his back, he drummed again with his heels. He\nlooked up at the blue sky, but only for a moment, because the glare of\nlight was too strong in his eyes. After a minute, he turned on his side,\nthrust out one arm, placed his head on it, and drew up one knee, as if\ngoing to sleep. His little brown wrist, bared by the sleeve shortening\nas he extended his arm, bent down the grass, and his still browner\nfingers played with the blades, and every now and then tore one off.\n\nA flutter of wings sounded among the blossom on an apple-tree close by,\nand instantly Bevis sat up, knowing it must be a goldfinch thinking of\nbuilding a nest in the branches. If the trunk of the tree had not been\nso big, he would have tried to climb it at once, but he knew he could\nnot do it, nor could he see the bird for the leaves and bloom. A puff of\nwind came and showered the petals down upon him; they fell like\nsnowflakes on his face and dotted the grass.\n\nBuzz! A great bumble-bee, with a band of red gold across his back, flew\nup, and hovered near, wavering to and fro in the air as he stayed to\nlook at a flower.\n\nBuzz! Bevis listened, and knew very well what he was saying. It was:\n\"This is a sweet little garden, my darling; a very pleasant garden; all\ngrass and daisies, and apple-trees, and narrow patches with flowers and\nfruit-trees one side, and a wall and currant-bushes another side, and a\nlow box-hedge and a haha, where you can see the high mowing grass quite\nunderneath you; and a round summer-house in the corner, painted as blue\ninside as a hedge-sparrow's egg is outside; and then another haha with\niron railings, which you are always climbing up, Bevis, on the fourth\nside, with stone steps leading down to a meadow, where the cows are\nfeeding, and where they have left all the buttercups standing as tall\nas your waist, sir. The gate in the iron railings is not fastened, and\nbesides, there is a gap in the box-hedge, and it is easy to drop down\nthe haha wall, but that is mowing grass there. You know very well you\ncould not come to any harm in the meadow; they said you were not to go\noutside the garden, but that's all nonsense, and very stupid. _I_ am\ngoing outside the garden, Bevis. Good-morning, dear.\" Buzz! And the\ngreat bumble-bee flew slowly between the iron railings, out among the\nbuttercups, and away up the field.\n\nBevis went to the railings, and stood on the lowest bar; then he opened\nthe gate a little way, but it squeaked so loud upon its rusty hinges\nthat he let it shut again. He walked round the garden along beside the\nbox-hedge to the patch by the lilac trees; they were single lilacs,\nwhich are much more beautiful than the double, and all bowed down with a\nmass of bloom. Some rhubarb grew there, and to bring it up the faster,\nthey had put a round wooden box on it, hollowed out from the sawn butt\nof an elm, which was rotten within and easily scooped. The top was\ncovered with an old board, and every time that Bevis passed he lifted up\nthe corner of the board and peeped in, to see if the large red, swelling\nknobs were yet bursting.\n\nOne of these round wooden boxes had been split and spoilt, and half of\nit was left lying with the hollow part downwards. Under this shelter a\ntoad had his house. Bevis peered in at him, and touched him with a twig\nto make him move an inch or two, for he was so lazy, and sat there all\nday long, except when it rained. Sometimes the toad told him a story,\nbut not very often, for he was a silent old philosopher, and not very\nfond of anybody. He had a nephew, quite a lively young fellow, in the\ncucumber frame on the other side of the lilac bushes, at whom Bevis also\npeered nearly every day after they had lifted the frame and propped it\nup with wedges.\n\nThe gooseberries were no bigger than beads, but he tasted two, and then\na thrush began to sing on an ash-tree in the hedge of the meadow.\n\"Bevis! Bevis!\" said the thrush, and he turned round to listen: \"My\ndearest Bevis, have you forgotten the meadow, and the buttercups, and\nthe sorrel? You know the sorrel, don't you, that tastes so pleasant if\nyou nibble the leaf? And I have a nest in the bushes, not very far up\nthe hedge, and you may take just one egg; there are only two yet. But\ndon't tell any more boys about it, or we shall not have one left. That\nis a very sweet garden, but it is very small. I like all these fields to\nfly about in, and the swallows fly ever so much farther than I can; so\nfar away and so high, that I cannot tell you how they find their way\nhome to the chimney. But they will tell you, if you ask them.\nGood-morning! I am going over the brook.\"\n\nBevis went to the iron railings and got up two bars, and looked over;\nbut he could not yet make up his mind, so he went inside the\nsummer-house, which had one small round window. All the lower part of\nthe blue walls was scribbled and marked with pencil, where he had\nwritten and drawn, and put down his ideas and notes. The lines were\nsomewhat intermingled, and crossed each other, and some stretched out\nlong distances, and came back in sharp angles. But Bevis knew very well\nwhat he meant when he wrote it all. Taking a stump of cedar pencil from\nhis pocket, one end of it much gnawn, he added a few scrawls to the\ninscriptions, and then stood on the seat to look out of the round\nwindow, which was darkened by an old cobweb.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a very cunning spider--a very cunning spider\nindeed. The old toad by the rhubarb told Bevis there had not been such a\ncunning spider for many summers; he knew almost as much about flies as\nthe old toad, and caught such a great number, that the toad began to\nthink there would be none left for him. Now the toad was extremely fond\nof flies, and he watched the spider with envy, and grew more angry about\nit every day.\n\nAs he sat blinking and winking by the rhubarb in his house all day long,\nthe toad never left off thinking, thinking, thinking about the spider.\nAnd as he kept thinking, thinking, thinking, so he told Bevis, he\nrecollected that he knew a great deal about a good many other things\nbesides flies. So one day, after several weeks of thinking, he crawled\nout of his house in the sunshine, which he did not like at all, and went\nacross the grass to the iron railings, where the spider had then got his\nweb. The spider saw him coming, and being very proud of his cleverness,\nbegan to taunt and tease him.\n\n\"Your back is all over warts, and you are an old toad,\" he\nsaid. \"You are so old, that I heard the swallows saying their\ngreat-great-great-grandmothers, when they built in the chimney, did\nnot know when you were born. And you have got foolish, and past doing\nanything, and so stupid that you hardly know when it is going to rain.\nWhy, the sun is shining bright, you stupid old toad, and there isn't a\nchance of a single drop falling. You look very ugly down there in the\ngrass. Now, don't you wish that you were me and could catch more flies\nthan you could eat? Why, I can catch wasps and bees, and tie them up so\ntight with my threads that they cannot sting nor even move their wings,\nnor so much as wriggle their bodies. I am the very cleverest and most\ncunning spider that ever lived.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you are,\" replied the toad. \"I have been thinking so all the\nsummer; and so much do I admire you, that I have come all this way,\nacross in the hot sun, to tell you something.\"\n\n\"Tell _me_ something!\" said the spider, much offended, \"_I_ know\neverything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, honoured sir,\" said the toad; \"you have such wonderful eyes,\nand such a sharp mind, it is true that you know everything about the\nsun, and the moon, and the earth, and flies. But, as you have studied\nall these great and important things, you could hardly see all the very\nlittle trifles like a poor old toad.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can. I know everything--everything!\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" went on the toad so humbly, \"this is such a little--such a\nvery little--thing, and a spider like you, in such a high position of\nlife, could not mind me telling you such a mere nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't mind,\" said the spider--\"you may go on, and tell me, if\nyou like.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the toad, \"while I have been sitting in my hole, I\nhave noticed that such a lot of the flies that come into this garden\npresently go into the summer-house there, and when they are in the\nsummer-house, they always go to that little round window, which is\nsometimes quite black with them; for it is the nature of flies to buzz\nover glass.\"\n\n\"I do not know so much about that,\" said the spider; \"for I have never\nlived in houses, being an independent insect; but it is possible you may\nbe right. At any rate, it is not of much consequence. You had better go\nup into the window, old toad.\" Now this was a sneer on the part of the\nspider.\n\n\"But I can't climb up into the window,\" said the toad; \"all I can do is\nto crawl about the ground, but you can run up a wall quickly. How I do\nwish I was a spider, like you. Oh, dear!\" And then the toad turned\nround, after bowing to the clever spider, and went back to his hole.\n\nNow the spider was secretly very much mortified and angry with himself,\nbecause he had not noticed this about the flies going to the window in\nthe summer-house. At first he said to himself that it was not true; but\nhe could not help looking that way now and then, and every time he\nlooked, there was the window crowded with flies. They had all the garden\nto buzz about in, and all the fields, but instead of wandering under\nthe trees, and over the flowers, they preferred to go into the\nsummer-house and crawl over the glass of the little window, though it\nwas very dirty from so many feet. For a long time, the spider was too\nproud to go there too; but one day such a splendid blue-bottle fly got\nin the window and made such a tremendous buzzing, that he could not\nresist it any more.\n\nSo he left his web by the railings, and climbed up the blue-painted\nwall, over Bevis's writings and marks, and spun such a web in the window\nas had never before been seen. It was the largest and the finest, and\nthe most beautifully-arranged web that had ever been made, and it caught\nsuch a number of flies that the spider grew fatter every day. In a\nweek's time he was so big that he could no longer hide in the crack he\nhad chosen, he was quite a giant; and the toad came across the grass one\nnight and looked at him, but the spider was now so bloated he would not\nrecognise the toad.\n\nBut one morning a robin came to the iron railings, and perched on the\ntop, and put his head a little on one side, to show his black eye the\nbetter. Then he flew inside the summer-house, alighted in the window,\nand gobbled up the spider in an instant. The old toad shut his eye and\nopened it again, and went on thinking, for that was just what he knew\nwould happen. Ever so many times in his very long life he had seen\nspiders go up there, but no sooner had they got fat than a robin or a\nwren came in and ate them. Some of the clever spider's web was there\nstill when Bevis looked out of the window, all dusty and draggled, with\nthe skins and wings of some gnats and a dead leaf entangled in it.\n\nAs he looked, a white butterfly came along the meadow, and instantly he\nran out, flung open the gate, rushed down the steps, and taking no heed\nof the squeak the gate made as it shut behind him, raced after the\nbutterfly.\n\nThe tall buttercups brushed his knees, and bent on either side as if a\nwind was rushing through them. A bennet slipped up his knickerbockers\nand tickled his leg. His toes only touched the ground, neither his heels\nnor the hollow of his foot; and from so light a pressure the grass,\nbowed but not crushed, rose up, leaving no more mark of his passage than\nif a grasshopper had gone by.\n\nDaintily fanning himself with his wings, the butterfly went before\nBevis, not yet knowing that he was chased, but sauntering along just\nabove the buttercups. He peeped as he flew under the lids of the\nflowers' eyes, to see if any of them loved him. There was a glossy green\nleaf which he thought he should like to feel, it looked so soft and\nsatin-like. So he alighted on it, and then saw Bevis coming, his hat on\nthe very back of his head, and his hand stretched out to catch him. The\nbutterfly wheeled himself round on the leaf, shut up his wings, and\nseemed so innocent, till Bevis fell on his knee, and then under his\nfingers there was nothing but the leaf. His cheek flushed, his eye lit\nup, and away he darted again after the butterfly, which had got several\nyards ahead before he could recover himself. He ran now faster than\never.\n\n\"Race on,\" said the buttercups; \"race on, Bevis; that butterfly disdains\nus because we are so many, and all alike.\"\n\n\"Be quick,\" said a great moon-daisy to him; \"catch him, dear. I asked\nhim to stay and tell me a story, but he would not.\"\n\n\"Never mind me,\" said the clover; \"you may step on me if you like,\nlove.\"\n\n\"But just look at me for a moment, pet, as you go by,\" cried the purple\nvetch by the hedge.\n\nA colt in the field, seeing Bevis running so fast, thought he too must\njoin the fun, so he whisked his tail, stretched his long floundering\nlegs, and galloped away. Then the mare whinnied and galloped too, and\nthe ground shook under her heavy hoofs. The cows lifted their heads from\ngathering the grass close round the slender bennets, and wondered why\nany one could be so foolish as to rush about, when there was plenty to\neat and no hurry.\n\nThe cunning deceitful butterfly, so soon as Bevis came near, turned\naside and went along a furrow. Bevis, running in the furrow, caught his\nfoot in the long creepers of the crowfoot, and fell down bump, and\npricked his hand with a thistle. Up he jumped again, red as a peony, and\nshouting in his rage, ran on so quickly that he nearly overtook the\nbutterfly. But they were now nearer the other hedge. The butterfly,\nfrightened at the shouting and Bevis's resolution, rose over the\nbrambles, and Bevis stopping short flung his hat at him. The hat did not\nhit the butterfly, but the wind it made puffed him round, and so\nfrightened him, that he flew up half as high as the elms, and went into\nthe next field.\n\nWhen Bevis looked down, there was his hat, hung on a branch of ash, far\nbeyond his reach. He could not touch the lowest leaf, jump as much as he\nwould. His next thought was a stone to throw, but there were none in the\nmeadow. Then he put his hand in his jacket pocket for his knife, to cut\na long stick. It was not in that pocket, nor in the one on the other\nside, nor in his knickers. Now the knife was Bevis's greatest\ntreasure--his very greatest. He looked all round bewildered, and the\ntears rose in his eyes.\n\nJust then Pan, the spaniel, who had worked his head loose from the\ncollar and followed him, ran out of the hedge between Bevis's legs with\nsuch joyful force, that Bevis was almost overthrown, and burst into a\nfit of laughter. Pan ran back into the hedge to hunt, and Bevis, with\ntears rolling down his cheeks into the dimples made by his smiles,\ndropped on hands and knees and crept in after the dog under the briars.\nOn the bank there was a dead grey stick, a branch that had fallen from\nthe elms. It was heavy, but Bevis heaved it up, and pushed it through\nthe boughs and thrust his hat off.\n\nCreeping out again, he put it on, and remembering his knife, walked out\ninto the field to search for it. When Pan missed him, he followed, and\npresently catching scent of a rabbit, the spaniel rushed down a furrow,\nwhich happened to be the very furrow where Bevis had tumbled. Going\nafter Pan, Bevis found his knife in the grass, where it had dropped when\nshaken from his pocket by the jerk of his fall. He opened the single\nblade it contained at once, and went back to the hedge to cut a stick.\nAs he walked along the hedge, he thought the briar was too prickly to\ncut, and the thorn was too hard, and the ash was too big, and the willow\nhad no knob, and the elder smelt so strong, and the sapling oak was\nacross the ditch, and out of reach, and the maple had such rough bark.\nSo he wandered along a great way through that field and the next, and\npresently saw a nut-tree stick that promised well, for the sticks grew\nstraight, and not too big.\n\nHe jumped into the ditch, climbed half up the mound, and began to cut\naway at one of the rods, leaning his left arm on the moss-grown stole.\nThe bark was easily cut through, and he soon made a notch, but then the\nwood seemed to grow harder, and the chips he got out were very small.\nThe harder the wood, the more determined Bevis became, and he cut and\nworked away with such force that his chest heaved, his brow was set and\nfrowning, and his jacket all green from rubbing against the hazel.\nSuddenly something passed between him and the light. He looked up, and\nthere was Pan, whom he had forgotten, in the hedge looking down at him.\n\"Pan! Pan!\" cried Bevis. Pan wagged his tail, but ran back, and Bevis,\nforsaking his stick, scrambled up into the stole, then into the mound,\nand through a gap into the next field. Pan was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThere was a large mossy root under a great oak, and, hot with his\ncutting, Bevis sat down upon it. Along came a house martin, the kind of\nswallow that has a white band across his back, flying very low, and only\njust above the grass. The swallow flew to and fro not far from Bevis,\nwho watched it, and presently asked him to come closer. But the swallow\nsaid: \"I shall not come any nearer, Bevis. Don't you remember what you\ndid last year, sir? Don't you remember Bill, the carter's boy, put a\nladder against the wall, and you climbed up the ladder, and put your\npaw, all brown and dirty, into my nest and took my eggs? And you tried\nto string them on a bennet, but the bennet was too big, so you went\nindoors for some thread. And you made my wife and me dreadfully unhappy,\nand we said we would never come back any more to your house, Bevis.\"\n\n\"But you have come back, swallow.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have come back--just once more; but if you do it again we shall\ngo away for ever.\"\n\n\"But I won't do it again; no, that I won't! Do come near.\"\n\nSo the swallow came a little nearer, only two yards away, and flew\nbackwards and forwards, and Bevis could hear the snap of his beak as he\ncaught the flies.\n\n\"Just a little bit nearer still,\" said he. \"Let me stroke your lovely\nwhite back.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I can't do that. I don't think you are quite safe, Bevis. Why\ndon't you gather the cowslips?\"\n\nBevis looked up and saw that the field was full of cowslips--yellow with\ncowslips. \"I will pick every one,\" said he, \"and carry them all back to\nmy mother.\"\n\n\"You cannot do that,\" said the swallow, laughing, \"you will not try long\nenough.\"\n\n\"I _hate_ you!\" cried Bevis in a passion, and flung his knife, which was\nin his hand, at the bird. The swallow rose up, and the knife whizzed by\nand struck the ground.\n\n\"I told you you were not safe,\" said the swallow over his head; \"and I\nam sure you won't pick half the cowslips.\"\n\nBevis picked up his knife and put it in his pocket; then he began to\ngather the cowslips, and kept on for a quarter of an hour as fast as\never he could, till both hands were full. There was a rustle in the\nhedge, and looking up he saw Pan come out, all brown with sand sticking\nto his coat. He shook himself, and sent the sand flying from him in a\ncloud, just like he did with the water when he came up out of the pond.\nThen he looked at Bevis, wagged his tail, cried \"Yowp!\" and ran back\ninto the hedge again.\n\nBevis rushed to the spot, and saw that there was a large rabbits' hole.\nInto this hole Pan had worked his way so far that there was nothing of\nhim visible but his hind legs and tail. Bevis could hear him panting in\nthe hole, he was working so hard to get at the rabbit, and tearing with\nhis teeth at the roots to make the hole bigger. Bevis clapped his hands,\ndropping his cowslips, and called \"Loo! Loo!\" urging the dog on. The\nsand came flying out behind Pan, and he worked harder and harder, as if\nhe would tear the mound to pieces.\n\nBevis sat down on the grass under the shadow of the oak, by a maple\nbush, and taking a cowslip, began to count the spots inside it. It was\nalways five in all the cowslips--five brown little spots--that he was\nsure of, because he knew he had five fingers on each hand. He lay down\nat full length on his back, and looked up at the sky through the boughs\nof the oak. It was very, very blue, and very near down. With a long\nladder he knew he could have got up there easily, and it looked so\nsweet. \"Sky,\" said Bevis, \"I love you like I love my mother.\" He pouted\nhis lips, and kissed at it. Then turning a little on one side to watch\nPan, in an instant he fell firm asleep.\n\nPan put his head out of the hole to breathe two or three times, and\nlooked aside at Bevis, and seeing that he was still, went back to work\nagain. Two butterflies came fluttering along together. The swallow\nreturned, and flew low down along the grass near Bevis. The wind came\nnow and then, and shook down a shower of white and pink petals from a\ncrab-tree in the hedge. By-and-by a squirrel climbing from tree to tree\nreached the oak, and stayed to look at Bevis beneath in the shadow. He\nknew exactly how Bevis felt--just like he did himself when he went to\nsleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. AT HOME.\n\n\n\"Yowp, yow; wow-wow!\" The yelling of Pan woke Bevis, who jumped up, and\nseeing the bailiff beating the spaniel with a stick, instantly, and\nwithout staying the tenth of a second to rub his eyes or stretch\nhimself, rushed at the man and hit him with his doubled fists. As if he\nhad seen it in his sleep, Bevis understood what was taking place\nimmediately his eyelids opened. So the bailiff beat the dog, and Bevis\nbeat the bailiff. The noise made quite an echo against the thick hedges\nand a high bank that was near. When the bailiff thought he had thrashed\nPan sufficiently, he turned round and looked down at Bevis, whose face\nwas red, and his knuckles sore with striking the bailiff's hard coat.\n\n\"How fess you be, measter,\" said the bailiff (meaning fierce), \"you mind\nas you don't hurt yourself. Look'ee here, there've bin a fine falarie\nabout you, zur.\" He meant that there had been much excitement when it\nwas found that Bevis was not in the garden, and was nowhere to be found.\nEverybody was set to hunt for him.\n\nFirst they thought of the brook, lest he should have walked in among the\nflags that were coming up so green and strong. Then they thought of the\ntallet over the stable,--perhaps he had climbed up there again from the\nmanger, over the heads of the great cart-horses, quietly eating their\nhay, while he put his foot on the manger and then on the projecting\nsteps in the corner, and into the hayrack--and so up. He had done it\nonce before, and could not get down, and so the tallet was searched. One\nman was sent to the Long Pond, with orders to look everywhere, and\nborrow the punt and push in among the bulrushes.\n\nAnother was despatched to the Close, to gruffly inquire where the\ncottage boys were, and what they had been doing, for Bevis was known to\nhanker after their company, to go catching loach under the stones in the\nstream that crossed the road, and creeping under the arch of the bridge,\nand taking the moor-hens' eggs from the banks of the ponds where the\nrushes were thick. Another was put on the pony, to gallop up the road\nafter the carter and his waggon, for he had set off that morning with a\nload of hay for the hills that could be seen to the southward.\n\nRunning over every possible thing that Bevis could have done in his\nmind, his papa remembered that he had lately taken to asking about the\nroad, and would not be satisfied till they had taken him up to the\nsign-post--a mile beyond the village, and explained the meaning of it.\nSome one had told him that it was the road to Southampton--the place\nwhere the ships came. Now, Bevis was full of the ships, drawing them on\nthe blue wall of the summer-house, and floating a boat on the trough in\nthe cow-yard, and looking wistfully up the broad dusty highway, as if\nhe could see the masts and yards sixty miles away or more. Perhaps when\nthe carter went with the waggon that way, Bevis had slipped up the\nfootpath that made a short cut across the fields, and joined the waggon\nat the cross-roads, that he might ride to the hills thinking to see the\nsea on the other side.\n\nAnd the bailiff, not to be behindhand, having just come in for his\nlunch, ran out again without so much as wetting his stubbly white beard\nin the froth of the drawn quart of ale, and made away as fast as his\nstiff legs could carry him to where there was a steam ploughing engine\nat work--a mile distant. The sight of the white steam, and the humming\nof the fly-wheel, always set Bevis \"on the jig,\" as the village folk\ncalled it, to get to the machinery, and the smell of the cotton waste\nand oil wafted on the wind was to him like the scent of battle to the\nwar-horse.\n\nBut Bevis was not in the tallet, nor the brook, nor among the bulrushes\nof the Long Pond, nor under the bridge dabbling for loach, nor watching\nthe steam plough, and the cottage boys swore their hardest (and they\nknew how to swear quite properly) that they had not seen him that\nmorning. But they would look for him, and forthwith eagerly started to\nscour the fields and hedges. Meantime, Bevis, quite happy, was sleeping\nunder the oak in the shadow, with Pan every now and then coming out of\nthe rabbit-hole to snort out the sand that got into his nostrils.\n\nBut, by-and-by, when everything had been done and everybody was\nscattered over the earth seeking for him, the bailiff came back from the\nsteam plough, weary with running, and hungry, thirsty, and cross. As he\npassed through the yard he caught a glimpse of Pan's kennel, which was a\ntub by the wood pile, and saw that the chain was lying stretched to its\nfull length. Pan was gone. At first the bailiff thought Bevis had loosed\nhim, and that he had got a clue. But when he came near, he saw that the\ncollar was not unbuckled; Pan had worked his head out, and so escaped.\n\nThe bailiff turned the collar over thoughtfully with his foot, and felt\nhis scanty white beard with his hard hand; and then he went back to the\ncart-house. Up in the cart-house, on the ledge of the wall beneath the\nthatch, there were three or four sticks, each about four feet long and\nas thick as your thumb, with the bark on--some were ground ash, some\ncrab-tree, and one was hazel. This one was straight and as hard as could\nbe. These sticks were put there for the time when the cows were moved,\nso that the men might find their sticks quick. Each had his stick, and\nthe bailiff's was the hazel one. With the staff in his hand the bailiff\nset out straight across the grass, looking neither to the right nor the\nleft, but walking deliberately and without hesitation.\n\nHe got through a gap in one hedge, and then he turned to the corner\nmaking towards the rabbit-burrows, for he guessed that Pan had gone\nthere. As he approached he saw Bevis sleeping, and smiled, for looking\nfor the dog he had found the boy. But first stepping softly up to Bevis,\nand seeing that he was quite right and unhurt, only asleep, the bailiff\nwent to the hedge and thrust his staff into the hole where Pan was at\nwork.\n\nOut came Pan, and instantly down came the rod. Pan cowered in the grass;\nhe was all over sand, which flew up in a cloud as the rod struck him\nagain. \"Yowp!--yow--wow--wow!\" and this row awoke Bevis.\n\nBevis battled hard for his dog, but the bailiff had had his lunch\ndelayed, and his peace of mind upset about the boy, and he was\nresolutely relieving himself upon the spaniel. Now the hazel rod, being\ndry and stiff, was like a bar of iron, and did not yield or bend in the\nleast, but made the spaniel's ribs rattle. Pan could not get low enough\ninto the grass; he ceased to howl, so great was the pain, but merely\nwhimpered, and the tears filled his brown eyes. At last the bailiff\nceased, and immediately Bevis pulled out his handkerchief, and sat down\non the grass and wiped away the spaniel's tears.\n\n\"Now, measter, you come along wi' I,\" said the bailiff, taking his hand.\nBevis would not come, saying he hated him. But when the bailiff told him\nabout the hunt there had been, and how the people were everywhere\nlooking for him, Bevis began to laugh, thinking it was rare fun.\n\n\"Take me 'pick-a-back,'\" said he.\n\nSo the bailiff stooped and took him. \"Gee-up!\" said Bevis, punching his\nbroad back and kicking him to go faster. Pan, now quite forgotten, crept\nalong behind them.\n\nBevis listened to the lecture they gave him at home with a very bad\ngrace. He sulked and pouted, as if he had himself been the injured\nparty. But no sooner was he released from the dinner-table, than he was\ndown on his knees at his own particular corner cupboard, the one that\nhad been set apart for his toys and things ever since he could walk. It\nwas but a small cupboard, made across the angle of two walls, and with\none shelf only, yet it was bottomless, and always contained something\nnew.\n\nThere were the last fragments of the great box of wooden bricks, cut and\nchipped, and notched and splintered by that treasure, his pocket-knife.\nThere was the tin box for the paste, or the worms in moss, when he went\nfishing. There was the wheel of his old wheelbarrow, long since smashed\nand numbered with the Noah's arks that have gone the usual way. There\nwas the brazen cylinder of a miniature steam-engine bent out of all\nshape. There was the hammer-head made specially for him by the\nblacksmith down in the village, without a handle, for people were tired\nof putting new handles to it, he broke them so quickly. There was a\nhorse-shoe, and the iron catch of a gate, and besides these a boxwood\ntop, which he could not spin, but which he had payed away half the\nsavings in his money-box for, because he had seen it split the other\nboys' tops in the road.\n\nIn one corner was a brass cannon, the touch-hole blackened by the\nexplosion of gunpowder, and by it the lock of an ancient pistol--the\nlock only, and neither barrel nor handle. An old hunting-crop, some\nfeathers from pheasants' tails, part of a mole-trap, an old brazen\nbugle, much battered, a wooden fig-box full of rusty nails, several\nscraps of deal board and stumps of cedar pencil were heaped together in\nconfusion. But these were not all, nor could any written inventory\nexhaust the contents, and give a perfect list of all that cupboard held.\nThere was always something new in it: Bevis never went there, but he\nfound something.\n\nWith the hunting-crop he followed the harriers and chased the doubling\nhare; with the cannon he fought battles, such as he saw in the pictures;\nthe bugle, too, sounded the charge (the bailiff sometimes blew it in the\ngarden to please him, and the hollow \"who-oo!\" it made echoed over the\nfields); with the deal boards and the rusty nails, and the hammer-head,\nhe built houses, and even cities. The jagged and splintered wooden\nbricks, six inches long, were not bricks, but great beams and baulks of\ntimber; the wheel of the wheelbarrow was the centre of many curious\npieces of mechanism. He could see these things easily. So he sat down at\nhis cupboard and forgot the lecture instantly; the pout disappeared from\nhis lips as he plunged his hand into the inexhaustible cupboard.\n\n\"Bevis, dear,\" he heard presently, \"you may have an apple.\"\n\nInstantly, and without staying to shut the door on his treasures, he\ndarted upstairs--up two flights, with a clatter and a bang, burst open\nthe door, and was in the apple-room. It was a large garret or attic,\nrunning half the length of the house, and there, in the autumn, the best\napples from the orchard were carried, and put on a thin layer of hay,\neach apple apart from its fellow (for they ought not to touch), and each\nparticular sort, the Blenheim Oranges and the King Pippins, the Creepers\nand the Grindstone Pippins (which grew nowhere else), divided from the\nnext sort by a little fence of hay.\n\nThe most of them were gone now, only a few of the keeping apples\nremained, and from these Bevis, with great deliberation, chose the\nbiggest, measuring them by the eye and weighing them in his hand. Then\ndownstairs again with a clatter and a bang, down the second stairs this\ntime, past the gun-room, where the tools were kept, and a carpenter's\nbench; then through the whole length of the ground floor from the\nkitchen to the parlour slamming every door behind him, and kicking over\nthe chairs in front of him.\n\nThere he stayed half-a-minute to look at the hornet's nest under the\nglass-case on the mantelpiece. The comb was built round a central pillar\nor column, three stories one above the other, and it had been taken from\nthe willow tree by the brook, the huge hollow willow which he had twice\ntried to chop down, that he might make a boat of it. Then out of doors,\nand up the yard, and past the cart-house, when something moved in the\nlong grass under the wall. It was a weasel, caught in a gin.\n\nThe trap had been set by the side of a drain for rats, and the weasel\ncoming out, or perhaps frightened by footsteps, and hastening\ncarelessly, had been trapped. Bevis, biting his apple, looked at the\nweasel, and the weasel said: \"Sir Bevis, please let me out, this gin\nhurts me so; the teeth are very sharp and the spring is very strong, and\nthe tar-cord is very stout, so that I cannot break it. See how the iron\nhas skinned my leg and taken off the fur, and I am in such pain. Do\nplease let me go, before the ploughboy comes, or he will hit me with a\nstick, or smash me with a stone, or put his iron-shod heel on me; and I\nhave been a very good weasel, Bevis. I have been catching the horrid\nrats that eat the barley-meal put for the pigs. Oh, let me out, the gin\nhurts me so!\"\n\nBevis put his foot on the spring, and was pressing it down, and the\nweasel thought he was already free, and looked across at the wood pile\nunder which he meant to hide, when Bevis heard a little squeak close to\nhis head, and looked up and saw a mouse under the eaves of the\ncart-house, peeping forth from a tiny crevice, where the mortar had\nfallen from between the stones of the wall.\n\n\"Bevis, Bevis!\" said the mouse, \"don't you do it--don't you let that\nweasel go! He is a most dreadful wicked weasel, and his teeth are ever\nso much sharper than that gin. He does not kill the rats, because he is\nafraid of them (unless he can assassinate one in his sleep), but he\nmurdered my wife and sucked her blood, and her body, all dry and\nwithered, is up in the beam there, if you will get a ladder and look.\nAnd he killed all my little mouses, and made me very unhappy, and I\nshall never be able to get another wife to live with me in this\ncart-house while he is about. There is no way we can get away from him.\nIf we go out into the field he follows us there, and if we go into the\nsheds he comes after us there, and he is a cruel beast, that wicked\nweasel. You know you ate the partridge's eggs,\" added the mouse,\nspeaking to the weasel.\n\n\"It is all false,\" said the weasel. \"But it is true that you ate the\nwheat out of the ears in the wheat-rick, and you know what was the\nconsequence. If that little bit of wheat you ate had been thrashed, and\nground, and baked, and made into bread, then that poor girl would have\nhad a crust to eat, and would not have jumped into the river, and she\nwould have had a son, and he would have been a great man and fought\nbattles, just as Bevis does with his brazen cannon, and won great\nvictories, and been the pride of all the nation. But you ate those\nparticular grains of wheat that were meant to do all this, you wicked\nlittle mouse. Besides which, you ran across the bed one night, and\nfrightened Bevis's mother.\"\n\n\"But I did not mean to,\" said the mouse; \"and you did mean to kill my\nwife, and you ate the partridge's eggs.\"\n\n\"And a very good thing I did,\" said the weasel. \"Do you know what would\nhave happened, if I had not taken them? I did it all for good, and with\nthe best intentions. For if I had left the eggs one more day, there was\na man who meant to have stolen them all but one, which he meant to have\nleft to deceive the keeper. If he had stolen them, he would have been\ncaught, for the keeper was watching for him all the time, and he would\nhave been put to prison, and his children would have been hungry. So I\nate the eggs, and especially I ate every bit of the one the man meant to\nhave left.\"\n\n\"And why were you so particular about eating that egg?\" asked Bevis.\n\n\"Because,\" said the weasel, \"if that egg had come to a partridge chick,\nand the chick had lived till the shooting-time came, then the sportsman\nand his brother, when they came round, would have started it out of the\nstubble, and the shot from the gun of the younger would have\naccidentally killed the elder, and people would have thought it was done\nto murder him for the sake of the inheritance.\"\n\n\"Now, is this true?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Yes, that it is; and I killed the mouse's wife also for the best of\nreasons.\"\n\n\"You horrid wretch!\" cried the mouse.\n\n\"Oh, you needn't call me a wretch,\" said the weasel; \"I am sure you\nought to be grateful to me, for your wife was very jealous because you\npaid so much attention to the Miss Mouse you want to marry now, and in\nthe night she meant to have gnawn your throat.\"\n\n\"And you frightened my mother,\" said Bevis, \"by running across her bed\nin the night;\" and he began to press on the spring of the gin.\n\n\"Yes, that he did,\" said the weasel, overjoyed; \"and he made a hole in\nthe boards of the floor, and it was down that hole that the\nhalf-sovereign rolled and was lost, and the poor maid-servant sent away\nbecause they thought she had stolen it.\"\n\n\"What do you say to that?\" asked Bevis.\n\nBut the mouse was quite aghast and dumb-founded and began to think that\nit was he after all who was in the wrong, so that for the moment he\ncould not speak. Just then Bevis caught sight of the colt that had come\nup beside his mother, the cart mare, to the fence; and thinking that he\nwould go and try and stroke the pretty creature, Bevis started forward,\nforgetting all about the weasel and the mouse. As he started, he pressed\nthe spring down, and in an instant the weasel was out, and had hobbled\nacross to the wood pile. When the mouse saw this, he gave a little\nsqueak of terror, and ran back to his hiding-place.\n\nBut when Bevis put out his hand to stroke the colt, the colt started\nback, so he picked up a stick and threw it at him. Then he took another\nstick and hunted the hens round and round the ricks to make them lay\ntheir eggs faster, as it is well known that is the best way. For he\nremembered that last year they had shown him three tiny bantam chicks,\nsuch darling little things, all cuddled cosily together in the hollow of\na silver table-spoon. The hens clucked and raced, and Bevis raced after\nand shouted, and the cock, slipping on one side, for it hurt his\ndignity to run away like the rest, hopped upon the railings, napped his\nwings, crew, and cried: \"You'll be glad when I'm dead\". That was how\nBevis translated his \"hurra-ca-roorah\".\n\nIn the midst of the noise out came Polly, the dairy-maid, with a bone\nfor Pan, which Bevis no sooner saw, than he asked her to let him give\nPan his dinner. \"Very well, dear,\" said Polly, and went in to finish her\nwork. So Bevis took the bone, and Pan, all weary and sore from his\nthrashing, crept out from his tub to receive it; but Bevis put the bone\non the grass (all the grass was worn bare where Pan could reach) just\nwhere the spaniel could smell it nicely but could not get it. Pan\nstruggled, and scratched, and howled, and scratched again, and tugged\ntill his collar, buckled tightly now, choked him, and he gasped and\npanted, while Bevis, taking the remnant of his apple from his pocket,\nnibbled it and laughed with a face like an angel's for sweetness.\n\nThen a rook went over and cawed, and Bevis, looking up at the bird,\ncaught a glimpse of the swing over the wall--it stood under the sycamore\ntree. Dropping the bit of apple, away he ran to the swing, and sat in\nit, and pushed himself off. As he swung forward he straightened his legs\nand leant back; when he swung back he drew his feet under him and leant\nforward, and by continuing this the weight of his body caused the swing\nto rise like a pendulum till he went up among the sycamore boughs,\nnearly as high as the ivy-grown roof of the summer-house, just\nopposite. There he went to and fro, as easily as possible, shutting his\neyes and humming to himself.\n\nPresently a cock chaffinch came and perched in the ash close by, and\nimmediately began to sing his war-song: \"I am lord of this tree,\" sang\nthe chaffinch, \"I am lord of this tree; every bough is mine, and every\nleaf, and the wind that comes through it, and the sunshine that falls on\nit, and the rain that moistens it, and the blue sky over it, and the\ngrass underneath it--all this is mine. My nest is going to be made in\nthe ivy that grows half-way up the trunk, and my wife is very busy\nto-day bringing home the fibres and the moss, and I have just come back\na little while to tell you all that none of you must come into or touch\nmy tree. I like this tree, and therefore it is mine. Be careful that\nnone of you come inside the shadow of it, or I shall peck you with all\nmy might.\"\n\nThen he paused awhile, and Bevis went on swinging and listening. In a\nminute or two another chaffinch came to the elm in the hedge just\noutside the garden, and quite close to the ash. Directly he perched, he\nruffled up and began to sing too: \"I am lord of this tree, and it is a\nvery high tree, much higher than the ash, and even above the oak where\nthat slow fellow the crow is building. Mine is the very highest tree of\nall, and I am the brightest and prettiest of all the chaffinches. See my\ncolours how bright they are, so that you would hardly know me from a\nbullfinch. There is not a feather rumpled in my wing, or my tail, and I\nhave the most beautiful eyes of all of you.\"\n\nHardly had he done singing than another chaffinch came into the\ncrab-tree, a short way up the hedge, and he began to sing too: \"I have a\nmuch bigger tree than either of you, but as it is at the top of the\nfield I cannot bring it down here, but I have come down into this\ncrab-tree, and I say it is mine, and I am lord of two trees. I am\nstronger than both of you, and neither of you dare come near me.\"\n\nThe two other chaffinches were silent for a minute, and then one of\nthem, the knight of the ash-tree, flew down into the hedge under the\ncrab-tree; and instantly down flew the third chaffinch, and they fought\na battle, and pecked and buffeted one another with their wings, till\nBevis's tears ran down with laughing. Presently they parted, and the\nthird chaffinch went home to his tree at the top of the field, leaving\none little feather on the ground, which the first chaffinch picked up\nand carried to his nest in the ash.\n\nBut scarcely had he woven it into the nest than down flew the second\nchaffinch from the elm into the shadow of the ash. Flutter, flutter went\nthe first chaffinch to meet him, and they had such a battle as Bevis had\nnever seen before, and fought till they were tired; then each flew up\ninto his tree, and sang again about their valour.\n\nImmediately afterwards ten sparrows came from the house-top into the\nbushes, chattering and struggling all together, scratching, pecking,\nbuffeting, and all talking at once. After they had had a good fight\nthey all went back to the house-top, and began to tell each other what\ntremendous blows they had given. Then there was such a great cawing from\nthe rook trees, which were a long way off, that it was evident a battle\nwas going on there, and Bevis heard the chaffinch say that one of the\nrooks had been caught stealing his cousin's sticks.\n\nNext two goldfinches began to fight, and then a blackbird came up from\nthe brook and perched on a rail, and he was such a boaster, for he said\nhe had the yellowest bill of all the blackbirds, and the blackest coat,\nand the largest eye, and the sweetest whistle, and he was lord over all\nthe blackbirds. In two minutes up came another one from out of the\nbramble bushes at the corner, and away they went chattering at each\nother. Presently the starlings on the chimney began to quarrel, and had\na terrible set-to. Then a wren came by, and though he was so small, his\nboast was worse than the blackbird's, for he said he was the sharpest\nand the cleverest of all the birds, and knew more than all put together.\n\nAfar off, in the trees, there were six or seven thrushes, all declaring\nthat they were the best singers, and had the most speckled necks; and up\nin the sky the swallows were saying that they had the whitest bosoms.\n\n\"Oo! whoo,\" cried a wood-pigeon from the very oak under which Bevis had\ngone to sleep. \"There are none who can fly so fast as I can. I am a\ncaptain of the wood-pigeons, and in the winter I have three hundred and\ntwenty-two pigeons under me, and they all do exactly as I tell them.\nThey fly when I fly, and settle down when I settle down. If I go to the\nwest, they go to the west; and if I go to the east, then they follow to\nthe east. I have the biggest acorns, and the best of the peas, for they\nleave them especially for me. And not one of all the three hundred and\ntwenty-two pigeons dares to begin to eat the wheat in August till I say\nit is ripe and they may, and not one of them dares to take a wife till I\nsay yes. Oo-whoo! Is not my voice sweet and soft, and delicious, far\nsweeter than that screeching nightingale's in the hawthorn yonder?\"\n\nBut he had no sooner finished than another one began in the fir copse,\nand said he was captain of one thousand pigeons, and was ever so much\nstronger, and could fly ten miles an hour faster. So away went the first\npigeon to the fir copse, and there was a great clattering of wings and\n\"oo-whoo\"-ing, and how it was settled Bevis could not tell.\n\nSo as he went on swinging, he heard all the birds quarrelling, and\nboasting, and fighting, hundreds of them all around, and he said to the\nchaffinch on the ash:--\n\n\"Chaffinch, it seems to me that you are all very wicked birds, for you\nthink of nothing but fighting all day long\".\n\nThe chaffinch laughed, and said: \"My dear Sir Bevis, I do not know what\nyou mean by wicked. But fighting is very nice indeed, and we all feel\nso jolly when fighting time comes. For you must know that the spring is\nthe duelling time, when all the birds go to battle. There is not a tree\nnor a bush on your papa's farm, nor on all the farms all around, nor in\nall the country, nor in all this island, but some fighting is going on.\nI have not time to tell you all about it; but I wish you could read our\nhistory, and all about the wars that have been going on these thousand\nyears. Perhaps if you should ever meet the squirrel he will tell you,\nfor he knows most about history. As we all like it so much, it must be\nright, and we never hurt one another very much. Sometimes a feather is\nknocked out, and sometimes one gets a hard peck; but it does not do any\nharm. And after it is over, in the autumn, we are all very good friends,\nand go hunting together. You may see us, hundreds of us in your papa's\nstubble-fields, Bevis, all flying together very happy. I think the\nskylarks fight the most, for they begin almost in the winter if the sun\nshines warm for an hour, and they keep on all day in the summer, and\ntill it is quite dark and the stars are out, besides getting up before\nthe cuckoo to go on again. Yet they are the sweetest and nicest of all\nthe birds, and the most gentle, and do not mind our coming into their\nfields. So I am sure, Bevis, that you are wrong, and fighting is not\nwicked if you love one another. You and Mark are fond of one another,\nbut you hit him sometimes, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I do,\" said Bevis, very eagerly, \"I hit him yesterday so\nhard with my bat that he would not come and play with me. It is very\nnice to hit any one.\"\n\n\"But you cannot do it like we do it,\" said the chaffinch, swelling with\npride again, \"for we sing and you can't, and if you can't sing you have\nno business to fight, and besides, though you are much older than me you\nare not married yet. Now I have such a beautiful wife, and to tell you\nthe truth, Bevis, we do the fighting because the ladies love to see it,\nand kiss us for it afterwards. I am the knight of this tree!\"\n\nAfter which Bevis, being tired of swinging, went to the summer-house to\nread what he had written with his stump of pencil till he was called to\ntea. In the evening, when the sun was sinking, he went out and lay down\non the seat--it was a broad plank, grey with lichen--under the russet\napple-tree, looking towards the west, over the brook below. He saw the\nbees coming home to the hives close by on the haha, and they seemed to\ncome high in the air, flying straight as if from the distant hills where\nthe sun was. He heard the bees say that there were such quantities of\nflowers on the hills, and such pleasant places, and that the sky was\nmuch more blue up there, and he thought if he could he would go to the\nhills soon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. ADVENTURES OF THE WEASEL.\n\n\nAfter awhile the mowers came and began to cut the long grass in the Home\nField, and the meadow by the brook. Bevis could see them from the\ngarden, and it was impossible to prevent him from straying up the\nfootpath, so eager was he to go nearer. The best thing that could be\ndone, since he could not be altogether stopped, was to make him promise\nthat he would not go beyond a certain limit. He might wander as much as\nhe pleased inside the hedge and the Home Field, in which there was no\npond, nor any place where he could very well come to harm. But he must\nnot creep through the hedge, so that he would always be in sight from\nthe garden. If he wished to enter the meadow by the brook he must ask\nspecial permission, that some one might be put to watch now and then.\n\nBut more expressly he was forbidden to enter the Little Field. The grass\nthere was not yet to be mown--it was too long to walk in--and they were\nafraid lest he should get through the hedge, or climb over the high\npadlocked gate in some way or other, for the Long Pond was on the other\nside, though it could not be seen for trees. Nor was he to approach\nnearer to the mowers than one swathe; he was always to keep one swathe\nbetween him and the scythes, which are extremely sharp and dangerous\ninstruments.\n\nSir Bevis repeated these promises so seriously, and with so demure and\ninnocent an expression, that no one could doubt but that he would keep\nthem strictly, nor, indeed, did any idea of exceeding these limits occur\nto him. He was so overjoyed at the vast extent of territory, almost a\nnew world thrown open for exploration, that he did not think it possible\nhe could ever want to go any farther. He rushed into the Home Field,\njumping over the swathes till he was tired, and kicking the grass about\nwith his feet. Then he wanted a prong, and a stout stick with a fork was\ncut and pointed for him, and with this he went eagerly to work for five\nminutes. Next he wanted some one to bury under the grass, and could not\nbe satisfied till the dairy-maid was sent out and submitted to be\ncompletely hidden under a heap of it.\n\nNext he walked all round the field, and back home down the middle.\nBy-and-by he sat down and looked at the mowers, who were just finishing\nthe last corner before they went into the meadow by the brook. While he\nwas sitting there a number of greenfinches, and sparrows, and two or\nthree hasty starlings (for they are always in a hurry), came to the\nsward where the mowers had just passed, and searched about for food.\nThey seemed so happy and looked so pretty, Bevis thought he should like\nto shoot one, so away he ran home to the summer-house for his bow and\narrow. Hastening back with these, he built a heap of the grass to hide\nbehind, like a breastwork, and then sat down and watched for the birds.\n\nThey did not come directly, as they ought to have done, so he kicked up\nhis heels, and rolled over on his back, and looked up at the sky, as was\nhis wont. Every now and then he could hear Pan whining woefully in his\ntub a long way off. Since the whipping the spaniel had been in disgrace,\nand no one would let him loose. Bevis, so delighted with his field to\nroam about in, quite forgot him, and left him to sorrow in his tub.\nPresently he heard a lark singing so sweetly, though at a great\ndistance, that he kept quite still to listen. The song came in verses,\nnow it rose a little louder, and now it fell till he could hardly hear\nit, and again returned. Bevis got up on his knees to try and find where\nthe lark was, but the sky was so blue there or the bird so high up, he\ncould not see it, though he searched and searched. It was somewhere in\nthe next field, far beyond the great oak where he once fell asleep.\n\nHe then peered round his heap of grass, but there were no greenfinches\nnear; they had come out from the hedges, and the starling had come from\nthe hollow pollard where he had a nest, but all had settled a long way\noff from his hiding-place. Bevis was very angry, so he stood up, and\npulled his bow with all his might, and let the arrow fly into the air\nalmost straight up. When it had risen so far, it turned over and came\ndown among the flock of birds and stuck in the ground.\n\nThey flew away in terror, and though he had not killed any, Bevis was\nhighly delighted at the fright they were in. He picked up his arrow,\nand tried another long shot at a rook on the other side of the field,\nbut he could not send it so great a distance. As he ran for it, he saw\nthat the rook's back was towards him, and, thinking that the rook could\nnot see him, he raced on quietly to try and catch him, but just as he\ngot close, up rose the rook over the hedge with a \"Caw, caw!\" Whizz!\nwent Bevis's arrow after him, and fell on the other side of the hedge,\nwhere he was not to go.\n\nIn his anger at the rook's behaviour Bevis forgot all about his promise;\nhe jumped into the ditch regardless of the stinging-nettles, pushed his\nway up through the briars, tearing his sleeve, forced his way across the\nmound, and went on his hands and knees through the young green fern on\nthe other side (just as Pan would have done) under the thick thorn\nbushes, and so out into the next field. It was the very field where he\nand Pan had wandered before, only another part of it. There was his\narrow ever so far off, sticking upright in the grass among the cowslips.\nAs he went to pick up his arrow he saw another flower growing a little\nfarther on, and went to gather that first; it was an orchid, and when he\nstood up with it in his hand he heard a mouse rustle in the grass, and\nstepped quietly to try and see it, but the mouse hid in a hole.\n\nThen there was an enormous humble-bee, so huge that when it stayed to\nsuck a cowslip, the cowslip was bent down with its weight. Bevis walked\nafter the giant humble-bee, and watched it take the honey from several\ncowslips; then he saw a stone standing in the field, it was not\nupright, but leaned to one side--yet it was almost as tall as he was. He\nwent to the stone and looked all round it, and got up on it and sat\nstill a minute, and while he was there a cuckoo came by, so close, that\nhe jumped off to run after it. But the cuckoo flew fast, and began to\ncall \"Cuckoo!\" and it was no use to chase him.\n\nWhen Bevis stopped and looked about he was in a hollow, like a big salad\nbowl, only all grass, and he could see nothing but the grass and\ncowslips all round him--no hedges--and the sky overhead. He began to\ndance and sing with delight at such a curious place, and when he paused\nthe lark was on again, and not very far this time. There he was, rising\ngradually, singing as he went. Bevis ran up the side of the hollow\ntowards the lark, and saw a hedge cut and cropped low, and over it a\nwheat-field. He watched the lark sing, sing, sing, up into the sky, and\nthen he thought he would go and find his nest, as he remembered the\nploughboy had told him larks made their nests on the ground among the\ncorn.\n\nHe ran to the low hedge, but though it was low it was very thorny, and\nwhile he was trying to find a place to get through, he looked over and\nspied a hare crouched in the rough grass, just under the hedge between\nit and the wheat. The hare was lying on the ground; she did not move,\nthough she saw Bevis, and when he looked closer he saw that her big eyes\nwere full of tears. She was crying very bitterly, all by herself, while\nthe sun was shining so brightly, and the wind blowing so sweetly, and\nthe flowers smelling so pleasantly, and the lark sing, sing, singing\noverhead.\n\n\"Oh! dear,\" said Bevis, so eager and so sorry, that he pushed against\nthe hedge, and did not notice that a thorn was pricking his arm:\n\"Whatever is the matter?\" But the hare was so miserable she would not\nanswer him at first, till he coaxed her nicely. Then she said: \"Bevis,\nBevis, little Sir Bevis, do you know what you have done?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bevis, \"I can't think: was it me?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was you; you let the weasel loose, when he was caught in the\ngin.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" said Bevis, \"I have quite forgotten it.\"\n\n\"But you did it,\" said the hare, \"and now the weasel has killed my son,\nthe leveret, while he was sleeping, and sucked his blood, and I am so\nmiserable; I do not care to run away any more.\" Then the hare began to\nweep bitterly again, till Bevis did not know what to do to comfort her.\n\n\"Perhaps the weasel only killed the leveret for your good,\" he said\npresently.\n\n\"What!\" cried the hare, putting her fore-feet down hard, and stamping\nwith indignation. \"That is what the wicked old wretch told you, did he\nnot, about the mouse and the partridge's eggs. Cannot you see that it is\nall a pack of lies? But I do not wonder that he deceives you, dear,\nsince he has deceived the world for so long. Let me tell you, Sir Bevis,\nthe weasel is the wickedest and most dreadful creature that lives, and\nabove all things he is so cunning he can make people believe anything\nhe chooses, and he has succeeded in making fools of us all--every one.\n\n\"There is not one of all the animals in the hedge, nor one of the birds\nin the trees, that he has not cheated. He is so very, very cunning, and\nhis talk is so soft and smooth. Do you please take care, Sir Bevis, or\nperhaps he may deceive you, as he deceived the fox. Why, do you know, he\nhas made the people believe that his crimes are committed by the fox,\nwho consequently bears all the disgrace; and not only that, but he has\nspread it abroad that the fox is the most cunning of all, in order that\nhe may not be suspected of being so clever as he is. I daresay the\nweasel will have me some day, and I do not care if he does, now my\nleveret is dead; and very soon his poor bones will be picked clean by\nthe ants, and after the corn is carried the plough will bury them.\"\n\nBevis was terribly distressed at the hare's story, and showed such\nindignation against the weasel, and stamped his little foot so hard,\nknitting his brow, that the hare was somewhat appeased, and began to\nexplain all about it.\n\n\"Of course you did not know, dear,\" she said, \"when you stepped on the\nspring of the gin, what trouble we had had to get him into the trap. For\nwe had all suffered so long from his cruelty, that we had all agreed at\nlast to try and put an end to it. The trees could not bear to stand\nstill and see it go on under them, yet they could not move. The earth\ncould not bear to feel him running about on his bloodthirsty business,\nthrough the holes the rabbits had made. The grass hated to feel him\npushing through, for it had so often been stained with the blood that he\nhad shed. So we all took counsel together, and I carried the messages,\ndear, from the oak, where you slept, to the ash and the elm, and to the\nearth in the corner where the rabbits live; and the birds came up into\nthe oak and gave their adherence, every one; and the fox, too, though he\ndid not come himself, for he is too cunning to commit himself till he\nknows which way the wind is going to blow, sent word of his high\napproval.\n\n\"Thus we were all prepared to act against that midnight assassin, the\nweasel, but we could not begin. The trees could not move, the earth\ncould not wag a step, the grass could do nothing, and so it went on for\nsome months, during all which time the weasel was busy with his\nwickedness, till at last the bailiff set the gin for the rat by the\ncart-house. Then the fox came out by day--contrary to his custom, for he\nlikes a nap--and went to a spot where he knew a rabbit sat in the grass;\nand he hunted the poor rabbit (it was very good sport to see--I do not\nlike rabbits), till he had driven him across the ditch, where the weasel\nwas. Then the fox stopped, and hid himself in the furze; and the weasel,\nfirst looking round to see that no one was near, stole after the rabbit.\nNow the rabbit knew that the fox was about, and therefore he was afraid\nto run across the open field; all he could do was to go down the hedge\ntowards the garden.\n\n\"Everything was going on well, and we sent word to the rat, to warn him\nagainst the gin--we did not like the rat, but we did not want the gin\nthrown--don't you see, dear? But when the rabbit had gone half-way down\nthe hedge, and was close to the garden, he became afraid to venture any\nnearer your house, Bevis. Still the weasel crept after him, and\npresently drove him almost up to your sycamore-tree. Then the rabbit did\nnot know what to do; for if he went forward the people in the house\nmight see him and bring out the gun, and if he turned back the weasel\nwould have him, and if he ran out into the field the fox would be there,\nand he could not climb up a tree. He stopped still, trying to think,\ntill the weasel came so near he could smell the rabbit's blood, and\nthen, in his terror, the rabbit darted out from the hedge, and into the\nditch of your haha wall, under where the bee-hives are. There he saw a\ndry drain, and hopped into it, forgetting in his fright that he might\nnot be able to get out at the other end.\n\n\"The weasel thought he had now got him safe, and was just going to rush\nacross and follow, when an ant spoke to him from the trunk of a tree it\nwas climbing. The ant said the fox had asked him yesterday to watch, and\nif the weasel came that way, to warn him that there was a plot laid for\nhis life, and not to be too venturesome. This was a piece of the same\ndouble-faced ways the fox has been notorious for these many years past.\nNo one hates the weasel so much as the fox, but he said to himself: 'The\nweasel is so cunning, that even if he is caught, he is sure to find some\nway to get free, and then he will perhaps discover that I had a hand in\nit, and will turn round on me and spoil some of my schemes out of spite.\nBesides which, I don't see why I should take much interest in the hare\nor the mouse.' So, though he hunted the rabbit for us, yet he sent the\nweasel this message, to take care and mind and not be too bold.\n\n\"When the weasel heard this he stopped, and thought to himself that it\nwas rather dangerous to go so near a house, almost under it; and yet he\ncould not help licking his mouth, as he remembered the sweet scent of\nthe rabbit's blood. But he was so very, very cunning, that he thought to\nhimself the rabbit would be obliged to come out again presently, and\nwould be sure to come up the hedge if he did not see the weasel. So the\nweasel turned round to go up the hedge, and we were all in anxiety lest\nthe scheme should miscarry. But as the weasel was going under the elm,\nthe elm dropped a large dead branch, and as it came crashing down, it\nfell so near the weasel as to pinch his foot, and, hearing another\nbranch go crack, he lost his presence of mind, turned back again, and\ndarted across the corner into the drain. There the scent of the rabbit\nwas so strong he could not help but follow it, and in a moment or two he\nsaw the poor creature crouched at the end where he could not pass.\n\n\"The weasel bounded forward, when the earth squeezed out a stone, and\nthe stone fell between the weasel and the rabbit. Before he could tell\nwhat to do, the earth squeezed out another stone behind him and he was\ncaught, and could neither go forward or backward. Now we thought we had\ngot him, and that he must starve to death. As for the rabbit, when the\nstone fell down it left a hole above, up which he scrambled into the\ncow-yard, and there hid himself behind a bunch of nettles till night,\nwhen he escaped into the field.\n\n\"Meantime the weasel in a dreadful fright was walking to and fro in his\nnarrow prison, gnashing his teeth with rage and terror, and calling to\nall the animals and birds and insects and even to the mole (whom he\ndespised most of all) to help him out. He promised to be the nicest,\nkindest weasel that ever was known; but it was no use, for they were all\nin the secret, and overjoyed to see him on the point of perishing. There\nhe had to stay, and though he scratched and scratched, he could not make\nany hole through the solid stone, and by-and-by he got weaker, and he\nbegan to die. While he was dying the rat came and peeped down at him\nthrough a chink, and laughed and said: 'What is the use of all your\ncunning, you coward? If you had been bold like me you would never have\ngot into this scrape, by being afraid of a dead branch of a tree because\nit pinched your foot. I should have run by quickly. You are a silly,\nfoolish, blind sort of creature; could you not see that all the things\nhad agreed to deceive you?'\n\n\"At this the weasel was so wroth it woke him up from his dying, and he\nreturned the taunt and said: 'Rat, you are by far the silliest to help\nthe hare and the mouse; it is true they sent you a message about the\ngin, but that was not for love of you, I am sure, and I can't think why\nthey should send it; but you may depend it is some trick, and very\nlikely the gin is not where they said at all, but in another place, and\nyou will walk into it when you are not thinking, and then you will curse\nthe hare and the mouse'.\n\n\"'Ah,' said the rat, 'that sounds like reason; you are right, the hare\nand the mouse are going to play me a trick. But I will spite them, I\nwill let you out.'\n\n\"'Will you?' said the weasel, starting up and feeling almost strong\nagain. 'But you can't, these stones are so thick you cannot move them,\nnor scratch through them, nor raise them; no, you cannot let me out.'\n\n\"'Oh, yes, I can,' said the rat, 'I know a way to move the biggest\nstones, and if you can only wait a day or two I will make this chink\nlarge enough for you to come up.'\n\n\"'A day or two,' said the weasel in despair; 'why, I am nearly dead now\nwith hunger.'\n\n\"'Well then,' said the rat, 'gnaw your own tail;' and off he went\nlaughing at the joke. The miserable weasel cried and sniffed, and\nsniffed and cried, till by-and-by he heard the rat come back and begin\nto scratch outside. Presently the rat stopped, and was going away again,\nwhen the weasel begged and prayed him not to leave him to die there in\nthe dark.\n\n\"'Very well,' said the rat, 'I will send the cricket to sing to you. In\na day or two you will see the chink get bigger, and meantime you can\neat your tail; and as you will get very thin, you will be able to creep\nthrough a very small hole and get out all the quicker. Ha! ha! As for\nme, I am going to have a capital dinner from Pan's dish, for he has\nfallen asleep in his tub.'\n\n\"So the weasel was left to himself, and though he watched and watched,\nhe could not see the chink open in the least, and he got so dreadfully\nhungry that at last, after sucking his paws, he was obliged to bring his\ntail round and begin to gnaw it a little bit. The pain was dreadful, but\nhe could not help himself, he was obliged to do it or die. In the\nevening the cricket came, as the rat had promised, to the top of the\nchink, and at once began to sing. He sang all about the lady cricket\nwith whom he was in love, and then about the beautiful stars that were\nshining in the sky, and how nice it was to be a cricket, for the\ncrickets were by far the most handsome and clever of all creatures, and\neverybody would like to be a cricket if they could.\n\n\"Next, he went on to praise himself, that his lady might hear what fine\nlimbs he had, and so noble a form, and such a splendid chink to live in.\nThus he kept on the livelong night, and all about himself; and his\nchirp, chirp, chirp filled the weasel's prison with such a noise that\nthe wretched thing could not sleep. He kept asking the cricket to tell\nhim if the rat had really done anything to enlarge the chink; but the\ncricket was too busy to answer him till the dawn, and then, having\nfinished his song, he found time to attend to the weasel.\n\n\"'You have been very rude,' he said, 'to keep on talking while I was\nsinging, but I suppose, as you are only an ignorant weasel, you do not\nunderstand good manners, and therefore I will condescend so far as to\ninform you of the measures taken by my noble friend the rat to get you\nout. If you were not so extremely ignorant and stupid you would guess\nwhat he has done.'\n\n\"Now all this was very bitter to the weasel, who had always thought he\nknew everything, to be insulted by a cricket; still he begged to be told\nwhat it was. 'The rat,' went on the cricket, 'has brought a little piece\nfrom a fungus, and has scratched a hole beside the stone and put it in\nthere. Now, when this begins to grow and the fungus pushes up, it will\nmove the stone and open a chink. In this way I have seen my lord the rat\nheave up the heaviest paving stones and make a road for himself. Now are\nyou not stupid?' Then the cricket went home to bed.\n\n\"All day long the miserable weasel lay on the floor of his prison,\ndriven every now and then to gnaw his tail till he squeaked with the\npain. The only thing that kept him from despair was the hope of the\nrevenge he would have, if ever he did get out, on those who had laid the\ntrap for him. For hours he lay insensible, and only woke up when the rat\nlooked down the chink and asked him, with a jolly chuckle, how his tail\ntasted, and then went off without waiting for an answer. Then the\ncricket came again, and taking not the least notice of the prisoner,\nsang all night.\n\n\"In the morning the weasel looked up, and saw that the chink had really\nopened. He crawled to it, he was so faint he could not walk, so he had\nto crawl over the floor, which was all red with his own blood. The\nfungus, a thick, yellowish-green thing, like a very large and\nunwholesome mushroom, was growing fast, so fast he could see it move,\nand very slowly it shoved and lifted up the stone. The chink was now so\nfar open that in his thin, emaciated state, the weasel could have got\nthrough; but he was so weak he could not climb up. He called to the rat,\nand the rat came and tried to reach him, but it was just a little too\nfar down.\n\n\"'If I only had something to drink,' said the weasel, 'only one drop of\nwater, I think I could do it, but I am faint from thirst.'\n\n\"Off ran the rat to see what he could do, and as he passed the tub where\nPan lived he saw a bowl of water just pumped for the spaniel. The bowl\nwas of wood with a projecting handle--not a ring to put the fingers\nthrough, but merely a short straight handle. He went round to the other\nside of the tub in which Pan was dozing and began to scratch. Directly\nPan heard the scratching:--\n\n\"'Ho! ho!' said he, 'that's that abominable rat that steals my food,'\nand he darted out, and in his tremendous hurry his chain caught the\nhandle of the bowl, just as the rat had hoped it would. Over went the\nbowl, and all the water was spilt, but the rat, the instant he heard Pan\ncoming, had slipped away back to the weasel.\n\n\"When Pan was tired of looking where he had heard the scratching, he\nwent back to take a lap, but found the bowl upset, and that all the\nwater had run down the drain. As he was very thirsty after gnawing a\nsalt bacon-bone, he set up a barking, and the dairy-maid ran out,\nthinking it was a beggar, and began to abuse him for being so clumsy as\nto knock over his bowl. Pan barked all the louder, so she hit him with\nthe handle of her broom, and he went howling into his tub. He vowed\nvengeance against the rat, but that did not satisfy his thirst.\n\n\"Meantime the water had run along the drain, and though the fungus\ngreedily sucked up most of it, the weasel had a good drink. After that\nhe felt better, and he climbed up the chink, squeezing through and\ndragging his raw tail behind him, till he nearly reached the top. But\nthere it was still a little tight, and he could not manage to push\nthrough, not having strength enough left. He felt himself slipping back\nagain, and called on the rat to save him. The rat without ceremony leant\ndown the chink, and caught hold of his ear with his teeth, and snipped\nit so tight he bit it right through, but he dragged the weasel out.\n\n\"There he lay a long time half dead and exhausted, under a dock leaf\nwhich hid him from view. The rat began to think that the weasel would\ndie after all, so he came and said: 'Wake up, coward, and come with me\ninto the cart-house; there is a very nice warm hole there, and I will\ntell you something; if you stay here very likely the bailiff may see\nyou, and if Pan should be let loose he will sniff you out in a second'.\nSo the weasel, with very great difficulty, dragged himself into the\ncart-house, and found shelter in the hole.\n\n\"Now the rat, though he had helped the weasel, did not half like him,\nfor he was afraid to go to sleep while the weasel was about, lest his\nguest should fasten on his throat, for he knew he was treacherous to the\nlast degree. He cast about in his mind how to get rid of him, and at the\nsame time to serve his own purpose. By-and-by he said that there was a\nmouse in the cart-house who had a very plump wife, and two fat little\nmouses. At this the weasel pricked up his ears, for he was so terribly\nhungry, and sat up and asked where they were. The rat said the wife and\nthe children were up in the beam; the wood had rotted, and they had a\nhole there, but he was afraid the mouse himself was away from home just\nthen, most likely in the corn-bin, where the barley-meal for the pigs\nwas kept.\n\n\"'Never mind,' said the weasel, eagerly, 'the wife and the baby mice\nwill do very well,' and up he started and climbed up through the rat's\nhole in the wall to the roof, and then into the hole in the beam, where\nhe had a good meal on the mice. Now the rat hated this mouse because he\nlived so near, and helped himself to so much food, and being so much\nsmaller, he could get about inside the house where you live, Bevis,\nwithout being seen, and so got very fat, and made the rat jealous. He\nthought, too, that when the weasel had eaten the wife and the babies,\nthat he would be strong enough to go away. Presently the weasel came\ndown from his meal, and looked so fierce and savage that the rat, strong\nas he was, was still more anxious to get rid of him as quickly as\npossible.\n\n\"He told the weasel that there was a way by which he could get to the\ncorn-bin without the least danger, though it was close to the house, and\nthere he would be certain to find the mouse himself, and very likely\nanother Miss Mouse whom he used to meet there. At this the weasel was so\nexcited he could hardly wait to be shown the way, and asked the rat to\nput him in the road directly; he was so hungry he did not care what he\ndid. Without delay the rat took him to the mouth of the hole, and told\nhim to stay there and listen a minute to be sure that no one was coming.\nIf he could not hear any footsteps, all he had to do was to rush across\nthe road there, only two or three yards, to the rough grass, the\ndandelions, and the docks opposite. Just there there was an iron grating\nmade in the wall of the house to let in the air and keep the rats out;\nbut one of the bars had rusted off and was broken, and that was the\nmouse's track to the corn-bin.\n\n\"The weasel put out his head, glanced round, saw no one, and without\nwaiting to listen rushed out into the roadway. In an instant the rat\npushed against a small piece of loose stone, which he kept for the\npurpose, and it fell down and shut up the mouth of his hole. As the\nweasel was running across the roadway suddenly one of the labourers came\nround the corner with a bucket of food for the pigs. Frightened beyond\nmeasure, the weasel hastened back to the rat's hole, but could not get\nin because of the stone. Not knowing what to do, he ran round the\ncart-house, where there was some grass under the wall, with the man\ncoming close behind him. Now it was just there that the bailiff had set\nthe gin for the rat, near the mouth of the drain, but the rat knew all\nabout it, and used the other hole.\n\n\"The grass, knowing that we wished to drive the weasel that way into the\ngin, had tried to grow faster and hide the trap, but could not get on\nvery well because the weather was so dry. But that morning, when the rat\nupset Pan's bowl of water, and it ran down the drain, some part of it\nreached the roots of the grass and moistened them, then the grass shot\nup quick and quite hid the trap, except one little piece. Now, seeing\nthe weasel rushing along in his fright, the grass was greatly excited,\nbut did not know what to do to hide this part, so the grass whispered to\nhis friend the wind to come to his help.\n\n\"This the wind was very ready to do, for this reason--he hated to smell\nthe decaying carcases of the poor creatures the weasel killed, and left\nto rot and to taint the air, so that it quite spoilt his morning ramble\nover the fields. With a puff the wind came along and blew a dead leaf,\none of last year's leaves, over the trap, and so hid it completely.\n\n\"The weasel saw the mouth of the drain, and thinking to be safe in a\nminute darted at it, and was snapped up by the gin. The sudden shock\ndeprived him of sense or motion, and well for him it did, for had he\nsqueaked or moved ever so little the man with the bucket must have seen\nor heard him. After a time he came to himself, and again began to beg\nthe rat to help him; but the rat, having had his revenge on the mouse,\ndid not much care to trouble about it, and, besides, he remembered how\nvery wolfish and fierce the weasel had looked at him when in his hole.\nAt least he thought he would have a night's sleep in comfort first, for\nhe had been afraid to sleep a wink with the weasel so near. Now the\nweasel was in the gin he could have a nap.\n\n\"All night long the weasel was in the gin, and to a certainty he would\nhave been seen--for the bailiff would have been sure to come and look at\nhis trap--but if you remember, Bevis, dear, that was the very day you\nwere lost (while asleep under the oak), and everything was confusion,\nand the gin was forgotten. Well, in the morning the weasel begged so\npiteously of the rat to help him again, that the rat began to think he\nwould, now he had had a good sleep, when just as he was peeping out\nalong you came, Bevis, dear, and found the weasel in the gin.\n\n\"Now, I daresay you remember the talk you had with the weasel, and what\nthe mouse said; well, the rat was listening all the while, and he heard\nthe weasel say to you that he always killed the rats. 'Aha!' thought\nthe rat, 'catch me helping you again, sir;' and the weasel heard him say\nit. So when you stepped on the spring and loosed the weasel, he did not\ndare go into the drain, knowing that the rat (while awake) was stronger\nthan he, but hobbled as well as he could across to the wood-pile. There\nhe stopped, exhausted, and stiff from his wounds. Meantime the rat\ndeliberated how best he could drive the treacherous weasel away from the\nplace.\n\n\"At night, accordingly, he cautiously left his hole and went across to\nthe tub where Pan was sleeping, curled up comfortably within. The end of\nPan's chain, where it was fastened to the staple outside the tub, was\nnot of iron, but tar-cord. The last link had been broken, and it was\ntherefore tied in this manner. The rat easily gnawed through the\ntar-cord, and then slipped back to his hole to await events. About the\nmiddle of the night, when the weasel had rested and began to stir out,\nPan woke up, and seeing that it was light, stepped out to bay at the\nmoon. He immediately found that his chain was undone, and rushed about\nto try and find some water, being very thirsty. He had not gone very far\nbefore he smelt the weasel, and instantly began to chase him. The\nweasel, however, slipped under a faggot, and so across and under the\nwood-pile, where he was safe; but he was so alarmed that presently he\ncrept out the other side, and round by the pig-sty, and so past the\nstable to the rick-yard, and then into the hedge, and he never stopped\nrunning, stiff as he was, till he was half-a-mile away in the ash copse\nand had crept into a rabbit's hole. He could not have got away from the\nwood-pile, only Pan, being so thirsty, gave up looking for him, and went\ndown to the brook.\n\n\"In the morning, as they thought Pan had broken his chain, they kicked\nthe spaniel howling into his tub again. And now comes the sad part of\nit, Bevis, dear. You must know that when the weasel was in the trap we\nall thought it was quite safe, and that our enemy was done for at last,\nand so we went off to a dancing-party, on the short grass of the downs\nby moonlight, leaving our leverets to nibble near the wheat. We stayed\nat the dancing-party so late that the dawn came and we were afraid to go\nhome in the daylight, and next night we all felt so merry we had another\ndance, and again danced till it was morning.\n\n\"While we were sleeping in the day, the weasel, having now recovered a\ngood deal, crept out from the rabbit-hole in the copse. We were so far\noff, you see, the mice could not send us word that he had escaped from\nthe gin in time, and, indeed, none of them knew exactly where to find\nus; they told the swallows, and the swallows searched, but missed us.\nThe wind, too, blew as many ways as he could to try and reach us, but he\nhad to blow east that day, and could not manage it. If we had only been\nat home we should have been on the watch; but my poor leveret, and my\ntwo friends' poor leverets, were sleeping so comfortably when the wicked\nweasel stole on them one by one, and bit their necks and killed them. He\ncould not eat them, nor half of them, he only killed them for revenge,\nand oh! dear little Sir Bevis, what shall I do? what shall I do?\"\n\n\"I will kill the weasel,\" said Bevis. \"He is dreadfully wicked. I will\nshoot him this minute with my bow and arrow.\"\n\nBut when he looked round he had got neither of them; he had dropped the\nbow in the Home Field when he jumped into the ditch to scramble through\nthe hedge, and he had wandered so far among the cowslips that he could\nnot see the arrow. Bevis looked all round again, and did not recognise\nany of the trees, nor the hedges, nor could he see the house nor the\nricks, nor anything that he knew. His face flushed up, and the tears\ncame into his eyes; he was lost.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" said the hare, much pleased at the eagerness with which he\ntook up the quarrel against the weasel; \"don't cry, darling, I will show\nyou the way home and where to find your arrow. It is not very far,\nthough you cannot see it because of the ground rising between you and\nit. But will you really kill the weasel next time?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed I will,\" said Bevis, \"I will shoot my arrow and kill him\nquite dead in a minute.\"\n\n\"But I am not sure you can hit him with your arrow; don't you remember\nthat you could not hit the greenfinches nor the rook?\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Bevis, \"if you will wait till I am a man, papa will\nlend me his gun, and then I can certainly kill him.\"\n\n\"But that will be such a long time, Sir Bevis; did not your papa tell\nyou you would have to eat another peck of salt before you could have a\ngun?\"\n\n\"Then I know what I will do,\" said Bevis, \"I will shoot the weasel with\nmy brass cannon. Ah, that is the way! And I know where papa keeps his\ngunpowder; it is in a tin canister on the topmost shelf, and I will tell\nyou how I climb up there. First, I bring the big arm-chair, and then I\nput the stool on that, and then I stand on the lowest shelf, and I can\njust reach the canister.\"\n\n\"Take care, Sir Bevis,\" said the hare, \"take care, and do not open the\ncanister where there is a fire in the room, or a candle, because a spark\nmay blow you up just when you are not thinking.\"\n\n\"Oh! I know all about that; I'll take care,\" said Bevis, \"and I will\nshoot the wretch of a weasel in no time. Now please show me the way\nhome.\"\n\n\"So I will; you stay there till I come to you, I will run round by the\ngateway.\"\n\n\"Why not come straight through the hedge?\" said Bevis, \"you could easily\ncreep through, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"No, dear. I must not come that way, that road belongs to another hare,\nand I must not trespass.\"\n\n\"But you can run where you like--can you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no; all the hares have different roads, Sir Bevis, and if I\nwere to run along one of theirs that did not belong to me, to-night they\nwould bite me and thump me with their paws till I was all bruised.\"\n\n\"I can't see any path,\" said Bevis, \"you can run where you like in the\nfield, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"No, I can't, dear; I shall have to go a quarter of a mile round to come\nto you, because there are three paths between you and me, and I shall\nhave to turn and twist about not to come on them.\"\n\nWhile Bevis was thinking about this, and how stupid it was of the hares\nto have roads, the hare ran off, and in two or three minutes came to him\nthrough the cowslips. \"Oh, you pretty creature!\" said Sir Bevis,\nstooping down and stroking her back, and playing with the tips of her\nlong ears. \"Oh, I do love you so!\" At this the hare was still more\npleased, and rubbed her head against Bevis's hand.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"you must come along quickly, because I dare not stay\non this short grass, lest some dog should see me. Follow me, dear.\" She\nwent on before him, and Bevis ran behind, and in a minute or two they\nwent over the rising ground, past the tall stone (put there for the cows\nto rub their sides against), and then the hare stopped and showed Bevis\nthe great oak tree, where he once went to sleep. She told him to look at\nit well, and recollect the shape of it, so that another time he could\nfind his way home by the tree. Then she told him to walk straight to the\ntree, and on his way there he would find the arrow, and close by the\ntree was the gap in the hedge, and when he got through the gap, he would\nsee the house and the ricks, and if he followed the ditch then he would\npresently come to the place where he dropped his bow. \"Thank you,\" said\nBevis, \"I will run as fast as I can, for I am sure it must be nearly\ndinner time. Good-bye, you pretty creature;\" and having stroked her ears\njust once more, off he started. In a few minutes he found his arrow, and\nlooked back to show it to the hare, but she was gone; so he went on to\nthe oak, got through the gap, and there was the house at the other side\nof the field. He could hear Pan barking, so he felt quite at home, and\nwalked along the ditch till he picked up his bow. He was very hungry\nwhen he got home, and yet he was glad when the dinner was over, that he\nmight go to the cupboard and get his brass cannon.\n\nWhen he came to examine the cannon, and to think about shooting the\nweasel with it, he soon found that it would not do very well, because he\ncould not hold it in his hand and point it straight, and when it went\noff it would most likely burn his fingers. But looking at his papa's gun\nhe saw that the barrel, where the powder is put in, was fixed in a\nwooden handle called the stock, so he set to work with his pocket-knife\nto make a handle for his cannon. He cut a long thick willow stick,\nchoosing the willow because it was soft and easiest to cut, and chipped\naway till he had made a groove in it at one end in which he put the\ncannon, fastening it in with a piece of thin copper wire twisted round.\nNext he cut a ramrod, and then he loaded his gun, and fired it off with\na match to see how it went.\n\nThis he did at the bottom of the orchard, a long way from the house,\nfor he was afraid that if they saw what he was doing they might take it\nfrom him, so he kept it hidden in the summer-house under an old sack.\nThe cannon went off with a good bang, and the shot he had put in it\nstuck in the bark of an apple tree. Bevis jumped about with delight, and\nthought he could now kill the weasel. It was too late to start that day,\nbut the next morning off he marched with his gun into the Home Field,\nand having charged it behind the shelter of a tree out of sight, began\nhis chase for the weasel.\n\nAll round the field he went, looking carefully into the ditch and the\nhedge, and asking at all the rabbits'-holes if they knew where the\nscoundrel was. The rabbits knew very well, but they were afraid to\nanswer, lest the weasel should hear about it, and come and kill the one\nthat had betrayed him. Twice he searched up and down without success,\nand was just going to call to the hare to come and show him, when\nsuddenly he discovered a thrush sitting on her nest in a bush. He put\ndown his gun, and was going to see how many eggs she had got, when the\nweasel (who had no idea he was there) peeped over the bank, having a\nfancy for the eggs, but afraid that the nest was too high for him to\nreach.\n\n\"Ho! Ho!\" cried Bevis, \"there you are. Now I have you. Just stand still\na minute, while I get my gun and strike a match.\"\n\n\"Whatever for?\" asked the weasel, very innocently.\n\n\"I am going to shoot you,\" said Bevis, busy getting his gun ready.\n\n\"Shoot _me_!\" said the weasel, in a tone of the utmost astonishment;\n\"why ever do you want to shoot me, Sir Bevis? Did I not tell you that I\nspent all my life doing good?\"\n\n\"Yes, you rascal!\" said Bevis, putting a pinch of powder on the\ntouch-hole, \"you know you are a wicked story-teller; you killed the poor\nleveret after I let you loose. Now!\" and he went down on one knee, and\nput his cannon-stick on the other as a rest to keep it straight.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said the weasel, \"just listen to me a minute. I assure\nyou----\"\n\n\"No; I sha'n't listen to you,\" said Bevis, striking his match.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the weasel, kneeling down, \"if you will only wait one second,\nI will tell you all the wickedness I have committed. Don't, please, kill\nme before I have got this load of guilt off my mind.\"\n\n\"Well, make haste,\" said Bevis, aiming along his cannon.\n\n\"I will,\" said the weasel; \"and first of all, if you are going to kill\nme, why don't you shoot the thrush as well, for she is ever so much more\nwicked and cruel than I have been?\"\n\n\"Oh, what a dreadful story!\" said the thrush. \"How can you say so?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are,\" said the weasel. \"Sir Bevis, you remember the two snails\nyou found in the garden path--those you put on a leaf, and watched to\nsee which could crawl the fastest?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Sir Bevis. \"But you must make haste, or my match will\nburn out.\"\n\n\"And you recollect that the snails had no legs and could not walk, and\nthat they had no wings and could not fly, and were very helpless\ncreatures?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember; I left them on the path.\"\n\n\"Well, directly you left them, out came this great ugly speckled thrush\nfrom the shrubbery--you see how big the thrush is, quite a monster\nbeside the poor snails; and you see what long legs she has, and great\nwings, and such a strong, sharp beak. This cruel monster of a thrush\npicked up the snails, one at a time, and smashed them on the stones, and\ngobbled them up.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the thrush, much relieved, \"is that all? snails are very\nnice to eat.\"\n\n\"Was it not brutally cruel?\" asked the weasel.\n\n\"Yes, it was,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Then,\" said the weasel, \"when you shoot me, shoot the thrush too.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Bevis, \"but how can I hit you both?\"\n\n\"I will show you,\" said the weasel. \"I will walk along the bank till I\nam just in a line with the thrush's nest, and then you can take aim at\nboth together.\"\n\nSo he went along the bank and stopped behind the nest, and Bevis moved\nhis cannon-stick and took another aim.\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried the thrush, dreadfully alarmed, \"you surely are not\ngoing to shoot me? I never did any harm. Bevis, stop--listen to me!\"\n\nNow if the thrush had flown away she might have escaped, but she was\nvery fond of talking, and while she was talking Bevis was busy getting\nhis gun ready.\n\n\"It is straight now,\" said the weasel; \"it is pointed quite straight.\nHold it still there, and I will sit so that I shall die quick;--here is\nmy bosom. Tell the hare to forgive me.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the thrush, \"don't shoot!\"\n\n\"Shoot!\" cried the weasel.\n\nBevis dropped his match on the touch-hole, puff went the priming, and\nbang went the cannon. Directly the smoke had cleared away, Bevis looked\nin the ditch, to see the dead weasel and the thrush. There was the\nthrush right enough, quite dead, and fallen out of the nest; the nest,\ntoo, was knocked to pieces, and the eggs had fallen out (two were\nbroken), but there was one not a bit smashed, lying on the dead leaves\nat the bottom of the ditch. But the weasel was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Weasel,\" cried Bevis, \"where are you?\" But the weasel did not answer.\nBevis looked everywhere, over the bank and round about, but could not\nfind him. At last he saw that under some grass on the bank there was a\nsmall rabbit's-hole. Now the weasel had sat up for Bevis to shoot him\nright over this hole, and when he saw him move the match, just as the\npriming went puff, the weasel dropped down into the hole, and the shot\nwent over his head.\n\nBevis was very angry when he saw how the weasel had deceived him, and\nfelt so sorry for the poor thrush, whose speckled breast was all\npierced by the shot, and who would never sing any more. He did not know\nwhat to do, he was so cross; but presently he ran home to fetch Pan, to\nsee if Pan could hunt out the weasel.\n\nWhen he had gone a little way the weasel came out of the hole, and went\ndown into the ditch and feasted on the thrush's egg, which he could not\nhave got had not the shot knocked the nest to pieces, just as he had\ncontrived. He never tasted so sweet an egg as that one, and as he sucked\nit up he laughed as he thought how cleverly he had deceived them all.\nWhen he heard Pan bark he went back into the hole, and so along the\nhedge till he reached the copse; and then creeping into another hole, a\nvery small one, where no dog could get at him, he curled himself up very\ncomfortably and went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. BROOK-FOLK.\n\n\nSome time afterwards it happened one morning that Bevis was sitting on a\nhaycock in the Home Field, eating a very large piece of cake, and\nthinking how extremely greedy the young rook was yonder across the\nmeadow. For he was as big and as black as his father and mother, who\nwere with him; and yet he kept on cawing to them to stuff his beak with\nsweets. Bevis, who had another large slice in his pocket, having stolen\nboth of them from the cupboard just after breakfast, felt angry to see\nsuch greediness, and was going to get up to holloa at this ill-mannered\nrook, when he heard a grasshopper making some remarks close by the\nhaycock.\n\n\"S----s,\" said the grasshopper to a friend, \"are you going down to the\nbrook? I am, in a minute, so soon as I have hopped round this haycock,\nfor there will be a grand show there presently. All the birds are going\nto bathe, as is their custom on Midsummer Day, and will be sure to\nappear in their best feathers. It is true some of them have bathed\nalready, as they have to leave early in the morning, having business\nelsewhere. I spoke to the cricket just now on the subject, but he could\nnot see that it was at all interesting. He is very narrow-minded, as\nyou know, and cannot see anything beyond the mound where he lives.\nS----s.\"\n\n\"S----s,\" replied the other grasshopper; \"I will certainly jump that way\nso soon as I have had a chat with my lady-love, who is waiting for me on\nthe other side of the furrow. S----s.\"\n\n\"S----s, we shall meet by the drinking-place,\" said the first\ngrasshopper; and was just hopping off when Bevis asked him what the\nbirds went down to bathe for.\n\n\"I'm sure I do not know,\" said the grasshopper, speaking fast, for he\nwas rather in a hurry to be gone, he never could stand still long\ntogether. \"All I can tell you is that on Midsummer Day every one of the\nbirds has to go down to the brook and walk in and bathe; and it has been\nthe law for so many, many years that no one can remember when it began.\nThey like it very much, because they can show off their fine feathers,\nwhich are just now in full colour; and if you like to go with me you\nwill be sure to enjoy it.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Bevis, and he followed the grasshopper, who hopped so\nfar at every step that he had to walk fast to keep up with him. \"But why\ndo the birds do it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know why,\" said the grasshopper; \"what is why?\"\n\n\"I want to know,\" said Bevis, \"why do they do it?\"\n\n\"Why?\" repeated the grasshopper; \"I never heard anybody say anything\nabout that before. There is always a great deal of talking going on,\nfor the trees have nothing else to do but to gossip with each other; but\nthey never ask why.\"\n\nAfter that they went on in silence a good way except that the\ngrasshopper cried \"S----s\" to his friends in the grass as he passed, and\nsaid good-morning also to a mole who peeped out for a moment.\n\n\"Why don't you hop straight?\" said Bevis, presently. \"It seems to me\nthat you hop first one side and then the other, and go in such a zig-zag\nfashion it will take us hours to reach the brook.\"\n\n\"How very stupid you are,\" said the grasshopper. \"If you go straight of\ncourse you can only see just what is under your feet, but if you go\nfirst this way and then that, then you see everything. You are nearly as\nsilly as the ants, who never see anything beautiful all their lives. Be\nsure you have nothing to do with the ants, Bevis; they are a mean,\nwretched, miserly set, quite contemptible and beneath notice. Now I go\neverywhere all round the field, and spend my time searching for lovely\nthings; sometimes I find flowers, and sometimes the butterflies come\ndown into the grass and tell me the news, and I am so fond of the\nsunshine, I sing to it all day long. Tell me, now, is there anything so\nbeautiful as the sunshine and the blue sky, and the green grass, and the\nvelvet and blue and spotted butterflies, and the trees which cast such a\npleasant shadow and talk so sweetly, and the brook which is always\nrunning? I should like to listen to it for a thousand years.\"\n\n\"I like you,\" said Bevis; \"jump into my hand, and I will carry you.\" He\nheld his hand out flat, and in a second up sprang the grasshopper, and\nalighted on his palm, and told him the way to go, and thus they went\ntogether merrily.\n\n\"Are you sure the ants are so very stupid and wicked?\" asked Bevis, when\nthe grasshopper had guided him through a gateway into the meadow by the\nbrook.\n\n\"Indeed I am. It is true they declare that it is I who am wrong, and\nnever lose a chance of chattering at me, because they are always laying\nup a store, and I wander about, laughing and singing. But then you see,\nBevis dear, they are quite demented, and so led away by their greedy,\nselfish wishes that they do not even know that there is a sun. They say\nthey cannot see it, and do not believe there is any sunshine, nor do\nthey believe there are any stars. Now I do not sing at night, but I\nalways go where I can see a star. I slept under a mushroom last night,\nand he told me he was pushing up as fast as he could before some one\ncame and picked him to put on a gridiron. I do not lay up any store,\nbecause I know I shall die when the summer ends, and what is the use of\nwealth then? My store and my wealth is the sunshine, dear, and the blue\nsky, and the green grass, and the delicious brook who never ceases sing,\nsing, singing all day and night. And all the things are fond of me, the\ngrass and the flowers, and the birds, and the animals, all of them love\nme. So you see I am richer than all the ants put together.\" \"I would\nrather be you than an ant,\" said Bevis. \"I think I shall take you home\nand put you under a glass-case on the mantelpiece.\"\n\nOff jumped the grasshopper in a moment, and fell so lightly on the grass\nit did not hurt him in the least, though it was as far as if Bevis had\ntumbled down out of the clouds. Bevis tried to catch him, but he jumped\nso nimbly this way and that, and hopped to and fro, and lay down in the\ngrass, so that his green coat could not be seen. Bevis got quite hot\ntrying to catch him, and seeing this, the grasshopper, much delighted,\ncried out: \"Are you not the stupid boy everybody is laughing at for\nletting the weasel go? You will never catch the weasel.\"\n\n\"I'll stamp on you,\" said Bevis, in a great rage.\n\n\"S----s,\" called the grasshopper--who was frightened at this--to his\nfriends, and in a minute there were twenty of them jumping all round in\nevery direction, and as they were all just alike Bevis did not know\nwhich to run after. When he looked up there was the brook close by, and\nthe drinking-place where the birds were to meet and bathe. It was a spot\nwhere the ground shelved gently down from the grass to the brook; the\nstream was very shallow and flowed over the sandy bottom with a gentle\nmurmur.\n\nHe went down to the brook and stood on the bank, where it was high near\na bush at the side of the drinking-place. \"Ah, dear little Sir Bevis!\"\nwhispered a reed, bending towards him as the wind blew, \"please do not\ncome any nearer, the bank is steep and treacherous, and hollow\nunderneath where the water-rats run. So do not lean over after the\nforget-me-nots--they are too far for you. Sit down where you are, behind\nthat little bush, and I will tell you all about the bathing.\" Bevis sat\ndown and picked a June rose from a briar that trailed over the bush, and\nasked why the birds bathed.\n\n\"I do not know why,\" said the reed. \"There is no why at all. We have\nbeen listening to the brook, me and my family, for ever so many\nthousands of years, and though the brook has been talking and singing\nall that time, I never heard him ask why about anything. And the great\noak, where you went to sleep, has been there, goodness me, nobody can\ntell how long, and every one of his leaves (he has had millions of them)\nhave all been talking, but not one of them ever asked why; nor does the\nsun, nor the stars which I see every night shining in the clear water\ndown there, so that I am quite sure there is no why at all.\n\n\"But the birds come down to bathe every Midsummer Day, the goldfinches,\nand the sparrows, and the blackbirds, and the thrushes, and the\nswallows, and the wrens, and the robins, and almost every one of them,\nexcept two or three, whose great-grandfathers got into disgrace a long\nwhile ago. The rooks do not come because they are thieves, and steal the\nmussels, nor the crows, who are a very bad lot; the swan does not come\neither, unless the brook is muddy after a storm. The swan is so tired of\nseeing himself in the water that he quite hates it, and that is the\nreason he holds his neck so high, that he may not see more of himself\nthan he can help.\n\n\"It is no use your asking the brook why they come, because even if he\never knew, he has forgotten. For the brook, though he sparkles so bright\nin the sun, and is so clear and sweet, and looks so young, is really so\nvery, very old that he has quite lost his memory, and cannot remember\nwhat was done yesterday. He did not even know which way the moor-hen\nwent just now, when I inquired, having a message to send to my relations\nby the osier-bed yonder.\n\n\"But I have heard the heron say--he is talkative sometimes at night when\nyou are asleep, dear; he was down here this morning paddling about--that\nthe birds in the beginning learnt to sing by listening to the brook, and\nperhaps that is the reason they pay him such deep respect. Besides,\neverybody knows that according to an ancient prophecy which was\ndelivered by the raven before he left this country, if only the birds\ncan all bathe in the brook on Midsummer Day and hold their tongues, and\nnot abuse one another or quarrel, they will be able to compose their\ndifferences, and ever afterwards live happily together.\n\n\"Then they could drive away the hawk, for there is only one hawk to ten\nthousand finches, and if they only marched shoulder to shoulder all\ntogether they could kill him with ease. They could smother the cat even,\nby all coming down at once upon her, or they could carry up a stone and\ndrop on her head; and as for the crow, that old coward, if he saw them\ncoming he would take wing at once. But as they cannot agree, the hawk,\nand the cat, and the crow do as they like. For the chaffinches all fight\none another, you heard them challenging, and saw them go to battle, and\nthen when at last they leave off and are good fellows again, they all\nflock together and will have nothing to do with the goldfinches, or the\nblackbirds. It is true the wood-pigeons, and the rooks, and the\nstarlings, and the fieldfares and redwings are often about in the same\nfield, but that is only because they eat the same things; if a hawk\ncomes they all fly away from each other, and do not unite and fight him\nas they might do.\n\n\"But if once they could come down to the brook on Midsummer Day, and\nnever quarrel, then, according to the prophecy I told you of, all this\ndiversity would cease, and they would be able to do just as they\npleased, and build three or four nests in the summer instead of one, and\ndrive away and kill all the hawks, and crows, and cats. They tried to do\nit, I can't tell you how many years, but they could never succeed, for\nthere was always a dispute about something, so at last they gave it up,\nand it was almost forgotten (for they came to the conclusion that it was\nno use to try), till last year, when the mole, the one that spoke to the\ngrasshopper just now, reminded them of it.\n\n\"Now the reason the mole reminded them of it was because one day a hawk\ncame down too quick for his wife (who was peeping out of doors), and\nsnapped her up in a minute, so he bore the hawk a grudge, and set about\nto seek for vengeance. And as he could not fly or get at the hawk he\nthought he would manage it through the other birds. So one morning when\nthe green woodpecker came down to pick up the ants with his tongue, the\nmole looked out and promised to show him where there was a capital\nfeast, and to turn up the ground for him, if in return he would fly all\nround the forest and the fields, and cry shame on the birds for letting\nthe hawk go on as he did when they could so easily prevent it, just by\nholding their tongues one day.\n\n\"This the woodpecker promised to do, and after he had feasted off he\nwent, and having tapped on a tree to call attention, he began to cry\nshame upon them, and having a very loud voice he soon let them know his\nmind. At which the birds resolved to try again, and, do you know, last\nyear they very nearly succeeded. For it rained hard all Midsummer Day,\nand when the birds came down to the brook they were so bedraggled, and\nbenumbed, and cold, and unhappy, that they had nothing to say for\nthemselves, but splashed about in silence, and everything would have\nhappened just right had not a rook, chancing to pass over, accidentally\ndropped something he was carrying in his bill, which fell into the flags\nthere.\n\n\"The starling forgot himself, and remarked he supposed it was an acorn;\nwhen the wood-pigeon called him a donkey, as the acorns were not yet\nripe, nor large enough to eat; and the usual uproar began again. But\nafterwards, when they talked it over, they said to each other that, as\nthey had so nearly done it, it must be quite possible, and next year\nthey would all hold their tongues as tight as wax, though the sun should\ndrop out of the sky. Now the hawk, of course, being so high up, circling\nround, saw and heard all this, and he was very much alarmed, as they had\nso nearly succeeded; and he greatly feared lest next year, what he had\ndreaded so long would come to pass, as the raven had foretold.\n\n\"So he flew down and took counsel of his ancient friend the weasel. What\nthey said I cannot tell you, nor has it been found out, but I have no\ndoubt they made up something wicked between them, and it is greatly to\nbe regretted that you let the weasel go, for the hawk, sharp as he is,\nis not very clever at anything new, and if he had not got the weasel to\nadvise him I suspect he would not be much after all. We shall see\npresently what they have contrived--I am much mistaken if they have not\nput their heads together for something. Do you keep quite still, Bevis\ndear, when the birds come, and take care and not frighten them.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Bevis; \"I will be very quiet.\"\n\n\"It is my turn to tell you a story now,\" said a green flag waving to and\nfro in the brook. \"The reed has been talking too much.\"\n\n\"No, it is my turn,\" said a perch from the water under the bank. Bevis\nleaned over a little, and could see the bars across his back and sides.\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" replied the flag; \"you ate the roach this morning,\nwhose silvery scales used to flash like a light under the water.\"\n\n\"I will nibble you,\" said the perch, very angry. \"I will teach you to\ntell tales.\"\n\n\"I will ask the willow, he is a very old friend of mine, not to shake\nany more insects into the brook for you from his leaves,\" replied the\nflag.\n\n\"It was not I who ate the roach,\" said the perch; \"it was the pike,\nBevis dear.\"\n\n\"Indeed it was not,\" said the pike, coming forward a little from under\nsome floating weeds, where he had been in hiding, so that Bevis could\nnow see his long body. \"The perch says things that are not true.\"\n\n\"You know you hate me,\" said the perch; \"because your\ngreat-great-grandfather swallowed mine in a rage, and my\ngreat-great-grandfather's spines stuck in your great-great-grandfather's\nthroat and killed him. And ever since then, Bevis dear, they have done\nnothing but tell tales against me. I did not touch the roach; the pike\nwanted him, I know, for breakfast.\"\n\n\"I deny it,\" said the pike; \"but if it was not the perch it was the\nrat.\"\n\n\"That's false,\" said the rat; \"I have only this minute come down to the\nbrook. If it was not the pike nor the perch, depend upon it it was the\nheron.\"\n\n\"I am sure it was not the heron,\" said a beautiful drake, who came\nswimming down the stream. \"I was here as early as any one, and I will\nnot have my acquaintance the heron accused in his absence. I assure you\nit was not the heron.\"\n\n\"Well, who did it then?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said a frog on the verge of the stream, \"they are all as\nbad as one another; the perch is a rogue and a thief; the pike is a\nmonster of iniquity; the heron never misses a chance of gobbling up\nsomebody; and as for the drake, for all his glossy neck and his innocent\nlook, he is as ready to pick up anything as the rest.\"\n\n\"Quack,\" cried the drake in a temper; \"quack.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said a tench from the bottom of a deep hole under the bank--he\nwas always a peacemaker. \"Hush! do stop the noise you are making. If you\nwould only lie quiet in the mud like me, how pleasant you would find\nlife.\"\n\n\"Bevis,\" began the reed; \"Bevis dear. Ah, ah!\" His voice died away, for\nas the sun got higher the wind fell, and the reed could only speak while\nthe wind blew. The flag laughed as the reed was silenced.\n\n\"You need not laugh,\" said the perch; \"you can only talk while the water\nwaggles you. The horse will come down to the brook to-morrow, and bite\noff your long green tip, and then you will not be able to start any more\nfalsehoods about me.\"\n\n\"The birds are coming,\" said the frog. \"I should like to swim across to\nthe other side, where I can see better, but I am afraid of the pike and\nthe drake. Bevis dear, fling that piece of dead stick at them.\"\n\nBevis picked up the dead stick and flung it at the drake, who hastened\noff down the stream; the pike, startled at the splash, darted up the\nbrook, and the frog swam over in a minute. Then the birds began to come\ndown to the drinking-place, where the shore shelved very gently, and the\nclear shallow water ran over the sandy bottom. They were all in their\nvery best and brightest feathers, and as the sun shone on them and they\nsplashed the water and strutted about, Bevis thought he had never seen\nanything so beautiful.\n\nThey did not all bathe, for some of them were specially permitted only\nto drink instead, but they all came, and all in their newest dresses. So\nbright was the goldfinch's wing, that the lark, though she did not dare\nspeak, had no doubt she rouged. The sparrow, brushed and neat, so quiet\nand subdued in his brown velvet, looked quite aristocratic among so much\nflaunting colour. As for the blackbird, he had carefully washed himself\nin the spring before he came to bathe in the brook, and he glanced round\nwith a bold and defiant air, as much as to say: \"There is not one of you\nwho has so yellow a bill, and so beautiful a black coat as I have\". In\nthe bush the bullfinch, who did not care much to mix with the crowd,\nmoved restlessly to and fro. The robin looked all the time at Bevis, so\nanxious was he for admiration. The wood-pigeon, very consequential,\naffected not to see the dove, whom Bevis longed to stroke, but could\nnot, as he had promised the reed to keep still.\n\nAll this time the birds, though they glanced at one another, and those\nwho were on good terms, like the chaffinch and the greenfinch, exchanged\na nod, had not spoken a word, and the reed, as a puff came, whispered to\nBevis that the prophecy would certainly come to pass, and they would\nall be as happy as ever they could be. Why ever did they not make haste\nand fly away, now they had all bathed or sipped? The truth was, they\nliked to be seen in their best feathers, and none of them could make up\ntheir minds to be the first to go home; so they strutted to and fro in\nthe sunshine. Bevis, in much excitement, could hardly refrain from\ntelling them to go.\n\nHe looked up into the sky, and there was the hawk, almost up among the\nwhite clouds, soaring round and round, and watching all that was\nproceeding. Almost before he could look down again a shadow went by, and\na cuckoo flew along very low, just over the drinking-place.\n\n\"Cuckoo!\" he cried, \"cuckoo! The goldfinch has the prettiest dress,\" and\noff he went.\n\nNow the hawk had bribed the cuckoo, who was his cousin, to do this, and\nthe cuckoo was not at all unwilling, for he had an interest himself in\nkeeping the birds divided, so he said that although he had made up his\nmind to go on his summer tour, leaving his children to be taken care of\nby the wagtail, he would stop a day or two longer, to manage this little\nbusiness. No sooner had the cuckoo said this, than there was a most\nterrible uproar, and all the birds cried out at once. The blackbird was\nso disgusted that he flew straight off, chattering all across the field\nand up the hedge. The bullfinch tossed his head, and asked the goldfinch\nto come up in the bush and see which was strongest. The greenfinch and\nthe chaffinch shrieked with derision; the wood-pigeon turned his back,\nand said \"Pooh!\" and went off with a clatter. The sparrow flew to tell\nhis mates on the house, and you could hear the chatter they made about\nit, right down at the brook. But the wren screamed loudest of all, and\nsaid that the goldfinch was a painted impostor, and had not got half so\nmuch gold as the yellow-hammer. So they were all scattered in a minute,\nand Bevis stood up.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the reed, \"I am very sorry. It was the hawk's doings, I am\nsure, and he was put up to the trick by the weasel, and now the birds\nwill never agree, for every year they will remember this. Is it not a\npity they are so vain? Bevis dear, you are going, I see. Come down\nagain, dear, when the wind blows stronger, and I will tell you another\nstory. Ah! ah!\" he sighed; and was silent as the puff ceased.\n\nBevis, tired of sitting so long, went wandering up the brook, peeping\ninto the hollow willow trees, wishing he could dive like the rats, and\nsinging to the brook, who sang to him again, and taught him a very old\ntune. By-and-by he came to the hatch, where the brook fell over with a\nsplash, and a constant bubbling, and churning, and gurgling. A\nkingfisher, who had been perched on the rail of the hatch, flew off when\nhe saw Bevis, whistling: \"Weep! weep!\"\n\n\"Why do you say, weep, weep?\" said Bevis. \"Is it because the birds are\nso foolish?\" But the kingfisher did not stay to answer. The water\nrushing over the hatch made so pleasant a sound that Bevis, delighted\nwith its tinkling music, sat down to listen and to watch the bubbles,\nand see how far they would swim before they burst. Then he threw little\npieces of stick on the smooth surface above the hatch to see them come\nfloating over and plunge under the bubbles, and presently appear again\nby the foam on the other side among the willow roots.\n\nStill more sweetly sang the brook, so that even restless Bevis stayed to\nhearken, though he could not quite make out what he was saying. A\nmoor-hen stole out from the rushes farther up, seeing that Bevis was\nstill enchanted with the singing, and began to feed among the green\nweeds by the shore. A water-rat came out of his hole and fed in the\ngrass close by. A blue dragon-fly settled on a water-plantain. Up in the\nash-tree a dove perched and looked down at Bevis. Only the gnats were\nbusy; they danced and danced till Bevis thought they must be dizzy, just\nover the water.\n\n\"Sing slower,\" said Bevis presently, \"I want to hear what you are\nsaying.\" So the brook sang slower, but then it was too low, and he could\nnot catch the words. Then he thought he should like to go over to the\nother side, and see what there was up the high bank among the brambles.\nHe looked at the hatch, and saw that there was a beam across the brook,\nbrown with weeds, which the water only splashed against and did not\ncover deeply. By holding tight to the rail and putting his feet on the\nbeam he thought he could climb over.\n\nHe went down nearer and took hold of the rail, and was just going to put\nhis foot on the beam, when the brook stopped singing, and said: \"Bevis\ndear, do not do that; it is very deep here, and the beam is very\nslippery, and if you should fall I would hold you up as long as I could,\nbut I am not very strong, and should you come to harm I should be very\nunhappy. Do please go back to the field, and if you will come down some\nday when I am not in such a hurry, I will sing to you very slowly, and\ntell you everything I know. And if you come very gently, and on tip-toe,\nyou will see the kingfisher, or perhaps the heron.\" Bevis, when he heard\nthis, went back, and followed the hedge a good way, not much thinking\nwhere he was going, but strolling along in the shadow, and humming to\nhimself the tune he had learnt from the brook. By-and-by he spied a gap\nin the hedge under an ash-tree, so he went through in a minute, and\nthere was a high bank with trees like a copse, and bramble-bushes and\nferns. He went on up the bank, winding in and out the brambles, and at\nlast it was so steep he had to climb on his hands and knees, and\nsuddenly as he came round a bramble-bush there was the Long Pond, such a\ngreat piece of water, all gleaming in the sunshine and reaching far away\nto the woods and the hills, as if it had no end.\n\nBevis clapped his hands with delight, and was just going to stand up,\nwhen something caught him by the ankles; he looked round, and it was the\nbailiff, who had had an eye on him all the time from the hayfield. Bevis\nkicked and struggled, but it was no use; the bailiff carried him home,\nand then went back with a bill-hook, and cutting a thorn bush, stopped\nup the gap in the hedge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. KAPCHACK.\n\n\n\"Q--q--q,\" Bevis heard a starling say some weeks afterwards on the\nchimney-top one morning when he woke up. The chimney was very old and\nbig, and the sound came down it to his room. \"Q--q--q, my dear, I will\ntell you a secret\"--he was talking to his lady-love.\n\n\"Phe-hu,\" she said, in a flutter. Bevis could hear her wings go plainly.\n\"Whatever is it? Do tell me.\"\n\n\"Look all round first,\" he said, \"and see that no one is about.\"\n\n\"No one is near, dear; the sparrows are out in the corn, and the\nswallows are very high up; the blackbird is busy in the orchard, and the\nrobin is down at the red currants; there's no one near. Is it a very\ngreat secret?\"\n\n\"It is a very great secret indeed, and you must be very careful not to\nwhistle it out by accident; now if I tell you will you keep your beak\nquite shut, darling?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Then, listen--Kapchack is in love.\"\n\n\"Phe--hu--u; who is it? Is he going to be married? How old is she? Who\ntold you? When did you hear it? Whatever will people say? Tell me all\nabout it, dear!\"\n\n\"The tomtit told me just now in the fir-tree; the woodpecker told him on\nhis promising that he would not tell anybody else.\"\n\n\"When is the marriage to come off, dear?\" she asked, interrupting him.\n\"Kapchack--Phe--u!\"\n\nSomebody came round the house, and away they flew, just as Bevis was\ngoing to ask all about it. He went to the window as soon as he was\ndressed, and as he opened it he saw a fly on the pane; he thought he\nwould ask the fly, but instantly the fly began to fidget, and finding\nthat the top of the window was open out he went, buzzing that Kapchack\nwas in love. At breakfast time a wasp came in--for the fruit was\nbeginning to ripen, and the wasps to get busy--and he went all round the\nroom saying that Kapchack was in love, but he would not listen to\nanything Bevis asked, he was so full of Kapchack. When Bevis ran out of\ndoors the robin on the palings immediately said: \"Kapchack is in love;\ndo you know Kapchack is in love?\" and a second afterwards the wren flew\nup to the top of the wood-pile and cried out just the same thing.\n\nThree finches passed him as he went up the garden, telling each other\nthat Kapchack was in love. The mare in the meadow whinnied to her colt\nthat Kapchack was in love, and the cows went \"boo\" when they heard it,\nand \"booed\" it to some more cows ever so far away. The leaves on the\napple-tree whispered it, and the news went all down the orchard in a\nmoment; and everything repeated it. Bevis got into his swing, and as he\nswung to and fro he heard it all round him.\n\nA humble-bee went along the grass telling all the flowers that were\nleft, and then up into the elm, and the elm told the ash, and the ash\ntold the oak, and the oak told the hawthorn, and it ran along the hedge\ntill it reached the willow, and the willow told the brook, and the brook\ntold the reeds, and the reeds told the kingfisher, and the kingfisher\nwent a mile down the stream and told the heron, and the heron went up\ninto the sky and called it out as loud as he could, and a rabbit heard\nit and told another rabbit, and he ran across to the copse and told\nanother, and he told a mouse, and he told a butterfly, and the butterfly\ntold a moth, and the moth went into the great wood and told another\nmoth, and a wood-pigeon heard it and told more wood-pigeons, and so\neverybody said: \"Kapchack is in love!\"\n\n\"But I thought it was a great secret,\" said Bevis to a thrush, \"and that\nnobody knew it, except the tomtit, and the woodpecker, and the starling;\nand, besides, who is Kapchack?\" The thrush was in the bushes where they\ncame to the haha, and when he heard Bevis ask who Kapchack was, he\nlaughed, and said he should tell everybody that Bevis, who shot his\nuncle with the cannon-stick, was so very, very stupid he did not know\nwho Kapchack was. Ha! Ha! Could anybody be so ignorant? he should not\nhave believed it if he had not heard it.\n\nBevis, in a rage at this, jumped out of the swing and threw a stone at\nthe thrush, and so well did he fling it that if the thrush had not\nslipped under a briar he would have had a good thump. Bevis went\nwandering round the garden, and into his summer-house, when he heard\nsome sparrows in the ivy on the roof all chattering about Kapchack, and\nout he ran to ask them, but they were off in a second to go and tell the\nyellow-hammers. Bevis stamped his foot, he was so cross because nobody\nwould tell him about Kapchack, and he could not think what to do, till\nas he was looking round the garden he saw the rhubarb, and remembered\nthe old toad. Very likely the toad would know; he was so old, and knew\nalmost everything. Away he ran to the rhubarb and looked under the piece\nof wood, and there was the toad asleep, just as he always was.\n\nHe was so firm asleep, he did not know what Bevis said, till Bevis got a\ntwig and poked him a little. Then he yawned and woke up, and asked Bevis\nwhat time it was, and how long it would be before the moon rose.\n\n\"I want to know who Kapchack is, this minute,\" said Bevis, \"this _very_\nminute, mind.\"\n\n\"Well I never!\" said the toad, \"well I never! Don't you know?\"\n\n\"Tell me directly--this very minute--you horrid old toad!\"\n\n\"Don't you really know?\" said the toad.\n\n\"I'll have you shovelled up, and flung over to the pigs, if you don't\ntell me,\" said Bevis. \"No, I'll get my cannon-stick, and shoot you! No,\nhere's a big stone--I'll smash you! I hate you! Who's Kapchack?\"\n\n\"Kapchack,\" said the toad, not in the least frightened, \"Kapchack is the\nmagpie; and he is king over everything and everybody--over the fly and\nthe wasp, and the finches, and the heron, and the horse, and the rabbit,\nand the flowers, and the trees. Kapchack, the great and mighty magpie,\nis the king,\" and the toad bumped his chin on the ground, as if he stood\nbefore the throne, so humble was he at the very name of Kapchack. Then\nhe shut one eye in a very peculiar manner, and put out his tongue.\n\n\"Why don't you like Kapchack?\" said Bevis, who understood him in a\nminute.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the toad, and he repeated out loud, \"Kapchack is the great\nand noble magpie--Kapchack is the king!\" Then he whispered to Bevis to\nsit down on the grass very near him, so that he might speak to him\nbetter, and not much louder than a whisper. When Bevis had sat down and\nstooped a little, the toad came close to the mouth of his hole, and said\nvery quietly: \"Bevis dear, Kapchack is a horrid wretch!\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Bevis, \"why do you hate him? and where does he live? and why\nis he king? I suppose he is very beautiful?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no!\" said the toad, hastily, \"he is the ugliest creature that\never hopped. The feathers round one eye have all come out and left a\nbare place, and he is quite blind on the other. Indeed his left eye is\ngone altogether. His beak is chipped and worn; his wings are so beaten\nand decayed that he can hardly fly; and there are several feathers out\nof his tail. He is the most miserable thing you ever saw.\"\n\n\"Then why is he king?\" asked Bevis.\n\n\"Because he is,\" said the toad; \"and as he is king, nobody else can be.\nIt is true he is very wise--at least everybody says so--wiser than the\ncrow or the rook, or the weasel (though the weasel is so cunning). And\nbesides, he is so old, so very old, nobody knows when he was born, and\nthey say that he will always live, and never die. Why, he put my\ngrandfather in prison.\"\n\n\"In prison?\" said Bevis. \"Where is the prison?\"\n\n\"In the elm-tree, at the top of the Home Field,\" said the toad. \"My\ngrandfather has been shut up there in a little dungeon so tight, he\ncannot turn round, or sit, or stand, or lie down, for so long a time\nthat, really, Bevis dear, I cannot tell you; but it was before you were\nborn. And all that time he has had nothing to eat or drink, and he has\nnever seen the sun or felt the air, and I do not suppose he has ever\nheard anything unless when the thunderbolt fell on the oak close by.\nPerhaps he heard the thunder then.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what has he been doing?\" asked Bevis, \"and why doesn't he\nget out?\"\n\n\"He cannot get out, because the tree has grown all round him quite hard,\nas Kapchack knew it would when he ordered him to be put there in the\nhole. He has not been doing anything but thinking.\"\n\n\"I should get tired of thinking all that time,\" said Bevis; \"but why was\nhe put there?\"\n\n\"For reasons of state,\" said the toad. \"He knows too much. Once upon a\ntime he saw Kapchack do something, I do not know what it was, and\nKapchack was very angry, and had him put in there in case he should tell\nother people. I went and asked him what it was before the tree quite\nshut him in, while there was just a little chink you could talk through;\nbut he always told me to stop in my hole and mind my own business, else\nperhaps I should get punished, as he had been. But he did tell me that\nhe could not help it, that he did not mean to see it, only just at the\nmoment it happened he turned round in his bed, and he opened his eyes\nfor a second, and you know the consequences, Bevis dear. So I advise you\nalways to look the other way, unless you're wanted.\"\n\n\"It was very cruel of Kapchack,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Kapchack is very cruel,\" said the toad, \"and very greedy, more greedy\neven than the ants; and he has such a treasure in his palace as never\nwas heard of. No one can tell how rich he is. And as for cruelty, why,\nhe killed his uncle only a week since, just for not answering him the\nvery instant he spoke; he pecked him in the forehead and killed him.\nThen he killed the poor little wren, whom he chanced to hear say that\nthe king was not so beautiful as her husband. Next he pecked a thrush to\ndeath, because the thrush dared to come into his orchard without\nspecial permission.\n\n\"But it is no use my trying to tell you all the shameful things he has\ndone in all these years. There is never a year goes by without his doing\nsomething dreadful; and he has made everybody miserable at one time or\nother by killing their friends or relations, from the snail to the\npartridge. He is quite merciless, and spares no one; why, his own\nchildren are afraid of him, and it is believed that he has pecked\nseveral of them to death, though it is hushed up; but people talk about\nit all the same, sometimes. As for the way he has behaved to the ladies,\nif I were to tell you you would never believe it.\"\n\n\"I hate him,\" said Bevis. \"Why ever do they let him be king? How they\nmust hate him.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, they don't, dear,\" said the toad. \"If you were to hear how they\ngo on, you would think he was the nicest and kindest person that ever\nexisted. They sing his praises all day long; that is, in the spring and\nsummer, while the birds have their voices. You must have heard them,\nonly you did not understand them. The finches and the thrushes, and the\nyellow-hammers and the wrens, and all the birds, every one of them,\nexcept Choo Hoo, the great rebel, sing Kapchack's praises all day long,\nand tell him that they love him more than they love their eggs, or their\nwives, or their nests, and that he is the very best and nicest of all,\nand that he never did anything wrong, but is always right and always\njust.\n\n\"And they say his eye is brighter than the sun, and that he can see more\nwith his one eye than all the other birds put together; and that his\nfeathers are blacker and whiter and more beautiful than anything else in\nthe world, and his voice sweeter than the nightingale's. Now, if you\nwill stoop a little lower I will whisper to you the reason they do this\n(Bevis stooped down close); the truth is they are afraid lest he should\ncome himself and peck their eggs, or their children, or their wives, or\nif not himself that he should send the hawk, or the weasel, or the\nstoat, or the rat, or the crow. Don't you ever listen to the crow,\nBevis; he is a black scoundrel.\n\n\"For Kapchack has got all the crows, and hawks, and weasels (especially\nthat very cunning one, that old wretch that cheated you), and rats, to\ndo just as he tells them. They are his soldiers, and they carry out his\nbidding quicker than you can wink your eye, or than I can shoot out my\ntongue, which I can do so quickly that you cannot see it. When the\nspring is over and the birds lose their voices (many of them have\nalready), they each send one or two of their number every day to visit\nthe orchard where Kapchack lives, and to say (as they can no longer\nsing) that they still think just the same, and they are all his very\nhumble servants. Kapchack takes no notice of them whatever unless they\nhappen to do what he does not like, and then they find out very soon\nthat he has got plenty of spies about.\n\n\"My opinion is that the snail is no better than a spy and a common\ninformer. Do you just look round and turn over any leaves that are\nnear, lest any should be here, and tell tales about me. I can tell you,\nit is a very dangerous thing to talk about Kapchack, somebody or other\nis sure to hear, and to go and tell him, so as to get into favour. Now,\nthat is what I hate. All the rabbits and hares (and your friend the hare\nthat lives at the top of the Home Field), and the squirrel and the\nmouse, all of them have to do just the same as the birds, and send\nmessages to Kapchack, praising him and promising to do exactly as he\ntells them, all except Choo Hoo.\"\n\n\"Who is Choo Hoo?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Choo Hoo is the great wood-pigeon,\" said the toad. \"He is a rebel; but\nI cannot tell you much about him, for it is only of late years that we\nhave heard anything of him, and I do not know much about the present\nstate of things. Most of the things I can tell you happened, or began, a\nlong time ago. If you want to know what is going on now, the best person\nyou can go to is the squirrel. He is a very good fellow; he can tell\nyou. I will give you a recommendation to him, or perhaps he will be\nafraid to open his mouth too freely; for, as I said before, it is a very\ndangerous thing to talk about Kapchack, and everybody is most terribly\nafraid of him--he is so full of malice.\"\n\n\"Why ever do they let him be king?\" said Bevis; \"I would not, if I were\nthem. Why ever do they put up with him, and his cruelty and greediness?\nI will tell the thrush and the starling not to endure him any longer.\"\n\n\"Pooh! pooh!\" said the toad. \"It is all very well for you to say so, but\nyou must excuse me for saying, my dear Sir Bevis, that you really know\nvery little about it. The thrush and the starling would not understand\nwhat you meant. The thrush's father always did as Kapchack told him, and\nsang his praises, as I told you, and so did his grandfather, and his\ngreat-grandfather, and all his friends and relations, these years and\nyears past. So that now the thrushes have no idea of there being no\nKapchack. They could not understand you, if you tried to explain to them\nhow nice it would be without him. If you sat in your swing and talked to\nthem all day long, for all the summer through, they would only think you\nvery stupid even to suppose such a state of things as no Kapchack. Quite\nimpossible, Bevis dear!--excuse me correcting you. Why, instead of\nliking it, they would say it would be very dreadful to have no\nKapchack.\"\n\n\"Well, they are silly!\" said Bevis. \"But _you_ do not like Kapchack!\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" said the toad; \"and if you will stoop down\nagain----(Bevis stooped still nearer.) No; perhaps you had better lie\ndown on the grass! There--now I can talk to you quite freely. The fact\nis, do you know, there are other people besides me who do not like\nKapchack. The crow--I can't have anything to do with such an old\nrogue!--the crow, I am certain, hates Kapchack, but he dares not say so.\nNow I am so old, and they think me so stupid and deaf that people say a\ngood deal before me, never imagining that I take any notice. And when I\nhave been out of a dewy evening, I have distinctly heard the crow\ngrumbling about Kapchack. The crow thinks he is quite as clever as\nKapchack, and would make quite as good a king.\n\n\"Nor is the rat satisfied, nor the weasel, nor the hawk. I am sure they\nare not, but they cannot do anything alone, and they are so suspicious\nof each other they cannot agree. So that, though they are dissatisfied,\nthey can do nothing. I daresay Kapchack knows it very well indeed. He is\nso wise--so very, very wise--that he can see right into what they think,\nand he knows that they hate him, and he laughs in his sleeve. I will\ntell you what he does. He sets the hawk on against the rat, and the rat\non against the crow, and the crow against the weasel. He tells them all\nsorts of things; so that the weasel thinks the crow tells tales about\nhim, and the hawk thinks the rat has turned tail and betrayed his\nconfidence. The result is, they hate one another as much as they hate\nhim.\n\n\"And he told the rook--it was very clever of him to do so, yes, it was\nvery clever of him, I must admit that Kapchack is extremely clever--that\nif he was not king somebody else would be, perhaps the hawk, or the rat.\nNow the rook told his friends at the rookery, and they told everybody\nelse, and when people came to talk about it, they said it was very true.\nIf Kapchack was not king, perhaps the hawk would be, and he would be as\nbad, or worse; or the rat, and he would be very much worse; or perhaps\nthe weasel, the very worst of all.\n\n\"So they agreed that, rather than have these, they would have Kapchack\nas the least evil. When the hawk and the rat heard what the king had\nsaid, they hated each other ten times more than before, lest\nKapchack--if ever he should give up the crown--should choose one or\nother of them as his successor, for that was how they understood the\nhint. Not that there is the least chance of his giving up the crown; not\nhe, my dear, and he will never die, as everybody knows (here the toad\nwinked slightly), and he will never grow any older; all he does is to\ngrow wiser, and wiser, and wiser, and wiser. All the other birds die,\nbut Kapchack lives for ever. Long live the mighty Kapchack!\" said the\ntoad very loud, that all might hear how loyal he was, and then went on\nspeaking lower. \"Yet the hawk, and the crow, and the rook, and the jay,\nand all of them, though they hate Kapchack in their hearts, all come\nround him bowing down, and they peck the ground where he has just\nwalked, and kiss the earth he has stood on, in token of their humility\nand obedience to him. Each tries to outdo the rest in servility. They\nbring all the news to the palace, and if they find anything very nice in\nthe fields, they send a message to say where it is, and leave it for\nhim, so that he eats the very fat of the land.\"\n\n\"And where is his palace?\" asked Bevis. \"I should like to go and see\nhim.\"\n\n\"His palace is up in an immense old apple-tree, dear. It is a long way\nfrom here, and it is in an orchard, where nobody is allowed to go. And\nthis is the strangest part of it all, and I have often wondered and\nthought about it months together; once I thought about it for a whole\nyear, but I cannot make out why it is that the owner of the orchard, who\nlives in the house close by it, is so fond of Kapchack. He will not let\nanybody go into the orchard unless with him. He keeps it locked (there\nis a high wall around), and carries the key in his pocket.\n\n\"As the orchard is very big, and Kapchack's nest is in the middle, no\none can see even it from the outside, nor can any boys fling a stone and\nhit it; nor, indeed, could any one shoot at it, because the boughs are\nall round it. Thus Kapchack's palace is protected with a high wall, by\nthe boughs, by its distance from the outside, by lock and key, and by\nthe owner of the orchard, who thinks more of him than of all the world\nbesides. He will not let any other big birds go into the orchard at all,\nunless Kapchack seems to like it; he will bring out his gun and shoot\nthem. He watches over Kapchack as carefully as if Kapchack were his son.\nAs for the cats he has shot for getting into the orchard, there must\nhave been a hundred of them.\n\n\"So that Kapchack every year puts a few more sticks on his nest, and\nbrings up his family in perfect safety, which is what no other bird can\ndo, neither the rook, nor the hawk, nor the crow, nor could even the\nraven, when he lived in this country. This is a very great advantage to\nKapchack, for he has thus a fortress to retreat to, into which no one\ncan enter, and he can defy everybody; and this is a great help to him as\nking. It is also one reason why he lives so long, though perhaps there\nis another reason, which I cannot, really I dare not, even hint at; it\nis such a dreadful secret, I should have my head split open with a peck\nif I even so much as dared to think it. Besides which, perhaps it is not\ntrue.\n\n\"If it were not so far, and if there was not a wall round the orchard, I\nwould tell you which way to go to find the place. His palace is now so\nbig he can hardly make it any bigger lest it should fall; yet it is so\nfull of treasures that it can barely hold them all. There are many who\nwould like to rob him, I know. The crow is one; but they dare not\nattempt it, not only for fear of Kapchack, but because they would\ncertainly be shot.\n\n\"Everybody talks about the enormous treasure he has up there, and\neverybody envies him. But there are very dark corners in his palace,\ndark and blood-stained, for, as I told you, his family history is full\nof direful deeds. Besides killing his uncle, and, as is whispered,\nseveral of his children, because he suspected them of designs upon his\nthrone, he has made away with a great many of his wives, I should think\nat least twenty. So soon as they begin to get old and ugly they\ndie--people pretend the palace is not healthy to live in, being so\nancient, and that that is the reason. Though doubtless they are very\naggravating, and very jealous. Did you hear who it was Kapchack was in\nlove with?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bevis. \"The starling flew away before I could ask him, and as\nfor the rest they are so busy telling one another they will not answer\nme.\"\n\n\"One thing is very certain,\" said the toad, \"if Kapchack is in love you\nmay be sure there will be some terrible tragedy in the palace, for his\nwife will be jealous, and besides that his eldest son and heir will not\nlike it. Prince Tchack-tchack is not a very good temper--Tchack-tchack\nis his son, I should tell you--and he is already very tired of waiting\nfor the throne. But it is no use his being tired, for Kapchack does not\nmean to die. Now, Bevis dear, I have told you everything I can think of,\nand I am tired of sitting at the mouth of this hole, where the sunshine\ncomes, and must go back to sleep.\n\n\"But if you want to know anything about the present state of things (as\nI can only tell you what happened a long time since) you had better go\nand call on the squirrel, and say I sent you, and he will inform you. He\nis about the best fellow I know; it is true he will sometimes bite when\nhe is very frisky, it is only his play, but you can look sharp and put\nyour hands in your pockets. He is the best of them all, dear; better\nthan the fox, or the weasel, or the rat, or the stoat, or the mouse, or\nany of them. He knows all that is going on, because the starlings, who\nare extremely talkative, come every night to sleep in the copse where he\nlives, and have a long gossip before they go to sleep; indeed, all the\nbirds go to the copse to chat, the rooks, the wood-pigeons, the\npheasant, and the thrush, besides the rabbits and the hares, so that\nthe squirrel, to whom the copse belongs, hears everything.\"\n\n\"But I do not know my way to the copse,\" said Bevis; \"please tell me the\nway.\"\n\n\"You must go up to the great oak-tree, dear,\" said the toad, \"where you\nonce went to sleep, and then go across to the wheat-field, and a little\nfarther you will see a footpath, which will take you to another field,\nand you will see the copse on your right. Now the way into the copse is\nover a narrow bridge, it is only a tree put across the ditch, and you\nmust be careful how you cross it, and hold tight to the hand-rail, and\nlook where you put your feet. It is apt to be slippery, and the ditch\nbeneath is very deep; there is not much water, but a great deal of mud.\nI recollect it very well, though I have not been there for some time: I\nslipped off the bridge one rainy night in the dark, and had rather a\nheavy fall. The bridge is now dry, and therefore you can pass it easily\nif you do not leave go of the hand-rail. Good-morning, dear, I feel so\nsleepy--come and tell me with whom Kapchack has fallen in love; and\nremember me to the squirrel.\" So saying the toad went back into his hole\nand went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE SQUIRREL.\n\n\nAll this talking had passed away the morning, but in the afternoon, when\nthe sun got a little lower, and the heat was not quite so great, Bevis,\nwho had not been allowed to go out at noon, came forth again, and at\nonce started up the Home Field. He easily reached the great oak-tree,\nand from there he knew his way to the corner of the wheat-field, where\nhe stopped and looked for the hare, but she was not there, nor did she\nanswer when he called to her. At the sound of his voice a number of\nsparrows rose from the wheat, which was now ripening, and flew up to the\nhedge, where they began to chatter about Kapchack's love affair.\n\nBevis walked on across the field, and presently found a footpath; he\nfollowed this, as the toad had instructed him, and after getting over\ntwo stiles there was the copse on the right, though he had to climb over\na high gate to get into the meadow next to it. There was nothing in the\nmeadow except a rabbit, who turned up his white tail and went into his\nhole, for having seen Bevis with the hare, whom he did not like, the\nrabbit did not care to speak to Bevis. When Bevis had crossed the meadow\nhe found, just as the toad had said, that there was a very deep ditch\nround the copse, but scarcely any water in it, and that was almost\nhidden with weeds.\n\nAfter walking a little way along the ditch he saw the tree which had\nbeen cut down and thrown across for a bridge. It was covered with moss,\nand in the shadow underneath it the hart's-tongue fern was growing.\nRemembering what the toad had told him, Bevis put his hand on the\nrail--it was a willow pole--but found that it was not very safe, for at\nthe end the wasps (a long time ago) had eaten it hollow, carrying away\nthe wood for their nests, and what they had left had become rotten.\nStill it was enough to steady his footsteps, and taking care that he did\nnot put his foot on a knot, Bevis got across safely. There was a rail to\nclimb over on the other side, and then he was in the copse, and began to\nwalk down a broad green path, a road which wound in among the ash-wood.\n\nNobody said anything to him, it was quite silent, so silent, that he\ncould hear the snap of the dragon-fly's wing as he stopped in his swift\nflight and returned again. Bevis pulled a handful of long green rushes,\nand then he picked some of the burrs from the tall burdocks; they stuck\nto his fingers when he tried to fling them away, and would not go. The\ngreat thistles were ever so far above his head, and the humble-bees on\nthem glanced down at him as he passed. Bevis very carefully looked at\nthe bramble-bushes to see how the blackberries were coming on; but the\nberries were red and green, and the flowers had not yet all gone. There\nwas such a beautiful piece of woodbine hanging from one of the ash-poles\nthat he was not satisfied till he had gathered some of it; the long\nbrome-grass tickled his face while he was pulling at the honeysuckle.\n\nHe clapped his hands when he found some young nuts; he knew they were\nnot ripe, but he picked one and bit it with his teeth, just to feel how\nsoft it was. There were several very nice sticks, some of which he had\nhalf a mind to stay and cut, and put his hand in his pocket for his\nknife, but there were so many things to look at, he thought he would go\non a little farther, and come back and cut them presently. The ferns\nwere so tall and thick in many places that he could not see in among the\ntrees. When he looked back he had left the place where he came in so far\nbehind that he could not see it, nor when he looked round could he see\nany daylight through the wood; there was only the sky overhead and the\ntrees and ash-stoles, and bushes, and thistles, and long grass, and fern\nall about him.\n\nBevis liked it very much, and he ran on and kicked over a bunch of tawny\nfungus as he went, till by-and-by he came to a piece of timber lying on\nthe ground, and sat down upon it. Some finches went over just then; they\nwere talking about Kapchack as they flew; they went so fast he could not\nhear much. But the squirrel was nowhere about; he called to him, but no\none answered, and he began to think he should never find him, when\npresently, while he sat on the timber whistling very happily, something\ncame round the corner, and Bevis saw it was the hare.\n\nShe ran up to him quickly, and sat down at his feet, and he stroked her\nvery softly. \"I called for you at the wheat-field,\" he said, \"but you\nwere not there.\"\n\n\"No, dear,\" said the hare, \"the truth is, I have been waiting for ever\nso long to come into the copse on a visit to an old friend, but you must\nknow that the weasel lives here.\"\n\n\"Does the weasel live here?\" said Bevis, starting up. \"Tell me where,\nand I will kill him; I will cut off his head with my knife.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you exactly where he lives,\" said the hare, \"but it is\nsomewhere in the copse. It is of no use your looking about; it is in\nsome hole or other, quite hidden, and you would never find it. I am\nafraid to come into the copse while he is here; but this afternoon the\ndragon-fly brought me word that the weasel had gone out. So I made haste\nto come while he was away, as I had not seen my old friend the squirrel\nfor ever so long, and I wanted to know if the news was true.\"\n\n\"Do you mean about Kapchack?\" said Bevis. \"I came to see the squirrel\ntoo, but I cannot find him.\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean about Kapchack,\" said the hare. \"Is it not silly of him to\nfall in love at his age? Why, he must be ten times as old as me! Really,\nI some times think that the older people get the sillier they are. But\nit is not much use your looking for the squirrel, dear. He may be up in\nthe fir-tree, or he may be in the beech, or he may have gone along the\nhedge. If you were by yourself, the best thing you could do would be to\nsit still where you are, and he would be nearly sure to come by, sooner\nor later. He is so restless, he goes all over the copse, and is never\nvery long in one place. Since, however, you and I have met, I will find\nhim for you, and send him to you.\"\n\n\"How long shall you be?\" said Bevis. \"I am tired of sitting here now,\nand I shall go on along the path.\"\n\n\"Oh, then,\" said the hare, \"I shall not know where to find you, and that\nwill not do. Now, I know what I will do. I will take you to the\nraspberries, and there you can eat the fruit till I send the squirrel.\"\n\nThe hare leapt into the fern, and Bevis went after her. She led him in\nand out, and round the ash-stoles and bushes, till he had not the least\nidea which way he was going. After a time, they came to an immense\nthicket of bramble and thorn, and fern growing up in it, and honeysuckle\nclimbing over it.\n\n\"It is inside this thicket,\" said the hare. \"Let us go all round, and\nsee if we can find a way in.\"\n\nThere was a place under an ash-stole, where Bevis could just creep\nbeneath the boughs (the boughs held up the brambles), and after going on\nhis hands and knees after the hare a good way, he found himself inside\nthe thicket, where there was an open space grown over with raspberry\ncanes. Bevis shouted with delight as he saw the raspberries were ripe,\nand began to eat them at once.\n\n\"How ever did they get here?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think it was the thrush,\" said the hare. \"It was one of the birds, no\ndoubt. They take the fruit out of the orchards and gardens, and that was\nhow it came here, I daresay. Now, don't you go outside the thicket till\nthe squirrel comes. And when you have quite done talking to the\nsquirrel, ask him to show you the way back to the timber, and there I\nwill meet you, and lead you to the wheat-field, where you can see the\noak-tree, and know your way home. Mind you do not go outside the thicket\nwithout the squirrel, or you will lose your way, and wander about among\nthe trees till it is night.\"\n\nOff went the hare to find the squirrel, and Bevis set to work to eat as\nmany of the raspberries as he could.\n\nAmong the raspberry canes he found three or four rabbit-holes, and\nhearing the rabbits talking to each other, he stooped down to listen.\nThey were talking scandal about the hare, and saying that she was very\nnaughty, and rambled about too much. At this Bevis was very angry, and\nstamped his foot above the hole, and told them they ought to be ashamed\nof themselves for saying such things. The rabbits, very much frightened,\nwent down farther into their holes. After which Bevis ate a great many\nmore raspberries, and presently, feeling very lazy, he lay down on some\nmoss at the foot of an oak-tree, and kicked his heels on the ground, and\nlooked up at the blue sky, as he always did when he wanted some one to\nspeak to. He did not know how long he had been gazing at the sky, when\nhe heard some one say: \"Bevis dear!\" and turning that way he saw the\nsquirrel, who had come up very quietly, and was sitting on one of the\nlower branches of the oak close to him.\n\n\"Well, squirrel,\" said Bevis, sitting up; \"the toad said I was to\nremember him to you. And now be very quick, and tell me all you know\nabout Kapchack, and who it is he is in love with, and all about the\nrebel, Choo Hoo, and everything else, in a minute.\"\n\n\"Well, you are in a hurry,\" said the squirrel, laughing; \"and so am I,\ngenerally; but this afternoon I have nothing to do, and I am very glad\nyou have come, dear. Now, first----\"\n\n\"First,\" said Bevis, interrupting, \"why did the starling say it was a\ngreat secret, when everybody knew it?\"\n\n\"It was a great secret,\" said the squirrel, \"till Prince Tchack-tchack\ncame down here (he is the heir, you know) in a dreadful fit of temper,\nand told the tomtit whom he met in the fir-tree, and the tomtit told the\nwoodpecker, and the woodpecker told the starling, who told his lady-love\non the chimney, and the fly heard him, and when you opened the window\nthe fly went out and buzzed it to everybody while you were at breakfast.\nBy this time it is all over the world; and I daresay even the sea-gulls,\nthough they live such a long way off, have heard it. Kapchack is beside\nhimself with rage that it should be known, and Tchack-tchack is afraid\nto go near him. He made a great peck at Tchack-tchack just now.\"\n\n\"But why should there be so much trouble about it?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the squirrel, \"it is a very serious business, let me tell\nyou. It is not an ordinary falling in love, it is nothing less than a\ncomplete revolution of everything, and it will upset all the rules and\nlaws that have been handed down ever since the world began.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Bevis. \"And who is it Kapchack is in love with? I have\nasked twenty people, but no one will tell me.\"\n\n\"Why, I am telling you,\" said the squirrel. \"Don't you see, if it had\nbeen an ordinary affair--only a young magpie--it would not have mattered\nmuch, though I daresay the queen would have been jealous, but this----\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" said Bevis, in a rage. \"Why don't you tell me who it is?\"\n\n\"I am telling you,\" said the squirrel, sharply.\n\n\"No, you're not. You're telling me a lot of things, but not what I want\nto know.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the squirrel, tossing his head and swishing his tail,\n\"of course, if you know more about it than I do it is no use my\nstaying.\" So off he went in a pet.\n\nUp jumped Bevis. \"You're a stupid donkey,\" he shouted, and ran across to\nthe other side, and threw a piece of stick up into an elm-tree after the\nsquirrel. But the squirrel was so quick he could not see which way he\nhad gone, and in half-a-minute he heard the squirrel say very softly:\n\"Bevis dear,\" behind him, and looked back, and there he was sitting on\nthe oak bough again.\n\nThe squirrel, as the toad had said, was really a very good fellow; he\nwas very quick to take offence, but his temper only lasted a minute.\n\"Bevis dear,\" he said, \"come back and sit down again on the moss, and I\nwill tell you.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't come back,\" said Bevis, rather sulkily. \"I shall sit here.\"\n\n\"No, no; don't stop there,\" said the squirrel, very anxiously. \"Don't\nstop there, dear; can't you see that great bough above you; that\nelm-tree is very wicked, and full of malice, do not stop there, he may\nhurt you.\"\n\n\"Pooh! what rubbish!\" said Bevis; \"I don't believe you. It is a very\nnice elm, I am sure. Besides, how can he hurt me? He has got no legs and\nhe can't run after me, and he has no hands and he can't catch me. I'm\nnot a bit afraid of him;\" and he kicked the elm with all his might.\nWithout waiting a second, the squirrel jumped down out of the oak and\nran across and caught hold of Bevis by his stocking--he could not catch\nhold of his jacket--and tried to drag him away. Seeing the squirrel in\nsuch an excited state, Bevis went with him to please him, and sat down\non the moss under the oak. The squirrel went up on the bough, and Bevis\nlaughed at him for being so silly.\n\n\"Ah, but my dear Sir Bevis,\" said the squirrel, \"you do not know all, or\nyou would not say what you did. You think because the elm has no legs\nand cannot run after you, and because he has no hands and cannot catch\nyou, that therefore he cannot do you any harm. You are very much\nmistaken; that is a very malicious elm, and of a very wicked\ndisposition. Elms, indeed, are very treacherous, and I recommend you to\nhave nothing to do with them, dear.\"\n\n\"But how could he hurt me?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"He can wait till you go under him,\" said the squirrel, \"and then drop\nthat big bough on you. He has had that bough waiting to drop on somebody\nfor quite ten years. Just look up and see how thick it is, and heavy;\nwhy, it would smash a man out flat. Now, the reason the elms are so\ndangerous is because they will wait so long till somebody passes. Trees\ncan do a great deal, I can tell you; why, I have known a tree, when it\ncould not drop a bough, fall down altogether when there was not a breath\nof wind, nor any lightning, just to kill a cow or a sheep, out of sheer\nbad temper.\"\n\n\"But oaks do not fall, do they?\" asked Bevis, looking up in some alarm\nat the oak above him.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the squirrel; \"the oak is a very good tree, and so is the\nbeech and the ash, and many more (though I am not quite certain of the\nhorse-chestnut, I have heard of his playing tricks), but the elm is not;\nif he can he will do something spiteful. I never go up an elm if I can\nhelp it, not unless I am frightened by a dog or somebody coming along.\nThe only fall I ever had was out of an elm.\n\n\"I ran up one in a hurry, away from that wretch, the weasel (you know\nhim), and put my foot on a dried branch, and the elm, like a treacherous\nthing as he is, let it go, and down I went crash, and should have hurt\nmyself very much if my old friend the ivy had not put out a piece for me\nto catch hold of, and so just saved me. As for you, dear, don't you ever\nsit under an elm, for you are very likely to take cold there, there is\nalways a draught under an elm on the warmest day.\n\n\"If it should come on to rain while you are out for a walk, be sure and\nnot go under an elm for shelter if the wind is blowing, for the elm, if\nhe possibly can, will take advantage of the storm to smash you.\n\n\"And elms are so patient, they will wait sixty or seventy years to do\nsomebody an injury; if they cannot get a branch ready to fall they will\nlet the rain in at a knot-hole, and so make it rotten inside, though it\nlooks green without, or ask some fungus to come up and grow there, and\nso get the bough ready for them. That elm across there is quite rotten\ninside--there is a hole inside so big you could stand up, and yet if\nanybody went by they would say what a splendid tree.\n\n\"But if you asked Kauhaha, the rook, he would shake his head, and\ndecline to have anything to do with that tree. So, my dear Sir Bevis, do\nnot you think any more that because a thing has no legs, nor arms, nor\neyes, nor ears, that therefore it cannot hurt you. There is the earth,\nfor instance; you may stamp on the earth with your feet and she will not\nsay anything, she will put up with anything, but she is always lying in\nwait all the same, and if you could only find all the money she has\nburied you would be the richest man in the world; I could tell you\nsomething about that. The flints even----\"\n\n\"Now I do not believe what you are going to say,\" said Bevis, \"I am sure\nthe flints cannot do anything, for I have picked up hundreds of them and\nflung them splash into the brook.\"\n\n\"But I assure you they can,\" said the squirrel. \"I will tell you a story\nabout a flint that happened only a short time since, and then you will\nbelieve. Once upon a time a waggon was sent up on the hills to fetch a\nload of flints; it was a very old waggon, and it wanted mending, for it\nbelonged to a man who never would mend anything.\"\n\n\"Who was that?\" said Bevis. \"What a curious man.\"\n\n\"It was the same old gentleman (he is a farmer, only he is like your\npapa, Sir Bevis, and his land is his own), the same old gentleman who is\nso fond of Kapchack, whose palace is in his orchard. Well, the waggon\nwent up on the hills, where the men had dug up some flints which had\nbeen lying quite motionless in the ground for so many thousand years\nthat nobody could count them. There were at least five thousand flints,\nand the waggon went jolting down the hill and on to the road, and as it\nwent the flints tried to get out, but they could not manage it, none but\none flint, which was smaller than the rest.\n\n\"This one flint, of all the five thousand, squeezed out of a hole in the\nbottom of the waggon, and fell on the dust in the road, and was left\nthere. There was not much traffic on the road (it is the same, dear,\nthat goes to Southampton, where the ships are), so that it remained\nwhere it fell. Only one waggon came by with a load of hay, and had the\nwheel gone over the flint of course it would have been crushed to\npieces. But the waggoner, instead of walking by his horses, was on the\ngrass at the side of the road talking to a labourer in the field, and\nhis team did not pass on their right side of the road, but more in the\nmiddle, and so the flint was not crushed.\n\n\"In the evening, when it was dark, a very old and very wealthy gentleman\ncame along in his dog-cart, and his horse, which was a valuable one,\nchanced to slip on the flint, which, being sharp and jagged, hurt its\nhoof, and down the horse fell. The elderly gentleman and his groom, who\nwas driving, were thrown out; the groom was not hurt, but his master\nbroke his arm, and the horse broke his knees. The gentleman was so angry\nthat no sooner did he get home than he dismissed the groom, though it\nwas no fault of his, for how could he see the flint in the night? Nor\nwould he give the man a character, and the consequence was he could not\nfind another place. He soon began to starve, and then he was obliged to\nsteal, and after a while he became a burglar.\n\n\"One night he entered a house in London, and was getting on well, and\nstealing gold watches and such things, when somebody opened the door\nand tried to seize him. Pulling out his pistol, he shot his assailant\ndead on the spot, and at once escaped, and has not since been heard of,\nthough you may be sure if he is caught he will be hung, and they are\nlooking very sharp after him, because he stole a box with some papers in\nit which are said to be of great value. And the person he shot was the\nsame gentleman who had discharged him because the horse fell down. Now\nall this happened through the flint, and as I told you, Bevis dear,\nabout the elm, the danger with such things is that they will wait so\nlong to do mischief.\n\n\"This flint, you see, waited so many years that nobody could count them,\ntill the waggon came to fetch it. They are never tired of waiting. Be\nvery careful, Bevis dear, how you climb up a tree, or how you put your\nhead out of window, for there is a thing that is always lying in wait,\nand will pull you down in a minute, if you do not take care. It has been\nwaiting there to make something fall ever since the beginning of the\nworld, long before your house was built, dear, or before any of the\ntrees grew. You cannot see it, but it is there, as you may prove by\nputting your cap out of window, which in a second will begin to fall\ndown, as you would if you were tilted out.\n\n\"And I daresay you have seen people swimming, which is a very pleasant\nthing, I hear from the wild ducks; but all the time the water is lying\nin wait, and if they stop swimming a minute they will be drowned, and\nalthough a man very soon gets tired of swimming, the water never gets\ntired of waiting, but is always ready to drown him.\n\n\"Also, it is the same with your candle, Bevis dear, and this the bat\ntold me, for he once saw it happen, looking in at a window as he flew\nby, and he shrieked as loud as he could, but his voice is so very shrill\nthat it is not everybody can hear him, and all his efforts were in vain.\nFor a lady had gone to sleep in bed and left her candle burning on the\ndressing-table, just where she had left it fifty times before, and found\nit burnt down to the socket in the morning, and no harm done. But that\nnight she had had a new pair of gloves, which were wrapped up in a piece\nof paper, and she undid these gloves and left the piece of paper\nunderneath the candlestick, and yet it would not have hurt had the\ncandle been put up properly, but instead of that a match had been stuck\nin at the side, like a wedge, to keep it up. When the flame came down to\nthe match the match caught fire, and when it had burnt a little way\ndown, that piece fell off, and dropped on the paper in which the gloves\nhad been wrapped. The paper being very thin was alight in an instant,\nand from the paper the flame travelled to some gauze things hung on the\nlooking-glass, and from that to the window curtains, and from the window\ncurtains to the bed curtains, till the room was in a blaze, and though\nthe bat shrieked his loudest the lady did not wake till she was very\nmuch burnt.\n\n\"Also with the sea; for the cod-fish told the seagull, who told the\nheron, who related the fact to the kingfisher, who informed me. The\ncod-fish was swimming about in the sea and saw a ship at anchor, and\ncoming by the chain-cable the fish saw that one of the links of the\nchain was nearly eaten through with rust; but as the wind was calm it\ndid not matter. Next time the ship came there to anchor the cod-fish\nlooked again; and the rust had gone still further into the link. A third\ntime the ship came back to anchor there, and the sailors went to sleep\nthinking it was all right, but the cod-fish swam by and saw that the\nlink only just held. In the night there came a storm, and the sailors\nwoke up to find the vessel drifting on the rocks, where she was broken\nto pieces, and hardly any of them escaped.\n\n\"Also, with living things, Bevis dear; for there was once a little\ncreeping thing (the sun-beetle told me he heard it from his grandfather)\nwhich bored a hole into a beam under the floor of a room--the hole was\nso tiny you could scarcely see it, and the beam was so big twenty men\ncould not lift it. After the creeping thing had bored this little hole\nit died, but it left ten children, and they bored ten more little holes,\nand when they died they left ten each, and they bored a hundred holes,\nand left a thousand, and they bored a thousand holes, and they left a\nthousand tens, who bored ten thousand holes, and left ten thousand tens,\nand they bored one hundred thousand holes, and left one hundred thousand\ntens, and they bored a million holes; and when a great number of people\nmet in the room to hear a man speak, down the beam fell crash, and they\nwere all dreadfully injured.\n\n\"Now, therefore, Bevis, my dear little Sir Bevis, do you take great care\nand never think any more that a thing cannot hurt you, because it has\nnot got any legs, and cannot run after you, or because it has no hands,\nand cannot catch you, or because it is very tiny, and you cannot see it,\nbut could kill a thousand with the heel of your boot. For as I told you\nabout the malice-minded elm, all these things are so terribly dangerous,\nbecause they can wait so long, and because they never forget.\n\n\"Therefore, if you climb up a tree, be sure and remember to hold tight,\nand not forget, for the earth will not forget, but will pull you down to\nit thump, and hurt you very much. And remember if you walk by the water\nthat it is water, and do not forget, for the water will not forget, and\nif you should fall in, will let you sink and drown you. And if you take\na candle be careful what you are doing, and do not forget that fire will\nburn, for the fire will not forget, but will always be on the look-out\nand ready, and will burn you without mercy. And be sure to see that no\nlittle unseen creeping thing is at work, for they are everywhere boring\nholes into the beam of life till it cracks unexpectedly; but you must\nstay till you are older, and have eaten the peck of salt your papa tells\nyou about, before you can understand all that. Now----\"\n\n\"But,\" said Bevis, who had been listening to the story very carefully,\n\"you have not told me about the wind. You have told me about the earth,\nand the water, and the fire, but you have not said anything about the\nwind.\"\n\n\"No more I have,\" said the squirrel. \"You see I forget, though the earth\ndoes not, neither does the water, nor the fire. Well, the wind is the\nnicest of all of them, and you need never be afraid of the wind, for he\nblows so sweetly, and brings the odour of flowers, and fills you with\nlife, and joy, and happiness. And oh, Bevis dear, you should listen to\nthe delicious songs he sings, and the stories he tells as he goes\nthrough the fir-tree and the oak. Of course if you are on the ground, so\nfar below, you can only hear a sound of whispering, unless your ears are\nvery sharp; but if you were up in the boughs with me, you would be\nenchanted with the beauty of his voice.\n\n\"No, dear, never be afraid of the wind, but put your doors open and let\nhim come in, and throw your window open and let him wander round the\nroom, and take your cap off sometimes, and let him stroke your hair. The\nwind is a darling--I love the wind, and so do you, dear, for I have seen\nyou racing about when the wind was rough, chasing the leaves and\nshouting with delight. Now with the wind it is just the reverse to what\nit is with all the others. If you fall on the earth it thumps you; into\nthe water, it drowns you; into the fire, it burns you; but you cannot do\nwithout wind.\n\n\"Always remember that you must have wind, dear, and do not get into a\ndrawer, as I have heard of boys doing, from the mouse, who goes about a\ngood deal indoors, and being suffocated for want of wind; or into a\nbox, or a hole, or anywhere where there is no wind. It is true he\nsometimes comes along with a most tremendous push, and the trees go\ncracking over. That is only because they are malice-minded, and are\nrotten at the heart; and the boughs break off, that is only because they\nhave invited the fungus to grow on them; and the thatch on your papa's\nricks is lifted up at the corner just as if the wind had chucked them\nunder the chin.\n\n\"But that is nothing. Everybody loses his temper now and then, and why\nnot the wind? You should see the nuts he knocks down for me where I\ncould not very well reach them, and the showers of acorns, and the\napples! I take an apple out of your orchard, dear, sometimes, but I do\nnot mean any harm--it is only one or two. I love the wind! But do not go\nnear an elm, dear, when the wind blows, for the elm, as I told you, is a\nmalicious tree, and will seize any pretence, or a mere puff, to do\nmischief.\"\n\n\"I love the wind too!\" said Bevis. \"He sings to me down the chimney, and\nhums to me through the door, and whistles up in the attic, and shouts at\nme from the trees. Oh, yes, I will do as you say; I will always have\nplenty of the wind. You are a very nice squirrel. I like you very much;\nand you have a lovely silky tail. But you have not told me yet who it is\nKapchack is in love with.\"\n\n\"I have been telling you all the time,\" said the squirrel; \"but you are\nin such a hurry; and, as I was saying, if it was only a young magpie,\nnow--only an ordinary affair--very likely the queen would be jealous,\nindeed, and there would be a fight in the palace, which would be nothing\nat all new, but this is much more serious, a very serious matter, and\nnone can tell how it will end. As Kauc, the crow, was saying to Cloctaw,\nthe jackdaw, this morning----\"\n\n\"But who is it?\" asked Bevis, jumping up again in a rage.\n\n\"Why, everybody knows who it is,\" said the squirrel; \"from the ladybird\nto the heron; from the horse to the mouse; and everybody is talking of\nit, and as since the raven went away, there is no judge to settle any\ndispute----\"\n\n\"I hate you!\" said Bevis, \"you do talk so much; but you do not tell me\nwhat I want to know. You are a regular donkey, and I will pull your\ntail.\"\n\nHe snatched at the squirrel's tail, but the squirrel was too quick; he\njumped up the boughs and showed his white teeth, and ran away in a\ntemper.\n\nBevis looked all round, but could not see him, and as he was looking a\ndragon-fly came and said that the squirrel had sent him to say that he\nwas very much hurt, and thought Bevis was extremely rude to him, but he\nhad told the dragon-fly to show him the way to the piece of timber, and\nif he would come back to-morrow, and not be so rude, he should hear all\nabout it. So the dragon-fly led Bevis to the piece of timber, where the\nhare was waiting, and the hare led him to the wheat-field, and showed\nhim the top of the great oak-tree, and from there he easily found his\nway home to tea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE COURTIERS.\n\n\nThe next morning passed quickly, Bevis having so much to do. Hur-hur,\nthe pig, asked him to dig up some earth-nuts for him with his knife, for\nthe ground was hard from the heat of the sun, and he could not thrust\nhis snout in. Then Pan, the spaniel, had to be whipped very severely\nbecause he would not climb a tree; and so the morning was taken up.\nAfter the noontide heat had decreased, Bevis again started, and found\nhis way by the aid of the oak to the corner of the wheat-field. The\ndragon-fly was waiting for him with a message from the hare, saying that\nshe had been invited to a party on the hills, so the dragon-fly would\nguide him into the copse.\n\nFlying before him, the dragon-fly led the way, often going a long\ndistance ahead, and coming back in a minute, for he moved so rapidly it\nwas not possible for Bevis to keep pace with him, and he was too\nrestless to stand still. Bevis walked carefully over the bridge, holding\nto the rail, as the toad had told him; and passing the thistles, and the\ngrass, and the ferns, came to the piece of timber. There he sat down to\nrest, while the dragon-fly played to and fro, now rising to the top of\nthe trees, and now darting down again, to show off his dexterity. While\nhe was sitting there a crow came along and looked at him hard, but said\nnothing; and immediately afterwards a jackdaw went over, remarking what\na lovely day it was.\n\n\"Now take me to the raspberries,\" said Bevis; and the dragon-fly,\nwinding in and out the trees, brought him to the thicket, showed him the\nplace to creep in, and left, promising to return by-and-by and fetch him\nwhen it was time to go home. Bevis, warm with walking in the sunshine,\nafter he had crept in to the raspberries, went across and sat down on\nthe moss under the oak; and he had hardly leant his back against the\ntree than the squirrel came along the ground and sat beside him.\n\n\"You are just in time, my dear,\" he said, speaking low and rapidly, and\nglancing round to see that no one was near; \"for there is going to be a\nsecret council of the courtiers this afternoon, while Kapchack takes his\nnap; and in order that none of the little birds may play the spy and\ncarry information to the police, Kauc, the crow, has been flying round\nand driving them away, so that there is not so much as a robin left in\nthe copse. This is an employment that suits him very well, for he loves\nto play the tyrant. Perhaps you saw him coming in. And this council is\nabout Kapchack's love affair, and to decide what is to be done, and\nwhether it can be put up with, or whether they must refuse to receive\nher.\"\n\n\"And who is she?\" said Bevis; \"you keep on talking, but you do not tell\nme.\" The squirrel pricked up his ears and looked cross, but he heard\nthe people coming to the council, and knew there was no time to be lost\nin quarrelling, so he did not go off in a pet this time. \"The lady is\nthe youngest jay, dear, in the wood; La Schach is her name; she is\nsweetly pretty, and dresses charmingly in blue and brown. She is sweetly\npretty, though they say rather a flirt, and flighty in her ways. She has\ncaptivated a great many with her bright colour, and now this toothless\nold Kapchack--but hush! It is a terrible scandal. I hear them coming;\nslip this way, Bevis dear.\"\n\nBevis went after him under the brambles and the ferns till he found a\nplace in a hollow ash-stole, where it was hung all round with\nhoneysuckle, and then, doing as the squirrel told him, he sat down, and\nwas quite concealed from sight; while the squirrel stopped on a bough\njust over his head, where he could whisper and explain things. Though\nBevis was himself hidden, he could see very well; and he had not been\nthere a minute before he heard a rustling, and saw the fox come\nstealthily out from the fern, and sit under an ancient hollow pollard\nclose by.\n\nThe stoat came close behind him; he was something like the weasel, and\nthey say a near relation; he is much bolder than the weasel, but not one\nquarter so cunning. He is very jealous, too, of the power the weasel has\ngot on account of his cunning, and if he could he would strangle his\nkinsman. The rat could not attend, having very important business at the\nbrook that day, but he had sent the mouse to listen and tell him all\nthat was said. The fox looked at the mouse askance from the corner of\nhis eye; and the stoat could not refrain from licking his lips, though\nit was well understood that at these assemblies all private feelings\nwere to be rigidly suppressed. So that the mouse was quite safe; still,\nseeing the fox's glance, and the stoat's teeth glistening, he kept very\nnear a little hole under a stole, where he could rush in if alarmed.\n\n\"I understood Prince Tchack-tchack was coming,\" said the fox, \"but I\ndon't see him.\"\n\n\"I heard the same thing,\" said the stoat. \"He's very much upset about\nthis business.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the fox, \"perhaps he had an eye himself to this beautiful\nyoung creature. Depend upon it there's more under the surface than we\nhave heard of yet.\" Just then a message came from the weasel regretting\nvery much that he could not be present, owing to indisposition, but\nsaying that he quite agreed with all that was going to be said, and that\nhe would act as the others decided, and follow them in all things. This\nmessage was delivered by a humble-bee, who having repeated all the\nweasel had told him to, went buzzing on among the thistles.\n\n\"I do not quite like this,\" said a deep hollow voice; and looking up,\nBevis saw the face of the owl at the mouth of a hole in the\npollard-tree. He was winking in the light, and could not persuade\nhimself to come out, which was the reason the council was held at the\nfoot of his house, as it was necessary he should take part in it. \"I do\nnot quite like this,\" said the owl, very solemnly, \"Is the weasel\nsincere in all he says? Is he really unwell, or does he keep away in\norder that if Kapchack hears of this meeting he may say: 'I was not\nthere. I did not take any part in it'?\"\n\n\"That is very likely,\" said the stoat. \"He is capable of anything--I say\nit with sorrow, as he is so near a relation, but the fact is, gentlemen,\nthe weasel is not what he ought to be, and has, I am afraid, much\ndisgraced our family.\"\n\n\"Let us send for the weasel,\" said the hawk, who just then came and\nalighted on the tree above the owl. \"Perhaps the squirrel, who knows the\ncopse so well, will go and fetch him.\"\n\n\"I really do not know where he lives,\" said the squirrel. \"I have not\nseen him lately, and I am afraid he is keeping his bed.\" Then the\nsquirrel whispered down to Bevis: \"That is not all true, but you see I\nam obliged not to know too much, else I should offend somebody and do\nmyself no good\".\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the rook, who had just arrived, \"send the mouse; he\nlooks as if he wanted something to do.\"\n\n\"I cannot agree to that,\" said the owl; \"the mouse is very clever, and\nhis opinion worthy of attention; we cannot spare him.\" The truth was,\nthe owl, squinting down, had seen what a plump mouse it was, and he\nreflected that if the weasel saw him he would never rest till he had\ntasted him, whereas he thought he should like to meet the mouse by\nmoonlight shortly. \"Upon the whole, I really don't know that we need\nsend for the weasel,\" he went on, thinking that if the weasel came he\nwould fasten his affections upon the mouse.\n\n\"But I do,\" said the stoat.\n\n\"And so do I,\" said the fox.\n\n\"And I,\" said Kauc, the crow, settling down on a branch of the pollard.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Cloctaw, the old jackdaw, taking his seat on a\nbranch of horse-chestnut, \"I think it is very disrespectful of the\nweasel.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the wood-pigeon. \"True-whoo,\" as he settled on the ash.\n\n\"Quite true-oo,\" repeated the dove, perching in the hawthorn.\n\n\"Send for the weasel, then,\" said a missel-thrush, also perching in the\nhawthorn. \"Why all this delay? I am for action. Send for the weasel\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Really, gentlemen,\" said the mouse, not at all liking the prospect of a\nprivate interview with the weasel, \"you must remember that I have had a\nlong journey here, and I am not quite sure where the weasel lives at\npresent.\"\n\n\"The council is not complete without the weasel,\" screamed a jay, coming\nup; he was in a terrible temper, for the lady jay whom Kapchack was in\nlove with had promised him her hand, till the opportunity of so much\ngrandeur turned her head, and she jilted him like a true daughter of the\nfamily, as she was. For the jays are famous for jilting their lovers.\n\"If the mouse is afraid,\" said the jay, \"I'll fetch the humble-bee\nback, and if he won't come I'll speak a word to my friend the shrike,\nand have him spitted on a thorn in a minute.\" Off he flew, and the\nhumble-bee, dreadfully frightened, came buzzing back directly.\n\n\"It falls upon you, as the oldest of the party, to give him his\ncommands,\" said Tchink, the chaffinch, addressing the owl. The owl\nlooked at the crow, and the crow scowled at the chaffinch, who turned\nhis back on him, being very saucy. He had watched his opportunity while\nthe crow went round the copse to drive away the small birds, and slipped\nin to appear at the council. He was determined to assert his presence,\nand take as much part as the others in these important events. If the\ngoldfinches, and the thrushes, and blackbirds, and robins, and\ngreenfinches, and sparrows, and so on, were so meek as to submit to be\nexcluded, and were content to have no voice in the matter till they were\ncalled upon to obey orders, that was their affair. They were a bevy of\npoor-spirited, mean things. He was not going to be put down like that.\nTchink was, indeed, a very impudent fellow: Bevis liked him directly,\nand determined to have a chat with him by-and-by.\n\n\"If I am the oldest of the party, it is scarcely competent for you to\nsay so,\" said the owl with great dignity, opening his eyes to their full\nextent, and glaring at Tchink.\n\n\"All right, old Spectacles,\" said Tchink; \"you're not a bad sort of\nfellow by daylight, though I have heard tales of your not behaving quite\nso properly at night.\" Then catching sight of Bevis (for Tchink was\nvery quick) he flew over and settled near the squirrel, intending, if\nany violence was offered to him, to ask Bevis for protection.\n\nThe owl, seeing the fox tittering, and the crow secretly pleased at this\nremark, thought it best to take no notice, but ordered the humble-bee,\nin the name of the council, to at once proceed to the weasel, and inform\nhim that the council was unable to accept his excuses, but was waiting\nhis arrival.\n\n\"Is Tchack-tchack coming?\" asked the mouse, recovering his spirits now.\n\n\"I too-whoo should like to know if Tchack-tchack is coming,\" said the\nwood-pigeon.\n\n\"And I so, too-oo,\" added the dove. \"It seems to me a most important\nmatter.\"\n\n\"In my opinion,\" said Cloctaw, speaking rather huskily, for he was very\nold, \"Tchack-tchack will not come. I know him well--I can see through\nhim--he is a double-faced rascal like--like (he was going to say the\nfox, but recollected himself in time) his--well, never matter; like all\nhis race then. My opinion is, he started the rumour that he was coming\njust to get us together, and encourage us to conspire against his\nfather, in the belief that the heir was with us and approved of our\nproceedings. But he never really meant to come.\"\n\n\"The jackdaw is very old,\" said the crow, with a sneer. \"He is not what\nhe used to be, gentlemen, you must make allowance for his\ninfirmities.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said the missel-thrush, interrupting, \"that we are\nwasting a great deal of time. I propose that we at once begin the\ndiscussion, and then if the weasel and Tchack-tchack come they can join\nin. I regret to say that my kinsman, the missel-thrush who frequents the\norchard (by special permission of Kapchack, as you know), is not here.\nThe pampered fawning wretch!--I hate such favourites--they disgrace a\ncourt. Why, all the rest of our family are driven forth like rogues, and\nare not permitted to come near! If the tyrant kills his children in his\nwanton freaks even then this minion remains loyal: despicable being! But\nnow without further delay let us ask the owl to state the case plainly,\nso that we can all understand what we are talking about.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said Tchink.\n\n\"I agree too,\" said the wood-pigeon.\n\n\"I too,\" said the dove.\n\n\"It is no use waiting for Tchack-tchack,\" said the hawk.\n\n\"Hum! haw! caw!\" said the rook, \"I do not know about that.\"\n\n\"Let us go on to business,\" said the stoat, \"the weasel knows no more\nthan we do. His reputation is much greater than he deserves.\"\n\n\"I have heard the same thing,\" said the fox. \"Indeed I think so myself.\"\n\n\"I am sure the owl will put the case quite fairly,\" said the mouse, much\npleased that the owl had saved him from carrying the message to the\nweasel.\n\n\"_We_ are all waiting, Owl,\" said Tchink.\n\n\"_We_, indeed,\" said the hawk, very sharply.\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said the squirrel. \"This is a privileged place, gentlemen;\nno personal remarks, if you please.\"\n\n\"I think, think, the owl is very stupid not to begin,\" said the\nchaffinch.\n\n\"If you please,\" said the fox, bowing most politely to the owl, \"we are\nlistening.\"\n\n\"Well then, gentlemen, since you all wish it,\" said the owl, ruffling\nout his frills and swelling up his feathers, \"since you all wish it, I\nwill endeavour to put the case as plainly as possible, and in as few\nwords as I can. You must understand, gentlemen, indeed you all\nunderstand already, that from time immemorial, ever since the oak bore\nacorns, and the bramble blackberries, it has been the established custom\nfor each particular bird and each particular animal to fall in love\nwith, and to marry some other bird or animal of the same kind.\n\n\"To explain more fully, so that there cannot by any possibility be the\nleast chance of any one mistaking my meaning, I should illustrate the\nposition in this way, that it has always been the invariable custom for\nowls to marry owls; for crows to marry crows; for rooks to fall in love\nwith rooks; for wood-pigeons to woo wood-pigeons; doves to love doves;\nmissel-thrushes to court lady missel-thrushes; jackdaws, jackdaws;\nhawks, hawks; rats, rats; foxes, foxes; stoats, stoats; weasels,\nweasels; squirrels, squirrels; for jays to marry jays ('Just so,'\nscreamed the jay); and magpies to marry magpies.\"\n\n\"And chaffinches to kiss chaffinches,\" added Tchink, determined not to\nbe left out.\n\n\"This custom,\" continued the owl, \"has now existed so long, that upon\nlooking into the archives of my house, and turning over the dusty\nrecords, not without inconvenience to myself, I can't discover one\nsingle instance of a departure from it since history began. There is no\nrecord, gentlemen, of any such event having taken place. I may say,\nwithout fear of contradiction, that no precedent exists. We may,\ntherefore, regard it as a fixed principle of common law, from which no\ndeparture can be legal, without the special and express sanction of all\nthe nation, or of its representatives assembled. We may even go further,\nand hazard the opinion, not without some authority, that even with such\nsanction, such departure from constitutional usage could not be\nsustained were an appeal to be lodged.\n\n\"Even the high court of representatives of all the nation, assembled in\nthe fulness of their power, could not legalise what is in itself and of\nits own nature illegal. Customs of this kind, which are founded upon the\ninnate sense and feeling of every individual, cannot, in short, be\nabolished by Act of Parliament. Upon this all the authorities I have\nconsulted are perfectly agreed. What has grown up during the process of\nso many generations, cannot be now put on one side. This, gentlemen, is\nrather an abstruse part of the question, being one which recommends\nitself for consideration to the purely legal intellect. It is a matter,\ntoo, of high state policy which rises above the knowledge of the common\nherd. We may take it for granted, and pass on from the general to the\nspecial aspect of this most remarkable case.\n\n\"What do we see? We see a proposed alliance between an august magpie and\na beautiful jay. Now we know by experience that what the palace does one\nday, the world at large will do to-morrow. It is the instinct of nature\nto follow the example of those set so high above us. We may therefore\nconclude, without fear of contradiction, that this alliance will be\nfollowed by others equally opposed to tradition. We shall have hundreds\nof other equally ill-assorted unions. If it could be confined to this\none instance, a dispensation might doubtless be arranged. I, for one,\nshould not oppose it. ('I hate you!' shouted the jay.) But no one can\nfor a moment shut his eye to what must happen. We shall have, as I\nbefore remarked, hundreds of these ill-assorted unions.\n\n\"Now I need not enlarge upon the unhappy state of affairs which would\nthus be caused: the family jars, the shock to your feelings, the pain\nthat must be inflicted upon loving hearts. With that I have nothing to\ndo. It may safely be left to your imagination. But what I, as a\nstatesman and a lawyer, have to deal with, is the legal, that is the\ncommon-sense view of the situation, and my first question is this: I ask\nmyself, and I beg you, each of you, to ask yourselves--I ask myself,\nWhat effect would these ill-assorted unions produce upon the inheritance\nof property?\"\n\n\"True-whoo!\" said the wood-pigeon.\n\n\"Hum! Haw!\" said the rook.\n\n\"Law-daw!\" said Cloctaw.\n\n\"Very important, very!\" said the fox. \"The sacred laws of property\ncannot with safety be interfered with.\"\n\n\"No intrusion can be thought of for a moment,\" said the stoat.\n\n\"Most absurd!\" said the jay.\n\n\"The very point!\" said the missel-thrush.\n\n\"Very clear, indeed!\" said the mouse; \"I am sure the rat will echo the\nsentiment.\"\n\n\"Every one will agree with you,\" said Ki Ki, the hawk.\n\n\"I think the same,\" said the chaffinch.\n\n\"The question is undoubtedly very important,\" continued the owl, when\nthe buzz had subsided, and much pleased at the sensation he had caused.\n\"You all agree that the question is not one to be lightly decided or\npassed over. In order to fully estimate the threatened alteration in our\npresent system, let us for a moment survey the existing condition of\naffairs. I, myself, to begin with, I and my ancestors, for many\ngenerations, have held undisputed possession of this pollard. Not the\nslightest flaw has ever been discovered in our title-deeds; and no\nclaimant has ever arisen. The rook has had, I believe, once or twice\nsome little difficulty respecting his own particular tenancy, which is\nnot a freehold; but his townsmen, as a body, possess their trees in\npeace. The crow holds an oak; the wood-pigeon has an ash; the\nmissel-thrush a birch; our respected friend the fox here, has a burrow\nwhich he inherited from a deceased rabbit, and he has also contingent\nclaims on the witheybed, and other property in the country; the stoat\nhas a charter of free warren.\"\n\n\"And I have an elm,\" said Tchink; \"let anybody come near it, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"The squirrel,\" continued the owl, \"has an acknowledged authority over\nthis copse; and the jay has three or four firs of his own.\"\n\n\"And St. Paul belongs to me,\" said Cloctaw, the jackdaw.\n\n\"Well, now,\" said the owl, raising his voice and overpowering the husky\nCloctaw, \"about these various properties little or no dispute can take\nplace; the son succeeds to the father, and the nephew to the uncle.\nOccasional litigation, of course, occurs, which I have often had the\npleasure of conducting to an amicable and satisfactory termination. But,\nupon the whole, there is very little difficulty; and the principle of\ninheritance is accepted by all. Your approval, indeed, has just been\nsignified in the most unanimous manner. But what shall we see if the\nexample set by the palace spreads among society? The ash at the present\nmoment is owned by the wood-pigeon; were the wood-pigeon's heir to marry\nthe missel-thrush's heiress, just imagine the conflicting claims which\nwould arise.\n\n\"The family would be divided amongst itself; all the relations upon the\npaternal side, and the relations upon the maternal side would join the\ncontest, and peace would be utterly at an end. And so in all other\ninstances. The crow would no longer have a fee-simple of the oak, the\njackdaw of the steeple, the rook of the elm, the fox of the burrow, or I\nof my pollard. We might even see the rook claiming the----But I will not\nfollow the illustration further, lest I be charged with descending to\npersonalities. I will only add, in conclusion, that if this ill-fated\nunion takes place, we must look forward to seeing every home broken up,\nour private settlements, our laws of hereditary succession set upon one\nside, our property divided among a miscellaneous horde of people, who\nwill not know their own grandfathers, and our most cherished sentiments\ncast to the winds of heaven.\" With which words the owl concluded, and\nwas greeted with marks of approval from all parts of the circle.\n\n\"We are all very much indebted to the owl,\" said the fox, \"for putting\nthe true aspect of the case so clearly before us. His learned\ndiscourse--not more learned than lucid--has convinced us all of the\nextreme inexpediency of this alliance.\"\n\n\"If this course is persisted in,\" said the crow, \"it can only end, in my\nopinion, in a way disastrous to the state. The king cannot decline to\nlisten to our representations, if we are united.\"\n\n\"Haw!\" said the rook; \"I'm not so sure of that. Kapchack likes his own\nway.\"\n\n\"Kapchack is very self-willed,\" said the hawk. \"It is almost our turn to\nhave our way once now.\"\n\n\"So I should say,\" screamed the jay, who could never open his beak\nwithout getting into a temper. \"So I should say; Kapchack is a wicked\nold----\"\n\n\"Hush, hush,\" said the squirrel; \"you can't tell who may be listening.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" said the jay, ruffling up his feathers; \"Kapchack is a\nwicked old fellow, and Tchack-tchack is as bad.\"\n\n\"Capital!\" said Tchink, the chaffinch; \"I like outspoken people. But I\nhave heard that you (to the jay) are very fond of flirting.\" At this\nthere would have been a disturbance, had not the fox interfered.\n\n\"We shall never do anything, unless we agree amongst ourselves,\" he\nsaid. \"Now, the question is, are we going to do anything?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is it,\" said the missel-thrush, who hated talking, and liked\nto be doing; \"what is it we are going to do?\"\n\n\"Something must be done,\" said the owl, very solemnly.\n\n\"Yes; something must be done,\" said Cloctaw.\n\n\"Something must be done,\" said Ki Ki.\n\n\"I think, think so,\" said Tchink.\n\n\"I, too,\" said the dove.\n\n\"Quite true,\" said the wood-pigeon.\n\n\"Something must be done,\" said the stoat.\n\n\"Let us tell Kapchack what we think,\" said the mouse, getting bold, as\nhe was not eaten.\n\n\"A good idea,\" said the crow; \"a very good idea. We will send the mouse\nwith a message.\"\n\n\"Dear me! No, no,\" cried the mouse, terribly frightened; \"Kapchack is\nawful in a rage--my life would not be worth a minute's purchase. Let the\nstoat go.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said the stoat; \"I have had to suffer enough already, on\naccount of my relation to that rascal the weasel, whom Kapchack suspects\nof designs upon his throne. I will not go.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the fox; \"Kapchack has looked angrily at me for a long\ntime--he cannot forget my royal descent. Let the hawk go.\"\n\n\"I! I!\" said Ki Ki. \"Nonsense; Kapchack does not much like me now; he\ngave me a hint the other day not to soar too high. I suppose he did not\nlike to think of my overlooking him kissing pretty La Schach.\"\n\n\"Wretch! horrid wretch!\" screamed the jay, at the mention of the\nkissing, in a paroxysm of jealousy. \"Pecking is too good for him!\"\n\n\"Send the jackdaw or the crow,\" said Ki Ki.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Kauc and Cloctaw together. \"Try the wood-pigeon.\"\n\n\"I go?--whoo,\" said the pigeon. \"Impossible. Kapchack told me to my face\nthe other day that he more than half suspected me of plotting to go over\nto Choo Hoo. I dare not say such a thing to him.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the dove. \"Why not the owl?\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the owl, \"my relations with Kapchack are of a\npeculiar and delicate nature. Although I occupy the position of a\ntrusted counsellor, and have the honour to be chief secretary of state,\nthat very position forbids my taking liberties, and it is clear if I\ndid, and were in consequence banished from the court, that I could not\nplead your cause. Now, the rat----\"\n\n\"I am sure the rat will not go,\" said the mouse. \"My friend the rat is\nvery particularly engaged, and could not possibly stir from home at this\njuncture. There is the missel-thrush.\"\n\n\"Ridiculous,\" said the missel-thrush. \"Everybody knows I had to leave my\nhawthorn-tree because Prince Tchack-tchack took a fancy to it. He would\nvery likely accuse me to his father of high treason, for he hates me\nmore than poison ever since he did me that injury, and would lose no\nchance of compassing my destruction. Besides which my relative--the\nfavourite--would effectually prevent me from obtaining an audience. Now,\nthere's the squirrel.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said the squirrel, \"it is well known I never meddle with\npolitics. I am most happy to see you all here, and you can have the use\nof my copse at any time, and I may say further that I sympathise with\nyour views in a general way. But on no account could I depart from my\nprinciples.\"\n\n\"His principles,\" muttered the crow, always a cynical fellow. \"His\nprinciples are his own beech-trees. If anybody touched them he would not\nobject to politics then.\"\n\n\"This is rather awkward,\" said the owl. \"There seems an embarrassment on\nthe part of all of us, and we must own that to venture into the presence\nof a despotic monarch with such unpleasant advice requires no slight\ncourage. Now, I propose that since the weasel has attained so high a\nreputation for address, that he be called upon to deliver our message.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said the fox.\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said the stoat.\n\n\"Capital,\" said the chaffinch. \"Old Spectacles can always see a way out\nof a difficulty.\"\n\n\"Haw!\" said the rook. \"I'm doubtful. Perhaps the weasel will not see it\nin this light.\"\n\n\"Buzz,\" said the humble-bee, just then returning. \"Gentlemen, I have\nseen the weasel. His lordship was lying on a bank in the sun--he is very\nill indeed. His limbs are almost powerless; he has taken a chill from\nsleeping in a damp hole. He sends his humble apology, and regrets he\ncannot move. I left him licking his helpless paw. Buzz, buzz.\"\n\n\"Hark! hark!\" said the woodpecker, bursting into the circle with such a\nshout and clatter that the dove flew a little way in alarm. \"Kapchack is\nwaking up. I have been watching all the time to let you know. And there\nis no chance of Prince Tchack-tchack coming, for he told me that\nKapchack ordered him not to leave the orchard while he was asleep.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it,\" said the jay. \"He is a false scoundrel, and I\ndaresay Kapchack never gave any such order, and never thought about it.\nHowever, there is no help for it, we must break up this meeting, or we\nshall be missed. But it is clear that something must be done.\"\n\n\"Something must be done,\" said the wood-pigeon, as he flew off.\n\n\"Something must be done,\" repeated the dove.\n\n\"Something must be done,\" said the owl, as he went down into the pollard\nto sleep the rest of the day. Off went the mouse as fast as he could go,\nanxious to get away from the neighbourhood of the weasel. The\nmissel-thrush had started directly he heard what the woodpecker said,\ndisgusted that there was no action, and nothing but talk. The jay went\noff with the hawk, remarking as he went that he had expected better\nthings of the fox, whose royal ancestors had so great a reputation, and\ncould contrive a scheme to achieve anything, while their ignoble\ndescendant was so quiet, and scarce spoke a word. It seemed as if the\nweasel would soon outdo him altogether. The rook flew straight away to\nthe flock to which he belonged, to tell them all that had been said. The\nchaffinch left at the same time; the fox and the stoat went away\ntogether; the crow and the jackdaw accompanied each other a little way.\nWhen they had gone a short distance the crow said he wanted to say\nsomething very particular, so they perched together on a lonely branch.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Cloctaw.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the crow, \"my belief is--come a little nearer--my\nbelief is that Kapchack's reign is coming to an end. People won't put\nup with this.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the jackdaw, \"if that is the case who is to be king?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the crow, \"let me whisper to you; come a little nearer.\" He\nhopped towards Cloctaw. Cloctaw hopped the other way. The crow hopped\ntowards him again, till Cloctaw came to the end of the branch, and could\ngo no farther without flying, which would look odd under the\ncircumstances. So he kept a very sharp eye on Kauc, for the fact was\nthey had had many a quarrel when they were younger, and Cloctaw was not\nat all sure that he should not have a beak suddenly driven through his\nhead.\n\n\"The truth is,\" said the crow, in a hoarse whisper, \"there's a chance\nfor you and me. Can't you see the fox is very stupid, quite abject, and\nwithout the least spirit; the stoat is very fierce, but has no mind;\neverybody suspects the weasel, and will not trust him; as for the rat,\nhe is no favourite; the hawk is--well, the hawk is dangerous, but might\nbe disposed of ('You black assassin,' thought Cloctaw to himself); the\nrook has not a chance, for his friends would be too jealous to let one\nof their number become a king; and for the rest, they are too weak.\nThere's only you and me left.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Cloctaw; \"but we could not both be king.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said the crow; \"you wear the crown and live in the palace;\nyou are old, and it would be nice and comfortable; you have all the\nstate and dignity, and I will do the work.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to propose it,\" said Cloctaw, as if considering.\nIn his heart he thought: \"Oh, yes, very convenient indeed; I am to wear\nthe crown, and be pecked at by everybody, and _you_ to do all the\nwork--that is, to go about and collect the revenue, and be rich, and\nhave all the power, while I have all the danger\".\n\n\"It is quite feasible, I am sure,\" said the crow; \"especially if Prince\nTchack-tchack continues his undutiful course, and if Choo Hoo should\ncome up with his army.\"\n\n\"I must think about it,\" said Cloctaw; \"we must not be too hasty.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no,\" said the crow, delighted to have won over one important\npolitician to his cause so easily; \"we must wait and watch events. Of\ncourse this little conversation is quite private?\"\n\n\"Perfectly private,\" said Cloctaw; and they parted.\n\nThe crow had an appointment, and Cloctaw flew direct to the steeple. His\nnest was in the highest niche, just behind the image of St. Paul; and it\nwas not only the highest, but the safest from intrusion, for there was\nno window near, and, on account of some projections below, even a ladder\ncould not be put up, so that it was quite inaccessible without\nscaffolding. This niche he discovered in his hot youth, when he won\nrenown by his strength and courage: he chose it for his home, and\ndefended it against all comers. He was now old and feeble, but his\nreputation as a leading politician, and his influence at the court of\nKing Kapchack, were too great for any to think of ousting him by force.\n\nBut the members of his family, in their extreme solicitude for his\npersonal safety, frequently represented to him the danger he incurred in\nascending so high. Should a wing fail him, how terrible the\nconsequences! more especially for the race of which he was so\ndistinguished an ornament. Nor was there the least reason for his\nlabouring to that elevation; with his reputation and influence, none\nwould dare to meddle with him. There were many pleasant places not so\nexposed, as the gurgoyle, the leads, the angle of the roof, where he\ncould rest without such an effort; and upon their part they would\nwillingly assist him by collecting twigs for a new nest.\n\nBut Cloctaw turned a deaf ear to these kindly proposals, and could not\nbe made to see the advantages so benevolently suggested. He would in no\ndegree abate his dignity, his right, power, or position. He adhered to\nSt. Paul. There he had built all his days, and there he meant to stay to\nthe last, for having seen so much of the world, well he knew that\npossession is ten points of the law, and well he understood the envy and\njealousy which dictated these friendly counsels.\n\nAt the same time, as the fox and the stoat were going through the fern,\nthe stoat said: \"It appears to me that this is a very favourable\nopportunity for ruining the weasel. Could we not make up some tale, and\ntell Kapchack how the weasel asked us to a secret meeting, or\nsomething?\"\n\nNow the fox had his own ideas, and he wanted to get rid of the stoat.\n\"Another time,\" he said, \"another time, we will consider of it; but why\nwaste such a capital chance as you have to-day?\"\n\n\"Capital chance to-day?\" said the stoat; \"what is it you mean?\"\n\n\"Did you not see the mouse?\" said the fox. \"Did you not see how fat he\nwas? And just think, he has a long and lonely road home; and it would be\nvery easy to make a short cut (for he will not leave the hedges which\nare round about) and get in front of, and so intercept him. I should go\nmyself, but I was out last night, and feel tired this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" said the stoat; \"I'll run that way directly.\" And off\nhe started, thinking to himself: \"How silly the fox has got, and how\nmuch he has fallen off from the ancient wisdom for which his ancestors\nwere famous. Why ever did he not hold his tongue, and I should never\nhave thought of the mouse, and the fox could have had him another day?\"\n\nBut the fact was the fox recollected that the mouse had had a long\nstart, and it was very doubtful if the stoat could overtake him, and if\nhe did, most likely the rat would come to meet his friend, and the stoat\nwould get the worst of the encounter.\n\nHowever ill the rat served the mouse, however much he abused his\nsuperior strength, wreaking his temper on his weaker companion, still\nthe mouse clung to him all the more. On the other hand the rat, ready\nenough to injure the mouse himself, would allow no one else (unless with\nhis permission) to touch his follower, wishing to reserve to himself a\nmonopoly of tyranny.\n\nSo soon as the stoat was out of sight, the fox looked round to see that\nno one was near, and he said to a fly: \"Fly, will you carry a message\nfor me?\"\n\n\"I am very busy,\" said the fly, \"very busy indeed.\"\n\nSo the fox went a little farther, and said to a humble-bee: \"Humble-bee,\nwill you carry a message for me?\"\n\n\"I am just going home,\" said the humble-bee, and buzzed along.\n\nSo the fox went a little farther, and said to a butterfly: \"Beautiful\nbutterfly, will you carry a message for me?\" But the disdainful\nbutterfly did not even answer.\n\nThe fox went a little farther, and met a tomtit. \"Te-te,\" said he,\naddressing the tomtit by name, \"will you carry a message for me?\"\n\n\"What impudence!\" said Te-te. \"Mind your own business, and do not speak\nto gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I see how it is,\" said the fox to himself, \"the fortunes of my family\nare fallen, and I am disregarded. When we were rich, and had a great\nreputation, and were the first of all the people in the wood, then we\nhad messengers enough, and they flew to do our bidding. But now, they\nturn aside. This is very bitter. When I get home, I must curl round and\nthink about it; I cannot endure this state of things. How dreadful it\nis to be poor! I wish we had not dissipated our wealth so freely.\nHowever, there is a little left still in a secret corner. As I said, I\nmust see about it. Here is a gnat. Gnat, will you carry a message for\nme?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said the gnat; \"I must think about it. Will\nto-morrow do?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the fox quickly, before the gnat flew off. \"Go for me to\nKapchack, and say there has been a secret----\"\n\n\"A secret?\" said the gnat; \"that's another matter.\" And he went down\ncloser to the fox.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the fox, \"you fly as fast as you can, and whisper to\nKapchack--you have free admittance, I know, to the palace--that there\nhas been a secret meeting in the copse about his love affair, and that\nthe courtiers are all against it, and are bent on his destruction,\nespecially the owl, the hawk, the crow, the rook, the weasel (the weasel\nworst of all, for they would have chosen him as their deputy), the\nstoat, and the jackdaw, and that he has only one true friend, the fox,\nwho sends the message.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said the gnat; \"all right, I'll go!\" And off he flew,\ndelighted to be entrusted with so great a secret.\n\nWhile the courtiers were thus intriguing, not only against Kapchack, but\nagainst each other, Bevis and the squirrel went back into the\nraspberries, and Bevis helped himself to the fruit that had ripened\nsince yesterday.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Bevis, after he had eaten as much as he could,\n\"that they are all very wicked.\"\n\n\"So they are,\" said the squirrel. \"I am sorry to say they are rather\ntreacherous, and I warned you not to believe all they said to you. I\nwould not let them use my copse, but the fact is, if they are wicked,\nKapchack is a hundred times more so. Besides, it is very hard on the\njay, who is an old acquaintance of mine--we often have a chat in the\nfir-trees--to have his dear, sweet, pretty lady stolen away from him by\nsuch a horrid old wretch, whose riches and crown have quite turned her\nhead!\"\n\n\"What a business it all is,\" said Bevis. \"Everybody seems mixed up in\nit. And so it is true that Prince Tchack-tchack is also in love with the\npretty jay?\"\n\n\"Yes, that it is,\" said the squirrel; \"and, between you and me, I have\nseen her flirt with him desperately, in that very hawthorn bush he\nforced the missel-thrush to give up to him. And that is the reason he\nwill not let Kapchack peck his eye out, as he is so vain, and likes to\nlook nice.\"\n\n\"Let Kapchack peck his eye out! But Kapchack is his father. Surely his\npapa would not peck his eye out?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said the squirrel, \"I almost let the secret out.\nGoodness! I hope nobody heard me. And pray, Bevis dear, don't repeat\nit--oh, pray don't!--or it will be sure to be traced to me. I wish I had\nnever heard it. If I had not listened to that vile old crow; if I had\nnot been so curious, and overheard him muttering to himself, and\nsuggesting doubts at night! Bevis dear, don't you ever be curious, and\ndon't you say a word.\"\n\nThe squirrel was in a terrible fright, till Bevis promised not to repeat\nanything.\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"you have not told me the secret.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the squirrel, \"but I very nearly did, and only just stopped\nin time. Why, if the trees heard it, they would pass it from one to the\nother in a moment. Dear, dear!\" He sat down, he was so frightened he\ncould not frisk about. But Bevis stroked him down, and soothed him, and\nsaid he had the most lovely silky tail in the world, and this brought\nhim to himself again.\n\n\"All this comes,\" said the squirrel, \"of my having run up the wrong side\nof the tree first this morning. Take care, Bevis dear, that you too do\nnot make a mistake, and put the wrong foot first out of bed when you get\nup.\" Bevis laughed at this, and asked which was his wrong foot. \"Well,\"\nsaid the squirrel, \"the fact is, it depends: sometimes it is one, and\nsometimes it is the other, and that is the difficulty, to know which it\nis, and makes all the difference in life. The very best woman I ever\nknew (and she was a farmer's wife) always, when she was out walking, put\none foot before the other, and so was always right.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Bevis, \"how could she walk without putting one foot\nbefore the other?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the squirrel, \"many people, though they think they put\none foot before the other, really keep the wrong foot foremost all the\ntime. But do you remember to-morrow morning when you get up.\"\n\n\"I do not see what difference it can make,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"If you put one foot out first,\" said the squirrel, \"it will very likely\nlead you to the looking-glass, where you will see yourself and forget\nall the rest, and you will do one sort of thing that day; and if you put\nthe other out first it will lead you to the window, and then you will\nsee something, and you will think about that, and do another sort of\nthing; and if you put both feet out of bed together they will take you\nto the door, and there you will meet somebody, who will say something,\nand you will do another kind of thing. So you see it is a very important\nmatter, and this woman, as I said, was the best that ever lived.\"\n\n\"No she wasn't,\" said Bevis, \"she was not half so good as my mother is.\"\n\n\"That is true, dear,\" said the squirrel. \"Your mother is the very best\nof all. But don't forget about your feet to-morrow morning, dear.\"\n\n\"Look up,\" said Bevis, \"and tell me what bird that is.\"\n\nThe squirrel looked up, and saw a bird going over at a great height.\n\"That is a peewit,\" he said. \"He is a messenger; you can see how fast\nand straight he is flying. He is bringing some news, I feel sure, about\nChoo Hoo. Kapchack sent an out-post of peewits over the hills to watch\nChoo Hoo's movements, and to let him know directly if he began to\ngather his army together. Depend upon it, dear, there is some very\nimportant news. I must tell the woodpecker, and he will find out; he is\nvery clever at that.\" The squirrel began to get restless, though he did\nnot like to tell Bevis to go.\n\n\"You promised to tell me about Choo Hoo,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"So I did,\" said the squirrel, \"and if you will come to-morrow I will do\nso; I am rather in a hurry just now.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bevis, \"I will come to-morrow. Now show me the way to\nthe felled tree.\" As they were going Bevis recollected the weasel, and\nasked if he was really so ill he could not move, but was obliged to lick\nhis paw to cure the pain.\n\nThe squirrel laughed. \"No,\" he whispered; \"don't you say I said so: the\ntruth is, the weasel is as well as you or I, and now the council is\nbroken up I daresay he is running about as quickly as he likes. And,\nBevis dear, stoop down and I'll tell you (Bevis stooped), the fact is,\nhe was at the council all the time.\"\n\n\"But I never saw him,\" said Bevis, \"and he never said anything.\"\n\n\"No,\" whispered the squirrel very quietly, \"he wanted to hear what they\nsaid without being present; he was in the elm all the time; you know,\ndear, that malice-minded elm on the other side of the raspberries, which\nI told you was rotten inside. He lives there in that hole; there is a\nway into it level with the ground; that is his secret hiding-place.\"\n\n\"I will bring my cannon-stick to-morrow,\" said Bevis, delighted to have\ndiscovered where the weasel lived at last, \"and I will shoot into the\nhole and kill him.\"\n\n\"I could not let you do that,\" said the squirrel. \"I do not allow any\nfighting, or killing, in my copse, and that is the reason all the birds\nand animals come here to hold their meetings, because they know it is a\nsanctuary. If you shoot off your cannon the birds are sure to hear it,\nand you will not be present at any more of their meetings, and you will\nnot hear any more of the story. Therefore it would be very foolish of\nyou to shoot off your cannon; you must wait, Bevis dear, till you can\ncatch the weasel outside my copse, and then you may shoot him as much as\nyou like.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bevis, rather sulkily, \"I will not shoot him in the\nhole if you do not want me to. But how could the weasel have been in the\nelm all the time, when the humble-bee said he found him lying in the\nsunshine on a bank licking his paw?\"\n\n\"Why, of course he told the humble-bee to say that.\"\n\n\"What a cheater he is, isn't he?\" said Bevis. \"And how did you find out\nwhere he lived? I looked everywhere for him, and so did Pan--Pan sniffed\nand sniffed, but could not find him.\"\n\n\"Nor could I,\" said the squirrel. \"After you shot the--I mean after the\nunfortunate business with the thrush, he kept out of the way, knowing\nthat you had vowed vengeance against him, and although I go about a\ngood deal, and peep into so many odd corners, I could not discover his\nwhereabouts, till the little tree-climber told me. You know the\ntree-climber, dear, you have seen him in your orchard at home; he goes\nall round and round the trees, and listens at every chink, and so he\nlearns almost all the secrets. He heard the weasel in the elm, and came\nat once and told me. Here is the timber, and there is the dragon-fly.\nGood-afternoon, Bevis dear; come to-morrow, and you shall hear the\npeewit's news, and be sure and not forget to put the right foot out of\nbed first in the morning.\" Bevis kissed his hand to the squirrel, and\nwent home with the dragon-fly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE EMPEROR CHOO HOO.\n\n\nWhen he woke next morning, Bevis quite forgot what the squirrel had told\nhim; he jumped out of bed without thinking, and his right foot touched\nthe floor first, and led him to the window. From the window he saw the\nbrook, and recollected that the brook had promised to tell him what he\nwas singing, so as soon as ever he could get out of doors away he went\nthrough the gateway the grasshopper had shown him, and down to the\nhatch. Instead of coming quietly on tip-toe, as the brook had told him,\nhe danced up, and the kingfisher heard him, and went off as before,\nwhistling: \"Weep, weep\". Bevis stood on the brink and said: \"Brook,\nBrook, what are you singing? You promised to tell me what you were\nsaying.\"\n\nThe brook did not answer, but went on singing. Bevis listened a minute,\nand then he picked a willow leaf and threw it into the bubbles, and\nwatched it go whirling round and round in the eddies, and back up under\nthe fall, where it dived down, and presently came up again, and the\nstream took it and carried it away past the flags. \"Brook, Brook,\" said\nBevis, stamping his foot, \"tell me what you are singing.\"\n\nAnd the brook, having now finished that part of his song, said: \"Bevis\ndear, sit down in the shadow of the willow, for it is very hot to-day,\nand the reapers are at work; sit down under the willow, and I will tell\nyou as much as I can remember.\"\n\n\"But the reed said you could not remember anything,\" said Bevis, leaning\nback against the willow.\n\n\"The reed did not tell you the truth, dear; indeed, he does not know\nall; the fact is, the reeds are so fond of talking that I scarcely ever\nanswer them now, or they would keep on all day long, and I should never\nhear the sound of my own voice, which I like best. So I do not encourage\nthem, and that is why the reeds think I do not recollect.\"\n\n\"And what is that you sing about?\" said Bevis, impatiently.\n\n\"My darling,\" said the brook, \"I do not know myself always what I am\nsinging about. I am so happy I sing, sing, and never think about what it\nmeans; it does not matter what you mean as long as you sing. Sometimes I\nsing about the sun, who loves me dearly, and tries all day to get at me\nthrough the leaves and the green flags that hide me; he sparkles on me\neverywhere he can, and does not like me to be in the shadow. Sometimes I\nsing to the wind, who loves me next most dearly, and will come to me\neverywhere, in places where the sun cannot get. He plays with me\nwhenever he can, and strokes me softly, and tells me the things he has\nheard in the woods and on the hills, and sends down the leaves to float\nalong, for he knows I like something to carry. Fling me in some leaves,\nBevis dear.\n\n\"Sometimes I sing to the earth and the grass; they are fond of me too,\nand listen the best of all. I sing loudest at night, to the stars, for\nthey are so far away they would not otherwise hear me.\"\n\n\"But what do you say?\" said Bevis; but the brook was too occupied now to\nheed him, and went on.\n\n\"Sometimes I sing to the trees; they, too, are fond of me, and come as\nnear as they can; they would all come down close to me if they could.\nThey love me like the rest, because I am so happy, and never cease my\nchanting. If I am broken to pieces against a stone, I do not mind in the\nleast; I laugh just the same, and even louder. When I come over the\nhatch, I dash myself to fragments; and sometimes a rainbow comes and\nstays a little while with me. The trees drink me, and the grass drinks\nme, the birds come down and drink me; they splash me, and are happy. The\nfishes swim about, and some of them hide in deep corners. Round the bend\nI go, and the osiers say they never have enough of me. The long grass\nwaves and welcomes me; the moor-hens float with me; the kingfisher is\nalways with me somewhere, and sits on the bough to see his ruddy breast\nin the water. And you come too, Bevis, now and then to listen to me; and\nit is all because I am so happy.\"\n\n\"Why are you so happy?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the brook. \"Perhaps it is because all I think of\nis this minute; I do not know anything about the minute just gone by,\nand I do not care one bit about the minute that is just coming; all I\ncare about is this minute, this very minute now. Fling me in some more\nleaves, Bevis. Why do you go about asking questions, dear? Why don't you\nsing, and do nothing else?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I want to know all about everything,\" said Bevis. \"Where did\nyou come from, and where are you going, and why don't you go on and let\nthe ground be dry--why don't you run on, and run all away? Why are you\nalways here?\"\n\nThe brook laughed, and said: \"My dear, I do not know where I came from,\nand I do not care at all where I am going. What does it matter, my love?\nAll I know is I shall come back again; yes, I shall come back again.\"\nThe brook sang very low, and rather sadly now: \"I shall go into the sea,\nand shall be lost; and even you would not know me--ask your father,\nlove, he has sailed over the sea in the ships that come to Southampton,\nand I was close to him, but he did not know me. But by-and-by, when I am\nin the sea, the sun will lift me up, and the clouds will float\nalong--look towards the hills, Bevis dear, every morning, and you will\nsee the clouds coming and bringing me with them; and the rain and the\ndew, and sometimes the thunder and the lightning, will put me down\nagain, and I shall run along here and sing to you, my sweet, if you will\ncome and listen. Fling in some little twigs, my dear, and some bits of\nbark from the tree.\"\n\nThen the brook sang very low and very sad, and said: \"I shall come back\nagain, Bevis; I always come back, and I am always happy; and yet I do\nnot know either if I am really happy when I am singing so joyously.\nBevis dear, try and think and tell me. Am I really happy, Bevis? Tell\nme, dear; you can see the sun sparkling on me, and the wind stroking me,\njust as he strokes your hair (he told me he was very fond of you, and\nmeant to tell you a story some day), and the reeds whispering, and the\nwillows drooping over me, and the bright kingfisher; you can hear me\nsinging, Bevis, now am I happy?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Bevis; \"sometimes you sound very happy, but just\nnow you sound very sad. Stop a little while and think about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Bevis; I cannot stop, I must keep running. Nothing can stop,\ndear: the trees cannot stop growing, they must keep on growing till they\ndie; and then they cannot stop decaying, till they are all quite gone;\nbut they come back again. Nor can you stop, Bevis dear.\"\n\n\"I will stop,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"You cannot,\" said the brook.\n\n\"But I will.\"\n\n\"You cannot. You are a very clever boy, Bevis, but you cannot stop; nor\ncan your papa, nor anybody, you must keep on. Let me see, let me think.\nI remember, I have seen you before; it was so many, many thousand years\nago, but I am almost sure it was you. Now I begin to think about it, I\nbelieve I have seen you two or three times, Bevis; but it was before the\nhippopotamus used to come and splash about in me. I cannot be quite\ncertain, for it is a long time to remember your face, dear.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it,\" said Bevis; \"you are babbling, Brook. My mamma\nsays you babble--it is because you are so old. I am sure I was not born\nthen.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were, dear; and I daresay you will come back again, when all\nthe hills are changed and the roads are covered with woods, and the\nhouses gone. I daresay you will come back again and splash in me, like\nthe blackbirds.\"\n\n\"Now you are talking nonsense, you silly Brook,\" said Bevis; \"the hills\nwill never change, and the roads will always be here, and the houses\nwill not be gone: but why are you sighing, you dear old Brook?\"\n\n\"I am sighing, my love, because I remember.\"\n\n\"What do you remember?\"\n\n\"I remember before the hills were like they are now; I remember when I\nwas a broad deep river; I remember the stars that used to shine in me,\nand they are all gone, you cannot see them now, Bevis ('Pooh,' said\nBevis); I remember the stories the lions used to tell me when they came\ndown to drink; I remember the people dancing on the grass by me, and\nsing, singing; they used to sing like me, Bevis, without knowing what it\nwas they sung, and without any words (not stupid songs, Bevis, like your\npeople sing now), but I understood them very well. I cannot understand\nthe songs the folk sing now, the folk that live now have gone away so\nfar from me.\"\n\n\"What nonsense you say, old Brook; why, we live quite close, and the\nwaggons go over your bridge every day.\"\n\n\"I remember (the brook took no notice, but went on), I remember them\nvery well, and they loved me dearly too; they had boats, Bevis, made out\nof trees, and they floated about on me.\"\n\n\"I will have a boat,\" said Bevis, \"and float about on you.\"\n\n\"And they played music, which was just like my singing, and they were\nvery happy, because, as I told you about myself, they did not think\nabout the minute that was coming, or the minute that had gone by, they\nonly thought about this minute.\"\n\n\"How long was that ago?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the brook, \"I daresay your papa would tell you it was\nthousands upon thousands of years, but that is not true, dear; it was\nonly a second or two since.\"\n\n\"I shall not stay to listen much longer, silly Brook, if you talk like\nthat; why, it must be longer than that, or I should have seen it.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said the brook, \"that which has gone by, whether it happened\na second since, or a thousand thousand years since, is just the same;\nthere is no real division betwixt you and the past. You people who live\nnow have made up all sorts of stupid, very stupid stories, dear; I hope\nyou will not believe them; they tell you about time and all that. Now\nthere is no such thing as time, Bevis my love; there never was any time,\nand there never will be; the sun laughs at it, even when he marks it on\nthe sun-dial. Yesterday was just a second ago, and so was ten thousand\nyears since, and there is nothing between you and then; there is no wall\nbetween you and then--nothing at all, dear,\"--and the brook sang so low\nand thoughtfully that Bevis could not catch what he said, but the tune\nwas so sweet, and soft, and sad that it made him keep quite still. While\nhe was listening the kingfisher came back and perched on the hatch, and\nBevis saw his ruddy neck and his blue wings.\n\n\"There is nothing between you and then,\" the brook began again, \"nothing\nat all, dear; only some stories which are not true; if you will not\nbelieve me, look at the sun, but you cannot look at the sun, darling; it\nshines so bright. It shines just the same, as bright and beautiful; and\nthe wind blows as sweet as ever, and I sparkle and sing just the same,\nand you may drink me if you like; and the grass is just as green; and\nthe stars shine at night. Oh, yes, Bevis dear, _we_ are all here just\nthe same, my love, and all things are as bright and beautiful as ten\nthousand times ten thousand years ago, which is no longer since than a\nsecond.\n\n\"But your people have gone away from us--that is their own fault. I\ncannot think why they should do so; they have gone away from us, and\nthey are no longer happy, Bevis; they cannot understand our songs--they\nsing stupid songs they have made up themselves, and which they did not\nlearn of us, and then because they are not happy, they say: 'The world\nis growing old'. But it is not true, Bevis, the world is not old, it is\nas young as ever it was. Fling me a leaf--and now another. Do not you\nforget me, Bevis; come and see me now and then, and throw twigs to me\nand splash me.\"\n\n\"That I will,\" said Bevis; and he picked up a stone and flung it into\nthe water with such a splash that the kingfisher flew away, but the\nbrook only laughed, and told him to throw another, and to make haste and\neat the peck of salt, and grow bigger and jump over him. \"That I will,\"\nsaid Bevis, \"I am very hungry now--good-morning, I am going home to\ndinner.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, dear,\" said the brook, \"you will always find me here when\nyou want to hear a song.\" Bevis went home to dinner humming the tune the\nbrook had taught him, and by-and-by, when the hot sun had begun to sink\na little, he started again for the copse, and as before the dragon-fly\nmet him, and led him to the timber, and from there to the raspberries.\n\nThe squirrel was waiting for him on a bough of the oak, and while Bevis\npicked the fruit that had ripened since yesterday, told him the news the\npeewits had brought about the great rebel Choo Hoo. A party of the\npeewits, who had been watching ever so far away, thought they saw a stir\nand a movement in the woods; and presently out came one of the captains\nof the wood-pigeons with two hundred of his soldiers, and they flew over\nthe border into King Kapchack's country and began to forage in one of\nhis wheat-fields, where the corn was ripe. When they saw this, the\npeewits held a council on the hill, and they sent a messenger to\nKapchack with the news. While they were waiting for him to return, some\nof the wood-pigeons, having foraged enough, went home to the woods, so\nthat there was not much more than half of them left.\n\nSeeing this--for his soldiers who were wheeling about in the air came\nand told him--the captain of the peewits thought: \"Now is my time! This\nis a most lucky and fortunate circumstance, and I can now win the high\napproval of King Kapchack, and obtain promotion. The captain of the\nwood-pigeons has no idea how many of us are watching his proceedings,\nfor I have kept my peewits behind the cover of the hill so that he could\nnot count them, and he has allowed half of the wood-pigeons to go home.\nWe will rush down upon the rest, and so win an easy victory.\"\n\nSo saying he flew up, and all the peewits followed him in the\nexpectation of an easy conquest. But, just as they were descending upon\nthe wheat-field, up flew the wood-pigeons with such a terrible clangour\nof their strong wings, and facing towards them, showed such a\ndetermination to fight to the last breath, that the peewits, who were\nnever very celebrated for their courage, turned tail, and began to\nretreat.\n\nThey would still have reached the hills in good order, and would have\nsuffered no great disgrace (for they were but a small party, and not so\nnumerous as the wood-pigeons), but in the midst of these manoeuvres,\nthe lieutenant of the pigeons, who had gone home with those who had done\nforaging, flew out from the wood with his men, and tried by a flank\nmovement to cut off the peewits' retreat. At this they were so alarmed\nthey separated and broke up their ranks, each flying to save himself as\nbest he might. Nor did they stop till long after the wood-pigeons, being\ncautious and under complete control, had ceased to pursue; not till they\nhad flown back two or three miles into the fastnesses of Kapchack's\nhills. Then some of them, collecting again, held a hurried council, and\nsent off messengers with the news of this affray.\n\nAbout the same time, it happened that a missel-thrush arrived at the\ncourt, a son of the favourite missel-thrush, the only bird whom Kapchack\n(and the farmer) allowed to build in the orchard. The missel-thrush had\njust travelled through part of the country which once belonged to\nKapchack, but which Choo Hoo had over-run the year before, and he\nbrought Kapchack such a terrible account of the mighty armies that he\nsaw assembling, that the king was beside himself with terror. Next came\na crow, one of Kauc's warriors, who had been that way, and he said that\ntwo captains of the wood-pigeons, hearing of the peewits' defeat, had\nalready, and without staying for instructions from Choo Hoo, entered the\ncountry and taken possession of a copse on the slope of the hill from\nwhich the peewits had descended.\n\n\"And,\" said the squirrel, as Bevis, having eaten all the raspberries,\ncame and sat down on the moss under the oak, \"the upshot of it is that\nKing Kapchack has called a general council of war, which is to be held\nalmost directly at the owl's castle, in the pollard hard by. For you\nmust understand that the farmer who lives near Kapchack's palace is so\nfierce, he will not let any of the large birds (except the favourite\nmissel-thrush) enter the orchard, and therefore Kapchack has to hold\nthese great councils in the copse. What will be the result I cannot\nthink, and I am not without serious apprehensions myself, for I have\nhitherto held undisputed possession of this domain. But Choo Hoo is so\ndespotic, and has such an immense army at his back, that I am not at all\ncertain he will respect my neutrality. As for Kapchack, he shivers in\nhis claws at the very name of the mighty rebel.\"\n\n\"Why does Choo Hoo want King Kapchack's country?\" said Bevis. \"Why\ncannot he stop where he is?\"\n\n\"There is no reason, dear; but you know that all the birds and animals\nwould like to be king if they could, and when Choo Hoo found that the\nwood-pigeons (for he was nothing but an adventurer at first, without any\ntitle or property except the ancestral ash) were growing so numerous\nthat the woods would hardly hold them, and were continually being\nincreased both by their own populousness and by the arrival of fresh\nbands, it occurred to him that this enormous horde of people, if they\ncould only be persuaded to follow him, could easily over-run the entire\ncountry. Hitherto, it was true, they had been easily kept in subjection,\nnotwithstanding their immense numbers, first, because they had no\nleaders among them, nor even any nobles or rich people to govern their\nmovements and tell them what to do; and next, because they were\nbarbarians, and totally destitute of art or refinement, knowledge, or\nscience, neither had they any skill in diplomacy or politics, but were\nutterly outside the civilised nations.\n\n\"Even their language, as you yourself have heard, is very contracted and\npoor, without inflection or expression, being nothing but the repetition\nof the same sounds, by which means--that is simply by the number and the\ndepth of hollowness of the same monosyllables--they convey their wishes\nto each other. It is, indeed, wonderful how they can do so, and our\nlearned men, from this circumstance, have held that the language of the\nwood-pigeon is the most difficult to acquire, so much so that it is\nscarce possible for one who has not been born among the barbarians to\nattain to any facility in the use of these gutturals. This is the reason\nwhy little or no intercourse has ever taken place between us who are\ncivilised and these hordes; that which has gone on has been entirely\nconducted by the aid of interpreters, being those few wood-pigeons who\nhave come away from the main body, and dwell peaceably in our midst.\n\n\"Now, Choo Hoo, as I said, being an adventurer, with no more property\nthan the ancestral ash, but a pigeon of very extraordinary genius,\nconsidered within himself that if any one could but persuade these\nmighty and incredible myriads to follow him he could over-run the entire\ncountry. The very absence of any nobles or rich pigeons among them would\nmake his sway the more absolute if he once got power, for there would\nbe none to dispute it, or to put any check upon him. Ignorant and\nbarbarous as they were, the common pigeons would worship such a captain\nas a hero and a demi-god, and would fly to certain destruction in\nobedience to his orders.\n\n\"He was the more encouraged to the enterprise because it was on record\nthat in olden times great bodies of pigeons had passed across the\ncountry sweeping everything before them. Nothing could resist their\nonward march, and it is owing to these barbarian invasions that so many\nof our most precious chronicles have been destroyed, and our early\nhistory, Bevis dear, involved in obscurity. Their dominion--destructive\nas it was--had, however, always passed away as rapidly as it arose, on\naccount of the lack of cohesion in their countless armies. They marched\nwithout a leader, and without order, obeying for a time a common\nimpulse; when that impulse ceased they retired tumultuously, suffering\ngrievous losses from the armies which gathered behind and hung upon\ntheir rear. Their bones whitened the fields, and the sun, it is said,\nwas darkened at noonday by their hastening crowds fleeing in dense\ncolumns, and struck down as they fled by hawks and crows.\n\n\"Had they possessed a leader in whom they felt confidence the result\nmight have been very different; indeed, our wisest historians express no\ndoubt that civilisation must have been entirely extinguished, and these\nlovely fields and delicious woods have been wholly occupied by the\nbarbarians. Fortunately it was not so. But, as I said, Choo Hoo,\nretiring to the top of a lofty fir-tree, and filled with these ideas,\nsurveyed from thence the masses of his countrymen returning to the woods\nto roost as the sun declined, and resolved to lose no time in\nendeavouring to win them to his will, and to persuade them to embark\nupon the extraordinary enterprise which he had conceived.\n\n\"Without delay he proceeded to promulgate his plans, flying from tribe\nto tribe, and from flock to flock, ceaselessly proclaiming that the\nkingdom was the wood-pigeons' by right, by reason of their numbers, and\nbecause of the wickedness of Kapchack and his court, which wickedness\nwas notorious, and must end in disaster. As you may imagine, he met with\nlittle or no response--for the most part the pigeons, being of a stolid\nnature, went on with their feeding and talking, and took no notice\nwhatever of his orations. After a while the elder ones, indeed, began to\nsay to each other that this agitator had better be put down and debarred\nfrom freedom of speech, for such seditious language must ultimately be\nreported to Kapchack, who would send his body-guards of hawks among them\nand exact a sanguinary vengeance.\n\n\"Finding himself in danger, Choo Hoo, not one whit abashed, instead of\nfleeing, came before the elders and openly reproached them with\nmisgovernment, cowardice, and the concealment or loss of certain ancient\nprophecies, which foretold the future power of the wood-pigeons, and\nwhich he accused them of holding back out of jealousy, lest they should\nlose the miserable petty authority they enjoyed on account of their age.\nNow, whether there were really any such prophecies, I cannot tell you,\nor whether it was one of Choo Hoo's clever artifices, it is a moot point\namong our most learned antiquaries; the owl, who has the best means of\ninformation, told me once that he believed there was some ground for the\nassertion.\n\n\"At any rate it suited Choo Hoo's purpose very well; for although the\nelders and the heads of the tribes forthwith proceeded to subject him to\nevery species of persecution, and attacked him so violently that he lost\nnearly all his feathers, the common pigeons sympathised with him, and\nhid him from their pursuit. They were the more led to sympathise with\nhim because, on account of their ever-increasing numbers, the territory\nallotted to them by Kapchack was daily becoming less and less suited to\ntheir wants, and, in short, there were some signs of a famine. They,\ntherefore, looked with longing eyes at the fertile country, teeming with\nwheat and acorns around them, and listened with greedy ears to the\ntempting prospect so graphically described by Choo Hoo.\n\n\"Above all, the young pigeons attached themselves to his fortunes and\nfollowed him everywhere in continually increasing bands, for he promised\nthem wives in plenty and trees for their nests without number; for all\nthe trees in their woods were already occupied by the older families,\nwho would not, moreover, part with their daughters to young pigeons who\nhad not a branch to roost on. Some say that the fox, who had long been\ndeeply discontented at the loss of his ancestors' kingdom and of his own\nwealth, which he dissipated so carelessly, did not scruple to advise\nChoo Hoo how to proceed. Be that as it may, I should be the last to\naccuse any one of disloyalty without evident proof; be that as it may,\nthe stir and commotion grew so great among the wood-pigeons, that\npresently the news of it reached King Kapchack.\n\n\"His spies, of whom he has so many (the chief of them is Te-te, the\ntomtit, of whom I bid you beware), brought him full intelligence of what\nwas going on. Kapchack lost no time in calling his principal advisers\naround him; they met close by here (where the council is to take place\nthis afternoon), for he well knew the importance of the news. It was not\nonly, you see, the immense numbers of the wood-pigeons and the\nimpossibility of resisting their march, were they once set in motion,\nbut he had to consider that there was a considerable population of\npigeons in our midst who might turn traitors, and he was by no means\nsure of the allegiance of various other tribes, who were only held down\nby terror.\n\n\"The council fully acknowledged the gravity of the situation, and upon\nthe advice of the hawk it was resolved that Choo Hoo, as the prime mover\nof the trouble, and as the only one capable of bringing matters to a\ncrisis, should be forthwith despatched. But when the executioners\nproceeded to seize him he eluded their clutches with the greatest ease;\nfor his followers (such was their infatuation) devoted their lives to\nhis, and threw themselves in the way of Kapchack's emissaries, the\nhawks, submitting to be torn in pieces rather than see their beloved\nhero lose a feather. Thus baffled, the enraged Kapchack next tried to\nget him assassinated, but, as before, his friends watched about him with\nsuch solicitude that no one could enter the wood where he slept at night\nwithout their raising such a disturbance that their evil purpose was\ndefeated.\n\n\"In his rage Kapchack ordered a decimation of the wood-pigeons, which I\nmyself think was a great mistake; but, as I have told you before, I do\nnot meddle with politics. Still I cannot help thinking that if he had,\ninstead, of his royal bounty and benevolence, given the wood-pigeons an\nincrease of territory, seeing how near they sometimes came to a famine,\nthat they would have been disarmed and their discontent turned to\ngratitude; but he ordered in his rage and terror that they should be\ndecimated, and let loose the whole army of his hawks upon them, so that\nthe slaughter was awful to behold, and the ground was strewn with their\ntorn and mangled bodies. Yet they remained faithful to Choo Hoo, and not\none traitor was found among these loyal barbarians.\n\n\"But Choo Hoo, deeply distressed in mind, said that he would relieve\nthem from the burden of his presence rather than thus be the cause of\ntheir sorrow. He therefore left those provinces and flew out of the\ncountry, leaving word behind him that he would never return till he had\nseen the raven, and recovered from him those ancient prophecies that had\nso long been lost. He flew away, and disappeared in the distance; the\ndays and weeks passed, but he did not return, and at last Kapchack,\nrelieved of his apprehensions, recalled his murderous troops, and the\npigeons were left in peace to lament their Choo Hoo.\n\n\"A twelvemonth passed, and still Choo Hoo did not come; the people said\nhe had been called to the happy Forest of the Heroes, and averred that\nsometimes they heard his voice calling to them when no one was near.\nThere was no doubt that he had gone with the raven. The raven, you must\nknow, my dear Sir Bevis, was once the principal judge and arbiter of\njustice amongst us, so much so that he was above kings, and it is\ncertain that had he been here we should not have had to submit to the\nsanguinary tyranny of Kapchack, nor condemned to witness the scandalous\nbehaviour of his court, or the still greater scandal of his own private\nlife. But for some reason the raven mysteriously left this country about\na hundred years ago, leaving behind him certain prophecies, some of\nwhich no doubt you have heard, especially that upon his return there\nwill be no more famine, nor frost, nor slaughter, nor conflict, but we\nshall all live together in peace.\n\n\"However that may be, the raven has never come back; the learned hold\nthat he must have died long since, for he was so aged when he went away\nno one knew his years, hinting in their disbelief that he went away to\ndie, and so surround his death with a halo of mystery; but the common\npeople are quite of a different opinion, and strenuously uphold the\nbelief that he will some day return. Well, as I told you, a twelvemonth\nwent by, and Choo Hoo did not come, when suddenly in the spring (when\nKapchack himself was much occupied in his palace, and most of his spies\nwere busy with their nests, and the matter had almost been forgotten)\nChoo Hoo reappeared, bringing with him the most beautiful young bride\nthat was ever beheld, as he himself was, on the other hand, the\nstrongest and swiftest of the wood-pigeons.\n\n\"When this was known (and the news spread in a minute) the enthusiasm of\nthe barbarians knew no bounds. Notwithstanding it was nesting-time, they\ncollected in such vast numbers that the boughs cracked with their\nweight; they unanimously proclaimed Choo Hoo emperor (for they disdained\nthe title of king as not sufficiently exalted), and declared their\nintention, as soon as the nesting-time was over, and the proper\nseason--the autumn--for campaigning arrived, of following him, and\ninvading the kingdom of Kapchack.\n\n\"Choo Hoo told them that, after many months of wandering, he had at last\nsucceeded in finding the raven; at least he had not seen the raven\nhimself, but the raven had sent a special messenger, the hawfinch, to\ntell him to be of good cheer, and to return to the wood-pigeons, and to\nlead them forth against Kapchack, who tottered upon his throne; and that\nhe (the raven) would send the night-jar, or goat-sucker, with crooked\nand evil counsels to confound Kapchack's wisdom. And indeed, Bevis, my\ndear, I have myself seen several night-jars about here, and I am rather\ninclined to think that there is some truth in this part at least of what\nChoo Hoo says; for it is an old proverb, which I daresay you have heard,\nthat when the gods design the destruction of a monarch they first make\nhim mad, and what can be more mad than Kapchack's proposed marriage with\nthe jay, to which he was doubtless instigated by the night-jars, who,\nlike genii of the air, have been floating in the dusky summer twilight\nround about his palace?\n\n\"And they have, I really believe, confounded his council and turned his\nwisdom to folly; for Kapchack has been so cunning for so many, many\nyears, and all his family have been so cunning, and all his councillors,\nthat now I do believe (only I do not meddle with politics) that this\nextreme cunning is too clever, and that they will overreach themselves.\nHowever, we shall see what is said at the council by-and-by.\n\n\"Choo Hoo, having told the pigeons this, added that he had further been\ninstructed by the raven to give them a sacred and mystic pass-word and\nrallying cry; he did not himself know what it meant; it was, however,\nsomething very powerful, and by it they would be led to victory. So\nsaying, he called 'Koos-takke!' and at once the vast assembly seized the\nsignal and responded 'Koos-takke!' which mystic syllables are now their\nwar-cry, their call of defiance, and their welcome to their friends. You\nmay often hear them shouting these words in the depths of the woods;\nChoo Hoo learnt them in the enchanted Forest of Savernake, where, as\nevery one knows, there are many mighty magicians, and where, perhaps,\nthe raven is still living in its deep recesses. Now this war-cry\nsupplied, as doubtless the raven had foreseen, the very link that was\nwanting to bind the immense crowd of wood-pigeons together.\nThenceforward they had a common sign and pass-word, and were no longer\nscattered.\n\n\"In the autumn Choo Hoo crossed the border with a vast horde, and\nalthough Kapchack sent his generals, who inflicted enormous losses, such\nas no other nation but the barbarians could have sustained, nothing\ncould stay the advance of such incredible numbers. After a whole autumn\nand winter of severe and continued fighting, Choo Hoo, early in the next\nyear, found that he had advanced some ten (and in places fifteen) miles,\ngiving his people room to feed and move. He had really pushed much\nfarther than that, but he could not hold all the ground he had taken for\nthe following reason. In the spring, as the soft warm weather came, and\nthe sun began to shine, and the rain to fall, and the brook to sing more\nsweetly, and the wind to breathe gently with delicious perfume, and the\ngreen leaves to come forth, the barbarians began to feel the influence\nof love.\n\n\"They could no longer endure to fly in the dense column, they no longer\nobeyed the voice of their captain. They fell in love, and each marrying\nset about to build a nest, free and unmolested in those trees that Choo\nHoo had promised them. Choo Hoo himself retired with his lovely bride to\nthe ancestral ash, and passed the summer in happy dalliance. With the\nautumn the campaign recommenced, and with exactly the same result. After\na second autumn and winter of fighting, Choo Hoo had pushed his frontier\nanother fifteen miles farther into Kapchack's kingdom. Another summer of\nlove followed, and so it went on year after year, Choo Hoo's forces\nmeantime continually increasing in numbers, since there were now no\nrestrictions as to nest trees, but one and all could marry.\n\n\"Till at last he has under his sway a horde of trained warriors, whose\nnumbers defy calculation, and he has year by year pushed into Kapchack's\nterritory till now it seems as if he must utterly overwhelm and destroy\nthat monarch. This he would doubtless have achieved ere now, but there\nis one difficulty which has considerably impeded his advance, as he came\nfarther and farther from his native province. This difficulty is water.\n\n\"For in the winter, when the Long Pond is frozen, and the brook nearly\ncovered with ice, and all the ponds and ditches likewise, so vast a\nhorde cannot find enough to satisfy their thirst, and must consequently\ndisperse. Were it not for this Choo Hoo must ere now have overwhelmed\nus. As it is, Kapchack shivers in his claws, and we all dread the\napproaching autumn, for Choo Hoo has now approached so near as to be at\nour very doors. If he only knew one thing he would have no difficulty\nin remaining here and utterly destroying us.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Will you promise faithfully not to tell any one?\" said the squirrel,\n\"for my own existence depends upon this horde of barbarians being kept\nat bay; for, you see, should they pass over they will devour everything\nin the land, and there will certainly be a famine--the most dreadful\nthat has ever been seen.\"\n\n\"I will promise,\" said Bevis. \"I promise you faithfully.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you,\" went on the squirrel. \"In this copse of mine\nthere is a spring of the clearest and sweetest water (you shall see it,\nI will take you to it some day) which is a great secret, for it is so\nhidden by ferns and fir-trees overhanging it, that no one knows anything\nabout it, except Kapchack, myself, the weasel, and the fox; I wish the\nweasel did not know, for he is so gluttonous for blood, which makes him\nthirsty, that he is continually dipping his murderous snout into the\ndelicious water.\n\n\"Now this spring, being so warm in the fern, and coming out of ground\nwhich is, in a manner, warm too, of all the springs in this province\ndoes not freeze, but always runs clear all the winter. If Choo Hoo only\nknew it, don't you see, he could stay in Kapchack's country, no matter\nhow hard the frost, and his enormous army, whose main object is plunder,\nwould soon starve us altogether. But he does not know of it.\n\n\"He has sent several of his spies, the wood-cocks, to search the\ncountry for such a spring, but although they are the most cunning of\nbirds at that trick, they have not yet succeeded in finding my spring\nand thrusting their long bills into it. They dare not come openly, but\nfly by night, for Kapchack's hawks are always hovering about; well\nenough he knows the importance of this secret, and they would pay for\ntheir temerity with their lives if they were seen. All I am afraid of is\nlest the weasel or the fox, in their eagerness for empire, should betray\nthe secret to Choo Hoo.\n\n\"The fox, though full of duplicity, and not to be depended upon, is at\nleast brave and bold, and so far as I can judge his character would not,\nfor his own sake (hoping some day to regain the kingdom), let out this\nsecret. But of the weasel I am not so sure; he is so very wicked, and so\ncunning, no one can tell what he may do. Thus it is that in the highest\nof my beech trees I do not feel secure, but am in continual fear lest a\nwood-cock should steal in, or the weasel play the traitor, for if so a\nfamine is imminent, and that is why I support, so far as I can without\nmeddling with politics, the throne of Kapchack, as the last barrier\nagainst this terrible fate.\n\n\"Even now could he but be brought to reform his present life something\nmight be hoped for, for he has a powerful army; but, as you have seen,\nthis affair with the jay has caused ambitious ideas to spring up in the\nminds of his chief courtiers, some of whom (especially, I think, the\ncrow and the weasel) are capable of destroying a country for their\nprivate and personal advantage. Therefore it is that I look forward to\nthis council, now about to be held, with intense anxiety, for upon it\nwill depend our future, the throne of Kapchack, our existence or\ndestruction. And here comes the rook; the first as usual.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE COUNCIL.\n\n\nBefore Bevis could ask any questions, the squirrel went off to speak to\nthe rook, and to show him a good bough to perch on near the owl's\ncastle. He then came back and conducted Bevis to the seat in the\nash-stole, where he was hidden by the honeysuckle, but could see well\nabout him. Hardly had Bevis comfortably seated himself than the\ncouncillors began to arrive. They were all there; even the rat did not\ndare stay away, lest his loyalty should be suspected, but took up his\nstation at the foot of the pollard-tree, and the mouse sat beside him.\nThe rook sat on the oak, no great way from the squirrel; Kauc, the crow,\nchose a branch of ash which projected close to the pollard. So envious\nwas he of the crown that he could not stay far from it.\n\nCloctaw, the jackdaw, who had flown to the council with him, upon\narrival, left his side, and perched rather in the rear. Reynard, the\nfox, and Sec, the stoat, his friend, waited the approach of the king by\nsome fern near the foot of the pollard. The owl every now and then\nappeared at the window of his castle, sometimes to see who had arrived,\nand sometimes to look for the king, who was not yet in sight. Having\nglanced round, the owl retreated to his study, doubtless to prepare his\nspeech for this important occasion. The heaving up of the leaves and\nearth, as if an underground plough was at work, showed that the mole had\nnot forgotten his duty; he had come to show his loyalty, and he brought\na message from the badger, who had long since been left outside the\nconcert of the animals and birds, humbly begging King Kapchack to accept\nhis homage.\n\nIt is true that neither the hare nor the rabbit were present, but that\nsignified nothing, for they had no influence whatever. But the pheasant,\nwho often stood aloof from the court, in his pride of lineage despising\nKapchack though he was king, came on this occasion, for he too, like the\nsquirrel, was alarmed at the progress of Choo Hoo, and dreaded a\nscarcity of the berries of the earth. Tchink, the chaffinch, one of the\nfirst to come, could not perch still, but restlessly passed round the\ncircle, now talking to one and now to another, and sometimes peering in\nat the owl's window. But merry as he was, he turned his back upon Te-te,\nthe tomtit, and chief of the spies, disdaining the acquaintance of a\ncommon informer. Te-te, not one whit abashed, sat on a willow, and\nlifted his voice from time to time.\n\nThe jay came presently, and for some reason or other he was in high good\nspirits, and dressed in his gayest feathers. He chaffed the owl, and\njoked with Tchink; then he laughed to himself, and tried to upset the\ngrave old Cloctaw from his seat, and, in short, played all sorts of\npranks to the astonishment of everybody, who had hitherto seen him in\nsuch distress for the loss of his lady-love. Everybody thought he had\nlost his senses. Eric, the favourite missel-thrush (not the\nconspirator), took his station very high up on the ash above Kauc, whom\nhe hated and suspected of treason, not hesitating even to say so aloud.\nKauc, indeed, was not now quite comfortable in his position, but kept\nslyly glancing up at the missel-thrush, and would have gone elsewhere\nhad it not been that everybody was looking.\n\nThe wood-pigeon came to the hawthorn, some little way from the castle;\nhe represented, and was the chief of those pigeons who dwelt peacefully\nin Kapchack's kingdom, although aliens by race. His position was\ndifficult in the extreme, for upon the one hand he knew full well that\nKapchack was suspicious of him lest he should go over to Choo Hoo, and\nmight at any moment order his destruction, and upon the other hand he\nhad several messages from Choo Hoo calling upon him to join his\nbrethren, the invaders, on pain of severe punishment. Uncertain as to\nhis fate, the wood-pigeon perched on the hawthorn at the skirt of the\ncouncil place, hoping from thence to get some start if obliged to flee\nfor his life. The dove, his friend, constant in misfortune, sat near him\nto keep him in countenance.\n\nThe humble-bee, the bee, the butterfly, the cricket, the grasshopper,\nthe beetle, and many others arrived as the hour drew on. Last of all\ncame Ki Ki, lord of all the hawks, attended with his retinue, and\nheralding the approach of the king. Ki Ki perched on a tree at the side\nof the pollard, and his warriors ranged themselves around him: a\nterrible show, at which the mouse verily shrank into the ground.\nImmediately afterwards a noise of wings and talking announced the\narrival of Kapchack, who came in full state, with eight of his finest\nguards. The king perched on the top of the pollard, just over the owl's\nwindow, and the eight magpies sat above and around, but always behind\nhim.\n\n\"What an ugly old fellow he is!\" whispered Bevis, who had never before\nseen him. \"Look at his ragged tail!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said the squirrel, \"Te-te is too near.\"\n\n\"Are they all here?\" asked the king, after he had looked round and\nreceived the bows and lowly obeisance of his subjects.\n\n\"They are all here,\" said the owl, sitting in his porch. \"They are all\nhere--at least, I think; no, they are not, your majesty.\"\n\n\"Who is absent?\" said Kapchack, frowning, and all the assembly cowered.\n\n\"It is the weasel,\" said the owl. \"The weasel is not here.\"\n\nKapchack frowned and looked as black as thunder, and a dead silence fell\nupon the council.\n\n\"If it please your majesty,\" said the humble-bee, presently coming to\nthe front. \"If it please your majesty, the weasel----\"\n\n\"It does _not_ please me,\" said Kapchack.\n\nBut the humble-bee began again: \"If it please your majesty----\"\n\n\"His majesty is _not_ pleased,\" repeated the owl, severely.\n\nBut the humble-bee, who could sing but one tune, began again: \"If it\nplease your majesty, the weasel asked me to say----\"\n\n\"What?\" said the king, in a terrible rage. \"What did he say?\"\n\n\"If it please your majesty,\" said the humble-bee, who must begin over\nagain every time he was interrupted, \"the weasel asked me to say that he\nsent his humble, his most humble, loyal, and devoted obedience, and\nbegged that you would forgive his absence from the council, as he has\njust met with a severe accident in the hunting-field, and cannot put one\npaw before the other.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it,\" said King Kapchack. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"If it please your majesty,\" said the humble-bee, \"he is lying on a bank\nbeyond the copse, stretched out in the sunshine, licking his paw, and\nhoping that rest and sunshine will cure him.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a story!\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Hush,\" said the squirrel.\n\n\"Somebody said it was a story,\" said the owl.\n\n\"So it is,\" said Te-te. \"I have made it my business to search out the\ngoings-on of the weasel, who has kept himself in the background of late,\nsuspecting that he was up to no good, and with the aid of my lieutenant,\nthe tree-climber, I have succeeded in discovering his retreat, which he\nhas concealed even from your majesty.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" said Kapchack.\n\n\"It is in the elm, just there,\" said Te-te, \"just by those raspberries.\"\n\n\"The rascal,\" said the owl, in a great fright. \"Then he has been close\nby all the time listening.\"\n\n\"Yes, he has been listening,\" said Te-te, meaningly.\n\nThe owl became pale, remembering the secret meeting of the birds, and\nwhat was said there, all of which the treacherous weasel must have\noverheard. He passed it off by exclaiming: \"This is really intolerable\".\n\n\"It _is_ intolerable,\" said Kapchack; \"and you,\" addressing the\nhumble-bee, \"wretch that you are to bring me a false message----\"\n\n\"If it please your majesty,\" began the humble-bee, but he was seized\nupon by the bee (who was always jealous of him), and the butterfly, and\nthe beetle, and hustled away from the precinct of the council.\n\n\"Bring the weasel here, this instant,\" shouted Kapchack. \"Drag him here\nby the ears.\"\n\nEverybody stood up, but everybody hesitated, for though they all hated\nthe weasel they all feared him. Ki Ki, the hawk, bold as he was, could\nnot do much in the bushes, nor enter a hole; Kauc, the crow, was in the\nlike fix, and he intended if he was called upon to take refuge in the\npretence of his age; the stoat, fierce as he was, shrank from facing the\nweasel, being afraid of his relation's tricks and stratagems. Even the\nfox, though he was the biggest of all, hesitated, for he recollected\nonce when Pan, the spaniel, snapped at the weasel, the weasel made his\nteeth meet in Pan's nostrils.\n\nThus they all hesitated, when the rat suddenly stood out and said: \"I\nwill fetch the weasel, your majesty; I will bring that hateful traitor\nto your feet\".\n\n\"Do so, good and loyal rat,\" said the king, well pleased. And the rat\nran off to compel the weasel to come.\n\nAs the elm was so close, they all looked that way, expecting to hear\nsounds of fighting; but in less than half-a-minute the rat appeared,\nwith the weasel limping on three legs in his rear. For when the weasel\nheard what the rat said, he knew it was of no use to stay away any\nlonger; but in his heart he vowed that he would, sooner or later, make\nthe rat smart for his officious interference.\n\nWhen he came near, the weasel fell down and bowed himself before the\nking, who said nothing, but eyed him scornfully.\n\n\"I am guilty,\" said the weasel, in a very humble voice; \"I am guilty of\ndisobedience to your majesty's commands, and I am guilty of sending you\na deceitful message, for which my poor friend the humble-bee has been\ncruelly hustled from your presence; but I am not guilty of the treason\nof which I am accused. I hid in the elm, your majesty, because I went in\nterror of my life, and I feigned to be ill, in order to stay away from\nthe council, because there is not one of all these (he pointed to the\ncircle of councillors) who has not sworn to destroy me, and I feared to\nventure forth. They have all banded together to compass my destruction,\nbecause I alone of all of them have remained faithful to your throne,\nand have not secretly conspired.\"\n\nAt these words, there was such an outcry on the part of all the birds\nand animals, that the wood echoed with their cries; for the stoat\nsnapped his teeth, and the fox snarled, and the jay screamed, and the\nhawk napped his wings, and the crow said \"Caw!\" and the rook \"Haw!\" and\nall so eagerly denied the imputation, that it was some minutes before\neven King Kapchack could make himself heard.\n\nWhen the noise in some degree subsided, however, he said: \"Weasel, you\nare so false of tongue, and you have so many shifts and contrivances\n('That he has!' said Bevis, who was delighted at the downfall of the\nweasel), that it is no longer possible for any of us to believe anything\nyou say. We have now such important business before us, that we cannot\nstop to proceed to your trial and execution, and we therefore order that\nin the meantime you remain where you are, and that you maintain complete\nsilence--for you are degraded from your rank--until such time as we can\nattend to your contemptible body, which will shortly dangle from a tree,\nas a warning to traitors for all time to come. My lords, we will now\nproceed with our business, and, first of all, the secretary will read\nthe roll-call of our forces.\"\n\nThe owl then read the list of the army, and said: \"First, your majesty's\ndevoted body-guard, with--with Prince Tchack-tchack (the king frowned,\nand the jay laughed outright) at their head; Ki Ki, lord of hawks, one\nthousand beaks; the rooks, five thousand beaks; Kauc, the crow, two\nhundred beaks;\" and so on, enumerating the numbers which all the tribes\ncould bring to battle.\n\nIn the buzz of conversation that arose while the owl was reading (as it\nusually does), the squirrel told Bevis that he believed the crow had not\nreturned the number of his warriors correctly, but that there were\nreally many more, whom he purposely kept in the background. As for\nPrince Tchack-tchack, his absence from the council evidently disturbed\nhis majesty, though he was too proud to show how he felt the defection\nof his eldest son and heir.\n\nThe number of the rooks, too, was not accurate, and did not give a true\nidea of their power, for it was the original estimate furnished many\nyears ago, when Kapchack first organised his army, and although the\nrooks had greatly increased since then, the same return was always made.\nBut it was well understood that the nation of the rooks could send, and\ndoubtless would send, quite ten thousand beaks into the field.\n\n\"It is not a little curious,\" said the squirrel, \"that the rooks, who,\nas you know, belong to a limited monarchy--so limited that they have no\nreal king--should form the main support of so despotic a monarch as\nKapchack, who obtains even more decisive assistance from them than from\nthe ferocious and wily Ki Ki. It is an illustration of the singular\ncomplexity and paradoxical positions of politics that those who are\nnaturally so opposed, should thus form the closest friends and allies.\nI do not understand why it is so myself, for as you know, dear, I do not\nattempt to meddle with politics, but the owl has several times very\nlearnedly discoursed to me upon this subject, and I gather from him that\none principal reason why the rooks support the tyrant Kapchack, is\nbecause they well know if he is not king some one else will be. Now\nKapchack, in return for their valuable services, has, for one thing,\nordered Ki Ki on no account to interfere with them (which is the reason\nthey have become so populous), and under the nominal rule of Kapchack\nthey really enjoy greater liberty than they otherwise could.\n\n\"But the beginning of the alliance, it seems, was in this way. Many\nyears ago, when Kapchack was a young monarch, and by no means firmly\nestablished upon his throne, he sought about for some means of gaining\nthe assistance of the rooks. He observed that in the spring, when the\nrooks repaired their dwellings, they did so in a very inferior manner,\ndoing indeed just as their forefathers had done before them, and\nrepeating the traditional architecture handed down through innumerable\ngenerations. So ill-constructed were their buildings, that if, as often\nchanced, the March winds blew with fury, it was a common thing to see\nthe grass strewn with the wreck of their houses. Now Kapchack and all\nhis race are excellent architects, and it occurred to him to do the\nrooks a service, by instructing them how to bind their lower courses, so\nthat they should withstand the wind.\n\n\"With some difficulty, for the older rooks, though they would loudly\ndeny it, are eminently conservative (a thing I do not profess to\nunderstand), he succeeded in persuading the younger builders to adopt\nhis design; and the result was that in the end they all took to it, and\nnow it is quite the exception to hear of an accident. Besides the\npreservation of life, Kapchack's invention also saved them an immense\namount in timber for rebuilding. The consequence has been that the\nrooks have flourished above all other birds. They at once concluded an\nalliance with Kapchack, and as they increased in numbers, so they became\nmore firmly attached to his throne.\n\n\"It is not that they feel any gratitude--far from it, they are a selfish\nrace--but they are very keen after their own interest, which is,\nperhaps, the strongest tie. For, as I observed, the rooks live under a\nlimited monarchy; they had real kings of their own centuries since, but\nnow their own king is only a name, a state fiction. Every single rook\nhas a voice in the affairs of the nation (hence the tremendous clamour\nyou may hear in their woods towards sunset when their assemblies are\nheld), but the practical direction of their policy is entrusted to a\ncircle or council of about ten of the older rooks, distinguished for\ntheir oratorical powers. These depute, again, one of their own number to\nKapchack's court; you see him yonder, his name is Kauhaha. The council\nconsiders, I have no doubt, that by supporting Kapchack they retain\ntheir supremacy, for very likely if they did not have a foreigner to\nreign over them, some clever genius of their own race would arise and\noverturn these mighty talkers.\n\n\"On the other hand Kapchack fully appreciates their services, and if he\ndared he would give the chief command of his forces to the generalissimo\nof the rooks--not the one who sits yonder--the commander's name is Ah\nKurroo. But he dreads the jealousy of Ki Ki, who is extremely off-handed\nand high in his ways, and might go off with his contingent. I am curious\nto see who will have the command. As for the starlings, I daresay you\nwill notice their absence; they are under the jurisdiction of the rooks,\nand loyal as their masters; the reason they are not here is because they\nare already mobilised and have taken the field; they were despatched in\nall haste very early this morning, before you were awake, Bevis dear, to\noccupy the slope from whence the peewits fled. Now they are discussing\nthe doubtful allies.\"\n\n\"The larks,\" the owl was saying as the squirrel finished, \"have sent a\nmessage which I consider extremely impertinent. They have dared to say\nthat they have nothing whatever to do with the approaching contest, and\ndecline to join either party. They say that from time immemorial they\nhave been free mountaineers, owing allegiance to no one, and if they\nhave attended your court it has been from courtesy, and not from any\nnecessity that they were under.\"\n\n\"They are despicable creatures,\" said the king, who was secretly\nannoyed, but would not show it. \"Ki Ki, I deliver them over to you; let\nyour men plunder them as they like.\"\n\n\"The finches,\" went on the owl. \"I hardly know----\"\n\n\"We are loyal to the last feather,\" said Tchink, the chaffinch, bold as\nbrass, and coming to the front, to save his friends from the fate of the\nlarks. \"Your majesty, we are perfectly loyal--why, our troops, whom you\nknow are only lightly armed, have already gone forward, and have\noccupied the furze on the summits of the hills.\"\n\n\"I am much pleased,\" said the king, who had been a little doubtful.\n\"Tell your friends to continue in that spirit.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Tchink, laughing in Ki Ki's face; he actually\nflew close by the terrible hawk, and made a face at him, for he knew\nthat he was disappointed, having hoped for permission to tear and rend\nthe finches as the larks.\n\n\"The thrushes,\" began the owl again.\n\n\"Pooh,\" said the king, \"they are feeble things; we can easily keep the\nwhole nation of them in subjection by knocking out some of their brains\nnow and then, can't we, Ki Ki?\"\n\n\"It is a capital way,\" said Ki Ki. \"There is no better.\"\n\n\"They are fit for nothing but ambassadors and couriers,\" said Kapchack.\n\"We will not waste any more time over such folk whose opinions are\nnothing to us. Now I call upon you all to express your views as to the\nbest means of conducting the campaign, and what measures had better be\ntaken for the defence of our dominions. Ki Ki, speak first.\"\n\n\"I am for immediate action,\" said Ki Ki. \"Let us advance and attack at\nonce, for every day swells the ranks of Choo Hoo's army, and should\nthere be early frosts it would be so largely increased that the mere\nnumbers must push us back. Besides which in a short time he will receive\nlarge reinforcements, for his allies, the fieldfares and redwings, are\npreparing to set sail across the sea hither. But now, before his host\nbecomes irresistible, is our opportunity; I counsel instant attack. War\nto the beak is my motto!\"\n\n\"War to the beak,\" said the crow.\n\n\"War to the beak,\" said the jay, carefully adjusting his brightest\nfeathers, \"and our ladies will view our deeds.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said the rook, \"with what Ki Ki says.\" The rook was not so\nnoisy and impetuous as the hawk, but he was even more warlike, and by\nfar the better statesman. \"I think,\" Kauhaha went on, \"that we should\nnot delay one hour, but advance and occupy the plain where Choo Hoo is\nalready diminishing our supplies of food. If our supplies are consumed\nor cut off our condition will become critical.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said everybody except the crow, who hated the rook. \"Hear!\nhear! the rook speaks well.\"\n\n\"All are then for immediately advancing?\" said Kapchack, much pleased.\n\n\"May it please your majesty,\" said the fox, thus humbling himself, he\nwho was the descendant of kings, \"may it please your majesty, I am not\ncertain that the proposed course is the wisest. For, if I may be\npermitted to say so, it appears to me that the facts are exactly\nopposite to what Ki Ki and the rook have put forward as the reason for\nbattle. My experience convinces me that the very vastness of Choo Hoo's\nhost is really its weakness. The larger his numbers the less he can\neffect. It is clear that they must soon, if they continue to draw\ntogether in these enormous bodies, destroy all the forage of the\ncountry, and unless they are prepared to die of starvation they must\nperforce retire.\n\n\"If, therefore, your majesty could be prevailed upon to listen to my\ncounsels, I would the rather suggest, most humbly suggest, that the\ndefensive is your best course. Here in the copse you have an enclosure\ncapable with a little trouble of being converted into an impregnable\nfortress. Already the ditches are deep, the curtain wall of hawthorn\nhigh and impenetrable, the approaches narrow. By retiring hither with\nyour forces, occupying every twig, and opposing a beak in every\ndirection, you would be absolutely safe, and it is easy to foresee what\nwould happen.\n\n\"Choo Hoo, boastful and vainglorious, would approach with his enormous\nhorde; he would taunt us, no doubt, with his absurd 'Koos-takke,' which\nI verily believe has no meaning at all, and of which we need take no\nheed. In a few days, having exhausted the supplies, he would have to\nretire, and then sallying forth we could fall upon his rear and utterly\ndestroy his unwieldy army.\"\n\nThis advice made some impression upon Kapchack, notwithstanding that he\nwas much prejudiced against the fox, for it was evidently founded upon\nfacts, and the fox was known to have had great experience. Kapchack\nappeared thoughtful, and leaning his head upon one side was silent, when\nKauc, the crow (who had his own reasons for wishing Kapchack to run as\nmuch risk as possible), cried out that the fox was a coward, and wanted\nto sneak into a hole. Ki Ki shouted applaudingly; the rook said he for\none could not shut himself up while the country was ravaged; and the jay\nsaid the ladies would despise them. Kapchack remembered that the fox had\nalways had a character for duplicity, and perhaps had some secret motive\nfor his advice, and just then, in the midst of the uproar, a starling\nflew into the circle with part of his tail gone and his feathers greatly\nruffled.\n\nIt was evident that he had brought news from the seat of war, and they\nall crowded about him. So soon as he had recovered breath the starling\ntold them that half-an-hour since Choo Hoo had himself crossed the\nborder, and driving in the outposts of the starlings, despite the most\ndesperate resistance, had passed the front line of the hills. At this\nnews the uproar was tremendous, and for some time not a word could be\nheard. By-and-by the owl obtained something like order, when the rook\nsaid he for one could not stay in council any longer, he must proceed to\nassemble the forces of his nation, as while they were talking his city\nmight be seized. Ki Ki, too, flapping his wings, announced his intention\nof attacking; the jay uttered a sneer about one-eyed people not being\nable to see what was straight before them, and thus goaded on against\nhis better judgment, Kapchack declared his intention of sending his army\nto the front.\n\nHe then proceeded to distribute the commands. Ki Ki was proclaimed\ncommander-in-chief (the rook did not like this, but he said nothing, as\nhe knew Kapchack could not help himself), and the rooks had the right\nwing, the crow the left wing (the crow was surprised at this, for his\nusual post was to guard the rear, but he guessed at once that Kapchack\nsuspected him, and would not leave him near the palace), and the owl had\nthe reserve. As they received their orders, each flew off; even the owl,\nthough it was daylight, started forth to summon his men, and though he\nblundered against the branches, did not stay a second on that account.\nThe squirrel had charge of the stores, and jumped down to see after\nthem. Not one was forgotten, but each had an office assigned, and went\nto execute it, all except the fox and the weasel. The weasel, obedient\nto orders, lay still at the foot of the pollard, humbly hiding his head.\n\nThe fox, presently finding that he had been overlooked, crept under\nKapchack, and, bowing to the earth, asked if there was no command and no\nemployment for him.\n\n\"Begone,\" said Kapchack, who was not going to entrust power to one of\nroyal descent. \"Begone, sir; you have not shown any ability lately.\"\n\n\"But did not the gnat tell you?\" began the fox, humbly.\n\n\"The gnat told me a great deal,\" said Kapchack.\n\n\"But did he not say I sent him?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Kapchack, for the gnat, not to be outdone, had indeed\ndelivered the fox's message, but had taken the credit of it for himself.\n\"Begone, sir (the fox slunk away); and do you (to his guards) go to the\nfirs and wait for me there.\" The eight magpies immediately departed, and\nthere was no one left but the weasel.\n\nThe king looked down at the guilty traitor; the traitor hung his head.\nPresently the king said: \"Weasel, false and double-tongued weasel, did I\nnot choose you to be my chiefest and most secret counsellor? Did you not\nknow everything? Did I not consult you on every occasion, and were you\nnot promoted to high honour and dignity? And you have repaid me by\nplotting against my throne, and against my life; the gnat has told me\neverything, and it is of no avail for you to deny it. You double\ntraitor, false to me and false to those other traitors who met in this\nvery place to conspire against me. It is true you were not among them in\nperson, but why were you not among them? Do you suppose that I am to be\ndeceived for a moment? Wretch that you are. You set them on to plot\nagainst me while you kept out of it with clean paws, that you might\nseize the throne so soon as I was slain. Wretch that you are.\"\n\nHere the weasel could not endure it any longer, but crawling to the foot\nof the tree, besought the king with tears in his eyes to do what he\nwould--to order him to instant execution, but not to reproach him with\nthese enormities, which cut him to the very soul. But the more he\npleaded, the more angry Kapchack became, and heaped such epithets upon\nthe crouching wretch, and so bitterly upbraided him that at last the\nweasel could bear it no more, but driven as it were into a corner,\nturned to bay, and faced the enraged monarch.\n\nHe sat up, and looking Kapchack straight in the face, as none but so\nhardened a reprobate could have done, he said, in a low but very\ndistinct voice: \"You have no right to say these things to me, any more\nthan you have to wear the crown! I do not believe you are Kapchack at\nall--you are an impostor!\"\n\nAt these words Kapchack became as pale as death, and could not keep his\nperch upon the pollard, but fluttered down to the ground beside the\nweasel. He was so overcome that for a moment or two he could not speak.\nWhen he found breath, he turned to the weasel and asked him what he\nmeant. The weasel, who had now regained his spirits, said boldly enough\nthat he meant what he said; he did not believe that the king was really\nKapchack.\n\n\"But I am Kapchack,\" said the king, trembling, and not knowing how much\nthe weasel knew.\n\nIn truth the weasel knew very little, but had only shot a bolt at random\nfrom the bow of his suspicions, but he had still a sharper shaft to\nshoot, and he said: \"You are an impostor, for you told La Schach, who\nhas jilted you, that you were not so old as you looked.\"\n\n\"The false creature!\" said Kapchack, quite beside himself with rage. In\nhis jealousy of Prince Tchack-tchack, who was so much younger, and had\ntwo eyes, he had said this, and now he bitterly repented his vanity.\n\"The false creature!\" he screamed, \"where is she? I will have her torn\nto pieces! She shall be pecked limb from limb! Where is she?\" he\nshrieked. \"She left the palace yesterday evening, and I have not seen\nher since.\"\n\n\"She went to the firs with the jay,\" said the weasel. \"He is her old\nlover, you know. Did you not see how merry he was just now, at the\ncouncil?\"\n\nThen Kapchack pecked up the ground with his beak, and tore at it with\nhis claws, and gave way to his impotent anger.\n\n\"There shall not be a feather of her left!\" he said. \"I will have her\nutterly destroyed! She shall be nailed to a tree!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" said the weasel, with a sneer. \"She is too\nbeautiful. As soon as you see her, you will kiss her and forgive her.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Kapchack, becoming calmer. \"She is so beautiful, she\nmust be forgiven. Weasel, in consideration of important services\nrendered to the state in former days, upon this one occasion you shall\nbe pardoned. Of course the condition is that what has passed between us\nthis day is kept strictly private, and that you do not breathe a word of\nit.\"\n\n\"Not a word of it,\" said the weasel.\n\n\"And you must disabuse your mind of that extraordinary illusion as to my\nidentity of which you spoke just now. You must dismiss so absurd an idea\nfrom your mind.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the weasel, \"it is dismissed entirely. But, your\nmajesty, with your permission, I would go further. I would endeavour to\nexplain to you, that although my conduct was indiscreet, and so far open\nto misconstruction, there was really nothing more in it than an\nill-directed zeal in your service. It is really true, your majesty, that\nall the birds and animals are leagued against me, and that is why I have\nbeen afraid to stir abroad. I was invited to the secret council, of\nwhich you have heard from the gnat, and because I did not attend it,\nthey have one and all agreed to vilify me to your majesty.\n\n\"But in fact I, for once, with the service of your majesty in view,\ndescended (repugnant as it was to my feelings) to play the eavesdropper,\nand I overheard all that was said, and I can convince your majesty that\nthere are far greater traitors in your dominions than you ever supposed\nme to be. The gnat does not know half that took place at the council,\nfor he only had it second-hand from that villain, the fox, who is, I\nbelieve, secretly bent on your destruction. But I can tell you not only\nall that went on--I can also relate to you the designs of Kauc, the\ncrow, who conferred with Cloctaw in private, after the meeting was over.\nAnd I can also give you good reasons for suspecting Ki Ki, the hawk,\nwhom you have just nominated to the command of your forces, of the\nintention of making a bargain with Choo Hoo, and of handing you over to\nhim a prisoner.\"\n\nNow this last was a pure invention of the weasel's out of envy, since Ki\nKi had obtained such distinction. Kapchack, much alarmed at these words,\nordered him to relate everything in order, and the weasel told him all\nthat had been said at the council, all that Kauc, the crow, had said to\nCloctaw, and a hundred other matters which he made up himself. When\nKapchack heard these things he was quite confounded, and exclaimed that\nhe was surrounded with traitors, and that he did not see which way to\nturn. He hopped a little way off, in order the better to consider by\nhimself, and leant his head upon one side.\n\nFirst he thought to himself: \"I must take the command from Ki Ki, but I\ncannot do that suddenly, lest he should go over to Choo Hoo. I will\ntherefore do it gradually. I will countermand the order for an immediate\nattack; that will give me time to arrange. Who is to take Ki Ki's place?\nClearly the weasel, for though he is an archtraitor, yet he is in the\nsame boat with me; for I know it to be perfectly true that all of them\nare bitter against him.\"\n\nSo he went back to the weasel, and told him that he should give him the\nchief command of the forces, on the third day following, and meantime\ntold him to come early in the evening to the drain which passed under\nthe orchard, where his palace was, so that he could concert the details\nof this great state business in secret with him.\n\nThe weasel, beyond measure delighted at the turn things had taken, and\nrejoicing extremely at the impending fall of Ki Ki, whom he hated,\nthanked Kapchack with all his might, till Kapchack, enjoining on him the\nnecessity of secrecy, said \"Good-afternoon\"; and flew away towards the\nfirs, where his guard was waiting for him. Then the weasel, puffed up\nand treading the ground proudly, went back to his cave in the elm, and\nBevis, seeing that there was nothing more going on that day, stole back\nto the raspberry canes.\n\nNone of them had noticed, not even the cunning weasel, that the mole,\nwhen the council broke up, had not left with the rest: indeed, being\nunder the surface of the earth, they easily overlooked him. Now the\nmole, who hated the weasel beyond all, had waited to have the pleasure\nof hearing King Kapchack upbraid the traitor, and presently consign him\nto execution. Fancy then his feelings when, after all, the weasel was\nreceived into the highest favour, and promised the supreme command of\nthe army, while he himself was not even noticed, though he was a clever\nengineer, and could mine and countermine, and carry on siege operations\nbetter than any of them.\n\nHe listened to all that was said attentively, and then, so soon as\nKapchack had flown away, and the weasel had gone to his hole, and Bevis\nto the raspberries, he drove a tunnel to the edge of the copse, and\nthere calling a fly, sent him with a message to the hawk, asking Ki Ki\nto meet him beside the leaning stone in the field (which Bevis had once\npassed), because he had a secret to communicate which would brook no\ndelay. At the same time, as Kapchack was flying to the firs where his\nguards were waiting, it occurred to him that, although he had no\nalternative, it was dangerous in the extreme to trust the army to the\nweasel, who, perhaps, just as there was an opportunity of victory, would\nretire, and leave him to be destroyed. Thinking about this, he perched\non a low hawthorn bush, and asked himself whether it was worth while to\nattempt to defend a kingdom held under such precarious tenure. Would it\nnot be better to make terms with Choo Hoo, who was not unreasonable, and\nto divide the territory, and thus reign in peace and safety over half at\nleast,--making it, of course, a condition of the compact that Choo Hoo\nshould help him to put down all domestic traitors?\n\nThe idea seemed so good that, first glancing round to see that he was\nnot observed, he called a thrush, who had been coming to the hawthorn,\nbut dared not enter it while the king was there. The thrush, much\nfrightened, came as he was bid, and Kapchack carefully instructed him in\nwhat he was to do. Having learnt his message by heart, the thrush,\ndelighted beyond expression at so high a negotiation being entrusted to\nhim, flew straight away towards Choo Hoo's camp. But not unobserved; for\njust then Ki Ki, wheeling in the air at an immense height, whither he\nhad gone to survey the scene of war, chanced to look down and saw him\nquit the king, and marked the course he took. Kapchack, unaware that Ki\nKi had detected this manoeuvre, now returned to his guards, and flew\nto his palace.\n\nMeantime the weasel, curled up on his divan in the elm, was thinking\nover the extraordinary good fortune that had befallen him. Yet such was\nhis sagacity that even when thus about to attain almost the topmost\npinnacle of his ambition, he did not forget the instability of affairs,\nbut sought to confirm his position, or even to advance it. He reflected\nthat Kapchack was not only cunning beyond everything ever known, but he\nwas just now a prey to anxieties, and consumed with jealousy, which\nupset the tenor of his mind, so that his course could not be depended\nupon, but might be changed in a moment. The favour of a despotic monarch\nwas never a firm staff to lean upon; when that monarch was on the brink\nof a crisis which threatened both his throne and his life, his smile\nmight become a frown before any one was aware that a change was\nimpending.\n\nImpressed with these ideas, the weasel asked himself how he could at\nonce secure his position and advance himself to further dignity. He\nconsidered that up to the present the forces of Kapchack had always been\ncompelled to retreat before the overwhelming masses thrown against them\nby Choo Hoo. He could scarcely hope under the most favourable\ncircumstances to do more than defend the frontier, and should Choo Hoo\nwin the battle, Kapchack would either be taken prisoner, or, what was\nnot at all unlikely, fall a victim during the confusion, and be\nassassinated, perhaps, by the villainous crow. Where, then, would be his\nown high command? But by making terms with Choo Hoo he might himself\nobtain the throne, and reign perfectly secure as Choo Hoo's regent.\n\nOn coming to this conclusion, he called to his old friend the\nhumble-bee, and said he desired to send a message to Choo Hoo, the\npurport of which must not be divulged to any flower upon the route. The\nhumble-bee instantly guessed that this message must be something to the\ninjury of Kapchack, and resenting the manner in which he had been\nhustled from the council, declared that he would carry it without a\nmoment's delay.\n\n\"Go then, my friend,\" said the weasel. \"Go straight to Choo Hoo, and\nsay: 'The weasel is appointed to the command of King Kapchack's army,\nand will supersede Ki Ki, the hawk, upon the third day. On that day he\nwill lead forth the army to the south, professing to go upon a flank\nmarch, and to take you in the rear. Be not deceived by this movement,\nbut so soon as you see that the guards are withdrawn from the frontier,\ncross the border in force, and proceed straight towards the palace. When\nKapchack's army finds you between it and its base of supplies it will\ndisperse, and you will obtain an easy victory.\n\n\"'And in proof of his good-will towards you, the weasel, furthermore,\nbade me inform you of the great secret which has hitherto been preserved\nwith such care, and which will enable your army to remain in this place\nall the winter. In the squirrel's copse there is a spring, which is\nnever frozen, but always affords excellent drinking water, and moistens\na considerable extent of ground.'\" This was the weasel's message, and\nwithout a moment's delay the humble-bee buzzed away direct to Choo Hoo's\ncamp.\n\nAt the same time the fly with the mole's message reached Ki Ki, the\nhawk, as he was soaring among the clouds. Ki Ki, having finished his\nobservations, and full of suspicions as to the object with which the\nking had despatched the thrush to Choo Hoo, decided to keep the mole's\nappointment at once, so down he flew direct to the leaning stone in the\nmeadow, where Bevis had gathered the cowslips, and found the mole\nalready waiting for him.\n\nNow, the mole hated Ki Ki exceedingly, because, as previously related,\nhe had killed his wife, but he hated the weasel, who had persecuted him\nall his life, even more, and by thus betraying the weasel to the hawk he\nhoped to set the two traitors by the ears, and to gratify his own\nvengeance by seeing them tear each other to pieces. Accordingly he now\ninformed Ki Ki of everything--how the weasel had disclosed the names of\nall those who attended the secret meeting (except one, _i.e._, the owl,\nwhich, for reasons of his own, the weasel had suppressed), particularly\nstating that Ki Ki had taken a foremost part, that Kapchack was enraged\nagainst the hawk, and had already promised the weasel the chief command,\nso that in three days Ki Ki would be superseded.\n\nKi Ki, suppressing his agitation, thanked the mole very cordially for\nhis trouble, and soared towards the sky, but he had scarce gone a\nhundred yards before one of Kapchack's body-guard met him with a message\nfrom the king countermanding the advance of the army which had been\ndecided upon. Ki Ki replied that his majesty's orders should be\nimplicitly obeyed and continued his upward flight. He had now no doubt\nthat what the mole had told him was correct in every particular, since\nit had been so immediately confirmed; and as for the thrush, it seemed\nclear that Kapchack had some design of saving himself by the sacrifice\nof his friends. That must be his reasons for countermanding the\nadvance--to give time for negotiation. Angry beyond measure, Ki Ki flew\nto his own clump of trees, and calling to him a keen young hawk--one of\nhis guard, and who was only too delighted to be selected for\nconfidential employment--sent him with a flag of truce to Choo Hoo.\n\nHe was to say that Ki Ki, being disgusted with the treachery of King\nKapchack, had determined to abandon his cause, and that on the day of\nbattle, in the midst of the confusion, if Choo Hoo would push forward\nrapidly, Ki Ki would draw off his contingent and expose the centre, when\nKapchack must inevitably be destroyed. Away flew the hawk, and thus in\none hour Choo Hoo received three messengers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. TRAITORS.\n\n\nThe first that arrived was the thrush, hearing the message from the\nking. Choo Hoo, delighted beyond expression at so pleasant a solution of\nthe business, which he knew must, if it came to battle, entail great\nslaughter of his friends, received the thrush with the highest honours,\ncalled his principal counsellors around him, and acceded to everything\nKing Kapchack had proposed. The territory should be equally divided:\nChoo Hoo to have the plains, and Kapchack the woods and hills, and peace\nshould be proclaimed, Choo Hoo engaging to support Kapchack against all\ndomestic enemies and traitors. This treaty having been completed, the\nthrush made as if about to depart, but Choo Hoo would in no wise permit\nthis. \"Remain with us,\" he said, \"my dear Thrush, till the evening;\nfeast and make merry.\"\n\nSo the thrush was surrounded with a guard of honour, and conducted to\nthe choicest feeding places, and regaled upon the fat of the land. Thus\nenjoying himself, he thought it was the happiest day of his life, and\nwas not at all desirous of seeing the shadows lengthen.\n\nHardly had the thrush gone with his guard to the banquet, than the\nhumble-bee was announced, bearing the message from the weasel. To this\nthe assembled counsellors listened attentively, but Choo Hoo, being only\na barbarian, could on no account break faith, but was resolved to carry\nout his compact with King Kapchack. Nevertheless, he reflected that the\nking was extremely cunning, and not altogether to be relied upon (the\nhumble-bee, for aught he knew, might have been in reality sent by\nKapchack to try him), and therefore he would go so far as this, he would\nencourage the weasel without committing himself. \"Return,\" he said to\nthe humble-bee, \"return to him who sent you, and say: 'Do you do your\npart, and Choo Hoo will certainly do his part'.\" With which ambiguous\nsentence (which of course the weasel read in his own sense) he dismissed\nthe humble-bee, who had scarce departed from the camp, than the flag of\ntruce arrived from Ki Ki, and the young hawk, bright and defiant in his\nbearing, was admitted to the great Emperor Choo Hoo.\n\nWhen the council heard his message they all cried with one accord:\n\"Koos-takke! koos-takke! the enemy are confounded; they are divided\nagainst each other. They are delivered over to us. Koos-takke!\"\n\nSo soon as there was silence, Choo Hoo said:--\n\n\"Young sir, tell your master that we do not need his assistance,\" and he\nwaved the messenger to depart.\n\nBut the hawk said: \"Mighty emperor, consider that I am young, and that\nif I go to my master with so curt a message, you know that he is fierce\nbeyond reason, and I shall infallibly be torn to pieces\".\n\n\"Very well,\" said Choo Hoo, speaking in a harsh tone of voice, for he\nhated the whole race of hawks, and could scarce respect the flag of\ntruce, \"very well, tell your master the reason I do not want his\nassistance is, first, because Kapchack and I have concluded a treaty;\nsecondly, because the weasel has been before him, and has told me where\nthe secret spring is in the squirrel's copse--the spring that does not\nfreeze in winter.\"\n\nThe hawk, not daring to parley further with the emperor, bowed his way\nout, and went direct to Ki Ki with this reply.\n\nAll the council of Choo Hoo rejoiced exceedingly, both at the treaty\nwhich assured so peaceful and pleasant a conclusion to their arduous\nlabours, and to a sanguinary war which had lasted so many years, and in\nwhich they had lost so many of their bravest, and also at the treachery\nwhich prevailed in Kapchack's palace and confounded his efforts. They\ncried \"Koos-takke!\" and the shout was caught up throughout the camp with\nsuch vehemence that the woods echoed to the mysterious sound.\n\nNow the young hawk, winging his way swiftly through the air, soon\narrived at the trees where Ki Ki was waiting for him, and delivered the\nanswer in fear and trembling, expecting every moment to be dashed to the\nground and despatched. Ki Ki, however, said nothing, but listened in\nsilence, and then sat a long time thinking.\n\nPresently he said: \"You have done ill, and have not given much promise\nof your future success; you should not have taken Choo Hoo's answer so\nquickly. You should have argued with him, and used your persuasive\npowers. Moreover, being thus admitted to the very presence of our\ngreatest enemy, and standing face to face with him, and within a few\ninches of his breast, you should have known what it was your business to\ndo. I could not tell you beforehand, because it would have been against\nmy dignity to seem to participate before the deed in things of that\nkind. To you the opportunity was afforded, but you had not the ready wit\neither to see or to seize it.\n\n\"While Choo Hoo was deliberating you should have flown at his breast,\nand despatched the archrebel with one blow of your beak. In the\nconfusion you could have escaped with ease. Upon such a catastrophe\nbecoming known, the whole of Choo Hoo's army would have retreated, and\nhanging upon their rear we could have wreaked our wills upon them. As\nfor you, you would have obtained fame and power; as for me, I should\nhave retained the chief command; as for Kapchack, he would have rewarded\nyou with untold wealth. But you missed--you did not even see--this\ngolden opportunity, and you will never have another such a chance.\"\n\nAt this the young hawk hung his head, and could have beaten himself to\ndeath against the tree, in shame and sorrow at his folly.\n\n\"But,\" continued Ki Hi, \"as I see you are unfeignedly sorry, I will even\nyet entrust you with one more commission (the hawk began to brighten up\na little). You know that at the end of the Long Pond there is a very\nlarge wood which grows upon a slope; at the foot of the slope there is\nan open space or glade, which is a very convenient spot for an ambush.\nNow when the thrush comes home in the evening, bringing the treaty to\nKapchack, he is certain to pass that way, because it is the nearest, and\nthe most pleasant. Go there and stay in ambush till you hear him coming,\nthen swoop down and kill him, and tear his heart from his breast. Do not\nfail, or never return to my presence.\n\n\"And stay--you may be sure of the place I mean, because there is an old\noak in the midst of the glade, it is old and dead, and the route of the\nthrush will be under it. Strike him there.\"\n\nWithout waiting a moment, the hawk, knowing that his master liked\ninstant obedience, flew off swift as the wind, determined this time to\nsucceed. He found the glade without trouble, and noted the old oak with\nits dead gaunt boughs, and then took up his station on an ash, where he\nwatched eagerly for the shadows to lengthen. Ki Ki, after sitting a\nlittle longer, soared up into the sky to reflect upon further measures.\nBy destroying the thrush he knew that the war must continue, for Choo\nHoo would never believe but that it had been done by Kapchack's order,\nand could not forgive so brutal an affront to an ambassador charged with\na solemn treaty. Choo Hoo must then accept his (Ki Ki's) offer; the\nweasel, it was true, had been before him, but he should be able to\ndestroy the weasel's influence by revealing his treachery to Kapchack,\nand how he had told Choo Hoo the secret of the spring which was never\nfrozen. He felt certain that he should be able to make his own terms,\nboth with Kapchack and Choo Hoo.\n\nThus soaring up he saw his messenger, the young hawk, swiftly speeding\nto the ambush, and smiled grimly as he noted the eager haste with which\nthe youthful warrior went to fulfil his orders. Still soaring, with\noutstretched wings, he sought the upper sky.\n\nMeantime Bevis had grown tired of waiting for the squirrel, who had gone\noff to see about the stores, and flung himself at full length on the\nmoss under the oak. He hardly stopped there a minute before he got up\nagain and called and shouted for the squirrel, but no one answered him;\nnor did the dragon-fly appear. Bevis, weary of waiting, determined to\ntry and find his way home by himself, but when he came to look round he\ncould not discover the passage through the thicket. As he was searching\nfor it he passed the elm, which was hollow inside, where the weasel lay\ncurled up on his divan, and the weasel, hearing Bevis go by, was so\npuffed up with pride that he actually called to him, having conceived a\ndesign of using Bevis for his own purposes.\n\n\"Sir Bevis! Sir Bevis!\" he said, coming to the mouth of his hole, \"Sir\nBevis, I want to speak to you!\"\n\n\"You are the weasel,\" said Bevis, \"I know your hateful voice--I hate\nyou, and if ever I find you outside the copse I will smash you into\ntwenty pieces. If it was not for the squirrel, whom I love (and I have\npromised not to hurt anything in his copse), I would bring my papa's\nhatchet, and chop your tree down and cut your head off; so there.\"\n\n\"If you did that,\" said the weasel, \"then you would not know what the\nrat is going to do in your house to-night.\"\n\n\"Why should I not know?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Because if you cut my head off I could not tell you.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me what it is,\" said Bevis, who was always very curious,\n\"and make haste about it, for I want to go home.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said the weasel, \"and first of all, you know the fine large\ncake that your mamma is making for you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bevis, excitedly. \"Is she making me a cake? I did not know\nit.\"\n\n\"Yes, that she is, but she did not tell you, because she wished it to be\na surprise to you to-morrow morning at lunch, and it is no use for you\nto ask her about it, for she would not tell you. But if you are not very\nsharp it is certain that you will never touch a mouthful of it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Because,\" said the weasel, \"the mouse has found out where your mamma\nhas put it in the cupboard, and there is a little chink through which\nhe can smell it, but he cannot quite get through, nor is he strong\nenough to gnaw such very hard wood, else you may depend he would have\nkept the secret to himself. But as he could not creep through he has\ngone and told Raoul, the rat, who has such strong teeth he can bite a\nway through anything, and to-night, when you are all in bed and firm\nasleep, and everything is quiet, Yish, the mouse, is going to show the\nrat where the chink is, the rat is going to gnaw a hole, and in the\nmorning there will be very little left of your cake.\"\n\n\"I will tell the bailiff,\" said Bevis, in a rage, \"and the bailiff shall\nset a trap for the rat.\"\n\n\"Well, that was what I was going to suggest,\" said the weasel; \"but upon\nconsideration I am not so sure that it is much use telling the bailiff,\nbecause, as I daresay you recollect, the bailiff has often tried his\nhand setting up a trap for the rat, but has never yet caught him, from\nwhich I conclude that the rat knows all the places where the bailiff\nsets the trap, and takes good care not to go that way without previous\nexamination.\"\n\n\"I'll set up the trap,\" said Bevis, \"I'll set it up myself in a new\nplace. Let me see, where can I put it?\"\n\n\"I think it would be a very good plan if you did put it up yourself,\"\nsaid the weasel, \"because there is no doubt you understand more about\nthese things than the bailiff, who is getting old.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bevis, \"I know all about it--I can do it very well indeed.\"\n\n\"Just what I thought,\" said the weasel; \"I thought to myself, Bevis\nknows all about it--Bevis can do it. Now, as the bailiff has set up the\ntrap by the drain or grating beside the cart-house, and under the\nwood-pile, and by the pump, and has never caught the rat, it is clear\nthat the rat knows these places as well as the bailiff, and if you\nremember there is a good deal of grass grows there, so that the rat no\ndoubt says to himself: 'Aha! They are sure to put the trap here, because\nthey think I shall not see it in the grass--as if I was so silly.' So\nthat, depend upon it, he is always very careful how he goes through the\ngrass there.\n\n\"Therefore I think the best place you could select to set up the trap\nwould be somewhere where there is no kind of cover, no grass, nor\nanything, where it is quite bare and open, and where the rat would run\nalong quickly and never think of any danger. And he would be sure to run\nmuch faster and not stay to look under his feet in crossing such places,\nlest Pan should see him and give chase, or your papa should come round\nthe corner with a gun. Now I know there is one such place the rat passes\nevery evening; it is a favourite path of his, because it is a short cut\nto the stable--it is under the wall of the pig-sty. I know this, because\nI once lived with the rat a little while, and saw all his habits.\n\n\"Well, under this wall it is quite open, and he always runs by extremely\nfast, and that is the best place to put the trap. Now when you have set\nthe trap, in order to hide it from view do you get your little spade\nwith which you dig in your garden, and take a spadeful of the dust that\nlies about there (as it is so dry there is plenty of dust) and throw it\nover the trap. The dust will hide the trap, and will also prevent the\nrat (for he has a wonderful sharp nose of his own) from scenting where\nyour fingers touched it. In the morning you are sure to find him caught.\n\n\"By-the-by, you had better not say anything to your mamma that you know\nof the cake, else perhaps she will move it from the cupboard, and then\nthe rat may go on some other moonlit ramble instead. As I said, in the\nmorning you are sure to find him in the trap, and then do not listen to\nanything he has to say, for he has a lying tongue, but let Pan loose,\nwho will instantly worry him to death.\"\n\n\"I will do as you say,\" said Bevis, \"for I see that it is a very clever\nway to catch the rat, but, Sir Weasel, you have told me so many false\nstories that I can scarce believe you now it is plain you are telling me\nthe truth; nor shall I feel certain that you are this time (for once in\nyour wicked life) saying the truth, unless I know why you are so anxious\nfor the rat to be caught.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the weasel, \"I will tell you the reason; this afternoon the\nrat played me a very mean and scurvy trick; he disgraced me before the\nking, and made me a common laughing-stock to all the council, for which\nI swore to have his life. Besides, upon one occasion he bit his teeth\nright through my ear--the marks of it are there still. See for\nyourself.\" So the weasel thrust his head out of his hole, and Bevis saw\nthe marks left by the rat's teeth, and was convinced that the weasel,\nout of malice, had at last been able for once to tell the truth.\n\n\"You are a horrid wretch,\" said Bevis, \"still you know how to catch the\nrat, and I will go home and do it; but I cannot find my way out of this\nthicket--the squirrel ought to come.\"\n\n\"The way is under the ash bough there,\" said the weasel, \"and when you\nare outside the thicket turn to your left and go downhill, and you will\ncome to the timber--and meantime I will send for the dragon-fly, who\nwill overtake you.\"\n\n\"All right, horrid wretch,\" said Bevis, and away he went. Now all this\nthat the weasel had said really was true, except about the cake; it was\ntrue that the rat was very careful going through the grass, and that he\nknew where the bailiff set the gin, and that he used to run very quickly\nacross the exposed place under the wall of the pig-sty. But the story\nabout the cake he had made up out of his cunning head just to set Bevis\nat work to put up the trap; and he hoped too, that while Bevis was\nsetting up the gin, the spring would slip and pinch his fingers.\n\nBy thus catching the rat, the weasel meant in the first place to gratify\nhis own personal malice, and next to get rid of a very formidable\ncompetitor. For the rat was very large and very strong, and brave and\nbold beyond all the others; so much so that the weasel would even have\npreferred to have a struggle with the fox (though he was so much\nbigger), whose nostril he could bite, than to meet the rat in fair and\nequal combat. Besides, he hated the rat beyond measure, because the rat\nhad helped him out of the drain, which was when his ear was bitten\nthrough. He intended to go down to the farmyard very early next morning\nwhen the rat was caught, and to go as near as he dared and taunt the\nrat, and tell him how Pan would presently come and crunch up his ribs.\nTo see the rat twist, and hear him groan, would be rare sport; it made\nhis eyes glisten to think of it. He was very desirous that Bevis should\nfind his way home all right, so he at once sent a wasp for the\ndragon-fly, and the dragon-fly at once started after Bevis.\n\nJust after the weasel had sent the wasp, the humble-bee returned from\nChoo Hoo, and delivered the emperor's message, which the weasel saw at\nonce was intended to encourage him in his proposed treachery. He thanked\nthe humble-bee for the care and speed with which his errand had been\naccomplished, and then curled himself up on his divan to go to sleep, so\nas to be ready to go down early in the morning and torment the rat. As\nhe was very happy since his schemes were prospering, he went to sleep in\na minute as comfortable as could be.\n\nBevis crept through the thicket, and turned to the left, and went down\nthe hill, and found the timber, and then went along the green track till\nhe came to the stile. He got over the bridge and followed the footpath,\nwhen the dragon-fly overtook him and apologised most sincerely for his\nneglect. \"For,\" said he, \"we are so busy making ready for the army, and\nI have had so much to do going to and fro with messages, that, my dear\nSir Bevis, you must forgive me for forgetting you. Next time I will send\na moth to stay close by you, so that the moment you want me the moth can\ngo and fetch me.\"\n\n\"I will forgive you just this once,\" said Bevis; and the dragon-fly took\nhim all the way home. After tea Bevis went and found the gin, and tried\nto set it up under the pig-sty wall, just as the weasel had told him;\nbut at first he could not quite manage it, being as usual in such a\nhurry.\n\nNow there was a snail on the wall, and the snail looked out of his shell\nand said: \"Sir Bevis, do not be too quick. Believe me, if you are too\nquick to-day you are sure to be sorry to-morrow.\"\n\n\"You are a stupid snail,\" said Bevis. Just then, as the weasel had\nhoped, he pinched his fingers with the spring so hard that tears almost\ncame into his eyes.\n\n\"That was your fault,\" he said to the snail; and snatching the poor\nthing off the wall, he flung him ever so far; fortunately the snail fell\non the grass, and was not hurt, but he said to himself that in future,\nno matter what he saw going on, he would never interfere, but let people\nhurt themselves as much as they liked. But Bevis, though he was so\nhasty, was also very persevering, and presently he succeeded in setting\nup the trap, and then taking his spade he spread the dust over it and so\nhid it as the weasel had told him to. He then went and put his spade\nback in the summer-house, and having told Pan that in the morning there\nwould be a fine big rat for him to worry, went indoors.\n\nNow it is most probable that what the weasel had arranged so well would\nall have happened just as he foresaw, and that the trap so cleverly set\nup would have caught the rat, had not the bailiff, when he came home\nfrom the fields, chanced to see Bevis doing it. He had to attend to\nsomething else then, but by-and-by, when he had finished, he went and\nlooked at the place where Bevis had set the gin, and said to himself:\n\"Well, it is a very good plan to set up the gin, for the rat is always\ntaking the pigs' food, and even had a gnaw at my luncheon, which was\ntied up in my handkerchief, and which I--like a stupid--left on the\nground in my hurry instead of hanging up. But it is a pity Sir Bevis\nshould have set it here, for there is no grass or cover, and the rat is\ncertain to see it, and Bevis will be disappointed in the morning, and\nwill not find the rat. Now I will just move the gin to a place where the\nrat always comes, and where it will be hidden by the grass, that is,\njust at the mouth of the drain by the cart-house; it will catch the rat\nthere, and Sir Bevis will be pleased.\"\n\nSo the bailiff, having thought this to himself, as he leant against the\nwall, and listened to the pigs snoring, carefully took up the gin and\nmoved it down to the mouth of the drain by the cart-house, and there set\nit up in the grass.\n\nThe rat was in the drain, and when he heard the bailiff's heavy\nfootsteps, and the noise he made fumbling about with the trap, he\nlaughed, and said to himself: \"Fumble away, you old stupid--I know what\nyou are doing. You are setting up a gin in the same place you have set\nit twenty times before. Twenty times you have set the gin up there and\nnever caught anything, and yet you cannot see, and you cannot\nunderstand, and you never learn anything, and you are the biggest dolt\nand idiot that ever walked, or rather, you would be, only I thank heaven\neverybody else is just like you! As if I could not hear what you are\ndoing; as if I did not look very carefully before I come out of my hole,\nand before I put my foot down on grass or leaves, and as if I could not\nsmell your great clumsy fingers: really I feel insulted that you should\ntreat me as if I was so foolish. However, upon the whole, this is rather\nnice and considerate of you. Ha! Ha!\" and the rat laughed so loud that\nif the bailiff had been sharp he must have heard this unusual chuckling\nin the drain. But he heard nothing, but went off down the road very\ncontented with himself, whistling a bar from \"Madame Angôt\" which he had\nlearnt from Bevis.\n\nWhen Bevis went to bed he just peeped out of the window to look at the\nmoon, but the sky was now overcast, and the clouds were hurrying by, and\nthe wind rising--which the snail had expected, or he would not have\nventured out along the wall. While Bevis was peeping out he saw the owl\ngo by over the orchard and up beside the hedge.\n\nThe very same evening the young hawk, as has been previously related,\nhad gone to the glade in the wood, and sat there in ambush waiting for\nthe thrush. Like Sir Bevis, the hawk was extremely impatient, and the\ntime as he sat on the ash passed very slowly till at last he observed\nwith much delight that the sun was declining, and that the shadow of the\ndead oak-tree would soon reach across towards him.\n\nThe thrush, having sat at the banquet the whole of the afternoon, and\ntasted every dainty that the camp of Choo Hoo afforded, surrounded all\nthe time by crowds of pleasant companions, on the other hand, saw the\nshadows lengthening with regret. He knew that it was time for him to\ndepart and convey the intelligence to King Kapchack that Choo Hoo had\nfully agreed to his proposal. Still loth to leave he lingered, and it\nwas not until dusk that he quitted the camp, accompanied a little way\nover the frontier by some of Choo Hoo's chief counsellors, who sought in\nevery way to do him honour. Then wishing him good-night, with many\ninvitations to return shortly, they left him to pursue his journey.\n\nKnowing that he ought to have returned to the king before this, the\nthrush put forth his best speed, and thought to himself as he flew what\na long account he should have to give his wife and his children (who\nwere now grown up) of the high and important negotiation with which he\nhad been entrusted, and of the attentions that had been paid to him by\nthe emperor. Happy in these anticipations, he passed rapidly over the\nfields and the woods, when just as he flew beneath the old dead oak in\nthe glade down swooped the hawk and bore him to the ground. In an\ninstant a sharp beak was driven into his head, and then, while yet his\nbody quivered, the feathers were plucked from his breast and his heart\nlaid bare. Hungry from his fast, for he had touched nothing that day,\nbeing so occupied with his master's business, the hawk picked the bones,\nand then, after the manner of his kind, wishing to clean his beak, flew\nup and perched on a large dead bough of the oak just overhead.\n\nThe moment he perched, a steel trap which had been set there by the\nkeeper flew up and caught him, with such force that his limbs were\nbroken. With a shriek the hawk flapped his wings to fly, but this only\npulled his torn and bleeding legs, and overcome with the agony, he\nfainted, and hung head downwards from the bough, suspended by his\nsinews. Now this was exactly what Ki Ki had foreseen would happen. There\nwere a hundred places along the thrush's route where an ambush might\nhave been placed, as well as in the glade, but Ki Ki had observed that a\ntrap was set upon the old dead oak, and ordered his servant to strike\nthe thrush there, so that he might step into it afterwards, thus killing\ntwo birds with one stone.\n\nHe desired the death of his servant lest he should tell tales, and let\nout the secret mission upon which he had been employed, or lest he\nshould boast, in the vain glory of youth, of having slain the\nambassador. Cruel as he was, Ki Ki, too, thought of the torture the\nyoung hawk would endure with delight, and said to himself that it was\nhardly an adequate punishment for having neglected so golden an\nopportunity for assassinating Choo Hoo. From the fate of the thrush and\nthe youthful hawk, it would indeed appear that it is not always safe to\nbe employed upon secret business of state. Yet Ki Ki, with all his cruel\ncunning, was not wholly successful.\n\nFor the owl, as he went his evening rounds, after he had flown over the\norchard where Bevis saw him, went on up the hedge by the meadow, and\nskirting the shore of the Long Pond, presently entered the wood and\nglided across the glade towards the dead oak-tree, which was one of his\nfavourite haunts. As he came near he was horrified to hear miserable\ngroans and moans, and incoherent talking, and directly afterwards saw\nthe poor hawk hanging head downwards. He had recovered his consciousness\nonly to feel again the pressure of the steel, and the sharp pain of his\nbroken limbs, which presently sent him into a delirium.\n\nThe owl circling round the tree was so overcome by the spectacle that he\ntoo nearly fainted, and said to himself: \"It is clear that my lucky star\nrose to-night, for without a doubt the trap was intended for me. I have\nperched on that very bough every evening for weeks, and I should have\nalighted there to-night had not the hawk been before me. I have escaped\nfrom the most terrible fate which ever befell any one, to which indeed\ncrucifixion, with an iron nail through the brain, is mercy itself, for\nthat is over in a minute, but this miserable creature will linger till\nthe morning.\"\n\nSo saying, he felt so faint that (first looking very carefully to see\nthat there were no more traps) he perched on a bough a little way above\nthe hawk. The hawk, in his delirium, was talking of all that he had done\nand heard that day, reviling Ki Ki and Choo Hoo, imploring destruction\nupon his master's head, and then flapping his wings and so tearing his\nsinews and grinding his broken bones together, he shrieked with pain.\nThen again he went on talking about the treaty, and the weasel's\ntreason, and the assassination of the ambassador. The owl, sitting close\nby, heard all these things, and after a time came to understand what the\nhawk meant; at first he could not believe that his master, the king,\nwould conclude a treaty without first consulting him, but looking\nunderneath him he saw the feathers of the thrush scattered on the grass,\nand could no longer doubt that what the hawk said was true.\n\nBut when he heard the story of Ki Ki's promised treason on the day of\nbattle, when he heard that the weasel had betrayed the secret of the\nspring, which did not freeze in winter, he lifted up his claw and opened\nhis eyes still wider in amazement and terror. \"Wretched creature!\" he\nsaid, \"what is this you have been saying.\" But the hawk, quite mad with\nagony, did not know him, but mistook him for Ki Ki, and poured out such\nterrible denunciations that the owl, shocked beyond measure, flew away.\n\nAs he went, after he had gone some distance under the trees, and could\nno longer hear the ravings of the tortured hawk, he began to ask himself\nwhat he had better do. At first he thought that he would say nothing,\nbut take measures to defeat these traitors. But presently it occurred to\nhim that it was dangerous even to know such things, and he wished that\nhe had never heard what the hawk had said. He reflected, too, that the\nbats had been flying about some time, and might have heard the hawk's\nconfessions, and although they were not admitted at court, as they\nbelonged to the lower orders, still under such circumstances they might\nobtain an audience. They had always borne him ill-will, they must have\nseen him, and it was not unlikely they might say that the owl knew all\nabout it, and kept it from the king. On the other hand, he thought that\nKapchack's rage would be terrible to face.\n\nUpon the whole, however, the owl came to the conclusion that his safest,\nas well as his most honourable course, was to go straight to the king,\nlate as it was, and communicate all that had thus come to his knowledge.\nHe set out at once, and upon his way again passed the glade, taking care\nnot to go too near the dead oak, nor to look towards the suspended hawk.\nHe saw a night-jar like a ghost wheeling to and fro not far from the\nscaffold, and anxious to get from the ill-omened spot, flew yet more\nswiftly. Round the wood he went, and along the hedges, so occupied with\nhis thoughts that he did not notice how the sky was covered with\nclouds, and once or twice narrowly escaping a branch blown off by the\nwind which had risen to a gale. Nor did he see the fox with his brush\ntouching the ground, creeping unhappily along the mound, but never\nlooked to the right nor left, hastening as fast as he could glide to\nKing Kapchack.\n\nNow the king had waited up that night as long as ever he could,\nwondering why the thrush did not return, and growing more and more\nanxious about the ambassador every moment. Yet he was unable to imagine\nwhat could delay him, nor could he see how any ill could befall him,\nprotected as he was by the privileges of his office. As the night came\non, and the ambassador did not come, Kapchack, worn out with anxieties,\nsnapped at his attendants, who retired to a little distance, for they\nfeared the monarch in these fits of temper.\n\nKapchack had just fallen asleep when the owl arrived, and the attendants\nobjected to letting him see the king. But the owl insisted, saying that\nit was his particular privilege as chief secretary of state to be\nadmitted to audience at any moment. With some difficulty, therefore, he\nat last got to the king, who woke up in a rage, and stormed at his\nfaithful counsellor with such fury that the attendants again retired in\naffright. But the owl stood his ground and told his tale.\n\nWhen King Kapchack heard that his ambassador had been foully\nassassinated, and that, therefore, the treaty was at an end--for Choo\nHoo would never brook such an affront; when he heard that Ki Ki, his\ntrusted Ki Ki, who had the command, had offered to retreat in the hour\nof battle, and expose him to be taken prisoner; when he heard that the\nweasel, the weasel whom that very afternoon he had restored to his\nhighest favour, had revealed to the enemy the existence of the spring,\nhe lost all his spirit, and he knew not what to do. He waved the owl\nfrom his presence, and sat alone hanging his head, utterly overcome.\n\nThe clouds grew darker, the wind howled, the trees creaked, and the\nbranches cracked (the snail had foreseen the storm and had ventured\nforth on the wall), a few spots of rain came driving along. Kapchack\nheard nothing. He was deserted by all: all had turned traitors against\nhim, every one. He who had himself deceived all was now deceived by all,\nand suffered the keenest pangs. Thus, in dolour and despair the darkness\nincreased, and the tempest howled about him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE STORM IN THE NIGHT.\n\n\nWhen the fox, after humbling himself in the dust, was rudely dismissed\nby King Kapchack, he was so mortified, that as he slunk away his brush\ntouched the ground, and the tip of his nostrils turned almost white.\nThat he, whose ancestors had once held regal dignity, should thus be\ncontemned by one who in comparison was a mere upstart, and that, too,\nafter doing him a service by means of the gnat, and after bowing\nhimself, as it were, to the ground, hurt him to his soul. He went away\nthrough the fern and the bushes to his lair in the long grass which grew\nin a corner of the copse, and having curled himself up, tried to forget\nthe insult in slumber.\n\nBut he could not shut his eyes, and after a while he went off again down\nthe hedgerow to another place where he sometimes stayed, under thick\nbrambles on a broad mound. But he could not rest there, nor in the osier\nbed, nor in the furze, but he kept moving from place to place all day,\ncontrary to his custom, and not without running great danger. The sting\nlingered in him, and the more so because he felt that it was true--he\nknew himself that he had not shown any ability lately. Slowly the long\nday passed, the shadows lengthened and it became night. Still\nrestlessly and aimlessly wandering he went about the fields noticing\nnothing, but miserable to the last degree. The owl flew by on his errand\nto King Kapchack; the bats fluttered overhead; the wind blew and the\ntrees creaked; but the fox neither saw, nor heard, nor thought of\nanything except his own degradation. He had been cast forth as\nunworthy--even the very mouse had received some instructions, but he,\nthe descendant of illustrious ancestors, was pointedly told that the wit\nfor which they had been famous did not exist in him.\n\nAs the night drew on, the wind rose higher, the clouds became thicker\nand darker, the branches crashed to the earth, the tempest rushed along\nbearing everything before it. The owls, alarmed for their safety, hid in\nthe hollow trees, or retired to their barns; the bats retreated into the\ncrevices of the tiles; nothing was abroad but the wildfowl, whose cries\noccasionally resounded overhead. Now and then, the fall of some branch\ninto a hawthorn bush frightened the sleeping thrushes and blackbirds,\nwho flew forth into the darkness, not knowing whither they were going.\nThe rabbits crouched on the sheltered side of the hedges, and then went\nback into their holes. The larks cowered closer to the earth.\n\nRuin and destruction raged around: in Choo Hoo's camp the ash poles beat\nagainst each other, oaks were rent, and his vast army knew no sleep that\nnight. Whirled about by the fearful gusts, the dying hawk, suspended\nfrom the trap, no longer fluttered, but swung unconscious to and fro.\nThe feathers of the murdered thrush were scattered afar, and the leaves\ntorn from the boughs went sweeping after them. Alone in the scene the\nfox raced along, something of the wildness of the night entered into\nhim; he tried, by putting forth his utmost speed, to throw off the sense\nof ignominy.\n\nIn the darkness, and in his distress of mind, he neither knew or cared\nwhither he was going. He passed the shore of the Long Pond, and heard\nthe waves dashing on the stones, and felt the spray driven far up on the\nsward. He passed the miserable hawk. He ran like the wind by the camp of\nChoo Hoo, and heard the hum of the army, unable to sleep. Weary at last,\nhe sought for some spot into which to drag his limbs, and crept along a\nmound which, although he did not recognise it in his stupefied state of\nmind, was really not far from where he had started. As he was creeping\nalong, he fancied he heard a voice which came from the ground beneath\nhis feet; it sounded so strange in the darkness that he started and\nstayed to listen.\n\nHe heard it again, but though he thought he knew the voices of all the\nresidents in the field, he could not tell who it was, nor whence it\ncame. But after a time he found that it proceeded from the lower part or\nbutt of an elm-tree. This tree was very large, and seemed perfectly\nsound, but it seems there was a crack in it, whether caused by lightning\nor not he did not know, which did not show at ordinary times. But when\nthe wind blew extremely strong as it did to-night, the tree leant over\nbefore the blast, and thus opened the crack. The fox, listening at the\ncrack, heard the voice lamenting the long years that had passed, the\ndarkness and the dreary time, and imploring every species of vengeance\nupon the head of the cruel King Kapchack.\n\nAfter a while the fox came to the conclusion that this must be the toad\nwho, very many years ago, for some offence committed against the state,\nwas imprisoned by Kapchack's orders in the butt of an elm, there to\nremain till the end of the world. Curious to know why the toad had been\npunished in this terrible manner, the fox resolved to speak to the\nprisoner, from whom perhaps he might learn something to Kapchack's\ndisadvantage. Waiting, therefore, till the crack opened as the gust\ncame, the fox spoke into it, and the toad, only too delighted to get\nsome one to talk to at last, replied directly.\n\nBut the chink was so small that his voice was scarcely audible; the\nchink, too, only opened for a second or two during the savage puffs of\nthe gale, and then closed again, so that connected conversation was not\npossible, and all the fox heard was that the toad had some very\nimportant things to say. Anxious to learn these things, the fox tried\nhis hardest to discover some way of communicating with the toad, and at\nlast he hit upon a plan. He looked round till he found a little bit of\nflint, which he picked up, and when the elm bent over before the gale,\nand the chink opened, he pushed the splinter of flint into the crevice.\n\nThen he found another piece of flint just a trifle larger, and, watching\nhis opportunity, thrust it in. This he did three or four times, each\ntime putting in a larger wedge, till there was a crack sufficiently open\nto allow him to talk to the toad easily. The toad said that this was the\nfirst time he had spoken to anybody since his grandson, who lived in the\nrhubarb patch, came to exchange a word with him before the butt of the\ntree grew quite round him.\n\nBut though the fox plied him with questions, and persuaded him in every\nway, he would not reveal the reason why he was imprisoned, except that\nhe had unluckily seen Kapchack do something. He dared not say what it\nwas, because if he did he had no doubt he would be immediately put to\ndeath, and although life in the tree was no more than a living death,\nstill it was life, and he had this consolation, that through being\ndebarred from all exercise and work, and compelled to exist without\neating or drinking, notwithstanding the time passed and the years went\nby, still he did not grow any older. He was as young now as when he was\nfirst put into the dungeon, and if he could once get out, he felt that\nhe should soon recover the use of his limbs, and should crawl about and\nenjoy himself when his grandson who lived in the rhubarb patch, and who\nwas already very old and warty, was dead.\n\nIndeed by being thus shut up he should survive every other toad, and he\nhoped some day to get out, because although he had been condemned to\nimprisonment till the end of the world, that was only Kapchack's\nvainglorious way of pronouncing sentence, as if his (Kapchack's)\nauthority was going to endure for ever, which was quite contrary to\nhistory and the teachings of philosophy. So far from that he did not\nbelieve himself that Kapchack's dynasty was fated to endure very long,\nfor since he had been a prisoner immured in the earth, he had heard many\nstrange things whispered along underground, and among them a saying\nabout Kapchack. Besides which he knew that the elm-tree could not exist\nfor ever; already there was a crack in it, which in time would split\nfarther up; the elm had reached its prime, and was beginning to decay\nwithin. By-and-by it would be blown over, and then the farmer would have\nthe butt grubbed up, and split for firewood, and he should escape. It\nwas true it might be many years hence, perhaps a century, but that did\nnot matter in the least--time was nothing to him now--and he knew he\nshould emerge as young as when he went in.\n\nThis was the reason why he so carefully kept the secret of what he had\nseen, so as to preserve his life; nor could the fox by any persuasion\nprevail upon him to disclose the matter.\n\n\"But at least,\" said the fox, \"at least tell me the saying you have\nheard underground about King Kapchack.\"\n\n\"I am afraid to do so,\" said the toad; \"for having already suffered so\nmuch I dread the infliction of further misery.\"\n\n\"If you will tell me,\" said the fox, \"I will do my very best to get you\nout. I will keep putting in wedges till the tree splits wide open, so\nthat you may crawl up the chink.\"\n\n\"Will you,\" said the toad, excited at the hope of liberty, \"will you\nreally do that?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I will,\" said the fox; \"wait an instant, and I will fetch\nanother flint.\"\n\nSo he brought another flint which split the tree so much that the toad\nfelt the fresh air come down to him. \"And you really will do it?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated the fox, \"I will certainly let you out.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the toad, \"the saying I have heard underground is this:\n'When the hare hunts the hunter in the dead day, the hours of King\nKapchack are numbered'. It is a curious and a difficult saying, for I\ncannot myself understand how the day could be dead, nor how the hare\ncould chase the sportsman; but you, who have so high a reputation for\nsagacity, can no doubt in time interpret it. Now put in some more wedges\nand help me out.\"\n\nBut the fox, having learnt all that the toad could tell him, went away,\nand finding the osiers, curled himself up to sleep.\n\nThe same night, the weasel, having had a very pleasant nap upon his\ndivan in the elm in the squirrel's copse, woke up soon after midnight,\nand started for the farm, in order to enjoy the pleasure of seeing the\nrat in the gin, which he had instructed Bevis how to set up. Had it not\nbeen for this he would not have faced so terrible a tempest, but to see\nthe rat in torture he would have gone through anything. As he crept\nalong a furrow, not far outside the copse, choosing that route that he\nmight be somewhat sheltered in the hollow from the wind, he saw a wire\nwhich a poacher had set up, and stayed to consider how he could turn it\nto his advantage.\n\n\"There is Ulu, the hare,\" he said to himself, \"who lives in the\nwheat-field; I had her son, he was very sweet and tender, and also her\nnephew, who was not so juicy, and I have noticed that she has got very\nplump of late. She is up on the hill to-night I have no doubt,\nnotwithstanding the tempest, dancing and flirting with her disreputable\ncompanions, for vice has such an attraction for some minds that they\ncannot forego its pleasures, even at the utmost personal inconvenience.\nSuch revels, at such a time of tempest, while the wrath of heaven is\nwreaked upon the trees, are nothing short of sacrilege, and I for one\nhave always set my mind against irreverence. I shall do the world a\nservice if I rid it of such an abandoned creature.\" So he called to a\nmoor-hen, who was flying over from the Long Pond at a tremendous pace,\nbeing carried before the wind, and the moor-hen, not without a great\ndeal of trouble, managed to wheel round (she was never very clever with\nher wings) to receive his commands, for she did not dare to pass over or\nslight so high a personage.\n\n\"Moor-hen,\" said the weasel, \"do you go direct to the hills and find\nUlu, the hare, and tell her that little Sir Bevis, of whom she is so\nfond, is lost in the copse, and that he is crying bitterly because of\nthe darkness and the wind, and what will become of him I do not know. I\nhave done my very best to show him the way home, but he cherishes an\nunfortunate prejudice against me, and will not listen to what I say.\nTherefore if the hare does not come immediately and show him the way I\ngreatly fear that he will be knocked down by the branches, or cry his\ndear pretty darling heart out; and tell her that he is at this minute\nclose to the birches. Go quickly, Moor-hen.\"\n\n\"I will, my lord,\" said the moor-hen, and away she flew.\n\nThen the weasel proceeded on his way, and shortly afterwards arrived at\nthe farm. As he came quietly down from the rick-yard, he said to\nhimself: \"I will keep a good way from the wall, as it is so dark, and I\ndo not know the exact place where Bevis has put the trap. Besides, it is\njust possible that the rat may not yet have passed that way, for he does\nmost of his business in the early morning, and it is not yet dawn.\"\n\nSo he crossed over to the wood-pile and listened carefully, but could\nhear no groans, as he had expected; but, on consideration, he put this\ndown to the wind, which he observed blew the sound away from him. He\nthen slipped over to the grass by the cart-house wall, intending to\nlisten at the mouth of the drain to hear if the rat was within, and then\nif that was not the case, to go on along towards the wall of the\npig-sty, for he began to think the rat must have been stunned by the\ntrap, and so could not squeak.\n\nIf that was the case, he thought he would just bite off the end of the\nrat's tail, in revenge for the terrible meal he had once been obliged to\nmake upon his own, and also to wake up the rat to the misery of his\nposition. But just as he approached the mouth of the drain, sniffing and\nlistening with the utmost caution, it happened that a drop of rain fell\nthrough a chink in the top of Pan's tub, and woke him from his slumber.\nPan shook himself and turned round, and the weasel, hearing the\ndisturbance, dreaded lest Pan was loose, and had caught scent of him. He\ndarted forwards to get into the drain, when the trap, which the bailiff\nhad so carefully removed from where Bevis had set it, snapped him up in\na second. The shock and the pain made him faint; he turned over and lay\nstill.\n\nAbout the same time the moor-hen, borne swiftly along by the wind on her\nway to the river, reached the hills, and seeing the hare, flew low down\nand delivered the weasel's message as well as she could. The hare was\ndreadfully alarmed about Sir Bevis, and anxious to relieve him from his\nfright in the dark copse, raced down the hill, and over the fields as\nfast as she could go, making towards that part of the copse where the\nbirches stood, as the weasel had directed, knowing that in running there\nshe would find her neck in a noose.\n\nIt happened just as he had foreseen. She came along as fast as the wind,\nand could already see the copse like a thicker darkness before her, when\nthe loop of the wire drew up around her neck, and over she rolled in the\nfurrow.\n\nNow the weasel had hoped that the wire would not hang her at once. He\nintended to have come back from the farm, and from taunting the rat in\nthe trap, in time to put his teeth into her veins, before, in her\nconvulsive efforts to get free, she tightened the noose and died.\n\nAnd this, too, happened exactly as the weasel had intended, but in a\ndifferent manner, and with a different result; for it had chanced that\nthe wind, in the course of its ravages among the trees, snapped off a\ntwig of ash, which rolling over and over before the blast along the\nsward, came against the stick which upheld the wire, and the end of the\ntwig where it had broken from the tree lodged in the loop. Thus, when\nUlu kicked, and struggled, and screamed, in her fear, the noose indeed\ndrew up tight and half-strangled her, but not quite, because the little\npiece of wood prevented it. But, exhausted with pain and terror, and\npartially choked, the poor hare at last could do nothing else but crouch\ndown in the furrow, where the rain fell on and soaked her warm coat of\nfur. For as the dawn came on the wind sank, and the rain fell.\n\nIn this unhappy plight she passed the rest of the night, dreading every\nmoment lest the fox should come along (as she could not run away), and\nnot less afraid of the daybreak, when some one would certainly find her.\n\nAfter many weary hours, the bailiff coming to his work in the morning\nwith a sack over his shoulders to keep out the rain, saw something on\nthe grass, and pounced upon the wretched hare. Already his great thumb\nwas against the back of her neck--already she was thrown across his\nknee--already she felt her sinews stretch, as he proceeded to break her\nneck, regardless of her shrieks--when suddenly it occurred to him how\ndelighted Bevis would be with a living hare. For the bailiff was very\nfond of Bevis, and would have done anything to please him. So he took\nthe hare in his arms, and carried her down to the farm.\n\nWhen Bevis got up and came to breakfast, the bailiff came in and brought\nhim the hare, expecting that he would be highly pleased. But Bevis in an\ninstant recognised his friend who had shown him his way in the cowslips,\nand flew into a rage, and beat the bailiff with his fist for his\ncruelty. Nothing would satisfy him but he must let the hare go free\nbefore he touched his breakfast. He would not sit down, he stamped and\nmade such a to-do that at last they let him have his own way.\n\nHe would not even allow the bailiff to carry the hare for him; he took\nher in his arms and went with her up the footpath into the field. He\nwould not even permit them to follow him. Now, the hare knew him very\nwell but could not speak when any one else was near, for it is very well\nknown to be a law among hares and birds, and such creatures, that they\ncan only talk to one human being, and are dumb when more than one are\npresent. But when Bevis had taken her out into the footpath, and set her\ndown, and stroked her back, and her long ears, black at the tip, and had\ntold her to go straight up the footpath, and not through the long\ngrass, because it was wet with the rain, the hare told him how she came\nin the wire through the wicked weasel telling her that he was lost in\nthe copse.\n\n\"I was not lost,\" said Bevis; \"I went to bed, and saw the owl go by. The\nweasel told another of his stories--now, I remember, he told me to set\nthe trap for the rat.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" said the hare; \"then you may depend it is some more of his\ndreadful wickedness; there will be no peace in the world while he is\nallowed to go roaming about.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bevis, \"that there will not: but as sure as my papa's gun,\nwhich is the best gun in the country, as sure as my papa's gun I will\nkill him the next time I see him. I will not listen to the squirrel, I\nwill cut the weasel's tree down, and chop off his head.\"\n\n\"I hope you will, dear,\" said the hare. \"But now I must be gone, for I\ncan hear Pan barking, and no doubt he can smell me; besides which, it is\nbroad daylight, and I must go and hide; good-bye, my dear Sir Bevis.\"\nAnd away went the hare up the footpath till Bevis lost sight of her\nthrough the gateway.\n\nThen he went to his breakfast, and directly afterwards, putting on his\ngreatcoat, for it still rained a little, he went up to the wall by the\npig-sty expecting to find the rat in the trap. But the trap was gone.\n\n\"There now,\" said he, falling into another rage, twice already that\nmorning; \"I do believe that stupid bailiff has moved it,\" and so the\nbailiff trying to please him fell twice into disgrace in an hour.\n\nLooking about to see where the bailiff had put the trap, he remembered\nwhat the weasel had told him, and going to the cart-house wall by the\ndrain, found the trap and the weasel in it: \"Oh! you false and\ntreacherous creature!\" said Bevis, picking up a stone, \"now I will smash\nyou into seventy thousand little pieces,\" and he flung the stone with\nall his might, but being in too much of a hurry (as the snail had warned\nhim) it missed the mark, and only knocked a bit of mortar out of the\nwall. He looked round for a bigger one, so that he might crush the\nwretch this time, when the weasel feebly lifted his head, and said:\n\"Bevis! Bevis! It is not generous of you to bear such malice towards me\nnow I am dying; you should rather----\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, horrid thing,\" said Bevis; \"I will not listen to\nanything you have to say. Here is a brick, this will do, first-rate, to\npound you with, and now I think of it, I will come a little nearer so as\nto make quite sure.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bevis!\" said the weasel with a gasp, \"I shall be dead in a minute,\"\nand Bevis saw his head fall back.\n\n\"Tell the hare I repented,\" said the weasel. \"I have been very wicked,\nBevis--oh!--but I shall never, never do it any more--oh!----\"\n\n\"Are you dead?\" said Bevis. \"Are you quite dead?\" putting down the\nbrick, for he could not bear to see anything in such distress, and his\nrage was over in a minute.\n\n\"I am,\" said the weasel, \"at least I shall be in half-a-minute, for I\nmust be particular to tell the exact truth in this extremity. Oh! there\nis one thing I should like to say----\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"But if you smash me I can't,\" said the weasel; \"and what is the use of\nsmashing me, for all my bones are broken?\"\n\n\"I will not smash you,\" said Bevis, \"I will only have you nailed up to\nthe stable door so that everybody may see what a wretch you were.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the weasel, very gratefully, \"will you please tell the\nhare and all of them that if I could only live I would do everything I\ncould to make up to them, for all the wickedness I have\ncommitted--oh!--I have not got time to say all I would. Oh! Bevis,\nBevis!\"\n\n\"Yes, poor thing,\" said Bevis, now quite melted and sorry for the\nwretched criminal, whose life was ebbing so fast, \"what is it you want?\nI will be sure to do it.\"\n\n\"Then, dear Sir Bevis--how kind it is of you to forgive me, dear Sir\nBevis; when I am dead do not nail me to the door--only think how\nterrible that would be--bury me, dear.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Bevis; \"but perhaps you needn't die. Stay a little\nwhile, and let us see if you cannot live.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the weasel, \"my time is come. But when I am dead, dear,\nplease take me out of this cruel trap in which I am so justly caught,\nas I set it for another; take me out of this cruel trap which has broken\nmy ribs, and lay me flat on the grass, and pull my limbs out straight,\nso that I may not stiffen all in a heap and crooked. Then get your\nspade, my dear Sir Bevis, and dig a hole and bury me, and put a stone on\ntop of me, so that Pan cannot scratch me up--oh! oh!--will you--oh!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed I will. I will dig the hole--I have a capital spade,\" said\nBevis; \"stay a minute.\"\n\nBut the weasel gave three gasps and fell back quite dead. Bevis looked\nat him a little while, and then put his foot on the spring and pressed\nit down and took the weasel out. He stroked down his fur where the trap\nhad ruffled it, and rubbed the earth from his poor paws with which he\nhad struggled to get free, and then having chosen a spot close by the\nwood-pile, where the ground was soft, to dig the hole, he put the weasel\ndown there, and pulled his limbs out straight, and so disposed him for\nthe last sad ceremony. He then ran to the summer-house, which was not\nfar, and having found the spade came back with it to the wood-pile. But\nthe weasel was gone.\n\nThere was the trap; there was the place he had chosen--all the little\ntwigs and leaves brushed away ready for digging--but no weasel. He was\nbewildered, when a robin perched on the top of the wood-pile put his\nhead on one side, and said so softly and sadly: \"Bevis, Bevis, little\nSir Bevis, what have you done?\" For the weasel was not dead, and was not\neven very seriously injured; the trap was old, and the spring not very\nstrong, and the teeth did not quite meet. If the rat, who was fat, had\ngot in, it would have pinched him dreadfully, but the weasel was\nextremely thin, and so he escaped with a broken rib--the only true thing\nhe had said.\n\nSo soon as ever Sir Bevis's back was turned, the weasel crawled under\nthe wood-pile, just as he had done once before, and from there made his\nway as quickly as he could up the field sheltered by the aftermath,\nwhich had now grown long again. When Bevis understood that the weasel\nhad only shammed dying, and had really got away, he burst into tears,\nfor he could not bear to be cheated, and then threw his spade at the\nrobin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE OLD OAK.--THE KING'S DESPAIR.\n\n\nThe very same morning, after the rain had ceased, the keeper who looked\nafter the great woods at the other end of the Long Pond set out with his\ngun and his dogs to walk round the preserves. Now the dogs he took with\nhim were the very best dogs he had, for that night a young gentleman,\nwho had just succeeded to the estate, was coming down from London, and\non the following morning would be sure to go out shooting. This young\ngentleman had unexpectedly come into the property through the death of\nthe owner, who was shot in his bedroom by a burglar. The robber had once\nbeen his groom, and the squirrel told Bevis how it all happened through\na flint falling out of the hole in the bottom of the waggon which\nbelonged to the old farmer in whose orchard Kapchack had his palace.\n\nThe heir had been kept at a distance during the old gentleman's\nlifetime, for the old gentleman always meant to marry and have a son,\nbut did not do so, and also always meant to make a will and leave the\nbest part of his estate to somebody else, but he did not do so, and as\nthe old toad in the rhubarb patch told Bevis afterwards when he heard\nthe story, if you are only going to do a thing, it would be no use if\nyou lived a thousand years, it would always be just the same. So the\nyoung fellow, who had been poor all his life, when he thus suddenly\njumped into such a property, was not a little elated, and wrote to the\nkeeper that he should come down and have some shooting.\n\nThe keeper was rather alarmed at this, for the former owner was not a\nsporting man, and did not look strictly after such things, so that the\ngame had been neglected and had got scarce; and what was worse, the dogs\nwere out of training. He therefore got up early that morning, intending\nto go his rounds quickly, and then take the dogs out into the stubble,\nand try and thrash them into some use. Presently, as he walked along, he\ncame to the glade in the woods, and saw the dead hawk hanging from the\ntrap up in the old oak-tree. Pleased to find that his trap, so cunningly\nplaced, had not been prepared in vain, he went up to the oak, leaned his\ngun against the trunk, ordered the dogs to lie down (which they did with\nsome reluctance), and then climbed up into the tree to re-set the gin.\n\nHe took the hawk from the trap (his feathers were all draggled and wet\nfrom the rain), and threw the dead bird down; and, whether it was that\nthe act of throwing it caused an extra strain upon the bough, or whether\nthe storm had cracked it in the night, or whether it had rotted away\nmore than appeared on the surface, or whether it was all of these things\ntogether, certain it is the bough broke, and down came the keeper thud\non the sward. The bough fell down with him, and as it fell it struck\nthe gun, and the gun exploded, and although the dogs scampered aside\nwhen they heard the crack, they did not scamper so quick but one of them\nwas shot dead, and the other two were mortally wounded.\n\nFor a while the keeper lay there stunned, with the wet grass against his\nface. But by-and-by, coming to himself, he sat up with difficulty, and\ncalled for assistance, for he could not move, having sprained one ankle,\nand broken the small bone of the other leg. There he sat and shouted,\nbut no one came for some time, till presently a slouching labourer (it\nwas the very same who put up the wire by the copse in which the hare was\ncaught) chanced to pass by outside the wood. The keeper saw him, but\nhoarse with shouting, and feeling faint too (for a sprained ankle is\nextremely painful), he could not make him hear. But he bethought him of\nhis gun, and dragging it to him, hastily put in a cartridge and fired.\n\nThe report drew the labourer's attention, and peering into the wood, he\nsaw some one on the ground waving a white handkerchief. After looking a\nlong time, he made up his mind to go and see what it was; but then he\nrecollected that if he put his foot inside the wood he should be\ntrespassing, and as he had got a wire in his pocket that would be a\nserious matter. So he altered his mind, and went on.\n\nVery likely the keeper was angry, but there was no one to hear what he\nsaid except the dead hawk. He would have fired off fifty cartridges if\nhe had had them, but as he did not like a weight to carry he had only\ntwo or three, and these did not attract attention. As for the labourer,\nabout midday, when he sat down to lunch in the cart-house at the farm\nwhere he worked with the other men, he did just mention that he thought\nhe had seen something white waving in the wood, and they said it was\nodd, but very likely nothing to speak of.\n\nOne of the wounded dogs ran home, bleeding all the way, and there crept\ninto his kennel and died; the other could not get so far, but dropped in\na hedge. The keeper's wife wondered why he did not come home to dinner,\nbut supposed, with a sigh, that he had looked in at an alehouse, and\nwent on with her work.\n\nThe keeper shouted again when his throat got less hoarse, but all the\nanswer he obtained was the echo from the wood. He tried to crawl, but\nthe pain was so exquisite he got but a very little way, and there he had\nto lie. The sun rose higher and shone out as the clouds rolled away, and\nthe rain-drops on the grass glistened bright till presently they dried\nup.\n\nWith the gleaming of the sun there was motion in the woods: blackbirds\ncame forth and crossed the glades; thrushes flew past; a jay fluttered\nround the tops of the firs; after a while a pheasant came along the\nverge of the underwood, now stepping out into the grass, and now back\nagain into the bushes. There was a pleasant cawing of rooks, and several\nsmall parties of wood-pigeons (doubtless from Choo Hoo's camp) went\nover. Two or three rabbits hopped out and fed; humble-bees went buzzing\nby; a green woodpecker flashed across the glade and disappeared among\nthe trees as if an arrow had been shot into the woods.\n\nThe slow hours went on, and as the sun grew hotter the keeper, unable to\nmove, began to suffer from the fierceness of the rays, for anything\nstill finds out the heat more than that which is in movement. First he\nlifted his hat from time to time above his head, but it was not much\nrelief, as the wind had fallen. Next he tried placing his handkerchief\ninside his hat. At last he took off his coat, stuck the barrels of his\ngun into the ground (soft from the rain), and hung the coat upon it.\nThis gave him a little shadow. The dead oak-tree having no leaves cast\nbut a narrow shade, and that fell on the opposite side to where he was.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the heat was very great and all the other birds\nappeared to have gone, a crow came (one of Kauc's retainers) and perched\nlow down on an ash-tree not more than fifty yards away. Perhaps it was\nthe dead dog; perhaps it was the knowledge that the man was helpless,\nthat brought him. There he perched, and the keeper reviled him, wishing\nthat he had but saved one of his cartridges, and forgetting that even\nthen the barrels of his gun were too full of earth. After a while the\ncrow flew idly across to the other side of the glade, and went out of\nsight; but it was only for a short time, and presently he came back\nagain. This the crow did several times, always returning to the ash.\n\nThe keeper ran over in his mind the people who would probably miss him,\nand cause a search to be made. First there was his wife; but once, when\nhe had been a long time from home, and she in a great alarm had sought\nfor him, she found him drunk at the alehouse, and he beat her for her\ntrouble. It was not likely that she would come. The lad who acted as his\nassistant (he had but one, for, as previously stated, the former owner\ndid not shoot) was not likely to look for him either, for not long\nsince, bringing a message to his superior, he discovered him selling\nsome game, and was knocked down for his pains. As for his companions at\nthe alehouse, they would be all out in the fields, and would not\nassemble till night: several of them he knew were poachers, and though\nglad enough to share his beer would not have looked towards him if in\ndistress.\n\nThe slow hours wore on, and the sun declining a little, the shadow of\nthe dead oak moved round, and together with his coat sheltered him\nfairly well. Weary with the unwonted labour of thinking, the tension of\nhis mind began to yield, and by-and-by he dropped asleep, lying at full\nlength upon his back. The crow returned once more to the ash, and looked\nat the sleeping man and the dead dog, cleaned his beak against the\nbough, and uttered a low croak. Once he flew a little way out towards\nthem, but there was the gun: it was true he knew very well there was no\npowder (for, in the first place, he could not smell any, and, secondly,\nif there had been any he knew he should have had the shot singing about\nhis ears long before this; you see, he could put two and two together),\nstill there was the gun. The dog does not like the corner where the\nwalking-stick stands. The crow did not like the gun, though it was stuck\nin the ground: he went back to the ash, cleaned his bill, and waited.\n\nSomething came stealthily through the grass, now stopping, now advancing\nwith a creeping, evil motion. It was the weasel. When he stole away from\nthe wood-pile, after escaping from the trap, he made up the field\ntowards the copse, but upon reflection he determined to abandon his lair\nin the hollow elm, for he had so abused Bevis's good-nature that he\ndoubted whether Bevis might not attack him even there despite the\nsquirrel. He did not know exactly where to go, knowing that every\ncreature was in secret his enemy, and in his wounded state, unable to\nmove quickly or properly defend himself, he dreaded to trust himself\nnear them. After a while he remembered the old dead oak, which was also\nhollow within, and which was so far from the copse it was not probable\nBevis would find it.\n\nThither he bent his painful steps, for his broken rib hurt him very\nmuch, and after many pauses to rest, presently, in the afternoon, he\ncame near. Lifting his head above the grass he saw the dead dog, and the\nsleeping keeper; he watched them a long time, and seeing that neither of\nthem moved he advanced closer. As he approached he saw the dead hawk,\nand recognised one of Ki Ki's retainers; then coming to the dog, the\nblood from the shot wounds excited his terrible thirst. But it had\nceased to flow; he sniffed at it and then went towards the man.\n\nThe crow, envious, but afraid to join the venture, watched him from the\nash. Every few inches the weasel stayed, lifted his head; looked, and\nlistened. Then he advanced again, paused, and again approached. In five\nminutes he had reached the keeper's feet; two minutes more and he was by\nhis waist. He listened again; he sniffed, he knew it was dangerous, but\nhe could not check the resistless prompting of his appetite.\n\nHe crept up on the keeper's chest; the crow fidgeted on the ash. He\ncrept up to the necktie; the crow came down on a lower bough. He moved\nyet another inch to the collar; the crow flew out ten yards and settled\non the ground. The collar was stiff, and partly covered that part of the\nneck which fascinated the weasel's gaze. He put his foot softly on the\ncollar; the crow hopped thrice towards them. He brought up his other\nfoot, he sniffed--the breath came warm from the man's half-open lips--he\nadventured the risk, and placed his paw on the keeper's neck.\n\nInstantly--as if he had received an electric shock--the keeper started\nto his knees, shuddering; the weasel dropped from his neck upon the\nground, the crow hastened back to the ash. With a blow of his open hand\nthe keeper knocked the weasel yards away; then, in his rage and fear,\nwith whitened face, he wished instead he had beaten the creature down\nupon the earth, for the weasel, despite the grinding of his broken rib,\nbegan to crawl off, and he could not reach him.\n\nHe looked round for a stick or stone, there was none; he put his hand in\nhis pocket, but his knife had slipped out when he fell from the tree. He\npassed his hands over his waistcoat seeking for something, felt his\nwatch--a heavy silver one--and in his fury snatched it from the swivel,\nand hurled it at the weasel. The watch thrown with such force missed the\nweasel, struck the sward, and bounded up against the oak: the glass\nshivered and flew sparkling a second in the sunshine; the watch glanced\naside, and dropped in the grass. When he looked again the weasel had\ngone. It was an hour before the keeper recovered himself--the shuddering\nterror with which he woke up haunted him in the broad daylight.\n\nAn intolerable thirst now tormented him, but the furrow was dry. In the\nmorning, he remembered it had contained a little water from the rain,\nwhich during the day had sunk into the earth. He picked a bennet from\nthe grass and bit it, but it was sapless, dried by the summer heat. He\nlooked for a leaf of sorrel, but there was none. The slow hours wore on;\nthe sun sank below the wood, and the long shadows stretched out.\nBy-and-by the grass became cooler to the touch; dew was forming upon it.\nOverhead the rooks streamed homewards to their roosting trees. They\ncawed incessantly as they flew; they were talking about Kapchack and\nChoo Hoo, but he did not understand them.\n\nThe shadows reached across the glade, and yonder the rabbits appeared\nagain from among the bushes where their burrows were. He began now to\nseriously think that he should have to pass the night there. His ankle\nwas swollen, and the pain almost beyond endurance. The slightest attempt\nat motion caused intense agony. His one hope now was that the same\nslouching labourer who had passed in the morning would go back that way\nat night; but as the shadows deepened that hope departed, and he doubted\ntoo whether any one could see him through the underwood in the dark. The\nslouching labourer purposely avoided that route home. He did not want to\nsee anything, if anything there was.\n\nHe went round by the high road, and having had his supper, and given his\nwife a clout in the head, he sauntered down to the alehouse. After he\nhad taken three quarts of beer, he mentioned the curious incident of the\nwhite handkerchief in the woods to his mates, who congratulated him on\nhis sense in refraining from going near it, as most likely it was one of\nthat keeper's tricks, just to get somebody into the wood. More talk, and\nmore beer. By-and-by the keeper's wife began to feel alarmed. She had\nalready found the dead dog in the kennel; but that did not surprise her\nin the least, knowing her husband's temper, and that if a dog disobeyed\nit was not at all unusual for a cartridge to go whistling after him.\n\nBut when the evening came, and the darkness fell; when she had gone down\nto the alehouse, braving his wrath, and found that he was not there,\nthe woman began to get hysterical. The lad who acted as assistant had\ngone home, so she went out into the nearest stubble herself, thinking\nthat her husband must have finished his round before lunch, and was\nsomewhere in the newly-reaped fields. But after walking about the\nrustling stubble till she was weary, she came back to the alehouse, and\nbegged the men to tell her if they had seen anything of him. Then they\ntold her about the white handkerchief which the slouching poacher had\nseen in the wood that morning. She turned on him like a tiger, and\nfiercely upbraided him; then rushed from the house. The sloucher took up\nhis quart, and said that he saw \"no call\" to hurry.\n\nBut some of the men went after the wife. The keeper was found, and\nbrought home on a cart, but not before he had seen the owl go by, and\nthe dark speck of the bat passing to and fro overhead.\n\nAll that day Bevis did not go to the copse, being much upset with the\ncheat the weasel had played him, and also because they said the grass\nand the hedges would be so wet after the storm. Nor did anything take\nplace in the copse, for King Kapchack moped in his fortress, the\norchard, the whole day long, so greatly was he depressed by the\nwidespread treason of which the owl had informed him.\n\nChoo Hoo, thinking that the treaty was concluded, relaxed the strictness\nof discipline, and permitted his army to spread abroad from the camp and\nforage for themselves. He expected the return of the ambassador with\nfurther communications, and ordered search to be made for every dainty\nfor his entertainment; while the thrush, for whom this care was taken,\nhad not only ceased to exist, but it would have been impossible to\ncollect his feathers, blown away to every quarter.\n\nThe vast horde of barbarians were the more pleased with the liberty\naccorded to them, because they had spent so ill a night while the gale\nraged through their camp. So soon as the sun began to gleam through the\nretreating clouds, they went forth in small parties, many of which the\nkeeper saw go over him while lying helpless by the dead oak-tree.\n\nKing Kapchack, after the owl had informed him of the bewildering maze of\ntreason with which he was surrounded, moped, as has been said before,\nupon his perch. In the morning, wet and draggled from the storm, his\nfeathers out of place, and without the spirit to arrange them, he seemed\nto have grown twenty years older in one night, so pitiable did he\nappear. Nor did the glowing sun, which filled all other hearts with joy,\nreach his gloomy soul. He saw no resource; no enterprise suggested\nitself to him; all was dark at noonday.\n\nAn ominous accident which had befallen the aged apple-tree in which his\npalace stood contributed to this depression of mind. The gale had\ncracked a very large bough, which, having shown signs of weakness, had\nfor many years been supported by a prop carefully put up by the farmer.\nBut whether the prop in course of time had decayed at the line where the\nair and earth exercise their corroding influence upon wood; or whether\nthe bough had stiffened with age, and could not swing easily to the\nwind; or whether, as seems most likely, the event occurred at that\njuncture in order to indicate the course of fate, it is certain that the\nhuge bough was torn partly away from the trunk, leaving a gaping cavity.\n\nKapchack viewed the injury to the tree, which had so long sustained his\nfamily and fortune, with the utmost concern; it seemed an omen of\napproaching destruction so plain and unmistakable that he could not look\nat it; he turned his mournful gaze in the opposite direction. The day\npassed slowly, as slowly as it did to the keeper lying beneath the oak,\nand the king, though he would have resented intrusion with the sharpest\nlanguage, noticed with an increasing sense of wrong that the court was\ndeserted, and with one exception none called to pay their respects.\n\nThe exception was Eric, the favourite missel-thrush, who alone of all\nthe birds was allowed to frequent the same orchard. The missel-thrush,\nloyal to the last, came, but seeing Kapchack's condition, did not\nendeavour to enter into conversation. As for the rest, they did not\nventure from fear of the king's violent temper, and because their\nunquiet consciences made them suspect that this unusual depression was\ncaused by the discovery of their treachery. They remained away from\ndread of his anger. Kapchack, on the other hand, put their absence down\nto the mean and contemptible desire to avoid a falling house. He\nobserved that even the little Te-te, the tomtit, and chief of the\nsecret police, who invariably came twice or thrice a day with an account\nof some gossip he had overheard, did not arrive. How low he must have\nfallen, since the common informers disdained to associate with him!\n\nTowards the evening he sent for his son, Prince Tchack-tchack, with the\nintention of abdicating in his favour, but what were his feelings when\nthe messenger returned without him! Tchack-tchack refused to come. He,\ntoo, had turned away. Thus, deserted by the lovely La Schach, for whom\nhe had risked his throne; deserted by the whole court and even by his\nown son; the monarch welcomed the darkness of the night, the second of\nhis misery, which hid his disgrace from the world.\n\nThe owl came, faithful by night as the missel-thrush by day, but\nKapchack, in the deepest despondency, could not reply to his remarks.\nTwice the owl came back, hoping to find his master somewhat more open to\nconsolation, and twice had to depart unsuccessful. At last, about\nmidnight, the king, worn out with grief, fell asleep.\n\nNow the same evening the hare, who was upon the hills as usual, as she\ncame by a barn overheard some bats who lived there conversing about the\nnews which they had learnt from their relations who resided in the woods\nof the vale. This was nothing less than the revelations the dying hawk\nhad made of the treacherous designs of Ki Ki and the weasel, which, as\nthe owl had suspected, had been partly overheard by the bats. The hare,\nin other circumstances, would have rejoiced at the overthrow of King\nKapchack, who was no favourite with her race, for he had, once or twice,\nout of wanton cruelty, pecked weakly leverets to death, just to try the\ntemper of his bill. But she dreaded lest if he were thrust down the\nweasel should seize the sovereignty, the weasel, who had already done\nher so much injury, and was capable of ruining not only herself but her\nwhole nation if once he got the supreme power.\n\nNot knowing what to do herself for the best, away she went down the\nvalley and over the steep ridges in search of a very old hare, quite\nhoar with age--an astrologer of great reputation in those parts. For the\nhares have always been good star-gazers, and the whole race of them, one\nand all, are not without skill in the mystic sciences, while some are\nhighly charged with knowledge of futurity, and have decided the fate of\nmighty battles by the mere direction in which they scampered. The old\nhare no sooner heard her information than he proceeded to consult the\nstars, which shone with exceeding brilliance that night, as they often\ndo when the air has been cleared by a storm, and finding, upon taking\naccurate observations, that the house of Jupiter was threatened by the\napproach of Saturn to the meridian, he had no difficulty in pronouncing\nthe present time as full of danger and big with fate.\n\nThe planets were clearly in combination against King Kapchack, who must,\nif he desired to avoid extinction, avoid all risks, and hide his head,\nas it were, in a corner till the aspect of the heavens changed. Above\nall things let him not make war or go forth himself into the combat; let\nhim conclude peace, or at least enter into a truce, no matter at what\nloss of dignity, or how much territory he had to concede to conciliate\nChoo Hoo. His person was threatened, the knife was pointed at his heart;\ncould he but wait a while, and tide as it were over the shallows, he\nmight yet resume the full sway of power; but if he exposed his life at\nthis crisis the whole fabric of his kingdom might crumble beneath his\nfeet.\n\nHaving thus spoken, the hoary astrologer went off in the direction of\nStonehenge, whose stones formed his astrolabe, and the hare, much\nexcited with the communication she had received (confirmed as it was too\nby the facts of the case), resolved to at once warn the monarch of his\ndanger. Calling a beetle, she charged him with a message to the king:\nThat he should listen to the voice of the stars, and conclude peace at\nno matter what cost, or at least a truce, submitting to be deprived of\nterritory or treasure to any amount or extent, and that above all things\nhe should not venture forth personally to the combat. If he hearkened he\nwould yet reign; if he closed his ears the evil influence which then\nthreatened him must have its way. Strictly enjoining the beetle to make\nhaste, and turn neither to the right nor the left, but to speed straight\naway for the palace, she dismissed him.\n\nThe beetle, much pleased to be employed upon so important a business,\nopened his wing-cases, began to hum, and increasing his pace as he went,\nflew off at his utmost velocity. He passed safely over the hills,\ndescended into the valley, sped across the fields and woods, and in an\nincredibly short space of time approached the goal of his journey. The\nwall of the orchard was in sight, he began to repeat his message to\nhimself, so as to be sure and not miss a word of it, when going at this\ntremendous pace, and as usual, without looking in front, but blundering\nonwards, he flew with his whole force against a post. His body, crushed\nby the impetus of its own weight, rebounded with a snap, and he fell\ndisabled and insensible to the earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE COURTSHIP IN THE ORCHARD.\n\n\nThe next morning Bevis's papa looking at the almanac found there was\ngoing to be an eclipse of the sun, so Bevis took a piece of glass (part\nof one of the many window panes he had broken) and smoked it over a\ncandle, so as to be able to watch the phenomenon without injury to his\neyes. When the obscuration began too, the dairy-maid brought him a\nbucket of clear water in which the sun was reflected and could be\ndistinctly seen. But before the eclipse had proceeded beyond the mere\nedge of the sun, Bevis heard the champing of a bit, and the impatient\npawing of hoofs, and running up to the stable to see who it was, found\nthat his papa was just on the point of driving over in the dog-cart to\nsee another farmer (the very old gentleman in whose orchard Kapchack's\npalace was situated) about a load of straw.\n\nBevis of course insisted upon going too, the smoked glass was thrown\naside, he clambered up and held the reins, and away they went, the\neclipse now counting for nothing. After a while, however, as they went\nswiftly along the road, they came to a hill, and from the summit saw a\nlong way off a vast shadow like that cast by some immense cloud which\ncame towards them over the earth, and in a second or two arrived, and\nas it were put out the light. They looked up and the sun was almost\ngone. In its place was a dark body, with a rim of light round it, and\nflames shooting forth.\n\nAs they came slowly down the hill a pheasant crowed as he flew up to\nroost, the little birds retired to the thickets, and at the farmyards\nthey passed the fowls went up to their perches. Presently they left the\nhighway and drove along a lane across the fields, which had once been\ndivided from each other by gates. Of these there was nothing now\nstanding but the posts, some of which could hardly be said to stand, but\ndeclining from the perpendicular, were only kept from falling by the\nbushes. The lane was so rough and so bad from want of mending that they\ncould only walk the impatient horse, and at times the jolting was\nextremely unpleasant.\n\nSometimes they had to stoop down in the trap to pass under the drooping\nboughs of elms and other trees, which not having been cut for years,\nhung over and almost blocked the track. From the hedges the brambles and\nbriars extended out into the road, so that the wheels of the dog-cart\nbrushed them, and they would evidently have entirely shut up the way had\nnot waggons occasionally gone through and crushed their runners. The\nmeadows on either hand were brown with grass that had not been mown,\nthough the time for mowing had long since gone by, while the pastures\nwere thick with rushes and thistles. Though so extensive there were\nonly two or three cows in them, and these old and poor, and as it were\nbroken-down. No horses were visible, nor any men at work.\n\nThere were other fields which had once grown wheat, but were now so\nchoked with weeds as to be nothing but a wilderness. As they approached\nthe farmhouse where the old gentleman dwelt, the signs of desolation\nbecame more numerous. There were walls that had fallen, and never been\nrepaired, around whose ruins the nettles flourished. There were holes in\nthe roofs of the sheds exposing the rafters.\n\nTrees had fallen and lay as they fell, rotting away, and not even cut up\nfor firewood. Railings had decayed till there was nothing left but a few\nstumps; gates had dropped from their hinges, and nothing of them\nremained but small bits of rotten board attached to rusty irons. In the\ngarden all was confusion, the thistles rose higher than the gooseberry\nbushes, and burdocks looked in at the windows. From the wall of the\nhouse a pear that had been trained there had fallen away, and hung\nsuspended, swinging with every puff; the boughs, driven against the\nwindows, had broken the panes in the adjacent casement; other panes\nwhich had been broken were stuffed up with wisps of hay.\n\nTiles had slipped from the roof, and the birds went in and out as they\nlisted. The remnants of the tiles lay cracked upon the ground beneath\nthe eaves just as they had fallen. No hand had touched them; the hand of\nman indeed had touched nothing. Bevis, whose eyes were everywhere, saw\nall these things in a minute. \"Why,\" said he, \"there's the knocker; it\nhas tumbled down.\" It had dropped from the door as the screws rusted;\nthe door itself was propped up with a log of wood. But one thing only\nappeared to have been attended to, and that was the wall about the\norchard, which showed traces of recent mortar, and the road leading\ntowards it, which had not long since been mended with flints.\n\nNow Bevis, as I say, noting all these things as they came near with his\neyes, which, like gimlets, went through everything, was continually\nasking his papa questions about them, and why everything was in such a\nstate, till at last his papa, overwhelmed with his inquiries, promised\nto tell him the whole story when they got home. This he did, but while\nthey are now fastening up the horse (for there was no one to help them\nor mind it), and while Bevis is picking up the rusty knocker, the story\nmay come in here very well:--\n\nOnce upon a time, many, many years ago, when the old gentleman was\nyoung, and lived with his mother at the farmhouse, it happened that he\nfell in love. The lady he loved was very young, very beautiful, very\nproud, very capricious, and very poor. She lived in a house in the\nvillage little better than a cottage, with an old woman who was said to\nbe her aunt. As the young farmer was well off, for the land was his own,\nand he had no one to keep but his old mother, and as the young lady\ndearly loved him, there seemed no possible obstacle in their way. But it\nis well known that a brook can never run straight, and thus, though all\nlooked so smooth, there were, in reality, two difficulties.\n\nThe first of these was the farmer's old mother, who having been mistress\nin the farmhouse for very nearly fifty years, did not like, after\nhalf-a-century, to give place to a mere girl. She could not refrain from\nuttering disparaging remarks about her, to which her son, being fond of\nhis mother, could not reply, though it angered him to the heart, and at\nsuch times he used to take down his long single-barrelled gun with brass\nfittings, and go out shooting. More than once the jealous mother had\ninsulted the young lady openly in the village street, which conduct, of\ncourse, as things fly from roof to roof with the sparrows, was known all\nover the place, and caused the lady to toss her head like a filly in\nspring to show that she did not care for such an old harridan, though in\nsecret it hurt her pride beyond expression.\n\nSo great was the difficulty this caused, that the young lady,\nnotwithstanding she was so fond of the handsome young farmer, who rode\nso well and shot so straight, and could carry her in his arms as if she\nwere no more than a lamb, would never put her dainty foot, which looked\nso little and pretty even in the rude shoes made for her by the village\ncobbler, over the threshold of his house. She would never come in, she\nsaid, except as a wife, while he on his part, anxious as he was to marry\nher, could not, from affection for his mother, summon up courage to\nbring her in, as it were, rough-shod over his mother's feelings.\n\nTheir meetings, therefore, as she would not come indoors, were always\nheld in the farmer's orchard, where was a seat in an arbour, a few yards\nin front of which stood the ancient apple-tree in which Kapchack, who\nwas also very young in those days, had built his nest. At this arbour\nthey met every day, and often twice a day, and even once again in the\nevening, and could there chat and make love as sweetly as they pleased,\nbecause the orchard was enclosed by a high wall which quite shut out all\nspying eyes, and had a gate with lock and key. The young lady had a\nduplicate key, and came straight to the orchard from the cottage where\nshe lived by a footpath which crossed the lane along which Bevis had\nbeen driven.\n\nIt happened that the footpath just by the lane, on coming near the\norchard, passed a moist place, which in rainy weather was liable to be\nflooded, and as this was inconvenient for her, her lover had a\nwaggon-load of flints brought down from the hills where the hares held\ntheir revels, and placed in the hollow so as to fill it up, and over\nthese he placed faggots of nut-tree wood, so that she could step across\nperfectly clean and dry. In this orchard, then, they had their constant\nrendezvous; they were there every day when the nightingale first began\nto sing in the spring, and when the apple-trees were hidden with their\npink blossom, when the haymakers were at work in the meadow, when the\nreapers cut the corn, and when the call of the first fieldfare sounded\noverhead. The golden and rosy apples dropped at their feet, they laughed\nand ate them, and taking out the brown pips she pressed them between\nher thumb and finger to see how far they would shoot.\n\nThough they had begun to talk about their affairs in the spring, and had\nkept on all the summer and autumn, and though they kept on as often as\nthe weather was dry (when they walked up and down the long orchard for\nwarmth, sheltered by the wall), yet when the spring came again they had\nnot half finished. Thus they were very happy, and the lady used\nparticularly to laugh at the antics of the magpie, who became so\naccustomed to their presence as to go on with the repairs to his nest\nwithout the least shyness. Kapchack, being then very young and full of\nspirits, and only just married, and in the honeymoon of prosperity,\nplayed such freaks and behaved in so amusing a manner that the lady\nbecame quite attached to him, and in order to protect her favourite, her\nlover drove away all the other large birds that came near the orchard,\nand would not permit any one whatever to get up into Kapchack's\napple-tree, nor even to gather the fruit, which hung on the boughs till\nthe wind pushed it off.\n\nThus, having a fortress to retreat to, and being so highly honoured of\nmen, Kapchack gave the reins to his natural audacity, and succeeded in\nobtaining the sovereignty. When the spring came again they had still a\ngreat deal of talking to do; but whether the young lady was weary of\nwaiting for the marriage-ring, or whether she was jealous of the\nfarmer's mother, or whether she thought they might continue like this\nfor the next ten years if she did not make some effort, or whether it\nwas the worldly counsels of her aunt, or what it was--perhaps her own\ncapricious nature, it is certain that they now began to quarrel a little\nabout another gentleman.\n\nThis gentleman was very rich, and the owner of a large estate in the\nneighbourhood; he did not often reside there, for he did not care for\nsport or country life, but once when he came down he happened to see the\nyoung lady, and was much attracted towards her. Doubtless she did not\nmean any harm, but she could not help liking people to admire her, and,\nnot to go into every little particular, in the course of time (and not\nvery long either) she and the gentleman became acquainted. Now, when her\nown true lover was aware of this, he was so jealous that he swore if\never he saw them together he would shoot his rival with his\nlong-barrelled gun, though he were hung for it the next day.\n\nThe lady was not a little pleased at this frantic passion, and secretly\nliked him ten times better for it, though she immediately resorted to\nevery artifice to calm his anger, for she knew his violent nature, and\nthat he was quite capable of doing as he had said. But the delight of\ntwo strings to her bow was not easily to be foregone, and thus, though\nshe really loved the farmer, she did not discourage the gentleman. He,\non his part, finding after a while that although she allowed him to talk\nto her, and even to visit her at the cottage, and sometimes (when she\nknew the young farmer was at market) go for a walk with him, and once\neven came and went over his grand mansion, still finding that it was\nall talk, and that his suit got no further, he presently bethought him\nof diamonds.\n\nHe gave her a most beautiful diamond locket, which he had had down all\nfresh and brilliant from London. Now this was the beginning of the\nmischief. She accepted it in a moment of folly, and wished afterwards\nten times that she had refused, but having once put it on, it looked so\nlovely she could not send it back. She could not openly wear it, lest\nher lover should see it, but every morning she put it on indoors, and\nfrequently glanced in the glass.\n\nNor is it any use to find fault with her; for in the first place she has\nbeen dead many years, and in the second she was then very young, very\nbeautiful, and living quite alone in the world with an old woman. Now\nher lover, notwithstanding the sweet assurances she gave him of her\nfaithfulness, and despite the soft kisses he had in abundance every day\nin the orchard, soft as the bloom of the apple-trees, could not quite\nrecover his peace of mind. He did not laugh as he used to do. He was\nrestless, and the oneness of his mind was gone. Oneness of mind does not\noften last long into life, but while it lasts everything is bright. He\nhad now always a second thought, a doubt behind, which clouded his face\nand brought a line into his forehead.\n\nAfter a time his mother, observing his depression, began to accuse\nherself of unkindness, and at last resolved to stand no longer in the\nway of the marriage. She determined to quit the house in which she had\nlived ever since she came to it a happy bride half-a-century before.\nHaving made up her mind, that very morning she walked along the footpath\nto the young lady's cottage, intending to atone for her former\nunkindness, and to bring the girl back to lunch, and thus surprise her\nson when he came in from the field.\n\nShe had even made up her mind to put up with the cold reception she\nwould probably meet with, nor to reply if any hard words were used\ntowards her. Thus thinking, she lifted the latch, as country people do\nnot use much ceremony, and stepped into the cottage, when what was her\nsurprise to find the girl she had come to see with a beautiful diamond\nlocket about her neck, gleaming in the sunshine from the open door! She\ninstantly understood what it meant, and upbraiding the girl with her\nfalseness, quitted the place, and lost no time in telling her son, but\nfirst she took the precaution of hiding his gun. As he could not find\nthat weapon, after the first storm of his jealous anger had gone over he\nshut himself up in his room.\n\nThe lady came the same evening to the rendezvous in the orchard, but her\nlover did not meet her. She came again next day, and in the evening; and\nagain the third day, and so all through the week, and for nearly a month\ndoing all she could without actually entering the house to get access to\nhim. But he sullenly avoided her; once seeing her in the road, he leaped\nhis horse over the hedge rather than pass her. For the diamond locket\nlooked so like a price--as if she valued a glittering bauble far above\ntrue love.\n\nAt last one day she surprised him at the corner of the village street,\nand notwithstanding that the people (who knew all the story) were\nlooking on, she would speak to him. She walked by his side, and said:\n\"George, I have put the locket in the arbour, with a letter for you. If\nyou will not speak to me, read the letter, and throw the locket in the\nbrook.\"\n\nMore she could not say, for he walked as fast as he could, and soon left\nher behind.\n\nHe would not go near the orchard all day, but at last in the evening\nsomething prompted him to go. He went and looked, but the locket and the\nletter were not there.\n\nEither she had not left them as she had said, or else some one had taken\nthem. No one could enter the orchard without a key, unless they went to\nthe trouble of bringing a ladder from the rickyard, and as it was\nspring, there were no apples to tempt them to do that. He thought,\nperhaps, his mother might have taken his key and gone to the arbour, and\nthere was a terrible scene and bitter words between them--the first time\nhe had ever replied to her. The consequence was that she packed a chest\nthat very day, took a bag of money, which in old-fashioned style she\nkept under her bed, and left her home for ever; but not before she had\nbeen to the cottage, and reviled the girl with her duplicity and her\nfalseness, declaring that if she had not got the locket, she had not put\nit in the orchard, but had sold it, like the hussy she was! Fortunately,\nhowever, she added, George could now see through her.\n\nThe farmer himself, much agitated at his mother's departure, made\nanother search for the locket, and mowed the grass in the orchard\nhimself, thinking that perhaps the lady had dropped it, or that it had\ncaught in her dress and dragged along, and he also took the rake, and\nturned over every heap of dead leaves which the wind had blown into the\ncorners. But there was no locket and no letter. At last he thought that\nperhaps the magpie, Kapchack--as magpies were always famous for their\nfondness for glittering things, such as silver spoons--might have picked\nup the locket, attracted by the gleaming diamonds. He got a ladder and\nsearched the nest, even pulling part of it to pieces, despite Kapchack's\nangry remonstrances, but the locket was not there.\n\nAs he came down the ladder there was the young lady, who had stolen into\nthe orchard and watched his operations. They stood and faced each other\nfor a minute: at least, she looked at him, _his_ sullen gaze was bent\nupon the ground. As for her, the colour came and went in her cheek, and\nher breast heaved so that, for a while, she could not speak. At last she\nsaid very low: \"So you do not believe me, but some day you will know\nthat you have judged me wrongly\". Then she turned, and without another\nword went swiftly from the orchard.\n\nHe did not follow her, and he never saw her again. The same evening she\nleft the village, she and the old woman, her aunt, quietly and without\nany stir, and where they went (beyond the market town) no one knew or\neven heard. And the very same evening, too, the rich gentleman who had\ngiven her the locket, and who made an unwonted stay in his country home\nbecause of her, also left the place, and went, as was said, to London.\nOf course people easily put two and two together, and said no doubt the\ngirl had arranged to meet her wealthy admirer, but no one ever saw them\ntogether. Not even the coachman, when the gentleman once more returned\nhome years afterwards, though the great authority in those days, could\nsay what had become of her; if she had met his master it was indeed in\nsome secret and mysterious manner. But the folk, when he had done\nspeaking, and had denied these things, after he had quaffed his ale and\ndeparted, nudged each other, and said that no doubt his master,\nforeseeing the inquiries that would be made, had bribed him with a\npocketful of guineas to hold his tongue.\n\nSo the farmer, in one day, found himself alone; his dear lady, his\nmother, and his rival were gone. He alone remained, and alone he\nremained for the rest of his days. His rival, indeed, came back once now\nand then for short periods to his mansion; but his mother never\nreturned, and died in a few years' time. Then indeed deserted, the\nfarmer had nothing left but to cultivate, and dwell on, the memory of\nthe past. He neglected his business, and his farm; he left his house to\ntake care of itself; the cows wandered away, the horses leaped the\nhedges, other people's cattle entered his corn, trampled his wheat, and\nfattened on his clover. He did nothing. The hand of man was removed, and\nthe fields, and the house, and the owner himself, fell to decay.\n\nYears passed, and still it was the same, and thus it was, that when\nBevis and his papa drove up, Bevis was so interested and so inquisitive\nabout the knocker, which had fallen from the front door. One thing, and\none place only, received the owner's care, and that was the orchard, the\narbour, the magpie's nest, and the footpath that led to the orchard\ngate. Everything else fell to ruin, but these were very nearly in the\nsame state as when the young lady used to come to the orchard daily. For\nthe old gentleman, as he grew old, and continued to dwell yet more and\nmore upon the happy days so long gone by, could not believe that she\ncould be dead, though he himself had outlived the usual span of life.\n\nHe was quite certain that she would some day come back, for she had said\nso herself; she had said that some day he would know that he had judged\nher wrongly, and unless she came back it was not possible for him to\nunderstand. He was, therefore, positively certain that some day she\nwould come along the old footpath to the gate in the orchard wall, open\nit with her duplicate key, walk to the arbour and sit down, and smile at\nthe magpie's ways. The woodwork of the arbour had of course decayed long\nsince, but it had been carefully replaced, so that it appeared exactly\nthe same as when she last sat within it. The coping fell from the\norchard wall, but it was put back; the gate came to pieces, but a new\none was hung in its place.\n\nKapchack, thus protected, still came to his palace, which had reached an\nenormous size from successive additions and annual repairs. As the time\nwent on people began to talk about Kapchack, and the extraordinary age\nto which he had now attained, till, by-and-by, he became the wonder of\nthe place, and in order to see how long he would live, the gentlemen who\nhad gamekeepers in the neighbourhood instructed them to be careful not\nto shoot him. His reputation extended with his years, and those curious\nin such things came to see him from a distance, but could never obtain\nentrance to the orchard, nor approach near his tree, for neither money\nnor persuasion could induce the owner to admit them.\n\nIn and about the village itself Kapchack was viewed by the superstitious\nwith something like awe. His great age, his singular fortune, his\npeculiar appearance--having but one eye--gave him a wonderful prestige,\nand his chattering was firmly believed to portend a change of the\nweather or the wind, or even the dissolution of village personages. The\nknowledge that he was looked upon in this light rendered the other birds\nand animals still more obedient than they would have been. Kapchack was\na marvel, and it gradually became a belief with them that he would never\ndie.\n\nOutside the orchard-gate, the footpath which crossed the lane, and\nalong which the lady used to come, was also carefully kept in its former\ncondition. By degrees the nut-tree faggots rotted away--they were\nsupplanted by others; in the process of time the flints sunk into the\nearth, and then another waggon-load was sent for. But the waggons had\nall dropped to pieces except one which chanced to be under cover; this,\ntoo, was much decayed, still it held together enough for the purpose. It\nwas while this very waggon was jolting down from the hills with a load\nof flints to fill this hollow that the one particular flint, out of five\nthousand, worked its way through a hole in the bottom and fell on the\nroad. And the rich old gentleman, whose horse stepped on it the same\nevening, who was thrown from the dog-cart, and whose discharged groom\nshot him in his house in London, was the very same man who, years and\nyears before, had given the diamond locket to the young lady.\n\nIn the orchard the old farmer pottered about every day, now picking up\nthe dead wood which fell from the trees, now raking up the leaves, and\ngathering the fruit (except that on Kapchack's tree), now mowing the\ngrass, according to the season, now weeding the long gravel path at the\nside under the sheltering wall, up and down which the happy pair had\nwalked in the winters so long ago. The butterflies flew over, the\nswallows alighted on the topmost twigs of the tall pear-tree and\ntwittered sweetly, the spiders spun their webs, or came floating down on\ngossamer year after year, but he did not notice that they were not the\nsame butterflies or the same swallows which had been there in his\nyouth. Everything was the same to him within the orchard, however much\nthe world might change without its walls.\n\nWhy, the very houses in the village close by had many of them fallen and\nbeen rebuilt; there was scarcely a resident left who dwelt there then;\neven the ancient and unchangeable church was not the same--it had been\nrenovated; why, even the everlasting hills were different, for the\nslopes were now in many places ploughed, and grew oats where nothing but\nsheep had fed. But all within the orchard was the same; his lady, too,\nwas the same without doubt, and her light step would sooner or later\ncome down the footpath to her lover. This was the story Bevis's papa\ntold him afterwards.\n\nThey had some difficulty in fastening up the horse, until they pulled\nsome hay from a hayrick, and spread it before him, for like Bevis he had\nto be bribed with cake, as it were, before he would be good. They then\nknocked at the front door, which was propped up with a beam of timber,\nbut no one answered, nor did even a dog bark at the noise; indeed, the\ndog's kennel had entirely disappeared, and only a piece of the staple to\nwhich his chain had been fastened remained, a mere rusty stump in the\nwall. It was not possible to look into this room, because the broken\nwindows were blocked with old sacks to keep out the draught and rain;\nbut the window of the parlour was open, the panes all broken, and the\ncasement loose, so that it must have swung and banged with the wind.\n\nWithin, the ceiling had fallen upon the table, and the chairs had\nmouldered away; the looking-glass on the mantelpiece was hidden with\ncobwebs, the cobwebs themselves disused; for as they collected the dust,\nthe spiders at last left them to spin new ones elsewhere. The carpet, if\nit remained, was concealed by the dead leaves which had been carried in\nby the gales. On these lay one or two picture frames, the back part\nupwards, the cords had rotted from the nails, and as they dropped so\nthey stayed. In a punch-bowl of ancient ware, which stood upon the old\npiano untouched all these years, a robin had had his nest. After Bevis\nhad been lifted up to the window-ledge to look in at this desolation,\nthey went on down towards the orchard, as if the old gentleman was not\nwithin he was certain to be there.\n\nThey found the gate of the orchard open--rather an unusual thing, as he\ngenerally kept it locked, even when at work inside--and as they stepped\nin, they saw a modern double-barrel gun leant against a tree. A little\nfarther, and Bevis caught sight of Kapchack's nest, like a wooden castle\nin the boughs, and clapped his hands with delight. But there was a\nladder against Kapchack's tree, a thing which had not been seen there\nthese years and years, and underneath the tree was the old farmer\nhimself, pale as his own white beard, and only kept from falling to the\nground by the strong arms of a young gentleman who upheld him. They\nimmediately ran forward to see what was the matter.\n\nNow it had happened in this way. It will be recollected that when the\nkeeper fell from the dead oak-tree, he not only disabled himself, but\nhis gun going off shot the dogs. Thus when the heir to the estate came\ndown the same evening, he found that there was neither dog nor keeper to\ngo round with him the next day. But when the morning came, not to be\ndeprived of his sport, he took his gun and went forth alone into the\nfields. He did not find much game, but he shot two or three partridges\nand a rabbit, and he was so tempted by the crowds of wood-pigeons that\nwere about (parties from Choo Hoo's army out foraging), that he fired\naway the remaining cartridges in his pocket at them.\n\nSo he found himself early in the day without a cartridge, and was just\nthinking of walking back to the house for some more, when the shadow of\nthe eclipse came over. He stayed leaning against a gate to watch the\nsun, and presently as he was looking up at it a hare ran between his\nlegs--so near, that had he seen her coming he could have caught her with\nhis hands.\n\nShe only went a short way down the hedge, and he ran there, when she\njumped out of the ditch, slipped by him, and went out fifty or sixty\nyards into the field, and sat up. How he now wished that he had not shot\naway all his ammunition at the wood-pigeons! While he looked at the hare\nshe went on, crossed the field, and entered the hedge on the other side;\nhe marked the spot, and hastened to get over the gate, with the\nintention of running home for cartridges. Hardly had he got over, than\nthe hare came back again on that side of the hedge, passed close to\nhim, and again leaped into the ditch. He turned to go after her, when\nout she came again, and crouched in a furrow only some twenty yards\ndistant.\n\nPuzzled at this singular behaviour (for he had never seen a hare act\nlike it before), he ran after her; and the curious part of it was, that\nalthough she did indeed run away, she did not go far--she kept only a\nfew yards in front, just evading him. If she went into a hedge for\nshelter, she quickly came out again, and thus this singular chase\ncontinued for some time. He got quite hot running, for though he had not\nmuch hope of catching the creature, still he wanted to understand the\ncause of this conduct.\n\nBy-and-by the zig-zag and uncertain line they took led them close to the\nwall of the old gentleman's orchard, when suddenly a fox started out\nfrom the hedge, and rushed after the hare. The hare, alarmed to the last\ndegree, darted into a large drain which went under the orchard, and the\nfox went in after her. The young gentleman ran to the spot, but could\nnot of course see far up the drain. Much excited, he ran round the\norchard wall till he came to the gate, which chanced to be open, because\nthe farmer that day, having discovered that the great bough of\nKapchack's tree had been almost torn from the trunk by the gale, had\njust carried a fresh piece of timber in for a new prop, and having his\nhands full, what with the prop and the ladder to fix it, he could not\nshut the gate behind him. So the sportsman entered the orchard, left\nhis gun leaning against a tree, and running down to see if he could find\nwhich way the drain went, came upon the old gentleman, and caught sight\nof the extraordinary nest of old King Kapchack.\n\nNow the reason Ulu (for it was the very hare Bevis was so fond of)\nplayed these fantastic freaks, and ran almost into the very hands of the\nsportsman, was because the cunning fox had driven her to do so for his\nown purposes.\n\nAfter he learnt the mysterious underground saying from the toad\nimprisoned in the elm, he kept on thinking, and thinking, what it could\nmean; but he could not make it out. He was the only fox who had a\ngrandfather living, and he applied to his grandfather, who after\npondering on the matter all day, advised him to keep his eyes open. The\nfox turned up his nostrils at this advice, which seemed to him quite\nsuperfluous. However, next day, instead of going to sleep as usual, he\ndid keep his eyes open, and by-and-by saw a notch on the edge of the\nsun, which notch grew bigger, until the shadow of the eclipse came over\nthe ground.\n\nAt this he leaped up, recognising in a moment the dead day of the\nunderground saying. He knew where Bevis's hare had her form, and\nimmediately he raced across to her, though not clearly knowing what he\nwas going to do; but as he crossed the fields he saw the sportsman,\nwithout any dogs and with an empty gun, leaning over the gate and gazing\nat the eclipse. With a snarl the fox drove Ulu from her form, and so\nworried her that she was obliged to run (to escape his teeth) right\nunder the sportsman's legs, and thus to fulfil the saying: \"The hare\nhunted the hunter\".\n\nEven yet the fox did not know what was going to happen, or why he was\ndoing this, for such is commonly the case during the progress of great\nevents. The actors do not recognise the importance of the part they are\nplaying. The age does not know what it is doing; posterity alone can\nappreciate it. But after a while, as the fox drove the hare out of the\nhedges, and met and faced her, and bewildered the poor creature, he\nobserved that her zig-zag course, entirely unpremeditated, was leading\nthem closer and closer to the orchard where Kapchack (whom he wished to\noverthrow) had his palace.\n\nThen beginning to see whither fate was carrying them, suddenly he darted\nout and drove the hare into the drain, and for safety followed her\nhimself. He knew the drain very well, and that there was an outlet on\nthe other side, having frequently visited the spot in secret in order to\nlisten to what Kapchack was talking about. Ulu, quite beside herself\nwith terror, rushed through the drain, leaving pieces of her fur against\nthe projections of the stones, and escaped into the lane on the other\nside, and so into the fields there. The fox remained in the drain to\nhear what would happen.\n\nThe sportsman ran round, entered the gate, and saw the old farmer\ntrimming the prop, the ladder just placed against the tree, and caught\nsight of the palace of King Kapchack. As he approached a missel-thrush\nflew off--it was Eric; the farmer looked up at this, and saw the\nstranger, and was at first inclined to be very angry, for he had never\nbeen intruded upon before, but as the young gentleman at once began to\napologise for the liberty, he overlooked it, and listened with interest\nto the story the sportsman told him of the vagaries of the hare. While\nthey were talking the sportsman looked up several times at the nest\nabove him, and felt an increasing curiosity to examine it. At last he\nexpressed his wish; the farmer demurred, but the young gentleman pressed\nhim so hard, and promised so faithfully not to touch anything, that at\nlast the farmer let him go up the ladder, which he had only just put\nthere, and which he had not himself as yet ascended.\n\nThe young gentleman accordingly went up the ladder, being the first who\nhad been in that tree for years, and having examined and admired the\nnest, he was just going to descend, when he stayed a moment to look at\nthe fractured bough. The great bough had not broken right off, but as\nthe prop gave way beneath it had split at the part where it joined the\ntrunk, leaving an open space, and revealing a hollow in the tree. In\nthis hollow something caught his eye; he put in his hand and drew forth\na locket, to which an old and faded letter was attached by a mouldy\nribbon twisted round it. He cast this down to the aged farmer, who\ncaught it in his hand, and instantly knew the locket which had\ndisappeared so long ago.\n\nThe gold was tarnished, but the diamonds were as bright as ever, and\nglittered in the light as the sun just then began to emerge from the\neclipse. He opened the letter, scarce knowing what he did; the ink was\nfaded and pale, but perfectly legible, for it had been in a dry place.\nThe letter said that having tried in vain to get speech with him, and\nhaving faced all the vile slander and bitter remarks of the village for\nhis sake, she had at last resolved to write and tell him that she was\nreally and truly his own. In a moment of folly she had, indeed, accepted\nthe locket, but that was all, and since the discovery she had twice sent\nit back, and it had twice been put on her dressing-table, so that she\nfound it there in the morning (doubtless by the old woman, her aunt,\nbribed for the purpose).\n\nThen she thought that perhaps it would be better to give it to him (the\nfarmer), else he might doubt that she had returned it; so she said, as\nhe would not speak to her, she should leave it in the arbour, twisting\nthe ribbon round her letter, and she begged him to throw the locket in\nthe brook, and to believe her once again, or she should be miserable for\nlife. But, if after this he still refused to speak to her, she would\nstill stay a while and endeavour to obtain access to him; and if even\nthen he remained so cruel, there was nothing left for her but to quit\nthe village, and go to some distant relations in France. She would wait,\nshe added, till the new moon shone in the sky, and then she must go, for\nshe could no longer endure the insinuations which were circulated about\nher. Lest there should be any mistake she enclosed a copy of a note she\nhad sent to the other gentleman, telling him that she should never\nspeak to him again. Finally, she put the address of the village in\nFrance to which she was going, and begged and prayed him to write to\nher.\n\nWhen the poor old man had read these words, and saw that after all the\nplayful magpie must have taken the glittering locket and placed it, not\nin his nest, but a chink of the tree; when he learned that all these\nyears and years the girl he had so dearly loved must have been waiting\nwith aching heart for a letter of forgiveness from him, the orchard swam\nround, as it were, before his eyes, he heard a rushing sound like a\nwaterfall in his ears, the returning light of the sun went out again,\nand he fainted. Had it not been for the young gentleman, who caught him,\nhe would have fallen to the ground, and it was just at this moment that\nBevis and his papa arrived at the spot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE GREAT BATTLE.\n\n\nEarly the same morning when Kapchack awoke, he was so much refreshed by\nthe sound slumber he had enjoyed, that much of his depression--the sharp\nedge of his pain as it were--had passed away. The natural vivacity of\nhis disposition asserted itself, and seemed to respond to the glory of\nthe sunshine. Hungry from his long fast, away he flew to well-known\nplaces reserved for his own especial feeding-ground, and having\nsatisfied his appetite went up into a hawthorn, trimmed his feathers,\nand began to think things over.\n\nHe at once decided that something of an exceptional character must be\nattempted in order to regain his authority. Half measures, delays, and\nintrigues were now in vain; some grand blow must be struck, such as\nwould fill all hearts with admiration or dismay. Another treaty with\nChoo Hoo was out of the question, for the overbearing rebel would throw\nin his face the assassination of the envoy, and even could it be thought\nof, who could he entrust with the mission? His throne was completely\nsurrounded with traitors. He ground his beak as he thought of them, and\nresolved that terrible indeed should be the vengeance he would take if\nonce he got them again into his power. The hope of revenge was the\nkeenest spur of all to him to adventure something bold and unexpected;\nthe hope of revenge, and the determination that the house of Kapchack\nshould not fall without an effort worthy of a monarch.\n\nHe resolved to at once attack the mighty horde Choo Hoo commanded with\nthe only troops he could get quickly together in this emergency. These\nwere the rooks, the praetorian guard of his state, the faithful,\ncourageous, and warlike tenth legion of his empire. No sooner did he\nthus finally resolve than his whole appearance seemed to change. His\noutward form in some degree reflected the spirit within. His feathers\nruffled up, and their black and white shone with new colour. The glossy\ngreen of his tail gleamed in the sunshine. One eye indeed was gone, but\nthe other sparkled with the fire of war; he scented the battle, and\nsharpened his bill against the bough.\n\nHe only regretted that he had not taken this course before, instead of\nidling in the palace, and leaving his kingdom to the wiles of traitorous\ncourtiers and delegates. If he had only bestirred himself like the\nancient Kapchack of former days this extremity would not have arisen.\nEven yet it was not too late; war was a desperate and uncertain game,\nand it was not always the greatest army, in point of numbers, that\nrejoiced in the victory. He would trust in his fortune, and swoop down\nupon the enemy. Calling to his body-guard, he flew at once straight\ntowards the plain, where, at that time in the morning, he knew the main\nbody of the rooks would be foraging. Full of these resolutions he did\nnot observe the maimed beetle lying helpless in the grass, but looking\nneither to the right nor the left, taking counsel of no one--for to whom\ncould he apply for honest advice?--he winged his way swiftly onward.\n\nIn about half-an-hour he reached the plain, and saw the rooks scattered\nover the ground; he rested here upon the lower branch of an elm, and\nsent forward a messenger, one of the eight magpies who attended him, to\ntell the commander-in-chief to wait upon him. Upon receiving the\nmessage, the general, hoping that at last the king had decided upon\naction, since so abrupt a summons to his side was somewhat unusual, flew\nhastily to the elm and saluted the monarch. Kapchack, without any\npreamble, announced his intention of forming the rooks into column, and\nfalling at once upon the horde of barbarians. In the rooks, he said, and\ntheir loyal commander, lay the last hope of the state--he placed himself\nin their midst and relied upon them solely and alone.\n\nAh Kurroo Khan, the commander-in-chief, could scarcely refrain from\nshouting with delight. He was not only wild with the joy of coming\ncombat, but this straightforward speech and conduct went to his heart,\nand never in all his long, long reign had Kapchack so complete and\nautocratic an empire as at that moment over the rooks.\n\nAh Kurroo, when he had in some degree expressed his pleasure at these\ncommands, and the readiness with which he placed himself and his army\nat Kapchack's orders, proceeded first to pass the word to the legions to\nfall into their ranks, and next to inform the monarch of the position\nheld by the enemy.\n\nThey were, he said, dispersed in all directions foraging, and discipline\nwas much relaxed, insomuch that several bands of them had even fallen to\nblows amongst themselves. To attack these scattered positions, which\ncould individually be easily overwhelmed, would be a mistake, for these\nreasons. The advantage of destroying one or two such bands of marauders\nwould be practically nothing, and while it was being accomplished the\nrest would carry the information to Choo Hoo, and he would assemble his\nenormous horde. Thus the chance of surprising and annihilating his army\nwould be lost.\n\nBut it appeared that Choo Hoo's son, Tu Kiu, who was also the second in\ncommand of the barbarians, finding that already the country was becoming\ndenuded of supplies close to the camp, had during the previous day, at\nhis father's orders, marched a large division--in itself an immense\narmy--into a plain at a few miles' distance, which was surrounded with\nthe hills, and out of sight from the camp. The best strategy therefore\nopen to Kapchack, was either to assail Choo Hoo's camp, or else to fall\nupon the divisions of Tu Kiu.\n\nThe difficulty in the case of the camp was that amidst the trees the\nassailants would suffer as much loss from crushing and confusion as\nwould be inflicted upon the enemy. It was impossible, when once\ninvolved in a forest conflict, to know which way the issue was tending.\nThe battle became split up into a thousand individual combats,\ndiscipline was of no avail, no officer could survey the scene or direct\nthe movements, and a panic at any moment was only too probable. On the\nother hand, the division of Tu Kiu offered itself for annihilation. It\nwas not only several miles distant from the main body, but a range of\nhills between prevented all view, and obstructed communication. There\nwas a route by which the plain could be approached, through a narrow\nvalley well sheltered with woods, which would screen the advancing\ntroops from sight, and enable them to debouch at once into the midst of\nthe invaders. Without doubt, thus suddenly attacked, Tu Kiu must give\nway; should victory declare for them decisively, it was easy to foretell\nwhat would happen. Tu Kiu falling back in disorder would confuse the\nregiments of Choo Hoo coming to his assistance, a panic would arise, and\nthe incredible host of the barbarians would encumber each other's\nflight.\n\nKapchack listened to the Khan with the deepest attention, approved of\nall he had put forward, and gave the order to attack Tu Kiu.\n\nWithout a sound--for Ah Kurroo had strictly enjoined silence, lest the\nunusual noise should betray that something was intended--the legions\nfell into rank, and at the word of command, suppressing even the shout\nof joy which they wished so much to utter, moved in a dense column to\nthe southwards. Kapchack, with his guards behind him, and Ah Kurroo\nKhan at his side, led the van.\n\nThe Khan secretly congratulated himself as he flew upon his\nextraordinary good fortune, that he should thus enter the field of\nbattle unhampered with any restrictions, and without the useless and\nunpleasant companionship of a political officer, appointed by the\ncouncil of his nation. Well he knew that had Kapchack given the least\nnotice of his intention, the rook council would have assembled and held\ninterminable discussions upon the best method of carrying out the\nproposed object, ending, as usual, with a vote in which mere numbers\nprevailed, without any reference to reason or experience, and with the\nappointment of a state official to overlook the conduct of the general,\nand to see that he did not arrogate too much to himself.\n\nThus in fact the rooks were accustomed to act, lest a commander should\nbecome too victorious. They liked indeed to win, and to destroy the\nenemy, and to occupy his territory, but they did not like all this to be\naccomplished by one man, but the rather, at the very zenith of his fame,\nprovided him with an opportunity for disgracing himself, so that another\nmight take his place and divide the glory. Ah Kurroo knew all this;\nimagine, then, his joy that Kapchack without calling parliament together\nhad come direct to the camp, and ordered an immediate advance. Himself\nchoosing the route, trusting to no guides, not even to his own\nintelligence department, Ah Kurroo pointed the way, and the legions\nwith steady and unvarying flight followed their renowned commander.\n\nThe noise of their wings resounded, the air was oppressed with their\nweight and the mighty mass in motion. Then did Kapchack indeed feel\nhimself every feather a king. He glanced back--he could not see the\nrear-guard, so far did the host extend. His heart swelled with pride and\neagerness for the fight. Now quitting the plain, they wound by a devious\nroute through the hills--the general's object being to so manage the\nmarch that none of them should appear above the ridges. The woods upon\nthe slopes concealed their motions, and the advance was executed without\nthe least delay, though so great was their length in this extended order\nthat when the head of the column entered the plain beyond, the\nrear-guard had not reached the hills behind. This rendered their front\nextremely narrow, but Ah Kurroo, pausing when he had gone half-a-mile\ninto the plain, and when the enemy were already in sight, and actually\nbeneath them, ordered the leading ranks to beat time with their wings,\nwhile their comrades came up.\n\nThus, in a few minutes, the place where the narrow valley debouched into\nthe hill-surrounded plain, was darkened with the deploying rooks.\nKapchack, while waiting, saw beneath him the hurrying squadrons of Tu\nKiu. From the cut corn, from the stubble, from the furrows (where\nalready the plough had begun its work), from the green roots and second\ncrops of clover, from the slopes of the hills around, and the distant\nridges, the alarmed warriors were crowding to their standards.\n\nWhile peacefully foraging, happy in the sunshine and the abundance of\nfood, without a thought of war and war's hazards, they suddenly found\nthemselves exposed, all unprepared, to the fell assault of their black\nand mortal enemies. The sky above them seemed darkened with the legions,\nthe hoarse shouts of command as the officers deployed their ranks, the\nbeating of the air, struck them with terror. Some, indeed, overwhelmed\nwith affright, cowered on the earth; a few of the outlying bands, who\nhad wandered farthest, turned tail and fled over the ridges. But the\nmajority, veterans in fight, though taken aback, and fully recognising\nthe desperate circumstances under which they found themselves, hastened\nwith all speed towards Tu Kiu, whose post was in a hedge, in which stood\nthree low ash-trees by a barn. This was about the centre of the plain,\nand thither the squadrons and companies hurried, hoarsely shouting for\ntheir general.\n\nTu Kiu, undismayed, and brave as became the son and heir of the mighty\nEmperor Choo Hoo, made the greatest efforts to get them into some kind\nof array and order. Most fell into rank of their own accord from long\nuse and habit, but the misfortune was that no sooner had one regiment\nformed than fresh arrivals coming up threw all into disorder again. The\ncrowd, the countless multitude overwhelmed itself; the air was filled,\nthe earth covered, they struck against each other, and Tu Kiu, hoarse\nwith shouting, was borne down, and the branch of ash upon which he\nstood broken with the weight of his own men. He struggled, he called, he\ncried; his voice was lost in the din and clangour.\n\nAh Kurroo Khan, soaring with Kapchack, while the legions deployed,\nmarked the immense confusion of the enemy's centre. He seized the\nmoment, gave the command, and in one grand charge the whole army bore\nswiftly down upon Tu Kiu. Kapchack himself could scarce keep pace with\nthe increasing velocity of the charge; he was wrapped, as it were,\naround with the dense and serried ranks, and found himself hurled in a\nmoment into the heart of the fight. Fight, indeed, it could not be\ncalled.\n\nThe solid phalanx of the rooks swept through the confused multitude\nbefore them, by their mere momentum cutting it completely in two, and\ncrushing innumerable combatants underneath. In a minute, in less than a\nminute, the mighty host of Tu Kiu, the flower of Choo Hoo's army, was\nswept from the earth. He himself, wounded and half-stunned by the shock,\nwas assisted from the scene by the unwearied efforts of his personal\nattendants.\n\nEach tried to save himself regardless of the rest; the oldest veteran,\nappalled by such utter defeat, could not force himself to turn again and\ngather about the leaders. One mass of fugitives filled the air; the\nslopes of the hills were covered with them. Still the solid phalanx of\nKapchack pressed their rear, pushing them before it.\n\nTu Kiu, who, weary and faint, had alighted for a moment upon an ancient\ngrass-grown earthwork--a memorial of former wars--which crowned a hill,\nfound it necessary to again flee with his utmost speed, lest he should\nbe taken captive.\n\nIt was now that the genius of Ah Kurroo Khan showed itself in its most\nbrilliant aspect. Kapchack, intoxicated with battle, hurried the legions\non to the slaughter--it was only by personal interference that the Khan\ncould restrain the excited king. Ah Kurroo, calm and far-seeing in the\nvery moment of victory, restrained the legions, held them in, and not\nwithout immense exertion succeeded in checking the pursuit, and\nretaining the phalanx in good order. To follow a host so completely\nrouted was merely to slay the slain, and to waste the strength that\nmight profitably be employed elsewhere. He conjectured that so soon as\never the news reached Choo Hoo, the emperor, burning with indignation,\nwould arouse his camp, call his army together, and without waiting to\nrally Tu Kiu's division, fly immediately to retrieve this unexpected\ndisaster. Thus, the victors must yet face a second enemy, far more\nnumerous than the first, under better generalship, and prepared for the\nconflict.\n\nAh Kurroo was, even now, by no means certain of the ultimate result. The\nrooks, indeed, were flushed with success, and impelled with all the\nvigour of victory; their opponents, however brave, must in some degree\nfeel the depression attendant upon serious loss. But the veterans with\nChoo Hoo not only outnumbered them, and could easily outflank or\nentirely surround, but would also be under the influence of his personal\nleadership. They looked upon Choo Hoo, not as their king, or their\ngeneral only, but as their prophet, and thus the desperate valour of\nfanaticism must be reckoned in addition to their natural courage.\nInstead, therefore, of relying simply upon force, Ah Kurroo, even in the\nexcitement of the battle, formed new schemes, and aimed to out-general\nthe emperor.\n\nHe foresaw that Choo Hoo would at once march to the attack, and would\ncome straight as a line to the battle-field. His plan was to wheel\nround, and, making a detour, escape the shock of Choo Hoo's army for the\nmoment, and while Choo Hoo was looking for the legions that had\noverthrown his son, to fall upon and occupy his undefended camp. He was\nin hopes that when the barbarians found their rear threatened, and their\ncamp in possession of the enemy, a panic would seize upon them.\n\nKapchack, when he had a little recovered from the frenzy of the fray,\nfully concurred, and without a minute's delay Ah Kurroo proceeded to\ncarry out this strategical operation. He drew off the legions for some\ndistance by the same route they had come, and then, considering that he\nhad gone far enough to avoid Choo Hoo, turned sharp to the left, and\nflew straight for the emperor's camp, sheltered from view on the side\ntowards it by a wood, and in front by an isolated hill, also crowned\nwith trees. Once over that hill, and Choo Hoo's camp must inevitably\nfall into their hands. With swift, steady flight, the dark legions\napproached the hill, and were now within half-a-mile of it, when to Ah\nKurroo's surprise and mortification the van-guard of Choo Hoo appeared\nabove it, advancing directly upon them.\n\nWhen the fugitives from the field of battle reached Choo Hoo, he could\nat first scarce restrain his indignation, for he had deemed the treaty\nin full force; he exclaimed against the perfidy of a Power which called\nitself civilised and reproached his host as barbarians, yet thus\nviolated its solemn compacts. But recognising the gravity of the\nsituation, and that there was no time to waste in words, he gave orders\nfor the immediate assembly of his army, and while the officers carried\nout his command flew to a lofty fir to consider a few moments alone upon\nthe course he should take.\n\nHe quickly decided that to attempt to rally Tu Kiu's division would be\nin vain; he did not even care to protect its retreat, for as it had been\ntaken so unawares, it must suffer the penalty of indiscretion. To march\nstraight to the field of battle, and to encounter a solid phalanx of the\nbest troops in the world, elated with victory, and led by a general like\nAh Kurroo, and inspired, too, by the presence of their king, while his\nown army was dispirited at this unwonted reverse, would be courting\ndefeat. He resolved to march at once, but to make a wide detour, and so\nto fall upon the rooks in their rear while they were pursuing Tu Kiu.\nThe signal was given, and the vast host set out.\n\nThus the two generals, striving to outwit each other, suddenly found\nthemselves coming into direct collision. While fancying that they had\narranged to avoid each other, they came, as it were, face to face, and\nso near, that Choo Hoo, flying at the head of his army, easily\ndistinguished King Kapchack and the Khan. It seemed now inevitable that\nsheer force must decide between them.\n\nBut Choo Hoo, the born soldier, no sooner cast his keen glance over the\nfields which still intervened, than he detected a fatal defect in\nKapchack's position. The rooks, not expecting attack, were advancing in\na long dense column, parallel with, and close to, a rising ground, all\nalong the summit of which stood a row of fine beech-trees. Quick as\nthought, Choo Hoo commanded his centre to slacken their speed while\nfacing across the line the rooks were pursuing. At the same time he sent\nfor his left to come up at the double in extended order, so as to\noutflank Ah Kurroo's column, and then to push it, before it could\ndeploy, bodily, and by mere force of numbers, against the beeches, where\ntheir wings entangled and their ranks broken by the boughs they must\nbecome confused. Then his right, coming up swiftly, would pass over, and\nsweep the Khan's disordered army before it.\n\nThis manoeuvre, so well-conceived, was at once begun. The barbarian\ncentre slackened over the hill, and their left, rushing forward,\nenclosed Ah Kurroo's column, and already bore down towards it, while the\nnoise of their right could be heard advancing towards the beeches above,\nand on the other side of which it would pass. Ah Kurroo saw his\ndanger--he could discover no possible escape from the trap in which he\nwas caught, except in the desperate valour of his warriors. He shouted\nto them to increase their speed, and slightly swerving to his right,\ndirected his course straight towards Choo Hoo himself. Seeing his\ndesign--to bear down the rebel emperor, or destroy him before the battle\ncould well begin--Kapchack shouted with joy, and hurried forward to be\nthe first to assail his rival.\n\nAlready the advancing hosts seemed to feel the shock of the combat, when\na shadow fell upon them, and they observed the eclipse of the sun. Till\nthat moment, absorbed in the terrible work they were about, neither the\nrank and file nor the leaders had noticed the gradual progress of the\ndark semicircle over the sun's disk. The ominous shadow fell upon them,\nstill more awful from its suddenness. A great horror seized the serried\nhosts. The prodigy in the heavens struck the conscience of each\nindividual; with one consent they hesitated to engage in carnage with so\nterrible a sign above them.\n\nIn the silence of the pause they heard the pheasants crow, and the fowls\nfly up to roost; the lesser birds hastened to the thickets. A strange\ndulness stole over their senses, they drooped, as it were; the\nbarbarians sank to the lower atmosphere; the rooks, likewise overcome\nwith this mysterious lassitude, ceased to keep their regular ranks, and\nsome even settled on the beeches.\n\nChoo Hoo himself struggled in vain against the omen; his mighty mind\nrefused to succumb to an accident like this; but his host was not so\nbold of thought. With desperate efforts he managed indeed to shake off\nthe physical torpor which endeavoured to master him; he shouted\n\"Koos-takke!\" but for the first time there was no response. The\nbarbarians, superstitious as they were ignorant, fell back, and lost\nthat unity of purpose which is the soul of an army. The very\nsuperstition and fanaticism which had been his strength was now Choo\nHoo's weakness. His host visibly melted before his eyes; the vast mass\ndissolved; the ranks became mixed together, without order or cohesion.\nRage overpowered him; he stormed; he raved till his voice from the\nstrain became inaudible. The barbarians were cowed, and did not heed\nhim.\n\nThe rooks, less superstitious, because more civilised, could not,\nnevertheless, view the appearance of the sun without dismay, but as\ntheir elders were accustomed to watch the sky, and to deduce from its\naspect the proper time for nesting, they were not so over-mastered with\nterror as the enemy; but they were equally subjected by the mysterious\ndesire of rest which seized upon them. They could not advance; they\ncould scarce float in the air; some, as already observed, sought the\nbranches of the beeches. Ah Kurroo, however, bearing up as well as he\ncould against this strange languor, flew to and fro along the disordered\nranks, begging them to stand firm, and at least close up if they could\nnot advance, assuring them that the shadow would shortly pass, and that\nif they could only retain their ranks victory was certain, for the\nbarbarians were utterly demoralised.\n\nThe drowsy rooks mechanically obeyed his orders, they closed their ranks\nas well as they could; they even feebly cheered him. But more than this\nthey could not do. Above them the sun was blotted out, all but a rim of\neffulgent light, from which shone forth terrible and threatening flames.\nSome whispered that they saw the stars. Suddenly while they gazed,\noppressed with awe, the woods rang with a loud cry, uttered by Kapchack.\n\nThe king, excited beyond measure, easily withstood the slumberous\nheaviness which the rest could scarce sustain. He watched the efforts of\nthe Khan with increasing impatience and anger. Then seeing that although\nthe army closed up it did not move, he lost all control of himself. He\nshouted his defiance of the rebels before him, and rushed alone--without\none single attendant--across the field towards Choo Hoo. In amazement at\nhis temerity, the rooks watched him as if paralysed for a moment. Choo\nHoo himself could scarce face such supernatural courage; when suddenly\nthe rooks, as if moved by one impulse, advanced. The clangour of their\nwings resounded, a hoarse shout arose from their throats, they strained\nevery nerve to overtake and assist their king.\n\nKapchack, wild with desperate courage, was within twenty yards of Choo\nHoo, when the dense column of his own army passed him and crushed into\nthe demoralised multitude of the enemy, as a tree overthrown by the\nwind crushes the bushes beneath it. Kapchack himself whirled round and\nround, and borne he knew not whither, scarce recognised whom he struck,\nbut wreaked his vengeance till his sinews failed him, and he was forced\nto hold from sheer weariness. It is not possible to describe the scene\nthat now took place. The whole plain, the woods, the fields, were hidden\nwith the hurrying mass of the fugitives, above and mixed with whom the\nblack and terrible legions dealt destruction.\n\nWidening out as it fled, the host of Choo Hoo was soon scattered over\nmiles of country. None stayed to aid another; none even asked the other\nthe best route to a place of safety; all was haste and horror. The\npursuit, indeed, only ended with evening; for seven long hours the\nvictors sated their thirst for slaughter, and would hardly have stayed\neven then had not the disjointed and weary fragments of Choo Hoo's army\nfound some refuge now in a forest.\n\nChoo Hoo himself only escaped from the ruck by his extraordinary\npersonal strength; once free from the confused mass, his speed, in which\nhe surpassed all the barbarians, enabled him to easily avoid capture.\nBut as he flew his heart was dead within him, for there was no hope of\nretrieving this overwhelming disaster.\n\nMeantime King Kapchack, when compelled by sheer physical weariness to\nfall out from the pursuit, came down and rested upon an oak. While he\nsat there alone and felt his strength returning, the sun began to come\nforth again from the shadow, and to light up the land with renewed\nbrilliance. His attendants, who had now discovered his whereabouts,\ncrowding round him with their congratulations, seized upon this\ncircumstance as a fortunate omen. The dark shadow, they said, was past;\nlike the sun, Kapchack had emerged to shine brighter than before. For\nonce, indeed, the voice of flattery could not over-estimate the\nmagnitude of this glorious victory.\n\nIt utterly destroyed the invading host, which for years had worked its\nway slowly into the land. It destroyed the prestige of Choo Hoo; never\nagain would his race regard him as their invincible chief. It raised the\nreputation of King Kapchack to the skies. It crushed all domestic\ntreason with one blow. If Kapchack was king before, now he was\nabsolutely autocratic.\n\nWhere now was Ki Ki, the vainglorious hawk who had deemed that without\nhis aid nothing could be accomplished? Where the villainous crow, the\nsombre and dark designing Kauc, whose murderous poniard would be thrust\ninto his own breast with envy? Where the cunning weasel, whose intrigues\nwere swept away like spiders' webs? Where were they all? They were\nutterly at Kapchack's mercy. Mercy indeed! at his _mercy_--their instant\nexecution was already certain. His body-guard, crowding about him,\nalready began the pæan.\n\nHe set out to return to his palace, flushed with a victory of which\nhistory furnishes no parallel. It would have been well if he had\ncontinued in this intention to at once return, summon his council, and\nproclaim the traitors. Had he gone direct thither he must have met Eric,\nthe missel-thrush, who alone was permitted to frequent the orchard.\nEric, alarmed at seeing a stranger in the orchard, and at the\nunprecedented circumstance of his ascending the ladder into the\napple-tree, had started away to find the king, and warn him that\nsomething unusual was happening, and not to return till the coast was\nclear. He had not yet heard of the battle, or rather double battle that\nmorning, nor did he know which way Kapchack had gone, but he considered\nthat most probably the woodpecker could tell him, and therefore flew\ndirect towards the copse to inquire.\n\nIf Kapchack had continued his flight straight to his palace he would\nhave passed over the copse, and the missel-thrush would have seen him\nand delivered his message. But as he drew near home Kapchack saw the\nclump of trees which belonged to Ki Ki not far distant upon his right.\nThe fell desire of vengeance seized upon him; he turned aside, intending\nto kill Ki Ki with his own beak, but upon approaching nearer he saw that\nthe trees were vacant. Ki Ki, indeed, had had notice of the victory from\nhis retainers soaring in the air, and guessing that the king's first\nstep would be to destroy him, had instantly fled. Kapchack, seeing that\nthe hawk was not there, again pursued his return journey, but meantime\nthe missel-thrush had passed him.\n\nThe king was now within a few hundred yards of his fortress, the dome of\nhis palace was already visible, and the voices of his attendants rose\nhigher and higher in their strain of victory. The missel-thrush had seen\nthe woodpecker, who informed him that Kapchack had just passed, and like\nthe wind he rushed back to the orchard. But all the speed of his wings\nwas in vain, he could not quite overtake the monarch; he shouted, he\nshrieked, but the song of triumph drowned his cries. Kapchack was close\nto the wall of the orchard.\n\nAt the same time Bevis, not caring much about the locket or the letter,\nor the old gentleman (whose history he had not yet heard), while his\npapa spoke to, and aroused the old gentleman from his swoon, had slipped\nback towards the orchard-gate where was an irresistible attraction. This\nwas the sportsman's double-barrelled gun, leant there against a tree. He\ncould scarce keep his hands off it; he walked round it; touched it;\nlooked about to see if any one was watching, and was just on the point\nof taking hold of it, when the old gentleman rushed past, but seeing the\ngun, stopped and seized it. Finding, however, that it was not loaded, he\nthrew it aside, and went on towards the house. In a minute he returned\nwith the long single-barrelled gun, with which, so many years before, he\nhad vowed to shoot his rival.\n\nHe had heard the magpie returning, and mad with anger--since it was the\nmagpie's theft which had thus destroyed the happiness of his life, for\nall might have been well had he had the letter--he hastened for his\ngun. As he came to the orchard-gate, Kapchack, with his followers behind\nhim, neared the wall. The avenger looked along his gun, pulled the\ntrigger, and the report echoed from the empty, hollow house. His aim was\nuncertain in the agony of his mind, and even then Kapchack almost\nescaped, but one single pellet, glancing from the bough of an\napple-tree, struck his head, and he fell with darkness in his eyes.\n\nThe old gentleman rushed to the spot, he beat the senseless body with\nthe butt of his gun till the stock snapped; then he jumped on it, and\nstamped the dead bird into a shapeless remnant upon the ground. At this\nspectacle Bevis, who, although he was always talking of shooting and\nkilling, could not bear to see anything really hurt, burst out into a\npassion of tears, lamenting the magpie, and gathering up some of the\nfeathers. Nor could they pacify him till they found him a ripe and\ngolden King Pippin apple to eat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. PALACE SECRETS.\n\n\nNext day Sir Bevis, so soon as ever he could get away after dinner, and\nwithout waiting for the noontide heat to diminish, set out in all haste\nfor the copse, taking with him his cannon-stick. He was full of\ncuriosity to know what would happen now that Kapchack was dead, who\nwould now be king, and everything about it, all of which he knew he\nshould learn from the squirrel. He took his cannon-stick with him\nheavily loaded, and the charge rammed home well, meaning to shoot the\nweasel; if the wretch would not come out when called upon to receive the\ndue punishment of his crimes, he would bang it off into his hole in the\ntree, and, perhaps, some of the shot would reach the skulking vagabond.\n\nHe went up the field, reached the great oak-tree, and crossed over to\nthe corner of the wheat-field, but neither the hare nor the dragon-fly\nwere waiting about to conduct him, as was their duty. He sat down on the\ngrass to see if they would come to him, but although two dragon-flies\npassed over they did not stay to speak, but went on their journey.\nNeither of them was his guide, but they both went towards the copse.\nImmediately afterwards a humble-bee came along, droning and talking to\nhimself as he flew. \"Where is the hare?\" said Bevis; \"and where is the\ndragon-fly?\" \"Buzz,\" said the humble-bee, \"the usual course on occasions\nlike the present--buzz--zz,\" the sound of his voice died away as he went\npast without replying. Three swallows swept by next at a great pace,\nchattering as they flew.\n\n\"Where's my dragon-fly?\" said Bevis, but they were too busy to heed him.\nPresently a dove flew over too high to speak to, and then a\nmissel-thrush, and soon afterwards ten rooks, after whom came a whole\nbevy of starlings, and behind these a train of finches. Next a thrush\ncame along the low hedge, then two blackbirds, all so quick that Bevis\ncould not make them understand him. A crow too appeared, but catching\nsight of Bevis's cannon-stick, he smelt the powder, wheeled round and\nwent by far to the left hand out of talking distance. Still more\nstarlings rushed overhead, and Bevis waved his hand to them, but it was\nno use. Just afterwards he saw a thrush coming, so he jumped up, pointed\nhis cannon-stick, and said he would shoot if the thrush did not stop.\nMuch frightened, the thrush immediately perched on the hedge, and begged\nBevis not to kill him, for he remembered the fate of his relation who\nwas shot with the same cannon.\n\n\"Tell me where the hare is, and where is my dragon-fly,\" said Bevis;\n\"and why are all the people hurrying away towards the copse, and why\ndon't they stop and tell me, and what is all this about?\"\n\n\"I do not know exactly where the hare is,\" said the\nthrush, \"but I suppose she is in the copse too, and I have no doubt at\nall the dragon-fly is there, and I am going myself so soon as you will\nlet me.\"\n\n\"Why are you all going to the copse?\" said Bevis. \"Is it because\nKapchack is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the thrush, \"it is because the king is dead, and there is\ngoing to be an election, that is if there is time, or if it can be\nmanaged; for it is expected that Choo Hoo will return now Kapchack is\noverthrown.\"\n\n\"When did Choo Hoo go, then?\" asked Bevis--for he had not yet heard of\nthe battle. So the thrush told him all about it, and how strange it was\nthat King Kapchack in the hour of victory should be slain by the very\nman who for so many years had protected him. The thrush said that the\nnews had no doubt reached Choo Hoo very soon afterwards, and everybody\nexpected that the barbarians would gather together again, and come back\nto take vengeance, and so, as they now had no king or leader, they were\nall hastening to the copse to take sanctuary from Choo Hoo. The only\ndoubt was whether the emperor would respect the enclosure hitherto\nregarded by all the civilised people as a place where they could meet\nwithout danger. The barbarians knew nothing of these tacit agreements,\nwhich make communication so easy and pleasant among educated people.\nStill there was nothing else they could do.\n\n\"And what is going on in the copse?\" said Bevis, \"and who is to be\nking?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" said the thrush, \"I was just going to see, and if\npossible to vote against Ki Ki, who treacherously slew my friend and\nrelation the ambassador, whom the king sent to Choo Hoo.\"\n\n\"We will go together,\" said Bevis, \"and you can tell me some more about\nit as we go along. One thing is quite certain, the weasel will never be\nking.\"\n\n\"Before I go with you,\" said the thrush, \"you must please leave off\npointing that dreadful cannon-stick at me, else I shall not be able to\nconverse freely.\"\n\nSo Bevis left off pointing it, and carried his gun over his shoulder,\njust as he had seen his papa carry his. The thrush flew slowly along\nbeside him, but he could not quite manage to keep at exactly the same\npace; his wings would carry him faster than Bevis walked, so he stopped\non the ground every now and then for Bevis to come up.\n\n\"I am sure,\" he said, \"I hope the weasel will not be king, and there is\na rumour going about that he is disabled by some accident he has met\nwith. But I greatly fear myself that he will be, notwithstanding what\nyou say, for he is so cunning, and has so terrible a reputation that no\none can prevail against him.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Bevis, \"don't tell me such stuff and rubbish; I say the\nweasel shall not be king, for I am going to shoot him as dead as any\nnail; after which Pan shall tear him into twenty pieces.\"\n\n\"But you tried to kill him once before, did you not?\" said the thrush.\n\n\"You hold your tongue, this minute, you impudent thrush,\" said Bevis, in\na great rage; and he took his cannon-stick off his shoulder, and looked\nso black that the thrush, alarmed for his safety, took advantage of a\nhedge being near, and slipped through it in a second.\n\n\"I'm very glad you're gone,\" said Bevis, calling after him, \"but I'll\nshoot you next time I see you for leaving me without permission.\"\n\n\"And that will just serve him right,\" said a blackbird, as he hastened\nby, \"for the thrush is the greediest bird in the world, and is always\npoaching about the places that belong to me.\"\n\nBevis was now very near the copse, and had not the least difficulty in\nfinding the little bridge over the ditch, but he stopped before he\ncrossed it, to listen to the noise there was inside among the trees.\nWhenever he had come before in the afternoon it was always so quiet, but\nnow there was a perfect uproar of talking. Hundreds of starlings were\nchattering in the fir-trees, and flying round the branches with\nincessant motion. In the thick hedge which enclosed it there were crowds\nof greenfinches, goldfinches, chaffinches, yellow-hammers, and sparrows,\nwho never ceased talking. Up in the elms there were a number of rooks,\nwho were deliberating in a solemn manner; it was indeed the rook council\nwho had met there to consider as the safest place, the very council that\nAh Kurroo so much disliked. Two or three dozen wood-pigeons cowered on\nthe lower branches of some ashes; they were the aliens who dwelt in\nKapchack's kingdom. Rabbits were rushing about in all directions;\ndragon-flies darting up and down with messages; humble-bees droning at\nevery corner; the woodpecker yelled out his views in the midst of the\nwood; everything was in confusion.\n\nAs Bevis walked into the copse along the green track, with the tall\nthistles and the fern on each side of him, he caught little bits here\nand there of what they were saying; it was always the same, who was\ngoing to be king, and what would Choo Hoo do? How long would it be\nbefore the emperor's army could be got together again to come sweeping\nback and exact a dire vengeance for its defeat? Where was the weasel?\nWhat was the last atrocity Ki Ki had committed? Had anybody heard\nanything more of Kauc, the crow? Had Prince Tchack-tchack arrived? Had\nthe rooks made up their mind?--and so on, till Bevis shook his head and\nheld his hands to his ears, so tremendous was the din.\n\nJust then he saw his own dragon-fly and beckoned to him; the dragon-fly\ncame at once. \"What is all this?\" began Bevis.\n\n\"My dear, how are you?\" interrupted the dragon-fly. \"I am so busy,\" and\noff he went again.\n\n\"Well I never!\" said Bevis, getting excited like the rest, when the hare\ncame across the path and stopped to speak to him. \"What is going on?\"\nsaid Bevis.\n\n\"That is just what I want to know,\" said the hare. \"Everybody says that\nsomebody is going to do something, but what it is they do not themselves\nknow. There never was such a confusion, and, for aught we know, Choo\nHoo may be here any minute, and there's not a single regiment in\nposition.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Bevis, \"why ever don't they begin?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" said the hare. \"I don't think anybody knows how:\nand the fact is, they are all thinking about who shall be king, and\nintriguing for the sovereignty, when they should be thinking of their\ncountry, and providing for its defence.\"\n\n\"And who is to be king?\" said Bevis. \"The weasel shall not, that is\ncertain; for I am just this very minute going to shoot into his hole!\"\n\n\"It is no use to do that,\" said the hare; \"though I am very glad to hear\nyou say that he shall not be king. But it is no use shooting into his\nhole, for he is not there, nor anywhere in his old haunts, and we are\nall very suspicious as to what he is about. I think you had better come\nand see the squirrel; he is in the raspberries, and the jay is there\ntoo, and there is an immense deal of talking going on.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Bevis; and he followed the hare to the raspberries\n(all the fruit was now gone), and found the squirrel, who advanced to\nwelcome him, and the jay up in the oak. Being hot with walking in the\nsun, Bevis sat down on the moss at the foot of the oak, and leaned back\nagainst the tree whose beautiful boughs cast so pleasant a shadow. The\nhare came close to him on one side, and the squirrel the other, and the\njay perched just overhead, and they all began to tell him the news at\nonce. Not able to understand what they meant while they were all\nspeaking together, Bevis held up his hands and begged them to stop a\nminute, and then asked the squirrel to explain.\n\n\"So I will,\" said the squirrel, \"though I ought to be hiding my stores\nas fast as I can from the voracious host of barbarians, who will be here\nin a minute. But what am I to do? for I cannot get anybody to help\nme--everybody is thinking about himself.\"\n\n\"But the story--the story!\" said Bevis; \"tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"Well, since I can do nothing,\" said the squirrel, \"I suppose I must,\nthough there is not a great deal to tell. You must know, then, that the\nnews of Kapchack's death got here in half-a-minute, for the\nmissel-thrush came with it, and from here it was all over the country in\nless than an hour. Everybody knew it except Ah Kurroo Khan and the\nvictorious legions, and Choo Hoo and the flying enemy. These were so\nbusy, the one with slaughter, and the other with trying to escape, that\nthey could not listen to what the swifts at once flew to tell them, but\ncontinued to fight and fly away till the evening, when the fragments of\nChoo Hoo's army took refuge in the forest. Even then they would not\nbelieve so extraordinary a circumstance, but regarded the account that\nhad reached them as one of the rumours which always fly about at such\ntimes. Choo Hoo continued to go from tree to tree deeper and deeper into\nthe forest.\n\n\"Ah Kurroo Khan, calling off his legions, since nothing further could be\ndone, drew his victorious army back to some isolated clumps and\navenues, where they intended to make their camp for the night. But in\nthe course of an hour the rumours increased so much, and so many\nmessengers arrived with the same intelligence and additional\nparticulars, that Ah Kurroo Khan, dreading lest it should be true, sent\nout a squadron to ascertain the facts.\n\n\"Long before it could return, an envoy arrived from the council of the\nrooks themselves, with an order to Ah Kurroo Khan to retire at once,\nnotwithstanding the lateness of the evening, and that the sun was\nsinking.\n\n\"With much disappointment (for he had hoped to continue the pursuit, and\nentirely exterminate the barbarians on the morrow), and not without\nforebodings as to his own fate, Ah Kurroo reluctantly communicated the\norder to his troops. The wearied legions accordingly started on their\nhomeward journey, slowly passing over the fields which had witnessed the\nconquest of the morning. The sun had already sunk when their van reached\nthe rooks' city, and Ah Kurroo came to the front to deliver the report\nhe had prepared upon his way. As he approached the trees where the\ncouncil of the rooks was sitting, in dark and ominous silence, an\nofficial stopped him, and informed him that he had been dismissed from\nthe command, degraded from the rank he held, and the title of Khan taken\nfrom him. He was to retire to a solitary tree at some distance, and\nconsider himself under arrest.\n\n\"Thus they punished him for daring to move without their orders (even at\nthe direct instance of the king), and thus was he rewarded for winning\nthe greatest battle known to history. The legions were immediately\ndisbanded, and each individual ordered to his home. Meantime, the news\nhad at last reached Choo Hoo, but neither he, nor the fugitive host,\ncould believe it, till there arrived some of the aliens who had dwelt\nwith us, and who assured the barbarians that it was correct. Directly\nafterwards, the intelligence was confirmed by the retreat of Ah Kurroo\nKhan.\n\n\"All that livelong night Choo Hoo, once more beginning to hope, flew to\nand fro from tree to tree, endeavouring to animate his host afresh with\nspirit for the fight; and as messengers continually came in with fresh\nparticulars of the confusion in Kapchack's kingdom, he began to succeed.\nEarly this morning, when the sun rose, the mystic syllables,\n'Koos-takke,' resounded once more; the forest was alive, and echoed with\nthe clattering of their wings, as the army drew together and re-formed\nits ranks. The barbarians, easily moved by omens, saw in the\nextraordinary death of Kapchack the very hand of fate. Once more they\nbelieved in their emperor; once more Choo Hoo advanced at their head.\n\n\"Not half-an-hour since a starling came in with the intelligence that\nChoo Hoo's advanced guard had already reached his old camp. We suppose\nthe barbarians will halt there a little while for refreshment, and then\nmove down upon us in a mass. Would you believe it, instead of preparing\nfor defence, the whole state is rent with faction and intrigue! Yonder\nthe council of the rooks, wise as they are, are indeed deliberating,\nhaving retired here for greater safety lest their discussion should be\nsuddenly interrupted by the enemy; but the subject of this discussion is\nnot how to defend the country, but what punishment they shall inflict\nupon Ah Kurroo. There is a difference of opinion. Some hold that the\nestablished penalty for his offence is to break his wings and hurl him\nhelpless from the top of the tallest elm. Some, more merciful, are for\nbanishment, that he be outlawed, and compelled to build his nest and\nroost on an isolated tree, exposed to all the insults of the crows. The\nolder members of the council, great sticklers for tradition, maintain\nthat the ancient and only adequate punishment is the hanging up of the\noffender by one leg to a dead and projecting branch, there to dangle and\ndie of starvation, a terror to all such evil-doers.\n\n\"While they thus talk of torture the enemy is in sight, and their own\narmy, it is more than whispered, is discontented and angry at the\nreception meted out to the victorious Khan. But this, alas! is not all.\n\n\"So soon as ever Ki Ki was certain that Kapchack was really dead, he\nreturned, and he has gathered to himself a crew of the most terrible\nruffians you ever beheld. He has got about him all the scum of the\nearth; all the blackguards, villains, vermin, cut-throat scoundrels have\nrallied to his standard; as the old proverb says: 'Birds of a feather\nflock together'. He has taken possession of the firs, yonder, on the\nslope (which are the property of my friend the jay), and which command\nmy copse. He has proclaimed himself king, and seeks to obtain\nconfirmation of his title by terrorism. Already he has twice sent forth\nhis murderous banditti, who, scouring the fields, have committed fearful\nhavoc upon defenceless creatures. I am in dread every minute lest he\nshould descend upon the copse itself, for he respects no law of earth or\nheaven.\n\n\"At the same time Kauc, the crow, has come forth in his true colours; he\ntoo has proclaimed himself king. He has taken his stand in the trees by\nthe Long Pond--you came close by them just now--they are scarce a\nquarter of a mile hence. To our astonishment, he has got at least thrice\nas many retainers as he is entered to have in the roll which was read\nbefore Kapchack. He had reckoned, it seems, upon the assistance of\nCloctaw, of St. Paul's, who has great influence among the jackdaws.\nCloctaw, however, avoided him and came hither, and Kauc vows he will\ndestroy him.\n\n\"I know not which is most formidable, the violent Ki Ki or the ruthless\nKauc. The latter, I feel sure, is only waiting till he sees an opening\nto rush in and slaughter us. There is not a generous sentiment in his\nbreast; he would not spare the fledgling in the nest. Between these two,\none on either hand, we are indeed in a fearful predicament; Choo Hoo is\nto be preferred to them.\n\n\"Whether Raoul, the rat, intends to strike a blow for the throne, I know\nnot; he is here; he bears an evil character, but for myself I like him\nfar better than Kauc or Ki Ki. The fox is, of course, out of the\nquestion. But my great fear is the weasel; should he obtain the throne\nwhich of us will be safe? By night as well as by day we shall be\ndecimated. His Machiavellian schemes, indeed, have thus far gone astray,\nand although he could arrange for everything, he could not foresee his\nown illness. Yet, though lying by now with a broken rib and other\ninjuries, I have not the least doubt he is weaving new webs and\npreparing fresh deceptions. Thus, while the invader threatens us hourly,\nthe kingdom of Kapchack is torn to pieces with the dissensions of those\nwho should defend it.\"\n\n\"But why does not Prince Tchack-tchack take the throne and be king?\"\nsaid Bevis. \"He is the heir; he is Kapchack's son.\"\n\n\"So he ought,\" said the squirrel; \"but the truth is, people are weary of\nthe rule of the magpies; nor is this young and flighty prince capable of\ntaking up the reins of state. He is vain, and dissipated, and\nuncertain--no one can depend upon him. And besides, even if they could,\nhave you not heard the extraordinary secret he has let out, like the\ngreat lout he is, and of which everybody is talking?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bevis; \"I have heard nothing--how should I? I have only just\ngot here. What is the secret? Tell me the secret this minute.\"\n\n\"To think,\" said the jay, \"that we should have been so long deceived.\nBut I had my suspicions.\"\n\n\"I cannot say I suspected anything,\" said the hare; \"but I remember Kauc\ndid make a very curious remark on one occasion; he was always looking\naskew into things and places that did not concern him, so that I did\nnot much heed, especially as he had started slanders about me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the jay, \"the truth is, my wife--she is, you know, the most\nbeautiful creature in the world, and quite turned the head of the late\nmonarch--told me that she all along had her ideas; and Kapchack himself\nindeed told her in confidence that he was not so old as he looked, being\njealous of the youth of Tchack-tchack, who objected to having his eye\npecked out, and his feathers ruffled, as if he had any claims to be\nhandsome;\" and the jay surveyed his own bright feathers with pride.\n\n\"You stupids!\" said Bevis, \"what is the use of talking in that way? I\nwant to know the secret.\"\n\n\"There is no secret,\" said the jay; \"and I am not stupid. How can there\nbe a secret, when everybody knows it?\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said the hare, trying to make peace; \"do not let us\nquarrel, at all events, if all the rest do.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the squirrel; \"certainly not.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" repeated the jay.\n\n\"Well, what is it, then?\" said Bevis, still frowning.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the squirrel, \"Tchack-tchack has babbled out the\ngreat state secret. I myself knew a little of it previously, having\noverheard the crow muttering to himself--as Ulu said, he peers into\nthings that do not concern him. And, if you remember, Bevis, I was in a\ngreat fright one day when I nearly let it out myself. Now Prince\nTchack-tchack, finding that he could not get the crown, has babbled\neverything in his rage, and the beautiful jay has told us many things\nthat prove it to be true. It now turns out that Kapchack was not\nKapchack at all.\"\n\n\"Not Kapchack!\" said Bevis. \"How could Kapchack not be Kapchack, when he\nwas Kapchack?\"\n\n\"Kapchack could not be Kapchack,\" said the squirrel, \"because he never\nwas Kapchack.\"\n\n\"Then who was Kapchack?\" said Bevis, in amazement.\n\n\"Well, he was not who he was,\" said the squirrel; \"and I will tell you\nwhy it was that he was not, if you will listen, and not keep\ninterrupting, and asking questions. The reed once told you how stupid it\nis to ask questions; you would understand everything very well, if you\ndid not trouble to make inquiries. The king who is just dead, and who\nwas called Kapchack, was not Kapchack, because the real old original\nKapchack died forty years ago.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Extraordinary!\" said the jay.\n\n\"Extraordinary!\" said the hare.\n\n\"But true,\" said the squirrel. \"The real old original Kapchack, the\ncleverest, cunningest, most consummate schemer who ever lived, who built\nthe palace in the orchard, and who played such fantastic freaks before\nthe loving couple, who won their hearts, and stole their locket and\nseparated them for ever (thinking that would serve his purpose best,\nsince if they married they would forget him, and have other things to\nthink about, while if they were apart he should be regarded as a sacred\nsouvenir), this marvellous genius, the founder of so illustrious a\nfamily, whose dominion stretched from here to the sea--I tell you that\n_this_ Kapchack, the real old original one, died forty years ago.\n\n\"But before he died, being so extremely cunning, he made provision for\nthe continuation of himself in this way. He reflected that he was very\nold, and that a good deal of the dignity he enjoyed was due to that\nfact. The owner of the orchard and warden of his fortress regarded him\nwith so much affection, because in his youth he had capered before the\nyoung lady whom he loved. It was not possible for the old gentleman to\ntransfer this affection to a young and giddy magpie, who had not seen\nany of these former things. Nor, looking outside the orchard wall, was\nit probable that the extensive kingdom he himself enjoyed would pass\nunder the sway of a youthful prince in its entirety.\n\n\"Some of the nobles would be nearly certain to revolt: the empire he had\nformed with so much labour, ingenuity, and risk, would fall to pieces,\nthe life of one ruler not being sufficiently long to consolidate it. The\nold king, therefore, as he felt the years pressing heavy upon him, cast\nabout in his mind for some means of securing his dynasty.\n\n\"After long cogitation one day he called to him his son and heir, a very\nhandsome young fellow, much like the Tchack-tchack whom we know, and\nmotioning him to come close, as if about to whisper in his ear, suddenly\npecked out his left eye. The vain young prince suffered not only from\nthe physical pain, but the intense mortification of knowing that his\nbeauty was destroyed for ever. If he wanted even to look at himself in\nthe pond, before he could see his own reflection, he had to turn his\nhead upon one side. He bitterly upbraided his unnatural father for this\ncruel deed: the queen joined in the reproaches, and the palace resounded\nwith rage and lamentation.\n\n\"Old King Kapchack the First bore all this disturbance with equanimity,\nsustained by the conviction that he had acted for the welfare of the\nroyal house he had founded. After a time, when the young one-eyed prince\nceased to complain, and was only sullen, he seized an opportunity when\nthey were alone in the apple-tree, and explained to him the reason why\nhe had done it.\n\n\"'I,' said he, 'I have founded this house, and through me you are\nregarded everywhere as of royal dignity; but if I were gone, the wicked\nand traitorous world which surrounds the throne would certainly begin to\nconspire against you on account of your youth; nor would the warden of\nthis orchard take any interest or defend you, as you were not the\nwitness of the caresses bestowed upon him by his young lady. If you look\nat me, you will see that a wound, received in the wars which I waged\nlong since, extinguished my left eye. You will also see that my tail is\nnot, to say the least, either so glossy or so ample as of yore, and my\nneck and temples are somewhat bare, partly because in those wars I\nreceived divers swashing blows upon my head, and partly because of my\nincreasing age.'\n\n\"The prince looked at him, and remarked that he certainly was a draggled\nold scarecrow. Not the least annoyed by this unfilial expression, the\nold king proceeded to show his heir how, in order for him, first, to\nretain the kingdom, and secondly, to keep the interest of the old\ngentleman owner of the orchard, it was necessary for him to present the\nsame appearance as Kapchack himself did. 'In short,' said he, 'when I\ndie you must be ready to take my place, and to look exactly like me.'\nThe prince began to see the point, and even to admire the cunning of his\nfather, but still he could not forgive the loss of his eye.\n\n\"'Ah!' said Kapchack I., 'you see I was obliged to take you upon the\nhop, otherwise it would never have been accomplished; no persuasion\ncould have induced you to submit to such a deprivation, and, now I am\nabout it, let me advise you, indeed, strictly enjoin upon you, when it\nbecomes your turn, and you, too, are old and failing, to do the same as\nI did. Do not tell your son and heir what you are going to do, or depend\nupon it he will slip aside and avoid you; but do it first. And now,\nsince you have already so far the same bleared aspect as myself, you\nwill feel no difficulty in submitting to certain curtailments behind,\nand to the depilation of your head and neck.'\n\n\"Well, the result was, that the prince, full of ambition, and\ndetermined to rule at any price, in the end submitted to these\ndisfigurations; the only thing he groaned over was the fear that none of\nthe young lady magpies would now have anything to say to him.\n\n\"'My dear and most dutiful son,' said the old king, greatly pleased at\nthe changed attitude of his heir, 'I assure you that you will not\nexperience any loss of attention upon that score. It is in early youth\nindeed a very prevalent mistake for gaudy young fellows (as you appeared\nthe other day) to imagine that it is the gloss of their feathers, the\nbrilliance of their eyes, and the carriage of their manly forms that\nobtains for them the smiles and favours of the fair. But, believe me,\nthis gratifying idea is not founded on fact; it is not the glossy\nfeather, or the manly form, my son, it is the wealth that you possess,\nand even more than that, the social dignity and rank, which is already\nyours, that has brought a circle of charming darlings around you.\n\n\"'It is certainly somewhat mortifying to feel that it is not ourselves\nthey care for, but merely the gratification of their own vanity. Of\ncourse you must bury this profound secret in your own breast. But if you\nponder over what I have said you will soon see how you can use this\nknowledge to your own advantage. And it will at least save you from the\nfolly of really falling in love, than which, my most dutiful son, there\nis no disease so terrible, and so lasting in its effects, as witness\nthat drivelling fool who keeps this orchard for us, and surrounds our\npalace as with an impregnable fortification. Believe me,\nnotwithstanding your now antique appearance--except at very close\nquarters, and without close examination (I don't think you have quite as\nmany crow's-feet round your cyclopean eye as myself), it is not possible\nto distinguish you from me--believe me, in spite of this, the circle of\ncharming darlings, reflecting that you are the heir to the greatest\ncrown in the universe, will discover that you are even more attractive\nthan before.'\n\n\"The prince in a day or two found that the old king was right, and\nrecovered much of his former spirit. As for the old king, having\nprovided for his dynasty, and feeling certain that his royal house would\nnow endure, he feasted and laughed, and cracked the oddest jokes you\never heard. One afternoon, after spending the whole time in this way, he\nrecollected that he had not yet informed his heir of one important\nsecret, namely, the entrance to his treasure house.\n\n\"This was a chink, covered over with an excrescence of the bark, in the\naged apple-tree, at the juncture of a large bough (the very bough that\nwas lately cracked by the hurricane), and it was here that he had\naccumulated the spoils of the many expeditions he had undertaken, the\nloot of provinces and the valuable property he had appropriated nearer\nhome, including the diamond locket. So cunningly had he chosen his\ntreasure vault that not one of all his courtiers, not even his queens,\ncould ever discover it, though they were all filled with the most\nintense desire and burning cupidity. The monarch thoroughly enjoyed the\njest, for all the time they were sitting right over it, and that was,\nno doubt, why they could not see it, being under their feet. Well, the\nold king recollected that afternoon that he had not communicated the\nsecret to his heir, and decided that the time had come when it was\nnecessary to do so. He therefore gave out that he felt sleepy after so\nmuch feasting, and desired his friends to leave him alone for a while,\nall except the missel-thrush (not the present, of course, but his\nancestor).\n\n\"Accordingly they all flew away to flirt in the copse, and so soon as\nthe court was clear the king told the missel-thrush to go and send his\nson to him, as he had something of importance to communicate in private.\nThe missel-thrush did as he was bid, and in about half-an-hour the young\nprince approached the palace. But when he came near he saw that the\nking, overcome perhaps by too much feasting, had dozed off into slumber.\nAs it was a rule in the palace that the monarch must never be awakened,\nthe prince perched silently close by.\n\n\"Now, while he was thus sitting waiting for the king to wake up, as he\nwatched him it occurred to him that if any one came by--as the warden of\nthe orchard and--saw the two magpies up in the tree, he would wonder\nwhich was which. Instead of one old Kapchack, lo! there would be two\nantique Kapchacks.\n\n\"Thought the prince: 'The king is very clever, exceedingly clever, but\nit seems to me that he has overreached himself. For certainly, if it is\ndiscovered that there are two old ones about, inquiries will be made,\nand a difficulty will arise, and it is not at all unlikely that one of\nus will be shot. It seems to me that the old fellow has lived a little\ntoo long, and that his wits are departing (here he gave a quiet hop\ncloser), and gone with his feathers, and it is about time I succeeded to\nthe throne. (Another hop closer.) In an empire like this, so recently\nfounded, the sceptre must be held in vigorous claws, and upon the whole,\nas there is no one about----' He gave a most tremendous peck upon the\npoor old king's head, and Kapchack fell to the ground, out of the tree,\nstone dead upon the grass.\n\n\"The prince turned his head upon one side, and looked down upon him;\nthen he quietly hopped into his place, shut his eye, and dozed off to\nsleep. By-and-by the courtiers ventured back by twos and threes, and\ngathered on the tree, respectfully waiting till he should awake, and\nnodding, and winking, and whispering to each other about the body in the\ngrass. Presently his royal highness woke up, yawned, complained that the\ngout grew worse as he got older, and asked for the prince, who had been\nsitting by him just now. Then looking round and seeing that all were a\nlittle constrained in their manner, he glanced in the same direction\nthey did, and exclaimed that there was his poor son and heir lying in\nthe grass!\n\n\"With great lamentation he had the body laid out in state, and called in\nthe court physicians to examine how the prince (for so he persisted in\ncalling the dead monarch) came by his fate. Now, there was no\ndisguising the fact that the deceased had been most foully murdered,\nfor his skull was driven in by the force of the blow; but you see those\nwere dangerous times, and with a despotic king eyeing them all the\nwhile, what could the physicians do? They discovered that there was a\nsmall projecting branch which had been broken off half-way down the tree\nand which had a sharp edge, or splinter, and that this splinter\nprecisely fitted the wound in the head. Without doubt the prince had\nbeen seized with sudden illness, had fallen and struck his head against\nthe splinter. It was ordered that this bough should be at once removed.\nKapchack raised a great lamentation, as he had lost his son and heir,\nand in that character the dead monarch was ceremoniously interred in the\nroyal vaults, which are in the drain the hunted hare took refuge in\nunder the orchard.\n\n\"And so complete was the resemblance the prince bore to his dead parent,\nowing to the loss of his eye and the plucking of his feathers, that for\nthe most part the courtiers actually believed that it really was the\nprince they had buried, and all the common people accepted it without\ndoubt. One or two who hinted at a suspicion when they were alone with\nKapchack the Second received promises of vast rewards to hold their\ntongues; and no sooner had they left his presence than he had them\nassassinated. Thus the dynasty was firmly consolidated, just as the dead\nfounder had desired, though in rather a different manner to what he\nexpected.\n\n\"But the new (or as he appeared the old) king had not been many days on\nthe throne when he remembered the immense treasure of which his parent\nhad been possessed. Sending every one away on one pretext and another,\nhe searched the palace from attic to basement, peeped into all the\ndrawers his father had used, turned over every document, sounded every\nwall, bored holes in the wainscot, ripped up the bark, and covered\nhimself with dust in his furious endeavours to find it. But though he\ndid this twenty times, though he examined every hollow tree within ten\nmiles, and peered into everything, forcing even the owl's ancestor to\nexpose certain skeletons that were in his cupboard, yet could he never\nfind it.\n\n\"And all the while the greatest difficulty he encountered was to hold\nhis tongue; he did not dare let out that he was looking for the\ntreasure, because, of course, everybody thought that he was Kapchack,\nthe same who had put it away. He had to nip his tongue with his beak\ntill it bled to compel himself by sheer pain to abstain from reviling\nhis predecessor. But it was no good, the treasure could not be found. He\ngave out that all this searching was to discover an ancient deed or\ntreaty by which he was entitled to a distant province. As the deed could\nnot be found (having never existed), he marched his army and took the\nprovince by force. And, will you believe it, my friends, the fact is\nthat from that time to this (till the hurricane broke the bough the\nother day) none of the King Kapchacks have had the least idea where\ntheir treasure was. They have lived upon credit.\n\n\"Everybody knew there was a treasure, and as time went on and new\ngenerations arose, it became magnified as the tale was handed down, till\nonly lately, as you know, the whole world considered that Kapchack\npossessed wealth the like of which had never been seen. Thus it happened\nthat as each succeeding Kapchack got farther and farther away from the\nreality and lost all trace of the secret, the fame of these riches\nincreased. But to return. In course of years this Kapchack also found\nhimself growing old, and it became his turn to prepare a son and heir\nfor the throne by pecking out his left eye, and denuding him of his tail\nfeathers. I need not go into further details; suffice it to say the\nthing was managed, and although the old fellows well knew their danger\nand took all sorts of precautions, the princes thus mutilated always\ncontrived to assassinate their parents, and thus that apple-tree has\nbeen the theatre of the most awful series of tragedies the earth has\never known.\n\n\"Down to the last King Kapchack, the thing was always managed\nsuccessfully, and he was the sixth who had kept up the deception. But\nthe number six seems in some way fatal to kings, the sixth always gets\ninto trouble, and Kapchack VI. proved very unfortunate. For in his time,\nas you know, Choo Hoo arose, the kingdom was invaded, and quite half of\nit taken from him. Whether he shrank from the risk attending the\ninitiation of Prince Tchack-tchack (his heir) I do not know, but for\nsome reason or other he put it off from time to time, till the prince in\nfact grew rather too old himself, and too cunning, and getting about\nwith disreputable companions--that gross old villain Kauc, the crow,\nfor one--it is just possible that some inkling of the hereditary\nmutilation in store for him was insinuated (for his own purposes) by\nthat vile wretch.\n\n\"Still, most likely, even if he had known of it he would have come in\ntime to submit (so powerful a motive is ambition) rather than lose the\ncrown, had not it happened that both he and Kapchack fell violently in\nlove with the beautiful young jay, La Schach. Very naturally and very\nexcusably, being so young and so beautiful, she was perhaps just a\nlittle capricious. Jealous to the last degree, old King Kapchack told\nher the secret, and that he really was not nearly so old as the world\nbelieved him to be--he was the sixth of the race, and not the original\nantiquity. No doubt the beauty laughed in her sleeve at him, and just\nfor fun told Tchack-tchack all about it, and that she would never marry\na one-eyed bird. Kapchack, full of jealousy, bethought him that it was\nhigh time to destroy his heir's good looks, so he attempted to peck out\nhis left eye in accordance with the usage of the house.\n\n\"But Tchack-tchack, having now learnt the secret, vain of his beauty,\nand determined to have the lovely jay at any cost, was alive to the\ntrick, and eluded his parent. This was the reason why Tchack-tchack\ntowards the last would never go near the palace. Thus it happened that\nthe hereditary practice was not resorted to, for poor old Kapchack VI.\nfell, as you know, in the very hour of victory. Tchack-tchack, who has\nboth eyes, and the most glossy tail, and a form of the manliest beauty,\nis now at this minute chattering all round the copse in a terrible rage,\nand quite beside himself, because nobody will vote for him to be king,\nespecially since through the breaking of the bough the vaunted treasure\nis at last revealed and found to consist of a diamond locket and one\nsilver spoon--a hollow business you see--so that he has no money, while\nthe beautiful jay has just been united to our friend here--and, goodness\nme, here she comes in a flutter!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE NEW KING.\n\n\nUp came the lovely young bride, full of news, and told them that the\nmost extraordinary thing had just happened.\n\n\"Whatever is it, my love?\" said her husband.\n\n\"Quick, whatever is it?\" said the squirrel.\n\n\"I can't wait,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the hare.\n\n\"Well,\" said the lovely creature--for whom an empire had been thrown\naway--\"while the rook council was deliberating about the punishment to\nbe awarded to Ah Kurroo, the legions, disgusted with the treatment they\nhad received after so wonderful a victory, have risen in revolt,\noverthrown the government, driven the council away, taken the Khan from\nthe tree where he was a prisoner and proclaimed him dictator!\"\n\n\"Extraordinary!\" said the hare; \"the rooks always would have it that\ntheirs was the most perfect form of government ever known.\"\n\n\"No such rebellion was ever heard of before,\" said the squirrel, \"there\nis nothing like it in history; I know, for I've often slipped into the\nowl's muniment room (between you and me) on the sly, and taken a peep\nat his ancient documents. It is most extraordinary!\"\n\n\"I can't see it,\" said the jay; \"I don't agree with you; I am not in the\nleast surprised. I always said they would never get on with so much\ncaw-cawing and talking every evening; I always said----\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" shouted the woodpecker, rushing up breathless with haste,\n\"I am sent round to tell you from the dictator that you can now proceed\nto the election of a king without fear of any kind, for he will keep the\nenemy employed should they appear, and he will over-awe the two\npretenders, Ki Ki and Kauc. Let every one say what he thinks without\ndread, and let there be no bribery and no intimidation. In the name of\nAh Kurroo Khan!\" and away he flew through the copse to make the\nproclamation.\n\nImmediately afterwards the owl, blundering in the daylight, came past\nand said that they had better come on to his house, for he had just had\na private interview with the Khan, and had orders to preside over this\nbusiness. So Bevis and the squirrel, the hare and the two jays proceeded\nto the pollard-tree; there was no need for Bevis to hide now, because he\nwas recognised as a great friend of the squirrel's and the enemy of the\nweasel. A noisy crowd had already collected, which was augmented every\nminute, and there was a good deal of rough pushing and loud talking, not\nunmingled with blows. They were all there (except the weasel), the\ngoldfinch, the tomtit, the chaffinch, the thrush, the blackbird, the\nmissel-thrush, all of them, jays, the alien pigeons, doves,\nwoodpeckers, the rat, the mouse, the stoat, and the fox.\n\nAs the crowd increased, so did the uproar, till the owl appeared at the\nbalcony of his mansion, and the woodpecker called for silence. The owl,\nwhen he could get a hearing, said they were all to give their opinions\nand say who they would have for their king. And that there might be less\nconfusion he would call upon the least of them in size and the youngest\nin age to speak first, and so on upwards to the oldest and biggest.\n\n\"I'm the least,\" cried the wren, coming forward without a moment's\ndelay, \"and I think that, after all I have seen of the ins and outs of\nthe world, I myself should make a very good king.\"\n\n\"Indeed you're not the smallest,\" said Te-te, the tomtit; \"I am the\nsmallest, besides which you are a smuggler. Now I, on the contrary, have\nalready rendered great services to my country, and I am used to official\nlife.\"\n\n\"Yes, you spy,\" cried Tchink, the chaffinch; and all the assembly hissed\nTe-te, till he was obliged to give way, as he could not make himself\nheard.\n\n\"Why not have a queen?\" said the goldfinch. \"I should think you have had\nenough of kings; now, why not have me for queen? I have the richest\ndress of all.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" said the yellow-hammer, \"I wear cloth of gold\nmyself.\"\n\n\"As for that,\" said the woodpecker, \"I myself have no little claim on\nthe score of colour.\"\n\n\"But you have no such azure as me,\" said the kingfisher.\n\n\"Such gaudy hues are in the worst possible taste,\" said the blackbird,\n\"and very vulgar. Now, if I were chosen----\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the thrush, \"well, I never heard anything equal to the\nblackbird's assurance; he who has never held the slightest appointment.\nNow, my relation was ambassador----\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the dove, \"I should be able, if I held the position, to\nconciliate most parties, and make everything smooth.\"\n\n\"You're much too smooth for me,\" said Tchink. \"It's my belief you're\nhand-in-glove with Choo Hoo, for all your tender ways--dear me!\"\n\n\"If experience,\" said Cloctaw, \"if experience is of any value on a\nthrone, I think I myself----\"\n\n\"Experience!\" cried the jay, in high disdain, \"what is he talking of?\nPoor Cloctaw has gone past his prime; however, we must make allowance\nfor his infirmities. You want some one with a decided opinion like\nmyself, ladies and gentlemen!\"\n\n\"If I might speak,\" began one of the alien wood-pigeons, but they\nshouted him down.\n\n\"I don't mean to be left out of this business, I can tell you,\" said the\nmole, suddenly thrusting his snout up through the ground; \"I consider I\nhave been too much overlooked. But no election will be valid without my\nvote. Now, I can tell you that there's not a fellow living who knows\nmore than I do.\"\n\n\"Since the throne is vacant,\" said the mouse, \"why should not I be\nnominated?\"\n\n\"I do not like the way things have been managed,\" said the rat; \"there\nwere too many fine feathers at the court of the late king. Fur must have\na turn now--if I am elected I shall make somebody who wears fur my prime\nminister.\" This was a bold bid for the support of all the four-footed\ncreatures, and was not without its effect.\n\n\"I call that downright bribery,\" said the jay.\n\n\"Listen to me a minute,\" said Sec, the stoat; but as they were now all\ntalking together no one could address the assembly.\n\nAfter a long time Bevis lost all patience, and held up his cannon-stick,\nand threatened to shoot the next one who spoke, which caused a hush.\n\n\"There's one thing _I_ want to say,\" said Bevis, frowning, and looking\nvery severe, as he stamped his foot. \"I have made up my mind on one\npoint. Whoever you have for king you shall not have the weasel, for I\nwill shoot him as dead as a nail the first time I see him.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried everybody at once. \"Hurrah for little Sir Bevis!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Bevis, \"I see the owl wants to speak, and as he's the only\nsensible one among you, just be quiet and hear what he's got to say.\"\n\nAt this the owl, immensely delighted, made Sir Bevis a profound bow, and\nbegged to observe that one thing seemed to have escaped the notice of\nthe ladies and gentlemen whom he saw around him. It was true they were\nall of noble blood, and many of them could claim a descent through\ncountless generations. But they had overlooked the fact that, noble as\nthey were, there was among them one with still higher claims; one who\nhad royal blood in his veins, whose ancestors had been kings, and kings\nof high renown. He alluded to the fox.\n\nAt this the fox, who had not hitherto spoken, and kept rather in the\nbackground, modestly bent his head, and looked the other way.\n\n\"The fox,\" cried Tchink, \"impossible--he's nobody.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Te-te, \"a mere nonentity.\"\n\n\"Quite out of the question,\" said the goldfinch.\n\n\"Out of the running,\" said the hare.\n\n\"Absurd,\" said the jay; and they all raised a clamour, protesting that\neven to mention the fox was to waste the public time.\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" muttered Cloctaw. \"We might do worse; I\nshould not object.\" But his remark was unheeded by all save the fox,\nwhose quick ear caught it.\n\nAgain there was a great clamour and uproar, and not a word could be\nheard, and again Bevis had to lift up his cannon-stick. Just then Ah\nKurroo Khan sent a starling to know if they had finished, because Choo\nHoo had quitted his camp, and his outposts were not a mile off.\n\n\"In that case,\" said the owl, \"our best course will be to stop further\ndiscussion, and to put the matter to the test of the vote at once.\n('Hear, hear.') Do you then all stand off a good way, so that no one\nshall be afraid to do as he chooses, and then come to me one at a time,\nbeginning with the wren (as she spoke first), and let each tell me who\nhe or she votes for, and the reason why, and then I will announce the\nresult.\"\n\nSo they all stood off a good way, except Sir Bevis, who came closer to\nthe pollard to hear what the voters said, and to see that all was done\nfairly. When all was ready the owl beckoned to the wren, and the wren\nflew up and whispered: \"I vote for the fox because Te-te shall not have\nthe crown\".\n\nNext came Te-te, and he said: \"I vote for the fox because the wren shall\nnot have it\".\n\nThen Tchink, who said he voted for the fox so that the goldfinch should\nnot have the throne.\n\nThe goldfinch voted for the fox that the yellow-hammer should not have\nit, and the yellow-hammer because the goldfinch should not succeed. The\njay did the same because Tchack-tchack should not have it; the dove\nbecause the pigeon should not have it; the blackbird to oust the thrush,\nand the thrush to stop the blackbird; the sparrow to stop the starling,\nand the starling to stop the sparrow; the woodpecker to stop the\nkingfisher, and the kingfisher to stop the woodpecker; and so on all\nthrough the list, all voting for the fox in succession, to checkmate\ntheir friends' ambition, down to Cloctaw, who said he voted for the fox\nbecause he knew he could not get the throne himself, and considered the\nfox better than the others. Lastly, the owl, seeing that Reynard had got\nthe election (which indeed he had anticipated when he called attention\nto the modest fox), also voted for him.\n\nThen he called the fox forward, and was about to tell him that he was\nduly elected, and would sit on a throne firmly fixed upon the wide base\nof a universal plebiscite, when Eric, the missel-thrush (who had taken\nno part in the proceedings, for he alone regretted Kapchack), cried out\nthat the fox ought to be asked to show some proof of ability before he\nreceived the crown. This was so reasonable that every one endorsed it;\nand the missel-thrush, seeing that he had made an impression, determined\nto set the fox the hardest task he could think of, and said that as it\nwas the peculiar privilege of a monarch to protect his people, so the\nfox, before he mounted the throne, ought to be called upon to devise\nsome effectual means of repelling the onslaught of Choo Hoo.\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" shouted the assembly, and cried with one voice upon the\nfox to get them out of the difficulty, and save them from the barbarian\nhorde.\n\nThe fox was in the deepest bewilderment, but he carefully concealed his\nperplexity, and looked down upon the ground as if pondering profoundly,\nwhereas he really had not got the least idea what to do. There was\nsilence. Every one waited for the fox.\n\n\"Ahem!\" said Cloctaw, as if clearing his throat.\n\nThe fox detected his meaning, and slyly glanced towards him, when\nCloctaw looked at Bevis and winked. Instantly the fox took the hint\n(afterwards claiming the idea as entirely his own), and lifting his\nhead, said:--\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, you have indeed set me a most difficult task--so\ndifficult, that should I succeed in solving this problem, I hope shall\nobtain your complete confidence. Gentlemen, we have amongst us at this\nmoment a visitor, and one whom we all delight to honour, the more\nespecially as we know him to be the determined foe of that mercenary\nscoundrel the weasel, who, should I be so fortunate as to obtain the\ncrown, shall, I promise you, never set foot in my palace--I allude to\nthe friend of the squirrel and the hare--I allude to Sir Bevis. ('Hear,\nhear! Hurrah for little Sir Bevis! Three cheers more!') I see that you\nrespond with enthusiasm to the sentiment I have expressed. Well, our\nfriend Sir Bevis can, I think, if we call upon him in a respectful and\nproper manner, help us out of this difficulty.\n\n\"He carries in his hand an instrument in which the ignition of certain\nchemical substances causes an alarming report, and projects a shower of\nformidable missiles to a distance. This instrument, which I hear he\nconstructed himself, thereby displaying unparalleled ingenuity, he calls\nhis cannon-stick. Now if we could persuade him to become our ally, and\nto bang off his cannon-stick when Choo Hoo comes, I think we should soon\nsee the enemy in full retreat, when the noble dictator, Ah Kurroo Khan,\ncould pursue, and add another to his already lengthy list of brilliant\nachievements. I would therefore propose, with the utmost humility, that\nSir Bevis be asked to receive a deputation; and I would, with your\npermission, nominate the hare, the squirrel, and Cloctaw as the three\npersons best able to convey your wishes.\"\n\nAt this address there was a general buzz of admiration; people whispered\nto each other that really the fox was extraordinarily clever, and well\nworthy to ascend the throne--who would have thought that any one so\nretiring could have suggested so original, and yet at the same time so\npractical a course? The fox's idea was at once adopted. Bevis went back\nwith the jay to his seat on the moss under the oak, and there sat down\nto receive the deputation.\n\nJust as it was about to set out, the fox begged permission to say one\nword more, which being readily granted, he asked if he might send a\nmessage by the starling to Ah Kurroo Khan. The present, he said, seemed\na most favourable moment for destroying those dangerous pretenders, Ki\nKi and Kauc. Usually their brigand retainers were scattered all over the\ncountry, miles and miles apart, and while thus separated it would\nrequire an immense army--larger than the state in the present exhausted\ncondition of the treasury could afford to pay without fresh taxes--to\nhunt the robbers down in their woods and fastnesses. But they were now\nconcentrated, and preparing no doubt for a raid upon the copse.\n\nNow if Ah Kurroo Khan were asked to fall upon them immediately, he\ncould destroy them in the mass, and overthrow them without difficulty.\nMight he send such a message to the Khan? The assembly applauded the\nfox's foresight, and away flew the starling with the message. Ah Kurroo,\nonly too delighted to have the opportunity of overthrowing his old enemy\nKauc, and his hated rival Ki Ki, immediately gave the order to advance\nto his legions.\n\nMeantime the deputation, consisting of the hare, the squirrel, and\nCloctaw, waited upon Sir Bevis, who received them very courteously upon\nhis seat of moss under the oak. He replied that he would shoot off his\ncannon-stick with the greatest pleasure, if they would show him in which\ndirection they expected Choo Hoo to come. So the hare, the squirrel, and\nCloctaw, with all the crowd following behind, took him to a gap in the\nhedge round the copse on the western side, and pointed out to him the\nway the enemy would come.\n\nIndeed, Sir Bevis had hardly taken his stand and seen to the priming\nthan the van-guard of the barbarians appeared over the tops of the\ntrees. They were pushing on with all speed, for it seems that the\noutposts had reported to the emperor that there was a division in the\ncopse, and that civil war had broken out, being deceived by the attack\ndelivered by Ah Kurroo upon the black pretender Kauc. Up then came the\nmighty host in such vast and threatening numbers that the sun was\ndarkened as it had been on the day of the eclipse, and the crowd behind\nSir Bevis, overwhelmed with fear, could scarce stand their ground. But\nSir Bevis, not one whit daunted, dropped upon one knee, and levelling\nhis cannon-stick upon the other, applied his match. The fire and smoke\nand sound of the report shook the confidence of the front ranks of the\nenemy; they paused and wheeled to the right and left instead of\nadvancing.\n\nIn a minute Bevis had his cannon-stick charged again, and bang it went.\nThe second rank now turned and fell back and threw the host into\nconfusion; still the vast numbers behind pushed blindly on. Bevis, in a\nstate of excitement, now prepared for a grand effort. He filled his\ncannon with powder nearly to the muzzle, he rammed it down tight, and\nfearing lest it might kick and hurt him, he fixed his weapon on the\nstump of an elm which had been thrown some winters since, and whose fall\nhad made the gap in the hedge. Then he cut a long, slender willow stick,\nslit it at one end, and inserted his match in the cleft. He could thus\nstand a long way back out of harm's way and ignite the priming. The\nreport that followed was so loud the very woods rang again, the birds\nfluttered with fear, and even the fox, bold as he was, shrank back from\nsuch a tremendous explosion.\n\nQuite beside themselves with panic fear, the barbarian host turned and\nfled in utter confusion, nor could Choo Hoo, with all his efforts, rally\nthem again, for having once suffered defeat in the battle of the\neclipse, they had lost confidence. Ah Kurroo Khan, just as he had driven\nin the defenders and taken Kauc's camp (though Kauc himself, like the\ncoward he was, escaped before the conflict began), saw the confusion and\nretreat of Choo Hoo's host, and without a moment's delay hurled his\nlegions once more on the retiring barbarians. The greater number fled in\nevery direction, each only trying to save himself; but the best of Choo\nHoo's troops took refuge in their old camp.\n\nAh Kurroo Khan surrounded and invested the camp, but he hesitated to\nstorm it, for he knew that it would entail heavy losses. He prepared to\nblockade Choo Hoo with such strictness that he must eventually surrender\nfrom sheer hunger. He despatched a starling with a message, describing\nthe course he had taken at once to the copse, and the starling, flying\nwith great speed, arrived there in a few minutes. Meanwhile the\nassembly, delighted with the success which had attended Bevis's\ncannonading, crowded round and overwhelmed him with their thanks. Then\nwhen their excitement had somewhat abated, they remembered that the idea\nhad emanated from the fox, and it was resolved to proceed with his\ncoronation at once. Just then the starling arrived from the Khan.\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" said Eric, the missel-thrush, who wanted Tchack-tchack to\nascend the throne of his fathers, \"it is true Choo Hoo is driven back\nand his camp surrounded. But do you bear in mind that Tu Kiu is not in\nit. He, they say, has gone into the west and has already collected a\nlarger host than even Choo Hoo commanded, who are coming up as fast as\nthey can to avenge the Battle of the Eclipse. You must also remember\nthat Sir Bevis cannot be always here with his cannon-stick; he is not\noften here in the morning, and who can tell that some day while he is\naway Tu Kiu may not appear and, while Choo Hoo makes a sortie and\nengages Ah Kurroo's attention, come on here and ravage the whole place,\ndestroy all our stores, and leave us without a berry or an acorn! It\nseems to me that the fox has only got us into a deeper trouble than\never, for if Choo Hoo or Tu Kiu ever does come down upon us, they will\nexact a still worse vengeance for the disgrace they have suffered. The\nfox has only half succeeded; he must devise something more before he can\nclaim our perfect confidence.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" shouted the assembly, \"the missel-thrush is right. The fox\nmust do something more!\"\n\nNow the fox hated the missel-thrush beyond all expression, for just as\nhe was, as it seemed, about to grasp the object of his ambition, the\nmissel-thrush always suggested some new difficulty and delayed his\ntriumph, but he suppressed his temper and said: \"The missel-thrush is a\ntrue patriot, and speaks with a view not to his own interest but to the\ngood of his country. I myself fully admit the truth of his observations;\nChoo Hoo is indeed checked for a time, but there is no knowing how soon\nwe may hear the shout of 'Koos-takke' again. Therefore, gentlemen, I\nwould, with all humility, submit the following suggestion.\n\n\"There can be no doubt but that this invasion has gone on year after\nyear, because the kingdom of Kapchack had become somewhat unwieldy with\nnumerous annexations, and could not be adequately defended. This policy\nof annexation which the late government carried on for so long, bore,\nindeed, upon the surface the false glitter of glory. We heard of\nprovinces and principalities added to the realm, and we forgot the cost.\nThat policy has no doubt weakened the cohesive power of the kingdom: I\nneed not pause here to explain to an audience of the calibre I see\nbefore me the difference between progress and expansion, between\ncolonisation and violent, uncalled-for, and unjust annexation.\n\n\"What I am now about to suggest will at once reduce taxation, fill our\nimpoverished treasury, secure peace, and I believe impart a lasting\nstability to the state. It will enable us one and all to enjoy the\nfruits of the earth. I humbly propose that a treaty be made with Choo\nHoo ('Oh! Oh!' from the missel-thrush and Tchack-tchack), that upon the\npayment of an ample war indemnity--say a million nuts, two million\nacorns, and five million berries, or some trifling figure like that, not\nto be too exorbitant--he be permitted to withdraw ('Shame!' from\nTchack-tchack), and that the provinces torn by force and fraud by the\nlate government from their lawful owners be restored to them ('Which\nmeans,' said the missel-thrush, 'that as the lawful owners are not\nstrong enough to protect themselves, Choo Hoo may plunder half the world\nas he likes'), and that peace be proclaimed. I, for my part, would far\nrather--if I be so fortunate as to be your king--I say I would far\nrather rule over a contented and prosperous people than over an empire\nin which the sword is never in the scabbard!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" shouted the assembly. \"We have certainly selected the\nright person: this is truly wisdom. Let the treaty be concluded; and\nwhat a feast we will have upon the war indemnity,\" they said to one\nanother.\n\n\"It is selling our honour--making a bargain and a market of our\nancestors' courage,\" said the missel-thrush.\n\n\"It is a vile infringement of my right,\" said Tchack-tchack; \"I am\nrobbed of my inheritance, and the people of theirs, under a false\npretext and sham. The country will be ruined.\"\n\n\"Begone,\" shouted the crowd, \"begone, you despicable wretches,\" and away\nflew the missel-thrush and Tchack-tchack in utter disgust and despair.\n\nSo soon as they had gone the assembly proceeded to appoint a Commission\nto negotiate the treaty of peace. It consisted of the woodpecker, the\nthrush, and Cloctaw: the stoat muttered a good deal, for having been\nalmost the only adherent of the fox in his former lowly condition, he\nexpected profitable employment now his friend had obtained such dignity.\nThe fox, however, called him aside and whispered something which\nsatisfied him, and the Commission having received instructions proceeded\nat once to Ah Kurroo, who was to furnish them with a flag of truce. A\ncompany of starlings went with them to act as couriers and carry\nintelligence. When the Commission reached Ah Kurroo, he declined to\nopen a truce with Choo Hoo, even for a moment, and presently, as the\nCommission solemnly demanded obedience in the name of the fox, he\ndecided to go himself to the king-elect and explain the reasons--of a\npurely military character--which led him to place this obstruction in\ntheir way.\n\nThe fox received Ah Kurroo with demonstrations of the deepest respect,\ncongratulated him upon his achievements, and admired the disposition he\nhad made of his forces so as to completely blockade the enemy. Ah\nKurroo, much pleased with this reception, and the appreciation of his\nservices, pointed out that Choo Hoo was now so entirely in his power,\nthat in a few days he would have to surrender, as provisions were\nfailing him. Long ere Tu Kiu could return with the relieving column the\nemperor would be a captive. Ah Kurroo begged the fox not to throw away\nthis glorious opportunity.\n\nThe king-elect, who had his own reasons for not desiring the Khan to\nappear too victorious, listened attentively, but pointed out that it was\nnot so much himself, but the nation which demanded instant peace.\n\n\"Moreover,\" said he in a whisper to the Khan, \"don't you see, my dear\ngeneral, that if you totally destroy Choo Hoo your occupation will be\ngone; we shall not require an army or a general. Now as it is my\nintention to appoint you commander-in-chief for life----\"\n\n\"Say no more,\" said Ah Kurroo, \"say no more;\" then aloud: \"Your royal\nhighness' commands shall be immediately obeyed;\" and away he flew, and\ngave the Commission the flag of truce.\n\nChoo Hoo, confined in his camp with a murmuring and mutinous soldiery,\nshort of provisions, and expecting every moment to see the enemy pouring\ninto his midst, was beyond measure delighted when he heard that peace\nwas proposed, indeed he could scarcely believe that any one in his\nsenses could offer such a thing to an army which must inevitably\nsurrender in a few hours. But when he heard that the fox was the\nking-elect, he began to comprehend, for there were not wanting\nsuspicions that it was the fox who, when Choo Hoo was only a nameless\nadventurer, assisted him with advice.\n\nThe Commission, therefore, found their task easy enough so far as the\nmain point was concerned, that there should be peace, but when they came\nto discuss the conditions it became a different matter. The fox, a born\ndiplomat, had instructed them to put forward the hardest conditions\nfirst, and if they could not force these upon Choo Hoo to gradually\nslacken them, little by little, till they overcame his reluctance. At\nevery step they sent couriers to the king-elect with precise information\nof their progress.\n\nThe negotiations lasted a very long time, quite an hour, during which\nthe couriers flew incessantly to and fro, and Bevis, lying on his back\non the moss under the oak, tried which could screech the loudest,\nhimself or the jay. Bevis would easily have won had he been able to\nresist the inclination to pull the jay's tail, which made the latter\nset up such a yell that everybody started, Bevis shouted with laughter,\nand even the fox lost his gravity.\n\nChoo Hoo agreed to everything without much difficulty, except the\nindemnity; he drew back at that, declaring it was too many millions, and\nthere was even some danger of the negotiations being broken off. But the\nfox was equally firm, he insisted on it, and even added 10,000 bushels\nof grain to the original demand, at which Choo Hoo nearly choked with\nindignation. The object of the fox in requiring the grain was to secure\nthe faithful allegiance of all his lesser subjects, as the sparrows, and\nindeed he regarded the indemnity as the most certain means of beginning\nhis reign at the height of popularity, since it would be distributed\namong the nation. People could not, moreover, fail to remark the extreme\ndisinterestedness of the king, since of all these millions of berries,\nacorns, nuts, grain, and so forth, there was not one single mouthful for\nhimself. Choo Hoo, as said before, full of indignation, abruptly turned\naway from the Commission, and, at a loss what to do, they communicated\nwith the fox.\n\nHe ordered them to inform Choo Hoo that under certain restrictions\ntravellers would in future be permitted access to the spring in the\ncopse which did not freeze in winter. The besieged emperor somewhat\nrelaxed the austerity of his demeanour at this; another pourparler took\nplace, in the midst of which the fox told the Commission to mention (as\nif casually) that among others there would be a clause restoring\nindependence to all those princes and archdukes whose domains the late\nKapchack had annexed. Choo Hoo could scarce maintain decorum when he\nheard this; he could have shouted with delight, for he saw in a moment\nthat it was equivalent to ceding half Kapchack's kingdom, since these\nsmall Powers would never be able to defend themselves against his hosts.\n\nAt the same moment, too, he was called aside, and informed that a\nprivate messenger had arrived from the fox: it was the humble-bee, who\nhad slipped easily through the lines and conveyed a strong hint from the\nking-elect. The fox said he had done the best he could for his brother,\nthe emperor, remembering their former acquaintance; now let the emperor\ndo his part, and between them they could rule the earth with ease. Choo\nHoo, having told the humble-bee that he quite understood, and that he\nagreed to the fox's offer, dismissed him, and returned to the\nCommission, whose labours were now coming to a close.\n\nAll the clauses having been agreed to, Ess, the owl, as the most\npractised in such matters, was appointed by the fox to draw up the\ndocument in proper form for signature. While this was being done, the\nking-elect proceeded to appoint his Cabinet: Sec, the stoat, was\nnominated treasurer; Ah Kurroo Khan, commander-in-chief for life; Ess,\nthe owl, continued chief secretary of state; Cloctaw was to be grand\nchamberlain; Raoul, the rat, lieutenant-governor of the coast (along the\nbrook and Long Pond), and so on.\n\nNext the weasel, having failed to present himself when summoned by the\nwoodpecker, was attainted as contumacious, and sentenced, with the\nentire approval of the assembly, to lose all his dignities and estates;\nhis woods, parks, forests, and all his property were escheated to the\nCrown, and were by the king handed over to his faithful follower Sec.\nThe weasel (whose whereabouts could not be discovered) was also\nproclaimed an outlaw, whom any one might slay without fear of trial. It\nwas then announced that all others who absented themselves from the\ncourt, and were not present when the treaty was signed, would be treated\nas traitors, and receive the same punishment as the weasel.\n\nImmediately he heard this, Yiwy, son and heir of Ki Ki, the hawk, who\nhad fled, came and paid homage to the fox, first to save the estates\nfrom confiscation, and secondly that he might enjoy them in his father's\nplace. Ki Ki was accordingly declared an outlaw. Directly afterwards,\nKauc, the crow, crept in, much crestfallen, and craved pardon, hoping to\nsave his property. The assembly received him with hisses and hoots:\nstill the fox kept his word, and permitted him to retain his estates\nupon payment of an indemnity for the cost of the troops employed against\nhim under Ah Kurroo, of 100,000 acorns. Kauc protested that he should be\nruined: but the crowd would not hear him, and he was obliged to submit.\n\nThen Eric, the missel-thrush, and Prince Tchack-tchack flew up: the\nprince had yielded to good advice, and resolved to smother his\nresentment in order to enjoy the immense private domains of his late\nparent. The protocols were now ready, and the fox had already taken the\ndocument to sign, when there was a rush of wings, and in came six or\nseven of those princes and archdukes--among them the archduke of the\npeewits--to whom independence was to be restored. They loudly proclaimed\ntheir loyalty, and begged not to be cast off: declaring that they were\nquite unable to defend themselves, and should be mercilessly plundered\nby the barbarian horde. The fox lifted his paw in amazement that there\nshould exist on the face of the earth any such poltroons as this, who\npreferred to pay tribute and enjoy peace rather than endure the labour\nof defending their own independence. The whole assembly cried shame upon\nthem, but the princes persisted, and filled the court with their\nlamentations, till at a sign from the king they were hustled out of the\ncopse.\n\nThe treaty itself filled so many pages of parchment that no one\nattempted to read it, the owl certifying that it was all correct: an\nextract, however, divested of technical expressions, was handed about\nthe court, and was to the following effect:--\n\n\nThe Treaty of Windflower Copse.\n\n1. The high contracting parties to this treaty are and shall be, on the\none side, King Reynard CI., and on the other side, Choo Hoo the emperor.\n\n2. It is declared that Kapchack being dead honour is satisfied, and\nfurther fighting superfluous.\n\n3. Choo Hoo agrees to pay a war indemnity of one million nuts, two\nmillion acorns, five million berries, and ten thousand bushels of grain,\nin ten equal instalments, the first instalment the day of the full moon\nnext before Christmas, and the remainder at intervals of a fortnight.\n\n4. The spring in the copse, which does not freeze in winter, is declared\nfree and open to all travellers, not exceeding fifty in number.\n\n5. The copse itself is hereby declared a neutral zone, wherein all\ncouncils, pourparlers, parliaments, commissions, markets, fairs,\nmeetings, courts of justice, and one and all and every such assembly for\npublic or private purposes, may be and shall be held, without let or\nhindrance, saving only:--(_a_) Plots against His Majesty King Reynard\nCI.; (_b_) plots against His Imperial Majesty Choo Hoo.\n\n6. The unjust annexations of the late King Kapchack are hereby\nrepudiated, and all the provinces declared independent.\n\n7. Lastly, peace is proclaimed for ever and a day, beginning to-morrow.\n\n(Signed)\nHis Majesty King Reynard CI.\nHis Imperial Majesty the Emperor Choo Hoo.\nB. (for Sir Bevis).\nSec, the stoat (Treasurer).\nAh Kurroo Khan (Commander-in-Chief).\nEss, the owl (Chief Secretary of State).\nCloctaw, the jackdaw (Grand Chamberlain).\nRaoul, the rat (Lieutenant-Governor of the Coasts).\nPhu, the starling.\nTchink, the chaffinch.\nTe-te, the tomtit.\nUlu, the hare.\nEric, the missel-thrush.\nTchack-tchack, the magpie, etc., etc., etc.\n\n\nEvery one in fact signed it but the weasel, who was still lying sullenly\n_perdu_. The B. was for Bevis; the fox, who excelled in the art of\npaying delicate compliments, insisted upon Bevis signing next to the\nhigh contracting parties. So taking the quill, Bevis printed a good big\nB, a little staggering, but plain and legible. Directly this business\nwas concluded, Ah Kurroo withdrew his legions; Choo Hoo sallied forth\nfrom the camp, and returning the way he had come, in about an hour was\nmet by his son Tu Kiu at the head of enormous reinforcements. Delighted\nat the treaty, and the impunity they now enjoyed, the vast barbarian\nhorde, divided into foraging parties of from one hundred to a thousand,\nspread over a tract of country thirty miles wide, rolled like a\ndevastating tidal wave in resistless course southwards, driving the\nindependent princes before them, plundering, ravaging, and destroying,\nand leaving famine behind. Part of the plunder indeed, of the provinces\nrecently attached to Kapchack's kingdom, and now declared independent,\nfurnished the first instalment of the war indemnity the barbarians had\nengaged to pay.\n\nMeantime, in the copse, preparations were made for the coronation of\nthe king, who had assumed, in accordance with well-known precedents,\nthat all his ancestors, whether acknowledged or not, had reigned, and\ncalled himself King Reynard the Hundred and First. The procession having\nbeen formed, and all the ceremonies completed, Bevis banged off his\ncannon-stick as a salute, and the fox, taking the crown, proceeded to\nput it on his head, remarking as he did so that thus they might see how\nwhen rogues fall out honest folk come by their own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. SIR BEVIS AND THE WIND.\n\n\nSome two or three days after peace was concluded, it happened that one\nmorning the waggon was going up on the hills to bring down a load of\nstraw, purchased from the very old gentleman who in his anger shot King\nKapchack. When Bevis saw the horses brought out of the stable, and\nlearnt that they were to travel along the road that led towards the\nships (though but three miles out of the sixty), nothing would do but he\nmust go with them. As his papa and the bailiff were on this particular\noccasion to accompany the waggon, Bevis had his own way as usual.\n\nThe road passed not far from the copse, and Bevis heard the woodpecker\nsay something, but he was too busy touching up the horses with the\ncarter's long whip to pay any heed. If he had been permitted he would\nhave lashed them into a sharp trot. Every now and then Bevis turned\nround to give the bailiff a sly flick with the whip; the bailiff sat at\nthe tail and dangled his legs over behind, so that his broad back was a\ncapital thing to hit. By-and-by, the carter left the highway and took\nthe waggon along a lane where the ruts were white with chalk, and which\nwound round at the foot of the downs. Then after surmounting a steep\nhill, where the lane had worn a deep hollow, they found a plain with\nhills all round it, and here, close to the sward, was the straw-rick\nfrom which they were to load.\n\nBevis insisted upon building the load, that is putting the straw in its\nplace when it was thrown up; but in three minutes he said he hated it,\nit was so hot and scratchy, so out he jumped. Then he ran a little way\nup the green sward of the hill, and lying down rolled over and over to\nthe bottom. Next he wandered along the low hedge dividing the stubble\nfrom the sward, so low that he could jump over it, but as he could not\nfind anything he came back, and at last so teased and worried his papa\nto let him go up to the top of the hill, that he consented, on Bevis\npromising in the most solemn manner that he would not go one single inch\nbeyond the summit, where there was an ancient earthwork. Bevis promised,\nand his eyes looked so clear and truthful, and his cheek so rosy and\ninnocent, and his lips so red and pouting, that no one could choose but\nbelieve him.\n\nAway he ran thirty yards up the hill at a burst, but it soon became so\nsteep he had to stay and climb slowly. Five minutes afterwards he began\nto find it very hard work indeed, though it looked so easy from below,\nand stopped to rest. He turned round and looked down; he could see over\nthe waggon and the straw-rick, over the ash-trees in the hedges, over\nthe plain (all yellow with stubble) across to the hills on the other\nside, and there, through a gap in them, it seemed as if the land\nsuddenly ceased, or dropped down, and beyond was a dark blue expanse\nwhich ended in the sky where the sky came down to touch it.\n\nBy his feet was a rounded boulder-stone, brown and smooth, a hard\nsarsen; this he tried to move, but it was so heavy that he could but\njust stir it. But the more difficult a thing was, or the more he was\nresisted, the more determined Bevis always became. He would stamp and\nshout with rage, rather than let a thing alone quietly. When he did this\nsometimes Pan, the spaniel, would look at him in amazement, and wonder\nwhy he did not leave it and go on and do something else, as the world\nwas so big, and there were very many easy things that could be done\nwithout any trouble. That was not Bevis's idea, however, at all; he\nnever quitted a thing till he had done it. And so he tugged and strained\nand struggled with the stone till he got it out of its bed and on the\nsloping sward.\n\nThen he pushed and heaved at it, till it began to roll, and giving it a\nfinal thrust with his foot, away it went, at first rumbling and rolling\nslowly, and then faster and with a thumping, till presently it bounded\nand leaped ten yards at a time, and at the bottom of the hill sprang\nover the hedge like a hunter, and did not stop till it had gone twenty\nyards out into the stubble towards the straw-rick. Bevis laughed and\nshouted, though a little disappointed that it had not smashed the\nwaggon, or at least jumped over it. Then, waving his hat, away he went\nagain, now picking up a flint to fling as far down as he could, now\nkicking over a white round puff ball--always up, up, till he grew hot,\nand his breath came in quick deep pants.\n\nBut still as determined as ever, he pushed on, and presently stood on\nthe summit, on the edge of the fosse. He looked down; the waggon seemed\nunder his feet; the plain, the hills beyond, the blue distant valley on\none side, on the other the ridge he had mounted stretched away, and\nbeyond it still more ridges, till he could see no further. He went into\nthe fosse, and there it seemed so pleasant that he sat down, and in a\nminute lay extended at full length in his favourite position, looking up\nat the sky. It was much more blue than he had ever seen it before, and\nit seemed only just over his head; the grasshoppers called in the grass\nat his side, and he could hear a lark sing, singing far away, but on a\nlevel with him. First he thought he would talk to the grasshopper, or\ncall to one of the swallows, but he had now got over the effort of\nclimbing, and he could not sit still.\n\nUp he jumped, ran up the rampart, and then down again into the fosse. He\nliked the trench best, and ran along it in the hollow, picking up stray\nflints and throwing them as far as he could. The trench wound round the\nhill, and presently when he saw a low hawthorn-bush just outside the\nbroad green ditch, and scrambled up to it, the waggon was gone and the\nplain, for he had reached the other side of the camp. There the top of\nthe hill was level and broad: a beautiful place for a walk.\n\nBevis went a little way out upon it, and the turf was so soft, and\nseemed to push up his foot so, that he must go on, and when he had got a\nlittle farther, he heard another grasshopper, and thought he would run\nand catch him; but the grasshopper, who had heard of his tricks, stopped\nsinging, and hid in a bunch, so that Bevis could not see him.\n\nNext he saw a little round hill--a curious little hill--not very much\nhigher than his own head, green with grass and smooth. This curious\nlittle hill greatly pleased him; he would have liked to have had it\ncarried down into his garden at home; he ran up on the top of it, and\nshouted at the sun, and danced round on the tumulus. A third grasshopper\ncalled in the grass, and Bevis ran down after him, but he, too, was too\ncunning; then a glossy ball of thistledown came up so silently, Bevis\ndid not see it till it touched him, and lingered a moment lovingly\nagainst his shoulder. Before he could grasp it, it was gone.\n\nA few steps farther and he found a track crossing the hill, waggon-ruts\nin the turf, and ran along it a little way--only a little way, for he\ndid not care for anything straight. Next he saw a mushroom, and gathered\nit, and while hunting about hither and thither for another, came upon\nsome boulder-stones, like the one he had hurled down the slope, but very\nmuch larger, big enough to play hide-and-seek behind. He danced round\nthese--Bevis could not walk--and after he had danced round every one,\nand peered under and climbed over one or two, he discovered that they\nwere put in a circle.\n\n\"Somebody's been at play here,\" thought Bevis, and looking round to see\nwho had been placing the stones in a ring, he saw a flock of rooks far\noff in the air, even higher up than he was on the hill, wheeling about,\nsoaring round with outspread wings and cawing. They slipped past each\nother in and out, tracing a maze, and rose up, drifting away slowly as\nthey rose; they were so happy, they danced in the sky. Bevis ran along\nthe hill in the same direction they were going, shouting and waving his\nhand to them, and they cawed to him in return.\n\nWhen he looked to see where he was he was now in the midst of long\nmounds or heaps of flints that had been dug and stacked; he jumped on\nthem, and off again, picked up the best for throwing, and flung them as\nfar as he could. There was a fir-copse but a little distance farther, he\nwent to it, but the trees grew so close together he could not go\nthrough, so he walked round it, and then the ground declined so gently\nhe did not notice he was going downhill. At the bottom there was a wood\nof the strangest old twisted oaks he had ever seen; not the least like\nthe oak-trees by his house at home that he knew so well.\n\nThese were short, and so very knotty that even the trunks, thick as they\nwere, seemed all knots, and the limbs were gnarled, and shaggy with grey\nlichen. He threw pieces of dead stick, which he found on the ground, up\nat the acorns, but they were not yet ripe, so he wandered on among the\noaks, tapping every one he passed to see which was hollow, till\npresently he had gone so far he could not see the hills for the boughs.\n\nBut just as he was thinking he would ask a bee to show him the way out\n(for there was not a single bird in the wood), he came to a place where\nthe oaks were thinner, and the space between them was covered with\nbramble-bushes. Some of the blackberries were ripe, and his lips were\nsoon stained with their juice. Passing on from bramble-thicket to\nbramble-thicket, by-and-by he shouted, and danced, and clapped his hands\nwith joy, for there were some nuts on a hazel bough, and they were ripe\nhe was sure, for the side towards the sun was rosy. He knew that nuts do\nnot get brown first, but often turn red towards the south. Out came his\npocket-knife, and with seven tremendous slashes, for Bevis could not do\nanything steadily, off came a branch with a crook. He crooked down the\nbough and gathered the nuts, there were eight on that bough, and on the\nnext four, and on the next only two. But there was another stole beyond,\nfrom which, in a minute, he had twenty more, and then as he could not\nstay to crack them, he crammed them into his pocket and ceased to\nreckon.\n\n\"I will take fifty up to the squirrel,\" he said to himself, \"and the\nnut-crackers, and show him how to do it properly with some salt.\" So he\ntugged at the boughs, and dragged them down, and went on from stole to\nstole till he had roamed into the depths of the nut-tree wood.\n\nThen, as he stopped a second to step over a little streamlet that oozed\nalong at his feet, all at once he became aware how still it was. No\nbirds sang, and no jay called; no woodpecker chuckled; there was not\neven a robin; nor had he seen a rabbit, or a squirrel, or a dragon-fly,\nor any of his friends. Already the outer rim of some of the hazel leaves\nwas brown, while the centre of the leaf remained green, but there was\nnot even the rustle of a leaf as it fell. The larks were not here, nor\nthe swallows, nor the rooks; the streamlet at his feet went on without a\nmurmur; and the breeze did not come down into the hollow. Except for a\nbee, whose buzz seemed quite loud as he flew by, there was not a moving\nthing. Bevis was alone; he had never before been so utterly alone, and\nhe stopped humming the old tune the brook had taught him, to listen.\n\nHe lifted his crook and struck the water; it splashed, but in a second\nit was still again. He flung a dead branch into a tree; it cracked as it\nhit a bough, on which the leaves rustled; then it fell thump, and lay\nstill and quiet. He stamped on the ground, the grass gave no sound. He\nshouted \"Holloa!\" but there was no echo. His voice seemed to slip away\nfrom him, he could not shout so loud as he had been accustomed to. For a\nminute he liked it; then he began to think it was not so pleasant; then\nhe wanted to get out, but he could not see the hill, so he did not know\nwhich way to go.\n\nSo he stroked a knotted oak with his hand, smoothing it down, and said:\n\"Oak, oak, tell me which way to go!\" and the oak tried to speak, but\nthere was no wind, and he could not, but he dropped just one leaf on\nthe right side, and Bevis picked it up, and as he did so, a nut-tree\nbough brushed his cheek.\n\nHe kissed the bough, and said: \"Nut-tree bough, nut-tree bough, tell me\nthe way to go!\" The bough could not speak for the same reason that the\noak could not; but it bent down towards the streamlet. Bevis dropped on\none knee and lifted up a little water in the hollow of his hand, and\ndrank it, and asked which way to go.\n\nThe stream could not speak because there was no stone to splash against,\nbut it sparkled in the sunshine (as Bevis had pushed the bough aside),\nand looked so pleasant that he followed it a little way, and then he\ncame to an open place with twisted old oaks, gnarled and knotted, where\na blue butterfly was playing.\n\n\"Show me the way out, you beautiful creature,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"So I will, Bevis dear,\" said the butterfly. \"I have just come from your\nwaggon, and your papa and the bailiff have been calling to you, and I\nthink they will soon be coming back to look for you. Follow me, my\ndarling.\"\n\nSo Bevis followed the little blue butterfly, who danced along as\nstraight as it was possible for him to go, for he, like Bevis, did not\nlike too much straightness. Now the oak knew the butterfly was there,\nand that was why he dropped his leaf; and so did the nut-tree bough, and\nthat was why he drooped and let the sun sparkle on the water, and the\nstream smiled to make Bevis follow him to where the butterfly was\nplaying. Without pausing anywhere, but just zig-zagging on, the blue\nbutterfly floated before Bevis, who danced after him, the nuts falling\nfrom his crammed pockets; knocking every oak as he went with his stick,\nasking them if they knew anything, or had anything to tell the people in\nthe copse near his house. The oaks were bursting with things to tell\nhim, and messages to send, but they could not speak, as there was no\nbreeze in the hollow. He whipped the bramble bushes with his crook, but\nthey did not mind in the least, they were so glad to see him.\n\nHe whistled to the butterfly to stop a moment while he picked a\nblackberry; the butterfly settled on a leaf. Then away they went again\ntogether till they left the wood behind and began to go up the hill.\nThere the butterfly grew restless, and could scarce restrain his pace\nfor Bevis to keep up, as they were now in the sunshine. Bevis raced\nafter as fast as he could go uphill, but at the top the butterfly\nthought he saw a friend of his, and telling Bevis that somebody would\ncome to him in a minute, away he flew. Bevis looked round, but it was\nall strange and new to him; there were hills all round, but there was no\nwaggon, and no old trench or rampart; nothing but the blue sky and the\ngreat sun, which did not seem far off.\n\nWhile he wondered which way to go, the wind came along the ridge, and\ntaking him softly by the ear pushed him gently forward and said: \"Bevis,\nmy love, I have been waiting for you ever so long; why did you not come\nbefore?\"\n\n\"Because you never asked me,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"Oh yes, I did; I asked you twenty times in the copse. I beckoned to you\nout of the great oak, under which you went to sleep; and I whispered to\nyou from the fir-trees where the squirrel played, but you were so busy,\ndear, so busy with Kapchack, and the war, and Choo Hoo, and the court,\nand all the turmoil, that you did not hear me.\"\n\n\"You should have called louder,\" said Bevis.\n\n\"So I did,\" said the wind. \"Don't you remember I whirled the little\nbough against your window, and rattled the casement that night you saw\nthe owl go by?\"\n\n\"I was so sleepy,\" said Bevis, \"I did not know what you meant; you\nshould have kissed me.\"\n\n\"So I did,\" said the wind. \"I kissed you a hundred times out in the\nfield, and stroked your hair, but you would not take any notice.\"\n\n\"I had so much to do,\" said Bevis; \"there was the weasel and my\ncannon-stick.\"\n\n\"But I wanted you very much,\" said the wind, \"because I love you, and\nlonged for you to come and visit me.\"\n\n\"Well, now I am come,\" said Bevis. \"But where do you live?\"\n\n\"This is where I live, dear,\" said the wind. \"I live upon the hill;\nsometimes I go to the sea, and sometimes to the woods, and sometimes I\nrun through the valley, but I always come back here, and you may always\nbe sure of finding me here; and I want you to come and romp with me.\"\n\n\"I will come,\" said Bevis; \"I like a romp, but are you very rough?\"\n\n\"Oh no, dear; not with you.\"\n\n\"I am a great big boy,\" said Bevis; \"I am eating my peck of salt very\nfast: I shall soon get too big to romp with you. How old are you, you\njolly Wind?\"\n\nThe wind laughed and said: \"I am older than all the very old things. I\nam as old as the brook.\"\n\n\"But the brook is very old,\" said Bevis. \"He told me he was older than\nthe hills, so I do not think you are as old as he is.\"\n\n\"Yes I am,\" said the wind; \"he was always my playfellow; we were\nchildren together.\"\n\n\"If you are so very, very old,\" said Bevis, \"it is no use your trying to\nromp with me, because I am very strong; I can carry my papa's gun on my\nshoulder, and I can run very fast; do you know the stupid old bailiff\ncan't catch me? I can go round the ricks ever so much quicker than he\ncan.\"\n\n\"I can run quick,\" said the wind.\n\n\"But not so quick as me,\" said Bevis; \"now see if you can catch me.\"\n\nAway he ran, and for a moment he left the wind behind; but the wind blew\na little faster, and overtook him, and they raced along together, like\ntwo wild things, till Bevis began to pant. Then down he sat on the turf\nand kicked up his heels and shouted, and the wind fanned his cheek and\ncooled him, and kissed his lips and stroked his hair, and caressed him\nand played with him, till up he jumped again and danced along, the wind\nalways pushing him gently.\n\n\"You are a jolly old Wind,\" said Bevis, \"I like you very much; but you\nmust tell me a story, else we shall quarrel. I'm sure we shall.\"\n\n\"I will try,\" said the wind; \"but I have forgotten all my stories,\nbecause the people never come to listen to me now.\"\n\n\"Why don't they come?\" said Bevis.\n\n\"They are too busy,\" said the wind, sighing; \"they are so very, very\nbusy, just like you were with Kapchack and his treasure and the war, and\nall the rest of the business; they have so much to do, they have quite\nforsaken me.\"\n\n\"I will come to you,\" said Bevis; \"do not be sorry. I will come and play\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the wind; \"and drink me, dear, as much as ever you can.\nI shall make you strong. Now drink me.\"\n\nBevis stood still and drew in a long, long breath, drinking the wind\ntill his chest was full and his heart beat quicker. Then he jumped and\ndanced and shouted.\n\n\"There,\" said the wind, \"see, how jolly I have made you. It was I who\nmade you dance and sing, and run along the hill just now. Come up here,\nmy darling Sir Bevis, and drink me as often as ever you can, and the\nmore you drink of me the happier you will be, and the longer you will\nlive. And people will look at you and say: 'How jolly he looks! Is he\nnot nice? I wish I was like him.' And presently they will say: 'Where\ndoes he learn all these things?'\n\n\"For you must know, Bevis, my dear, that although I have forgotten my\nstories, yet they are all still there in my mind, and by-and-by, if you\nkeep on drinking me I shall tell you all of them, and nobody will know\nhow you learn it all. For I know more than the brook, because, you see,\nI travel about everywhere: and I know more than the trees; indeed, all\nthey know I taught them myself. The sun is always telling me everything,\nand the stars whisper to me at night: the ocean roars at me: the earth\nwhispers to me: just you lie down, Bevis love, upon the ground and\nlisten.\"\n\nSo Bevis lay down on the grass, and heard the wind whispering in the\ntufts and bunches, and the earth under him answered, and asked the wind\nto stay and talk. But the wind said: \"I have got Bevis to-day: come on,\nBevis,\" and Bevis stood up and walked along.\n\n\"Besides all these things,\" said the wind, \"I can remember everything\nthat ever was. There never was anything that I cannot remember, and my\nmind is so clear that if you will but come up here and drink me, you\nwill understand everything.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Bevis, \"I will drink you--there, I have just had such\na lot of you: now tell me this instant why the sun is up there, and is\nhe very hot if you touch him, and which way does he go when he sinks\nbeyond the wood, and who lives up there, and are they nice people, and\nwho painted the sky?\"\n\nThe wind laughed aloud, and said: \"Bevis, my darling, you have not drunk\nhalf enough of me yet, else you would never ask such silly questions as\nthat. Why, those are like the silly questions the people ask who live in\nthe houses of the cities, and never feel me or taste me, or speak to me.\nAnd I have seen them looking through long tubes----\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Bevis; \"they are telescopes, and you look at the sun and\nthe stars, and they tell you all about them.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the wind, \"don't you believe such stuff and rubbish, my\npet. How can they know anything about the sun who are never out in the\nsunshine, and never come up on the hills, or go into the wood? How can\nthey know anything about the stars who never stopped on the hills, or on\nthe sea all night? How can they know anything of such things who are\nshut up in houses, dear, where I cannot come in?\n\n\"Bevis, my love, if you want to know all about the sun, and the stars,\nand everything, make haste and come to me, and I will tell you, dear. In\nthe morning, dear, get up as quick as you can, and drink me as I come\ndown from the hill. In the day go up on the hill, dear, and drink me\nagain, and stay there if you can till the stars shine out, and drink\nstill more of me.\n\n\"And by-and-by you will understand all about the sun, and the moon, and\nthe stars, and the earth which is so beautiful, Bevis. It is so\nbeautiful, you can hardly believe how beautiful it is. Do not listen,\ndear, not for one moment, to the stuff and rubbish they tell you down\nthere in the houses where they will not let me come. If they say the\nearth is not beautiful, tell them they do not speak the truth. But it is\nnot their fault, for they have never seen it, and as they have never\ndrank me their eyes are closed, and their ears shut up tight. But every\nevening, dear, before you get into bed, do you go to your window--the\nsame as you did the evening the owl went by--and lift the curtain and\nlook up at the sky, and I shall be somewhere about, or else I shall be\nquiet in order that there may be no clouds, so that you may see the\nstars. In the morning, as I said before, rush out and drink me up.\n\n\"The more you drink of me, the more you will want, and the more I shall\nlove you. Come up to me upon the hills, and your heart will never be\nheavy, but your eyes will be bright, and your step quick, and you will\nsing and shout----\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Bevis, \"I will shout. Holloa!\" and he ran up on to the\ntop of the little round hill, to which they had now returned, and danced\nabout on it as wild as could be.\n\n\"Dance away, dear,\" said the wind, much delighted. \"Everybody dances who\ndrinks me. The man in the hill there----\"\n\n\"What man?\" said Bevis, \"and how did he get in the hill? just tell him I\nwant to speak to him.\"\n\n\"Darling,\" said the wind, very quiet and softly, \"he is dead, and he is\nin the little hill you are standing on, under your feet. At least, he\nwas there once, but there is nothing of him there now. Still it is his\nplace, and as he loved me, and I loved him, I come very often and sing\nhere.\"\n\n\"When did he die?\" said Bevis. \"Did I ever see him?\"\n\n\"He died about a minute ago, dear; just before you came up the hill. If\nyou were to ask the people who live in the houses, where they will not\nlet me in (they carefully shut out the sun too), they would tell you he\ndied thousands of years ago; but they are foolish, very foolish. It was\nhardly so long ago as yesterday. Did not the brook tell you all about\nthat?\n\n\"Now this man, and all his people, used to love me and drink me, as much\nas ever they could all day long and a great part of the night, and when\nthey died they still wanted to be with me, and so they were all buried\non the tops of the hills, and you will find these curious little mounds\neverywhere on the ridges, dear, where I blow along. There I come to them\nstill, and sing through the long dry grass, and rush over the turf, and\nI bring the scent of the clover from the plain, and the bees come\nhumming along upon me. The sun comes too, and the rain. But I am here\nmost; the sun only shines by day, and the rain only comes now and then.\n\n\"But I am always here, day and night, winter and summer. Drink me as\nmuch as you will, you cannot drink me away; there is always just as much\nof me left. As I told you, the people who were buried in these little\nmounds used to drink me, and oh! how they raced along the turf, dear;\nthere is nobody can run so fast now; and they leaped and danced, and\nsang and shouted. I loved them as I love you, my darling; there, sit\ndown and rest on the thyme, dear, and I will stroke your hair and sing\nto you.\"\n\nSo Bevis sat down on the thyme, and the wind began to sing, so low and\nsweet and so strange an old song, that he closed his eyes and leaned on\nhis arm on the turf. There were no words to the song, but Bevis\nunderstood it all, and it made him feel so happy. The great sun smiled\nupon him, the great earth bore him in her arms gently, the wind caressed\nhim, singing all the while. Now Bevis knew what the wind meant; he felt\nwith his soul out to the far-distant sun just as easily as he could feel\nwith his hand to the bunch of grass beside him; he felt with his soul\ndown through into the earth just as easily as he could touch the sward\nwith his fingers. Something seemed to come to him out of the sunshine\nand the grass.\n\n\"There never was a yesterday,\" whispered the wind presently, \"and there\nnever will be to-morrow. It is all one long to-day. When the man in the\nhill was you were too, and he still is now you are here; but of these\nthings you will know when you are older, that is if you will only\ncontinue to drink me. Come, dear, let us race on again.\" So the two went\non and came to a hawthorn-bush, and Bevis, full of mischief always,\ntried to slip away from the wind round the bush, but the wind laughed\nand caught him.\n\nA little farther and they came to the fosse of the old camp. Bevis went\ndown into the trench, and he and the wind raced round along it as fast\nas ever they could go, till presently he ran up out of it on the hill,\nand there was the waggon underneath him, with the load well piled up\nnow. There was the plain, yellow with stubble; the hills beyond it and\nthe blue valley, just the same as he had left it.\n\nAs Bevis stood and looked down, the wind caressed him, and said:\n\"Good-bye, darling, I am going yonder, straight across to the blue\nvalley and the blue sky, where they meet; but I shall be back again when\nyou come next time. Now remember, my dear, to drink me--come up here and\ndrink me.\"\n\n\"Shall you be here?\" said Bevis, \"are you quite sure you will be here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the wind, \"I shall be quite certain to be here; I promise\nyou, love, I will never go quite away. Promise me faithfully, too, that\nyou will come up and drink me, and shout and race and be happy.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" said Bevis, beginning to go down the hill; \"good-bye, jolly\nold Wind.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, dearest,\" whispered the wind, as he went across out towards\nthe valley. As Bevis went down the hill, a blue harebell, who had been\nsinging farewell to summer all the morning, called to him and asked him\nto gather her and carry her home as she would rather go with him than\nstay now autumn was near.\n\nBevis gathered the harebell, and ran with the flower in his hand down\nthe hill, and as he ran the wild thyme kissed his feet and said: \"Come\nagain, Bevis, come again\". At the bottom of the hill the waggon was\nloaded now; so they lifted him up, and he rode home on the broad back of\nthe leader.\n\n\n",
