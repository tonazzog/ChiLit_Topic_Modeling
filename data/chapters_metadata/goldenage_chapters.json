GREAT EXAMPLES GROW\n     THIN, AND TO BE FETCHED FROM THE PASSED WORLD.\n     SIMPLICITY FLIES AWAY, AND INIQUITY COMES AT LONG\n     STRIDES UPON US.”\n\n     SIR THOMAS BROWNE\n\nPROLOGUE. THE OLYMPIANS\n\nLooking back to those days of old, ere the gate shut behind me, I can\nsee now that to children with a proper equipment of parents these things\nwould have worn a different aspect. But to those whose nearest were\naunts and uncles, a special attitude of mind may be allowed. They\ntreated us, indeed, with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh,\nbut after that with indifference (an indifference, as I recognise, the\nresult of a certain stupidity), and therewith the commonplace conviction\nthat your child is merely animal. At a very early age I remember\nrealising in a quite impersonal and kindly way the existence of that\nstupidity, and its tremendous influence in the world; while there grew\nup in me, as in the parallel case of Caliban upon Setebos, a vague sense\nof a ruling power, wilful and freakish, and prone to the practice of\nvagaries--“just choosing so:” as, for instance, the giving of authority\nover us to these hopeless and incapable creatures, when it might far\nmore reasonably have been given to ourselves over them. These elders,\nour betters by a trick of chance, commanded no respect, but only a\ncertain blend of envy--of their good luck--and pity--for their inability\nto make use of it. Indeed, it was one of the most hopeless features in\ntheir character (when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them:\nwhich wasn’t often) that, having absolute licence to indulge in the\npleasures of life, they could get no good of it. They might dabble\nin the pond all day, hunt the chickens, climb trees in the most\nuncompromising Sunday clothes; they were free to issue forth and buy\ngunpowder in the full eye of the sun--free to fire cannons and explode\nmines on the lawn: yet they never did any one of these things. No\nirresistible Energy haled them to church o’ Sundays; yet they went there\nregularly of their own accord, though they betrayed no greater delight\nin the experience than ourselves.\n\nOn the whole, the existence of these Olympians seemed to be entirely\nvoid of interests, even as their movements were confined and slow, and\ntheir habits stereotyped and senseless. To anything but appearances\nthey were blind. For them the orchard (a place elf-haunted, wonderful!)\nsimply produced so many apples and cherries: or it didn’t, when the\nfailures of Nature were not infrequently ascribed to us. They never\nset foot within fir-wood or hazel-copse, nor dreamt of the marvels hid\ntherein. The mysterious sources--sources as of old Nile--that fed the\nduck-pond had no magic for them. They were unaware of Indians, nor\nrecked they anything of bisons or of pirates (with pistols!), though the\nwhole place swarmed with such portents. They cared not about exploring\nfor robbers’ caves, nor digging for hidden treasure. Perhaps, indeed,\nit was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of\ntheir time stuffily indoors.\n\nTo be sure, there was an exception in the curate, who would receive\nunblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was\na prairie studded with herds of buffalo, which it was our delight,\nmoccasined and tomahawked, to ride down with those whoops that announce\nthe scenting of blood. He neither laughed nor sneered, as the Olympians\nwould have done; but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy, he would\ncontribute such lots of valuable suggestion as to the pursuit of this\nparticular sort of big game that, as it seemed to us, his mature age\nand eminent position could scarce have been attained without a practical\nknowledge of the creature in its native lair. Then, too, he was always\nready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding\nIndians on the shortest possible notice: in brief, a distinctly able\nman, with talents, so far as we could judge, immensely above the\nmajority. I trust he is a bishop by this time,--he had all the necessary\nqualifications, as we knew.\n\nThese strange folk had visitors sometimes,--stiff and colourless\nOlympians like themselves, equally without vital interests and\nintelligent pursuits: emerging out of the clouds, and passing away again\nto drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our ken. Then brute\nforce was pitilessly applied. We were captured, washed, and forced into\nclean collars: silently submitting, as was our wont, with more\ncontempt than anger. Anon, with unctuous hair and faces stiffened in\na conventional grin, we sat and listened to the usual platitudes. How\ncould reasonable people spend their precious time so? That was ever our\nwonder as we bounded forth at last--to the old clay-pit to make pots, or\nto hunt bears among the hazels.\n\nIt was incessant matter for amazement how these Olympians would talk\nover our heads--during meals, for instance--of this or the other social\nor political inanity, under the delusion that these pale phantasms\nof reality were among the importances of life. We illuminati, eating\nsilently, our heads full of plans and conspiracies, could have told them\nwhat real life was. We had just left it outside, and were all on fire\nto get back to it. Of course we didn’t waste the revelation on them;\nthe futility of imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated. One in\nthought and purpose, linked by the necessity of combating one hostile\nfate, a power antagonistic ever,--a power we lived to evade,--we had\nno confidants save ourselves. This strange anaemic order of beings was\nfurther removed from us, in fact, than the kindly beasts who shared\nour natural existence in the sun. The estrangement was fortified by an\nabiding sense of injustice, arising from the refusal of the Olympians\never to defend, retract, or admit themselves in the wrong, or to accept\nsimilar concessions on our part. For instance, when I flung the cat out\nof an upper window (though I did it from no ill-feeling, and it didn’t\nhurt the cat), I was ready, after a moment’s reflection, to own I was\nwrong, as a gentleman should. But was the matter allowed to end there?\nI trow not. Again, when Harold was locked up in his room all day, for\nassault and battery upon a neighbour’s pig,--an action he would have\nscorned, being indeed on the friendliest terms with the porker in\nquestion,--there was no handsome expression of regret on the discovery\nof the real culprit. What Harold had felt was not so much the\nimprisonment,--indeed he had very soon escaped by the window, with\nassistance from his allies, and had only gone back in time for his\nrelease,--as the Olympian habit. A word would have set all right; but of\ncourse that word was never spoken.\n\nWell! The Olympians are all past and gone. Somehow the sun does not seem\nto shine so brightly as it used; the trackless meadows of old time have\nshrunk and dwindled away to a few poor acres. A saddening doubt, a dull\nsuspicion, creeps over me. Et in Arcadia ego,--I certainly did once\ninhabit Arcady. Can it be I too have become an Olympian?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. A HOLIDAY.\n\nThe masterful wind was up and out, shouting and chasing, the lord of\nthe morning. Poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring swish; dead leaves\nsprang aloft, and whirled into space; and all the clear-swept heaven\nseemed to thrill with sound like a great harp.\n\nIt was one of the first awakenings of the year. The earth stretched\nherself, smiling in her sleep; and everything leapt and pulsed to\nthe stir of the giant’s movement. With us it was a whole holiday;\nthe occasion a birthday--it matters not whose. Some one of us had had\npresents, and pretty conventional speeches, and had glowed with that\nsense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to\ndeserve it. But the holiday was for all, the rapture of awakening Nature\nfor all, the various outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedge-breaking\nfor all. Colt-like I ran through the meadows, frisking happy heels in\nthe face of Nature laughing responsive. Above, the sky was bluest of the\nblue; wide pools left by the winter’s floods flashed the colour back,\ntrue and brilliant; and the soft air thrilled with the germinating touch\nthat seemed to kindle something in my own small person as well as in the\nrash primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts. Out into the brimming\nsun-bathed world I sped, free of lessons, free of discipline and\ncorrection, for one day at least. My legs ran of themselves, and though\nI heard my name called faint and shrill behind, there was no stopping\nfor me. It was only Harold, I concluded, and his legs, though shorter\nthan mine, were good for a longer spurt than this. Then I heard it\ncalled again, but this time more faintly, with a pathetic break in the\nmiddle; and I pulled up short, recognising Charlotte’s plaintive note.\n\nShe panted up anon, and dropped on the turf beside me. Neither had any\ndesire for talk; the glow and the glory of existing on this perfect\nmorning were satisfaction full and sufficient.\n\n“Where’s Harold;” I asked presently.\n\n“Oh, he’s just playin’ muffin-man, as usual,” said Charlotte with\npetulance. “Fancy wanting to be a muffin-man on a whole holiday!”\n\nIt was a strange craze, certainly; but Harold, who invented his own\ngames and played them without assistance, always stuck staunchly to\na new fad, till he had worn it quite out. Just at present he was a\nmuffin-man, and day and night he went through passages and up and down\nstaircases, ringing a noiseless bell and offering phantom muffins to\ninvisible wayfarers. It sounds a poor sort of sport; and yet--to pass\nalong busy streets of your own building, for ever ringing an imaginary\nbell and offering airy muffins of your own make to a bustling thronging\ncrowd of your own creation--there were points about the game, it\ncannot be denied, though it seemed scarce in harmony with this radiant\nwind-swept morning!\n\n“And Edward, where is he?” I questioned again.\n\n“He’s coming along by the road,” said Charlotte. “He’ll be crouching\nin the ditch when we get there, and he’s going to be a grizzly bear and\nspring out on us, only you mustn’t say I told you, ‘cos it’s to be a\nsurprise.”\n\n“All right,” I said magnanimously. “Come on and let’s be surprised.” But\nI could not help feeling that on this day of days even a grizzly felt\nmisplaced and common.\n\nSure enough an undeniable bear sprang out on us as we dropped into the\nroad; then ensued shrieks, growlings, revolver-shots, and unrecorded\nheroisms, till Edward condescended at last to roll over and die, bulking\nlarge and grim, an unmitigated grizzly. It was an understood thing, that\nwhoever took upon himself to be a bear must eventually die, sooner or\nlater, even if he were the eldest born; else, life would have been all\nstrife and carnage, and the Age of Acorns have displaced our hard-won\ncivilisation. This little affair concluded with satisfaction to all\nparties concerned, we rambled along the road, picking up the defaulting\nHarold by the way, muffinless now and in his right and social mind.\n\n“What would you do?” asked Charlotte presently,--the book of the\nmoment always dominating her thoughts until it was sucked dry and cast\naside,--“what would you do if you saw two lions in the road, one on each\nside, and you didn’t know if they was loose or if they was chained up?”\n\n“Do?” shouted Edward, valiantly, “I should--I should--I should--”\n\nHis boastful accents died away into a mumble: “Dunno what I should do.”\n\n“Shouldn’t do anything,” I observed after consideration; and really it\nwould be difficult to arrive at a wiser conclusion.\n\n“If it came to DOING,” remarked Harold, reflectively, “the lions would\ndo all the doing there was to do, wouldn’t they?”\n\n“But if they was GOOD lions,” rejoined Charlotte, “they would do as they\nwould be done by.”\n\n“Ah, but how are you to know a good lion from a bad one?” said Edward.\n“The books don’t tell you at all, and the lions ain’t marked any\ndifferent.”\n\n“Why, there aren’t any good lions,” said Harold, hastily.\n\n“Oh yes, there are, heaps and heaps,” contradicted Edward. “Nearly all\nthe lions in the story-books are good lions. There was Androcles’ lion,\nand St. Jerome’s lion, and--and--the Lion and the Unicorn--”\n\n“He beat the Unicorn,” observed Harold, dubiously, “all round the town.”\n\n“That PROVES he was a good lion,” cried Edwards triumphantly. “But the\nquestion is, how are you to tell ‘em when you see ‘em?”\n\n“_I_ should ask Martha,” said Harold of the simple creed.\n\nEdward snorted contemptuously, then turned to Charlotte. “Look here,” he\nsaid; “let’s play at lions, anyhow, and I’ll run on to that corner and\nbe a lion,--I’ll be two lions, one on each side of the road,--and\nyou’ll come along, and you won’t know whether I’m chained up or not, and\nthat’ll be the fun!”\n\n“No, thank you,” said Charlotte, firmly; “you’ll be chained up till\nI’m quite close to you, and then you’ll be loose, and you’ll tear me in\npieces, and make my frock all dirty, and p’raps you’ll hurt me as well.\n_I_ know your lions!”\n\n“No, I won’t; I swear I won’t,” protested Edward. “I’ll be quite a new\nlion this time,--something you can’t even imagine.” And he raced off to\nhis post. Charlotte hesitated; then she went timidly on, at each step\ngrowing less Charlotte, the mummer of a minute, and more the anxious\nPilgrim of all time. The lion’s wrath waxed terrible at her approach;\nhis roaring filled the startled air. I waited until they were both\nthoroughly absorbed, and then I slipped through the hedge out of the\ntrodden highway, into the vacant meadow spaces. It was not that I was\nunsociable, nor that I knew Edward’s lions to the point of satiety; but\nthe passion and the call of the divine morning were high in my blood.\n\nEarth to earth! That was the frank note, the joyous summons of the day;\nand they could not but jar and seem artificial, these human discussions\nand pretences, when boon Nature, reticent no more, was singing that\nfull-throated song of hers that thrills and claims control of every\nfibre. The air was wine; the moist earth-smell, wine; the lark’s song,\nthe wafts from the cow-shed at top of the field, the pant and smoke of\na distant train,--all were wine,--or song, was it? or odour, this\nunity they all blended into? I had no words then to describe it, that\nearth-effluence of which I was so conscious; nor, indeed, have I\nfound words since. I ran sideways, shouting; I dug glad heels into the\nsquelching soil; I splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick;\nI hurled clods skywards at random, and presently I somehow found myself\nsinging. The words were mere nonsense,--irresponsible babble; the tune\nwas an improvisation, a weary, unrhythmic thing of rise and fall: and\nyet it seemed to me a genuine utterance, and just at that moment the\none thing fitting and right and perfect. Humanity would have rejected it\nwith scorn, Nature, everywhere singing in the same key, recognised and\naccepted it without a flicker of dissent.\n\nAll the time the hearty wind was calling to me companionably from where\nhe swung and bellowed in the tree-tops. “Take me for guide to-day,” he\nseemed to plead. “Other holidays you have tramped it in the track of the\nstolid, unswerving sun; a belated truant, you have dragged a weary foot\nhomeward with only a pale, expressionless moon for company. To-day\nwhy not I, the trickster, the hypocrite? I, who whip round corners and\nbluster, relapse and evade, then rally and pursue! I can lead you the\nbest and rarest dance of any; for I am the strong capricious one, the\nlord of misrule, and I alone am irresponsible and unprincipled, and obey\nno law.” And for me, I was ready enough to fall in with the fellow’s\nhumour; was not this a whole holiday? So we sheered off together,\narm-in-arm, so to speak; and with fullest confidence I took the jigging,\nthwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me.\n\nA whimsical comrade I found him, ere he had done with me. Was it in\njest, or with some serious purpose of his own, that he brought me plump\nupon a pair of lovers, silent, face to face o’er a discreet unwinking\nstile? As a rule this sort of thing struck me as the most pitiful\ntomfoolery. Two calves rubbing noses through a gate were natural and\nright and within the order of things; but that human beings, with\nsalient interests and active pursuits beckoning them on from every side,\ncould thus--! Well, it was a thing to hurry past, shamed of face,\nand think on no more. But this morning everything I met seemed to be\naccounted for and set in tune by that same magical touch in the air;\nand it was with a certain surprise that I found myself regarding these\nfatuous ones with kindliness instead of contempt, as I rambled by,\nunheeded of them. There was indeed some reconciling influence abroad,\nwhich could bring the like antics into harmony with bud and growth and\nthe frolic air.\n\nA puff on the right cheek from my wilful companion sent me off at\na fresh angle, and presently I came in sight of the village church,\nsitting solitary within its circle of elms. From forth the vestry\nwindow projected two small legs, gyrating, hungry for foothold, with\nlarceny--not to say sacrilege--in their every wriggle: a godless sight\nfor a supporter of the Establishment. Though the rest was hidden, I knew\nthe legs well enough; they were usually attached to the body of Bill\nSaunders, the peerless bad boy of the village. Bill’s coveted booty,\ntoo, I could easily guess at that; it came from the Vicar’s store\nof biscuits, kept (as I knew) in a cupboard along with his official\ntrappings.\n\nFor a moment I hesitated; then I passed on my way. I protest I was not\non Bill’s side; but then, neither was I on the Vicar’s, and there was\nsomething in this immoral morning which seemed to say that perhaps,\nafter all, Bill had as much right to the biscuits as the Vicar, and\nwould certainly enjoy them better; and anyhow it was a disputable point,\nand no business of mine. Nature, who had accepted me for ally, cared\nlittle who had the world’s biscuits, and assuredly was not going to let\nany friend of hers waste his time in playing policeman for Society.\n\nHe was tugging at me anew, my insistent guide; and I felt sure, as I\nrambled off in his wake, that he had more holiday matter to show me. And\nso, indeed, he had; and all of it was to the same lawless tune. Like a\nblack pirate flag on the blue ocean of air, a hawk hung ominous; then,\nplummet-wise, dropped to the hedgerow, whence there rose, thin and\nshrill, a piteous voice of squealing.\n\nBy the time I got there a whisk of feathers on the turf--like scattered\nplaybills--was all that remained to tell of the tragedy just enacted.\nYet Nature smiled and sang on, pitiless, gay, impartial. To her, who\ntook no sides, there was every bit as much to be said for the hawk\nas for the chaffinch. Both were her children, and she would show no\npreferences.\n\nFurther on, a hedgehog lay dead athwart the path--nay, more than dead;\ndecadent, distinctly; a sorry sight for one that had known the fellow in\nmore bustling circumstances. Nature might at least have paused to shed\none tear over this rough jacketed little son of hers, for his wasted\naims, his cancelled ambitions, his whole career of usefulness cut\nsuddenly short. But not a bit of it! Jubilant as ever, her song went\nbubbling on, and “Death-in-Life,” and again, “Life-in-Death,” were its\nalternate burdens. And looking round, and seeing the sheep-nibbled heels\nof turnips that dotted the ground, their hearts eaten out of them in\nfrost-bound days now over and done, I seemed to discern, faintly, a\nsomething of the stern meaning in her valorous chant.\n\nMy invisible companion was singing also, and seemed at times to be\nchuckling softly to himself, doubtless at thought of the strange\nnew lessons he was teaching me; perhaps, too, at a special bit of\nwaggishness he had still in store. For when at last he grew weary of\nsuch insignificant earthbound company, he deserted me at a certain\nspot I knew; then dropped, subsided, and slunk away into nothingness.\nI raised my eyes, and before me, grim and lichened, stood the ancient\nwhipping-post of the village; its sides fretted with the initials of a\ngeneration that scorned its mute lesson, but still clipped by the stout\nrusty shackles that had tethered the wrists of such of that generation’s\nancestors as had dared to mock at order and law. Had I been an infant\nSterne, here was a grand chance for sentimental output! As things were,\nI could only hurry homewards, my moral tail well between my legs, with\nan uneasy feeling, as I glanced back over my shoulder, that there was\nmore in this chance than met the eye.\n\nAnd outside our gate I found Charlotte, alone and crying. Edward, it\nseemed, had persuaded her to hide, in the full expectation of being duly\nfound and ecstatically pounced upon; then he had caught sight of the\nbutcher’s cart, and, forgetting his obligations, had rushed off for\na ride. Harold, it further appeared, greatly coveting tadpoles, and\ntop-heavy with the eagerness of possession, had fallen into the pond.\nThis, in itself, was nothing; but on attempting to sneak in by the\nback-door, he had rendered up his duckweed-bedabbled person into the\nhands of an aunt, and had been promptly sent off to bed; and this, on\na holiday, was very much. The moral of the whipping-post was working\nitself out; and I was not in the least surprised when, on reaching\nhome, I was seized upon and accused of doing something I had never even\nthought of. And my frame of mind was such, that I could only wish most\nheartily that I had done it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. A WHITE-WASHED UNCLE\n\nIn our small lives that day was eventful when another uncle was to come\ndown from town, and submit his character and qualifications (albeit\nunconsciously) to our careful criticism. Previous uncles had been\nweighed in the balance, and--alas!--found grievously wanting. There was\nUncle Thomas--a failure from the first. Not that his disposition was\nmalevolent, nor were his habits such as to unfit him for decent society;\nbut his rooted conviction seemed to be that the reason of a child’s\nexistence was to serve as a butt for senseless adult jokes,--or what,\nfrom the accompanying guffaws of laughter, appeared to be intended for\njokes. Now, we were anxious that he should have a perfectly fair trial;\nso in the tool-house, between breakfast and lessons, we discussed\nand examined all his witticisms, one by one, calmly, critically,\ndispassionately. It was no good; we could not discover any salt in them.\nAnd as only a genuine gift of humour could have saved Uncle Thomas,--for\nhe pretended to naught besides,--he was reluctantly writ down a hopeless\nimpostor.\n\nUncle George--the youngest--was distinctly more promising. He\naccompanied us cheerily round the establishment,--suffered himself to be\nintroduced to each of the cows, held out the right hand of fellowship\nto the pig, and even hinted that a pair of pink-eyed Himalayan rabbits\nmight arrive--unexpectedly--from town some day. We were just considering\nwhether in this fertile soil an apparently accidental remark on the\nsolid qualities of guinea-pigs or ferrets might haply blossom and bring\nforth fruit, when our governess appeared on the scene. Uncle George’s\nmanner at once underwent a complete and contemptible change. His\ninterest in rational topics seemed, “like a fountain’s sickening pulse,”\n to flag and ebb away; and though Miss Smedley’s ostensible purpose was\nto take Selina for her usual walk, I can vouch for it that Selina spent\nher morning ratting, along with the keeper’s boy and me; while, if Miss\nSmedley walked with any one, it would appear to have been with Uncle\nGeorge.\n\nBut despicable as his conduct had been, he underwent no hasty\ncondemnation. The defection was discussed in all its bearings, but it\nseemed sadly clear at last that this uncle must possess some innate\nbadness of character and fondness for low company. We who from daily\nexperience knew Miss Smedley like a book--were we not only too\nwell aware that she had neither accomplishments nor charms, no\ncharacteristic, in fact, but an inbred viciousness of temper and\ndisposition? True, she knew the dates of the English kings by heart; but\nhow could that profit Uncle George, who, having passed into the army,\nhad ascended beyond the need of useful information? Our bows and arrows,\non the other hand, had been freely placed at his disposal; and a soldier\nshould not have hesitated in his choice a moment. No: Uncle George had\nfallen from grace, and was unanimously damned. And the non-arrival\nof the Himalayan rabbits was only another nail in his coffin. Uncles,\ntherefore, were just then a heavy and lifeless market, and there was\nlittle inclination to deal. Still it was agreed that Uncle William, who\nhad just returned from India, should have as fair a trial as the others;\nmore especially as romantic possibilities might well be embodied in one\nwho had held the gorgeous East in fee.\n\nSelina had kicked my shins--like the girl she is!--during a scuffle in\nthe passage, and I was still rubbing them with one hand when I found\nthat the uncle-on-approbation was half-heartedly shaking the other. A\nflorid, elderly man, and unmistakably nervous, he dropped our grimy\npaws in succession, and, turning very red, with an awkward simulation of\nheartiness, “Well, h’ are y’ all?” he said, “Glad to see me, eh?” As we\ncould hardly, in justice, be expected to have formed an opinion on him\nat that early stage, we could but look at each other in silence; which\nscarce served to relieve the tension of the situation. Indeed, the cloud\nnever really lifted during his stay. In talking it over later, some\none put forward the suggestion that he must at some time or other have\ncommitted a stupendous crime; but I could not bring myself to believe\nthat the man, though evidently unhappy, was really guilty of anything;\nand I caught him once or twice looking at us with evident kindliness,\nthough seeing himself observed, he blushed and turned away his head.\n\nWhen at last the atmosphere was clear of this depressing influence, we\nmet despondently in the potato-cellar--all of us, that is, but Harold,\nwho had been told off to accompany his relative to the station; and the\nfeeling was unanimous, that, at an uncle, William could not be allowed\nto pass. Selina roundly declared him a beast, pointing out that he had\nnot even got us a half-holiday; and, indeed, there seemed little to do\nbut to pass sentence. We were about to put it, when Harold appeared on\nthe scene; his red face, round eyes, and mysterious demeanour, hinting\nat awful portents. Speechless he stood a space: then, slowly drawing his\nhand from the pocket of his knickerbockers, he displayed on a dirty\npalm one--two--three--four half-crowns! We could but gaze--tranced,\nbreathless, mute; never had any of us seen, in the aggregate, so much\nbullion before. Then Harold told his tale.\n\n“I took the old fellow to the station,” he said, “and as we went along\nI told him all about the station-master’s family, and how I had seen\nthe porter kissing our housemaid, and what a nice fellow he was, with\nno airs, or affectation about him, and anything I thought would be of\ninterest; but he didn’t seem to pay much attention, but walked along\npuffing his cigar, and once I thought--I’m not certain, but I THOUGHT--I\nheard him say, ‘Well, thank God, that’s over!’ When we got to the\nstation he stopped suddenly, and said, ‘Hold on a minute!’ Then he\nshoved these into my hand in a frightened sort of way; and said, ‘Look\nhere, youngster! These are for you and the other kids. Buy what you\nlike--make little beasts of yourselves--only don’t tell the old people,\nmind! Now cut away home!’ So I cut.”\n\nA solemn hush fell on the assembly, broken first by the small Charlotte.\n“I didn’t know,” she observed dreamily, “that there were such good men\nanywhere in the world. I hope he’ll die to-night, for then he’ll go\nstraight to heaven!” But the repentant Selina bewailed herself with\ntears and sobs, refusing to be comforted; for that in her haste she had\ncalled this white-souled relative a beast.\n\n“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said Edward, the master-mind, rising--as\nhe always did--to the situation: “We’ll christen the piebald pig after\nhim--the one that hasn’t got a name yet. And that’ll show we’re sorry\nfor our mistake!”\n\n“I--I christened that pig this morning,” Harold guiltily confessed; “I\nchristened it after the curate. I’m very sorry--but he came and bow’ed\nto me last night, after you others had all been sent to bed early--and\nsomehow I felt I HAD to do it!”\n\n“Oh, but that doesn’t count,” said Edward hastily; “because we weren’t\nall there. We’ll take that christening off, and call it Uncle William.\nAnd you can save up the curate for the next litter!”\n\nAnd the motion being agreed to without a division, the House went into\nCommittee of Supply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS\n\n“Let’s pretend,” suggested Harold, “that we’re Cavaliers and Roundheads;\nand YOU be a Roundhead!”\n\n“O bother,” I replied drowsily, “we pretended that yesterday; and it’s\nnot my turn to be a Roundhead, anyhow.” The fact is, I was lazy, and\nthe call to arms fell on indifferent ears. We three younger ones were\nstretched at length in the orchard. The sun was hot, the season merry\nJune, and never (I thought) had there been such wealth and riot of\nbuttercups throughout the lush grass. Green-and-gold was the dominant\nkey that day. Instead of active “pretence” with its shouts and\nperspiration, how much better--I held--to lie at ease and pretend to\none’s self, in green and golden fancies, slipping the husk and passing,\na careless lounger, through a sleepy imaginary world all gold and green!\nBut the persistent Harold was not to be fobbed of.\n\n“Well, then,” he began afresh, “let’s pretend we’re Knights of the Round\nTable; and (with a rush) _I’ll_ be Lancelot!”\n\n“I won’t play unless I’m Lancelot,” I said. I didn’t mean it really, but\nthe game of Knights always began with this particular contest.\n\n“O PLEASE,” implored Harold. “You know when Edward’s here I never get a\nchance of being Lancelot. I haven’t been Lancelot for weeks!”\n\nThen I yielded gracefully. “All right,” I said. “I’ll be Tristram.”\n\n“O, but you can’t,” cried Harold again.\n\n“Charlotte has always been Tristram. She won’t play unless she’s allowed\nto be Tristram! Be somebody else this time.”\n\nCharlotte said nothing, but breathed hard, looking straight before her.\nThe peerless hunter and harper was her special hero of romance, and\nrather than see the part in less appreciative hands, she would even have\nreturned sadly to the stuffy schoolroom.\n\n“I don’t care,” I said: “I’ll be anything. I’ll be Sir Kay. Come on!”\n\nThen once more in this country’s story the mail-clad knights paced\nthrough the greenwood shaw, questing adventure, redressing wrong; and\nbandits, five to one, broke and fled discomfited to their caves. Once\nagain were damsels rescued, dragons disembowelled, and giants, in every\ncorner of the orchard, deprived of their already superfluous number of\nheads; while Palamides the Saracen waited for us by the well, and Sir\nBreuse Saunce Pite vanished in craven flight before the skilled spear\nthat was his terror and his bane. Once more the lists were dight in\nCamelot, and all was gay with shimmer of silk and gold; the earth shook\nwith thunder of horses, ash-staves flew in splinters; and the firmament\nrang to the clash of sword on helm. The varying fortune of the day swung\ndoubtful--now on this side, now on that; till at last Lancelot, grim\nand great, thrusting through the press, unhorsed Sir Tristram (an easy\ntask), and bestrode her, threatening doom; while the Cornish knight,\nforgetting hard-won fame of old, cried piteously, “You’re hurting me,\nI tell you! and you’re tearing my frock!” Then it happed that Sir Kay,\nhurtling to the rescue, stopped short in his stride, catching sight\nsuddenly, through apple-boughs, of a gleam of scarlet afar off; while\nthe confused tramp of many horses, mingled with talk and laughter, was\nborne to our ears.\n\n“What is it?” inquired Tristram, sitting up and shaking out her curls;\nwhile Lancelot forsook the clanging lists and trotted nimbly to the\nhedge.\n\nI stood spell-bound for a moment longer, and then, with a cry of\n“Soldiers!” I was off to the hedge, Charlotte picking herself up and\nscurrying after.\n\nDown the road they came, two and two, at an easy walk; scarlet flamed in\nthe eye, bits jingled and saddles squeaked delightfully; while the men,\nin a halo of dust, smoked their short clays like the heroes they were.\nIn a swirl of intoxicating glory the troop clinked and clattered by,\nwhile we shouted and waved, jumping up and down, and the big jolly\nhorsemen acknowledged the salute with easy condescension. The moment\nthey were past we were through the hedge and after them. Soldiers were\nnot the common stuff of everyday life. There had been nothing like this\nsince the winter before last, when on a certain afternoon--bare of\nleaf and monochrome in its hue of sodden fallow and frost-nipt\ncopse--suddenly the hounds had burst through the fence with their mellow\ncry, and all the paddock was for the minute reverberant of thudding hoof\nand dotted with glancing red. But this was better, since it could only\nmean that blows and bloodshed were in the air.\n\n“Is there going to be a battle?” panted Harold, hardly able to keep up\nfor excitement.\n\n“Of course there is,” I replied. “We’re just in time. Come on!”\n\nPerhaps I ought to have known better; and yet---- The pigs and poultry,\nwith whom we chiefly consorted, could instruct us little concerning\nthe peace that in these latter days lapped this sea-girt realm. In the\nschoolroom we were just now dallying with the Wars of the Roses; and\ndid not legends of the country-side inform us how Cavaliers had once\ngalloped up and down these very lanes from their quarters in the\nvillage? Here, now, were soldiers unmistakable; and if their business\nwas not fighting, what was it? Sniffing the joy of battle, we followed\nhard on their tracks.\n\n“Won’t Edward be sorry,” puffed Harold, “that he’s begun that beastly\nLatin?”\n\nIt did, indeed, seem hard. Edward, the most martial spirit of us all,\nwas drearily conjugating AMO (of all verbs) between four walls; while\nSelina, who ever thrilled ecstatic to a red coat, was struggling with\nthe uncouth German tongue. “Age,” I reflected, “carries its penalties.”\n\nIt was a grievous disappointment to us that the troop passed through the\nvillage unmolested. Every cottage, I pointed out to my companions, ought\nto have been loopholed, and strongly held. But no opposition was offered\nto the soldiers, who, indeed, conducted themselves with a recklessness\nand a want of precaution that seemed simply criminal.\n\nAt the last cottage a transitory gleam of common sense flickered across\nme, and, turning on Charlotte, I sternly ordered her back.\n\nThe small maiden, docile but exceedingly dolorous, dragged reluctant\nfeet homewards, heavy at heart that she was to behold no stout fellows\nslain that day; but Harold and I held steadily on, expecting every\ninstant to see the environing hedges crackle and spit forth the leaden\ndeath.\n\n“Will they be Indians?” inquired my brother (meaning the enemy); “or\nRoundheads, or what?”\n\nI reflected. Harold always required direct, straightforward answers--not\nfaltering suppositions.\n\n“They won’t be Indians,” I replied at last; “nor yet Roundheads. There\nhaven’t been any Roundheads seen about here for a long time. They’ll be\nFrenchmen.”\n\nHarold’s face fell. “All right,” he said; “Frenchmen’ll do; but I did\nhope they’d be Indians.”\n\n“If they were going to be Indians,” I explained, “I--I don’t think I’d\ngo on. Because when Indians take you prisoner they scalp you first, and\nthen burn you at a stake. But Frenchmen don’t do that sort of thing.”\n\n“Are you quite sure?” asked Harold doubtfully.\n\n“Quite,” I replied. “Frenchmen only shut you up in a thing called the\nBastille; and then you get a file sent in to you in a loaf of bread,\nand saw the bars through, and slide down a rope, and they all fire at\nyou--but they don’t hit you--and you run down to the seashore as hard as\nyou can, and swim off to a British frigate, and there you are!”\n\nHarold brightened up again. The programme was rather attractive.\n\n“If they try to take us prisoner,” he said, “we--we won’t run, will we?”\n\nMeanwhile, the craven foe was a long time showing himself; and we were\nreaching strange outland country, uncivilised, wherein lions might be\nexpected to prowl at nightfall. I had a stitch in my side, and both\nHarold’s stockings had come down. Just as I was beginning to have gloomy\ndoubts of the proverbial courage of Frenchmen, the officer called\nout something, the men closed up, and, breaking into a trot, the\ntroops--already far ahead--vanished out of our sight. With a sinking at\nthe heart, I began to suspect we had been fooled.\n\n“Are they charging?” cried Harold, weary, but rallying gamely.\n\n“I think not,” I replied doubtfully. “When there’s going to be a charge,\nthe officer always makes a speech, and then they draw their swords and\nthe trumpets blow, and--but let’s try a short cut. We may catch them up\nyet.”\n\nSo we struck across the fields and into another road, and pounded down\nthat, and then over more fields, panting, down-hearted, yet hoping for\nthe best. The sun went in, and a thin drizzle began to fall; we were\nmuddy, breathless, almost dead beat; but we blundered on, till at last\nwe struck a road more brutally, more callously unfamiliar than any\nroad I ever looked upon. Not a hint nor a sign of friendly direction\nor assistance on the dogged white face of it. There was no longer\nany disguising it--we were hopelessly lost. The small rain continued\nsteadily, the evening began to come on. Really there are moments when a\nfellow is justified in crying; and I would have cried too, if Harold had\nnot been there. That right-minded child regarded an elder brother as a\nveritable god; and I could see that he felt himself as secure as if a\nwhole Brigade of Guards hedged him round with protecting bayonets. But I\ndreaded sore lest he should begin again with his questions.\n\nAs I gazed in dumb appeal on the face of unresponsive nature, the sound\nof nearing wheels sent a pulse of hope through my being; increasing to\nrapture as I recognised in the approaching vehicle the familiar carriage\nof the old doctor. If ever a god emerged from a machine, it was when\nthis heaven-sent friend, recognising us, stopped and jumped out with a\ncheery hail. Harold rushed up to him at once. “Have you been there?” he\ncried. “Was it a jolly fight? who beat? were there many people killed?”\n\nThe doctor appeared puzzled. I briefly explained the situation.\n\n“I see,” said the doctor, looking grave and twisting his face this way\nand that. “Well, the fact is, there isn’t going to be any battle to-day.\nIt’s been put off, on account of the change in the weather. You will\nhave due notice of the renewal of hostilities. And now you’d better jump\nin and I’ll drive you home. You’ve been running a fine rig! Why, you\nmight have both been taken and shot as spies!”\n\nThis special danger had never even occurred to us. The thrill of it\naccentuated the cosey homelike feeling of the cushions we nestled\ninto as we rolled homewards. The doctor beguiled the journey with\nblood-curdling narratives of personal adventure in the tented field, he\nhaving followed the profession of arms (so it seemed) in every quarter\nof the globe. Time, the destroyer of all things beautiful, subsequently\nrevealed the baselessness of these legends; but what of that? There are\nhigher things than truth; and we were almost reconciled, by the time\nwe were dropped at our gate, to the fact that the battle had been\npostponed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS.\n\nIt was the day I was promoted to a tooth-brush. The girls, irrespective\nof age, had been thus distinguished some time before; why, we boys could\nnever rightly understand, except that it was part and parcel of a system\nof studied favouritism on behalf of creatures both physically inferior\nand (as was shown by a fondness for tale-bearing) of weaker mental\nfibre. It was not that we yearned after these strange instruments in\nthemselves; Edward, indeed, applied his to the scrubbing-out of his\nsquirrel’s cage, and for personal use, when a superior eye was grim\non him, borrowed Harold’s or mine, indifferently; but the nimbus of\ndistinction that clung to them--that we coveted exceedingly. What more,\nindeed, was there to ascend to, before the remote, but still possible,\nrazor and strop?\n\nPerhaps the exaltation had mounted to my head; or nature and the perfect\nmorning joined to him at disaffection; anyhow, having breakfasted,\nand triumphantly repeated the collect I had broken down in the last\nSunday--‘twas one without rhythm or alliteration: a most objectionable\ncollect--having achieved thus much, the small natural man in me\nrebelled, and I vowed, as I straddled and spat about the stable-yard in\nfeeble imitation of the coachman, that lessons might go to the Inventor\nof them. It was only geography that morning, any way: and the practical\nthing was worth any quantity of bookish theoretic; as for me, I was\ngoing on my travels, and imports and exports, populations and capitals,\nmight very well wait while I explored the breathing, coloured world\noutside.\n\nTrue, a fellow-rebel was wanted; and Harold might, as a rule, have been\ncounted on with certainty. But just then Harold was very proud. The week\nbefore he had “gone into tables,” and had been endowed with a new slate,\nhaving a miniature sponge attached, wherewith we washed the faces of\nCharlotte’s dolls, thereby producing an unhealthy pallor which struck\nterror into the child’s heart, always timorous regarding epidemic\nvisitations. As to “tables,” nobody knew exactly what they were,\nleast of all Harold; but it was a step over the heads of the rest, and\ntherefore a subject for self-adulation and--generally speaking--airs; so\nthat Harold, hugging his slate and his chains, was out of the question\nnow. In such a matter, girls were worse than useless, as wanting the\nnecessary tenacity of will and contempt for self-constituted authority.\nSo eventually I slipped through the hedge a solitary protestant, and\nissued forth on the lane what time the rest of the civilised world was\nsitting down to lessons.\n\nThe scene was familiar enough; and yet, this morning, how different\nit all seemed! The act, with its daring, tinted everything with new,\nstrange hues; affecting the individual with a sort of bruised feeling\njust below the pit of the stomach, that was intensified whenever his\nthoughts flew back to the ink-stained, smelly schoolroom. And could\nthis be really me? or was I only contemplating, from the schoolroom\naforesaid, some other jolly young mutineer, faring forth under the\ngenial sun? Anyhow, here was the friendly well, in its old place, half\nway up the lane. Hither the yoke-shouldering village-folk were wont to\ncome to fill their clinking buckets; when the drippings made worms of\nwet in the thick dust of the road. They had flat wooden crosses inside\neach pail, which floated on the top and (we were instructed) served to\nprevent the water from slopping over. We used to wonder by what magic\nthis strange principle worked, and who first invented the crosses, and\nwhether he got a peerage for it. But indeed the well was a centre of\nmystery, for a hornet’s nest was somewhere hard by, and the very thought\nwas fearsome. Wasps we knew well and disdained, storming them in their\nfastnesses. But these great Beasts, vestured in angry orange, three\nstings from which--so ‘t was averred--would kill a horse, these were\nof a different kidney, and their warning drone suggested prudence and\nretreat. At this time neither villagers nor hornets encroached on the\nstillness: lessons, apparently, pervaded all Nature. So, after dabbling\nawhile in the well--what boy has ever passed a bit of water\nwithout messing in it?--I scrambled through the hedge, avoiding the\nhornet-haunted side, and struck into the silence of the copse.\n\nIf the lane had been deserted, this was loneliness become personal. Here\nmystery lurked and peeped; here brambles caught and held with a purpose\nof their own, and saplings whipped the face with human spite. The copse,\ntoo, proved vaster in extent, more direfully drawn out, than one would\never have guessed from its frontage on the lane: and I was really glad\nwhen at last the wood opened and sloped down to a streamlet brawling\nforth into the sunlight. By this cheery companion I wandered along,\nconscious of little but that Nature, in providing store of water-rats,\nhad thoughtfully furnished provender of right-sized stones. Rapids,\nalso, there were, telling of canoes and portages--crinkling bays and\ninlets--caves for pirates and hidden treasures--the wise Dame had\nforgotten nothing--till at last, after what lapse of time I know not, my\nfurther course, though not the stream’s, was barred by some six feet\nof stout wire netting, stretched from side to side, just where a thick\nhedge, arching till it touched, forbade all further view.\n\nThe excitement of the thing was becoming thrilling. A Black Flag\nmust surely be fluttering close by. Here was evidently a malignant\ncontrivance of the Pirates, designed to baffle our gun-boats when we\ndashed up-stream to shell them from their lair. A gun-boat, indeed,\nmight well have hesitated, so stout was the netting, so close the hedge:\nbut I spied where a rabbit was wont to pass, close down by the water’s\nedge; where a rabbit could go a boy could follow, albeit stomach-wise\nand with one leg in the stream; so the passage was achieved, and I stood\ninside, safe but breathless at the sight.\n\nGone was the brambled waste, gone the flickering tangle of woodland.\nInstead, terrace after terrace of shaven sward, stone-edged,\nurn-cornered, stepped delicately down to where the stream, now tamed and\neducated, passed from one to another marble basin, in which on occasion\ngleams of red hinted at gold-fish in among the spreading water-lilies.\nThe scene lay silent and slumbrous in the brooding noonday sun: the\ndrowsing peacock squatted humped on the lawn, no fish leapt in\nthe pools, nor bird declared himself from the environing hedges.\nSelf-confessed it was here, then, at last the Garden of Sleep!\n\nTwo things, in those old days, I held in especial distrust: gamekeepers\nand gardeners. Seeing, however, no baleful apparitions of either nature,\nI pursued my way between rich flower-beds, in search of the necessary\nPrincess. Conditions declared her presence patently as trumpets; without\nthis centre such surroundings could not exist. A pavilion, gold topped,\nwreathed with lush jessamine, beckoned with a special significance over\nclose-set shrubs. There, if anywhere, She should be enshrined. Instinct,\nand some knowledge of the habits of princesses, triumphed; for (indeed)\nthere She was! In no tranced repose, however, but laughingly, struggling\nto disengage her hand from the grasp of a grown-up man who occupied the\nmarble bench with her. (As to age, I suppose now that the two swung in\nrespective scales that pivoted on twenty. But children heed no minor\ndistinctions; to them, the inhabited world is composed of the two main\ndivisions: children and upgrown people; the latter being in no way\nsuperior to the former--only hopelessly different. These two, then,\nbelonged to the grown-up section.) I paused, thinking it strange\nthey should prefer seclusion when there were fish to be caught, and\nbutterflies to hunt in the sun outside; and as I cogitated thus, the\ngrown-up man caught sight of me.\n\n“Hallo, sprat!” he said, with some abruptness, “where do you spring\nfrom?”\n\n“I came up the stream,” I explained politely and comprehensively, “and I\nwas only looking for the Princess.”\n\n“Then you are a water-baby,” he replied. “And what do you think of the\nPrincess, now you’ve found her?”\n\n“I think she is lovely,” I said (and doubtless I was right, having never\nlearned to flatter). “But she’s wide-awake, so I suppose somebody has\nkissed her!”\n\nThis very natural deduction moved the grown-up man to laughter; but\nthe Princess, turning red and jumping up, declared that it was time for\nlunch.\n\n“Come along, then,” said the grown-up man; “and you too, Water-baby;\ncome and have something solid. You must want it.”\n\nI accompanied them, without any feeling of false delicacy. The world,\nas known to me, was spread with food each several mid-day, and the\nparticular table one sat at seemed a matter of no importance. The palace\nwas very sumptuous and beautiful, just what a palace ought to be; and\nwe were met by a stately lady, rather more grownup than the\nPrincess--apparently her mother.\n\nMy friend the Man was very kind, and introduced me as the Captain,\nsaying I had just run down from Aldershot. I didn’t know where Aldershot\nwas, but had no manner of doubt that he was perfectly right. As a rule,\nindeed, grown-up people are fairly correct on matters of fact; it is in\nthe higher gift of imagination that they are so sadly to seek.\n\nThe lunch was excellent and varied. Another gentleman in beautiful\nclothes--a lord, presumably--lifted me into a high carved chair, and\nstood behind it, brooding over me like a Providence. I endeavoured to\nexplain who I was and where I had come from, and to impress the company\nwith my own tooth-brush and Harold’s tables; but either they were\nstupid--or is it a characteristic of Fairyland that every one laughs at\nthe most ordinary remarks? My friend the Man said good-naturedly, “All\nright, Water-baby; you came up the stream, and that’s good enough for\nus.” The lord--a reserved sort of man, I thought--took no share in the\nconversation.\n\nAfter lunch I walked on the terrace with the Princess and my friend the\nMan, and was very proud. And I told him what I was going to be, and he\ntold me what he was going to be; and then I remarked, “I suppose you\ntwo are going to get married?” He only laughed, after the Fairy fashion.\n“Because if you aren’t,” I added, “you really ought to”: meaning only\nthat a man who discovered a Princess, living in the right sort of\nPalace like this, and didn’t marry her there and then, was false to all\nrecognised tradition.\n\nThey laughed again, and my friend suggested I should go down to the pond\nand look at the gold-fish, while they went for a stroll.\n\nI was sleepy, and assented; but before they left me, the grown-up\nman put two half-crowns in my hand, for the purpose, he explained, of\ntreating the other water-babies. I was so touched by this crowning\nmark of friendship that I nearly cried; and thought much more of his\ngenerosity than of the fact that the Princess; ere she moved away,\nstooped down and kissed me.\n\nI watched them disappear down the path--how naturally arms seem to\ngo round waists in Fairyland!--and then, my cheek on the cool marble,\nlulled by the trickle of water, I slipped into dreamland out of real and\nmagic world alike. When I woke, the sun had gone in, a chill wind set\nall the leaves a-whispering, and the peacock on the lawn was harshly\ncalling up the rain. A wild unreasoning panic possessed me, and I sped\nout of the garden like a guilty thing, wriggled through the rabbit-run,\nand threaded my doubtful way homewards, hounded by nameless terrors. The\nhalf-crowns happily remained solid and real to the touch; but could I\nhope to bear such treasure safely through the brigand-haunted wood? It\nwas a dirty, weary little object that entered its home, at nightfall, by\nthe unassuming aid of the scullery-window: and only to be sent tealess\nto bed seemed infinite mercy to him. Officially tealess, that is; for,\nas was usual after such escapades, a sympathetic housemaid, coming\ndelicately by backstairs, stayed him with chunks of cold pudding and\ncondolence, till his small skin was tight as any drum. Then, nature\nasserting herself, I passed into the comforting kingdom of sleep, where,\na golden carp of fattest build, I oared it in translucent waters with\na new half-crown snug under right fin and left; and thrust up a nose\nthrough water-lily leaves to be kissed by a rose-flushed Princess.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. SAWDUST AND SIN\n\nA belt of rhododendrons grew close down to one side of our pond; and\nalong the edge of it many things flourished rankly. If you crept through\nthe undergrowth and crouched by the water’s rim, it was easy--if your\nimagination were in healthy working order--to transport yourself in a\ntrice to the heart of a tropical forest. Overhead the monkeys chattered,\nparrots flashed from bough to bough, strange large blossoms shone around\nyou, and the push and rustle of great beasts moving unseen thrilled you\ndeliciously. And if you lay down with your nose an inch or two from the\nwater, it was not long ere the old sense of proportion vanished clean\naway. The glittering insects that darted to and fro on its surface\nbecame sea-monsters dire, the gnats that hung above them swelled to\nalbatrosses, and the pond itself stretched out into a vast inland sea,\nwhereon a navy might ride secure, and whence at any moment the hairy\nscalp of a sea serpent might be seen to emerge.\n\nIt is impossible, however, to play at tropical forests properly, when\nhomely accents of the human voice intrude; and all my hopes of seeing a\ntiger seized by a crocodile while drinking (vide picture-books, passim)\nvanished abruptly, and earth resumed her old dimensions, when the\nsound of Charlotte’s prattle somewhere hard by broke in on my primeval\nseclusion. Looking out from the bushes, I saw her trotting towards an\nopen space of lawn the other side the pond, chattering to herself in her\naccustomed fashion, a doll tucked under either arm, and her brow knit\nwith care. Propping up her double burden against a friendly stump, she\nsat down in front of them, as full of worry and anxiety as a Chancellor\non a Budget night.\n\nHer victims, who stared resignedly in front of them, were recognisable\nas Jerry and Rosa. Jerry hailed from far Japan: his hair was straight\nand black; his one garment cotton, of a simple blue; and his reputation\nwas distinctly bad. Jerome was his proper name, from his supposed\nlikeness to the holy man who hung in a print on the staircase; though\na shaven crown was the only thing in common ‘twixt Western saint and\nEastern sinner. Rosa was typical British, from her flaxen poll to the\nstout calves she displayed so liberally, and in character she was of the\nblameless order of those who have not yet been found out.\n\nI suspected Jerry from the first; there was a latent devilry in his\nslant eyes as he sat there moodily, and knowing what he was capable of\nI scented trouble in store for Charlotte. Rosa I was not so sure about;\nshe sat demurely and upright, and looked far away into the tree-tops\nin a visionary, world-forgetting sort of way; yet the prim purse of her\nmouth was somewhat overdone, and her eyes glittered unnaturally.\n\n“Now, I’m going to begin where I left off,” said Charlotte, regardless\nof stops, and thumping the turf with her fist excitedly: “and you must\npay attention, ‘cos this is a treat, to have a story told you before\nyou’re put to bed. Well, so the White Rabbit scuttled off down the\npassage and Alice hoped he’d come back ‘cos he had a waistcoat on and\nher flamingo flew up a tree--but we haven’t got to that part yet--you\nmust wait a minute, and--where had I got to?”\n\nJerry only remained passive until Charlotte had got well under way, and\nthen began to heel over quietly in Rosa’s direction. His head fell on\nher plump shoulder, causing her to start nervously.\n\nCharlotte seized and shook him with vigour, “O Jerry,” she cried\npiteously, “if you’re not going to be good, how ever shall I tell you my\nstory?”\n\nJerry’s face was injured innocence itself. “Blame if you like, Madam,”\n he seemed to say, “the eternal laws of gravitation, but not a helpless\npuppet, who is also an orphan and a stranger in the land.”\n\n“Now we’ll go on,” began Charlotte once more. “So she got into the\ngarden at last--I’ve left out a lot, but you won’t care, I’ll tell you\nsome other time--and they were all playing croquet, and that’s where the\nflamingo comes in, and the Queen shouted out, ‘Off with her head!’”\n\nAt this point Jerry collapsed forward, suddenly and completely, his\nbald pate between his knees. Charlotte was not very angry this time. The\nsudden development of tragedy in the story had evidently been too much\nfor the poor fellow. She straightened him out, wiped his nose, and,\nafter trying him in various positions, to which he refused to adapt\nhimself, she propped him against the shoulder of the (apparently)\nunconscious Rosa. Then my eyes were opened, and the full measure of\nJerry’s infamy became apparent. This, then, was what he had been playing\nup for. The fellow had designs. I resolved to keep him under close\nobservation.\n\n“If you’d been in the garden,” went on Charlotte, reproachfully, “and\nflopped down like that when the Queen said ‘Off with his head!’ she’d\nhave offed with your head; but Alice wasn’t that sort of girl at all.\nShe just said, ‘I’m not afraid of you, you’re nothing but a pack of\ncards’--oh, dear! I’ve got to the end already, and I hadn’t begun\nhardly! I never can make my stories last out! Never mind, I’ll tell you\nanother one.”\n\nJerry didn’t seem to care, now he had gained his end, whether the\nstories lasted out or not. He was nestling against Rosa’s plump form\nwith a look of satisfaction that was simply idiotic; and one arm had\ndisappeared from view--was it round her waist? Rosa’s natural blush\nseemed deeper than usual, her head inclined shyly--it must have been\nround her waist.\n\n“If it wasn’t so near your bedtime,” continued Charlotte, reflectively,\n“I’d tell you a nice story with a bogy in it. But you’d be frightened,\nand you’d dream of bogies all night. So I’ll tell you one about a White\nBear, only you mustn’t scream when the bear says ‘Wow,’ like I used to,\n‘cos he’s a good bear really--”\n\nHere Rosa fell flat on her back in the deadest of faints. Her limbs were\nrigid, her eyes glassy; what had Jerry been doing? It must have been\nsomething very bad, for her to take on like that. I scrutinised him\ncarefully, while Charlotte ran to comfort the damsel. He appeared to be\nwhistling a tune and regarding the scenery. If I only possessed Jerry’s\ncommand of feature, I thought to myself, half regretfully, I would never\nbe found out in anything.\n\n“It’s all your fault, Jerry,” said Charlotte, reproachfully, when the\nlady had been restored to consciousness: “Rosa’s as good as gold, except\nwhen you make her wicked. I’d put you in the corner, only a stump hasn’t\ngot a corner--wonder why that is? Thought everything had corners. Never\nmind, you’ll have to sit with your face to the wall--SO. Now you can\nsulk if you like!”\n\nJerry seemed to hesitate a moment between the bliss of indulgence\nin sulks with a sense of injury, and the imperious summons of beauty\nwaiting to be wooed at his elbow; then, carried away by his passion, he\nfell sideways across Rosa’s lap. One arm stuck stiffly upwards, as in\npassionate protestation; his amorous countenance was full of entreaty.\nRosa hesitated--wavered--and yielded, crushing his slight frame under\nthe weight of her full-bodied surrender.\n\nCharlotte had stood a good deal, but it was possible to abuse even her\npatience. Snatching Jerry from his lawless embraces, she reversed him\nacross her knee, and then--the outrage offered to the whole superior\nsex in Jerry’s hapless person was too painful to witness; but though\nI turned my head away, the sound of brisk slaps continued to reach my\ntingling ears. When I looked again, Jerry was sitting up as before; his\ngarment, somewhat crumpled, was restored to its original position; but\nhis pallid countenance was set hard. Knowing as I did, only too\nwell, what a volcano of passion and shame must be seething under that\nimpassive exterior, for the moment I felt sorry for him.\n\nRosa’s face was still buried in her frock; it might have been shame, it\nmight have been grief for Jerry’s sufferings. But the callous Japanese\nnever even looked her way. His heart was exceeding bitter within him.\nIn merely following up his natural impulses he had run his head against\nconvention, and learnt how hard a thing it was; and the sunshiny world\nwas all black to him.\n\nEven Charlotte softened somewhat at the sight of his rigid misery. “If\nyou’ll say you’re sorry. Jerome,” she said, “I’ll say I’m sorry, too.”\n\nJerry only dropped his shoulders against the stump and stared out in the\ndirection of his dear native Japan, where love was no sin, and smacking\nhad not been introduced. Why had he ever left it? He would go back\nto-morrow--and yet there were obstacles: another grievance. Nature,\nin endowing Jerry with every grace of form and feature, along with a\nsensitive soul, had somehow forgotten the gift of locomotion.\n\nThere was a crackling in the bushes behind me, with sharp short pants as\nof a small steam-engine, and Rollo, the black retriever, just released\nfrom his chain by some friendly hand, burst through the underwood,\nseeking congenial company. I joyfully hailed him to stop and be a\npanther; but he sped away round the pond, upset Charlotte with a\nboisterous caress, and seizing Jerry by the middle, disappeared with him\ndown the drive. Charlotte raved, panting behind the swift-footed avenger\nof crime; Rosa lay dishevelled, bereft of consciousness; Jerry himself\nspread helpless arms to heaven, and I almost thought I heard a cry for\nmercy, a tardy promise of amendment; but it was too late. The Black Man\nhad got Jerry at last; and though the tear of sensibility might moisten\nthe eye, no one who really knew him could deny the justice of his fate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. “YOUNG ADAM CUPID”\n\nNO one would have suspected Edward of being in love, but that after\nbreakfast, with an over-acted carelessness, “Anybody who likes,” he\nsaid, “can feed my rabbits,” and he disappeared, with a jauntiness that\ndeceived nobody, in the direction of the orchard. Now, kingdoms might\ntotter and reel, and convulsions change the map of Europe; but the iron\nunwritten law prevailed, that each boy severely fed his own rabbits.\nThere was good ground, then, for suspicion and alarm; and while\nthe lettuce-leaves were being drawn through the wires, Harold and I\nconferred seriously on the situation.\n\nIt may be thought that the affair was none of our business; and indeed\nwe cared little as individuals. We were only concerned as members of a\ncorporation, for each of whom the mental or physical ailment of one of\nhis fellows might have far-reaching effects. It was thought best that\nHarold, as least open to suspicion of motive, should be despatched to\nprobe and peer. His instructions were, to proceed by a report on the\nhealth of our rabbits in particular; to glide gently into a discussion\non rabbits in general, their customs, practices, and vices; to pass\nthence, by a natural transition, to the female sex, the inherent flaws\nin its composition, and the reasons for regarding it (speaking broadly)\nas dirt. He was especially to be very diplomatic, and then to return and\nreport progress. He departed on his mission gaily; but his absence was\nshort, and his return, discomfited and in tears, seemed to betoken some\nwant of parts for diplomacy. He had found Edward, it appeared, pacing\nthe orchard, with the sort of set smile that mountebanks wear in their\nprecarious antics, fixed painfully on his face, as with pins. Harold had\nopened well, on the rabbit subject, but, with a fatal confusion between\nthe abstract and the concrete, had then gone on to remark that Edward’s\nlop-eared doe, with her long hindlegs and contemptuous twitch of the\nnose, always reminded him of Sabina Larkin (a nine-year-old damsel,\nchild of a neighbouring farmer): at which point Edward, it would seem,\nhad turned upon and savagely maltreated him, twisting his arm and\npunching him in the short ribs. So that Harold returned to the\nrabbit-hutches preceded by long-drawn wails: anon wishing, with sobs,\nthat he were a man, to kick his love-lorn brother: anon lamenting that\never he had been born.\n\nI was not big enough to stand up to Edward personally, so I had to\nconsole the sufferer by allowing him to grease the wheels of the\ndonkey-cart--a luscious treat that had been specially reserved for me,\na week past, by the gardener’s boy, for putting in a good word on his\nbehalf with the new kitchen-maid. Harold was soon all smiles and grease;\nand I was not, on the whole, dissatisfied with the significant hint that\nhad been gained as to the fons at origo mali.\n\nFortunately, means were at hand for resolving any doubts on the subject,\nsince the morning was Sunday, and already the bells were ringing for\nchurch. Lest the connexion may not be evident at first sight, I should\nexplain that the gloomy period of church-time, with its enforced\ninaction and its lack of real interest--passed, too, within sight of all\nthat the village held of fairest--was just the one when a young man’s\nfancies lightly turned to thoughts of love. For such trifling the rest\nof the week afforded no leisure; but in church--well, there was really\nnothing else to do! True, naughts-and-crosses might be indulged in on\nfly-leaves of prayer-books while the Litany dragged its slow length\nalong; but what balm or what solace could be found for the sermon?\nNaturally the eye, wandering here and there among the serried ranks,\nmade bold, untrammelled choice among our fair fellow-supplicants. It was\nin this way that, some months earlier, under the exceptional strain of\nthe Athanasian Creed, my roving fancy had settled upon the baker’s wife\nas a fit object for a life-long devotion. Her riper charms had conquered\na heart which none of her be-muslined, tittering juniors had been able\nto subdue; and that she was already wedded had never occurred to me\nas any bar to my affection. Edward’s general demeanour, then, during\nmorning service, was safe to convict him; but there was also a special\ntest for the particular case. It happened that we sat in a transept,\nand, the Larkins being behind us, Edward’s only chance of feasting on\nSabina’s charms was in the all-too fleeting interval when we swung round\neastwards. I was not mistaken. During the singing of the Benedictus the\nimpatient one made several false starts, and at last he slewed fairly\nround before “As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be” was\nhalf finished. The evidence was conclusive: a court of law could have\ndesired no better.\n\nThe fact being patent, the next thing was to grapple with it; and my\nmind was fully occupied during the sermon. There was really nothing\nunfair or unbrotherly in my attitude. A philosophic affection such as\nmine own, which clashed with nothing, was (I held) permissible; but the\nvolcanic passions in which Edward indulged about once a quarter were\na serious interference with business. To make matters worse, next week\nthere was a circus coming to the neighbourhood, to which we had all been\nstrictly forbidden to go; and without Edward no visit in contempt of law\nand orders could be successfully brought off. I had sounded him as to\nthe circus on our way to church, and he had replied briefly that the\nvery thought of a clown made him sick. Morbidity could no further\ngo. But the sermon came to an end without any line of conduct having\nsuggested itself; and I walked home in some depression, feeling sadly\nthat Venus was in the ascendant and in direful opposition, while\nAuriga--the circus star--drooped declinant, perilously near the horizon.\n\nBy the irony of fate, Aunt Eliza, of all people, turned out to be the\nDea ex machina: which thing fell out in this wise. It was that lady’s\nobnoxious practice to issue forth, of a Sunday afternoon, on a visit of\nstate to such farmers and cottagers as dwelt at hand; on which occasion\nshe was wont to hale a reluctant boy along with her, from the mixed\nmotives of propriety and his soul’s health. Much cudgelling of brains,\nI suppose, had on that particular day made me torpid and unwary. Anyhow,\nwhen a victim came to be sought for, I fell an easy prey, while the\nothers fled scatheless and whooping. Our first visit was to the Larkins.\nHere ceremonial might be viewed in its finest flower, and we conducted\nourselves, like Queen Elizabeth when she trod the measure, “high and\ndisposedly.” In the low, oak-panelled parlour, cake and currant wine\nwere set forth, and after courtesies and compliments exchanged, Aunt\nEliza, greatly condescending, talked the fashions with Mrs Larkin; while\nthe farmer and I, perspiring with the unusual effort, exchanged remarks\non the mutability of the weather and the steady fall in the price of\ncorn. (Who would have thought, to hear us, that only two short days ago\nwe had confronted each other on either side of a hedge,--I triumphant,\nprovocative, derisive; he flushed, wroth, cracking his whip, and\nvolleying forth profanity? So powerful is all-subduing ceremony!) Sabina\nthe while, demurely seated with a Pilgrim’s Progress on her knee, and\napparently absorbed in a brightly coloured presentment of “Apollyon\nStraddling Right across the Way,” eyed me at times with shy interest;\nbut repelled all Aunt Eliza’s advances with a frigid politeness for\nwhich I could not sufficiently admire her.\n\n“It’s surprising to me,” I heard my aunt remark presently, “how my\neldest nephew, Edward, despises little girls. I heard him tell Charlotte\nthe other day that he wished he could exchange her for a pair\nof Japanese guinea-pigs. It made the poor child cry. Boys are so\nheartless!” (I saw Sabina stiffen as she sat, and her tip-tilted nose\ntwitched scornfully.) “Now this boy here--” (my soul descended into my\nvery boots. Could the woman have intercepted any of my amorous glances\nat the baker’s wife?) “Now this boy,” my aunt went on, “is more human\naltogether. Only yesterday he took his sister to the baker’s shop, and\nspent his only penny buying her sweets. I thought it showed such a nice\ndisposition. I wish Edward were more like him!”\n\nI breathed again. It was unnecessary to explain my real motives for that\nvisit to the baker’s. Sabina’s face softened, and her contemptuous nose\ndescended from its altitude of scorn; she gave me one shy glance of\nkindness, and then concentrated her attention upon Mercy knocking at the\nWicket Gate. I felt awfully mean as regarded Edward; but what could I\ndo? I was in Gaza, gagged and bound; the Philistines hemmed me in.\n\nThe same evening the storm burst, the bolt fell, and--to continue the\nmetaphor--the atmosphere grew serene and clear once more. The evening\nservice was shorter than usual, the vicar, as he ascended the pulpit\nsteps, having dropped two pages out of his sermon-case,--unperceived by\nany but ourselves, either at the moment or subsequently when the hiatus\nwas reached; so as we joyfully shuffled out I whispered Edward that\nby racing home at top speed we should make time to assume our bows and\narrows (laid aside for the day) and play at Indians and buffaloes with\nAunt Eliza’s fowls--already strolling roostwards, regardless of their\ndoom--before that sedately stepping lady could return. Edward hung at\nthe door, wavering; the suggestion had unhallowed charms.\n\nAt that moment Sabina issued primly forth, and, seeing Edward, put out\nher tongue at him in the most exasperating manner conceivable; then\npassed on her way, her shoulders rigid, her dainty head held high. A\nman can stand very much in the cause of love: poverty, aunts, rivals,\nbarriers of every sort,--all these only serve to fan the flame. But\npersonal ridicule is a shaft that reaches the very vitals. Edward led\nthe race home at a speed which one of Ballantyne’s heroes might have\nequalled but never surpassed; and that evening the Indians dispersed\nAunt Eliza’s fowls over several square miles of country, so that\nthe tale of them remaineth incomplete unto this day. Edward himself,\ncheering wildly, pursued the big Cochin-China cock till the bird sank\ngasping under the drawing-room window, whereat its mistress stood\npetrified; and after supper, in the shrubbery, smoked a half-consumed\ncigar he had picked up in the road, and declared to an awe-stricken\naudience his final, his immitigable, resolve to go into the army.\n\nThe crisis was past, and Edward was saved!... And yet... sunt lachrymae\nrerem... to me watching the cigar-stump alternately pale and glow\nagainst the dark background of laurel, a vision of a tip-tilted nose,\nof a small head poised scornfully, seemed to hover on the gathering\ngloom--seemed to grow and fade and grow again, like the grin of the\nCheshire cat--pathetically, reproachfully even; and the charms of the\nbaker’s wife slipped from my memory like snow-wreaths in thaw. After\nall, Sabina was nowise to blame: why should the child be punished?\nTo-morrow I would give them the slip, and stroll round by her garden\npromiscuous-like, at a time when the farmer was safe in the rick-yard.\nIf nothing came of it, there was no harm done; and if on the\ncontrary...!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. THE BURGLARS\n\nIt was much too fine a night to think of going to bed at once, and so,\nalthough the witching hour of nine P.M. had struck, Edward and I were\nstill leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts, watching the\nplay of the cedar-branch shadows on the moonlit lawn, and planning\nschemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow. From below, strains of\nthe jocund piano declared that the Olympians were enjoying themselves\nin their listless, impotent way; for the new curate had been bidden to\ndinner that night, and was at the moment unclerically proclaiming to all\nthe world that he feared no foe. His discordant vociferations doubtless\nstarted a train of thought in Edward’s mind, for the youth presently\nremarked, a propos of nothing that had been said before, “I believe the\nnew curate’s rather gone on Aunt Maria.”\n\nI scouted the notion. “Why, she’s quite old,” I said. (She must have\nseen some five-and-twenty summers.)\n\n“Of course she is,” replied Edward, scornfully. “It’s not her, it’s her\nmoney he’s after, you bet!”\n\n“Didn’t know she had any money,” I observed timidly.\n\n“Sure to have,” said my brother, with confidence. “Heaps and heaps.”\n\nSilence ensued, both our minds being busy with the new situation thus\npresented,--mine, in wonderment at this flaw that so often declared\nitself in enviable natures of fullest endowment,--in a grown-up man\nand a good cricketer, for instance, even as this curate; Edward’s\n(apparently), in the consideration of how such a state of things,\nsupposing it existed, could be best turned to his own advantage.\n\n“Bobby Ferris told me,” began Edward in due course, “that there was a\nfellow spooning his sister once--”\n\n“What’s spooning?” I asked meekly.\n\n“Oh, _I_ dunno,” said Edward, indifferently. “It’s--it’s--it’s just a\nthing they do, you know. And he used to carry notes and messages and\nthings between ‘em, and he got a shilling almost every time.”\n\n“What, from each of ‘em?” I innocently inquired.\n\nEdward looked at me with scornful pity. “Girls never have any money,” he\nbriefly explained. “But she did his exercises and got him out of rows,\nand told stories for him when he needed it--and much better ones than he\ncould have made up for himself. Girls are useful in some ways. So he\nwas living in clover, when unfortunately they went and quarrelled about\nsomething.”\n\n“Don’t see what that’s got to do with it,” I said.\n\n“Nor don’t I,” rejoined Edward. “But anyhow the notes and things\nstopped, and so did the shillings. Bobby was fairly cornered, for he\nhad bought two ferrets on tick, and promised to pay a shilling a week,\nthinking the shillings were going on for ever, the silly young ass. So\nwhen the week was up, and he was being dunned for the shilling, he went\noff to the fellow and said, ‘Your broken-hearted Bella implores you to\nmeet her at sundown,--by the hollow oak, as of old, be it only for\na moment. Do not fail!’ He got all that out of some rotten book, of\ncourse. The fellow looked puzzled and said,--\n\n“‘What hollow oak? I don’t know any hollow oak.’\n\n“‘Perhaps it was the Royal Oak?’ said Bobby promptly, ‘cos he saw he\nhad made a slip, through trusting too much to the rotten book; but this\ndidn’t seem to make the fellow any happier.”\n\n“Should think not,” I said, “the Royal Oak’s an awful low sort of pub.”\n\n“I know,” said Edward. “Well, at last the fellow said, ‘I think I know\nwhat she means: the hollow tree in your father’s paddock. It happens to\nbe an elm, but she wouldn’t know the difference. All right: say I’ll be\nthere.’ Bobby hung about a bit, for he hadn’t got his money. ‘She was\ncrying awfully,’ he said. Then he got his shilling.”\n\n“And wasn’t the fellow riled,” I inquired, “when he got to the place and\nfound nothing?”\n\n“He found Bobby,” said Edward, indignantly. “Young Ferris was a\ngentleman, every inch of him. He brought the fellow another message from\nBella: ‘I dare not leave the house. My cruel parents immure me closely\nIf you only knew what I suffer. Your broken-hearted Bella.’ Out of the\nsame rotten book. This made the fellow a little suspicious, ‘cos it was\nthe old Ferrises who had been keen about the thing all through: the\nfellow, you see, had tin.”\n\n“But what’s that got to--” I began again.\n\n“Oh, _I_ dunno,” said Edward, impatiently. “I’m telling you just what\nBobby told me. He got suspicious, anyhow, but he couldn’t exactly call\nBella’s brother a liar, so Bobby escaped for the time. But when he was\nin a hole next week, over a stiff French exercise, and tried the same\nsort of game on his sister, she was too sharp for him, and he got caught\nout. Somehow women seem more mistrustful than men. They’re so beastly\nsuspicious by nature, you know.”\n\n“_I_ know,” said I. “But did the two--the fellow and the sister--make it\nup afterwards?”\n\n“I don’t remember about that,” replied Edward, indifferently; “but Bobby\ngot packed off to school a whole year earlier than his people meant to\nsend him,--which was just what he wanted. So you see it all came right\nin the end!”\n\nI was trying to puzzle out the moral of this story--it was evidently\nmeant to contain one somewhere--when a flood of golden lamplight mingled\nwith the moon rays on the lawn, and Aunt Maria and the new curate\nstrolled out on the grass below us, and took the direction of a garden\nseat that was backed by a dense laurel shrubbery reaching round in a\nhalf-circle to the house. Edward mediated moodily. “If we only knew what\nthey were talking about,” said he, “you’d soon see whether I was right\nor not. Look here! Let’s send the kid down by the porch to reconnoitre!”\n\n“Harold’s asleep,” I said; “it seems rather a shame--”\n\n“Oh, rot!” said my brother; “he’s the youngest, and he’s got to do as\nhe’s told!”\n\nSo the luckless Harold was hauled out of bed and given his\nsailing-orders. He was naturally rather vexed at being stood up suddenly\non the cold floor, and the job had no particular interest for him; but\nhe was both staunch and well disciplined. The means of exit were simple\nenough. A porch of iron trellis came up to within easy reach of the\nwindow, and was habitually used by all three of us, when modestly\nanxious to avoid public notice. Harold climbed deftly down the porch\nlike a white rat, and his night gown glimmered a moment on the gravel\nwalk ere he was lost to sight in the darkness of the shrubbery. A brief\ninterval of silence ensued, broken suddenly by a sound of scuffle, and\nthen a shrill, long-drawn squeal, as of metallic surfaces in friction.\nOur scout had fallen into the hands of the enemy!\n\nIndolence alone had made us devolve the task of investigation on our\nyounger brother. Now that danger had declared itself, there was no\nhesitation. In a second we were down the side of the porch, and crawling\nCherokee-wise through the laurels to the back of the garden-seat.\nPiteous was the sight that greeted us. Aunt Maria was on the seat, in\na white evening frock, looking--for an aunt--really quite nice. On the\nlawn stood an incensed curate, grasping our small brother by a large\near, which--judging from the row he was making--seemed on the point\nof parting company with the head it adorned. The gruesome noise he was\nemitting did not really affect us otherwise than aesthetically. To\none who has tried both, the wail of genuine physical anguish is easy\ndistinguishable from the pumped-up ad misericordiam blubber. Harold’s\ncould clearly be recognised as belonging to the latter class. “Now, you\nyoung--” (whelp, _I_ think it was, but Edward stoutly maintains it was\ndevil), said the curate, sternly; “tell us what you mean by it!”\n\n“Well, leggo of my ear then!” shrilled Harold, “and I’ll tell you the\nsolemn truth!”\n\n“Very well,” agreed the curate, releasing him; “now go ahead, and don’t\nlie more than you can help.”\n\nWe abode the promised disclosure without the least misgiving; but even\nwe had hardly given Harold due credit for his fertility of resource and\npowers of imagination.\n\n“I had just finished saying my prayers,” began that young gentleman,\nslowly, “when I happened to look out of the window, and on the lawn I\nsaw a sight which froze the marrow in my veins! A burglar was\napproaching the house with snake-like tread! He had a scowl and a dark\nlantern, and he was armed to the teeth!”\n\nWe listened with interest. The style, though unlike Harold’s native\nnotes, seemed strangely familiar.\n\n“Go on,” said the curate, grimly.\n\n“Pausing in his stealthy career,” continued Harold, “he gave a low\nwhistle. Instantly the signal was responded to, and from the adjacent\nshadows two more figures glided forth. The miscreants were both armed to\nthe teeth.”\n\n“Excellent,” said the curate; “proceed.”\n\n“The robber chief,” pursued Harold, warming to his work, “joined\nhis nefarious comrades, and conversed with them in silent tones. His\nexpression was truly ferocious, and I ought to have said that he was\narmed to the t--”\n\n“There, never mind his teeth,” interrupted the curate, rudely; “there’s\ntoo much jaw about you altogether. Hurry up and have done.”\n\n“I was in a frightful funk,” continued the narrator, warily guarding his\near with his hand, “but just then the drawing-room window opened, and\nyou and Aunt Maria came out--I mean emerged. The burglars vanished\nsilently into the laurels, with horrid implications!”\n\nThe curate looked slightly puzzled. The tale was well sustained, and\ncertainly circumstantial. After all, the boy might have really seen\nsomething. How was the poor man to know--though the chaste and lofty\ndiction might have supplied a hint--that the whole yarn was a free\nadaptation from the last Penny Dreadful lent us by the knife-and-boot\nboy?\n\n“Why did you not alarm the house?” he asked.\n\n“‘Cos I was afraid,” said Harold, sweetly, “that p’raps they mightn’t\nbelieve me!”\n\n“But how did you get down here, you naughty little boy?” put in Aunt\nMaria.\n\nHarold was hard pressed--by his own flesh and blood, too!\n\nAt that moment Edward touched me on the shoulder and glided off through\nthe laurels. When some ten yards away he gave a low whistle. I replied\nby another. The effect was magical. Aunt Maria started up with a shriek.\nHarold gave one startled glance around, and then fled like a hare, made\nstraight for the back door, burst in upon the servants at supper, and\nburied himself in the broad bosom of the cook, his special ally. The\ncurate faced the laurels--hesitatingly. But Aunt Maria flung herself on\nhim. “O Mr. Hodgitts!” I heard her cry, “you are brave! for my sake do\nnot be rash!” He was not rash. When I peeped out a second later, the\ncoast was entirely clear.\n\nBy this time there were sounds of a household timidly emerging; and\nEdward remarked to me that perhaps we had better be off. Retreat was an\neasy matter. A stunted laurel gave a leg up on to the garden wall, which\nled in its turn to the roof of an out-house, up which, at a dubious\nangle, we could crawl to the window of the box-room. This overland route\nhad been revealed to us one day by the domestic cat, when hard\npressed in the course of an otter-hunt, in which the cat--somewhat\nunwillingly--was filling the title role; and it had proved distinctly\nuseful on occasions like the present. We were snug in bed--minus some\ncuticle from knees and elbows--and Harold, sleepily chewing something\nsticky, had been carried up in the arms of the friendly cook, ere the\nclamour of the burglar-hunters had died away.\n\nThe curate’s undaunted demeanour, as reported by Aunt Maria, was\ngenerally supposed to have terrified the burglars into flight, and much\nkudos accrued to him thereby. Some days later, however, when he hid\ndropped in to afternoon tea, and was making a mild curatorial joke\nabout the moral courage required for taking the last piece of\nbread-and-butter, I felt constrained to remark dreamily, and as it were\nto the universe at large, “Mr. Hodgitts! you are brave! for my sake, do\nnot be rash!”\n\nFortunately for me, the vicar was also a caller on that day; and it was\nalways a comparatively easy matter to dodge my long-coated friend in the\nopen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. A HARVESTING\n\nThe year was in its yellowing time, and the face of Nature a study in\nold gold. “A field or, semee, with garbs of the same:” it may be false\nHeraldry--Nature’s generally is--but it correctly blazons the display\nthat Edward and I considered from the rickyard gate, Harold was not\non in this scene, being stretched upon the couch of pain; the special\ndisorder stomachic, as usual.\n\nThe evening before, Edward, in a fit of unwonted amiability, had deigned\nto carve me out a turnip lantern, an art-and-craft he was peculiarly\ndeft in; and Harold, as the interior of the turnip flew out in scented\nfragments under the hollowing knife, had eaten largely thereof:\nregarding all such jetsam as his special perquisite. Now he was dreeing\nhis weird, with such assistance as the chemist could afford. But Edward\nand I, knowing that this particular field was to be carried to-day,\nwere revelling in the privilege of riding in the empty waggons from the\nrickyard back to the sheaves, whence we returned toilfully on foot,\nto career it again over the billowy acres in these great galleys of\na stubble sea. It was the nearest approach to sailing that we inland\nurchins might compass: and hence it ensued, that such stirring scenes as\nSir Richard Grenville on the Revenge, the smoke-wreathed Battle of the\nNile, and the Death of Nelson, had all been enacted in turn on these\ndusty quarter decks, as they swayed and bumped afield.\n\nAnother waggon had shot its load, and was jolting out through the\nrickyard gate, as we swung ourselves in, shouting, over its tail.\n\nEdward was the first up, and, as I gained my feet, he clutched me in a\ndeath-grapple. I was a privateersman, he proclaimed, and he the captain\nof the British frigate Terpsichore, of--I forget the precise number\nof guns. Edward always collared the best parts to himself; but I was\nholding my own gallantly, when I suddenly discovered that the floor we\nbattled on was swarming with earwigs. Shrieking, I hurled free of him,\nand rolled over the tail-board on to the stubble. Edward executed a\nwar-dance of triumph on the deck of the retreating galleon; but I cared\nlittle for that. I knew HE knew that I wasn’t afraid of him, but that\nI was--and terribly--of earwigs, “those mortal bugs o’ the field.” So\nI let him disappear, shouting lustily for all hands to repel boarders,\nwhile I strolled inland, down the village.\n\nThere was a touch of adventure in the expedition. This was not our own\nvillage, but a foreign one, distant at least a mile. One felt that\nsense of mingled distinction and insecurity which is familiar to\nthe traveller: distinction, in that folk turned the head to note you\ncuriously; insecurity, by reason of the ever-present possibility of\nmissiles on the part of the more juvenile inhabitants, a class eternally\nconservative. Elated with isolation, I went even more nose-in-air than\nusual: and “even so,” I mused, “might Mungo Park have threaded the\ntrackless African forest and...” Here I plumped against a soft, but\nresisting body.\n\nRecalled to my senses by the shock, I fell back in the attitude every\nboy under these circumstances instinctively adopts--both elbows well up\nover the ears. I found myself facing a tall elderly man, clean-shaven,\nclad in well-worn black--a clergyman evidently; and I noted at once\na far-away look in his eyes, as if they were used to another plane of\nvision, and could not instantly focus things terrestrial, being suddenly\nrecalled thereto. His figure was bent in apologetic protest: “I ask a\nthousand pardons, sir,” he said; “I am really so very absent-minded. I\ntrust you will forgive me.”\n\nNow most boys would have suspected chaff under this courtly style of\naddress. I take infinite credit to myself for recognising at once\nthe natural attitude of a man to whom his fellows were gentlemen all,\nneither Jew nor Gentile, clean nor unclean. Of course, I took the blame\non myself; adding, that I was very absent-minded too,--which was indeed\nthe case.\n\n“I perceive,” he said pleasantly, “that we have something in common. I,\nan old man, dream dreams; you, a young one, see visions. Your lot is\nthe happier. And now--” his hand had been resting all this time on a\nwicket-gate--“you are hot, it is easily seen; the day is advanced, Virgo\nis the Zodiacal sign. Perhaps I may offer you some poor refreshment, if\nyour engagements will permit.”\n\nMy only engagement that afternoon was an arithmetic lesson, and I had\nnot intended to keep it in any case; so I passed in, while he held\nthe gate open politely, murmuring “Venit Hesperus ite, capellae: come,\nlittle kid!” and then apologising abjectly for a familiarity which (he\nsaid) was less his than the Roman poet’s. A straight flagged walk led up\nto the cool-looking old house, and my host, lingering in his progress at\nthis rose-tree and that, forgot all about me at least twice, waking up\nand apologising humbly after each lapse. During these intervals I put\ntwo and two together, and identified him as the Rector: a bachelor,\neccentric, learned exceedingly, round whom the crust of legend was\nalready beginning to form; to myself an object of special awe, in that\nhe was alleged to have written a real book. “Heaps o’ books,” Martha,\nmy informant, said; but I knew the exact rate of discount applicable to\nMartha’s statements.\n\nWe passed eventually through a dark hall into a room which struck me\nat once as the ideal I had dreamed but failed to find. None of your\nfeminine fripperies here! None of your chair-backs and tidies! This man,\nit was seen, groaned under no aunts. Stout volumes in calf and vellum\nlined three sides; books sprawled or hunched themselves on chairs and\ntables; books diffused the pleasant odour of printers’ ink and bindings;\ntopping all, a faint aroma of tobacco cheered and heartened exceedingly,\nas under foreign skies the flap and rustle over the wayfarer’s head\nof the Union Jack--the old flag of emancipation! And in one corner,\nbook-piled like the rest of the furniture, stood a piano.\n\nThis I hailed with a squeal of delight. “Want to strum?” inquired my\nfriend, as if it was the most natural wish in the world--his eyes were\nalready straying towards another corner, where bits of writing-table\npeeped out from under a sort of Alpine system of book and foolscap.\n\n“O, but may I?” I asked in doubt. “At home I’m not allowed to--only\nbeastly exercises!”\n\n“Well, you can strum here, at all events,” he replied; and murmuring\nabsently, Age, dic Latinum, barbite, carmen, he made his way,\nmechanically guided as it seemed, to the irresistible writing-able. In\nten seconds he was out of sight and call. A great book open on his knee,\nanother propped up in front, a score or so disposed within easy reach,\nhe read and jotted with an absorption almost passionate. I might have\nbeen in Boeotia, for any consciousness he had of me. So with a light\nheart I turned to and strummed.\n\nThose who painfully and with bleeding feet have scaled the crags of\nmastery over musical instruments have yet their loss in this,--that the\nwild joy of strumming has become a vanished sense. Their happiness comes\nfrom the concord and the relative value of the notes they handle:\nthe pure, absolute quality and nature of each note in itself are only\nappreciated by the strummer. For some notes have all the sea in them,\nand some cathedral bells; others a woodland joyance and a smell of\ngreenery; in some fauns dance to the merry reed, and even the grave\ncentaurs peep out from their caves. Some bring moonlight, and some the\ndeep crimson of a rose’s heart; some are blue, some red, and others will\ntell of an army with silken standards and march-music. And throughout\nall the sequence of suggestion, up above the little white men leap and\npeep, and strive against the imprisoning wires; and all the big rosewood\nbox hums as it were full of hiving bees.\n\nSpent with the rapture, I paused a moment and caught my friend’s eye\nover the edge of a folio. “But as for these Germans,” he began abruptly,\nas if we had been in the middle of a discussion, “the scholarship\nis there, I grant you; but the spark, the fine perception, the happy\nintuition, where is it? They get it all from us!”\n\n“They get nothing whatever from US,” I said decidedly: the word German\nonly suggesting Bands, to which Aunt Eliza was bitterly hostile.\n\n“You think not?” he rejoined, doubtfully, getting up and walking about\nthe room. “Well, I applaud such fairness and temperance in so young a\ncritic. They are qualities--in youth--as rare as they are pleasing. But\njust look at Schrumpffius, for instance--how he struggles and wrestles\nwith a simple {GREEK gar} in this very passage here!”\n\nI peeped fearfully through the open door, half-dreading to see some\nsinuous and snark-like conflict in progress on the mat; but all was\nstill. I saw no trouble at all in the passage, and I said so.\n\n“Precisely,” he cried, delighted. “To you, who possess the natural\nscholar’s faculty in so happy a degree, there is no difficulty at\nall. But to this Schrumpffius--” But here, luckily for me, in came the\nhousekeeper, a clean-looking woman of staid aspect.\n\n“Your tea is in the garden,” she said, as if she were correcting a\nfaulty emendation. “I’ve put some cakes and things for the little\ngentleman; and you’d better drink it before it gets cold.”\n\nHe waved her off and continued his stride, brandishing an aorist over my\ndevoted head. The housekeeper waited unmoved till there fell a moment’s\nbreak in his descant; and then, “You’d better drink it before it\ngets cold,” she observed again, impassively. The wretched man cast a\ndeprecating look at me. “Perhaps a little tea would be rather nice,” he\nobserved, feebly; and to my great relief he led the way into the garden.\nI looked about for the little gentleman, but, failing to discover him, I\nconcluded he was absent-minded too, and attacked the “cakes and things”\n with no misgivings.\n\nAfter a most successful and most learned tea a something happened which,\nsmall as I was, never quite shook itself out of my memory.\n\nTo us at parley in an arbour over the high road, there entered,\nslouching into view, a dingy tramp, satellited by a frowsy woman and a\npariah dog; and, catching sight of us, he set up his professional whine;\nand I looked at my friend with the heartiest compassion, for I knew\nwell from Martha--it was common talk--that at this time of day he was\ncertainly and surely penniless. Morn by morn he started forth with\npockets lined; and each returning evening found him with never a sou.\nAll this he proceeded to explain at length to the tramp, courteously\nand even shamefacedly, as one who was in the wrong; and at last the\ngentleman of the road, realising the hopelessness of his case, set to\nand cursed him with gusto, vocabulary, and abandonment. He reviled\nhis eyes, his features, his limbs, his profession, his relatives and\nsurroundings; and then slouched off, still oozing malice and filth. We\nwatched the party to a turn in the road, where the woman, plainly weary,\ncame to a stop. Her lord, after some conventional expletives demanded of\nhim by his position, relieved her of her bundle, and caused her to hang\non his arm with a certain rough kindness of tone, and in action even a\ndim approach to tenderness; and the dingy dog crept up for one lick at\nher hand.\n\n“See,” said my friend, bearing somewhat on my shoulder, “how this\nstrange thing, this love of ours, lives and shines out in the\nunlikeliest of places! You have been in the fields in early morning?\nBarren acres, all! But only stoop--catch the light thwartwise--and all\nis a silver network of gossamer! So the fairy filaments of this strange\nthing underrun and link together the whole world. Yet it is not the old\nimperious god of the fatal bow--{GREEK}not that--nor even the placid\nrespectable {GREEK}--but something still unnamed, perhaps more\nmysterious, more divine! Only one must stoop to see it, old fellow, one\nmust stoop!”\n\nThe dew was falling, the dusk closing, as I trotted briskly homewards\ndown the road. Lonely spaces everywhere, above and around. Only Hesperus\nhung in the sky, solitary, pure, ineffably far-drawn and remote; yet\ninfinitely heartening, somehow, in his valorous isolation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. SNOWBOUND\n\nTwelfth-night had come and gone, and life next morning seemed a trifle\nflat and purposeless. But yester-eve and the mummers were here! They had\ncome striding into the old kitchen, powdering the red brick floor with\nsnow from their barbaric bedizenments; and stamping, and crossing, and\ndeclaiming, till all was whirl and riot and shout. Harold was frankly\nafraid: unabashed, he buried himself in the cook’s ample bosom. Edward\nfeigned a manly superiority to illusion, and greeted these awful\napparitions familiarly, as Dick and Harry and Joe. As for me, I was too\nbig to run, too rapt to resist the magic and surprise. Whence came\nthese outlanders, breaking in on us with song and ordered masque and\na terrible clashing of wooden swords? And after these, what strange\nvisitants might we not look for any quiet night, when the chestnuts\npopped in the ashes, and the old ghost stories drew the awe-stricken\ncircle close? Old Merlin, perhaps, “all furred in black sheep-skins,\nand a russet gown, with a bow and arrows, and bearing wild geese in his\nhand!” Or stately Ogier the Dane, recalled from Faery, asking his way\nto the land that once had need of him! Or even, on some white night,\nthe Snow-Queen herself, with a chime of sleigh-bells and the patter of\nreindeers’ feet, with sudden halt at the door flung wide, while aloft\nthe Northern Lights went shaking attendant spears among the quiet stars!\n\nThis morning, house-bound by the relentless, indefatigable snow, I was\nfeeling the reaction Edward, on the contrary, being violently stage\nstruck on this his first introduction to the real Drama, was striding up\nand down the floor, proclaiming “Here be I, King Gearge the Third,” in a\nstrong Berkshire accent. Harold, accustomed, as the youngest, to lonely\nantics and to sports that asked no sympathy, was absorbed in “clubmen”:\na performance consisting in a measured progress round the room\narm-in-arm with an imaginary companion of reverend years, with\noccasional halts at imaginary clubs, where--imaginary steps being\nleisurely ascended--imaginary papers were glanced at, imaginary scandal\nwas discussed with elderly shakings of the head, and--regrettable to\nsay--imaginary glasses were lifted lipwards. Heaven only knows how the\ngerm of this dreary pastime first found way into his small-boyish\nbeing. It was his own invention, and he was proportionately proud of\nit. Meanwhile, Charlotte and I, crouched in the window-seat, watched,\nspell-stricken, the whirl and eddy and drive of the innumerable\nsnow-flakes, wrapping our cheery little world in an uncanny uniform,\nghastly in line and hue.\n\nCharlotte was sadly out of spirits. Having “countered” Miss Smedley at\nbreakfast, during some argument or other, by an apt quotation from\nher favourite classic (the Fairy Book) she had been gently but firmly\ninformed that no such things as fairies ever really existed. “Do you\nmean to say it’s all lies?” asked Charlotte, bluntly. Miss Smedley\ndeprecated the use of any such unladylike words in any connection at\nall. “These stories had their origin, my dear,” she explained, “in a\nmistaken anthropomorphism in the interpretation of nature. But though we\nare now too well informed to fall into similar errors, there are still\nmany beautiful lessons to be learned from these myths--”\n\n“But how can you learn anything,” persisted Charlotte, “from what\ndoesn’t exist?” And she left the table defiant, howbeit depressed.\n\n“Don’t you mind HER,” I said, consolingly; “how can she know anything\nabout it? Why, she can’t even throw a stone properly!”\n\n“Edward says they’re all rot, too,” replied Charlotte, doubtfully.\n\n“Edward says everything’s rot,” I explained, “now he thinks he’s going\ninto the Army. If a thing’s in a book it MUST be true, so that settles\nit!”\n\nCharlotte looked almost reassured. The room was quieter now, for Edward\nhad got the dragon down and was boring holes in him with a purring\nsound Harold was ascending the steps of the Athenaeum with a jaunty\nair--suggestive rather of the Junior Carlton. Outside, the tall\nelm-tops were hardly to be seen through the feathery storm. “The sky’s\na-falling,” quoted Charlotte, softly; “I must go and tell the king.”\n The quotation suggested a fairy story, and I offered to read to\nher, reaching out for the book. But the Wee Folk were under a cloud;\nsceptical hints had embittered the chalice. So I was fain to fetch\nArthur--second favourite with Charlotte for his dames riding errant, and\nan easy first with us boys for his spear-splintering crash of tourney\nand hurtle against hopeless odds. Here again, however, I proved\nunfortunate,--what ill-luck made the book open at the sorrowful history\nof Balin and Balan? “And he vanished anon,” I read: “and so he heard\nan horne blow, as it had been the death of a beast. ‘That blast,’ said\nBalin, ‘is blowen for me, for I am the prize, and yet am I not dead.’”\n Charlotte began to cry: she knew the rest too well. I shut the book in\ndespair. Harold emerged from behind the arm-chair. He was sucking his\nthumb (a thing which members of the Reform are seldom seen to do),\nand he stared wide-eyed at his tear stained sister. Edward put off his\nhistrionics, and rushed up to her as the consoler--a new part for him.\n\n“I know a jolly story,” he began. “Aunt Eliza told it me. It was when\nshe was somewhere over in that beastly abroad”--(he had once spent a\nblack month of misery at Dinan)--“and there was a fellow there who had\ngot two storks. And one stork died--it was the she-stork.” (“What did\nit die of?” put in Harold.) “And the other stork was quite sorry, and\nmoped, and went on, and got very miserable. So they looked about and\nfound a duck, and introduced it to the stork. The duck was a drake, but\nthe stork didn’t mind, and they loved each other and were as jolly\nas could be. By and by another duck came along,--a real she-duck this\ntime,--and when the drake saw her he fell in love, and left the stork,\nand went and proposed to the duck: for she was very beautiful. But the\npoor stork who was left, he said nothing at all to anybody, but just\npined and pined and pined away, till one morning he was found quite\ndead! But the ducks lived happily ever afterwards!”\n\nThis was Edward’s idea of a jolly story! Down again went the corners of\npoor Charlotte’s mouth. Really Edward’s stupid inability to see the real\npoint in anything was TOO annoying! It was always so. Years before, it\nbeing necessary to prepare his youthful mind for a domestic event that\nmight lead to awkward questionings at a time when there was little\nleisure to invent appropriate answers, it was delicately inquired of\nhim whether he would like to have a little brother, or perhaps a little\nsister? He considered the matter carefully in all its bearings, and\nfinally declared for a Newfoundland pup. Any boy more “gleg at the\nuptak” would have met his parents half-way, and eased their burden.\nAs it was, the matter had to be approached all over again from a fresh\nstandpoint. And now, while Charlotte turned away sniffingly, with a\nhiccough that told of an overwrought soul, Edward, unconscious (like Sir\nIsaac’s Diamond) of the mischief he had done, wheeled round on Harold\nwith a shout.\n\n“I want a live dragon,” he announced: “you’ve got to be my dragon!”\n\n“Leave me go, will you?” squealed Harold, struggling stoutly. “I’m\nplayin’ at something else. How can I be a dragon and belong to all the\nclubs?”\n\n“But wouldn’t you like to be a nice scaly dragon, all green,” said\nEdward, trying persuasion, “with a curly tail and red eyes, and\nbreathing real smoke and fire?”\n\nHarold wavered an instant: Pall-Mall was still strong in him. The next\nhe was grovelling on the floor. No saurian ever swung a tail so scaly\nand so curly as his. Clubland was a thousand years away. With horrific\npants he emitted smokiest smoke and fiercest fire.\n\n“Now I want a Princess,” cried Edward, clutching Charlotte ecstatically;\n“and YOU can be the doctor, and heal me from the dragon’s deadly wound.”\n\nOf all professions I held the sacred art of healing in worst horror and\ncontempt. Cataclysmal memories of purge and draught crowded thick on me,\nand with Charlotte--who courted no barren honours--I made a break for\nthe door. Edward did likewise, and the hostile forces clashed together\non the mat, and for a brief space things were mixed and chaotic and\nArthurian. The silvery sound of the luncheon-bell restored an instant\npeace, even in the teeth of clenched antagonisms like ours. The Holy\nGrail itself, “sliding athwart a sunbeam,” never so effectually stilled\na riot of warring passions into sweet and quiet accord.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT\n\nEdward was standing ginger-beer like a gentleman, happening, as the one\nthat had last passed under the dentist’s hands, to be the capitalist\nof the flying hour. As in all well-regulated families, the usual tariff\nobtained in ours,--half-a-crown a tooth; one shilling only if the\nmolar were a loose one. This one, unfortunately--in spite of Edward’s\ninterested affectation of agony--had been shaky undisguised; but the\nevent was good enough to run to ginger-beer. As financier, however,\nEdward had claimed exemption from any servile duties of procurement,\nand had swaggered about the garden while I fetched from the village\npost-office, and Harold stole a tumbler from the pantry. Our\npreparations complete, we were sprawling on the lawn; the staidest and\nmost self respecting of the rabbits had been let loose to grace the\nfeast, and was lopping demurely about the grass, selecting the juiciest\nplantains; while Selina, as the eldest lady present, was toying, in her\naffected feminine way, with the first full tumbler, daintily fishing for\nbits of broken cork.\n\n“Hurry up, can’t you?” growled our host; “what are you girls always so\nbeastly particular for?”\n\n“Martha says,” explained Harold (thirsty too, but still just), “that\nif you swallow a bit of cork, it swells, and it swells, and it swells\ninside you, till you--”\n\n“O bosh!” said Edward, draining the glass with a fine pretence of\nindifference to consequences, but all the same (as I noticed) dodging\nthe floating cork-fragments with skill and judgment.\n\n“O, it’s all very well to say bosh,” replied Harold, nettled; “but every\none knows it’s true but you. Why, when Uncle Thomas was here last, and\nthey got up a bottle of wine for him, he took just one tiny sip out of\nhis glass, and then he said, ‘Poo, my goodness, that’s corked!’ And he\nwouldn’t touch it. And they had to get a fresh bottle up. The funny part\nwas, though, I looked in his glass afterwards, when it was brought out\ninto the passage, and there wasn’t any cork in it at all! So I drank it\nall off, and it was very good!”\n\n“You’d better be careful, young man!” said his elder brother, regarding\nhim severely. “D’ you remember that night when the Mummers were here,\nand they had mulled port, and you went round and emptied all the glasses\nafter they had gone away?”\n\n“Ow! I did feel funny that night,” chuckled Harold. “Thought the house\nwas comin’ down, it jumped about so; and Martha had to carry me up to\nbed, ‘cos the stairs was goin’ all waggity!”\n\nWe gazed searchingly at our graceless junior; but it was clear that\nhe viewed the matter in the light of a phenomenon rather than of a\ndelinquency.\n\nA third bottle was by this time circling; and Selina, who had evidently\nwaited for it to reach her, took a most unfairly long pull, and then\njumping up and shaking out her frock, announced that she was going for a\nwalk. Then she fled like a hare; for it was the custom of our Family to\nmeet with physical coercion any independence of action in individuals.\n\n“She’s off with those Vicarage girls again,” said Edward, regarding\nSelina’s long black legs twinkling down the path. “She goes out with\nthem every day now; and as soon as ever they start, all their heads go\ntogether and they chatter, chatter, chatter the whole blessed time!\nI can’t make out what they find to talk about. They never stop; it’s\ngabble, gabble, gabble right along, like a nest of young rooks!”\n\n“P’raps they talk about birds’-eggs,” I suggested sleepily (the sun\nwas hot, the turf soft, the ginger-beer potent); “and about ships, and\nbuffaloes, and desert islands; and why rabbits have white tails; and\nwhether they’d sooner have a schooner or a cutter; and what they’ll be\nwhen they’re men--at least, I mean there’s lots of things to talk about,\nif you WANT to talk.”\n\n“Yes; but they don’t talk about those sort of things at all,” persisted\nEdward. “How CAN they? They don’t KNOW anything; they can’t DO\nanything--except play the piano, and nobody would want to talk about\nTHAT; and they don’t care about anything--anything sensible, I mean. So\nwhat DO they talk about?”\n\n“I asked Martha once,” put in Harold; “and she said, ‘Never YOU mind;\nyoung ladies has lots of things to talk about that young gentlemen can’t\nunderstand.’”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” Edward growled.\n\n“Well, that’s what she SAID, anyway,” rejoined Harold, indifferently.\nThe subject did not seem to him of first-class importance, and it was\nhindering the circulation of the ginger-beer.\n\nWe heard the click of the front-gate. Through a gap in the hedge we\ncould see the party setting off down the road. Selina was in the middle:\na Vicarage girl had her by either arm; their heads were together, as\nEdward had described; and the clack of their tongues came down the\nbreeze like the busy pipe of starlings on a bright March morning.\n\n“What DO they talk about, Charlotte?” I inquired, wishing to pacify\nEdward. “You go out with them sometimes.”\n\n“I don’t know,” said poor Charlotte, dolefully. “They make me walk\nbehind, ‘cos they say I’m too little, and mustn’t hear. And I DO want to\nso,” she added.\n\n“When any lady comes to see Aunt Eliza,” said Harold, “they both talk\nat once all the time. And yet each of ‘em seems to hear what the other\none’s saying. I can’t make out how they do it. Grown-up people are so\nclever!”\n\n“The Curate’s the funniest man,” I remarked. “He’s always saying things\nthat have no sense in them at all, and then laughing at them as if they\nwere jokes. Yesterday, when they asked him if he’d have some more tea\nhe said ‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,’ and\nthen sniggered all over. I didn’t see anything funny in that. And then\nsomebody asked him about his button-hole and he said ‘’Tis but a little\nfaded flower,’ and exploded again. I thought it very stupid.”\n\n“O HIM,” said Edward contemptuously: “he can’t help it, you know; it’s a\nsort of way he’s got. But it’s these girls I can’t make out. If they’ve\nanything really sensible to talk about, how is it nobody knows what it\nis? And if they haven’t--and we know they CAN’T have, naturally--why\ndon’t they shut up their jaw? This old rabbit here--HE doesn’t want to\ntalk. He’s got something better to do.” And Edward aimed a ginger-beer\ncork at the unruffled beast, who never budged.\n\n“O but rabbits DO talk,” interposed Harold. “I’ve watched them often\nin their hutch. They put their heads together and their noses go up and\ndown, just like Selina’s and the Vicarage girls’. Only of course I can t\nhear what they’re saying.”\n\n“Well, if they do,” said Edward, unwillingly, “I’ll bet they don’t talk\nsuch rot as those girls do!”--which was ungenerous, as well as unfair;\nfor it had not yet transpired--nor has it to this day--WHAT Selina and\nher friends talked about.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. THE ARGONAUTS\n\nThe advent of strangers, of whatever sort, into our circle, had always\nbeen a matter of grave dubiety and suspicion; indeed, it was generally\na signal for retreat into caves and fastnesses of the earth, into\nunthreaded copses or remote outlying cowsheds, whence we were only to be\nextricated by wily nursemaids, rendered familiar by experience with our\nsecret runs and refuges. It was not surprising therefore that the heroes\nof classic legend, when first we made their acquaintance, failed to win\nour entire sympathy at once. “Confidence,” says somebody, “is a plant of\nslow growth;” and these stately dark-haired demi-gods, with names\nhard to master and strange accoutrements, had to win a citadel already\nstrongly garrisoned with a more familiar soldiery. Their chill foreign\ngoddesses had no such direct appeal for us as the mocking malicious\nfairies and witches of the North; we missed the pleasant alliance of\nthe animal--the fox who spread the bushiest of tails to convey us to\nthe enchanted castle, the frog in the well, the raven who croaked advice\nfrom the tree; and--to Harold especially--it seemed entirely wrong that\nthe hero should ever be other than the youngest brother of three. This\nbelief, indeed, in the special fortune that ever awaited the youngest\nbrother, as such,--the “Borough-English” of Faery,--had been of baleful\neffect on Harold, producing a certain self-conceit and perkiness that\ncalled for physical correction. But even in our admonishment we were on\nhis side; and as we distrustfully eyed these new arrivals, old Saturn\nhimself seemed something of a parvenu. Even strangers, however, we\nmay develop into sworn comrades; and these gay swordsmen, after all,\nwere of the right stuff. Perseus, with his cap of darkness and his\nwonderful sandals, was not long in winging his way to our hearts; Apollo\nknocked at Admetus’ gate in something of the right fairy fashion; Psyche\nbrought with her an orthodox palace of magic, as well as helpful birds\nand friendly ants. Ulysses, with his captivating shifts and strategies,\nbroke down the final barrier, and hence forth the band was adopted and\nadmitted into our freemasonry.  I had been engaged in chasing Farmer\nLarkin’s calves--his special pride--round the field, just to show the\nman we hadn’t forgotten him, and was returning through the\nkitchen-garden with a conscience at peace with all men, when I happened\nupon Edward, grubbing for worms in the dung-heap. Edward put his worms\ninto his hat, and we strolled along together, discussing high matters of\nstate. As we reached the tool-shed, strange noises arrested our steps;\nlooking in, we perceived Harold, alone, rapt, absorbed, immersed in the\nspecial game of the moment. He was squatting in an old pig-trough that\nhad been brought in to be tinkered; and as he rhapsodised, anon he waved\na shovel over his head, anon dug it into the ground with the action of\nthose who would urge Canadian canoes. Edward strode in upon him.\n\n“What rot are you playing at now?” he demanded sternly.\n\nHarold flushed up, but stuck to his pig-trough like a man.\n“I’m Jason,” he replied, defiantly; “and this is the Argo. The other\nfellows are here too, only you can’t see them; and we’re just going\nthrough the Hellespont, so don’t you come bothering.” And once more he\nplied the wine-dark sea.\n\nEdward kicked the pig-trough contemptuously.\n\n“Pretty sort of Argo you’ve got!” said he.\n\nHarold began to get annoyed. “I can’t help it,” he replied. “It’s the\nbest sort of Argo I can manage, and it’s all right if you only pretend\nenough; but YOU never could pretend one bit.”\n\nEdward reflected. “Look here,” he said presently; “why shouldn’t we get\nhold of Farmer Larkin’s boat, and go right away up the river in a real\nArgo, and look for Medea, and the Golden Fleece, and everything? And\nI’ll tell you what, I don’t mind your being Jason, as you thought of it\nfirst.”\n\nHarold tumbled out of the trough in the excess of his emotion. “But we\naren’t allowed to go on the water by ourselves,” he cried.\n\n“No,” said Edward, with fine scorn: “we aren’t allowed; and Jason wasn’t\nallowed either, I daresay--but he WENT!”\n\nHarold’s protest had been merely conventional: he only wanted to be\nconvinced by sound argument. The next question was, How about the girls?\nSelina was distinctly handy in a boat: the difficulty about her was,\nthat if she disapproved of the expedition--and, morally considered, it\nwas not exactly a Pilgrim’s Progress--she might go and tell; she\nhaving just reached that disagreeable age when one begins to develop a\nconscience. Charlotte, for her part, had a habit of day-dreams, and was\nas likely as not to fall overboard in one of her rapt musings. To be\nsure, she would dissolve in tears when she found herself left out; but\neven that was better than a watery tomb. In fine, the public voice--and\nrightly, perhaps--was against the admission of the skirted animal: spite\nthe precedent of Atalanta, who was one of the original crew.\n\n“And now,” said Edward, “who’s to ask Farmer Larkin? I can’t; last time\nI saw him he said when he caught me again he’d smack my head. YOU’LL\nhave to.”\n\nI hesitated, for good reasons. “You know those precious calves of his?”\n I began.\n\nEdward understood at once. “All right,” he said; “then we won’t ask him\nat all. It doesn’t much matter. He’d only be annoyed, and that would be\na pity. Now let’s set off.”\n\nWe made our way down to the stream, and captured the farmer’s boat\nwithout let or hindrance, the enemy being engaged in the hayfields. This\n“river,” so called, could never be discovered by us in any atlas; indeed\nour Argo could hardly turn in it without risk of shipwreck. But to us ‘t\nwas Orinoco, and the cities of the world dotted its shores. We put the\nArgo’s head up stream, since that led away from the Larkin province;\nHarold was faithfully permitted to be Jason, and we shared the rest of\nthe heroes among us. Then launching forth from Thessaly, we threaded\nthe Hellespont with shouts, breathlessly dodged the Clashing Rocks, and\ncoasted under the lee of the Siren-haunted isles. Lemnos was fringed\nwith meadow-sweet, dog-roses dotted the Mysian shore, and the cheery\ncall of the haymaking folk sounded along the coast of Thrace.\n\nAfter some hour or two’s seafaring, the prow of the Argo embedded itself\nin the mud of a landing-place, plashy with the tread of cows and giving\non to a lane that led towards the smoke of human habitations. Edward\njumped ashore, alert for exploration, and strode off without waiting\nto see if we followed; but I lingered behind, having caught sight of\na moss-grown water-gate hard by, leading into a garden that from\nthe brooding quiet lapping it round, appeared to portend magical\npossibilities.\n\nIndeed the very air within seemed stiller, as we circumspectly passed\nthrough the gate; and Harold hung back shamefaced, as if we were\ncrossing the threshold of some private chamber, and ghosts of old days\nwere hustling past us. Flowers there were, everywhere; but they drooped\nand sprawled in an overgrowth hinting at indifference; the scent of\nheliotrope possessed the place, as if actually hung in solid festoons\nfrom tall untrimmed hedge to hedge. No basket-chairs, shawls, or novels\ndotted the lawn with colour; and on the garden-front of the house\nbehind, the blinds were mostly drawn. A grey old sun-dial dominated the\ncentral sward, and we moved towards it instinctively, as the most human\nthing visible. An antique motto ran round it, and with eyes and fingers\nwe struggled at the decipherment.\n\n“TIME: TRYETH: TROTHE:” spelt out Harold at last. “I wonder what that\nmeans?”\n\nI could not enlighten him, nor meet his further questions as to the\ninner mechanism of the thing, and where you wound it up.\n\nI had seen these instruments before, of course, but had never fully\nunderstood their manner of working.\n\nWe were still puzzling our heads over the contrivance, when I became\naware that Medea herself was moving down the path from the house.\nDark-haired, supple, of a figure lightly poised and swayed, but pale and\nlistless--I knew her at once, and having come out to find her, naturally\nfelt no surprise at all. But Harold, who was trying to climb on the top\nof the sun-dial, having a cat-like fondness for the summit of things,\nstarted and fell prone, barking his chin and filling the pleasance with\nlamentation.\n\nMedea skimmed the ground swallow-like, and in a moment was on her knees\ncomforting him,--wiping the dirt out of his chin with her own dainty\nhandkerchief,--and vocal with soft murmur of consolation.\n\n“You needn’t take on so about him,” I observed, politely. “He’ll cry for\njust one minute, and then he’ll be all right.”\n\nMy estimate was justified. At the end of his regulation time Harold\nstopped crying suddenly, like a clock that had struck its hour; and with\na serene and cheerful countenance wriggled out of Medea’s embrace, and\nran for a stone to throw at an intrusive blackbird.\n\n“O you boys!” cried Medea, throwing wide her arms with abandonment.\n“Where have you dropped from? How dirty you are! I’ve been shut up here\nfor a thousand years, and all that time I’ve never seen any one under a\nhundred and fifty! Let’s play at something, at once!”\n\n“Rounders is a good game,” I suggested. “Girls can play at rounders. And\nwe could serve up to the sun-dial here. But you want a bat and a ball,\nand some more people.”\n\nShe struck her hands together tragically. “I haven’t a bat,” she cried,\n“or a ball, or more people, or anything sensible whatever. Never mind;\nlet’s play at hide-and-seek in the kitchen garden. And we’ll race there,\nup to that walnut-tree; I haven’t run for a century!”\n\nShe was so easy a victor, nevertheless, that I began to doubt, as I\npanted behind, whether she had not exaggerated her age by a year or two.\nShe flung herself into hide-and-seek with all the gusto and abandonment\nof the true artist, and as she flitted away and reappeared, flushed and\nlaughing divinely, the pale witch-maiden seemed to fall away from her,\nand she moved rather as that other girl I had read about, snatched from\nfields of daffodil to reign in shadow below, yet permitted once again to\nvisit earth, and light, and the frank, caressing air.\n\nTired at last, we strolled back to the old sundial, and Harold, who\nnever relinquished a problem unsolved, began afresh, rubbing his finger\nalong the faint incisions, “Time tryeth trothe. Please, I want to know\nwhat that means.”\n\nMedea’s face drooped low over the sun-dial, till it was almost hidden in\nher fingers. “That’s what I’m here for,” she said presently, in quite a\nchanged, low voice. “They shut me up here--they think I’ll forget--but\nI never will--never, never! And he, too--but I don’t know--it is so\nlong--I don’t know!”\n\nHer face was quite hidden now. There was silence again in the old\ngarden. I felt clumsily helpless and awkward; beyond a vague idea of\nkicking Harold, nothing remedial seemed to suggest itself.\n\nNone of us had noticed the approach of another she-creature--one of the\nangular and rigid class--how different from our dear comrade! The years\nMedea had claimed might well have belonged to her; she wore mittens,\ntoo--a trick I detested in woman. “Lucy!” she said, sharply, in a tone\nwith AUNT writ large over it; and Medea started up guiltily.\n\n“You’ve been crying,” said the newcomer, grimly regarding her through\nspectacles. “And pray who are these exceedingly dirty little boys?”\n\n“Friends of mine, aunt,” said Medea, promptly, with forced cheerfulness.\n“I--I’ve known them a long time. I asked them to come.”\n\nThe aunt sniffed suspiciously. “You must come indoors, dear,” she said,\n“and lie down. The sun will give you a headache. And you little boys had\nbetter run away home to your tea. Remember, you should not come to pay\nvisits without your nursemaid.”\n\nHarold had been tugging nervously at my jacket for some time, and I only\nwaited till Medea turned and kissed a white hand to us as she was\nled away. Then I ran. We gained the boat in safety; and “What an old\ndragon!” said Harold.\n\n“Wasn’t she a beast!” I replied. “Fancy the sun giving any one a\nheadache! But Medea was a real brick. Couldn’t we carry her off?”\n\n“We could if Edward was here,” said Harold, confidently.\n\nThe question was, What had become of that defaulting hero? We were\nnot left long in doubt. First, there came down the lane the shrill and\nwrathful clamour of a female tongue, then Edward, running his best, and\nthen an excited woman hard on his heel. Edward tumbled into the bottom\nof the boat, gasping, “Shove her off!” And shove her off we did,\nmightily, while the dame abused us from the bank in the self same\naccents in which Alfred hurled defiance at the marauding Dane.\n\n“That was just like a bit out of Westward Ho!” I remarked approvingly,\nas we sculled down the stream. “But what had you been doing to her?”\n\n“Hadn’t been doing anything,” panted Edward, still breathless. “I went\nup into the village and explored, and it was a very nice one, and the\npeople were very polite. And there was a blacksmith’s forge there, and\nthey were shoeing horses, and the hoofs fizzled and smoked, and smelt so\njolly! I stayed there quite a long time. Then I got thirsty, so I asked\nthat old woman for some water, and while she was getting it her cat came\nout of the cottage, and looked at me in a nasty sort of way, and\nsaid something I didn’t like. So I went up to it just to--to teach it\nmanners, and somehow or other, next minute it was up an apple-tree,\nspitting, and I was running down the lane with that old thing after me.”\n\nEdward was so full of his personal injuries that there was no\ninteresting him in Medea at all. Moreover, the evening was closing in,\nand it was evident that this cutting-out expedition must be kept for\nanother day. As we neared home, it gradually occurred to us that perhaps\nthe greatest danger was yet to come; for the farmer must have missed\nhis boat ere now, and would probably be lying in wait for us near the\nlanding-place. There was no other spot admitting of debarcation on\nthe home side; if we got out on the other, and made for the bridge,\nwe should certainly be seen and cut off. Then it was that I blessed my\nstars that our elder brother was with us that day,--he might be little\ngood at pretending, but in grappling with the stern facts of life he\nhad no equal. Enjoining silence, he waited till we were but a little\nway from the fated landing-place, and then brought us in to the\nopposite bank. We scrambled out noiselessly, and--the gathering darkness\nfavouring us--crouched behind a willow, while Edward pushed off the\nempty boat with his foot. The old Argo, borne down by the gentle\ncurrent, slid and grazed along the rushy bank; and when she came\nopposite the suspected ambush, a stream of imprecation told us that\nour precaution had not been wasted. We wondered, as we listened, where\nFarmer Larkin, who was bucolically bred and reared, had acquired such\nrange and wealth of vocabulary. Fully realising at last that his boat\nwas derelict, abandoned, at the mercy of wind and wave,--as well as out\nof his reach,--he strode away to the bridge, about a quarter of a mile\nfurther down; and as soon as we heard his boots clumping on the planks,\nwe nipped out, recovered the craft, pulled across, and made the faithful\nvessel fast to her proper moorings. Edward was anxious to wait and\nexchange courtesies and compliments with the disappointed farmer,\nwhen he should confront us on the opposite bank; but wiser counsels\nprevailed. It was possible that the piracy was not yet laid at our\nparticular door: Ulysses, I reminded him, had reason to regret a similar\nact of bravado, and--were he here--would certainly advise a timely\nretreat. Edward held but a low opinion of me as a counsellor; but he had\na very solid respect for Ulysses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. THE ROMAN ROAD\n\nALL the roads of our neighbourhood were cheerful and friendly, having\neach of them pleasant qualities of their own; but this one seemed\ndifferent from the others in its masterful suggestion of a serious\npurpose, speeding you along with a strange uplifting of the heart. The\nothers tempted chiefly with their treasures of hedge and ditch; the rapt\nsurprise of the first lords-and-ladies, the rustle of a field-mouse,\nsplash of a frog; while cool noses of brother-beasts were pushed at you\nthrough gate or gap. A loiterer you had need to be, did you choose one\nof them,--so many were the tiny hands thrust out to detain you, from\nthis side and that. But this other was of a sterner sort, and even in\nits shedding off of bank and hedgerow as it marched straight and full\nfor the open downs, it seemed to declare its contempt for adventitious\ntrappings to catch the shallow-pated. When the sense of injustice or\ndisappointment was heavy on me, and things were very black within, as\non this particular day, the road of character was my choice for that\nsolitary ramble, when I turned my back for an afternoon on a world that\nhad unaccountably declared itself against me.\n\n“The Knights’ Road,” we children had named it, from a sort of feeling\nthat, if from any quarter at all, it would be down this track we\nmight some day see Lancelot and his peers come pacing on their great\nwar-horses,--supposing that any of the stout band still survived, in\nnooks and unexplored places. Grown-up people sometimes spoke of it as\nthe “Pilgrims’ Way”; but I didn’t know much about pilgrims,--except\nWalter in the Horselberg story. Him I sometimes saw, breaking with\nhaggard eyes out of yonder copse, and calling to the pilgrims as they\nhurried along on their desperate march to the Holy City, where peace and\npardon were awaiting them. “All roads lead to Rome,” I had once heard\nsomebody say; and I had taken the remark very seriously, of course,\nand puzzled over it many days. There must have been some mistake, I\nconcluded at last; but of one road at least I intuitively felt it to\nbe true. And my belief was clinched by something that fell from Miss\nSmedley during a history lesson, about a strange road that ran right\ndown the middle of England till it reached the coast, and then began\nagain in France, just opposite, and so on undeviating, through city\nand vineyard, right from the misty Highlands to the Eternal City.\nUncorroborated, any statement of Miss Smedley’s usually fell on\nincredulous ears; but here, with the road itself in evidence, she\nseemed, once, in a way, to have strayed into truth.\n\nRome! It was fascinating to think that it lay at the other end of this\nwhite ribbon that rolled itself off from my feet over the distant downs.\nI was not quite so uninstructed as to imagine l could reach it\nthat afternoon; but some day, I thought, if things went on being as\nunpleasant as they were now,--some day, when Aunt Eliza had gone on a\nvisit,--we would see.\n\nI tried to imagine what it would be like when I got there. The Coliseum\nI knew, of course, from a woodcut in the history-book: so to begin with\nI plumped that down in the middle. The rest had to be patched up from\nthe little grey market-town where twice a year we went to have our hair\ncut; hence, in the result, Vespasian’s amphitheatre was approached\nby muddy little streets, wherein the Red Lion and the Blue Boar, with\nSomebody’s Entire along their front, and “Commercial Room” on their\nwindows; the doctor’s house, of substantial red-brick; and the facade\nof the New Wesleyan Chapel, which we thought very fine, were the chief\narchitectural ornaments: while the Roman populace pottered about in\nsmocks and corduroys, twisting the tails of Roman calves and inviting\neach other to beer in musical Wessex. From Rome I drifted on to other\ncities, dimly heard of--Damascus, Brighton (Aunt Eliza’s ideal), Athens,\nand Glasgow, whose glories the gardener sang; but there was a certain\nsameness in my conception of all of them: that Wesleyan chapel would\nkeep cropping up everywhere. It was easier to go a-building among\nthose dream-cities where no limitations were imposed, and one was sole\narchitect, with a free hand. Down a delectable street of cloud-built\npalaces I was mentally pacing, when I happened upon the Artist.\n\nHe was seated at work by the roadside, at a point whence the cool large\nspaces of the downs, juniper-studded, swept grandly westwards. His\nattributes proclaimed him of the artist tribe: besides, he wore\nknickerbockers like myself,--a garb confined, I was aware, to boys and\nartists. I knew I was not to bother him with questions, nor look over\nhis shoulder and breathe in his ear--they didn’t like it, this\ngenus irritabile; but there was nothing about staring in my code of\ninstructions, the point having somehow been overlooked: so, squatting\ndown on the grass, I devoted myself to a passionate absorbing of every\ndetail. At the end of five minutes there was not a button on him that I\ncould not have passed an examination in; and the wearer himself of that\nhomespun suit was probably less familiar with its pattern and texture\nthan I was. Once he looked up, nodded, half held out his tobacco\npouch,--mechanically, as it were,--then, returning it to his pocket,\nresumed his work, and I my mental photography.\n\nAfter another five minutes or so had passed he remarked, without looking\nmy way: “Fine afternoon we’re having: going far to-day?”\n\n“No, I’m not going any farther than this,” I replied; “I WAS thinking of\ngoing on to Rome but I’ve put it off.”\n\n“Pleasant place, Rome,” he murmured; “you’ll like it.” It was some\nminutes later that he added: “But I wouldn’t go just now, if I were\nyou,--too jolly hot.”\n\n“YOU haven’t been to Rome, have you?” I inquired.\n\n“Rather,” he replied, briefly; “I live there.”\n\nThis was too much, and my jaw dropped as I struggled to grasp the fact\nthat I was sitting there talking to a fellow who lived in Rome. Speech\nwas out of the question: besides, I had other things to do. Ten solid\nminutes had I already spent in an examination of him as a mere stranger\nand artist; and now the whole thing had to be done over again, from the\nchanged point of view. So I began afresh, at the crown of his soft\nhat, and worked down to his solid British shoes, this time investing\neverything with the new Roman halo; and at last I managed to get out:\n“But you don’t really live there, do you?” never doubting the fact, but\nwanting to hear it repeated.\n\n“Well,” he said, good-naturedly overlooking the slight rudeness of my\nquery, “I live there as much as l live anywhere,--about half the year\nsometimes. I’ve got a sort of a shanty there. You must come and see it\nsome day.”\n\n“But do you live anywhere else as well?” I went on, feeling the\nforbidden tide of questions surging up within me.\n\n“O yes, all over the place,” was his vague reply. “And I’ve got a\ndiggings somewhere off Piccadilly.”\n\n“Where’s that?” I inquired.\n\n“Where’s what?” said he. “Oh, Piccadilly! It’s in London.”\n\n“Have you a large garden?” I asked; “and how many pigs have you got?”\n\n“I’ve no garden at all,” he replied, sadly, “and they don’t allow me to\nkeep pigs, though I’d like to, awfully. It’s very hard.”\n\n“But what do you do all day, then,” I cried, “and where do you go and\nplay, without any garden, or pigs, or things?”\n\n“When I want to play,” he said, gravely, “I have to go and play in the\nstreet; but it’s poor fun, I grant you. There’s a goat, though, not far\noff, and sometimes I talk to him when I’m feeling lonely; but he’s very\nproud.”\n\n“Goats ARE proud,” I admitted. “There’s one lives near here, and if you\nsay anything to him at all, he hits you in the wind with his head. You\nknow what it feels like when a fellow hits you in the wind?”\n\n“I do, well,” he replied, in a tone of proper melancholy, and painted\non.\n\n“And have you been to any other places,” I began again, presently,\n“besides Rome and Piccy-what’s-his-name?”\n\n“Heaps,” he said. “I’m a sort of Ulysses--seen men and cities, you know.\nIn fact, about the only place I never got to was the Fortunate Island.”\n\nI began to like this man. He answered your questions briefly and to the\npoint, and never tried to be funny. I felt I could be confidential with\nhim.\n\n“Wouldn’t you like,” I inquired, “to find a city without any people in\nit at all?”\n\nHe looked puzzled. “I’m afraid I don’t quite understand,” said he.\n\n“I mean,” I went on eagerly, “a city where you walk in at the gates, and\nthe shops are all full of beautiful things, and the houses furnished as\ngrand as can be, and there isn’t anybody there whatever! And you go into\nthe shops, and take anything you want--chocolates and magic lanterns and\ninjirubber balls--and there’s nothing to pay; and you choose your own\nhouse and live there and do just as you like, and never go to bed unless\nyou want to!”\n\nThe artist laid down his brush. “That WOULD be a nice city,” he said.\n“Better than Rome. You can’t do that sort of thing in Rome,--or in\nPiccadilly either. But I fear it’s one of the places I’ve never been\nto.”\n\n“And you’d ask your friends,” I went on, warming to my subject,--“only\nthose you really like, of course,--and they’d each have a house to\nthemselves,--there’d be lots of houses,--and no relations at all, unless\nthey promised they’d be pleasant, and if they weren’t they’d have to\ngo.”\n\n“So you wouldn’t have any relations?” said the artist. “Well, perhaps\nyou’re right. We have tastes in common, I see.”\n\n“I’d have Harold,” I said, reflectively, “and Charlotte. They’d like\nit awfully. The others are getting too old. Oh, and Martha--I’d have\nMartha, to cook and wash up and do things. You’d like Martha. She’s ever\nso much nicer than Aunt Eliza. She’s my idea of a real lady.”\n\n“Then I’m sure I should like her,” he replied, heartily, “and when I\ncome to--what do you call this city of yours? Nephelo--something, did\nyou say?”\n\n“I--I don’t know,” I replied, timidly. “I’m afraid it hasn’t got a\nname--yet.”\n\nThe artist gazed out over the downs. “‘The poet says, dear city of\nCecrops;’” he said, softly, to himself, “‘and wilt not thou say, dear\ncity of Zeus?’ That’s from Marcus Aurelius,” he went on, turning again\nto his work. “You don’t know him, I suppose; you will some day.”\n\n“Who’s he?” I inquired.\n\n“Oh, just another fellow who lived in Rome,” he replied, dabbing away.\n\n“O dear!” I cried, disconsolately. “What a lot of people seem to live\nat Rome, and I’ve never even been there! But I think I’d like MY city\nbest.”\n\n“And so would I,” he replied with unction. “But Marcus Aurelius\nwouldn’t, you know.”\n\n“Then we won’t invite him,” I said, “will we?”\n\n“_I_ won’t if you won’t,” said he. And that point being settled, we were\nsilent for a while.\n\n“Do you know,” he said, presently, “I’ve met one or two fellows from\ntime to time who have been to a city like yours,--perhaps it was the\nsame one. They won’t talk much about it--only broken hints, now and\nthen; but they’ve been there sure enough. They don’t seem to care about\nanything in particular--and every thing’s the same to them, rough or\nsmooth; and sooner or later they slip off and disappear; and you never\nsee them again. Gone back, I suppose.”\n\n“Of course,” said I. “Don’t see what they ever came away for; _I_\nwouldn’t,--to be told you’ve broken things when you haven’t, and stopped\nhaving tea with the servants in the kitchen, and not allowed to have a\ndog to sleep with you. But _I’ve_ known people, too, who’ve gone there.”\n\nThe artist stared, but without incivility.\n\n“Well, there’s Lancelot,” I went on. “The book says he died, but it\nnever seemed to read right, somehow. He just went away, like Arthur. And\nCrusoe, when he got tired of wearing clothes and being respectable. And\nall the nice men in the stones who don’t marry the Princess, ‘cos only\none man ever gets married in a book, you know. They’ll be there!”\n\n“And the men who never come off,” he said, “who try like the rest, but\nget knocked out, or somehow miss,--or break down or get bowled over in\nthe melee,--and get no Princess, nor even a second-class kingdom,--some\nof them’ll be there, I hope?”\n\n“Yes, if you like,” I replied, not quite understanding him; “if they’re\nfriends of yours, we’ll ask ‘em, of course.”\n\n“What a time we shall have!” said the artist, reflectively; “and how\nshocked old Marcus Aurelius will be!”\n\nThe shadows had lengthened uncannily, a tide of golden haze was flooding\nthe grey-green surface of the downs, and the artist began to put his\ntraps together, preparatory to a move. I felt very low; we would have\nto part, it seemed, just as we were getting on so well together. Then he\nstood up, and he was very straight and tall, and the sunset was in his\nhair and beard as he stood there, high over me. He took my hand like an\nequal. “I’ve enjoyed our conversation very much,” he said. “That was an\ninteresting subject you started, and we haven’t half exhausted it. We\nshall meet again, I hope.”\n\n“Of course we shall,” I replied, surprised that there should be any\ndoubt about it.\n\n“In Rome, perhaps?” said he.\n\n“Yes, in Rome,” I answered, “or Piccy-the-other-place, or somewhere.”\n\n“Or else,” said he, “in that other city,--when we’ve found the way\nthere. And I’ll look out for you, and you’ll sing out as soon as you see\nme. And we’ll go down the street arm-in-arm, and into all the shops, and\nthen I’ll choose my house, and you’ll choose your house, and we’ll live\nthere like princes and good fellows.”\n\n“Oh, but you’ll stay in my house, won’t you?” I cried; “wouldn’t ask\neverybody; but I’ll ask YOU.”\n\nHe affected to consider a moment; then “Right!” he said: “I believe you\nmean it, and I WILL come and stay with you. I won’t go to anybody else,\nif they ask me ever so much. And I’ll stay quite a long time, too, and I\nwon’t be any trouble.”\n\nUpon this compact we parted, and I went down-heartedly from the man who\nunderstood me, back to the house where I never could do anything right.\nHow was it that everything seemed natural and sensible to him, which\nthese uncles, vicars, and other grown-up men took for the merest\ntomfoolery? Well, he would explain this, and many another thing, when we\nmet again. The Knights’ Road! How it always brought consolation! Was he\npossibly one of those vanished knights I had been looking for so long?\nPerhaps he would be in armour next time,--why not? He would look well in\narmour, I thought. And I would take care to get there first, and see the\nsunlight flash and play on his helmet and shield, as he rode up the High\nStreet of the Golden City.\n\nMeantime, there only remained the finding it,--an easy matter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. THE SECRET DRAWER\n\nIT must surely have served as a boudoir for the ladies of old time,\nthis little used, rarely entered chamber where the neglected old bureau\nstood. There was something very feminine in the faint hues of its faded\nbrocades, in the rose and blue of such bits of china as yet remained,\nand in the delicate old-world fragrance of pot-pourri from the great\nbowl--blue and white, with funny holes in its cover--that stood on\nthe bureau’s flat top. Modern aunts disdained this out-of-the-way,\nback-water, upstairs room, preferring to do their accounts and grapple\nwith their correspondence in some central position more in the whirl of\nthings, whence one eye could be kept on the carriage drive, while the\nother was alert for malingering servants and marauding children. Those\naunts of a former generation--I sometimes felt--would have suited our\nhabits better. But even by us children, to whom few places were private\nor reserved, the room was visited but rarely. To be sure, there was\nnothing particular in it that we coveted or required,--only a few\nspindle-legged gilt-backed chairs; an old harp, on which, so the\nlegend ran, Aunt Eliza herself used once to play, in years remote,\nunchronicled; a corner-cupboard with a few pieces of china; and the old\nbureau. But one other thing the room possessed, peculiar to itself; a\ncertain sense of privacy,--a power of making the intruder feel that he\nWAS intruding,--perhaps even a faculty of hinting that some one might\nhave been sitting on those chairs, writing at the bureau, or fingering\nthe china, just a second before one entered.\n\nNo such violent word as “haunted” could possibly apply to this pleasant\nold-fashioned chamber, which indeed we all rather liked; but there was\nno doubt it was reserved and stand-offish, keeping itself to itself.\n\nUncle Thomas was the first to draw my attention to the possibilities of\nthe old bureau. He was pottering about the house one afternoon, having\nordered me to keep at his heels for company,--he was a man who hated to\nbe left one minute alone,--when his eye fell on it. “H’m! Sheraton!” he\nremarked. (He had a smattering of most things, this uncle, especially\nthe vocabularies.) Then he let down the flap, and examined the empty\npigeon-holes and dusty panelling. “Fine bit of inlay,” he went on:\n“good work, all of it. I know the sort. There’s a secret drawer in there\nsomewhere.” Then, as I breathlessly drew near, he suddenly exclaimed:\n“By Jove, I do want to smoke!” and wheeling round he abruptly fled for\nthe garden, leaving me with the cup dashed from my lips. What a strange\nthing, I mused, was this smoking, that takes a man suddenly, be he in\nthe court, the camp, or the grove, grips him like an Afreet, and whirls\nhim off to do its imperious behests! Would it be even so with myself, I\nwondered, in those unknown grown-up years to come?\n\nBut I had no time to waste in vain speculations. My whole being was\nstill vibrating to those magic syllables, “secret drawer;” and that\nparticular chord had been touched that never fails to thrill responsive\nto such words as CAVE, TRAP-DOOR, SLIDING-PANEL, BULLION, INGOTS, or\nSPANISH DOLLARS. For, besides its own special bliss, who ever heard of\na secret drawer with nothing in it? And oh, I did want money so badly!\nI mentally ran over the list of demands which were pressing me the most\nimperiously.\n\nFirst, there was the pipe I wanted to give George Jannaway. George, who\nwas Martha’s young man, was a shepherd, and a great ally of mine; and\nthe last fair he was at, when he bought his sweetheart fairings, as a\nright-minded shepherd should, he had purchased a lovely snake expressly\nfor me; one of the wooden sort, with joints, waggling deliciously in the\nhand; with yellow spots on a green ground, sticky and strong-smelling,\nas a fresh-painted snake ought to be; and with a red-flannel tongue,\npasted cunningly into its jaws. I loved it much, and took it to bed with\nme every night, till what time its spinal cord was loosed and it fell\napart, and went the way of all mortal joys. I thought it so nice of\nGeorge to think of me at the fair, and that’s why I wanted to give him\na pipe. When the young year was chill and lambing-time was on, George\ninhabited a little wooden house on wheels, far out on the wintry downs,\nand saw no faces but such as were sheepish and woolly and mute; ant when\nhe and Martha were married, she was going to carry his dinner out to him\nevery day, two miles; and after it, perhaps he would smoke my pipe. It\nseemed an idyllic sort of existence, for both the parties concerned;\nbut a pipe of quality, a pipe fitted to be part of a life such as\nthis, could not be procured (so Martha informed me) for a less sum than\neighteen pence. And meantime--!\n\nThen there was the fourpence I owed Edward; not that he was bothering me\nfor it, but I knew he was in need of it himself, to pay back Selina, who\nwanted it to make up a sum of two shillings, to buy Harold an ironclad\nfor his approaching birthday,--H. M. S. Majestic, now lying uselessly\ncareened in the toyshop window, just when her country had such sore need\nof her.\n\nAnd then there was that boy in the village who had caught a young\nsquirrel, and I had never yet possessed one, and he wanted a shilling\nfor it, but I knew that for ninepence in cash--but what was the good of\nthese sorry, threadbare reflections? I had wants enough to exhaust any\npossible find of bullion, even if it amounted to half a sovereign.\nMy only hope now lay in the magic drawer, and here I was standing and\nletting the precious minutes slip by. Whether “findings” of this sort\ncould, morally speaking, be considered “keepings,” was a point that did\nnot occur to me.\n\nThe room was very still as I approached the bureau,--possessed, it\nseemed to be, by a sort of hush of expectation. The faint odour of\norris-root that floated forth as I let down the flap, seemed to identify\nitself with the yellows and browns of the old wood, till hue and scent\nwere of one quality and interchangeable.\n\nEven so, ere this, the pot-pourri had mixed itself with the tints of the\nold brocade, and brocade and pot-pourri had long been one.\n\nWith expectant fingers I explored the empty pigeon-holes and sounded the\ndepths of the softly-sliding drawers. No books that I knew of gave any\ngeneral recipe for a quest like this; but the glory, should I succeed\nunaided, would be all the greater.\n\nTo him who is destined to arrive, the fates never fail to afford, on the\nway, their small encouragements; in less than two minutes, I had come\nacross a rusty button-hook. This was truly magnificent. In the nursery\nthere existed, indeed, a general button-hook, common to either sex;\nbut none of us possessed a private and special button-hook, to lend or\nrefuse as suited the high humour of the moment. I pocketed the treasure\ncarefully and proceeded. At the back of another drawer, three old\nforeign stamps told me I was surely on the highroad to fortune.\n\nFollowing on these bracing incentives, came a dull blank period of\nunrewarded search. In vain I removed all the drawers and felt over every\ninch of the smooth surfaces, from front to back. Never a knob, spring\nor projection met the thrilling finger-tips; unyielding the old bureau\nstood, stoutly guarding its secret, if secret it really had. I began\nto grow weary and disheartened. This was not the first time that Uncle\nThomas had proved shallow, uninformed, a guide into blind alleys where\nthe echoes mocked you. Was it any good persisting longer? Was anything\nany good whatever? In my mind I began to review past disappointments,\nand life seemed one long record of failure and of non-arrival.\nDisillusioned and depressed, I left my work and went to the window.\nThe light was ebbing from the room, and outside seemed to be collecting\nitself on the horizon for its concentrated effort of sunset. Far down\nthe garden, Uncle Thomas was holding Edward in the air reversed, and\nsmacking him. Edward, gurgling hysterically, was striking blind fists in\nthe direction where he judged his uncle’s stomach should rightly be; the\ncontents of his pockets--a motley show--were strewing the lawn. Somehow,\nthough I had been put through a similar performance an hour or two ago,\nmyself, it all seemed very far away and cut off from me.\n\nWestwards the clouds were massing themselves in a low violet bank; below\nthem, to north and south, as far round as eye could reach, a narrow\nstreak of gold ran out and stretched away, straight along the horizon.\nSomewhere very far off, a horn was being blown, clear and thin; it\nsounded like the golden streak grown audible, while the gold seemed\nthe visible sound. It pricked my ebbing courage, this blended strain of\nmusic and colour, and I turned for a last effort; and Fortune thereupon,\nas if half-ashamed of the unworthy game she had been playing with me,\nrelented, opening her clenched fist. Hardly had I put my hand once more\nto the obdurate wood, when with a sort of small sigh, almost a sob--as\nit were--of relief, the secret drawer sprang open.\n\nI drew it out and carried it to the window, to examine it in the failing\nlight. Too hopeless had I gradually grown, in my dispiriting search, to\nexpect very much; and yet at a glance I saw that my basket of glass lay\nin fragments at my feet. No ingots or dollars were here, to crown me the\nlittle Monte Cristo of a week. Outside, the distant horn had ceased its\ngnat-song, the gold was paling to primrose, and everything was lonely\nand still. Within, my confident little castles were tumbling down like\ncard-houses, leaving me stripped of estate, both real and personal, and\ndominated by the depressing reaction.\n\nAnd yet,--as I looked again at the small collection that lay within\nthat drawer of disillusions, some warmth crept back to my heart as I\nrecognised that a kindred spirit to my own had been at the making of it.\nTwo tarnished gilt buttons,--naval, apparently,--a portrait of a monarch\nunknown to me, cut from some antique print and deftly coloured by hand\nin just my own bold style of brush-work,--some foreign copper coins,\nthicker and clumsier of make than those I hoarded myself,--and a list of\nbirds’ eggs, with names of the places where they had been found. Also, a\nferret’s muzzle, and a twist of tarry string, still faintly aromatic. It\nwas a real boy’s hoard, then, that I had happened upon. He too had found\nout the secret drawer, this happy starred young person; and here he had\nstowed away his treasures, one by one, and had cherished them secretly\nawhile; and then--what? Well, one would never know now the reason why\nthese priceless possessions still lay here unreclaimed; but across the\nvoid stretch of years I seemed to touch hands a moment with my little\ncomrade of seasons long since dead.\n\nI restored the drawer, with its contents, to the trusty bureau, and\nheard the spring click with a certain satisfaction. Some other boy,\nperhaps, would some day release that spring again. I trusted he would be\nequally appreciative. As I opened the door to go, I could hear from the\nnursery at the end of the passage shouts and yells, telling that the\nhunt was up. Bears, apparently, or bandits, were on the evening bill of\nfare, judging by the character of the noises. In another minute I would\nbe in the thick of it, in all the warmth and light and laughter. And\nyet--what a long way off it all seemed, both in space and time, to me\nyet lingering on the threshold of that old-world chamber!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. “EXIT TYRANNUS”\n\nThe eventful day had arrived at last, the day which, when first named,\nhad seemed--like all golden dates that promise anything definite--so\nimmeasurably remote. When it was first announced, a fortnight before,\nthat Miss Smedley was really going, the resultant ecstasies had occupied\na full week, during which we blindly revelled in the contemplation and\ndiscussion of her past tyrannies, crimes, malignities; in recalling to\neach other this or that insult, dishonour, or physical assault, sullenly\nendured at a time when deliverance was not even a small star on the\nhorizon; and in mapping out the golden days to come, with special new\ntroubles of their own, no doubt, since this is but a work-a-day world,\nbut at least free from one familiar scourge. The time that remained had\nbeen taken up by the planning of practical expressions of the popular\nsentiment. Under Edward’s masterly direction, arrangements had been made\nfor a flag to be run up over the hen-house at the very moment when the\nfly, with Miss Smedley’s boxes on top and the grim oppressor herself\ninside, began to move off down the drive. Three brass cannons, set on\nthe brow of the sunk-fence, were to proclaim our deathless sentiments\nin the ears of the retreating foe: the dogs were to wear ribbons,\nand later--but this depended on our powers of evasiveness and\ndissimulation--there might be a small bonfire, with a cracker or two, if\nthe public funds could bear the unwonted strain.\n\nI was awakened by Harold digging me in the ribs, and “She’s going\nto-day!” was the morning hymn that scattered the clouds of sleep.\n\nStrange to say, it was with no corresponding jubilation of spirits\nthat I slowly realised the momentous fact. Indeed, as I dressed, a dull\ndisagreeable feeling that I could not define grew within me--something\nlike a physical bruise. Harold was evidently feeling it too, for after\nrepeating “She’s going to-day!” in a tone more befitting the Litany, he\nlooked hard in my face for direction as to how the situation was to be\ntaken. But I crossly bade him look sharp and say his prayers and not\nbother me. What could this gloom portend, that on a day of days like the\npresent seemed to hang my heavens with black?\n\nDown at last and out in the sun, we found Edward before us, swinging on\na gate, and chanting a farm-yard ditty in which all the beasts appear\nin due order, jargoning in their several tongues, and every verse begins\nwith the couplet--\n\n            “Now, my lads, come with me,\n             Out in the morning early!”\n\nThe fateful exodus of the day had evidently slipped his memory entirely.\nI touched him on the shoulder. “She’s going to-day!” I said. Edward’s\ncarol subsided like a water-tap turned off. “So she is!” he replied,\nand got down at once off the gate: and we returned to the house without\nanother word.\n\nAt breakfast Miss Smedley behaved in a most mean and uncalled-for\nmanner. The right divine of governesses to govern wrong includes no\nright to cry. In thus usurping the prerogative of their victims, they\nignore the rules of the ring, and hit below the belt. Charlotte was\ncrying, of course; but that counted for nothing. Charlotte even cried\nwhen the pigs’ noses were ringed in due season; thereby evoking the\ncheery contempt of the operators, who asserted they liked it, and\ndoubtless knew. But when the cloud-compeller, her bolts laid aside,\nresorted to tears, mutinous humanity had a right to feel aggrieved, and\nplaced in a false and difficult position. What would the Romans have\ndone, supposing Hannibal had cried? History has not even considered the\npossibility. Rules and precedents should be strictly observed on both\nsides; when they are violated, the other party is justified in feeling\ninjured.\n\nThere were no lessons that morning, naturally--another grievance!\n\nThe fitness of things required that we should have struggled to the last\nin a confused medley of moods and tenses, and parted for ever, flushed\nwith hatred, over the dismembered corpse of the multiplication table.\nBut this thing was not to be; and I was free to stroll by myself\nthrough the garden, and combat, as best I might, this growing feeling of\ndepression. It was a wrong system altogether, I thought, this going of\npeople one had got used to. Things ought always to continue as they had\nbeen. Change there must be, of course; pigs, for instance, came and went\nwith disturbing frequency--\n\n        “Fired their ringing shot and passed,\n         Hotly charged and sank at last,”--\n\nbut Nature had ordered it so, and in requital had provided for rapid\nsuccessors. Did you come to love a pig, and he was taken from you, grief\nwas quickly assuaged in the delight of selection from the new litter.\nBut now, when it was no question of a peerless pig, but only of a\ngoverness, Nature seemed helpless, and the future held no litter of\noblivion. Things might be better, or they might be worse, but they would\nnever be the same; and the innate conservatism of youth asks neither\npoverty nor riches, but only immunity from change.\n\nEdward slouched up alongside of me presently, with a hang-dog look on\nhim, as if he had been caught stealing jam. “What a lark it’ll be when\nshe’s really gone!” he observed, with a swagger obviously assumed.\n\n“Grand fun!” I replied, dolorously; and conversation flagged.\n\nWe reached the hen-house, and contemplated the banner of freedom lying\nready to flaunt the breezes at the supreme moment.\n\n“Shall you run it up,” I asked, “when the fly starts, or--or wait a\nlittle till it’s out of sight?”\n\nEdward gazed around him dubiously. “We’re going to have some rain, I\nthink,” he said; “and--and it’s a new flag. It would be a pity to spoil\nit. P’raps I won’t run it up at all.”\n\nHarold came round the corner like a bison pursued by Indians. “I’ve\npolished up the cannons,” he cried, “and they look grand! Mayn’t I load\n‘em now?”\n\n“You leave ‘em alone,” said Edward, severely, “or you’ll be blowing\nyourself up” (consideration for others was not usually Edward’s strong\npoint). “Don’t touch the gunpowder till you’re told, or you’ll get your\nhead smacked.”\n\nHarold fell behind, limp, squashed, obedient. “She wants me to write to\nher,” he began, presently. “Says she doesn’t mind the spelling, it I’ll\nonly write. Fancy her saying that!”\n\n“Oh, shut up, will you?” said Edward, savagely; and once more we were\nsilent, with only our thoughts for sorry company.\n\n“Let’s go off to the copse,” I suggested timidly, feeling that something\nhad to be done to relieve the tension, “and cut more new bows and\narrows.”\n\n“She gave me a knife my last birthday,” said Edward, moodily, never\nbudging. “It wasn’t much of a knife--but I wish I hadn’t lost it.”\n\n“When my legs used to ache,” I said, “she sat up half the night, rubbing\nstuff on them. I forgot all about that till this morning.”\n\n“There’s the fly!” cried Harold suddenly. “I can hear it scrunching on\nthe gravel.”\n\nThen for the first time we turned and stared one another in the face.\n\n*****\n\nThe fly and its contents had finally disappeared through the gate: the\nrumble of its wheels had died away; and no flag floated defiantly in\nthe sun, no cannons proclaimed the passing of a dynasty. From out the\nfrosted cake of our existence Fate had cut an irreplaceable segment;\nturn which way we would, the void was present. We sneaked off in\ndifferent directions, mutually undesirous of company; and it seemed\nborne in upon me that I ought to go and dig my garden right over, from\nend to end. It didn’t actually want digging; on the other hand, no\namount of digging could affect it, for good or for evil; so I worked\nsteadily, strenuously, under the hot sun, stifling thought in action. At\nthe end of an hour or so, I was joined by Edward.\n\n“I’ve been chopping up wood,” he explained, in a guilty sort of way,\nthough nobody had called on him to account for his doings.\n\n“What for?” I inquired, stupidly. “There’s piles and piles of it chopped\nup already.”\n\n“I know,” said Edward; “but there’s no harm in having a bit over.\nYou never can tell what may happen. But what have you been doing all\nthis digging for?”\n\n“You said it was going to rain,” I explained, hastily; “so I thought\nI’d get the digging done before it came. Good gardeners always tell you\nthat’s the right thing to do.”\n\n“It did look like rain at one time,” Edward admitted; “but it’s passed\noff now. Very queer weather we’re having. I suppose that’s why I’ve felt\nso funny all day.”\n\n“Yes, I suppose it’s the weather,” I replied. “_I’ve_ been feeling funny\ntoo.”\n\nThe weather had nothing to do with it, as we well knew. But we would\nboth have died rather than have admitted the real reason.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. THE BLUE ROOM\n\nThat nature has her moments of sympathy with man has been noted often\nenough,--and generally as a new discovery; to us, who had never known\nany other condition of things, it seemed entirely right and fitting that\nthe wind sang and sobbed in the poplar tops, and in the lulls of\nit, sudden spirts of rain spattered the already dusty roads, on that\nblusterous March day when Edward and I awaited, on the station platform,\nthe arrival of the new tutor. Needless to say, this arrangement had been\nplanned by an aunt, from some fond idea that our shy, innocent young\nnatures would unfold themselves during the walk from the station, and\nthat on the revelation of each other’s more solid qualities that must\nthen inevitably ensue, an enduring friendship springing from mutual\nrespect might be firmly based. A pretty dream,--nothing more. For\nEdward, who foresaw that the brunt of tutorial oppression would have\nto be borne by him, was sulky, monosyllabic, and determined to be as\nnegatively disagreeable as good manners would permit. It was therefore\nevident that I would have to be spokesman and purveyor of hollow\ncivilities, and I was none the more amiable on that account; all\ncourtesies, welcomes, explanations, and other court-chamberlain kind of\nbusiness, being my special aversion. There was much of the tempestuous\nMarch weather in the hearts of both of us, as we sullenly glowered along\nthe carriage-windows of the slackening train.\n\nOne is apt, however, to misjudge the special difficulties of a\nsituation; and the reception proved, after all, an easy and informal\nmatter. In a trainful so uniformly bucolic, a tutor was readily\nrecognisable; and his portmanteau had been consigned to the\nluggage-cart, and his person conveyed into the lane, before I had\ndischarged one of my carefully considered sentences. I breathed more\neasily, and, looking up at our new friend as we stepped out together,\nremembered that we had been counting on something altogether more\narid, scholastic, and severe. A boyish eager face and a petulant\npince-nez,--untidy hair,--a head of constant quick turns like a robin’s,\nand a voice that kept breaking into alto,--these were all very strange\nand new, but not in the least terrible.\n\nHe proceeded jerkily through the village, with glances on this side and\nthat; and “Charming,” he broke out presently; “quite too charming and\ndelightful!”\n\nI had not counted on this sort of thing, and glanced for help to Edward,\nwho, hands in pockets, looked grimly down his nose. He had taken his\nline, and meant to stick to it.\n\nMeantime our friend had made an imaginary spy-glass out of his fist,\nand was squinting through it at something I could not perceive. “What an\nexquisite bit!” he burst out; “fifteenth century,--no,--yes, it is!”\n\nI began to feel puzzled, not to say alarmed. It reminded me of the\nbutcher in the Arabian Nights, whose common joints, displayed on the\nshop-front, took to a startled public the appearance of dismembered\nhumanity. This man seemed to see the strangest things in our dull,\nfamiliar surroundings.\n\n“Ah!” he broke out again, as we jogged on between hedgerows: “and\nthat field now--backed by the downs--with the rain-cloud brooding over\nit,--that’s all David Cox--every bit of it!”\n\n“That field belongs to Farmer Larkin,” I explained politely, for of\ncourse he could not be expected to know. “I’ll take you over to Farmer\nCox’s to-morrow, if he’s a friend of yours; but there’s nothing to see\nthere.”\n\nEdward, who was hanging sullenly behind, made a face at me, as if to\nsay, “What sort of lunatic have we got here?”\n\n“It has the true pastoral character, this country of yours,” went on our\nenthusiast: “with just that added touch in cottage and farmstead,\nrelics of a bygone art, which makes our English landscape so divine, so\nunique!”\n\nReally this grasshopper was becoming a burden. These familiar fields and\nfarms, of which we knew every blade and stick, had done nothing that\nI knew of to be bespattered with adjectives in this way. I had never\nthought of them as divine, unique, or anything else. They were--well,\nthey were just themselves, and there was an end of it. Despairingly I\njogged Edward in the ribs, as a sign to start rational conversation, but\nhe only grinned and continued obdurate.\n\n“You can see the house now,” I remarked, presently; “and that’s Selina,\nchasing the donkey in the paddock,--or is it the donkey chasing Selina?\nI can’t quite make out; but it’s THEM, anyhow.”\n\nNeedless to say, he exploded with a full charge of adjectives.\n“Exquisite!” he rapped out; “so mellow and harmonious! and so entirely\nin keeping!” (I could see from Edward’s face that he was thinking who\nought to be in keeping.) “Such possibilities of romance, now, in those\nold gables!”\n\n“If you mean the garrets,” I said, “there’s a lot of old furniture\nin them; and one is generally full of apples; and the bats get\nin sometimes, under the eaves, and flop about till we go up with\nhair-brushes and things and drive ‘em out; but there’s nothing else in\nthem that I know of.”\n\n“Oh, but there must be more than bats,” he cried. “Don’t tell me there\nare no ghosts. I shall be deeply disappointed if there aren’t any\nghosts.”\n\nI did not think it worth while to reply, feeling really unequal to this\nsort of conversation; besides, we were nearing the house, when my task\nwould be ended. Aunt Eliza met us at the door, and in the cross-fire of\nadjectives that ensued--both of them talking at once, as grown-up folk\nhave a habit of doing--we two slipped round to the back of the house,\nand speedily put several solid acres between us and civilisation, for\nfear of being ordered in to tea in the drawing-room. By the time we\nreturned, our new importation had gone up to dress for dinner, so till\nthe morrow at least we were free of him.\n\nMeanwhile the March wind, after dropping a while at sundown, had been\nsteadily increasing in volume; and although I fell asleep at my usual\nhour, about midnight I was wakened by the stress and cry of it. In the\nbright moonlight, wind-swung branches tossed and swayed eerily across\nthe blinds; there was rumbling in chimneys, whistling in keyholes, and\neverywhere a clamour and a call. Sleep was out of the question, and,\nsitting up in bed, I looked round. Edward sat up too. “I was wondering\nwhen you were going to wake,” he said. “It’s no good trying to sleep\nthrough this. I vote we get up and do something.”\n\n“I’m game,” I replied. “Let’s play at being in a ship at sea” (the\nplaint of the old house under the buffeting wind suggested this,\nnaturally); “and we can be wrecked on an island, or left on a raft,\nwhichever you choose; but I like an island best myself, because there’s\nmore things on it.”\n\nEdward on reflection negatived the idea. “It would make too much noise,”\n he pointed out. “There’s no fun playing at ships, unless you can make a\njolly good row.”\n\nThe door creaked, and a small figure in white slipped cautiously in.\n“Thought I heard you talking,” said Charlotte. “We don’t like it; we’re\nafraid--Selina too. She’ll be here in a minute. She’s putting on her new\ndressing-gown she’s so proud of.”\n\nHis arms round his knees, Edward cogitated deeply until Selina appeared,\nbarefooted, and looking slim and tall in the new dressing-gown. Then,\n“Look here,” he exclaimed; “now we’re all together, I vote we go and\nexplore!”\n\n“You’re always wanting to explore,” I said. “What on earth is there to\nexplore for in this house?”\n\n“Biscuits!” said the inspired Edward.\n\n“Hooray! Come on!” chimed in Harold, sitting up suddenly. He had been\nawake all the time, but had been shamming asleep, lest he should be\nfagged to do anything.\n\nIt was indeed a fact, as Edward had remembered, that our thoughtless\nelders occasionally left the biscuits out, a prize for the night-walking\nadventurer with nerves of steel.\n\nEdward tumbled out of bed, and pulled a baggy old pair of knickerbockers\nover his bare shanks. Then he girt himself with a belt, into which\nhe thrust, on the one side a large wooden pistol, on the other an\nold single-stick; and finally he donned a big slouch-hat--once\nan uncle’s--that we used for playing Guy Fawkes and Charles-the-Second\nup-a-tree in. Whatever the audience, Edward, if possible, always dressed\nfor his parts with care and conscientiousness; while Harold and I, true\nElizabethans, cared little about the mounting of the piece, so long as\nthe real dramatic heart of it beat sound.\n\nOur commander now enjoined on us a silence deep as the grave, reminding\nus that Aunt Eliza usually slept with an open door, past which we had to\nfile.\n\n“But we’ll take the short cut through the Blue Room,” said the wary\nSelina.\n\n“Of course,” said Edward, approvingly. “I forgot about that. Now then!\nYou lead the way!”\n\nThe Blue Room had in prehistoric times been added to by taking in a\nsuperfluous passage, and so not only had the advantage of two doors, but\nenabled us to get to the head of the stairs without passing the chamber\nwherein our dragon-aunt lay couched. It was rarely occupied, except when\na casual uncle came down for the night. We entered in noiseless file,\nthe room being plunged in darkness, except for a bright strip of\nmoonlight on the floor, across which we must pass for our exit. On this\nour leading lady chose to pause, seizing the opportunity to study the\nhang of her new dressing-gown. Greatly satisfied thereat, she proceeded,\nafter the feminine fashion, to peacock and to pose, pacing a minuet\ndown the moonlit patch with an imaginary partner. This was too much for\nEdward’s histrionic instincts, and after a moment’s pause he drew his\nsingle-stick, and with flourishes meet for the occasion, strode onto the\nstage. A struggle ensued on approved lines, at the end of which Selina\nwas stabbed slowly and with unction, and her corpse borne from the\nchamber by the ruthless cavalier. The rest of us rushed after in a\nclump, with capers and gesticulations of delight; the special charm of\nthe performance lying in the necessity for its being carried out with\nthe dumbest of dumb shows.\n\nOnce out on the dark landing, the noise of the storm without told us\nthat we had exaggerated the necessity for silence; so, grasping the\ntails of each other’s nightgowns even as Alpine climbers rope\nthemselves together in perilous places, we fared stoutly down the\nstaircase-moraine, and across the grim glacier of the hall, to where a\nfaint glimmer from the half-open door of the drawing-room beckoned to\nus like friendly hostel-lights. Entering, we found that our thriftless\nseniors had left the sound red heart of a fire, easily coaxed into a\ncheerful blaze; and biscuits--a plateful--smiled at us in an encouraging\nsort of way, together with the halves of a lemon, already once squeezed\nbut still suckable. The biscuits were righteously shared, the lemon\nsegments passed from mouth to mouth; and as we squatted round the fire,\nits genial warmth consoling our unclad limbs, we realised that so many\nnocturnal perils had not been braved in vain.\n\n“It’s a funny thing,” said Edward, as we chatted, “how; I hate this room\nin the daytime. It always means having your face washed, and your hair\nbrushed, and talking silly company talk. But to-night it’s really quite\njolly. Looks different, somehow.”\n\n“I never can make out,” I said, “what people come here to tea for.\nThey can have their own tea at home if they like,--they’re not poor\npeople,--with jam and things, and drink out of their saucer, and suck\ntheir fingers and enjoy themselves; but they come here from a long way\noff, and sit up straight with their feet off the bars of their chairs,\nand have one cup, and talk the same sort of stuff every time.”\n\nSelina sniffed disdainfully. “You don’t know anything about it,” she\nsaid. “In society you have to call on each other. It’s the proper thing\nto do.”\n\n“Pooh! YOU’RE not in society,” said Edward, politely; “and, what’s more,\nyou never will be.”\n\n“Yes, I shall, some day,” retorted Selina; “but I shan’t ask you to come\nand see me, so there!”\n\n“Wouldn’t come if you did,” growled Edward.\n\n“Well, you won’t get the chance,” rejoined our sister, claiming her\nright of the last word. There was no heat about these little amenities,\nwhich made up--as we understood it--the art of polite conversation.\n\n“I don ‘t like society people,” put in Harold from the sofa, where he\nwas sprawling at full length,--a sight the daylight hours would have\nblushed to witness. “There were some of ‘em here this afternoon, when\nyou two had gone off to the station. Oh, and I found a dead mouse on the\nlawn, and I wanted to skin it, but I wasn’t sure I knew how, by myself;\nand they came out into the garden and patted my head,--I wish people\nwouldn’t do that,--and one of ‘em asked me to pick her a flower. Don’t\nknow why she couldn’t pick it herself; but I said, ‘All right, I will if\nyou’ll hold my mouse.’ But she screamed, and threw it away; and Augustus\n(the cat) got it, and ran away with it. I believe it was really his\nmouse all the time, ‘cos he’d been looking about as if he had lost\nsomething, so I wasn’t angry with HIM; but what did SHE want to throw\naway my mouse for?”\n\n“You have to be careful with mice,” reflected Edward; “they’re such\nslippery things. Do you remember we were playing with a dead mouse once\non the piano, and the mouse was Robinson Crusoe, and the piano was the\nisland, and somehow Crusoe slipped down inside the island, into its\nworks, and we couldn’t get him out, though we tried rakes and all sorts\nof things, till the tuner came. And that wasn’t till a week after, and\nthen--”\n\nHere Charlotte, who had been nodding solemnly, fell over into the\nfender; and we realised that the wind had dropped at last, and the house\nwas lapped in a great stillness. Our vacant beds seemed to be calling\nto us imperiously; and we were all glad when Edward gave the signal\nfor retreat. At the top of the staircase Harold unexpectedly turned\nmutinous, insisting on his right to slide down the banisters in a\nfree country. Circumstances did not allow of argument; I suggested\nfrog’s-marching instead, and frog’s-marched he accordingly was, the\nprocession passing solemnly across the moonlit Blue Room, with Harold\nhorizontal and limply submissive. Snug in bed at last, I was just\nslipping off into slumber when I heard Edward explode, with chuckle and\nsnort.\n\n“By Jove!” he said; “I forgot all about it. The new tutor’s sleeping in\nthe Blue Room!”\n\n“Lucky he didn’t wake up and catch us,” I grunted, drowsily; and both of\nus, without another thought on the matter, sank into well-earned repose.\n\nNext morning we came down to breakfast braced to grapple with fresh\nadversity, but were surprised to find our garrulous friend of the\nprevious day--he was late in making his appearance--strangely silent and\n(apparently) preoccupied. Having polished off our porridge, we ran out\nto feed the rabbits, explaining to them that a beast of a tutor would\nprevent their enjoying so much of our society as formerly.\n\nOn returning to the house at the fated hour appointed for study, we\nwere thunderstruck to see the station-cart disappearing down the\ndrive, freighted with our new acquaintance. Aunt Eliza was brutally\nuncommunicative; but she was overheard to remark casually that she\nthought the man must be a lunatic. In this theory we were only too ready\nto concur, dismissing thereafter the whole matter from our minds.\n\nSome weeks later it happened that Uncle Thomas, while paying us a flying\nvisit, produced from his pocket a copy of the latest weekly, Psyche: a\nJournal of the Unseen; and proceeded laborously to rid himself of\nmuch incomprehensible humour, apparently at our expense. We bore it\npatiently, with the forced grin demanded by convention, anxious to\nget at the source of inspiration, which it presently appeared lay in a\nparagraph circumstantially describing our modest and humdrum habitation.\n“Case III.,” it began. “The following particulars were communicated by\na young member of the Society, of undoubted probity and earnestness,\nand are a chronicle of actual and recent experience.” A fairly accurate\ndescription of the house followed, with details that were unmistakable;\nbut to this there succeeded a flood of meaningless drivel about\napparitions, nightly visitants, and the like, writ in a manner\nbetokening a disordered mind, coupled with a feeble imagination. The\nfellow was not even original. All the old material was there,--the storm\nat night, the haunted chamber, the white lady, the murder re-enacted,\nand so on,--already worn threadbare in many a Christmas Number. No one\nwas able to make head or tail of the stuff, or of its connexion with\nour quiet mansion; and yet Edward, who had always suspected the man,\npersisted in maintaining that our tutor of a brief span was, somehow or\nother, at the bottom of it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16. A FALLING OUT\n\nHarold told me the main facts of this episode some time later,--in bits,\nand with reluctance. It was not a recollection he cared to talk about.\nThe crude blank misery of a moment is apt to leave a dull bruise which\nis slow to depart, if it ever does so entirely; and Harold confesses\nto a twinge or two, still, at times, like the veteran who brings home a\nbullet inside him from martial plains over sea.\n\nHe knew he was a brute the moment he had done it; Selina had not meant\nto worry, only to comfort and assist. But his soul was one raw sore\nwithin him, when he found himself shut up in the schoolroom after hours,\nmerely for insisting that 7 times 7 amounted to 47. The injustice of it\nseemed so flagrant. Why not 47 as much as 49? One number was no prettier\nthan the other to look at, and it was evidently only a matter of\narbitrary taste and preference, and, anyhow, it had always been 47 to\nhim, and would be to the end of time. So when Selina came in out of the\nsun, leaving the Trappers or the Far West behind her, and putting off\nthe glory of being an Apache squaw in order to hear him his tables and\nwin his release, Harold turned on her venomously, rejected her kindly\novertures, and ever drove his elbow into her sympathetic ribs, in his\ndetermination to be left alone in the glory of sulks. The fit passed\ndirectly, his eyes were opened, and his soul sat in the dust as he\nsorrowfully began to cast about for some atonement heroic enough to\nsalve the wrong.\n\nOf course poor Selina looked for no sacrifice nor heroics whatever: she\ndidn’t even want him to say he was sorry. If he would only make it up,\nshe would have done the apologising part herself. But that was not a\nboy’s way. Something solid, Harold felt, was due from him; and until\nthat was achieved, making-up must not be thought of, in order that the\nfinal effect might not be spoilt. Accordingly, when his release came,\nand poor Selina hung about, trying to catch his eye, Harold, possessed\nby the demon of a distorted motive, avoided her steadily--though he\nwas bleeding inwardly at every minute of delay--and came to me instead.\nNeedless to say, I approved his plan highly; it was so much more\nhigh-toned than just going and making-up tamely, which any one could do;\nand a girl who had been jobbed in the ribs by a hostile elbow could\nnot be expected for a moment to overlook it, without the liniment of an\noffering to soothe her injured feelings.\n\n“I know what she wants most,” said Harold. “She wants that set of\ntea-things in the toy-shop window, with the red and blue flowers on ‘em;\nshe’s wanted it for months, ‘cos her dolls are getting big enough to\nhave real afternoon tea; and she wants it so badly that she won’t walk\nthat side of the street when we go into the town. But it costs five\nshillings!”\n\nThen we set to work seriously, and devoted the afternoon to a\nrealisation of assets and the composition of a Budget that might have\nbeen dated without shame from Whitehall. The result worked out as\nfollows:--\n\n                                                       s. d.\n     By one uncle, unspent through having been\n         lost for nearly a week--turned up at last\n         in the straw of the dog-kennel .  .  .  .     2  6\n\n                                                 ----\n                             Carry forward,            2  6\n\n\n                                                       s. d.\n                             Brought forward,          2  6\n     By advance from me on security of next\n         uncle, and failing that, to be called in at\n         Christmas .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  1  0\n     By shaken out of missionary-box with the\n         help of a knife-blade.  (They were our\n         own pennies and a forced levy) .  .  .  .  .  0  4\n     By bet due from Edward, for walking across\n         the field where Farmer Larkin’s bull was,\n         and Edward bet him twopence he wouldn’t\n         --called in with difficulty .  .  .  .  .  .  0  2\n     By advance from Martha, on no security at\n         all, only you mustn’t tell your aunt .  .  .  1  0\n\n                                                       ----\n\n                                               Total   5  0\n\nand at last we breathed again.\n\nThe rest promised to be easy. Selina had a tea-party at five on the\nmorrow, with the chipped old wooden tea-things that had served her\nsuccessive dolls from babyhood. Harold would slip off directly after\ndinner, going alone, so as not to arouse suspicion, as we were not\nallowed to go into the town by ourselves. It was nearly two miles to our\nsmall metropolis, but there would be plenty of time for him to go and\nreturn, even laden with the olive-branch neatly packed in shavings;\nbesides, he might meet the butcher, who was his friend and would give\nhim a lift. Then, finally, at five, the rapture of the new tea-service,\ndescended from the skies; and, retribution made, making-up at last,\nwithout loss of dignity. With the event before us, we thought it a small\nthing that twenty-four hours more of alienation and pretended sulks must\nbe kept up on Harold’s part; but Selina, who naturally knew nothing of\nthe treat in store for her, moped for the rest of the evening, and took\na very heavy heart to bed.\n\nWhen next day the hour for action arrived, Harold evaded Olympian\nattention with an easy modesty born of long practice, and made off for\nthe front gate. Selina, who had been keeping her eye upon him, thought\nhe was going down to the pond to catch frogs, a joy they had planned\nto share together, and made after him; but Harold, though he heard her\nfootsteps, continued sternly on his high mission, without even looking\nback; and Selina was left to wander disconsolately among flower-beds\nthat had lost--for her--all scent and colour. I saw it all, and although\ncold reason approved our line of action, instinct told me we were\nbrutes.\n\nHarold reached the town--so he recounted afterwards--in record time,\nhaving run most of the way for fear the tea-things, which had\nreposed six months in the window, should be snapped up by some other\nconscience-stricken lacerator of a sister’s feelings; and it seemed\nhardly credible to find them still there, and their owner willing to\npart with them for the price marked on the ticket. He paid his money\ndown at once, that there should be no drawing back from the bargain; and\nthen, as the things had to be taken out of the window and packed, and\nthe afternoon was yet young, he thought he might treat himself to a\ntaste of urban joys and la vie de Boheme. Shops came first, of course,\nand he flattened his nose successively against the window with the\nindia-rubber balls in it, and the clock-work locomotive; and against\nthe barber’s window, with wigs on blocks, reminding him of uncles,\nand shaving-cream that looked so good to eat; and the grocer’s window,\ndisplaying more currants than the whole British population could\npossibly consume without a special effort; and the window of the\nbank, wherein gold was thought so little of that it was dealt about in\nshovels. Next there was the market-place, with all its clamorous joys;\nand when a runaway calf came down the street like a cannon-ball, Harold\nfelt that he had not lived in vain. The whole place was so brimful of\nexcitement that he had quite forgotten the why and the wherefore of his\nbeing there, when a sight of the church clock recalled him to his better\nself, and sent him flying out of the town, as he realised he had only\njust time enough left to get back in. If he were after his appointed\nhour, he would not only miss his high triumph, but probably would be\ndetected as a transgressor of bounds,--a crime before which a private\nopinion on multiplication sank to nothingness. So he jogged along on his\nhomeward way, thinking of many things, and probably talking to himself\na good deal, as his habit was, and had covered nearly half the distance,\nwhen suddenly--a deadly sinking in the pit of his stomach--a paralysis\nof every limb--around him a world extinct of light and music--a black\nsun and a reeling sky--he had forgotten the tea-things!\n\nIt was useless, it was hopeless, all was over, and nothing could now be\ndone; nevertheless he turned and ran back wildly, blindly, choking\nwith the big sobs that evoked neither pity nor comfort from a merciless\nmocking world around; a stitch in his side, dust in his eyes, and black\ndespair clutching at his heart. So he stumbled on, with leaden legs and\nbursting sides, till--as if Fate had not yet dealt him her last worst\nbuffet--on turning a corner in the road he almost ran under the wheels\nof a dog-cart, in which, as it pulled up, was apparent the portly form\nof Farmer Larkin, the arch-enemy, whose ducks he had been shying stones\nat that very morning!\n\nHad Harold been in his right and unclouded senses, he would have\nvanished through the hedge some seconds earlier, rather than pain the\nfarmer by any unpleasant reminiscences which his appearance might call\nup; but as things were, he could only stand and blubber hopelessly,\ncaring, indeed, little now what further ill might befall him.\nThe farmer, for his part, surveyed the desolate figure with some\nastonishment, calling out in no unfriendly accents, “Why, Master Harold!\nwhatever be the matter? Baint runnin’ away, be ee?”\n\nThen Harold, with the unnatural courage born of desperation, flung\nhimself on the step, and climbing into the cart, fell in the straw at\nthe bottom of it, sobbing out that he wanted to go back, go back! The\nsituation had a vagueness; but the farmer, a man of action rather than\nwords, swung his horse round smartly, and they were in the town again\nby the time Harold had recovered himself sufficiently to furnish some\ndetails. As they drove up to the shop, the woman was waiting at the door\nwith the parcel; and hardly a minute seemed to have elapsed since the\nblack crisis, ere they were bowling along swiftly home, the precious\nparcel hugged in a close embrace.\n\nAnd now the farmer came out in quite a new and unexpected light. Never\na word did he say of broken fences and hurdles, of trampled crops and\nharried flocks and herds. One would have thought the man had never\npossessed a head of live stock in his life. Instead, he was deeply\ninterested in the whole dolorous quest of the tea-things, and\nsympathised with Harold on the disputed point in mathematics as if he\nhad been himself at the same stage of education. As they neared home,\nHarold found himself, to his surprise, sitting up and chatting to his\nnew friend like man to man; and before he was dropped at a convenient\ngap in the garden hedge, he had promised that when Selina gave her first\npublic tea-party, little Miss Larkin should be invited to come and\nbring ha whole sawdust family along with her; and the farmer appeared\nas pleased and proud as if he hat been asked to a garden-party at\nMarlborough House. Really, those Olympians have certain good points, far\ndown in them. I shall have to leave off abusing them some day.\n\nAt the hour of five, Selina, having spent the afternoon searching for\nHarold in all his accustomed haunts, sat down disconsolately to tea with\nher dolls, who ungenerously refused to wait beyond the appointed hour.\nThe wooden tea-things seemed more chipped than usual; and the dolls\nthemselves had more of wax and sawdust, and less of human colour and\nintelligence about them, than she ever remembered before. It was then\nthat Harold burst in, very dusty, his stockings at his heels, and the\nchannels ploughed by tears still showing on his grimy cheeks; and Selina\nwas at last permitted to know that he had been thinking of her ever\nsince his ill-judged exhibition of temper, and that his sulks had not\nbeen the genuine article, nor had he gone frogging by himself. It was\na very happy hostess who dispensed hospitality that evening to a\nglassy-eyed stiff-kneed circle; and many a dollish gaucherie, that would\nhave been severely checked on ordinary occasions, was as much overlooked\nas if it had been a birthday.\n\nBut Harold and I, in our stupid masculine way, thought all her happiness\nsprang from possession of the long-coveted tea-service.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17. “LUSISTI SATIS”\n\nAmong the many fatuous ideas that possessed the Olympian noddle, this\none was pre-eminent; that, being Olympians, they could talk quite freely\nin our presence on subjects of the closest import to us, so long as\nnames, dates, and other landmarks were ignored. We were supposed to\nbe denied the faculty for putting two and two together; and, like the\nmonkeys, who very sensibly refrain from speech lest they should be set\nto earn their livings, we were careful to conceal our capabilities for\na simple syllogism. Thus we were rarely taken by surprise, and so were\nconsidered by our disappointed elders to be apathetic and to lack the\ndivine capacity for wonder.\n\nNow the daily output of the letter-bag, with the mysterious discussions\nthat ensued thereon, had speedily informed us that Uncle Thomas was\nintrusted with a mission,--a mission, too, affecting ourselves. Uncle\nThomas’s missions were many and various; a self-important man, one\nliking the business while protesting that he sank under the burden, he\nwas the missionary, so to speak, of our remote habitation. The\nmatching a ribbon, the running down to the stores, the interviewing a\ncook,--these and similar duties lent constant colour and variety to\nhis vacant life in London and helped to keep down his figure. When the\nmatter, however, had in our presence to be referred to with nods and\npronouns, with significant hiatuses and interpolations in the French\ntongue, then the red flag was flown, the storm-cone hoisted, and by a\nstudious pretence of inattention we were not long in plucking out the\nheart of the mystery.\n\nTo clinch our conclusion, we descended suddenly and together on Martha;\nproceeding, however, not by simple inquiry as to facts,--that would\nnever have done,--but by informing her that the air was full of school\nand that we knew all about it, and then challenging denial. Martha was\na trusty soul, but a bad witness for the defence, and we soon had it all\nout of her. The word had gone forth, the school had been selected; the\nnecessary sheets were hemming even now; and Edward was the designated\nand appointed victim.\n\nIt had always been before us as an inevitable bourne, this\nstrange unknown thing called school; and yet--perhaps I should say\nconsequently--we had never seriously set ourselves to consider what it\nreally meant. But now that the grim spectre loomed imminent, stretching\nlean hands for one of our flock, it behoved us to face the situation,\nto take soundings in this uncharted sea and find out whither we were\ndrifting. Unfortunately, the data in our possession were absolutely\ninsufficient, and we knew not whither to turn for exact information.\nUncle Thomas could have told us all about it, of course; he had been\nthere himself, once, in the dim and misty past. But an unfortunate\nconviction, that Nature had intended him for a humourist, tainted all\nhis evidence, besides making it wearisome to hear. Again, of such among\nour contemporaries as we had approached, the trumpets gave forth\nan uncertain sound. According to some, it meant larks, revels,\nemancipation, and a foretaste of the bliss of manhood. According to\nothers,--the majority, alas!--it was a private and peculiar Hades, that\ncould give the original institution points and a beating. When Edward\nwas observed to be swaggering round with a jaunty air and his chest\nstuck out, I knew that he was contemplating his future from the one\npoint of view. When, on the contrary, he was subdued and unaggressive,\nand sought the society of his sisters, I recognised that the other\naspect was in the ascendant. “You can always run away, you know,” I\nused to remark consolingly on these latter occasions; and Edward would\nbrighten up wonderfully at the suggestion, while Charlotte melted into\ntears before her vision of a brother with blistered feet and an empty\nbelly, passing nights of frost ‘neath the lee of windy haystacks.\n\nIt was to Edward, of course, that the situation was chiefly productive\nof anxiety; and yet the ensuing change in my own circumstances and\nposition furnished me also with food for grave reflexion. Hitherto I\nhad acted mostly to orders. Even when I had devised and counselled any\nparticular devilry, it had been carried out on Edward’s approbation,\nand--as eldest--at his special risk. Henceforward I began to be anxious\nof the bugbear Responsibility, and to realise what a soul-throttling\nthing it is. True, my new position would have its compensations.\n\nEdward had been masterful exceedingly, imperious, perhaps a little\nnarrow; impassioned for hard facts, and with scant sympathy for\nmake-believe. I should now be free and untrammelled; in the conception\nand carrying out of a scheme, I could accept and reject to better\nartistic purpose.\n\nIt would, moreover, be needless to be a Radical any more. Radical I\nnever was, really, by nature or by sympathy. The part had been thrust\non me one day, when Edward proposed to foist the House of Lords on our\nsmall Republic. The principles of the thing he set forth learnedly and\nwell, and it all sounded promising enough, till he went on to explain\nthat, for the present at least, he proposed to be the House of Lords\nhimself. We others were to be the Commons. There would be promotions, of\ncourse, he added, dependent on service and on fitness, and open to both\nsexes; and to me in especial he held out hopes of speedy advancement.\nBut in its initial stages the thing wouldn’t work properly unless he\nwere first and only Lord. Then I put my foot down promptly, and said\nit was all rot, and I didn’t see the good of any House of Lords at all.\n“Then you must be a low Radical!” said Edward, with fine contempt. The\ninference seemed hardly necessary, but what could I do? I accepted the\nsituation, and said firmly, Yes, I was a low Radical. In this monstrous\ncharacter I had been obliged to masquerade ever since; but now I could\nthrow it off, and look the world in the face again.\n\nAnd yet, did this and other gains really out-balance my losses?\nHenceforth I should, it was true, be leader and chief; but I should also\nbe the buffer between the Olympians and my little clan. To Edward\nthis had been nothing; he had withstood the impact of Olympus without\nflinching, like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved. But was I equal to the\ntask? And was there not rather a danger that for the sake of peace and\nquietness I might be tempted to compromise, compound, and make terms?\nsinking thus, by successive lapses, into the Blameless Prig? I don’t\nmean, of course, that I thought out my thoughts to the exact point here\nset down. In those fortunate days of old one was free from the hard\nnecessity of transmuting the vague idea into the mechanical inadequate\nmedium of words. But the feeling was there, that I might not possess the\nqualities of character for so delicate a position.\n\nThe unnatural halo round Edward got more pronounced, his own demeanour\nmore responsible and dignified, with the arrival of his new clothes.\nWhen his trunk and play-box were sent in, the approaching cleavage\nbetween our brother, who now belonged to the future, and ourselves,\nstill claimed by the past, was accentuated indeed. His name was painted\non each of them, in large letters, and after their arrival their owner\nused to disappear mysteriously, and be found eventually wandering round\nhis luggage, murmuring to himself, “Edward----,” in a rapt, remote sort\nof way. It was a weakness, of course, and pointed to a soft spot in\nhis character; but those who can remember the sensation of first seeing\ntheir names in print will not think hardly of him.\n\nAs the short days sped by and the grim event cast its shadow longer and\nlonger across our threshold, an unnatural politeness, a civility scarce\ncanny, began to pervade the air. In those latter hours Edward himself\nwas frequently heard to say “Please,” and also “Would you mind fetchin’\nthat ball?” while Harold and I would sometimes actually find ourselves\ntrying to anticipate his wishes. As for the girls, they simply\ngrovelled. The Olympians, too, in their uncouth way, by gift of carnal\ndelicacies and such-like indulgence, seemed anxious to demonstrate that\nthey had hitherto misjudged this one of us. Altogether the situation\ngrew strained and false, and I think a general relief was felt when the\nend came.\n\nWe all trooped down to the station, of course; it is only in later\nyears that the farce of “seeing people off” is seen in its true colours.\nEdward was the life and soul of the party; and if his gaiety struck one\nat times as being a trifle overdone, it was not a moment to be critical.\nAs we tramped along, I promised him I would ask Farmer Larkin not to\nkill any more pigs till he came back for the holidays, and he said he\nwould send me a proper catapult,--the real lethal article, not a kid’s\nplaything. Then suddenly, when we were about half-way down, one of the\ngirls fell a-snivelling.\n\nThe happy few who dare to laugh at the woes of sea-sickness will perhaps\nremember how, on occasion, the sudden collapse of a fellow-voyager\nbefore their very eyes has caused them hastily to revise their\nself-confidence and resolve to walk more humbly for the future. Even so\nit was with Edward, who turned his head aside, feigning an interest in\nthe landscape. It was but for a moment; then he recollected the hat he\nwas wearing,--a hard bowler, the first of that sort he had ever owned.\nHe took it off, examined it, and felt it over. Something about it seemed\nto give him strength, and he was a man once more.\n\nAt the station, Edward’s first care was to dispose his boxes on the\nplatform so that every one might see the labels and the lettering\nthereon. One did not go to school for the first time every day! Then he\nread both sides of his ticket carefully; shifted it to every one of his\npockets in turn; and finally fell to chinking of his money, to keep his\ncourage up. We were all dry of conversation by this time, and could only\nstand round and stare in silence at the victim decked for the altar.\nAnd, as I looked at Edward, in new clothes of a manly cut, with a hard\nhat upon his head, a railway ticket in one pocket and money of his own\nin the other,--money to spend as he liked and no questions asked!--I\nbegan to feel dimly how great was the gulf already yawning betwixt us.\nFortunately I was not old enough to realise, further, that here on this\nlittle platform the old order lay at its last gasp, and that Edward\nmight come back to us, but it would not be the Edward of yore, nor could\nthings ever be the same again.\n\nWhen the train steamed up at last, we all boarded it impetuously with\nthe view of selecting the one peerless carriage to which Edward might\nbe intrusted with the greatest comfort and honour; and as each one found\nthe ideal compartment at the same moment, and vociferously maintained\nits merits, he stood some chance for a time of being left behind. A\nporter settled the matter by heaving him through the nearest door; and\nas the train moved off, Edward’s head was thrust out of the window,\nwearing on it an unmistakable first-quality grin that he had been saving\nup somewhere for the supreme moment. Very small and white his face\nlooked, on the long side of the retreating train. But the grin was\nvisible, undeniable, stoutly maintained; till a curve swept him from\nour sight, and he was borne away in the dying rumble, out of our placid\nbackwater, out into the busy world of rubs and knocks and competition,\nout into the New Life.\n\nWhen a crab has lost a leg, his gait is still more awkward than his\nwont, till Time and healing Nature make him totus teres atque rotundus\nonce more. We straggled back from the station disjointedly; Harold, who\nwas very silent, sticking close to me, his last slender props while\nthe girls in front, their heads together, were already reckoning up\nthe weeks to the holidays. Home at last, Harold suggested one or two\noccupations of a spicy and contraband flavour, but though we did our\nmanful best there was no knocking any interest out of them. Then I\nsuggested others, with the same want of success. Finally we found\nourselves sitting silent on an upturned wheelbarrow, our chins on our\nfists, staring haggardly into the raw new conditions of our changed\nlife, the ruins of a past behind our backs.\n\nAnd all the while Selina and Charlotte were busy stuffing Edward’s\nrabbits with unwonted forage, bilious and green; polishing up the cage\nof his mice till the occupants raved and swore like householders in\nspring-time; and collecting materials for new bows and arrows, whips,\nboats, guns, and four-in-hand harness, against the return of Ulysses.\nLittle did they dream that the hero, once back from Troy and all its\nonsets, would scornfully condemn their clumsy but laborious armoury\nas rot and humbug and only fit for kids! This, with many another like\nawakening, was mercifully hidden from them. Could the veil have been\nlifted, and the girls permitted to see Edward as he would appear a short\nthree months hence, ragged of attire and lawless of tongue, a scorner of\ntradition and an adept in strange new physical tortures, one who\nwould in the same half-hour dismember a doll and shatter a hallowed\nbelief,--in fine, a sort of swaggering Captain, fresh from the Spanish\nMain,--could they have had the least hint of this, well, then perhaps--.\nBut which of us is of mental fibre to stand the test of a glimpse into\nfuturity? Let us only hope that, even with certain disillusionment\nahead, the girls would have acted precisely as they did.\n\nAnd perhaps we have reason to be very grateful that, both as children\nand long afterwards, we are never allowed to guess how the absorbing\npursuit of the moment will appear, not only to others, but to ourselves,\na very short time hence. So we pass, with a gusto and a heartiness that\nto an onlooker would seem almost pathetic, from one droll devotion to\nanother misshapen passion; and who shall care to play Rhadamanthus, to\nappraise the record, and to decide how much of it is solid achievement,\nand how much the merest child’s play?\n",
