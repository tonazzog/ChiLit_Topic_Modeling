Meade\n\nCHAPTER 1. \"GOOD-BYE\" TO THE OLD LIFE.\n\n\"Me want to see Hetty,\" said an imperious baby voice.\n\n\"No, no; not this morning, Miss Nan, dear.\"\n\n\"Me do want to see Hetty,\" was the quick, impatient reply.  And a sturdy\nindignant little face looked up at Nurse, to watch the effect of the\nlast decisive words.\n\nFinding no affirmative reply on Nurse's placid face, the small lips\nclosed firmly--two dimples came and went on two very round cheeks--the\nmischievous brown eyes grew full of laughter, and the next moment the\nlittle questioner had squeezed her way through a slightly open door, and\nwas toddling down the broad stone stairs and across a landing to Hetty's\nroom.  The room door was open, so the truant went in.  A bed with the\nbedclothes all tossed about, a half worn-out slipper on the floor, a\nvery untidy dressing-table met her eyes, but no Hetty.\n\n\"Me want Hetty, me do,\" piped the treble voice, and then the little feet\ncommenced a careful and watchful pilgrimage, the lips still firmly shut,\nthe dimples coming and going, and the eyes throwing many upward glances\nin the direction of Nurse and the nursery.\n\nNo pursuit as yet, and great, great hope of finding Hetty somewhere in\nthe down-stair regions.  Ah, now, how good! those dangerous stairs had\nbeen descended, and the little voice calling in shrill tones for Hetty\nrang out in the wide hall.\n\n\"Let her come to me,\" suddenly said an answering voice, and a girl of\nabout twelve, dressed in deep mourning, suddenly opened the door of a\nsmall study and clasped the little one in her arms.\n\n\"So you have found me, my precious, my dearest!  Brave, plucky little\nNan, you have got away from Nurse and found me out!  Come into the\nstudy, now, darling, and you shall have some breakfast.\"\n\n\"Me want a bicky, Hetty,\" said the baby voice; the round arms clasped\nHester's neck, but the brown eyes were already travelling eagerly over\nthe breakfast table in quest of spoil for those rosy little lips.\n\n\"Here are two biscuits, Nan.  Nan, look me in the face--here, sit steady\non my knee; you lose me, don't you Nan?\"\n\n\"Course me do,\" said the child.\n\n\"And I'm going away from you, Nan, darling.  For months and months I\nwon't see anything of you.  My heart will be always with you, and I\nshall think of you morning, noon, and night.  I love no one as I love\nyou, Nan.  You will think of me, and love me too; won't you, Nan?\"\n\n\"Me will,\" said Nan; \"me want more bicky, Hetty.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Hester; \"put your arms tight round my neck, and you\nshall have sugar, too.  Tighter than that, Nan, and you shall have two\nlumps of sugar--oh, yes, you shall--I don't care if it makes you sick--\nyou shall have just what you want the last moment we are together.\"\n\nBaby Nan was only too pleased to crumple up a crape frill and to smear a\nblack dress with sticky little fingers for the sake of the sugar which\nHetty plied her with.\n\n\"More, Hetty,\" she said; \"me'll skeeze 'oo vedy tight for more.\"\n\nOn this scene Nurse unexpectedly entered.\n\n\"Well, I never! and so you found your way all downstairs by yourself,\nyou little toddle.  Now, Miss Hetty, I hope you haven't been giving the\nprecious lamb sugar; you know it never does suit the little dear.  Oh,\nfie! baby; and what sticky hands!  Miss Hetty, she has crumpled all your\ncrape frills.\"\n\n\"What matter?\" said Hester.  \"I wanted a good hug, and I gave her three\nor four lumps.  Babies won't squeeze you tight for nothing.  There, my\nNancy, go back to Nurse.  Nurse, take her away; I'll break down in a\nminute if I see her looking at me with that little pout.\"\n\nNurse took the child into her arms.\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Hester, dear.  Try to be a good girl at school.  Take my\nword, missy--things won't be as dark as they seem.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Nurse,\" said Hester hastily.  \"Is that you, father? are you\ncalling me?\"\n\nShe gathered up her muff and gloves, and ran out of the little study\nwhere she had been making believe to eat breakfast.  A tall,\nstern-looking man was in the hall, buttoning on an overcoat; a brougham\nwaited at the door.  The next moment Hester and her father were bowling\naway in the direction of the nearest railway station.  Nan's little\nchubby face had faded from view.  The old square grey house, sacred to\nHester because of Nan, had also disappeared; the avenue even was past,\nand Hester closed her bright brown eyes.  She felt that she was being\npushed out into a cold world, and was no longer in the same snug nest\nwith Nan.  An intolerable pain was at her heart; she did not glance at\nher father, who during their entire drive occupied himself over his\nmorning paper.  At last they reached the railway station, and just as\nSir John Thornton was handing his daughter into a comfortable\nfirst-class carriage, marked \"For Ladies only,\" and was presenting her\nwith her railway ticket and a copy of the last week's illustrated\nnewspaper, he spoke--\n\n\"The guard will take care of you, Hester.  I am giving him full\ndirections, and he will come to you at every station, and bring you tea\nor any refreshment you may require.  This train takes you straight to\nSefton, and Mrs Willis will meet you, or send for you there.  Good-bye,\nmy love; try to be a good girl, and curb your wild spirits.  I hope to\nsee you very much improved when you come home at Midsummer.  Good-bye,\ndear, good-bye.  Ah, you want to kiss me--well, just one kiss.  There--\noh, my dear! you know I have a great dislike to emotion in public.\"\n\nSir John Thornton said this because a pair of arms had been flung\nsuddenly round his neck, and two kisses imprinted passionately on his\nsallow cheek.  A tear also rested on his cheek, but that he wiped away.\n\nCHAPTER 2. TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.\n\nThe train moved rapidly on its way, and the girl in one corner of the\nrailway carriage cried silently behind her crape veil.  Her tears were\nvery subdued, but her heart felt sore, bruised, indignant; she hated the\nidea of school-life before her, she hated the expected restraints and\nthe probable punishments; she fancied herself going from a free life\ninto a prison, and detested it accordingly.\n\nThree months before, Hester Thornton had been one of the happiest,\nbrightest, and merriest of little girls in ---shire; but the mother who\nwas her guardian angel, who had kept the frank and spirited child in\ncheck without appearing to do so, who had guided her by the magical\npower of love and not in the least by that of fear, had met her death\nsuddenly by means of a carriage accident, and Hester and baby Nan were\nleft motherless.  Several little brothers and sisters had come between\nHester and Nan, but from various causes they had all died in their\ninfancy, and only the eldest and youngest of Sir John Thornton's family\nremained.\n\nHester's father was stern, uncompromising.  He was a very just and\nupright man, but he knew nothing of the ways of children, and when\nHester in her usual tom-boyish fashion climbed trees and tore her\ndresses, and rode bare-backed on one or two of his most dangerous\nhorses, he not only tried a little sharp, and therefore useless,\ncorrection, but determined to take immediate steps to have his wild and\nrather unmanageable little daughter sent to a first-class school.\nHester was on her way there now, and very sore was her heart, and\nindignant her impulses.  Father's \"good-bye\" seemed to her to be the\ncrowning touch to her unhappiness, and she made up her mind not to be\ngood, not to learn her lessons, not to come home at Midsummer crowned\nwith honours and reduced to an every-day and pattern little girl.  No,\nshe would be the same wild Hetty as of yore: and when father saw that\nschool could do nothing for her, that it could never make her into a\ngood and ordinary little girl, he would allow her to remain at home.  At\nhome there was, at least, Nan to love, and there was mother to remember.\n\nHetty was a child of the strongest feelings.  Since her mother's death\nshe had scarcely mentioned her name.  When her father alluded to his\nwife, Hester ran out of the room: when the servants spoke of their late\nmistress, Hester turned pale, stamped her feet, and told them to be\nquiet.\n\n\"You are not worthy to speak of my mother,\" she electrified them all one\nday by exclaiming.  \"My mother is an angel now, and you--oh, you are not\nfit to breathe her name!\"\n\nOnly to one person would Hetty ever voluntarily say a word about the\nbeloved dead mother, and that was to little Nan.  Nan said her prayers,\nas she expressed it, to Hetty now; and Hetty taught her a little phrase\nto use instead of the familiar \"God bless mother.\"  She taught the child\nto say, \"Thank God for making mother into a beautiful angel;\" and when\nNan asked what an angel was, and how the cosy mother she remembered\ncould be turned into one, Hester was beguiled into a soft and tearful\ntalk, and she drew several lovely pictures of white-robed angels, until\nthe little child was satisfied and said--\n\n\"Me like that, Hetty--me'll be angel too, Hetty, same as mamma.\"\n\nThese talks with Nan, however, did not come very often, and of late they\nhad almost ceased, for Nan was only two and a half, and the strange sad\nfact remained that in three months she had almost forgotten her mother.\n\nHester on her way to school this morning cried for some time, then she\nsat silent, her crape veil still down, and her eyes watching furtively\nher fellow-passengers.  They consisted of two rather fidgety old ladies,\nwho wrapped themselves in rugs, were very particular on the question of\nhot bottles, and watched Hester in their turn with considerable\ncuriosity and interest.  Presently one of them offered the little girl a\nsandwich, which she was too proud or too shy to accept, although by this\ntime she was feeling extremely hungry.\n\n\"You will, perhaps, prefer a cake, my dear?\" said the good-natured\nlittle old lady.  \"My sister Agnes has got some delicious queen-cakes in\nher basket--will you eat one?\"\n\nHester murmured a feeble assent, and the queen-cake did her so much good\nthat she ventured to raise her crape veil and to look around her.\n\n\"Ah, that is much better,\" said the first little old lady.  \"Come to\nthis side of the carriage, my love; we are just going to pass through a\nlovely bit of country, and you will like to watch the view.  See; if you\nplace yourself here, my sister Agnes's basket will be just at your feet,\nand you can help yourself to a queen-cake whenever you are so disposed.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" responded Hester, in a much more cheerful tone, for it was\nreally quite impossible to keep up reserve with such a bright-looking\nlittle old lady; \"your queen-cakes are very nice, and I liked that one,\nbut one is quite enough, thank you.  It is Nan who is so particularly\nfond of queen-cakes.\"\n\n\"And who is Nan, my dear?\" asked the sister to whom the queen-cakes\nspecially belonged.\n\n\"She is my dear little baby sister,\" said Hester in a sorrowful tone.\n\n\"Ah, and it was about her you were crying just now,\" said the first\nlady, laying her hand on Hester's arm.  \"Never mind us, dear, we have\nseen a great many tears--a great many.  They are the way of the world.\nWomen are born to them.  As Kingsley says--`women must weep.'  It was\nquite natural that you should cry about your sweet little Nan, and I\nwish we could send her some of these queen-cakes that you say she is so\nfond of.  Are you going to be long away from her, love?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, for months and months,\" said Hester.  \"I did not know,\" she\nadded, \"that it was such a common thing to cry.  I never used to.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have had other trouble, poor child,\" glancing at her deep\nmourning frock.\n\n\"Yes, it is since then I have cried so often.  Please, I would rather\nnot speak about it.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my love, quite right,\" said Miss Agnes in a much brisker\ntone than her sister.  \"We will turn the conversation now to something\ninspiriting.  Jane is quite right, there are plenty of tears in the\nworld; but there is also a great deal of sunshine and heaps of laughter,\nmerry laughter--the laughter of youth, my child.  Now, I dare say,\nthough you have begun your journey so sadly, that you are really bound\non quite a pleasant little expedition.  For instance, you are going to\nvisit a kind aunt, or some one else who will give you a delightful\nwelcome.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hester, \"I am not.  I am going to a dreadful place, and the\nthought of that, and parting from little Nan, are the reasons why I\ncried.  I am going to prison--I am, indeed.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear love!\" exclaimed both the little old ladies in a breath.\nThen Miss Agnes continued: \"You have really taken Jane's breath away--\nquite.  Yes, Jane, I see that you are in for an attack of palpitation.\nNever mind her, dear, she palpitates very easily; but I think you must\nbe mistaken, my love, in mentioning such an appalling word as `prison.'\nYes, now I come to think of it, it is absolutely certain that you must\nbe mistaken; for if you were going to such a terrible place of\npunishment you would be under the charge of a policeman.  You are given\nto strong language, dear, like other young folk.\"\n\n\"Well, I call it prison,\" continued Hester, who was rather flattered by\nall this bustle and Miss Jane's agitation; \"it has a dreadful sound,\nhasn't it?  I call it prison, but father says I am going to school--you\ncan't wonder that I am crying, can you?  Oh! what is the matter?\"\n\nFor the two little old ladies jumped up at this juncture, and gave Hetty\na kiss apiece on her soft young lips.\n\n\"My darling,\" they both exclaimed.  \"We are so relieved and delighted!\nyour strong language startled us, and school is anything but what you\nimagine, dear.  Ah, Jane! can you ever forget our happy days at school?\"\n\nMiss Jane sighed and rolled up her eyes, and then the two commenced a\nvigorous catechising of the little girl.  Really, Hester could not help\nfeeling almost sunshiny before that long journey came to an end, for she\nand the Misses Bruce made some delightful discoveries.  The little old\nladies very quickly found out that they lived close to the school where\nHetty was to spend the next few months.  They knew Mrs Willis well--\nthey knew the delightful rambling, old-fashioned house where Hester was\nto live--they even knew two or three of the scholars: and they said so\noften to the little girl that she was going into a life of clover--\npositive clover--that she began to smile, and even partly to believe\nthem.\n\n\"I am glad I shall be near you, at least,\" she said at last, with a\nfrank sweet smile, for she had greatly taken to her kind\nfellow-travellers.\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" exclaimed Miss Jane.  \"We attend the same church, and I\nshall look out for you on Sunday, and,\" she continued, glancing first at\nher sister and then addressing Hester, \"perhaps Mrs Willis will allow\nyou to visit us occasionally.\"\n\n\"I'll come to-morrow, if you like,\" said Hester.\n\n\"Well, dear, well--that must be as Mrs Willis thinks best.  Ah, here we\nare at Sefton at last.  We shall look out for you in church on Sunday,\nmy love.\"\n\nCHAPTER 3. AT LAVENDER HOUSE.\n\nHester's journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable.  She had taken\na great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made\nthemselves pleasant in her behalf.  She felt herself something like a\nheroine as she poured out a little, just a little, of her troubles into\ntheir sympathising ears; and their cheerful remarks with regard to\nschool and school-life had caused her to see clearly that there might be\nanother and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with\nregard to her future.\n\nBut during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender\nHouse, Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled.  The Misses\nBruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to\ntheir small villa in the town, but Lavender House was some distance off,\nand the little omnibus never went so far.\n\nAn old-fashioned carriage, which the ladies told Hester belonged to Mrs\nWillis, had been sent to meet her, and a man whom the Misses Bruce\naddressed as \"Thomas\" helped to place her trunk and a small portmanteau\non the roof of the vehicle.  The little girl had to take her drive\nalone, and the rather ancient horse which drew the old carriage climbed\nup and down the steep roads in a most leisurely fashion.  It was a cold\nwinter's day, and by the time Thomas had executed some commissions in\nSefton, and had reached the gates of the avenue which led to Lavender\nHouse, it was very nearly dark.  Hester trembled at the darkness, and\nwhen the gates were shut behind them by a rosy-faced urchin of ten, she\nonce more began to feel the cruel and desolate idea that she was going\nto prison.\n\nThey drove slowly down a long and winding avenue, and, although Hester\ncould not see, she knew they must be passing under trees, for several\ntimes their branches made a noise against the roof of the carriage.  At\nlast they came to a standstill.  The old servant scrambled slowly down\nfrom his seat on the box, and, opening the carriage-door, held out his\nhand to help the little stranger to alight.\n\n\"Come now, missy,\" he said in cheering tones, \"come out, and you'll be\nwarm and snug in a minute.  Dear, dear!  I expect you're nearly froze\nup, poor little miss, and it _is_ a most bitter cold night.\"\n\nHe rang a bell which hung by the entrance of a deep porch, and the next\nmoment the wide hall door was flung open by a neat maid-servant, and\nHester stepped within.\n\n\"She's come,\" exclaimed several voices in different keys, and proceeding\napparently from different quarters.  Hester looked around her in a\nhalf-startled way, but she could see no one, except the maid, who smiled\nat her and said--\n\n\"Welcome to Lavender House, miss.  If you'll step into the porter's room\nfor one moment, there is a good fire there, and I'll acquaint Miss\nDanesbury that you have arrived.\"\n\nThe little room in question was at the right-hand side of a very wide\nand cheerful hall, which was decorated in pale tints of green, and had a\nhandsome encaustic-tiled floor.  A blazing fire and two lamps made the\nhall look cheerful, but Hester was very glad to take refuge from the\nunknown voices in the porter's small room.  She found herself quite\ntrembling with shyness, and cold, and an indescribable longing to get\nback to Nan; and as she waited for Miss Danesbury and wondered fearfully\nwho or what Miss Danesbury was, she scarcely derived any comfort from\nthe blazing fire near which she stood.\n\n\"Rather tall for her age, but I fear, I greatly fear, a little sulky,\"\nsaid a voice behind her; and when she turned round in an agony of\ntrepidation and terror, she suddenly found herself face to face with a\ntall, kind-looking, middle-aged lad and also with a bright gipsy-looking\ngirl.\n\n\"Annie Forest, how very naughty of you to hide behind the door!  You are\nguilty of disobedience in coming into the room without leave.  I must\nreport you, my dear; yes, I really must.  You lose two good conduct\nmarks for this, and will probably have thirty lines in addition to your\nusual quantity of French poetry.\"\n\n\"But she won't tell on me, she won't, dear old Danesbury,\" said the\ngirl; \"she couldn't be so hard-hearted, the precious love, particularly\nas curiosity happens to be one of her own special little virtues!  Take\na kiss, Danesbury, and now, a you love me you'll be merciful!\"  The girl\nflitted away, and Miss Danesbury turned to Hester, whose face had\nchanged from red to pale during this little scene.\n\n\"What a horrid, vulgar, low-bred girl!\" she exclaimed with passion, for\nin all the experiences of her short life Hester had never even imagined\nthat personal remarks could be made of any one in their very presence.\n\"I hope she'll get a lot of punishment--I hope you are not going to\nforgive her,\" she continued, for her anger had for the time quite\novercome her shyness.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear! we should all be forgiving,\" exclaimed Miss\nDanesbury in her gentle voice.  \"Welcome to Lavender House, love; I am\nsorry I was not in the hall to receive you.  Had I been, this little\n_rencontre_ would not have occurred.  Annie Forest meant no harm,\nhowever--she's a wild little sprite, but affectionate.  You and she will\nbe the best friends possible by-and-by.  Now, let me take you to your\nroom; the gong for tea will sound in exactly five minutes, and I am sure\nyou will be glad of something to eat.\"\n\nMiss Danesbury then led Hester across the hall and up some broad, low,\nthickly-carpeted stairs.  When they had ascended two flights, and were\nstanding on a handsome landing, she paused.\n\n\"Do you see this baize door, dear?\" she said.  \"This is the entrance to\nthe school part of the house.  This part that we are now in belongs\nexclusively to Mrs Willis, and the girls are never allowed to come here\nwithout leave.  All the school-life is lived at the other side of this\nbaize door, and a very happy life I assure you it is for those little\ngirls who make up their minds to be brave and good.  Now kiss me, my\ndear, and let me bid you welcome once again to Lavender House.\"\n\n\"Are you our principal teacher, then?\" asked Hester.\n\n\"I? oh dear, no, my love.  I teach the younger children English, and I\nlook after the interests and comforts of all.  I am a very useful sort\nof person, I believe, and I have a motherly heart, dear, and it is a way\nwith little girls to come to me when they are in trouble.  Now, my love,\nwe must not chatter any longer.  Take my hand, and let us get to your\nroom as fast as possible.\"\n\nMiss Danesbury pushed open the baize door, and instantly Hester found\nherself in a different region.  Mrs Willis's part of the house gave the\nimpression of warmth, luxuriance, and even elegance of arrangement.  At\nthe other side of the door were long, narrow corridors, with snow-white,\nbut carpetless floors, and rather cold, distempered walls.  Miss\nDanesbury, holding the new pupil's hand, led her down two corridors, and\npast a great number of shut doors, behind which Hester could near\nsuppressed laughter and eager, chattering voices.  At last, however,\nthey stopped at a door which had the number \"32\" written over it.\n\n\"This is your bedroom, dear,\" said the English teacher, \"and to-night\nyou will not be sorry to have it alone.  Mrs Willis received a telegram\nfrom Susan Drummond, your room-mate, this afternoon, and she will not\narrive until to-morrow.\"\n\nHowever bare and even cold the corridors looked, the bedroom into which\nHester was ushered by no means corresponded with this appearance.  It\nwas a small, but daintily-furnished little room.  The floor was carpeted\nwith green felt, the one window was hung with pretty draperies, and two\nlittle, narrow, white beds were arranged gracefully with French\ncanopies.  All the furniture in the room was of a minute description,\nbut good of its kind.  Beside each bed stood a mahogany chest of\ndrawers.  At two corresponding corners were marble washhand-stands, and\neven two pretty, toilet tables stood side by side in the recess of the\nwindow.  But the sight that perhaps pleased Hester most was a small\nbright fire which burnt in the grate.\n\n\"Now, dear, this is your room.  As you have arrived first you can choose\nyour own bed and your own chest of drawers.  Ah, that is right, Ellen\nhas unfastened your portmanteau; she will unpack your trunk to-night,\nand take it to the box-room.  Now, dear, smooth your hair and wash your\nhands.  The gong will sound instantly.  I will come for you when it\ndoes.\"\n\nCHAPTER 4. LITTLE DRAWING-ROOMS AND LITTLE TIFFS.\n\nMiss Danesbury, true to her word, came to fetch Hester down to tea.\nThey went down some broad carpetless stairs, along a wide stone hall,\nand then paused for an instant at a half-open door from which a stream\nof eager voices issued.\n\n\"I will introduce you to your school-fellows, and I hope your future\nfriends,\" said Miss Danesbury.  \"After tea you will come with me to see\nMrs Willis--she is never in the school-room at tea-time.  Mdlle.\nPerier or Miss Good usually superintends.  Now, my dear, come along--\nwhy, surely you are not frightened?\"\n\n\"Oh, please, may I sit near you?\" asked Hester.\n\n\"No, my love; I take care of the little ones, and they are at a table by\nthemselves.  Now, come in at once--the moment you dread will soon be\nover, and it is nothing, my love--really nothing.\"\n\nNothing! never, as long as Hester lived, did she forget the supreme\nagony of terror and shyness which came over her as she entered that\nlong, low, brightly-lighted room.  The forty pairs of curious eyes which\nwere raised inquisitively to her face became as torturing as forty\nburning suns.  She felt an almost uncontrollable desire to run away and\nhide--she wondered if she could possibly keep from screaming aloud.  In\nthe end she found herself, she scarcely knew how, seated beside a\ngentle, sweet-mannered girl, and munching bread and butter which tasted\ndrier than sawdust, and occasionally trying to sip something very hot\nand scalding which she vaguely understood went by the name of tea.  The\nbuzzing voices all chattering eagerly in French, and the occasional\nsharp, high-pitched reprimands coming in peremptory tones from the thin\nlips of Mdlle.  Perier, sounded far off and distant--her head was dizzy,\nher eyes swam--the tired and shy child endured tortures.\n\nIn after-days, in long after-years when the memory of Lavender House was\nto come back to Hetty Thornton as one of the sweetest, brightest\nepisodes in her existence--in the days when she was to know almost every\nblade of grass in the gardens, and to be familiar with each corner of\nthe old house, with each face which now appeared so strange, she might\nwonder at her feelings to-night, but never even then could she forget\nthem.\n\nShe sat at the table in a dream, trying to eat the tasteless bread and\nbutter.  Suddenly and swiftly the thick and somewhat stale piece of\nbread on her plate was exchanged for a thin, fresh, and delicately-cut\nslice.\n\n\"Eat that,\" whispered a voice--\"I know the other is horrid.  It's a\nshame of Perier to give such stuff to a stranger.\"\n\n\"Mdlle.  Cecile, you are transgressing: you are talking English,\" came\nin a torrent of rapid French from the head of the table.  \"You lose a\nconduct mark, ma'amselle.\"\n\nThe young girl who sat next Hester inclined her head gently and\nsubmissively, and Hester, venturing to glance at her, saw that a\ndelicate pink had spread itself over her pale face.  She was a plain\ngirl; but even Hester, in this first moment of terror, could scarcely\nhave been afraid of her, so benign was her expression, so sweet the\nglance from her soft, full brown eyes.  Hester now further observed that\nthe thin bread and butter had been removed from Cecil's own plate.  She\nbegan to wonder why this girl was indulged with better food than the\nrest of her comrades.\n\nHester was beginning to feel a little less shy, and was taking one or\ntwo furtive glances at her companions, when she suddenly felt herself\nturning crimson, and all her agony of shyness and dislike to her\nschool-life returning.  She encountered the full, bright, quizzical gaze\nof the girl who had made personal remarks about her in the porter's\nroom.  The merry black eyes of this gipsy maiden fairly twinkled with\nsuppressed fun when they met hers, and the bright head even nodded\naudaciously across the table to her.\n\nNot for worlds would Hester return this friendly greeting--she still\nheld to her opinion that Miss Forest was one of the most ill-bred people\nshe had ever met, and, in addition to feeling a considerable amount of\nfear of her, she quite made up her mind that she would never be on\nfriendly terms with so underbred a girl.\n\nAt this moment grace was repeated in sonorous tones by a stern-looking\nperson who sat at the foot of the long table, and whom Hester had not\nbefore noticed.  Instantly the girls rose from their seats, and began to\nfile in orderly procession out of the tea-room.  Hester looked round in\nterror for the friendly Miss Danesbury, but she could not catch sight of\nher anywhere.  At this moment, however, her companion of the tea-table\ntouched her arm.\n\n\"We may speak English now for half an hour,\" she said, \"and most of us\nare going to the play-room.  We generally tell stories round the fire\nupon these dark winter's nights.  Would you like to come with me\nto-night?  Shall we be chums for this evening?\"\n\n\"I don't know what `chums' are,\" said Hester; \"but,\" she added, with the\ndawning of a faint smile on her poor, sad little face, \"I shall be very\nglad to go with you.\"\n\n\"Come then,\" said Cecil Temple, and she pulled Hester's hand within her\narm, and walked with her across the wide stone hall, and into the\nlargest room Hester had ever seen.\n\nNever, anywhere, could there have been a more delightful play-room than\nthis.  It was so large that two great fires which burned at either end\nwere not at all too much to emit even tolerable warmth.  The room was\nbright with three or four lamps which were suspended from the ceiling,\nthe floor was covered with matting, and the walls were divided into\ncurious partitions, which gave the room a peculiar but very cosy effect.\nThese partitions consisted of large panels, and were divided by slender\nrails the one from the other.\n\n\"This is my cosy corner,\" said Cecil, \"and you shall sit with me in it\nto-night.  You see,\" she added, \"each of us girls has her own partition,\nand we can do exactly what we like in it.  We can put our own\nphotographs, our own drawings, our own treasures on our panels.  Under\neach division is our own little work-table, and, in fact, our own\nindividual treasures lie round us in the enclosure of this dear little\nrail.  The centre of the room is common property, and you see what a\ngreat space there is round each fire-place where we can chatter and\ntalk, and be on common ground.  The fire-place at the end of the room\nnear the door is reserved especially for the little ones, but we elder\ngirls sit at the top.  Of course you will belong to us.  How old are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Twelve,\" said Hester.\n\n\"Oh, well, you are so tall that you cannot possibly be put with the\nlittle ones, so you must come in with us.\"\n\n\"And shall I have a railed-in division and a panel of my own?\" asked\nHester.  \"It sounds a very nice arrangement.  I hope my department will\nbe close to yours, Miss?\"\n\n\"Temple is my name,\" said Cecil, \"but you need not call me that.  I am\nCecil to all my friends, and you are my friend this evening, for you are\nmy chum, you know.  Oh, you were asking me about our departments--you\nwon't have any at first, for you have got to earn it, but I will invite\nyou to mine pretty often.  Come now, let us go inside.  Is not it just\nlike the darlingest little drawing-room?  I am so sorry that I have only\none easy chair, but you shall have it to-night, and I will sit on this\nthree-legged stool.  I am saving up my money to buy another armchair,\nand Annie has promised to upholster it for me.\"\n\n\"Is Annie one of the maids?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no!--she's dear old Annie Forest, the liveliest girl in the\nschool.  Poor darling, she's seldom out of hot water; but we all love\nher, we can't help it.  Poor Annie, she hardly ever has the luxury of a\ndepartment to herself, so she is useful all round.  She's the most\namusing and good-natured dear pet in Christendom.\"\n\n\"I don't like her at all,\" said Hester; \"I did not know you were talking\nof her--she is a most rude, uncouth girl.\"  Cecil Temple, who had been\narranging a small dark green table-cloth with daffodils worked\nartistically in each corner on her little table, stood up as the\nnewcomer uttered these words, and regarded her fixedly.\n\n\"It is a pity to draw hasty conclusions,\" she said.  \"There is no girl\nmore loved in the school than Annie Forest.  Even the teachers, although\nthey are always punishing her, cannot help having a soft corner in their\nhearts for her.  What can she possibly have done to offend you?--but\noh!--hush--don't speak--she is coming into the room.\"\n\nAs Cecil finished her rather eager defence of her friend, and prevented\nthe indignant words which were bubbling to Hester's lips, a gay voice\nwas heard singing a comic song in the passage--the play-room door was\nflung open with a bang, and Miss Forest entered the room with a small\ngirl seated on each of her shoulders.\n\n\"Hold on, Janny love; keep your arms well round me, Mabel.  Now then,\nhere we go--twice up the room and down again.  No more, as I'm alive.\nI've got to attend to other matters than you.\"\n\nShe placed the little girls on the floor amid peals of laughter, and\nshouts from several little ones to give them a ride too.  The children\nbegan to cling to her skirts and to drag her in all directions, and she\nfinally escaped from them with one dexterous bound which placed her in\nthat portion of the play-room where the little ones knew they were not\nallowed to enter.\n\nUntil her arrival the different girls scattered about the large room had\nbeen more or less orderly, chattering and laughing together, it is true,\nbut in a quiet manner.  Now the whole place appeared suddenly in an\nuproar.\n\n\"Annie, come here--Annie, darling, give me your opinion about this--\nAnnie, my precious, naughty creature, come and tell me about your last\nscrape.\"\n\nAnnie Forest blew several kisses to her adorers, but did not attach\nherself to any of them.\n\n\"The Temple requires me,\" she said, in her sauciest tones; \"my beloved\nfriends, the Temple as usual is vouchsafing its sacred shelter to the\nstranger.\"\n\nIn an instant Annie was kneeling inside the inclosure of Miss Temple's\nrail and laughing immoderately.\n\n\"You dear stranger!\" she exclaimed, turning round and gazing full into\nHester's shy face, \"I do declare I have been punished for the intense\nardour with which I longed to embrace you.  Has she told you, Cecil\ndarling, what I did in her behalf?  How I ventured beyond the sacred\nprecincts of the baize door and hid inside the porter's room?  Poor\ndear, she jumped when she heard my friendly voice, and as I spoke Miss\nDanesbury caught me in the very act.  Poor old dear, she cried when she\ncomplained of me, but duty is Danesbury's motto; she would go to the\nstake for it, and I respect her immensely.  I have got my twenty lines\nof that horrible French poetry, to learn--the very thought almost\nstrangles me, and I foresee plainly that I shall do something terribly\nnaughty within the next few hours; I must, my love--I really must.  I\nhave just come here to shake hands with Miss Thornton, and then I must\naway to my penance.  Ah, how little I shall learn, and how hard I shall\nthink!  Welcome to Lavender House, Miss Thornton; look upon me as your\ndevoted ally, and if you have a spark of pity in your breast, feel for\nthe girl whom you got into a scrape the very moment you entered these\nsacred walls.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Hester, who would not hold out her hand,\nand who was standing up in a very stiff, shy, and angular position.  \"I\nthink you were very rude to startle me, and make personal remarks the\nvery moment I came into the house.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!--I only said you were tall, and looked rather sulky, love--\nyou did, you know, really.\"\n\n\"It was very rude of you,\" repeated Hester, turning crimson, and trying\nto keep back her tears.\n\n\"Well, my dear, I meant no harm; shake hands, now, and let us make\nfriends.\"\n\nBut Hester felt either too shy or too miserable to yield to this\nrequest--she half turned her back, and leaned against Miss Temple's\npanel.\n\n\"Never mind her,\" whispered gentle Cecil Temple; but Annie Forest's\nbright face had darkened ominously--the school favourite was not\naccustomed to having her advances flung back in her face.  She left the\nroom singing a defiant, naughty song, and several of the girls who had\noverheard this scene whispered one to the other--\n\n\"She can't be at all nice--she would not even shake hands with Annie.\nFancy her turning against our Annie in that way!\"\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE HEAD-MISTRESS.\n\nAnnie Forest had scarcely left the room before Miss Danesbury appeared\nwith a message for Hester, who was to come with her directly to see Mrs\nWillis.  The poor shy girl felt only too glad to leave behind her the\ncruel, staring, and now by no means approving eyes of her school-mates.\nShe had overheard several of their whispers, and felt rather alarmed at\nher own act.  But Hester, shy as she was, could be very tenacious of an\nidea.  She had taken a dislike to Annie Forest, and she was quite\ndetermined to be true to what she considered her convictions--namely,\nthat Annie was underbred and common, and not at all the kind of girl\nwhom her mother would have cared for her to know.  The little girl\nfollowed Miss Danesbury in silence.  They crossed the stone hall\ntogether, and now passing through another baize door, found themselves\nonce more in the handsome entrance-hall.  They walked across this hall\nto a door carefully protected from all draughts by rich plush curtains,\nand Miss Danesbury, turning the handle, and going a step or two into the\nroom, said in her gentle voice--\n\n\"I have brought Hester Thornton to see you, Mrs Willis, according to\nyour wish.\"\n\nMiss Danesbury then withdrew, and Hester ventured to raise her eyes and\nto look timidly at the head-mistress.\n\nA tall woman, with a beautiful face and silvery white hair, came\ninstantly to meet her, laid her two hands on the girl's shoulders, and\nthen, raising her shy little face, imprinted a kiss on her forehead.\n\n\"Your mother was one of my earliest pupils, Hester,\" she said, \"and you\nare--no--\" after a pause, \"you are not very like her.  You are her\nchild, however, my dear, and as such you have a warm welcome from me.\nNow, come and sit by the fire, and let us talk.\"\n\nHester did not feel nearly so constrained with this graceful and\ngracious lady as she had done with her school-mates.  The atmosphere of\nthe room recalled her beloved mother's boudoir at home.  The rich,\ndove-coloured satin dress, the cap made of Mechlin lace which softened\nand shaded Mrs Willis's silvery hair, appeared homelike to the little\ngirl, who had grown up accustomed to all the luxuries of wealth.  Above\nall, the head-mistress's mention of her mother drew her heart toward the\nbeautiful face, and attracted her toward the rich, full tones of a voice\nwhich could be powerful and commanding at will.  Mrs Willis,\nnotwithstanding her white hair, had a youthful face, and Hester made the\ncomment which came first to her lips--\n\n\"I did not think you were old enough to have taught my mother.\"\n\n\"I am sixty, dear, and I have kept this school for thirty years.  Your\nmother was not the only pupil who sent her children to be taught by me\nwhen the time came.  Now, you can sit on this stool by the fire and tell\nme about your home.  Your mother--ah, poor child, you would rather not\ntalk about her just yet.  Helen's daughter must have strong feelings--\nah, yes; I see, I see.  Another time, darling, when you know me better.\nNow tell me about your little sister, and your father.  You do not know,\nperhaps, that I am Nan's godmother?\"\n\nAfter this the head-mistress and the new pupil had a long conversation.\nHester forgot her shyness; her whole heart had gone out instantly to\nthis beautiful woman who had known, and loved, and taught her mother.\n\n\"I will try to be good at school,\" she said at last; \"but, oh, please,\nMrs Willis, it does not seem to me to-night as if school-life could be\nhappy.\"\n\n\"It has its trials, Hester; but the brave and the noble girls often find\nthis time of discipline one of the best in their lives--good at the\ntime, very good to look back on by-and-by.  You will find a miniature\nworld around you; you will be surrounded by temptations; and you will\nhave rare chances of proving whether your character can be strong and\ngreat and true.  I think, as a rule, my girls are happy, and as a rule\nthey turn out well.  The great motto of life here, Hester, is\nearnestness.  We are earnest in our work, we are earnest in our play.  A\nhalf-hearted girl has no chance at Lavender House.  In play-time, laugh\nwith the merriest, my child: in school-hours, study with the most\nstudious.  Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"I try to, a little,\" said Hester, \"but it seems all very strange just\nnow.\"\n\n\"No doubt it does, and at first you will have to encounter many\nperplexities and to fight many battles.  Never mind, if you have the\nright spirit within you, you will come out on the winning side.  Now,\ntell me, have you made any acquaintances as yet among the girls?\"\n\n\"Yes--Cecil Temple has been kind to me.\"\n\n\"Cecil is one of my dearest pupils; cultivate her friendship, Hester--\nshe is honourable, she is sympathising.  I am not afraid to say that\nCecil has a great heart.\"\n\n\"There is another girl,\" continued Hester, \"who has spoken to me.  I\nneed not make her my friend, need I?\"\n\n\"Who is she, dear?\"\n\n\"Miss Forest--I don't like her.\"\n\n\"What! our school favourite.  You will change your mind, I expect--but\nthat is the gong for prayers.  You shall come with me to chapel,\nto-night, and I will introduce you to Mr Everard.\"\n\nCHAPTER 6. \"I AM UNHAPPY.\"\n\nBetween forty and fifty young girls assembled night and morning for\nprayers in the pretty chapel which adjoined Lavender House.  This chapel\nhad been reconstructed from the ruins of an ancient priory, on the site\nof which the house was built.  The walls, and even the beautiful eastern\nwindow, belonged to a far-off date.  The roof had been carefully reared\nin accordance with the style of the east window, and the whole effect\nwas beautiful and impressive.  Mrs Willis was particularly fond of her\nown chapel.  Here she hoped the girls' best lessons might be learned,\nand here she had even once or twice brought a refractory pupil, and\ntried what a gentle word or two spoken in these old and sacred walls\nmight effect.  Here, on wet Sundays the girls assembled for service; and\nhere, every evening at nine o'clock, came the vicar of the large parish\nto which Lavender House belonged, to conduct evening prayers.  He was an\nold man, and a great friend of Mrs Willis's, and he often told her that\nhe considered these young girls some of the most important members of\nhis flock.\n\nHere Hester knelt to-night.  It is to be doubted whether in her\nconfusion, and in the strange loneliness which even Mrs Willis had\nscarcely removed, she prayed much.  It is certain she did not join in\nthe evening hymn, which, with the aid of an organ and some sweet\ngirl-voices, was beautifully and almost pathetically rendered.  After\nevening prayers had come to an end, Mrs Willis took Hester's hand and\nled her up to the old, white-headed vicar.\n\n\"This is my new pupil, Mr Everard, or rather I should say, our new\npupil.  Her education depends as much on you as on me.\"\n\nThe vicar held out his hands, and took Hester's within them, and then\ndrew her forward to the light.\n\n\"This little face does not seem quite strange to me,\" he said.  \"Have I\never seen you before, my dear?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Hester.\n\n\"You have seen her mother,\" said Mrs Willis--\"Do you remember your\nfavourite pupil, Helen Anstey, of long ago?\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed--indeed!  I shall never forget Helen.  And are you her\nchild, little one?\"\n\nBut Hester's face had grown white.  The solemn service in the chapel,\njoined to all the excitement and anxieties of the day, had strung up her\nsensitive nerves to a pitch higher than she could endure.  Suddenly, as\nthe vicar spoke to her, and Mrs Willis looked kindly down at her new\npupil, the chapel seemed to reel round, the pupils one by one\ndisappeared, and the tired girl only saved herself from fainting by a\nsudden burst of tears.\n\n\"Oh, I am unhappy,\" she sobbed, \"without my mother!  Please, please,\ndon't talk to me about my mother.\"\n\nShe could scarcely take in the gentle words which her two friends said\nto her, and she hardly noticed when Mrs Willis did such a wonderful\nthing as to stoop down and kiss a second time the lips of a new pupil.\n\nFinally she found herself consigned to Miss Danesbury's care, who\nhurried her off to her room, and helped her to undress and tucked her\ninto her little bed.\n\n\"Now, love, you shall have some hot gruel.  No, not a word.  You ate\nlittle or no tea, to-night--I watched you from my distant table.  Half\nyour loneliness is caused by want of food--I know it, my love; I am a\nvery practical person.  Now, eat your gruel, and then shut your eyes and\ngo to sleep.\"\n\n\"You are very kind to me,\" said Hester, \"and so is Mrs Willis, and so\nis Mr Everard, and I like Cecil Temple--but, oh.  I wish Annie Forest\nwas not in the school!\"\n\n\"Hush, my dear, I implore of you.  You pain me by these words.  I am\nquite confident that Annie will be your best friend yet.\"\n\nHester's lips said nothing, but her eyes answered \"Never\" as plainly as\neyes could speak.\n\nCHAPTER 7. A DAY AT SCHOOL.\n\nIf Hester Thornton went to sleep that night under a sort of dreamy, hazy\nimpression that school was a place without a great deal of order, with\nmany kind and sympathising faces, and with some not so agreeable; if she\nwent to sleep under the impression that she had dropped into a sort of\nmedley, that she had found herself in a vast new world where certain\npersonages exercised undoubtedly a strong moral influence, but where on\nthe whole a number of other people did pretty much what they pleased--\nshe awoke in the morning to find her preconceived ideas scattered to the\nfour winds.\n\nThere was nothing of apparent liberty about the Lavender House\narrangements in the early morning hours.  In the first, place, it seemed\nquite the middle of the night when Hester was awakened by a loud gong,\nwhich clanged through the house and caused her to sit up in bed in a\nconsiderable state of fright and perplexity.  A moment or two later a\nneatly-dressed maid-servant came into the room with a can of hot water;\nshe lit a pair of candles on the mantelpiece, and, with the remark that\nthe second gong would sound in half an hour, and that all the young\nladies would be expected to assemble in the chapel at seven o'clock\nprecisely, she left the room.\n\nHester pulled her pretty little gold watch from under her pillow, and\nsaw with a sigh that it was now half-past six.\n\n\"What odious hours they keep in this horrid place!\" she said to herself.\n\"Well, well, I always did know that school would be unendurable.\"\n\nShe waited for five minutes before she got up, and then she dressed\nherself languidly, and, if the truth must be told, in a very untidy\nfashion.  She managed to be dressed by the time the second gong sounded,\nbut she had only one moment to give to her private prayers.  She\nreflected, however, that this did not greatly matter as she was going\ndown to prayers immediately in the chapel.\n\nThe service in the chapel the night before had impressed her more deeply\nthan she cared to own, and she followed her companions downstairs with a\ncertain feeling of pleasure at the thought of again seeing Mr Everard\nand Mrs Willis.  She wondered if they would take much notice of her\nthis morning, and she thought it just possible that Mr Everard, who had\nlooked at her so compassionately the night before, might be induced, for\nthe sake of his old friendship with her mother, to take her home with\nhim to spend the day.  She thought she would rather like to spend a day\nwith Mr Everard, and she fancied he was the sort of person who would\ninfluence her and help her to be good.  Hester fancied that if some very\ninteresting and quite out of the common person took her in hand, she\nmight be formed into something extremely noble--noble enough even to\nforgive Annie Forest.\n\nThe girls all filed into the chapel, which was lighted as brightly and\ncheerily as the night before; but Hester found herself placed on a bench\nfar down in the building.  She was no longer in the place of honour by\nMrs Willis's side.  She was one of a number, and no one looked\nparticularly at her or noticed her in any way.  A shy young curate read\nthe morning prayers; Mr Everard was not present, and Mrs Willis, who\nwas, walked out of the chapel when prayers were over without even\nglancing in Hester's direction.  This was bad enough for the poor little\ndreamer of dreams, but worse was to follow.\n\nMrs Willis did not speak to Hester, but she did stop for an instant\nbeside Annie Forest.  Hester saw her lay her white hand on the young\ngirl's shoulder and whisper for an instant in her ear.  Annie's lovely\ngipsy face flushed a vivid crimson.\n\n\"For your sake, darling,\" she whispered back; but Hester caught the\nwords, and was consumed by a fierce jealousy.\n\nThe girls went into the school-room, where Mdlle.  Perier gave a French\nlesson to the upper class.  Hester belonged to no class at present, and\ncould look around her, and have plenty of time to reflect on her own\nmiseries, and particularly on what she now considered the favouritism\nshown by Mrs Willis.\n\n\"Mr Everard at least will read through that girl,\" she said to herself;\n\"he could not possibly endure any one so loud.  Yes, I am sure that my\nonly friend at home, Cecilia Day, would call Annie very loud.  I wonder\nMrs Willis can endure her.  Mrs Willis seems so ladylike herself,\nbut--Oh, I beg your pardon, what's the matter?\"\n\nA very sharp voice had addressed itself to the idle Hester.\n\n\"But, mademoiselle, you are doing nothing!  This cannot for a moment be\npermitted.  Pardonnez-moi, you know not the French?  Here is a little\neasy lesson.  Study it, mademoiselle, and don't let your eyes wander a\nmoment from the page.\"\n\nHester favoured Mdlle.  Perier with a look of lofty contempt, but she\nreceived the well-thumbed lesson-book in absolute silence.\n\nAt eight o'clock came breakfast, which was nicely served, and was very\ngood and abundant.  Hester was thoroughly hungry this morning, and did\nnot feel so shy as the night before.  She found herself seated between\ntwo strange girls, who talked to her a little and would have made\nthemselves friendly had she at all encouraged them to do so.  After\nbreakfast came half an hour's recreation, when, the weather being very\nbad, the girls again assembled in the cosy play-room.  Hester looked\nround eagerly for Cecil Temple, who greeted her with a kind smile, but\ndid not ask her into her inclosure.  Annie Forest was not present, and\nHester breathed a sigh of relief at her absence.  The half-hour devoted\nto recreation proved rather dull to the newcomer.  Hester could not\nunderstand her present world.  To the girl who had been brought up\npractically as an only child in the warm shelter of a home, the ways and\ndoings of school-girl life were an absolute enigma.\n\nHester had no idea of unbending or of making herself agreeable.  The\ngirls voted her to one another stiff and tiresome, and quickly left her\nto her own devices.  She looked longingly at Cecil Temple; but Cecil,\nwho could never be knowingly unkind to any one, was seizing the precious\nmoments to write a letter to her father, and Hester presently wandered\ndown the room and tried to take an interest in the little ones.  From\ntwelve to fifteen quite little children were in the school, and Hester\nwondered with a sort of vague half-pain if she might see any child among\nthe group the least like Nan.\n\n\"They will like to have me with them,\" she said to herself.  \"Poor\nlittle dots, they always like big girls to notice them, and didn't they\nmake a fuss about Miss Forest last night!  Well, Nan is fond enough of\nme, and little children find out so quickly what one is really like.\"\n\nHester walked boldly into the group.  The little dots were all as busy\nas bees, were not the least lonely, or the least shy, and very plainly\ngave the intruder to understand that they would prefer her room to her\ncompany.  Hester was not proud with little children--she loved them\ndearly.  Some of the smaller ones in question were beautiful little\ncreatures, and her heart warmed to them for Nan's sake.  She could not\nstoop to conciliate the older girls, but she could make an effort with\nthe babies.  She knelt on the floor and took up a headless doll.\n\n\"I know a little girl who had a doll like that,\" she said.\n\nHere she paused and several pairs of eyes were fixed on her.\n\n\"Poor dolly's b'oke,\" said the owner of the headless one in a tone of\ndeep commiseration.\n\n\"You _are_ such a breaker, you know, Annie,\" said Annie's little\nfive-year-old sister.\n\n\"Please tell us about the little girl what had the doll wifout the\nhead,\" she proceeded, glancing at Hester.\n\n\"Oh, it was taken to a hospital, and got back its head,\" said Hester\nquite cheerfully; \"it became quite well again, and was a more beautiful\ndoll than ever.\"\n\nThis announcement caused intense wonder and was certainly carrying the\ninterest of all the little ones.  Hester was deciding that the child who\npossessed the headless doll _had_ a look of Nan about her dark brown\neyes, when suddenly there was a diversion--the play-room door was opened\nnoisily, banged-to with a very loud report, and a gay voice sang out--\n\n\"The fairy queen has just paid me a visit.  Who wants sweeties from the\nfairy queen?\"\n\nInstantly all the little feet had scrambled to the perpendicular, each\npair of hands was clapped noisily, each little throat shouted a joyful--\n\n\"Here comes Annie!\"\n\nAnnie Forest was surrounded, and Hester knelt alone on the hearth-rug.\n\nShe felt herself colouring painfully--she did not fail to observe that\ntwo laughing eyes had fixed themselves with a momentary triumph on her\nface; then, snatching up a book, which happened to lie close, she seated\nherself with her back to all the girls, and her head bent over the page.\nIt is quite doubtful whether she saw any of the words, but she was at\nleast determined not to cry.\n\nThe half-hour so wearisome to poor Hester came to an end, and the girls,\nconducted by Miss Danesbury, filed into the school-room and took their\nplaces in the different classes.\n\nWork had now begun in serious earnest.  The school-room presented an\nanimated and busy scene.  The young faces with their varying expressions\nbetokened on the whole the preponderance of an earnest spirit.\nDiscipline, not too severe, reigned triumphant.\n\nHester was not yet appointed to any place among these busy workers, but\nwhile she stood wondering, a little confused, and half intending to drop\ninto an empty seat which happened to be close, Miss Danesbury came up to\nher.\n\n\"Follow me, Miss Thornton,\" she said, and she conducted the young girl\nup the whole length of the great school-room, and pushed aside some\nbaize curtains which concealed a second smaller room, where Mrs Willis\nsat before a desk.\n\nThe head-mistress was no longer dressed in soft pearl-grey and Mechlin\nlace.  She wore a black silk dress, and her white cap seemed to Hester\nto add a severe tone to her features.  She neither shook hands with the\nnew pupil nor kissed her, but said instantly in a bright though\nauthoritative tone--\n\n\"I must now find out as quickly as possible what you know, Hester, in\norder to place you in the most suitable class.\"  Hester was a clever\ngirl, and passed through the ordeal of a rather stiff examination with\nconsiderable ability.  Mrs Willis pronounced her English and general\ninformation quite up to the usual standard for girls of her age--her\nFrench was deficient, but she showed some talent for German.\n\n\"On the whole I am pleased with your general intelligence, and I think\nyou have good capacities, Hester,\" she said in conclusion.  \"I shall ask\nMiss Good, our very accomplished English teacher, to place you in the\nthird-class.  You will have to work very hard, however, at your French,\nto maintain your place there.  But Mdlle.  Perier is kind and\npainstaking, and it rests with yourself to quickly acquire a\nconversational acquaintance with the language.  You are aware that,\nexcept during recreation, you are never allowed to speak in any other\ntongue.  Now, go back to the school-room, my dear.\"\n\nAs Mrs Willis spoke she laid her finger on a little silver gong which\nstood by her side.\n\n\"One moment, please,\" said Hester, colouring crimson, \"I want to ask you\na question, please.\"\n\n\"Is it about your lessons?\"\n\n\"No--oh, no; it is--\"\n\n\"Then pardon me, my dear,\" uttered the governess, \"I sit in my room\nevery evening from eight to half-past, and I am then at liberty to see a\npupil on any subject which is not trifling.  Nothing but lessons are\nspoken of in lesson hours, Hester.  Ah, here comes Miss Good.  Miss\nGood, I should wish you to place Hester Thornton in the third-class.\nHer English is up to the average.  I will see Mdlle.  Perier about her\nat twelve o'clock.\"\n\nHester followed the English teacher into the great school-room, took her\nplace in the third-class, at the desk which was pointed out to her, was\ngiven a pile of new books, and was asked to attend to the history lesson\nwhich was then going on.\n\nNotwithstanding her confusion, a certain sense of soreness, and some\nindignation at what she considered Mrs Willis's altered manner, she\nacquitted herself with considerable spirit, and was pleased to see that\nher class companions regarded her with some respect.\n\nAn English literature lecture followed the history, and here again\nHester acquitted herself with _eclat_.  The subject to-day was \"Julius\nCaesar,\" and Hester had read Shakespeare's play over many times with her\nmother.\n\nBut when the hour came for foreign languages, her brief triumph ceased.\nLower and lower did she fall in her school-fellows' estimation, as she\nstumbled through her truly English-French.  Mdlle.  Perier, who was a\nvery fiery little woman, almost screamed at her--the girls coloured and\nnearly tittered.  Hester hoped to recover her lost laurels in German,\nbut by this time her head ached, and she did very little better in the\nGerman which she loved than in the French which she detested.  At twelve\no'clock she was relieved to find that school was over for the present,\nand she heard the English teacher's voice desiring the girls to go\nquickly to their rooms, and to assemble in five minutes' time in the\ngreat stone hall, equipped for their walk.\n\nThe walk lasted for a little over an hour, and was a very dreary penance\nto poor Hester, as she was neither allowed to run, race, nor talk a word\nof English.  She sighed heavily once or twice, and several of the girls\nwho looked at her curiously agreed with Annie Forest that she was\ndecidedly sulky.  The walk was followed by dinner; then came half an\nhour of recreation in the delightful play-room, and eager chattering in\nthe English tongue.\n\nAt three o'clock the school assembled once more; but now the studies\nwere of a less severe character, and Hester spent one of her first happy\nhalf-hours over a drawing lesson.  She had a great love for drawing, and\nfelt some pride in the really beautiful copy which she was making of the\nstump of an old gnarled oak-tree.  Her dismay, however, was\nproportionately great when the drawing-master drew his pencil right\nacross her copy.\n\n\"I particularly requested you not to sketch in any of the shadows, Miss\nThornton.  Did you not hear me say that my lesson to-day was in outline?\nI gave you a shaded piece to copy in outline--did you not understand?\"\n\n\"This is my first day at school,\" whispered back poor Hester, speaking\nin English in her distress.  Whereupon the master smiled, and even\nforgot to report her for her transgression of the French tongue.\n\nHester spent the rest of that afternoon over her music lesson.  The\nmusic-master was an irascible little German, but Hester played with some\ntaste, and was therefore not too severely rapped over the knuckles.\n\nThen came tea and another half-hour of recreation, which was followed by\ntwo silent hours in the school-room, each girl bent busily over her\nbooks in preparation for the next day's work.  Hester studied hard, for\nshe had made up her mind to be the intellectual prodigy of the school.\nEven on this first day, miserable as it was, she had won a few plaudits\nfor her quickness and powers of observation.  How much better could she\nwork when she had really fallen into the tone of the school, and\nunderstood the lessons which she was now so carefully preparing!  During\nher busy day she had failed to notice one thing: namely, the absence of\nAnnie Forest.  Annie had not been in the school-room, had not been in\nthe play-room; but now, as the clock struck eight, she entered the\nschool-room with a listless expression, and took her place in the same\nclass with Hester.  Her eyes were heavy, as if she had been crying, and\nwhen a companion touched her, and gave her a sympathising glance, she\nshook her head with a sorrowful gesture, but did not speak.  Glasses of\nmilk and slices of bread and butler were now handed round to the girls,\nand Miss Danesbury asked if any one would like to see Mrs Willis before\nprayers.  Hester half sprang to her feet, but then sat down again.  Mrs\nWillis had annoyed her by refusing to break her rules and answer her\nquestion during lesson hours.  No, the silly child resolved that she\nwould not trouble Mrs Willis now.\n\n\"No one to-night, then?\" said Miss Danesbury, who had noticed Hester's\nmovement.\n\nSuddenly Annie Forest sprang to her feet.\n\n\"I'm going, Miss Danesbury,\" she said.  \"You need not show me the way; I\ncan find it alone.\"\n\nWith her short, curly hair falling about her face, she ran out of the\nroom.\n\nCHAPTER 8. \"YOU HAVE WOKEN ME TOO SOON.\"\n\nWhen Hester reached her bedroom after prayers on that second evening,\nshe was dismayed to find that she no longer could consider the pretty\nlittle bedroom her own.  It had not only an occupant, but an occupant\nwho had left untidy traces of her presence on the floor, for a stocking\nlay in one direction and a muddy boot sprawled in another.  The newcomer\nhad herself got into bed, where she lay with a quantity of red hair\ntossed about on the pillow, and a heavy freckled face turned upward,\nwith the eyes shut and the mouth slightly open.\n\nAs Hester entered the room, from these parted lips came unmistakable and\nloud snores.  She stood still dismayed.\n\n\"How terrible!\" she said to herself--\"oh, what a girl! and I cannot\nsleep in the room with any one who snores--I really cannot!\"\n\nShe stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped before her, and her\neyes fixed with almost ludicrous dismay on this unexpected trial.  As\nshe gazed, a fresh discovery caused her to utter an exclamation of\nhorror aloud.\n\nThe newcomer had curled herself up comfortably in _her_ bed.  Suddenly,\nto her surprise, a voice said very quietly, without a flicker of\nexpression coming over the calm face, or the eyes even making an effort\nto open--\n\n\"Are you my new school-mate?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hester, \"I am sorry to say I am.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be sorry, there's a good creature; there's nothing to be\nsorry about.  I'll stop snoring when I turn on my side--it's all right.\nI always snore for half an hour to rest my back, and the time is nearly\nup.  Don't trouble me to open my eyes, I am not the least curious to see\nyou.  You have a cross voice, but you'll get used to me after a bit.\"\n\n\"But you're in my bed,\" said Hester.  \"Will you please to get into your\nown?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, don't ask me; I like your bed best.  I slept in it the whole of\nlast term.  I changed the sheets myself, so it does not matter.  Do you\nmind putting my muddy boots outside the door, and folding up my\nstockings?  I forgot them, and I shall have a bad mark if Danesbury\ncomes in.  Good-night--I'm turning on my side--I won't snore any more.\"\n\nThe heavy face was now only seen in profile, and Hester, knowing that\nMiss Danesbury would soon appear to put out the candle, had to hurry\ninto the other bed as fast as she could; something impelled her,\nhowever, to take up the muddy boots with two very gingerly fingers, and\nplace them outside the door.\n\nShe slept better this second night, and was not quite so startled the\nnext morning when the remorseless gong aroused her from slumber.  The\nmaid-servant came in as usual to light the candles, and to place two\ncans of hot water by the two wash-handstands.\n\n\"You are awake, miss?\" she said to Hester.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Hester almost cheerfully.\n\n\"Well, that's all right,\" said the servant.  \"Now I must try and rouse\nMiss Drummond, and she always takes a deal of waking; and if you don't\nmind, miss, it will be an act of kindness to call out to her in the\nmiddle of your own dressing--that is, if I don't wake her effectual.\"\n\nWith these words, the housemaid approached the bed where the red-haired\ngirl lay again on her back, and again snoring loudly.\n\n\"Miss Drummond, wake, miss; it's half-past six.  Wake up, miss--I have\nbrought your hot water.\"\n\n\"Eh?--what?\" said the voice in the bed sleepily; \"don't bother me,\nHannah--I--I've determined not to ride this morning; go away--\" then\nmore sleepily, and in a lower key, \"Tell Percy he can't bring the dogs\nin here.\"\n\n\"I ain't neither your Hannah, nor your Percy, nor one of the dogs,\"\nreplied the rather irate Alice--\"There, get up, miss, do.  I never see\nsuch a young lady for sleeping, never.\"\n\n\"I won't be bothered,\" said the occupant of the bed, and now she turned\ndeliberately on her side and snored more loudly than ever.\n\n\"There's no help for it,\" said Alice: \"I have to do it nearly every\nmorning, so don't you be startled, miss.  Poor thing, she would never\nhave a good conduct mark but for me.  Now then, here goes.  You needn't\nbe frightened, miss--she don't mind it the least bit in the world.\"\n\nHere Alice seized a rough Turkish towel, placed it under the sleepy head\nwith its shock of red hair, and, dipping a sponge in a basin of icy cold\nwater, dashed it on the white face.\n\nThis remedy proved effectual; two large pale blue eyes opened wide, a\nvoice said in a tranquil and unmoved tone--\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Alice.  So I'm back at this horrid, detestable school\nagain?\"\n\n\"Get your feet well on the carpet, Miss Drummond, before you falls off\nagain,\" said the servant.  \"Now then, you'd better get dressed as fast\nas possible, miss--you have lost five minutes already.\"\n\nHester, who had laughed immoderately during this little scene, was\nalready up and going through the processes of her toilet.  Miss\nDrummond, seated on the edge of her bed, regarded her with sleepy eyes.\n\n\"So you are my new room-mate?\" she said--\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Hester Thornton,\" replied Hetty with dignity.\n\n\"Oh--I'm Susy Drummond--you may call me Susy if you like.\"\n\nHester made no response to this gracious invitation.\n\nMiss Drummond sat motionless, gazing down at her toes.\n\n\"Had not you better get dressed?\" said Hester after a long pause, for\nshe really feared the young lady would fall asleep where she was\nsitting.\n\nMiss Drummond started.\n\n\"Dressed!  So I will, dear creature.  Have the sweet goodness to hand me\nmy clothes.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" asked Hester rather crossly, for she did not care to\nact as lady's-maid.\n\n\"They are over there, on a chair, in that lovely heap with a shawl flung\nover them.  There, toss them this way--I'll get into them somehow.\"\n\nMiss Drummond did manage to get into her garments; but her whole\nappearance was so heavy and untidy when she was dressed, that Hester by\nthe very force of contrast felt obliged to take extra pains with her own\ntoilet.\n\n\"Now, that's a comfort,\" said Susan, \"I'm in my clothes.  How bitter it\nis!  There's one comfort, the chapel will be warm.  I often catch forty\nwinks in chapel--that is, if I'm lucky enough to get behind one of the\ntall girls, where Mrs Willis won't see me.  It does seem to me,\"\ncontinued Susan in a meditative tone, \"the strangest thing why girls are\nnot allowed sleep enough.\"\n\nHester was pinning a clean collar round her neck when Miss Drummond came\nup close, leaned over the dressing-table, and regarded her with languid\ncuriosity.\n\n\"A penny for your thoughts.  Miss Prunes and Prism.\"\n\n\"Why do you call me that?\" said Hester angrily.\n\n\"Because you look like it, sweet.  Now, don't be cross, little pet--no\none ever yet was cross with sleepy Susy Drummond.  Now, tell me, love,\nwhat had you for breakfast yesterday?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I forget,\" said Hester.\n\n\"You _forget_?--how extraordinary!  You're sure that it was not buttered\nscones?  We have them sometimes, and I tell you they are enough even to\nkeep a girl awake.  Well, at least you can let me know if the eggs were\nvery stale, and the coffee very weak, and whether the butter was\nsecond-rate Dorset, or good and fresh.  Come now--my breakfast is of\nimmense importance to me, I assure you.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" answered Hester.  \"You can see for yourself this morning\nwhat is on the table--I can only inform you that it was good enough for\nme, and that I don't remember what it was.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Susan Drummond, \"I'm afraid she has a little\ntemper of her own--poor little room-mate.  I wonder if chocolate-creams\nwould sweeten that little temper?\"\n\n\"Please don't talk--I'm going to say my prayers,\" said Hester.\n\nShe did kneel down, and made a slight effort to ask God to help her\nthrough the day's work and the day's play.  In consequence, she rose\nfrom her knees with a feeling of strength and sweetness which even the\nfeeblest prayer when uttered in earnest can always give.\n\nThe prayer-gong now sounded, and all the girls assembled in the chapel.\nMiss Drummond was greeted by many appreciative nods, and more than one\npair of longing eyes gazed in the direction of her pockets, which stuck\nout in the most ungainly fashion.\n\nHester was relieved to find that her room-mate did not share her class\nin school, nor sit anywhere near her at table.\n\nWhen the half-hour's recreation after breakfast arrived, Hester,\ndetermined to be beholden to none of her school-mates for companionship,\nseated herself comfortably in an easy chair, with a new book.  Presently\nshe was startled by a little stream of lollipops falling in a shower\nover her head, down her neck, and into her lap.  She started up with an\nexpression of disgust.  Instantly Miss Drummond sank into the vacated\nchair.\n\n\"Thank you, love,\" she said, in a cosy, purring voice.  \"Eat your\nlollipops, and look at me; I'm going to sleep.  Please pull my toe when\nDanesbury comes in.  Oh, fie!  Prunes and Prisms--not so cross--eat your\nlollipops; they will sweeten the expression of that--little--face.\"\n\nThe last words came out drowsily.  As she said \"face,\" Miss Drummond's\nlanguid eyes were closed--she was fast asleep.\n\nCHAPTER 9. WORK AND PLAY.\n\nIn a few days Hester was accustomed to her new life.  She fell into its\nroutine, and in a certain measure won the respect of her fellow-pupils.\nShe worked hard, and kept her place in class, and her French became a\nlittle more like the French tongue and a little less like the English.\nShe showed marked ability in many of her other studies, and the\nmistresses and masters spoke well of her.  After a fortnight spent at\nLavender House, Hester had to acknowledge that the little Misses Bruce\nwere right, and that school might be a really enjoyable place for some\ngirls.  She would not yet admit that it could be enjoyable for her.\nHester was too shy, too proud, too exacting to be popular with her\nschool-fellows.  She knew nothing of school-girl life--she had never\nlearned the great secret of success in all life's perplexities, the\npower to give and take.  It never occurred to Hester to look over a\nhasty word, to take no notice of an envious or insolent look.  As far as\nher lessons were concerned she was doing well; but the hardest lesson of\nall, the training of mind and character, which the daily companionship\nof her school-fellows alone could give her, in this lesson she was\nmaking no way.  Each day she was shutting herself up more and more from\nall kindly advances, and the only one in the school whom she sincerely\nand cordially liked was gentle Cecil Temple.\n\nMrs Willis had some ideas with regard to the training of her young\npeople which were peculiarly her own.  She had found them successful,\nand, during her thirty years' experience, had never seen reason to alter\nthem.  She was determined to give her girls a great deal more liberty\nthan was accorded in most of the boarding-schools of her day.  She never\nmade what she called impossible rules; she allowed the girls full\nliberty to chatter in their bedrooms; she did not watch them during\nplay-hours; she never read the letters they received, and only\nsuperintended the specimen home letter which each girl was required to\nwrite once a month.  Other head-mistresses wondered at the latitude she\nallowed her girls, but she invariably replied--\n\n\"I always find it works best to trust them.  If a girl is found to be\nutterly untrustworthy.  I don't expel her, but I request her parents to\nremove her to a more strict school.\"\n\nMrs Willis also believed much in that quiet half-hour each evening,\nwhen the girls who cared to come could talk to her alone.  On these\noccasions she always dropped the school-mistress and adopted the _role_\nof the mother.  With a very refractory pupil she spoke in the tenderest\ntones of remonstrance and affection at these times.  If her words\nfailed--if the discipline of the day and the gentle sympathy of these\nmoments at night did not effect their purpose, she had yet another\nexpedient--the vicar was asked to see the girl who would not yield to\nthis motherly influence.\n\nMr Everard had very seldom taken Mrs Willis's place.  As he said to\nher, \"Your influence must be the mainspring.  At supreme moments I will\nhelp you with personal influence, but otherwise, except for my nightly\nprayers with your girls, and my weekly class, and the teachings which\nthey with others hear from my lips Sunday after Sunday, they had better\nlook to you.\"\n\nThe girls knew this rule well, and the one or two rare instances in the\nschool history where the vicar had stepped in to interfere, were spoken\nof with bated breath and with intense awe.\n\nMrs Willis had a great idea of bringing as much happiness as possible\ninto young lives.  It was with this idea that she had the quaint little\ncompartments railed off in the play-room.\n\n\"For the elder girls,\" she would say, \"there is no pleasure so great as\nhaving, however small the spot, a little liberty hall of their own.  In\nher compartment each girl is absolute monarch.  No one can enter inside\nthe little curtained rail without her permission.  Here she can show her\nindividual taste, her individual ideas.  Here she can keep her\nmost-prized possessions.  In short, her compartment in the play-room is\na little home to her.\"\n\nThe play-room, large as it was, admitted of only twenty compartments;\nthese compartments were not easily won.  No amount of cleverness\nattained them; they were altogether dependent on conduct.  No girl could\nbe the honourable owner of her own little drawing-room until she had\ndistinguished herself by some special act of kindness and self-denial.\nMrs Willis had no fixed rule on this subject.  She alone gave away the\ncompartments, and she often made choice of girls on whom she conferred\nthis honour in a way which rather puzzled and surprised their fellows.\n\nWhen the compartment was won it was not a secure possession.  To retain\nit depended also on conduct; and here again Mrs Willis was absolute in\nher sway.  More than once the girls had entered the room in the morning\nto find some favourite's furniture removed and her little possessions\ntaken carefully down from the walls, the girl herself alone knowing the\nreason for this sudden change.  Annie Forest, who had been at Lavender\nHouse for four years, had once, for a solitary month of her existence,\nowned her own special drawing-room.  She had obtained it as a reward for\nan act of heroism.  One of the little pupils had set her pinafore on\nfire.  There was no teacher present at the moment--the other girls had\nscreamed and run for help, but Annie, very pale, had caught the little\none in her arms and had crushed out the flames with her own hands.  The\nchild's life was spared, the child was not even hurt, but Annie was in\nthe hospital for a week.  At the end of a week she returned to the\nschool-room and play-room as the heroine of the hour.  Mrs Willis\nherself kissed her brow, and presented her in the midst of the approving\nsmiles of her companions with the prettiest drawing-room of the sets.\nAnnie retained her honourable post for one month.\n\nNever did the girls of Lavender House forget the delights of that month.\nThe fantastic arrangements of the little drawing-room filled them with\necstasies.  Annie was truly Japanese in her style--she was also\nintensely liberal in all her arrangements.  In the tiny space of this\nlittle inclosure wild pranks were perpetrated, ceaseless jokes made up.\nFrom Annie's drawing-room issued peals of exquisite mirth.  She gave\nafternoon tea from a Japanese set of tea-things.  Outside her\ndrawing-room always collected a crowd of girls, who tried to peep over\nthe rail or to draw aside the curtains.  Inside the sacred spot\ncertainly reigned chaos, and one day Miss Danesbury had to fly to the\nrescue, for in a fit of mad mirth Annie herself had knocked down the\nlittle Japanese tea-table, the tea-pot and tea-things were in fragments\non the floor, and the tea and milk poured in streams outside the\ncurtains.  Mrs Willis sent for Annie that evening, and Miss Forest\nretired from her interview with red eyes and a meek expression.\n\n\"Girls,\" she said, in confidence that night, \"good-bye to Japan.  I gave\nher leave to do it--the care of an empire is more than I can manage.\"\n\nThe next day the Japanese drawing-room had been handed over to another\npossessor, and Annie reigned as queen over her empire no more.\n\nMrs Willis, anxious at all times that her girls should be happy, made\nspecial arrangements for their benefit on Sunday.  Sunday was by no\nmeans dull at Lavender House--Sunday was totally unlike the six days\nwhich followed it.  Even the stupidest girl could scarcely complain of\nthe severity of Sunday lessons--even the merriest girl could scarcely\nspeak of the day as dull.  Mrs Willis made an invariable rule of\nspending all Sunday with her pupils.  On this day she really unbent--on\nthis day she was all during the long hours, what she was during the\nshort half-hour on each evening in the week.  On Sunday she neither\nreproved nor corrected.  If punishment or correction were necessary, she\ndeputed Miss Good or Miss Danesbury to take her place.  On Sunday she\nsat with the little children round her knee, and the older girls\nclustering about her.  Her gracious and motherly face was like a sun\nshining in the midst of these young girls.  In short, she was like the\npersonified form of Goodness in their midst.  It was necessary,\ntherefore, that all those who wished to do right should be happy on\nSunday, and only those few who deliberately preferred evil should shrink\nfrom the brightness of this day.\n\nIt is astonishing how much a sympathising and guiding spirit can effect.\nThe girls at Lavender House thought Sunday the shortest day in the\nweek.  There were no unoccupied or dull moments--school toil was\nforgotten--school punishment ceased, to be resumed again if necessary on\nMonday morning.  The girls in their best dresses could chatter freely in\nEnglish--they could read their favourite books--they could wander about\nthe house as they pleased: for on Sunday the two baize doors were always\nwide-open, and Mrs Willis's own private suite of rooms was ready to\nreceive them.  If the day was fine they walked to church, each choosing\nher own companion for the pleasant walk; if the day was wet there was\nservice in the chapel, Mr Everard always conducting either morning or\nevening prayers.  In the afternoon the girls were allowed to do pretty\nmuch as they pleased, but after tea there always came a delightful hour,\nwhen the elder girls retired with their mistress into her own special\nboudoir, and she either told them stories or sang to them as only she\ncould sing.  At sixty years of age Mrs Willis still possessed the most\nsympathetic and touching voice those girls had ever listened to.  Hester\nThornton broke down completely on her first Sunday at Lavender House\nwhen she heard her school-mistress sing \"The Better Land.\"  No one\nremarked on her tears, but two people saw them; for her mistress kissed\nher tenderly that night, and said a few strong words of help and\nencouragement, and Annie Forest, who made no comment, had also seen\nthem, and wondered vaguely if this new and disagreeable pupil had a\nheart after all.\n\nOn Sunday night Mrs Willis herself went round to each little bed and\ngave a mother-kiss to each of her pupils--a mother-kiss and a murmured\nblessing; and in many breasts resolves were then formed which were to\nhelp the girls through the coming week.  Some of these resolves, made\nnot in their own strength, bore fruit in long after-years.  There is no\ndoubt that very few girls who lived long enough at Lavender House ever\nin after-days found their Sundays dull.\n\nCHAPTER 10. VARIETIES.\n\nWithout any doubt, wild, naughty, impulsive Annie Forest was the most\npopular girl in the school.  She was always in scrapes--she was scarcely\never out of hot water--her promises of amendment were truly like the\nproverbial pie-crust: but she was so lovable, so kind-hearted, so saucy\nand piquant and pretty, that very few could resist the nameless charm\nwhich she possessed.  The little ones adored Annie, who was kindness\nitself to them; the bigger girls could not help admiring her\nfearlessness and courage; the best and noblest girls in the school tried\nto influence her for good.  She was more or less an object of interest\nto every one; her courage was of just the sort to captivate\nschool-girls, and her moral weakness was not observed by these\ninexperienced young eyes.\n\nHester alone, of all the girls who for a long time had come to Lavender\nHouse, failed to see any charm in Annie.  She began by considering her\nill-bred, and when she found she was the school favourite, she tossed\nher proud little head and determined that she for one would never be\nsubjugated by such a naughty girl.  Hester could read character with\ntolerable clearness; she was an observant child--very observant, and\nvery thoughtful for her twelve years; and as the little witch Annie had\nfailed to throw any spell over her, she saw her faults far more clearly\nthan did her companions.  There is no doubt that this brilliant,\ncharming, and naughty Annie had heaps of faults; she had no\nperseverance; she was all passion and impulse; she could be the kindest\nof the kind, but from sheer thoughtlessness and wildness she often\ninflicted severe pain, even on those she loved best.  Annie very nearly\nworshipped Mrs Willis, she had the most intense adoration for her, she\nrespected her beyond any other human being.  There were moments when the\nimpulsive and hot-headed child felt that she could gladly lay down her\nlife for her school-mistress.  Once the mistress was ill, and Annie\ncurled herself up all night outside her door, thereby breaking rules,\nand giving herself a severe cold; but her passion and agony were so\ngreat that she could only be soothed by at last stealing into the\ndarkened room and kissing the face she loved.\n\n\"Prove your love to me, Annie, by going downstairs and keeping the\nschool rules as perfectly as possible,\" whispered the teacher.\n\n\"I will--I will never break a rule again as long as I live, if you get\nbetter, Mrs Willis,\" responded the child.\n\nShe ran downstairs with her resolves strong within her, and yet in half\nan hour she was reprimanded for wilful and desperate disobedience.\n\nOne day Cecil Temple had invited a select number of friends to afternoon\ntea in her little drawing-room.  It was the Wednesday half-holiday, and\nCecil's tea, poured into the tiniest cups and accompanied by thin wafer\nbiscuits, was of the most _recherche_ quality.  Cecil had invited Hester\nThornton, and a tall girl who belonged to the first-class and whose name\nwas Dora Russell, to partake of this dainty beverage.  They were sitting\nround the tiny tea-table, on little red stools with groups of flowers\nartistically painted on them, and were all three conducting themselves\nin a most ladylike and refined manner, when Annie Forest's curly head\nand saucy face popped over the inclosure, and her voice said eagerly--\n\n\"Oh, may I be permitted to enter the shrine?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Annie,\" said Cecil, in her most cordial tones.  \"I have got\nanother cup and saucer, and there is a little tea left in the tea-pot.\"\n\nAnnie came in, and ensconced herself cosily on the floor.  It did not\nmatter in the least to her that Hester Thornton's brow grew dark, and\nthat Miss Russell suddenly froze into complete indifference to all her\nsurroundings.  Annie was full of a subject which excited her very much;\nshe had suddenly discovered that she wanted to give Mrs Willis a\npresent, and she wished to know if any of the girls would like to join\nher.\n\n\"I will give her the present this day week,\" said excitable Annie.  \"I\nhave quite made up my mind.  Will any one join me?\"\n\n\"But there is nothing special about this day week, Annie,\" said Miss\nTemple.  \"It will neither be Mrs Willis's birthday, nor Christmas Day,\nnor New Year's Day, nor Easter Day.  Next Wednesday will be just like\nany other Wednesday.  Why should we make Mrs Willis a present?\"\n\n\"Oh, because she looks as if she wanted one, poor dear.  I thought she\nlooked sad this morning; her eyes drooped and her mouth was down at the\ncorners.  I am sure she's wanting something from us all by now, just to\nshow that we love her, you know.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" here burst from Hester's lips.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" said Annie, turning round with her bright eyes\nflashing.  \"You've no right to be so contemptuous when I speak about\nour--our head-mistress.  Oh, Cecil,\" she continued, \"do let us give her\na little surprise--some spring flowers, or something just to show her\nthat we love her.\"\n\n\"But _you_ don't love her,\" said Hester, stoutly.\n\nHere was throwing down the gauntlet with a vengeance!  Annie sprang to\nher feet and confronted Hester with a whole torrent of angry words.\nHester firmly maintained her position.  She said over and over again\nthat love proved itself by deeds, not by words; that if Annie learned\nher lessons, and obeyed the school rules, she would prove her affection\nfor Mrs Willis far more than by empty protestations.  Hester's words\nwere true, but they were uttered in an unkind spirit, and the very\nflavour of truth which they possessed caused them to enter Annie's heart\nand to wound her deeply.  She turned, not red, but very white, and her\nlarge and lovely eyes grew misty with unshed tears.\n\n\"You are cruel,\" she gasped, rather than spoke, and then she pushed\naside the curtains of Cecil's compartment and walked out of the\nplay-room.\n\nThere was a dead silence among the three girls when she left them.\nHester's heart was still hot, and she was still inclined to maintain her\nown position, and to believe she had done right in speaking in so severe\na tone to Annie.  But even she had been made a little uneasy by the look\nof deep suffering which had suddenly transformed Annie's charming\nchildish face into that of a troubled and pained woman.  She sat down\nmeekly on her little three-legged stool and, taking up her tiny cup and\nsaucer, sipped some of the cold tea.\n\nCecil Temple was the first to speak.\n\n\"How could you?\" she said, in an indignant voice for her.  \"Annie is not\nthe girl to be driven, and, in any case, it is not for you to correct\nher.  Oh, Mrs Willis would have been so pained had she heard you--you\nwere not _kind_, Miss Thornton.  There, I don't wish to be rude, but I\nfear I must leave you and Miss Russell--I must try and find Annie.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to my own drawing-room,\" said Miss Russell, rising to\nher feet.  \"Perhaps,\" she added, turning round with a very gracious\nsmile to Hester, \"you will come and see me there, after tea, this\nevening.\"\n\nMiss Russell drew aside the curtains of Cecil Temple's little room, and\ndisappeared.  Hester, with her eyes full of tears, now turned eagerly to\nCecil.\n\n\"Forgive me, Cecil,\" she exclaimed.  \"I did not mean to be unkind, but\nit is really quite ridiculous the way you all spoil that girl--you know\nas well as I do that she is a very naughty girl.  I suppose it is\nbecause of her pretty face,\" continued Hester, \"that you are all so\nunjust, and so blind to her faults.\"\n\n\"You are prejudiced the other way, Hester,\" said Cecil in a more gentle\ntone.  \"You have disliked Annie from the first.  There, don't keep me--I\nmust go to her now.  There is no knowing what harm your words may have\ndone.  Annie is not like other girls.  If you knew her story, you would\nperhaps be kinder to her.\"\n\nCecil then ran out of her drawing-room, leaving Hester in sole\npossession of the little tea-things and the three-legged stools.  She\nsat and thought for some time; she was a girl with a great deal of\nobstinacy in her nature, and she was not disposed to yield her own\npoint, even to Cecil Temple; but Cecil's words had, nevertheless, made\nsome impression on her.\n\nAt tea-time that night, Annie and Cecil entered the room together.\nAnnie's eyes were as bright as stars, and her usually pale cheeks glowed\nwith a deep colour.  She had never looked prettier--she had never looked\nso defiant, so mischievous, so utterly reckless.  Mdlle.  Perier fired\nindignant French at her across the table.  Annie answered respectfully,\nand became demure in a moment; but even in the short instant in which\nthe governess was obliged to lower her eyes to her plate, she had thrown\na look so irresistibly comic at her companions, that several of them had\ntittered aloud.  Not once did she glance at Hester although she\noccasionally looked boldly in her direction; but when she did so, her\nversatile face assumed a blank expression, as if she were seeing\nnothing.  When tea was over, Dora Russell surprised the members of her\nown class by walking straight up to Hester, putting her hand inside her\narm, and leading her off to her own very refined-looking little\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"I want to tell you,\" she said, when the two girls found themselves\ninside the small inclosure, \"that I quite agree with you in your opinion\nof Miss Forest.  I think you were very brave to speak to her as you did\nto-day.  As a rule, I never trouble myself with what the little girls in\nthe third-class do, and of course Annie seldom comes under my notice;\nbut I think she is a decidedly spoiled child, and your rebuff will\ndoubtless do her a great deal of good.\"\n\nThese words of commendation, coming from tall and dignified Miss\nRussell, completely turned poor Hester's head.\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad you think so!\" she stammered, colouring high with\npleasure.  \"You see,\" she added, assuming a little tone of extra\nrefinement, \"at home I always associated with girls who were perfect\nladies.\"\n\n\"Yes, any one can see that,\" remarked Miss Russell approvingly.\n\n\"And I do think Annie underbred,\" continued Hester.  \"I cannot\nunderstand,\" she added, \"why Miss Temple likes her so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cecil is so amiable; she sees good in every one,\" answered Miss\nRussell.  \"Annie is evidently not a lady, and I am glad at last to find\nsome one of the girls who belong to the middle school capable of\ndiscerning this fact.  Of course, we of the first-class have nothing\nwhatever to say to Miss Forest, but I really think Mrs Willis is not\nacting quite fairly by the other girls when she allows a young person of\nthat description into the school.  I wish to assure you, Miss Thornton,\nthat you have at least my sympathy, and I shall be very pleased to see\nyou in my drawing-room now and then.\"\n\nAs these last words were uttered, both girls were conscious of a little\nrustling sound not far away.  Miss Russell drew back her curtain, and\nasked very sharply, \"Who is there?\" but no one replied, nor was there\nany one in sight, for the girls who did not possess compartments were\ncongregated at the other end of the long play-room, listening to stories\nwhich Emma Marshall, a clever elder girl, was relating for their\nbenefit.\n\nMiss Russell talked on indifferent subjects to Hester, and at the end of\nthe half-hour the two entered the class-room side by side, Hester's\nlittle head a good deal turned by this notice from one of the oldest\ngirls in the school.\n\nAs the two walked together into the school-room, Susan Drummond, who,\ntall as she was, was only in the fourth class, rushed up to Miss Forest,\nand whispered something in her ear.\n\n\"It is just as I told you,\" she said, and her sleepy voice was quite\nwide awake and animated.  Annie Forest rewarded her by a playful pinch\non her cheek; then she returned to her own class, with a severe\nreprimand from the class teacher, and silence reigned in the long room,\nas the girls began to prepare their lessons as usual for the next day.\n\nMiss Russell took her place at her desk in her usual dignified manner.\nShe was a clever girl, and was going to leave school at the end of next\nterm.  Hers was a particularly fastidious, but by no means great\nnature--she was the child of wealthy parents, she was also well-born,\nand because of her money, and a certain dignity and style which had come\nto her as nature's gifts, she held an influence, though by no means a\nlarge one, in the school.  No one particularly disliked her, but no one,\nagain, ardently loved her.  The girls in her own class thought it well\nto be friendly with Dora Russell, and Dora accepted their homage with\nmore or less indifference.  She did not greatly care for either their\npraise or blame.  Dora possessed in a strong degree that baneful\nquality, which more than anything else precludes the love of others--she\nwas essentially selfish.\n\nShe sat now before her desk, little guessing how she had caused Hester's\nsmall heart to beat by her patronage, and little suspecting the mischief\nshe had done to the girl by her injudicious words.  Had she known, it is\nto be doubted whether she would have greatly cared.  She looked through\nthe books which contained her tasks for the next day's work, and,\nfinding they did not require a great deal of preparation, put them\naside, and amused herself during the rest of preparation time with a\nstory-book, which she artfully concealed behind the leaves of some\nexercises.  She knew she was breaking the rules, but this fact did not\ntrouble her, for her moral nature was, after all, no better than poor\nAnnie's, and she had not a tenth of her lovable qualities.\n\nDora Russell was the soul of neatness and order.  To look inside her\nschool-desk was a positive pleasure; to glance at her own neat and trim\nfigure was more or less of a delight.  Hers were the whitest hands in\nthe school, and hers the most perfectly kept and glossy hair.  As the\npreparation hour drew to a close, she replaced her exercises and books\nin exquisite order in her school-desk and shut down the lid.\n\nHester's eyes followed her as she walked out of the school-room, for the\nhead class never had supper with the younger girls.  Hester wondered if\nshe would glance in her direction; but Miss Russell had gratified a very\npassing whim when she condescended to notice and praise Hester, and she\nhad already almost forgotten her existence.\n\nAt bed-time that night Susan Drummond's behaviour was at the least\nextraordinary.  In the first place, instead of being almost\noverpoweringly friendly with Hester, she scarcely noticed her; in the\nnext place, she made some very peculiar preparations.\n\n\"What _are_ you doing on the floor, Susan?\" inquired Hetty in an\ninnocent tone.\n\n\"That's nothing to you,\" replied Miss Drummond, turning a dusky red, and\nlooking annoyed at being discovered.  \"I do wish,\" she added, \"that you\nwould go round to your side of the room and leave me alone; I sha'n't\nhave done what I want to do before Danesbury comes in to put out the\ncandle.\"\n\nHester was not going to put herself out with any of Susan Drummond's\nvagaries; she looked upon sleepy Susan as a girl quite beneath her\nnotice, but even she could not help observing her, when she saw her sit\nup in bed a quarter of an hour after the candles had been put out, and\nin the flickering firelight which shone conveniently bright for her\npurpose, fasten a piece of string first round one of her toes, and then\nto the end of the bed-post.\n\n\"What _are_ you doing?\" said Hester again, half laughing.\n\n\"Oh, what a spy you are!\" said Susan.  \"I want to wake, that's all; and\nwhenever I turn in bed that string will tug at my toe, and, of course,\nI'll rouse up.  If you were more good-natured, I'd give the other end of\nthe string to you; but, of course, that plan would never answer.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Hester; \"I am not going to trouble myself to wake\nyou.  You must trust to your sponge of cold water in the morning, unless\nyour own admirable device succeeds.\"\n\n\"I'm going to sleep now, at any rate,\" answered Susan; \"I'm on my back,\nand I'm beginning to snore; good-night.\"\n\nOnce or twice during the night Hester heard groans from the\nself-sacrificing Susan, who, doubtless, found the string attached to her\nfoot very inconvenient.\n\nHester, however, slept on when it might have been better for the peace\nof many in the school that she should have awakened.  She heard no sound\nwhen, long before day, sleepy Susan stepped softly out of bed, and\nwrapping a thick shawl about her, glided out of the room.  She was away\nfor over half an hour, but she returned to her chamber and got into bed\nwithout in the least disturbing Hester.  In the morning she was found so\nsoundly asleep that even the sponge of cold water could not arouse her.\n\n\"Pull the string at the foot of the bed, Alice,\" said Hester: \"she\nfastened a string to her toe, and twisted the other end round the\nbed-post, last night--pull it, Alice, it may effect its purpose.\"\n\nBut there was no string now round Susan Drummond's foot, nor was it\nfound hanging to the bed-post.\n\nCHAPTER 11. WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE SCHOOL-DESK.\n\nThe next morning, when the whole school were assembled, and all the\nclasses were getting ready for the real work of the day, Miss Good, the\nEnglish teacher, stepped to the head of the room, and, holding a neatly\nbound volume of \"Jane Eyre\" in her hand, begged to know to whom it\nbelonged.  There was a hush of astonishment when she held up the little\nbook, for all the girls knew well that this special volume was not\nallowed for school literature.\n\n\"The house maid who dusts the school-room found this book on the floor,\"\ncontinued the teacher.  \"It lay beside a desk near the top of the room.\nI see the name has been torn out, so I cannot tell who is the owner.  I\nmust request her, however, to step forward and take possession of her\nproperty.  If there is the slightest attempt at concealment, the whole\nmatter will be laid before Mrs Willis at noon to-day.\"\n\nWhen Miss Good had finished her little speech, she held up the book in\nits green binding and looked down the room.\n\nHester did not know why her heart beat--no one glanced at her, no one\nregarded her; all eyes were fixed on Miss Good, who stood with a severe,\nunsmiling, but expectant face.\n\n\"Come, young ladies,\" she said, \"the owner has surely no difficulty in\nrecognising her own property.  I give you exactly thirty seconds more;\nthen, if no one claims the book, I place the affair in Mrs Willis's\nhands.\"\n\nJust then there was a stir among the girls in the head class.  A tall\ngirl in dove-coloured cashmere, with a smooth head of golden hair, and a\nfair face which was a good deal flushed at this moment, stepped to the\nfront, and said in a clear and perfectly modulated voice--\n\n\"I had no idea of concealing the fact that `Jane Eyre' belongs to me.  I\nwas only puzzled for a moment to know how it got on the floor.  I placed\nit carefully in my desk last night.  I think this circumstance ought to\nbe inquired into.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" came from several suppressed voices here and there through the\nroom; \"whoever would have supposed that Dora Russell would be obliged to\nhumble herself in this way?\"\n\n\"Attention, young ladies!\" said Miss Good; \"no talking, if you please.\nDo I understand, Miss Russell, that `Jane Eyre' is yours?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Good.\"\n\n\"Why did you keep it in your desk--were you reading it during\npreparation?\"\n\n\"On, yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"You are, of course, aware that you were breaking two very stringent\nrules of the school.  In the first place, no story-books are allowed to\nbe concealed in a school-desk, or to be read during preparation.  In the\nsecond place, this special book is not allowed to be read at any time in\nLavender House.  You know these rules, Miss Russell?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Good.\"\n\n\"I must retain the book--you can return now to your place in class.\"\n\nMiss Russell bowed sedately, and with an apparently unmoved face, except\nfor the slightly deepened glow on her smooth cheek, resumed her\ninterrupted work.\n\nLessons went off as usual, but during recreation the mystery of the\ndiscovered book was largely discussed by the girls.  As is the custom of\nschool-girls, they took violent sides in the matter--some rejoicing in\nDora's downfall, some pitying her intensely.  Hester was, of course, one\nof Miss Russell's champions, and she looked at her with tender sympathy\nwhen she came with her haughty and graceful manner into the school-room,\nand her little heart beat with a vague hope that Dora might turn to her\nfor sympathy.\n\nDora, however, did nothing of the kind.  She refused to discuss the\naffair with her companions, and none of them quite knew what Mrs Willis\nsaid to her, or what special punishment was inflicted on the proud girl.\nSeveral of her school-fellows expected that Dora's drawing-room would\nbe taken away from her, but she still retained it; and after a few days\nthe affair of the book was almost forgotten.\n\nThere was, however, an uncomfortable and an uneasy spirit abroad in the\nschool.  Susan Drummond, who was certainly one of the most uninteresting\ngirls in Lavender House, was often seen walking with and talking to Miss\nForest.  Sometimes Annie shook her pretty head over Susan's remarks;\nsometimes she listened to her; sometimes she laughed and spoke eagerly\nfor a moment or two, and appeared to acquiesce in suggestions which her\ncompanion urged.\n\nAnnie had always been the soul of disorder--of wild pranks, of naughty\nand disobedient deeds--but, hitherto, in all her wildness she had never\nintentionally hurt any one but herself.  Hers was a giddy and\nthoughtless, but by no means a bitter tongue--she thought well of all\nher school-fellows--and on occasions she could be self-sacrificing and\ngood-natured to a remarkable extent.  The girls of the head class took\nvery little notice of Annie, but her other school-companions, as a rule,\nsuccumbed to her sunny, bright, and witty ways.  She offended them a\nhundred times a day, and a hundred times a day was forgiven.  Hester was\nthe first girl in the third-class who had ever persistently disliked\nAnnie and Annie, after making one or two overtures of friendship, began\nto return Miss Thornton's aversion; but she had never cordially hated\nher until the day they met in Cecil Temple's drawing-room and Hester had\nwounded Annie in her tenderest part by doubting her affection for Mrs\nWillis.\n\nSince that day there was a change very noticeable in Annie Forest--she\nwas not so gay as formerly, but she was a great deal more mischievous--\nshe was not nearly so daring, but she was capable now of little actions\nslight in themselves, which yet were calculated to cause mischief and\nreal unhappiness.  Her sudden friendship with Susan Drummond did her no\ngood, and she persistently avoided all intercourse with Cecil Temple,\nwho hitherto had influenced her in the right direction.\n\nThe incident of the green book had passed with no apparent result of\ngrave importance, but the spirit of mischief which had caused this book\nto be found was by no means asleep in the school.  Pranks were played in\na most mysterious fashion with the girls' properties.\n\nHester herself was the very next victim.  She too was a neat and orderly\nchild--she was clever and thoroughly enjoyed her school work.  She was\nannoyed, therefore, and dreadfully puzzled, by discovering one morning\nthat her neat French exercise-book was disgracefully blotted, and one\npage torn across.  She was severely reprimanded by Mdlle.  Perier for\nsuch gross untidiness and carelessness, and when she assured the\ngoverness that she knew nothing whatever of the circumstance, that she\nwas never guilty of blots, and had left the book in perfect order the\nnight before, the French lady only shrugged her shoulders, made an\nexpressive gesture with her eyebrows, and plainly showed Hester that she\nthought the less she said on that subject the better.\n\nHester was required to write out her exercise again, and she fancied she\nsaw a triumphant look in Annie Forest's eyes as she left the\nschool-room, where poor Hester was obliged to remain to undergo her\nunmerited punishment.\n\n\"Cecil,\" called Hester, in a passionate and eager voice, as Miss Temple\nwas passing her place.\n\nCecil paused for a moment.\n\n\"What is it, Hetty?--oh, I am so sorry you must stay in this lovely\nbright day.\"\n\n\"I have done nothing wrong,\" said Hester; \"I never blotted this\nexercise-book; I never tore this page.  It is most unjust not to believe\nmy word; it is most unjust to punish me for what I have not done.\"\n\nMiss Temple's face looked puzzled and sad.\n\n\"I must not stay to talk to you now, Hester,\" she whispered; \"I am\nbreaking the rules.  You can come to my drawing-room by-and-by, and we\nwill discuss this matter.\"\n\nBut Hester and Cecil, talk as they would, could find no solution to the\nmystery.  Cecil absolutely refused to believe that Annie Forest had\nanything to do with the matter.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"such deceit is not in Annie's nature.  I would do\nanything to help you, Hester; but I can't, and I won't, believe that\nAnnie tried deliberately to do you any harm.\"\n\n\"I am quite certain she did,\" retorted Hester, \"and from this moment I\nrefuse to speak to her until she confesses what she has done and\napologises to me.  Indeed, I have a great mind to go and tell everything\nto Mrs Willis.\"\n\n\"Oh, I would not do that,\" said Cecil; \"none of your school-fellows\nwould forgive you if you charged such a favourite as Annie with a crime\nwhich you cannot in the least prove against her.  You must be patient,\nHester, and if you are, I will take your part, and try to get at the\nbottom of the mystery.\"\n\nCecil, however, failed to do so.  Annie laughed when the affair was\ndiscussed in her presence, but her clear eyes looked as innocent as the\nday, and nothing would induce Cecil to doubt Miss Forest's honour.\n\nThe mischievous sprite, however, who was sowing such seeds of\nunhappiness in the hitherto peaceful school was not satisfied with two\ndeeds of daring; for a week afterwards Cecil Temple found a book of Mrs\nBrowning's, out of which she was learning a piece for recitation, with\nits cover half torn off, and, still worse, a caricature of Mrs Willis\nsketched with some cleverness and a great deal of malice on the\ntitle-page.  On the very same morning, Dora Russell, on opening her\ndesk, was seen to throw up her hands with a gesture of dismay.  The neat\ncomposition she had finished the night before was not to be seen in its\naccustomed place, but in a corner of the desk were two bulky and\nmysterious parcels, one of which contained a great junk of rich\nplum-cake, and the other some very sticky and messy \"Turkish delight;\"\nwhile the paper which enveloped these luxuries was found to be that on\nwhich the missing composition was written.  Dora's face grew very\nwhite--she forgot the ordinary rules of the school, and, leaving her\nclass, walked down the room, and interrupted Miss Good, who was\nbeginning to instruct the third-class in English grammar.\n\n\"Will you please come and see something in my desk, Miss Good?\" she said\nin a voice which trembled with excitement.\n\nIt was while she was speaking that Cecil found the copy of Mrs Browning\nmutilated, and with the disgraceful caricature on its title-page.\nStartled as she was by this discovery, and also by Miss Russell's\nextraordinary behaviour, she had presence of mind enough to hide the\nsight which pained her from her companions.  Unobserved, in the strong\ninterest of the moment, for all the girls were watching Dora Russell and\nMiss Good, she managed to squeeze the little volume into her pocket.\nShe had indeed received a great shock, for she knew well that the only\ngirl who could caricature in the school was Annie Forest.  For a moment\nher troubled eyes sought the ground, but then she raised them and looked\nat Annie.  Annie, however, with a particularly cheerful face, and her\nbright dark eyes full of merriment, was gazing in astonishment at the\nscene which was taking place in front of Miss Russell's desk.\n\nDora, whose enunciation was very clear, seemed to have absolutely\nforgotten herself; she disregarded Miss Good's admonitions, and declared\nstoutly that at such a moment she did not care what rules she broke.\nShe was quite determined that the culprit who had dared to desecrate her\ncomposition, and put plum-cake and \"Turkish delight\" into her desk,\nshould be publicly exposed and punished.\n\n\"The thing cannot go on any longer, Miss Good,\" she said; \"there is a\ngirl in this school who ought to be expelled from it, and I for one\ndeclare openly that I will not submit to associate with a girl who is\nworse than unladylike.  If you will permit me, Miss Good, I will carry\nthese things at once to Mrs Willis, and beg of her to investigate the\nwhole affair, and bring the culprit to justice, and to turn her out of\nthe school.\"\n\n\"Stay, Miss Russell,\" exclaimed the English teacher, \"you strangely and\ncompletely forget yourself.  You are provoked.  I own, but you have no\nright to stand up and absolutely hoist the flag of rebellion in the\nfaces of the other girls.  I cannot excuse your conduct.  I will myself\ntake away these parcels which were found in your desk, and will report\nthe affair to Mrs Willis.  She will take what steps she thinks right in\nbringing you to order, and in discovering the author of this mischief.\nReturn instantly to your desk, Miss Russell; you strangely forget\nyourself.\"\n\nMiss Good left the room, having removed the plum-cake and \"Turkish\ndelight\" from Dora Russell's desk, and lessons continued as best they\ncould under such exciting circumstances.\n\nAt twelve o'clock that day, just as the girls were preparing to go up to\ntheir rooms to get ready for their usual walk, Mrs Willis came into the\nschool-room.\n\n\"Stay one moment, young ladies,\" said the head-mistress in that slightly\nvibrating and authoritative voice of hers.  \"I have a word or two to say\nto you all.  Miss Good has just brought me a painful story of wanton and\ncruel mischief.  There are fifty girls in this school, who, until\nlately, lived happily together.  There is now one girl among the fifty\nwhose object it is to sow seeds of discord and misery among her\ncompanions.  Miss Good has told me of three different occasions on which\nmischief has been done to different girls in the school.  Twice Miss\nRussell's desk has been disturbed, once Miss Thornton's.  It is possible\nthat other girls may also have suffered who have been noble enough not\nto complain.  There is, however, a grave mischief, in short, a moral\ndisease in our midst.  Such a thing is worse than bodily illness--it\nmust be stamped out instantly and completely at the risk of any personal\nsuffering.  I am now going to ask you, girls, a simple question, and I\ndemand instant truth without any reservation.  Miss Russell's desk has\nbeen tampered with--Miss Thornton's desk has been tampered with.  Has\nany other girl suffered injury--has any other girl's desk been touched?\"\n\nMrs Willis looked down the long room--her voice had reached every\ncorner, and the quiet, dignified, and deeply-pained expression in her\nfine eyes was plainly visible to each girl in the school.  Even the\nlittle ones were startled and subdued by the tone of Mrs Willis's\nvoice, and one or two of them suddenly burst into tears.  Mrs Willis\npaused for a full moment, then she repeated her question.\n\n\"I insist upon knowing the exact truth, my dear children,\" she said\ngently but with great decision.\n\n\"My desk has also been tampered with,\" said Miss Temple in a low voice.\n\nEvery one started when Cecil spoke, and even Annie Forest glanced at her\nwith a half-frightened and curious expression.  Cecil's voice indeed was\nso low, so shaken with doubt and pain, that her companions scarcely\nrecognised it.\n\n\"Come here, Miss Temple,\" said Mrs Willis.\n\nCecil instantly left her desk and walked up the room.\n\n\"Your desk has also been tampered with, you say?\" repeated the\nhead-mistress.\n\n\"Yes, madam.\"\n\n\"When did you discover this?\"\n\n\"To-day, Mrs Willis.\"\n\n\"You kept it to yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you now repeat in the presence of the school, and in a loud enough\nvoice to be heard by all here, exactly what was done?\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" answered Cecil, and now her voice was a little less\nagitated and broken, and she looked full into the face of her teacher,\n\"I cannot do that.\"\n\n\"You deliberately disobey me, Cecil?\" said Mrs Willis.\n\n\"Yes, madam.\"\n\nMrs Willis's face flushed--she did not, however, look angry--she laid\nher hand on Cecil's shoulder and looked full into her eyes.\n\n\"You are one of my best pupils, Cecil,\" she said tenderly.  \"At such a\nmoment as this honour requires you to stand by your mistress.  I must\ninsist on your telling me here and now exactly what has occurred.\"\n\nCecil's face grew whiter and whiter.\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" she murmured; \"it breaks my heart, but I cannot\ntell you.\"\n\n\"You have defied me, Cecil,\" said Mrs Willis in a tone of deep pain.\n\"I must, my dear, insist on your obedience, but not now.  Miss Good,\nwill you take Miss Temple to the chapel?  I will come to you, Cecil, in\nan hour's time.\"\n\nCecil walked down the room crying silently.  Her deep distress and her\nvery firm refusal to disclose what she knew had made a great impression\non her school-fellows.  They all felt troubled and uneasy, and Annie\nForest's face was very pale.\n\n\"This thing, this wicked, mischievous thing has gone deeper than I\nfeared,\" said Mrs Willis, when Cecil had left the room.\n\n\"Only some very strong motive would make Cecil Temple behave as she is\nnow doing.  She is influenced by a mistaken idea of what is right; she\nwishes to shield the guilty person.  I may as well tell you all, young\nladies, that, dear as Cecil is to me, she is now under the ban of my\nsevere displeasure.  Until she confesses the truth and humbles herself\nbefore me, I cannot be reconciled to her.  I cannot permit her to\nassociate with you.  She has done very wrong, and her punishment must be\nproportionately severe.  There is one chance for her, however.  Will the\ngirl whom she is mistakenly, though generously, trying to shield, come\nforward and confess her guilt, and so release poor Cecil from the\nterrible position in which she has placed herself?  By doing so, the\ngirl who has caused all this misery will at least show me that she is\ntrying to repent.\"\n\nMrs Willis paused again, and now she looked down the room with a face\nof almost entreaty.  Several pairs of eyes were fixed anxiously on her,\nseveral looked away, and many girls glanced in the direction of Annie\nForest, who, feeling herself suspected, returned their glances with bold\ndefiance, and instantly assumed her most reckless manner.\n\nMrs Willis waited for a full minute.\n\n\"The culprit is not noble enough,\" she said then.  \"Now, girls, I must\nask each of you to come up one by one and deny or confess this charge.\nAs you do so, you are silently to leave the school-room and go up to\nyour rooms, and prepare for the walk which has been so painfully\ndelayed.  Miss Conway, you are at the head of the school, will you set\nthe example?\"\n\nOne by one the girls of the head class stepped up to their teacher, and\nof each one she asked the same question--\n\n\"Are you guilty?\"\n\nEach girl replied in the negative and walked out of the school-room.\nThe second-class followed the example of the first, and then the\nthird-class came up to their teacher.  Several ears were strained to\nhear Annie Forest's answer, but her eyes were lifted fearlessly to Mrs\nWillis's face, and her \"No!\" was heard all over the room.\n\nCHAPTER 12. IN THE CHAPEL.\n\nThe bright light from a full noontide sun was shining in coloured bars\nthrough the richly-painted windows of the little chapel when Mrs Willis\nsought Cecil Temple there.\n\nCecil's face was in many ways a remarkable one.  Her soft brown eyes\nwere generally filled with a steadfast and kindly ray.  Gentleness was\nher special prerogative, but there was nothing weak about her--hers was\nthe gentleness of a strong and pure and noble soul.  To know Cecil was\nto love her.  She was a motherless girl, and the only child of a most\nindulgent father.  Colonel Temple was now in India, and Cecil was to\nfinish her education under Mrs Willis's care, and then, if necessary,\nto join her father.\n\nMrs Willis had always taken a special interest in this girl.  She\nadmired her for her great moral worth.  Cecil was not particularly\nclever, but she was so studious, so painstaking, that she always kept a\nhigh place in class.  She was without doubt a religious girl, but there\nwas nothing of the prig about her.  She was not, however, ashamed of her\nreligion, and, if the fitting occasion arose, she was fearless in\nexpressing her opinion.\n\nMrs Willis used to call Cecil her \"little standard-bearer,\" and she\nrelied greatly on her influence over the third-class girls.  Mrs Willis\nconsidered the third-class, perhaps, the most important in the school.\nShe was often heard to say--\n\n\"The girls who fill this class have come to a turning-point--they have\ncome to the age when resolves may be made for life, and kept.  The good\nthird-class girl is very unlikely to degenerate as she passes through\nthe second and first classes.  On the other hand, there is very little\nhope that the idle or mischievous third-class girl will mend her ways as\nshe goes higher in the school.\"\n\nMrs Willis's steps were very slow, and her thoughts extremely painful,\nas she entered the chapel to-day.  Had any one else offered her defiance\nshe would have known how to deal with the culprit, but Cecil would never\nhave acted as she did without the strongest motive, and Mrs Willis felt\nmore sorrowful than angry as she sat down by the side of her favourite\npupil.\n\n\"I have kept you waiting longer than I intended, my dear,\" she said.  \"I\nwas unexpectedly interrupted, and I am sorry; but you have had more time\nto think, Cecil.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have thought,\" answered Cecil, in a very low tone.\n\n\"And, perhaps,\" continued her governess, \"in this quiet and beautiful\nand sacred place, my dear pupil has also prayed?\"\n\n\"I have prayed,\" said Cecil.\n\n\"Then you have been guided, Cecil,\" said Mrs Willis in a tone of\nrelief.  \"We do not come to God in our distress without being shown the\nright way.  Your doubts have been removed, Cecil; you can now speak\nfully to me; can you not, dear?\"\n\n\"I have asked God to tell me what is right,\" said Cecil.  \"I don't\npretend to know.  I am very much puzzled.  It seems to me that more good\nwould be done if I concealed what you asked me to confess in the\nschool-room.  My own feeling is that I ought not to tell you.  I know\nthis is great disobedience, and I am quite willing to receive any\npunishment you think right to give me.  Yes, I think I am quite willing\nto receive _any_ punishment.\"\n\nMrs Willis put her hand on Cecil's shoulder.\n\n\"Ordinary punishments are not likely to affect you, Cecil,\" she said;\n\"on you I have no idea of inflicting extra lessons, or depriving you of\nhalf-holidays, or even taking away your drawing-room.  But there is\nsomething else you must lose, and that I know will touch you deeply--I\nmust remove from you my confidence.\"\n\nCecil's face grew very pale.\n\n\"And your love, too?\" she said, looking up with imploring eyes: \"oh,\nsurely not your love as well?\"\n\n\"I ask you frankly, Cecil,\" replied Mrs Willis, \"can perfect love exist\nwithout perfect confidence?  I would not willingly deprive you of my\nlove, but of necessity the love I have hitherto felt for you must be\naltered--in short, the old love which enabled me to rest on you and\ntrust you, will cease.\"\n\nCecil covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"This punishment is very cruel,\" she said.  \"You are right; it reaches\ndown to my very heart.  But,\" she added, looking up with a strong and\nsweet light in her face, \"I will try and bear it, and some day you will\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Listen, Cecil,\" said Mrs Willis, \"you have just told me you have\nprayed to God, and have asked Him to show you the right path.  Now, my\ndear, suppose we kneel together, and both of us ask Him to show us the\nway out of this difficult matter.  I want to be guided to use the right\nwords with you, Cecil.  You want to be guided to receive the instruction\nwhich I, as your teacher and mother-friend, would give you.\"\n\nCecil and Mrs Willis both knelt down, and the head-mistress said a few\nwords in a voice of great earnestness and entreaty; then they resumed\ntheir seats.\n\n\"Now, Cecil,\" said Mrs Willis, \"you must remember in listening to me\nthat I am speaking to you as I believe God wishes me to.  If I can\nconvince you that you are doing wrong in concealing what you know from\nme, will you act as I wish in the matter?\"\n\n\"I long to be convinced,\" said Cecil, in a low tone.\n\n\"That is right, my dear; I can now speak to you with perfect freedom.\nMy words you will remember, Cecil, are now, I firmly believe, directed\nby God; they are also the result of a large experience.  I have trained\nmany girls.  I have watched the phases of thought in many young minds.\nCecil, look at me.  I can read you like a book.\"\n\nCecil looked up expectantly.\n\n\"Your motive for this concealment is as clear as the daylight, Cecil.\nYou are keeping back what you know because you want to shield some one.\nAm I not right, my dear?\"  The colour flooded Cecil's pale face.  She\nbent her head in silent assent, but her eyes were too full of tears, and\nher lips trembled too much to allow her to speak.\n\n\"The girl you want to defend,\" continued Mrs Willis, in that clear\npatient voice of hers, \"is one whom you and I both love; is one for whom\nwe both have prayed; is one for whom we would both gladly sacrifice\nourselves if necessary--her name is--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't,\" said Cecil imploringly--\"don't say her name; you have no\nright to suspect her.\"\n\n\"I must say her name, Cecil dear.  If you suspect Annie Forest, why\nshould not I?  You do suspect her, do you not, Cecil?\"\n\nCecil began to cry.\n\n\"I know it,\" continued Mrs Willis.  \"Now, Cecil, we will suppose,\nterrible as this suspicion is, fearfully as it pains us both, that Annie\nForest _is_ guilty.  We must suppose for the sake of my argument that\nthis is the case.  Do you not know, my dear Cecil, that you are doing\nthe falsest, cruellest thing by dear Annie in trying to hide her sin\nfrom me?  Suppose, just for the sake of our argument, that this cowardly\nconduct on Annie's part was never found out by me; what effect would it\nhave on Annie herself?\"\n\n\"It would save her in the eyes of the school,\" said Cecil.\n\n\"Just so, but God would know the truth.  Her next downfall would be\ndeeper.  In short, Cecil, under the idea of friendship you would have\ndone the cruellest thing in all the world for your friend.\"\n\nCecil was quite silent.\n\n\"This is one way to look at it,\" continued Mrs Willis, \"but there are\nmany other points from which this case ought to be viewed.  You owe much\nto Annie, but not all--you have a duty to perform to your other\nschool-fellows.  You have a duty to perform to me.  If you possess a\nclue which will enable me to convict Annie Forest of her sin, in common\njustice you have no right to withhold it.  Remember that while she goes\nabout free and unsuspected some other girl is under the ban--some other\ngirl is watched and feared.  You fail in your duty to your\nschool-fellows when you keep back your knowledge, Cecil.  When you\nrefuse to trust me, you fail in your duty to your mistress; for I cannot\nstamp out this evil and wicked thing from our midst unless I know all.\nWhen you conceal your knowledge, you ruin the character of the girl you\nseek to shield.  When you conceal your knowledge, you go against God's\nexpress wish.  There--I have spoken to you as He directed me to speak.\"\n\nCecil suddenly sprang to her feet.\n\n\"I never thought of all these things,\" she said.  \"You are right, but it\nis very hard, and mine is only a suspicion.  Oh, do be tender to her,\nand--forgive me--may I go away now?\"\n\nAs she spoke, she pulled out the torn copy of Mrs Browning, laid it on\nher teacher's lap, and ran swiftly out of the chapel.\n\nCHAPTER 13. TALKING OVER THE MYSTERY.\n\nAnnie Forest sitting in the midst of a group of eager admirers, was\nchatting volubly.  Never had she been in higher spirits, never had her\npretty face looked more bright and daring.\n\nCecil Temple, coming into the play-room, started when she saw her.\nAnnie, however, instantly rose from the low hassock on which she had\nperched herself and, running up to Cecil, put her hand through her arm.\n\n\"We are all discussing the mystery, darling,\" said she; \"we have\ndiscussed it, and literally torn it to shreds, and yet never got at the\nkernel.  We have guessed and guessed what your motive can be in\nconcealing the truth from Mrs Willis, and we all unanimously vote that\nyou are a dear old martyr, and that you have some admirable reason for\nkeeping back the truth.  You cannot think what an excitement we are in--\neven Susy Drummond has stayed awake to listen to our chatter.  Now,\nCecil, do come and sit here in this most inviting little armchair, and\ntell us what our dear head-mistress said to you in the chapel.  It did\nseem so awful to send you to the chapel, poor dear Cecil.\"\n\nCecil stood perfectly still and quiet while Annie was pouring out her\ntorrent of eager words; her eyes, indeed, did not quite meet her\ncompanion's, but she allowed Annie to retain her clasp of her arm, and\nshe evidently listened with attention to her words.  Now, however, when\nMiss Forest tried to draw her into the midst of the eager and animated\ngroup who sat round the play-room fire, she hesitated and looked\nlongingly in the direction of her peaceful little drawing-room.  Her\nhesitation, however, was but momentary.  Quite silently she walked with\nAnnie down the large play-room and entered the group of girls.\n\n\"Here's your throne, Queen Cecil,\" said Annie trying to push her into\nthe little armchair; but Cecil would not seat herself.\n\n\"How nice that you have come, Cecil!\" said Mary Pierce, a second-class\ngirl.  \"I really think, we all think, that you were very brave to stand\nout against Mrs Willis as you did.  Of course we are devoured with\ncuriosity to know what it means; aren't we, Flo?\"\n\n\"Yes, we're in agonies,\" answered Flo Dunstan, another second-class\ngirl.\n\n\"You will tell exactly what Mrs Willis said, darling heroine?\"\nproceeded Annie in her most dulcet tones.  \"You concealed your\nknowledge, didn't you? you were very firm, weren't you? dear, brave\nlove!\"\n\n\"For my part, I think Cecil Temple the soul of brave firmness,\" here\ninterrupted Susan Drummond.  \"I fancy she's as hard and firm in herself\nwhen she wants to conceal a thing as that rocky sweetmeat which always\nhurts our teeth to get through.  Yes, I do fancy that.\"\n\n\"Oh, Susy, what a horrid metaphor!\" here interrupted several girls.\n\nOne, however, of the eager group of school-girls had not opened her lips\nor said a word; that girl was Hester Thornton.  She had been drawn into\nthe circle by an intense curiosity; but she had made no comment with\nregard to Cecil's conduct.  If she knew anything of the mystery she had\nthrown no light on it.  She had simply sat motionless, with watchful and\nalert eyes and silent tongue.  Now, for the first time, she spoke.\n\n\"I think, if you will allow her, that Cecil has got something to say,\"\nshe remarked.\n\nCecil glanced down at her with a very brief look of gratitude.\n\n\"Thank you, Hester,\" she said.  \"I won't keep you a moment, girls.  I\ncannot offer to throw any light on the mystery which makes us all so\nmiserable to-day; but I think it right to undeceive you with regard to\nmyself.  I have not concealed what I know from Mrs Willis.  She is in\npossession of all the facts, and what I found in my desk this morning is\nnow in her keeping.  She has made me see that in concealing my knowledge\nI was acting wrongly, and whatever pain has come to me in the matter,\nshe now knows all.\"\n\nWhen Cecil had finished her sad little speech she walked straight out of\nthe group of girls, and, without glancing at one of them, went across\nthe play-room to her own compartment.  She had failed to observe a quick\nand startled glance from Susan Drummond's sleepy blue eyes, nor had she\nheard her mutter--half to her companions, half to herself--\"Cecil is not\nlike the rocky sweetmeat; I was mistaken in her.\"\n\nNeither had Cecil seen the flash of almost triumph in Hester's eyes, nor\nthe defiant glance she threw at Miss Forest.  Annie stood with her hands\nclasped, and a little frown of perplexity between her brows, for a\nmoment; then she ran fearlessly down the play-room, and said in a low\nvoice at the other side of Cecil's curtains--\n\n\"May I come in?\"\n\nCecil said \"Yes,\" and Annie, entering the pretty little drawing-room,\nflung her arms round Miss Temple's neck.\n\n\"Cecil,\" she exclaimed impulsively, \"you're in great trouble.  I am a\ngiddy, reckless thing, I know, but I don't laugh at people when they are\nin real trouble.  Won't you tell me all about it, Cecil?\"\n\n\"I will, Annie.  Sit down there and I will tell you everything.  I think\nyou have a right to know, and I am glad you have come to me.  I thought,\nperhaps--but no matter.  Annie, can't you guess what I am going to say?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I can't,\" said Annie.  \"I saw for a moment or two to-day\nthat some of those absurd girls suspected me of being the author of all\nthis mischief.  Now, you know, Cecil, I love a bit of fun beyond words.\nIf there's any going on I feel nearly mad until I am in it; but what was\ndone to-day was not at all in accordance with my ideas of fun.  To tear\nup Miss Russell's essay and fill her desk with stupid plum-cake and\nTurkish delight seems to me but a sorry kind of jest.  Now, if I had\nbeen guilty of that sort of thing, I'd have managed something far\ncleverer than that.  If _I_ had tampered with Dora Russell's desk, I'd\nhave done the thing in style.  The dear, sweet, dignified creature\nshould have shrieked in real terror.  You don't know perhaps, Cecil,\nthat our admirable Dora is no end of a coward.  I wonder what she would\nhave said if I had put a little nest of field-mice in her desk.  I saw\nthat the poor thing suspected me, as she gave way to her usual little\nsneer about the `underbred girl:' but, of course, _you_ know me, Cecil.\nWhy, my dear Cecil, what is the matter?  How white you are, and you are\nactually crying!  What is it, Cecil? what is it, Cecil, darling?\"\n\nCecil dried her eyes quickly.\n\n\"You know my pet copy of Mrs Browning's poems, don't you, Annie?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course.  You lent it to me one day.  Don't you remember how\nyou made me cry over that picture of little Alice, the over-worked\nfactory girl?  What about the book, Cecil?\"\n\n\"I found the book in my desk,\" said Cecil, in a steady tone, and now\nfixing her eyes on Annie, who knelt by her side--\"I found the book in my\ndesk, although I never keep it there; for it is quite against the rules\nto keep our recreation books in our school-desks, and you know, Annie, I\nalways think it is so much easier to keep these little rules.  They are\nmatters of duty and conscience after all.  I found my copy of Mrs\nBrowning in my desk this morning with the cover torn off, and with a\nvery painful and ludicrous caricature of our dear Mrs Willis sketched\non the title-page.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Annie.  \"No, no; impossible.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it do you, Annie?\"\n\n\"I never put it there, if that's what you mean,\" said Annie.  But her\nface had undergone a curious change.  Her light and easy and laughing\nmanner had altered.  When Cecil mentioned the caricature she flushed a\nvivid crimson.  Her flush had quickly died away, leaving her\nolive-tinted face paler than its wont.\n\n\"I see,\" she said, after a long pause, \"you, too, suspected me, Cecil,\nand that is why you tried to conceal the thing.  You know that I am the\nonly girl in the school who can draw caricatures, but did you suppose\nthat I would show _her_ dishonour?  Of course things look ugly for me,\nif this is what you found in your book; but I did not think that _you_\nwould suspect me, Cecil.\"\n\n\"I will believe you, Annie,\" said Cecil eagerly.  \"I long beyond words\nto believe you.  With all your faults, no one has ever yet found you out\nin a lie.  If you look at me, Annie, and tell me honestly that you know\nnothing whatever about that caricature, I will believe you.  Yes, I will\nbelieve you fully, and I will go with you to Mrs Willis and tell her\nthat, whoever did the wrong, you are innocent in this matter.  Say you\nknow nothing about it, dear, dear Annie, and take a load off my heart.\"\n\n\"I never put the caricature into your book, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you know nothing about it?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that; I never--never put it in your book.\"\n\n\"Oh, Annie, exclaimed poor Cecil, you are trying to deceive me.  Why\nwon't you be brave?  Oh, Annie, I never thought you would stoop to a\nlie!\"\n\n\"I'm telling no lie,\" answered Annie with sudden passion.  \"I do know\nsomething about the caricature, but I never put it into that book.\nThere! you doubt me, you have ceased to believe me, and I won't waste\nany more words on the matter.\"\n\nCHAPTER 14. \"SENT TO COVENTRY.\"\n\nThere were many girls in the school who remembered that dismal\nhalf-holiday--they remembered its forced mirth and its hidden anxiety;\nand as the hours flew by the suspicion that Annie Forest was the author\nof all the mischief grew and deepened.  A school is like a little world,\nand popular opinion is apt to change with great rapidity.  Annie was\nundoubtedly the favourite of the school; but favourites are certain to\nhave enemies, and there were several girls unworthy enough and mean\nenough to be jealous of poor Annie's popularity.  She was the kind of\ngirl whom only very small natures could really dislike.  Her popularity\narose from the simple fact that hers was a peculiarly joyous and\nunselfish nature.  She was a girl with scarcely any self-consciousness;\nthose she loved, she loved devotedly; she threw herself with a certain\nfeverish impetuosity into their lives, and made their interests her own.\nTo get into mischief and trouble for the sake of a friend was an\nevery-day occurrence with Annie.  She was not the least studious; she\nhad no one particular talent, unless it was an untrained and birdlike\nvoice; she was always more or less in hot water about her lessons,\nalways behindhand in her tasks, always leaving undone what she should\ndo, and doing what she should not do.  She was a contradictory, erratic\ncreature--jealous of no one, envious of no one--dearly loving a joke,\nand many times inflicting pain from sheer thoughtlessness, but always\nready to say she was sorry, always ready to make friends again.\n\nIt is strange that such a girl as Annie should have enemies, but she\nhad, and in the last few weeks the feeling of jealousy and envy which\nhad always been smouldering in some breasts took more active form.  Two\nreasons accounted for this: Hester's openly avowed and persistent\ndislike to Annie, and Miss Russell's declared conviction that she was\nunderbred and not a lady.\n\nMiss Russell was the only girl in the first-class who had hitherto given\nwild little Annie a thought.\n\nIn the first-class, to-day, Annie had to act the unpleasing part of the\nwicked little heroine.  Miss Russell was quite certain of Annie's guilt;\nshe and her companions condescended to discuss poor Annie and to pull\nall her little virtues to pieces, and to magnify her sins to an alarming\nextent.\n\nAfter two or three hours of judicious conversation, Dora Russell and\nmost of the other first-class girls decided that Annie ought to be\nexpelled, and unanimously resolved that they at least, would do what\nthey could to \"send her to Coventry.\"\n\nIn the lower part of the school Annie also had a few enemies, and these\ngirls, having carefully observed Hester's attitude toward her, now came\nup close to this dignified little lady, and asked her boldly to declare\nher opinion with regard to Annie's guilt.\n\nHester, without the least hesitation, assured them that \"of course Annie\nhad done it.\"\n\n\"There is not room for a single doubt on the subject,\" she said;\n\"there--look at her now.\"\n\nAt this instant Annie was leaving Cecil's compartment, and with red\neyes, and hair, as usual, falling about her face, was running out of the\nplay-room.  She seemed in great distress; but, nevertheless, before she\nreached the door, she stopped to pick up a little girl of five, who was\nfretting about some small annoyance.  Annie took the little one in her\narms, kissed her tenderly, whispered some words in her ear, which caused\nthe little face to light up with some smiles and the round arms to clasp\nAnnie with an ecstatic hug.  She dropped the child, who ran back to play\nmerrily with her companions, and left the room.\n\nThe group of middle-class girls still sat on by the fire, but Hester\nThornton now, not Annie, was the centre of attraction.  It was the first\ntime in all her young life that Hester had found herself in the enviable\nposition of a favourite; and without at all knowing what mischief she\nwas doing, she could not resist improving the occasion, and making the\nmost of her dislike for Annie.\n\nSeveral of those who even were fond of Miss Forest came round to the\nconviction that she was really guilty, and one by one, as is the fashion\nnot only among school-girls but in the greater world outside, they began\nto pick holes in their former favourite.  These girls, too, resolved\nthat, if Annie were really so mean as maliciously to injure other girls'\nproperty and get them into trouble, she must be \"sent to Coventry.\"\n\n\"What's Coventry?\" asked one of the little ones, the child whom Annie\nhad kissed and comforted, now sidling up to the group.\n\n\"Oh, a nasty place, Phena,\" said Mary Bell, putting her arm round the\npretty child and drawing her to her side.\n\n\"And who is going there?\"\n\n\"Why, I am afraid it is naughty Annie Forest.\"\n\n\"She's not naughty!  Annie sha'n't go to any nasty place.  I hate you,\nMary Bell.\"  The little one looked round the group with flashing eyes of\ndefiance, then wrenched herself away to return to her younger\ncompanions.\n\n\"It was stupid of you to say that, Mary,\" remarked one of the girls.\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"I suppose it is all settled, and poor Annie, to\nsay the least of it, is not a lady.  For my own part, I always thought\nher great fun, but if she is proved guilty of this offence I wash my\nhands of her.\"\n\n\"We all wash our hands of her,\" echoed the girls, with the exception of\nSusan Drummond, who, as usual, was nodding in her chair.\n\n\"What do you say, Susy?\" asked one or two--\"you have not opened your\nlips all this lime.\"\n\n\"I--eh?--what?\" asked Susan, stretching herself and yawning, \"oh, about\nAnnie Forest--I suppose you are right, girls.  Is not that the tea-gong?\nI'm awfully hungry.\"\n\nHester Thornton went into the tea-room that evening feeling particularly\nvirtuous, and with an idea that she had distinguished herself in some\nway.\n\nPoor foolish, thoughtless Hester, she little guessed what seed she had\nsown, and what a harvest she was preparing for her own reaping\nby-and-by.\n\nCHAPTER 15. ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT NO EVIL.\n\nA few days after this Hester was much delighted to receive an invitation\nfrom her little friends, the Misses Bruce.  These good ladies had not\nforgotten the lonely and miserable child whom they had comforted not a\nlittle during her journey to school six weeks ago.  They invited Hester\nto spend the next half-holiday with them, and as this happened to fall\non a Saturday, Mrs Willis gave Hester permission to remain with her\nfriends until eight o'clock, when she would send the carriage to fetch\nher home.\n\nThe trouble about Annie had taken place the Wednesday before, and all\nthe girls' heads were full of the uncleared-up mystery when Hester\nstarted on her little expedition.\n\nNothing was known; no fresh light had been thrown on the subject.\nEverything went on as usual within the school, and a casual observer\nwould never have noticed the cloud which rested over that usually happy\ndwelling.  A casual observer would have noticed little or no change in\nAnnie Forest; her merry laugh was still heard, her light step still\ndanced across the play-room floor, she was in her place in class, and\nwas, if anything, a little more attentive and a little more successful\nover her lessons.  Her pretty, piquant face, her arch expression, the\nbright, quick and droll glance which she alone could give, were still to\nbe seen; but those who knew her well and those who loved her best saw a\nchange in Annie.\n\nIn the play-room she devoted herself exclusively to the little ones; she\nnever went near Cecil Temple's drawing-room, she never mingled with the\ngirls of the middle school as they clustered round the cheerful fire.\nAt meal-times she ate little, and her room-fellow was heard to declare\nthat she was awakened more than once in the middle of the night by the\nsound of Annie's sobs.  In chapel, too, when she fancied herself quite\nunobserved, her face wore an expression of great pain; but if Mrs\nWillis happened to glance in her direction, instantly the little mouth\nbecame demure and almost hard, the dark eyelashes were lowered over the\nbright eyes, the whole expression of the face showed the extreme of\nindifference.  Hester felt more sure than ever of Annie's guilt; but one\nor two of the other girls in the school wavered in this opinion, and\nwould have taken Annie out of \"Coventry\" had she herself made the\nsmallest advance toward them.\n\nAnnie and Hester had not spoken to each other now for several days; but\non this afternoon, which was a bright one in early spring, as Hester was\nchanging her school-dress for her Sunday one, and preparing for her\nvisit to the Misses Bruce, there came a light knock at her door.  She\nsaid \"Come in,\" rather impatiently, for she was in a hurry, and dreaded\nbeing kept.\n\nTo her surprise Annie Forest put in her curly head, and then, dancing\nwith her usual light movement across the room, she laid a little bunch\nof dainty spring flowers on the dressing-table beside Hester.\n\nHester stared, first at the intruder and then at the early primroses.\nShe passionately loved flowers, and would have exclaimed with ecstasy at\nthese had anyone brought them in except Annie.\n\n\"I want you,\" said Annie, rather timidly for her, \"to take these flowers\nfrom me to Miss Agnes and Miss Jane Bruce.  It will be very kind of you\nif you will take them.  I am sorry to have interrupted you--thank you\nvery much.\"\n\nShe was turning away when Hester compelled herself to remark--\n\n\"Is there any message with the flowers?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--only Annie Forest's love.  They'll understand.\"  She turned\nhalf round as she spoke, and Hester saw that her eyes had filled with\ntears.  She felt touched in spite of herself.  There was something in\nAnnie's face now which reminded her of her darling little Nan at home.\nShe had seen the same beseeching, sorrowful look in Nan's brown eyes\nwhen she had wanted her friends to kiss her and take her to their hearts\nand love her.\n\nHester would not allow herself, however, to feel any tenderness toward\nAnnie.  Of course she was not really a bit like sweet little Nan, and it\nwas absurd to suppose that a great girl like Annie could want caressing\nand petting and soothing; still, in spite of herself, Annie's look\nhaunted her, and she took great care of the little flower-offering, and\npresented it with Annie's message instantly on her arrival to the little\nold ladies.\n\nMiss Jane and Miss Agnes were very much pleased with the early\nprimroses.  They looked at one another and said--\n\n\"Poor dear little girl,\" in tender voices, and then they put the flowers\ninto one of their daintiest vases, and made much of them, and showed\nthem to any visitors who happened to call that afternoon.\n\nTheir little house looked something like a doll's house to Hester, who\nhad been accustomed all her life to large rooms and spacious passages;\nbut it was the sweetest, daintiest, and most charming little abode in\nthe world.  It was not unlike a nest, and the Misses Bruce in certain\nways resembled bright little robin redbreasts, so small, so neat, so\nchirrupy they were.\n\nHester enjoyed her afternoon immensely; the little ladies were right in\ntheir prophecy, and she was no longer lonely at school.  She enjoyed\ntalking about her school-fellows, about her new life, about her studies.\nThe Misses Bruce were decidedly fond of a gossip, but something which\nshe could not at all define in their manner prevented Hester from\nretailing for their benefit any unkind news.  They told her frankly at\nlast that they were only interested in the good things which went on in\nthe school, and that they found no pursuit so altogether delightful as\nfinding out the best points in all the people they came across.  They\nwould not even laugh at sleepy, tiresome Susan Drummond; on the\ncontrary, they pitied her, and Miss Jane wondered if the girl could be\nquite well, whereupon Miss Agnes shook her head, and said emphatically\nthat it was Hester's duty to rouse poor Susy, and to make her waking\nlife so interesting to her that she should no longer care to spend so\nmany hours in the world of dreams.\n\nThere is such a thing as being so kind-hearted, so gentle, so charitable\nas to make the people who have not encouraged these virtues feel quite\nuncomfortable.  By the mere force of contrast they begin to see\nthemselves something as they really are.  Since Hester had come to\nLavender House she had taken very little pains to please others rather\nthan herself, and she was now almost startled to see how she had allowed\nselfishness to get the better of her.  While the Misses Bruce were\nspeaking, old longings, which had slept since her mother's death, came\nback to the young girl, and she began to wish that she could be kinder\nto Susan Drummond, and that she could overcome her dislike to Annie\nForest.  She longed to say something about Annie to the little ladies,\nbut they evidently did not wish to allude to the subject.  When she was\ngoing away, they gave her a small parcel.\n\n\"You will kindly give this to your schoolfellow, Miss Forest, Hester\ndear,\" they both said, and then they kissed her, and said they hoped\nthey should see her again: and Hester got into the old-fashioned school\nbrougham, and held the brown-paper parcel in her hand.\n\nAs she was going into the chapel that night, Mary Bell came up to her\nand whispered--\n\n\"We have not got to the bottom of that mystery about Annie Forest yet.\nMrs Willis can evidently make nothing of her, and I believe Mr Everard\nis going to talk to her after prayers to-night.\"\n\nAs she was speaking, Annie herself pushed rather rudely past the two\ngirls; her face was flushed, and her hair was even more untidy than was\nits wont.\n\n\"Here is a parcel for you, Miss Forest,\" said Hester, in a much more\ngentle tone than she was wont to use when she addressed this\nobjectionable school-mate.\n\nAll the girls were now filing into the chapel, and Hester should\ncertainly not have presented the little parcel at that moment.\n\n\"Breaking the rules, Miss Thornton,\" said Annie; \"all right, toss it\nhere.\"  Then, as Hester failed to comply, she ran back, knocking her\nschool-fellows out of place, and, snatching the parcel from Hester's\nhand, threw it high in the air.  This was a piece of not only wilful\naudacity and disobedience, but it even savoured of the profane, for\nAnnie's step was on the threshold of the chapel, and the parcel fell\nwith a noisy bang on the floor some feet inside the little building.\n\n\"Bring me that parcel, Annie Forest,\" whispered the stern voice of the\nhead-mistress.\n\nAnnie sullenly complied; but when she came up to Mrs Willis, her\ngoverness took her hand, and pushed her down into a low seat a little\nbehind her.\n\nCHAPTER 16. \"AN ENEMY HATH DONE THIS.\"\n\nThe short evening service was over, and one by one, in orderly\nprocession, the girls left the chapel.  Annie was about to rise to her\nfeet to follow her school-companions, when Mrs Willis stooped down and\nwhispered something in her ear.  Her face became instantly suffused with\na dull red; she resumed her seat, and buried her face in both her hands.\nOne or two of the girls noticed her despondent attitude as they left\nthe chapel, and Cecil Temple looked back with a glance of such\nunutterable sympathy that Annie's proud, suffering little heart would\nhave been touched could she but have seen the look.\n\nPresently the young steps died away, and Annie, raising her head, saw\nthat she was alone with Mr Everard, who seated himself in the place\nwhich Mrs Willis had occupied by her side.\n\n\"Your governess has asked me to speak to you, my dear,\" he said, in his\nkind and fatherly tones; \"she wants us to discuss this thing which is\nmaking you so unhappy quite fully together.\"  Here the clergyman paused,\nand, noticing a sudden wistful and soft look in the girl's brown eyes,\nhe continued: \"Perhaps, however, you have something to say to me which\nwill throw light on this mystery?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I have nothing to say,\" replied Annie, and now again the\nsullen expression passed like a wave over her face.\n\n\"Poor child,\" said Mr Everard.  \"Perhaps, Annie,\" he continued, \"you do\nnot quite understand me--you do not quite read my motive in talking to\nyou to-night.  I am not here in any sense to reprove you.  You are\neither guilty of this sin, or you are not guilty.  In either case I pity\nyou; it is very hard, very bitter, to be falsely accused--I pity you\nmuch if this is the case; but it is still harder, Annie, still more\nbitter, still more absolutely crushing to be accused of a sin which we\nare trying to conceal.  In that terrible case God Himself hides His\nface.  Poor child, poor child, I pity you most of all if you are\nguilty.\"\n\nAnnie had again covered her face, and bowed her head over her hands.\nShe did not speak for a moment, but presently Mr Everard heard a low\nsob, and then another, and another, until at last her whole frame was\nshaken with a perfect tempest of weeping.\n\nThe old clergyman, who had seen many strange phases of human nature, who\nhad in his day comforted and guided more than one young school-girl, was\nfar too wise to do anything to check this flow of grief.  He knew Annie\nwould speak more fully and more frankly when her tears were over.  He\nwas right.  She presently raised a very tear-stained face to the\nclergyman.\n\n\"I felt very bitter at your coming to speak to me,\" she began.  \"Mrs\nWillis has always sent for you when everything else has failed with us\ngirls, and I did not think she would treat me so.  I was determined not\nto say anything to you.  Now, however, you have spoken good words to me,\nand I can't turn away from you.  I will tell you all that is in my\nheart.  I will promise before God to conceal nothing, if only you will\ndo one thing for me.\"\n\n\"What is that, my child?\"\n\n\"Will you believe me?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you have not been tried yet.  I thought Mrs Willis would\ncertainly believe; but she said the circumstantial evidence was too\nstrong--perhaps it will be too strong for you.\"\n\n\"I promise to believe you, Annie Forest; if, before God, you can assure\nme that you are speaking the whole truth, I will fully believe you.\"\n\nAnnie paused again, then she rose from her seat and stood a pace away\nfrom the old minister.\n\n\"This is the truth before God,\" she said, as she locked her two hands\ntogether and raised her eyes freely and unshrinkingly to Mr Everard's\nface.\n\n\"I have always loved Mrs Willis.  I have reasons for loving her which\nthe girls don't know about.  The girls don't know that when my mother\nwas dying she gave me into Mrs Willis's charge, and she said, `You must\nkeep Annie until her father comes back.'  Mother did not know where\nfather was; but she said he would be sure to come back some day, and\nlook for mother and me: and Mrs Willis said she would keep me\nfaithfully until father came to claim me.  That is four years ago, and\nmy father has never come, nor have I heard of him, and I think, I am\nalmost sure, that the little money which mother left must be all used\nup.  Mrs Willis never says anything about money, and she did not wish\nme to tell my story to the girls.  None of them know except Cecil\nTemple.  I am sure some day father will come home, and he will give Mrs\nWillis back the money she has spent on me; but never, never, never can\nhe repay her for her goodness to me.  You see I cannot help loving Mrs\nWillis.  It is quite impossible for any girl to have such a friend and\nnot to love her.  I know I am very wild, and that I do all sorts of mad\nthings.  It seems to me that I cannot help myself sometimes: but I would\nnot willingly, indeed, I would not willingly hurt anybody.  Last\nWednesday, as you know, there was a great disturbance in the school.\nDora Russell's desk was tampered with, and so was Cecil Temple's.  You\nknow, of course, what was found in both the desks.  Mrs Willis sent for\nme, and asked me about the caricature which was drawn in Cecil's book.\nI looked at it and I told her the truth.  I did not conceal one thing.\nI told her the whole truth as far as I knew it.  She did not believe me.\nShe said so.  What more could I do then?\"\n\nHere Annie paused, she began to unclasp and clasp her hands, and she\nlooked full at Mr Everard with a most pleading expression.\n\n\"Do you mind repeating to me exactly what you said to your governess?\"\nhe questioned.\n\n\"I said this, sir.  I said, `Yes, Mrs Willis, I did draw that\ncaricature.  You will scarcely understand how I, who love you so much,\ncould have been so mad and ungrateful as to do anything to turn you into\nridicule.  I would cut off my right hand now not to have done it; but I\ndid do it, and I must tell you the truth.'  `Tell me, dear,' she said,\nquite gently then.  `It was one wet afternoon about a fortnight ago,' I\nsaid to her; `a lot of us middle-school-girls were sitting together, and\nI had a pencil and some bits of paper, and I was making up funny little\ngroups of a lot of us, and the girls were screaming with laughter, for\nsomehow I managed to make the likeness that I wanted in each case.'  It\nwas very wrong of me, I know.  It was against the rules; but I was in\none of my maddest humours, and I really do not care what the\nconsequences were.  At last one of the girls said: `You won't dare to\nmake a picture like that of Mrs Willis, Annie--you know you won't\ndare.'  The minute she said that name I began to feel ashamed.  I\nremembered I was breaking one of the rules, and I suddenly tore up all\nmy bits of paper and flung them into the fire, and I said, `No, I would\nnot dare to show her dishonour.'  Well, afterwards, as I was washing my\nhands for tea up in my room, the temptation came over me so strongly\nthat I felt I could not resist it, to make a funny little sketch of Mrs\nWillis.  I had a little scrap of thin paper, and I took out my pencil\nand did it all in a minute.  It seemed to me very funny, and I could not\nhelp laughing at it; and then I thrust it into my private writing-case,\nwhich I always keep locked, and I put the key in my pocket and ran\ndownstairs.  I forgot all about the caricature.  I had never shown it to\nanyone.  How it got into Cecil's book is more than I can say.  When I\nhad finished speaking Mrs Willis looked very hard at the book.  `You\nare right,' she said; `this caricature is drawn on a very thin piece of\npaper, which has been cleverly pasted on the title-page.'  Then, Mr\nEverard, she asked me a lot of questions.  Had I ever parted with my\nkeys?  Had I ever left my desk unlocked?  `No,' I said, `my desk is\nalways locked, and my keys are always in my pocket.  Indeed,' I added,\n`my keys were absolutely safe for the last week, for they went in a\nwhite petticoat to the wash, and came back as rusty as possible.'  I\ncould not open my desk for a whole week, which was a great nuisance.  I\ntold all this story to Mrs Willis, and she said to me, `You are\npositively certain that this caricature has been taken out of your desk\nby somebody else, and pasted in here?  You are sure that the caricature\nyou drew is not to be found in your desk?'  `Yes,' I said; `how can I be\nanything but sure; these are my pencil marks, and that is the funny\nlittle turn I gave to your neck which made me laugh when I drew it.\nYes; I am certainly sure.'\n\n\"`I have always been told, Annie,' Mrs Willis said, `that you are the\nonly girl in the school who can draw these caricatures.  You have never\nseen an attempt at this kind of drawing amongst your school-fellows, or\namongst any of the teachers?'\n\n\"`I have never seen any of them try this special kind of drawing,' I\nsaid.  `I wish I was like them.  I wish I had never, never done it.'\n\n\"`You have got your keys now?'  Mrs Willis said.\n\n\"`Yes,' I answered, pulling them all covered with rust out of my pocket.\n\n\"Then she told me to leave the keys on the table, and to go upstairs and\nfetch down my little private desk.\n\n\"I did so, and she made me put the rusty key in the lock and open the\ndesk, and together we searched through its contents.  We pulled out\neverything, or rather I did, and I scattered all my possessions about on\nthe table, and then I looked up almost triumphantly at Mrs Willis.\n\n\"`You see the caricature is not here,' I said, `somebody picked the lock\nand took it away.'\n\n\"`This lock has not been picked,' Mrs Willis said, `and what is that\nlittle piece of white paper sticking out of the private drawer?'\n\n\"`Oh, I forgot my private drawer,' I said; `but there is nothing in it--\nnothing whatever,' and then I touched the spring, and pulled it open,\nand there lay the little caricature which I had drawn in the bottom of\nthe drawer.  There it lay, not as I had left it, for I had never put it\ninto the private drawer.  I saw Mrs Willis's face turn very white, and\nI noticed that her hands trembled.  I was all red myself, and very hot,\nand there was a choking lump in my throat, and I could not have got a\nsingle word out even if I had wished to.  So I began scrambling the\nthings back into my desk, as hard as ever I could, and then I locked it,\nand put the rusty keys back in my pocket.\n\n\"`What am I to believe now, Annie?'  Mrs Willis said.\n\n\"`Believe anything you like now,' I managed to say; and then I took my\ndesk and walked out of the room, and would not wait even though she\ncalled me back.\n\n\"That is the whole story, Mr Everard,\" continued Annie.  \"I have no\nexplanation whatever to give.  I did make the one caricature of my dear\ngoverness.  I did not make the other.  The second caricature is\ncertainly a copy of the first, but I did not make it.  I don't know who\nmade it.  I have no light whatever to throw on the subject.  You see\nafter all,\" added Annie Forest, raising her eyes to the clergyman's\nface, \"it is impossible for you to believe me.  Mrs Willis does not\nbelieve me, and you cannot be expected to.  I don't suppose you are to\nbe blamed.  I don't see how you can help yourself.\"\n\n\"The circumstantial evidence is very strong against you, Annie,\" replied\nthe clergyman; \"still, I promised to believe, and I have no intention of\ngoing back from my word.  If, in the presence of God in this little\nchurch you would willingly and deliberately tell me a lie I should never\ntrust human being again.  No, Annie Forest, you have many faults, but\nyou are not a liar.  I see the impress of truth on your brow, in your\neyes, on your lips.  This is a very gainful mystery, my child; but I\nbelieve you.  I am going to see Mrs Willis now.  God bless you, Annie.\nBe brave, be courageous, don't foster malice in your heart to any\nunknown enemy.  An enemy has truly done this thing, poor child; but God\nHimself will bring this mystery to light.  Trust Him, my dear; and now I\nam going to see Mrs Willis.\"\n\nWhile Mr Everard was speaking, Annie's whole expressive face had\nchanged; the sullen look had left it; the eyes were bright with renewed\nhope; the lips had parted in smiles.  There was a struggle for speech,\nbut no words came; the young girl stooped down and raised the old\nclergyman's withered hands to her lips.\n\n\"Let me stay here a little longer,\" she managed to say at last; and then\nhe left her.\n\nCHAPTER 17. \"THE SWEETS ARE POISONED.\"\n\n\"I think, my dear madam,\" said Mr Everard to Mrs Willis, \"that you\nmust believe your pupil.  She has not refused to confess to you from any\nstubbornness, but from, the simple reason that she has nothing to\nconfess.  I am firmly convinced that things are as she stated them, Mrs\nWillis.  There is a mystery here which we neither of us can explain, but\nwhich we must unravel.\"\n\nThen Mrs Willis and the clergyman had a long and anxious talk together.\nIt lasted for a long time, and some of its results at least were\nmanifest the next morning, for, just before the morning's work began,\nMrs Willis came to the large school-room, and, calling Annie Forest to\nher side, laid her hand on the young girl's shoulder.\n\n\"I wish to tell you all, young ladies,\" she said, \"that I completely and\nabsolutely exonerate Annie Forest from having any part in the\ndisgraceful occurrence which took place in this school-room a short time\nago.  I allude, of course, as you all know, to the book which was found\ntampered with in Cecil Temple's desk.  Some one else in this room is\nguilty, and the mystery has still to be unravelled, and the guilty girl\nhas still to come forward and declare herself.  If she is willing at\nthis moment to come to me here, and fully and freely confess her sin, I\nwill quite forgive her.\"\n\nThe head-mistress paused, and, still with her hand on Annie's shoulder,\nlooked anxiously down the long room.  The love and forgiveness which she\nfelt shone in her eyes at this moment.  No girl need have feared aught\nbut tenderness from her just then.\n\nNo one stirred; the moment passed, and a look of sternness returned to\nthe mistress's fine face.\n\n\"No,\" she said, in her emphatic and clear tones, \"the guilty girl\nprefers waiting until God discovers her sin for her.  My dear, whoever\nyou are, that hour is coming, and you cannot escape from it.  In the\nmeantime, girls, I wish you all to receive Annie Forest as quite\ninnocent.  I believe in her, so does Mr Everard, and so must you.\nAnyone who treats Miss Forest except as a perfectly innocent and\ntruthful girl incurs my severe displeasure.  My dear, you may return to\nyour seat.\"\n\nAnnie, whose face was partly hidden by her curly hair during the greater\npart of this speech, now tossed it back, and raised her brown eyes with\na look of adoration in them to her teacher.  Mrs Willis's face,\nhowever, still looked harassed.  Her eyes met Annie's, but no\ncorresponding glow was kindled in them; their glance was just, calm, but\ncold.\n\nThe childish heart was conscious of a keen pang of agony, and Annie went\nback to her lessons without any sense of exultation.\n\nThe fact was this: Mrs Willis's judgment and reason had been brought\nround by Mr Everard's words, but in her heart of hearts, almost unknown\nto herself, there still lingered a doubt of the innocence of her wayward\nand pretty pupil.  She said over and over to herself that she really now\nquite believed in Annie Forest, but then would come those whisperings\nfrom her pained and sore heart.\n\n\"Why did she ever make a caricature of one who has been as a mother to\nher?  If she made one caricature, could she not make another?  Above all\nthings, if _she_ did not do it, who did?\"\n\nMrs Willis turned away from these unpleasant whispers--she would not\nlet them stay with her, and turned a deaf ear to their ugly words.  She\nhad publicly declared in the school her belief in Annie's absolute\ninnocence, but at the moment when her pupil looked up at her with a\nworld of love and adoration in her gaze, she found to her own infinite\ndistress that she could not give her the old love.\n\nAnnie went back to her companions, and bent her head over her lessons,\nand tried to believe that she was very thankful and very happy, and\nCecil Temple managed to whisper a gentle word of congratulation to her,\nand at the twelve o'clock walk Annie perceived that a few of her\nschool-fellows looked at her with friendly eyes again.  She perceived\nnow that when she went into the play-room she was not absolutely\ntabooed, and that, if she chose, she might speedily resume her old reign\nof popularity.  Annie had, to a remarkable extent, the gift of inspiring\nlove, and her old favourites would quickly have flocked back to their\nsovereign had she so willed it.  It is certainly true that the girls to\nwhom the whole story was known in all its bearings found it difficult to\nunderstand how Annie could be innocent; but Mr Everard's and Mrs\nWillis's assertions were too potent to be disregarded, and most of the\ngirls were only too willing to let the whole affair slide from their\nminds, and to take back their favourite Annie to their hearts again.\n\nAnnie, however, herself did not so will it.  In the play-room she\nfraternised with the little ones who were alike her friends in adversity\nand sunshine; she rejected the overtures of her old favourites, but\nplayed, and romped, and was merry with the children of the sixth class.\nShe even declined Cecil's invitation to come and sit with her in her\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, \"I hate being still; I am in no humour for a talk.\nAnother time, Cecil, another time.  Now then, Sybil, my beauty, get well\non my back, and I'll be the willing dog carrying you round and round the\nroom.\"\n\nAnnie's face had not a trace of care or anxiety on it, but her eyes\nwould not quite meet Cecil's, and Cecil sighed as she turned away, and\nher heart, too, began to whisper little, mocking, ugly doubts of poor\nAnnie.\n\nDuring the half-hour before tea that evening Annie was sitting on the\nfloor with a small child in her lap, and two other little ones tumbling\nabout her, when she was startled by a shower of lollipops being poured\nover her head, down her neck, and into her lap.  She started up and met\nthe sleepy gaze of Susan Drummond.\n\n\"That's to congratulate you, Miss,\" said Susan; \"you're a very lucky\ngirl to have escaped as you did.\"\n\nThe little ones began putting Susan's lollipops vigorously into their\nmouths.  Annie sprang to her feet, shaking the sticky sweetmeats out of\nher dress on to the floor.\n\n\"What have I escaped from?\" she asked, turning round and facing her\ncompanion haughtily.\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said Susan, stepping back a pace or two.  \"I--ah--\"\nstifling a yawn--\"I only meant you were very near getting into an ugly\nscrape.  It's no affair of mine, I'm sure; only I thought you'd like the\nlollipops.\"\n\n\"No, I don't like them at all,\" said Annie, \"nor you either.  Go back to\nyour own companions, please.\"\n\nSusan sulkily walked away, and Annie stooped down on the floor.\n\n\"Now, little darlings,\" she said, \"you mustn't eat those.  No, no, they\nare not good at all; and they have come from one of Annie's enemies.\nMost likely they are full of poison.  Let us collect them all, every\none, and we will throw them into the fire before we go to tea.\"\n\n\"But I don't think there's any poison in them,\" said little Janie West\nin a regretful tone, as she gobbled down a particularly luscious\nchocolate cream; \"they are all big, and fat, and bursty, and _so_ sweet,\nAnnie, dear.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Janie, they are dangerous sweeties all the same.  Come,\ncome, throw them into my apron, and I will run over and toss them into\nthe fire, and we'll have time for a game of leap-frog before tea; oh,\nfie, Judy,\" as a very small fat baby began to whimper, \"you would not\neat the sweeties of one of Annie's enemies.\"\n\nThis last appeal was successful.  The children made a valiant effort,\nand dashed the tempting goodies into Annie's alpaca apron.  When they\nwere all collected, she marched up the play-room and in the presence of\nSusan Drummond, Hester Thornton, Cecil Temple, and several more of her\nschool-companions, threw them into the fire.\n\n\"So much for _that_ overture, Miss Drummond,\" she said, making a mock\ncurtsey, and returning once more to the children.\n\nCHAPTER 18. IN THE HAMMOCK.\n\nJust at this time the weather suddenly changed.  After the cold and\ndreariness of winter came soft spring days--came longer evenings and\nbrighter mornings.\n\nHester Thornton found that, she could dress by daylight, then that she\nwas no longer cold and shivering when she reached the chapel, then that\nshe began intensely to enjoy her mid-day walk, then that she found her\nwinter things a little too hot, until at last, almost suddenly it seemed\nto the expectant and anxious girls, glorious spring weather broke upon\nthe world, the winds were soft and westerly, the buds swelled and\nswelled into leaf on the trees, and the flowers bloomed in the\ndelightful old-fashioned gardens of Lavender House.  Instantly, it\nseemed to the girls, their whole lives had altered.  The play-room was\ndeserted or only put up with on wet days.  At twelve o'clock, instead of\ntaking a monotonous walk on the roads, they ran races, played tennis,\ncroquet, or any other game they liked best in the gardens.  Later on in\nthe day, when the sun was not so powerful, they took their walk; but\neven then they had time to rush back to their beloved shady garden for a\nlittle time before tea and preparation for their next day's work.\nEaster came this year about the middle of April, and Easter found these\ngirls almost enjoying summer weather.  How they looked forward to their\nfew Easter holidays! what plans they made, what tennis matches were\narranged, what games and amusements of all sorts were in anticipation!\nMrs Willis herself generally went away for a few days at Easter; so did\nthe French governess, and the school was nominally placed under the\ncharge of Miss Good and Miss Danesbury.  Mrs Willis did not approve of\nlong Easter holidays; she never gave more than a week, and in\nconsequence only the girls who lived quite near went home.  Out of the\nfifty girls who resided at Lavender House about ten went away at Easter;\nthe remaining forty stayed behind, and were often heard to declare that\nholidays at Lavender House were the most delightful things in the world.\n\nAt this particular Easter time the girls were rather surprised to near\nthat Mrs Willis had made up her mind not to go away as usual; Miss Good\nwas to have a holiday, and Mrs Willis and Miss Danesbury were to look\nafter the school.  This was felt to be an unusual, indeed unheard-of,\nproceeding, and the girls commented about it a good deal, and somehow,\nwithout absolutely intending to do so, they began to settle in their own\nminds that Mrs Willis was staying in the school on account of Annie\nForest, and that in her heart of hearts she did not absolutely believe\nin her innocence.  Mrs Willis certainly gave the girls no reason to\ncome to this conclusion; she was consistently kind to Annie, and had\napparently quite restored her to her old place in her favour.  Annie was\nmore gentle than of old, and less inclined to get into scrapes; but the\ngirls loved her far less in her present unnatural condition of reserve\nand good behaviour than they did in her old daring and hoydenish days.\nCecil Temple always spent Easter with an old aunt who lived in a\nneighbouring town; she openly said this year that she did not wish to go\naway, but her governess would not allow her to change her usual plans,\nand she left Lavender House with a curious feeling of depression and\ncoming trouble.  As she was getting into the cab which was to take her\nto the station Annie flew to her side, threw a great bouquet of flowers\nwhich she had gathered into her lap, and, flinging her arms tightly\nround her neck, whispered suddenly and passionately:\n\n\"Oh, Cecil, believe in me.\"\n\n\"I--I--I don't know that I don't,\" said Cecil, rather lamely.\n\n\"No, Cecil, you don't--not in your heart of hearts.  Neither you nor\nMrs Willis--you neither of you believe in me from the very bottom of\nyour hearts; oh, it is hard!\"\n\nAnnie gave vent to a little sob, sprang away from Cecil's arms, and\ndisappeared into a shrubbery close by.\n\nShe stayed there until the sound of the retreating cab died away in the\navenue, then, tossing back her hair, rearranging her rather tattered\ngarden hat, and hastily wiping some tears from her eyes, she came out\nfrom her retreat, and began to look around her for some amusement.  What\nshould she do?  Where should she go?  How should she occupy herself?\nSounds of laughter and merriment filled the air; the garden was all\nalive with gay young figures running here and there.  Girls stood in\ngroups under the horse chestnut tree--girls walked two and two up the\nshady walk at the end of the garden--little ones gambolled and rolled on\nthe grass--a tennis match was going on vigorously, and the croquet\nground was occupied by eight girls of the middle school.  Annie was one\nof the most successful tennis players in the school; she had indeed a\ngift for all games of skill, and seldom missed her mark.  Now she looked\nwith a certain wistful longing toward the tennis-court; but, after a\nbrief hesitation, she turned away from it and entered the shady walk at\nthe farther end of the garden.  As she walked along, slowly,\nmeditatively, and sadly, her eyes suddenly lighted up.  Glancing to one\nof the tall trees she saw a hammock suspended there which had evidently\nbeen forgotten during the winter.  The tree was not yet quite in leaf,\nand it was very easy for Annie to climb up its branches, to readjust the\nhammock, and to get into it.  After its winter residence in the tree\nthis soft couch was found full of withered leaves, and otherwise rather\ndamp and uncomfortable.  Annie tossed the leaves on to the ground, and\nlaughed as she swung herself gently backwards and forwards.  Early as\nthe season still was the sun was so bright and the air so soft that she\ncould not but enjoy herself, and she laughed with pleasure, and only\nwished that she had a fairy tale by her side to help to soothe her off\nto sleep.\n\nIn the distance she heard some children calling \"Annie,\" \"Annie Forest;\"\nbut she was far too comfortable and too lazy to answer them, and\npresently she closed her eyes and really did fall asleep.\n\nShe was awakened by a very slight sound--by nothing more nor less than\nthe gentle and very refined conversation of two girls, who sat under the\noak-tree in which Annie's hammock swung.  Hearing the voices, she bent a\nlittle forward, and saw that the speakers were Dora Russell and Hester\nThornton.  Her first inclination was to laugh, toss down some leaves,\nand instantly reveal herself: the next she drew back hastily, and began\nto listen with all her ears.\n\n\"I never liked her,\" said Hester--\"I never even from the very first\npretended to like her.  I think she is underbred, and not fit to\nassociate with the other girls in the school-room.\"\n\n\"She is treated with most unfair partiality,\" retorted Miss Russell in\nher thin and rather bitter voice.  \"I have not the smallest doubt, not\nthe smallest, that she was guilty of putting those messes into my desk,\nof destroying my composition, and of caricaturing Mrs Willis in Cecil\nTemple's book.  I wonder after that Mrs Willis did not see through her,\nbut it is astonishing to what lengths favouritism will carry one.  Mrs\nWillis and Mr Everard are behaving in a very unfair way to the rest of\nus in upholding this commonplace, disagreeable girl; but it will be to\nMrs Willis's own disadvantage.  Hester, I am, as you know, leaving\nschool at Midsummer, and I shall certainly use all my influence to\ninduce my father and mother not to send the younger girls here; they\ncould not associate with a person like Miss Forest.\"\n\n\"I never take much notice of her,\" said Hester; \"but of course what you\nsay is quite right, Dora.  You have great discrimination, and your\nsisters might possibly be taken in by her.\"\n\n\"Oh, not at all, I assure you; they know a true lady when they see her.\nHowever, they must not be imperilled.  I will ask my parents to send\nthem to Mdlle.  Lablanche.  I hear that her establishment is most\n_recherche_.\"\n\n\"Mrs Willis is very nice herself, and so are most of the girls,\" said\nHester, after a pause.  Then they were both silent, for Hester had\nstooped down to examine some little fronds and moss which grew at the\nfoot of the tree.  After a pause, Hester said--\n\n\"I don't think Annie is the favourite she was with the girls.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course not; they all, in their heart of hearts, know she is\nguilty.  Will you come indoors, and have tea with me in my drawing-room,\nHester?\"\n\nThe two girls walked slowly away, and presently Annie let herself gently\nout of her hammock and dropped to the ground.\n\nShe had heard every word; she had not revealed herself, and a new and\nterrible--and, truth to say, absolutely foreign--sensation from her true\nnature now filled her mind.  She felt that she almost hated those two\nwho had spoken so cruelly, so unjustly of her.  She began to trace her\nmisfortunes and her unhappiness to the date of Hester's entrance into\nthe school.  Even more than Dora Russell did she dislike Hester; she\nmade up her mind to revenge herself on both these girls.  Her heart was\nvery, very sore; she missed the old words, the old love, the old\nbrightness, the old popularity; she missed the mother-tones in Mrs\nWillis's voice--her heart cried out for them, at night she often wept\nfor them.  She became more and more sure that she owed all her\nmisfortunes to Hester, and in a smaller degree to Dora.  Dora believed\nthat she had deliberately insulted her, and injured her composition,\nwhen she knew herself that she was quite innocent of even harbouring\nsuch a thought, far less carrying it into effect.  Well, now, she would\nreally do something to injure both these girls, and perhaps the carrying\nout of her revenge would satisfy her sore heart.\n\nCHAPTER 19. CUP AND BALL.\n\nJust toward the end of the Easter holidays, Hester Thornton was thrown\ninto a great tumult of excitement, of wonder, of half regret and half\njoy, by a letter which she received from her father.  In this letter he\ninformed her that he had made up his mind to break up his establishment\nfor several years, to go abroad, and to leave Hester altogether under\nMrs Willis's care.\n\nWhen Hester had read so far, she flung her letter on the table, put her\nhead into her hands, and burst into tears.\n\n\"Oh, how cruel of father!\" she exclaimed; \"how am I to live without ever\ngoing home--how am I to endure life without seeing my little Nan?\"\n\nHester cried bitterly; the strongest love of her nature was now given to\nthis pretty and sweet little sister, and dismal pictures rose rapidly\nbefore her of Nan growing up without in the least remembering her--\nperhaps, still worse, of Nan being unkindly treated and neglected by\nstrangers.  After a long pause, she raised her head, wiped her eyes, and\nresumed her letter.  Now, indeed, she started with astonishment, and\ngave an exclamation of delight--Sir John Thornton had arranged that Mrs\nWillis was also to receive little Nan, although she was younger than any\nother child present in the school.  Hester scarcely waited to finish her\nletter.  She crammed it into her pocket, rushed up to Susan Drummond,\nand astonished that placid young lady by suddenly kissing her.\n\n\"Nan is coming, Susy!\" she exclaimed; \"dear, darling, lovely little Nan\nis coming--oh, I am so happy!\"\n\nShe was far too impatient to explain matters to stolid Susan, and danced\ndownstairs, her eyes sparkling and smiles on her lips.  It was nothing\nto her now how long she stayed at school--her heart's treasure would be\nwith her there, and she could not but feel happy.\n\nAfter breakfast Mrs Willis sent for her, and told her what arrangements\nwere being made; she said that she was going to remove Susan Drummond\nout of Hester's bedroom, in order that Hester might enjoy her little\nsister's company at night.  She spoke very gently, and entered with full\nsympathy into the girl's delight over the little motherless sister, and\nHester felt more drawn to her governess than she had ever been.\n\nNan was to arrive at Lavender House on the following evening, and for\nthe first week her nurse was to remain with her until she got accustomed\nto her new life.\n\nThe morning of the day of Nan's arrival was also the last of the Easter\nholidays, and Hester, awakening earlier than her wont, lay in bed, and\nplanned what she would do to welcome the little one.\n\nThe idea of having Nan with her continually had softened and touched\nHester.  She was not unhappy in her school-life--indeed, there was much\nin its monotonous, busy, and healthy occupation to stimulate and rouse\nthe good in her.  Her intellect was being vigorously exercised, and, by\ncontact with her school-fellows, her character was being moulded; but\nthe perfect harmony and brightness of the school had been much\ninterrupted since Hester's arrival; her dislike to Annie Forest had been\nunfortunate in more ways than one, and that dislike, which was\nincreasing each day, was hardening Hester's heart.\n\nBut it was not hard this morning--all that was sweetest, and softest,\nand best in her had come to the surface--the little sister, whom her\nmother had left in her charge, was now to be her daily and hourly\ncompanion.  For Nan's sake, then, she must be very good; her deeds must\nbe gentle and kind, and her thoughts charitable.  Hester had an\ninstinctive feeling that baby eyes saw deep below the surface; Hester\nfelt if Nan were to lose even a shadow of her faith in her she could\nalmost die of shame.\n\nHester had been very proud of Dora Russell's friendship.  Never before\nhad it been known in the school that a first-class girl took a third\ninto such close companionship, and Hester's little head had been\nslightly turned by the fact.  Her better judgment and her better nature\nhad been rather blinded by the fascinations of this tall, graceful,\nsatirical Dora.  She had been weak enough to agree with Dora with her\nlips when in her heart of hearts she knew she was all wrong.  By nature\nHester was an honourable girl, with many fine traits in her character--\nby nature Dora was small and mean and poor of soul.\n\nThis morning Hester ran up to her favourite.\n\n\"Little Nan is coming to-night,\" she said.\n\nDora was talking at the moment to Miss Maitland, another first-class\ngirl, and the two stared rather superciliously at Hester, and, after a\npause, Dora said in her finest drawl--\n\n\"Who _is_ little Nan?\"\n\nIt was Hester's turn to stare, for she had often spoken of Nan to this\nbeloved friend, who had listened to her narrative and had appeared to\nsympathise.\n\n\"My little sister, of course,\" she exclaimed.  \"I have often talked to\nyou about her, Dora.  Are you not glad she is coming?\"\n\n\"No, my dear child, I can't say that I am.  If you wish to retain my\nfriendship, Hester, you must be careful to keep the little mite away\nfrom me; I can't bear small children.\"\n\nHester walked away with her heart swelling, and she fancied she heard\nthe two elder girls laughing as she left the play-room.\n\nMany other girls, however, in the school thoroughly sympathised with\nHester, and amongst them no one was more delighted than Susan Drummond.\n\n\"I am awfully good-natured not to be as cross as two sticks, Hetty,\" she\nexclaimed, \"for I am being turned out of my comfortable room; and whose\nroom do you suppose I am now to share? why, that little imp Annie\nForest's.\"  But Hester felt charitable, even toward Annie, on this happy\nday.\n\nIn the evening little Nan arrived.  She was a very pretty, dimpled,\nbrown-eyed creature, of just three years of age.  She had all the\nimperious ways of a spoilt baby, and, evidently, fear was a word not to\nbe found in her vocabulary.  She clung to Hester, but smiled and nodded\nto the other girls, who made advances to her, and petted her, and\nthought her a very charming baby.  Beside Nan, all the other little\ngirls in the school looked old.  She was quite, two years the youngest,\nand it was soon very evident that she would establish that most\nimperious of all reigns--a baby reign--in the school.\n\nHester fondled her and talked to her, and the little thing sat on her\nknee and stroked her face.\n\n\"Me like 'oo, Hetty,\" she said several times, and she added many other\nendearing and pretty words which caused Hester's heart to swell with\ndelight.  She alone, of all the girls, had taken no notice of the new\nplaything.  She walked to her usual corner, sat down on the floor, and\nbegan to play cup and ball for the benefit of two or three of the\nsmallest children.  Hester did not regard her in the least; she sat with\nNan on her knee, stroking back her sunny curls, and remarking on her\nvarious charms to several of the girls who sat round her.\n\n\"See, how pretty that dimple in her chin is,\" she said, \"and oh, my pet,\nyour eyes look wiser, and bigger, and saucier than ever.  Look at me,\nNan; look at your own Hetty.\"\n\nNan's attention, however, was diverted by the gayly-painted cup and ball\nwhich Annie was using with her wonted dexterity.\n\n\"Dat a pitty toy,\" she said, giving one quick and rather solemn glance\nat her sister, and again fixing her admiring gaze on the cup and ball.\n\nAnnie Forest had heard the words, and she darted a sudden, laughing look\nat the little one.  Annie's power over children was well-known.  Nan\nbegan to wriggle on Hester's knee.\n\n\"Dat a pitty lady,\" she said again, \"and dat a pitty, tibby [little]\ntoy; Nan go see.\"\n\nIn an instant, before Hester could prevent her, she had trotted across\nthe room, and was kneeling with the other children and shouting with\ndelight over Annie's play.\n\n\"She'll get her, you'll see, Hester,\" said one of the girls maliciously;\n\"she'll soon be much fonder of Annie Forest than of you.  Annie wins the\nheart of every little child in the school.\"\n\n\"She won't win my Nan's from me,\" said Hester in a confident tone; but\nin spite of her words a great pang of jealousy had gone through her.\nShe rose to her feet and followed her little sister.\n\n\"Nan, you are sleepy, you must go to bed.\"\n\n\"No, no, Hetty; me not s'eepy, me kite awake; go 'way, Hetty, Nan want\nto see the pitty tibby toy.\"\n\nAnnie raised her eyes to Hester's.  She did not really want to be\nunkind, and at that moment it had certainly never entered into her head\nto steal Hester's treasure from her, but she could not help a look of\nsuppressed delight and triumph filling her eyes.\n\nHester could scarcely bear the look; she stooped down, and taking one of\nNan's little dimpled hands tried to drag her away.\n\nInstantly Annie threw the cup and ball on the floor.\n\n\"The play is all over to-night, little darling,\" she said; \"give Annie\nForest one kiss, and run to bed with sister Hester.\"\n\nNan, who had been puckering up her face to cry, smiled instantly; then\nshe scrambled to her feet, and flung her little fat arms round Annie's\nneck.\n\n\"Dat a vedy pitty p'ay,\" she said in a patronising tone, \"and me like\n'oo, me do.\"\n\nThen she gave her hand willingly to Hester, and trotted out of the\nplay-room by her side.\n\nCHAPTER 20. IN THE SOUTH PARLOUR.\n\nImmediately after Easter the real excitement of the school-year began.\nAll the girls who had ambition, who had industry, and who had a desire\nto please distant fathers, mothers, or guardians, worked hard for that\ngreat day at Midsummer when Mrs Willis distributed her valuable prizes.\n\nFrom the moment of Hester's entrance into the school she had heard this\nday spoken of.  It was, without doubt, the greatest day of the year at\nLavender House.  Smaller prizes were given at Christmas, but the great\nhonours were always reserved for this long sunshiny June day, when Mrs\nWillis herself presented her marks of approbation to her successful\npupils.\n\nThe girls who had lived in the school for two or three years gave Hester\nvivid descriptions of the excitements, the pleasures, the delights of\nthis day of days.  In the first place, it was the first of the holidays,\nin the second it was spent almost from morning to night in the open\nair--for a great tent was erected on the lawn; and visitors thronged to\nLavender House, and fathers and mothers, and aunts and uncles, arrived\nfrom a distance to witness the triumphs of the favoured children who had\nwon the prizes.  The giving away of the prizes was, of course, _the_\nevent of the day; but there were many other minor joys.  Always in the\nevenings there was some special entertainment.  These entertainments\ndiffered from year to year, Mrs Willis allowing the girls to choose\nthem for themselves, and only making one proviso, that they must take\nall the trouble, and all the pains--in short, that they themselves must\nbe the entertainers.  One year they had tableaux vivants; another a\nfancy ball, every pretty dress of which had been designed by themselves,\nand many even made by their own industrious little fingers.  Mrs Willis\ndelighted in the interest and occupation that this yearly entertainment\ngave to her pupils, and she not only, encouraged them in their efforts\nto produce something very unique and charming, but took care that they\nshould have sufficient time to work up their ideas properly.  Always\nafter Easter she gave the girls of the three first classes two evenings\nabsolutely to themselves; and these they spent in a pretty room called\nthe South Parlour, which belonged to Mrs Willis's part of the house,\nand was rarely used, except for these great preparations.\n\nHester, therefore, after Easter found her days very full indeed.  Every\nspare moment she devoted to little Nan, but she was quite determined to\nwin a substantial prize, and she was also deeply interested in various\nschemes proposed in the South Parlour.\n\nWith regard to prizes, Mrs Willis also went on a plan of her own.  Each\ngirl was expected to come up to a certain standard of excellence in all\nher studies, and if she fell very much below this standard she was not\nallowed to try for any prize; if she came up to it, she could select one\nsubject, but only one, for competition.\n\nOn the Monday after the Easter holidays the special subjects for the\nMidsummer prizes were given out, and the girls were expected to send in\ntheir answers as to the special prize they meant to compete for by the\nfollowing Friday.\n\nWhen this day arrived Hester Thornton and Dora Russell both discovered\nthat they had made the same choice--they were going to try for the\nEnglish composition prize.  This subject always obtained one of the most\ncostly prizes, and several of the girls shook their heads over Hester's\nchoice.\n\n\"You are very silly to try for that, Hetty,\" they exclaimed, \"for Mrs\nWillis has such queer ideas with regard to English composition.  Of\ncourse, we go in for it in a general way, and learn the rules of grammar\nand punctuation, and so forth, but Mrs Willis says that school-girls'\nthemes are so bad and affected, as a rule, and she says she does not\nthink anyone will go in for her pet prize who has not natural ability.\nIn consequence, she gives only one prize for composition between the\nthree first classes.  You had better change your mind, Hetty, before it\nis too late, for much older girls will compete with you, and there are\nseveral who are going to try.\"\n\nHester, however, only smiled, and assured her eager friend that she\nwould stick to her pet subject, and try to do the best she could.\n\nOn the morning when the girls signified their choice of subject, Mrs\nWillis came into the school-room and made one of her little yearly\nspeeches with regard to the right spirit in which her girls should try\nfor these honours.  The few and well-chosen words of the head-mistress\ngenerally roused those girls who loved her best to a fever of\nenthusiasm, and even Hester, who was comparatively a newcomer, felt a\ngreat wish, as she listened to that clear and vibrating voice and\nwatched the many expressions which passed over the noble face, that she\nmight find something beyond the mere earthly honour and glory of success\nin this coming trial.  Having finished her little speech, Mrs Willis\nmade several remarks with regard to the choice of subjects.  She spoke\nof the English composition prize last, and here she heightened the\ninterest and excitement which always hung around this special prize.\nContrary to her usual rule, she would this year give no subject for an\nEnglish theme.  Each girl might choose what pleased her best.\n\nOn nearing these words Annie Forest, who had been sitting by her desk\nlooking rather dull and dejected, suddenly sprang to her feet, her face\naglow, her eyes sparkling, and began whispering vigorously to Miss Good.\n\nMiss Good nodded, and, going up to Mrs Willis, said aloud that Annie\nhad changed her mind, and that from not wishing to try for any of the\nprizes, she now intended to compete for the English composition.\n\nMrs Willis looked a little surprised, but without any comment she\nimmediately entered Annie's name in the list of competitors, and Annie\nsat down again, not even glancing at her astonished school-fellows, who\ncould not conceal their amazement, for she had never hitherto shown the\nslightest desire to excel in this department.\n\nOn the evening of this Friday the girls of the three first classes\nassembled for the first time in the South Parlour.  Hitherto these\nmeetings had been carried on in a systematic and business-like fashion.\nIt was impossible for all the girls who belonged to these three large\nclasses to assemble on each occasion.  Careful selections, therefore,\nwere, as a rule, made from their numbers.  These girls formed a\ncommittee to superintend and carry on the real preparations for the\ncoming treat, and the others only met when specially summoned by the\ncommittee to appear.\n\nAs usual now the three classes found themselves in the South Parlour--as\nusual they chattered volubly, and started schemes, to reject them again\nwith peals of laughter.  Many ideas were put forward, to be cast aside\nas utterly worthless.  No one seemed to have any very brilliant thought,\nand as the first step on these occasions was to select what the\nentertainment should be, proceedings seemed to come to a standstill.\n\nThe fact was the most daring originator, the one whoso ideas were always\nflavoured with a spice of novelty, was absolutely silent.\n\nCecil Temple, who had taken a seat near Annie, suddenly, bent forward\nand spoke to her aloud.\n\n\"We have all said what we would like, and we none of us appear to have\nthought of anything at all worth having,\" she said; \"but you have not\nspoken at all, Annie.  Give us an idea, dear--you know you originated\nthe fancy ball last year.\"\n\nThus publicly appealed to, Annie raised her full brown eyes, glanced at\nher companions, not one of whom, with the exception of Cecil, returned\nher gaze fully; then, rising to her feet, she spoke in a slightly\ncontemptuous tone.\n\n\"These preparations seem to me to be much ado about nothing; they lake\nup a lot of our time, and the results aren't worth the trouble--I have\nnothing particular to say.  Oh, well, yes, if you like--let's have blind\nman's buff and a magic lantern;\" and then, dropping a mock curtsey to\nher companions, she dashed out of the South Parlour.\n\n\"Insufferable girl!\" said Dora Russell; \"I wonder you try to draw her\nout, Cecil.  You know perfectly that we none of us care to have anything\nto do with her.\"\n\n\"I know perfectly that you are all doing your best to make her life\nmiserable,\" said Cecil, suddenly and boldly.  \"No one in this school has\nobeyed Mrs Willis's command to treat Annie as innocent--you are\npractically sending her to Coventry, and I think it is unjust and\nunfair.  You don't know, girls, that you are ruining poor Annie's\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! she doesn't seem at all dull,\" said Miss West, a second-class\ngirl.  \"I do think she's a hardened little wretch.\"\n\n\"Little you know about her,\" said Cecil, the colour fading out of her\npale face.  Then, after a pause, she added, \"The injustice of the whole\nthing is that in this treatment of Annie you break the spirit of Mrs\nWillis's command--you, none of you, certainly tell her that she is\nguilty, but you treat her as such.\"\n\nHere Hester Thornton said a daring thing.\n\n\"I don't believe Mrs Willis in her heart of hearts considers Annie\nguiltless.\"\n\nThese words of Hester's were laughed at by most of the girls, but Dora\nRussell gave her an approving nod, and Cecil, looking paler than ever,\ndropped suddenly into her seat, and no longer tried to defend her absent\nfriend.\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Miss Conway, who as the head girl of the whole\nschool was always listened to with great respect.  \"It is unfortunate\nfor the success of our entertainment that there should be all this\ndiscussion and bad feeling with regard to Miss Forest.  For my own part,\nI cannot make out why the poor little creature should be hunted down, or\nwhat affair it is of ours whether she is innocent or not.  If Mr\nEverard and Mrs Willis says she is innocent, is not that enough?  The\nfact of her guilt or innocence can't hurt us one way or another.  It is\na great pity, however, for our own sakes, that we should be out with her\nnow, for, whatever her faults, she is the only one of us who is ever\ngifted with an original thought.  But, as we can't have her, let us set\nto work without her--we really can't waste the whole evening over this\nsort of talk.\"\n\nDiscussions as to the coming pleasure were now again resumed with\nvigour, and after a great deal of animated arguing it was resolved that\ntwo short plays should be acted; that a committee should be immediately\nformed, who should select the plays, and apportion their various parts\nto the different actors.\n\nThe committee selected included Miss Russell, Miss Conway, Hester\nThornton, Cecil Temple, and two other girls of the second-class.  The\nconference then broke up, but there was a certain sense of flatness over\neverything, and Cecil was not the only girl who sighed for the merry\nmeetings of last year--when Annie had been the life and soul of all the\nproceedings, and when one brilliant idea after another with regard to\nthe costumes for the fancy ball had dropped from her merry tongue.\n\nCHAPTER 21. STEALING HEARTS.\n\nWhen Annie ran out of the South Parlour she found herself suddenly face\nto face with Mrs Willis.\n\n\"Well, my dear child,\" said the head-mistress in her kindest voice,\n\"where are you running to?  But I suppose I must not ask; you are, of\ncourse, one of the busy and secret conclave in the South Parlour?\"\n\n\"No.  I have left them,\" said Annie, bending her head, and after her\nusual habit when agitated, shaking her hair about her face.\n\n\"Left them?\" repeated Mrs Willis, \"you mean, dear, that they have sent\nyou for some message.\"\n\n\"No.  I am not one of them.  May I go into the garden, Mrs Willis?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear.\"\n\nAnnie did not even glance at her governess.  She pushed aside the baize\ndoor, and found herself in the great stone hall which led to the\nplay-room and school-room.  Her garden hat hung on a peg in the hall,\nand she tossed it off its place, and holding it in her hand ran toward\nthe side door which opened directly into the garden.  She had a wild\nwish to get to the shelter of the forsaken hammock and there cry out her\nwhole heart.  The moment she got into the open air, however, she was met\nby a whole troop of the little children, who were coming in after their\nusual short exercise before going to bed.  Miss Danesbury was with them,\nand when Annie ran out by the open door, she entered holding two little\nones by the hands.  Last in this group toddled Hester's little sister\nNan.  The moment she saw Annie her little face broke into smiles; she\nheld out two hands eagerly, and fled to the young girl's side.\n\n\"Where dat pitty toy?\" she said, raising her round face to Annie's;\n\"some one did buy dat toy, and it's vedy pitty, and me wants it--where's\ndat toy?\"\n\nAnnie stooped down, and spoke suddenly and impulsively to the little\nchild.\n\n\"You shall have the toy for your very own, Nan, if you will do something\nfor me?\"\n\nNan's baby eyes looked straight into Annie's.\n\n\"Me will,\" she said emphatically; \"me want dat toy.\"\n\n\"Put your arms round me, little darling, and give me a great, tight\nhug.\"\n\nThis request was great fun to Nan, who squeezed her little arms round\nAnnie's neck, and pressed her dimpled cheek to her lips.\n\n\"Dere,\" she said triumphantly, \"will dat do?\"\n\n\"Yes, you little treasure, and you'll try to love me, won't you?\"\n\n\"Me do,\" said Nan, in a solemn voice; but then Miss Danesbury called\nher, and she ran into the house.\n\nAs Nan trotted into the house she put up her dimpled hand to wipe\nsomething from her round cheek--it was a tear which Annie Forest had\nleft there.\n\nAnnie herself, when all the little ones had disappeared, walked slowly\nand sadly down toward the shady walk.  The sun had just set, and though\nit was now nearly May, and the evenings long, the wind was sufficiently\ncold to cause Annie to shiver in her thin house frock.  At all times\nutterly fearless with regard to her health, she gave it no thought now,\nbut entering the walk where she knew she should not be disturbed, she\nlooked up at the hammock, and wondered whether she should climb into it.\nShe decided, however, not to do so--the great and terrible weight of\ntears which had pressed close to her heart were relieved by Nan's\nembrace; she no longer cared to cry until she could cry no longer--the\nworst of her pain had been soothed by the sweet baby graciousness of the\nlittle one.\n\nThen there darted into poor Annie's sore heart and perplexed brain that\ndangerous thought and temptation which was to work so much future pain\nand trouble.  She already loved little Nan, and Nan, as most children\ndid, had taken a fancy to her.  Annie stood still, and clasped her hands\nas the dark idea came to her to steal the heart of little Nan from\nHester, and so revenge herself on her.  By doing this she would touch\nHester in her most vulnerable point--she would take from her what she\nvalued most.  The temptation came swiftly, and Annie listened to it, and\nthought how easy it would be to carry it into effect.  She knew well\nthat no little child could resist her when she chose to exercise her\ncharms--it would be easy, easy work to make that part of Nan which was\nmost precious all her own.  Annie became fascinated by the idea; how\ncompletely then she would have revenged all her wrongs on Hester!  Some\nday Hester would bitterly repent of her unjust prejudice toward her;\nsome day Hester would come to her, and beg of her in agony to give her\nback her darling's love; ah! when that day came it would be her turn to\ntriumph.\n\nShe felt more than satisfied as the temptation grew upon her; she shut\nout persistently from her view all the other side of the picture; she\nwould not let herself think that the work she was about to undertake was\ncruel and mean.  Hester had been more than unjust, and she was going to\npunish her.\n\nAnnie paced faster and faster up and down the shady walk, and whenever\nher resolution wavered, the memory of Hester's face as she had seen it\nthe same night in the South Parlour came visibly back and strengthened\nit.  Yes, her turn had come at last.  Hester had contrived since her\nentrance into the school to make Annie's life thoroughly miserable.\nWell, never mind, it was Annie's turn now to make her wretched.\n\nCHAPTER 22. IN BURN CASTLE WOOD.\n\nIn concentrating her thoughts of revenge on Hester Annie ceased to\ntrouble her head about Dora Russell.  She considered Hester a crueller\nenemy than Dora.  Hester belonged to her own set, worked in her own\nclass, and would naturally, had things not turned out so unjustly, so\nunfairly, have been her friend, and not her enemy.  Dora had nothing to\nsay to Annie, and before Hester's advent into the school had scarcely\nnoticed her existence.  Annie therefore concentrated all her powers on\npunishing Hester.  This gave her an aim and an occupation, and at first\nshe felt that her revenge might give her real pleasure.\n\nSusan Drummond now shared Annie's bedroom, and Annie was rather startled\none evening to hear this phlegmatic young person burst out into a strong\ntirade against Hester and Dora.  Dora had managed, for some inexplicable\nreason, to offend Susan, and Susan now looked to Annie for sympathy, and\nboldly suggested that they should get up what she was pleased to call \"a\nlark\" between them for the punishment of this very dignified young lady.\n\nAnnie had never liked Susan, and she now stared at her, and said in her\nquick way--\n\n\"You won't catch me helping you in any of your larks.  I've had trouble\nenough on that score as it is.\"\n\nSusan gazed at her stupidly, and a dull read spread over her face.\n\n\"But I thought you hated Dora and Hester,\" she said--\"I'm sure they hate\nyou.\"\n\nAnnie was silent.\n\n\"You do hate them, don't you?\" persisted Miss Drummond.\n\n\"It's nothing to you what I feel toward them, Susy,\" said Annie.\n\"Please don't disturb me with any more of your chatter; I am very\nsleepy, and you are keeping me awake.\"  Thus silenced, Susan had to\ncontent herself by turning on her back, and going into the land of\ndreams; but she was evidently a good deal surprised and disappointed,\nand began to entertain a certain respect, and even fear, of Annie, which\nhad been hitherto unknown to her.\n\nMeanwhile Hester was very busy, very happy, and more satisfied--brighter\nand better employed than she had ever been in her life before.  Nan's\nlove satisfied the affectionate side of her nature, and all her\nintellect was strained to the utmost to win honours in the coming\nstruggle.\n\nShe had stuck firmly to her resolve to work for the English composition\nprize, and she firmly made up her own mind to leave no stone unturned to\nwin it.  What affection she, possessed for Miss Russell was not at all\nof a character to prevent her from thoroughly enjoying taking the prize\nout of her hands.  Her love for Dora had been fed by vanity, and was not\nat all of a deep or noble character.  She was some time carefully\nchoosing the subject of her theme, and at last she resolved to write a\nbrief historical description of the last days of Marie Antoinette.  To\nwrite properly on this subject she had to read up a great deal, and had\nto find references in books which were not usually allowed as\nschool-room property.  Mrs Willis, however, always allowed the girls\nwho were working for the English composition prize to have access to her\nrather extensive library, and here Hester was often to be found during\nplay-hours.  Two evenings in the week were also taken up in preparation\nfor the coming plays, and as Hester was to take rather an important part\nin one, and a small character in another, she was obliged to devote\nherself to getting up her parts during the weekly half-holidays.  Thus\nevery moment was busy, and, except at night, she had little time to\ndevote herself to Nan.\n\nNan slept in a pretty crib in Hester's room, and each evening the young\ngirl knelt down by her sister's side, and gazed at her with love which\nwas almost motherly swelling in her breast.\n\nAll that was best of Hester was drawn out at these moments; something\ngreater than ambition--something far and away above school triumphs and\nschool jealousies spoke then in her heart of hearts.  These moments\nfound her capable of being both sympathising and forgiving; these\nmoments followed out in her daily life might have made Hester almost\ngreat.  Now was the time, with her eyes full of tears and her lips\ntrembling with emotion, for Annie Forest to have caught a glimpse of the\ndivine in Hester; the hardness, the pride, the haughty spirit were all\nlaid aside, and hers was the true child-heart as she knelt by the\nsleeping baby.  Hester prayed earnestly at these moments, and, in truth,\nNan did better for her than any sermon; better for her than even Mrs\nWillis's best influences.  Nan was as the voice of God to her sister.\n\nHester, in her very busy life, had no time to notice, however, a very\nslight and almost imperceptible change in bright little Nan.  In the\nmornings she was in too great a hurry to pay much heed to the little\none's chatter; in the afternoons she had scarcely an instant to devote\nto her, and when she saw her playing happily with the other children she\nwas quite content, and always supposed that when a spare half-hour did\ncome in her busy life Nan would rush to her with the old ecstasy, and\ngive her the old devotion.\n\nOne day, toward the end of a very fine May, the girls were all to go for\na picnic to some woods about four miles away.  They had looked forward\nfor several days to this relaxation, and were in the highest state of\ndelight and the wildest spirits.  After an early dinner they were to\ndrive in several large waggonettes to the place of _rendezvous_, where\nthey were to be regaled with gypsy-tea, and were to have a few hours in\nthe lovely Woods or Burn Castle, one of the show places of the\nneighbourhood.  Mrs Willis had invited the Misses Bruce to accompany\nthem, and they were all to leave the house punctually at two o'clock.\nThe weather was wonderfully fine and warm, and it was decided that all\nthe children, even Nan, should go.\n\nPerhaps none of the girls looked forward to this day's pleasure with\ngreater joy than did Hester; she determined to make it a real holiday,\nand a real time of relaxation.  She would forget her English theme; she\nwould cease to worry herself about Marie Antoinette; she would cease to\nrepeat her part in the coming play; and she would devote herself\nexclusively and determinedly to Nan's pleasure.  She pictured the little\none's raptures; she heard her gay shouts of joy, her ceaseless little\nrippling chatter, her baby glee, and, above all things, her intense\nhappiness at being with her own Hetty for the greater part of a whole\nday.  Hester would ride her on her shoulder, would race with her; all\nher usual, companions would be as nothing to her on this occasion, she\nwould give herself up solely to Nan.\n\nAs she was dressing that morning she said a word or two to the child\nabout the coming treat.\n\n\"We'll light a fire in the wood, Nan, and hang a kettle over it, and\nmake tea--such good tea; won't it be nice?\"\n\nNan clapped her hands.  \"And may I take out my little ummabella\n(umbrella), case it might wain?\" she asked anxiously.\n\nHester flew to her and kissed her.\n\n\"You funny darling!\" she said.  \"Oh, we shall have such a day!  You'll\nbe with your own Hetty all day long--your own Hetty; won't you be glad?\"\n\n\"Me am,\" said Nan; \"own Hetty, and own Annie; me am glad.\"\n\nHester scarcely heard the last words, for the prayer-gong sounded, and\nshe had to fly downstairs.\n\nAt dinner time the girls were discussing who would go with each, and all\nwere very merry and full of fun.\n\n\"Miss Danesbury will take the little children,\" said Miss Good.  \"Mrs\nWillis says that all the little ones are to be in Miss Danesbury's\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Oh, please,\" said Hester suddenly, \"may Nan come with me, Miss Good?\nShe'll be so disappointed if she doesn't, and I'll take such care of\nher.\"\n\nMiss Good nodded a careless acquiescence, and Hester proceeded with her\ndinner, feeling thoroughly satisfied.\n\nImmediately after dinner the girls flew to their rooms to prepare for\ntheir expedition.  Hastily opening a drawer, Hester pulled out a white\nfrock, white pique pelisse, and washing hat for Nan--she meant her\ndarling to look as charming as possible.\n\n\"Oh, dear, Miss Danesbury should have brought her here by now,\" she said\nto herself impatiently, and then, hearing the crunching of carriage\nwheels on the drive, she flew to the bell and rang it.\n\nIn a few moments one of the maids appeared.\n\n\"Do you know where Miss Nan is, Alice?  She is to go to Burn Castle with\nme, and I want to dress her, for it is nearly time to go.\"\n\nAlice looked a little surprised.\n\n\"If you please, Miss,\" she said, \"I think Miss Nan has just gone.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Alice?  Miss Good said especially she was to go with\nme.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that, Miss; I only know that I saw Miss Forest\ncarrying her downstairs in her arms about three minutes ago, and they\nwent off in the waggonette with all the other little children and Miss\nDanesbury.\"\n\nHester stood perfectly still, her colour changed from red to white; for\nfull half a minute she was silent.  Then, hearing voices from below\ncalling to her, she said in a cold, quiet tone--\n\n\"That will do, Alice; thank you for letting me know.\"  She turned to her\ndrawer and put back Nan's white and pretty things, and also replaced a\nnew and very becoming shady hat which she had meant to wear herself.  In\nher old winter hat, and looking almost untidy for her, she walked slowly\ndownstairs and took her place in the waggonette which was drawn up at\nthe door.\n\nCecil Temple and one or two other girls whom Hester liked very much were\nin the same waggonette, but she scarcely cared to talk to them, and only\njoined in their laughter by a strong effort.  She was deeply wounded,\nbut her keenest present desire was to hide any feelings of jealousy she\nhad toward Annie from the quick eyes of her school-fellows.\n\n\"Why,\" suddenly exclaimed Julia Morris, a particularly unobservant girl,\n\"I thought you were going to bring that dear baby sister with you,\nHester.  Oh, I do hope there is nothing the matter with her.\"\n\n\"Nan has gone on in the first waggonette with the little children,\" said\nHester as cheerfully as she could speak, but she coloured slightly, and\nsaw that Cecil was regarding her attentively.\n\nSusan Drummond exclaimed suddenly--\n\n\"I saw Annie Forest rushing down the stairs with little Nan, and Nan had\nher arms round her neck, and was laughing merrily.  You need not be\nanxious about Nan, Hester; she was quite content to go with Annie.\"\n\n\"I did not say I was anxious,\" replied Hester in a cold voice.  \"How\nvery beautiful that avenue of beech trees is, Cecil!\"\n\n\"But Annie heard Miss Good say that you were to take Nan,\" persisted\nJulia Morris.  \"She could not but have noticed it, for you did flush up\nso, Hester, and looked so eager.  I never saw anyone more in earnest\nabout a trifle in my life; it was impossible for Annie not to have\nheard.\"\n\n\"The great thing is that Nan is happy,\" said Hester in a fretted voice.\n\"Do let us change the subject, girls.\"\n\nCecil instantly began talking about the coming plays, and soon the\nconversation became of an absorbing character, and Hester's voice was\nheard oftener than the others, and she laughed more frequently than her\ncompanions.\n\nFor all this forced merriment, however, Cecil did not fail to observe\nthat when Hester got to the place of meeting at Burn Castle she looked\naround her with a quick and eager glance.  Then the colour faded from\nher face, and her eyes grew dim.\n\nThat look of pain on Hester's face was quite enough for kind-hearted\nCecil.  She had thrown herself on the grass with an exclamation of\ndelight, but in an instant she was on her feet.\n\n\"Now, of course, the first thing is to find little Nan,\" she said;\n\"she'll be missing you dreadful, Hetty.\"\n\nCecil held out her hand to Hester to run with her through the wood, but,\nto her surprise, Hester drew back.\n\n\"I'm tired,\" she said; \"I daresay we shall find Nan presently.  She is\nsure to be safe, as she is under Miss Danesbury's care.\"\n\nCecil made no remark, but set off by herself to find the little\nchildren.  Presently, standing on a little knoll, and putting her two\nhands round her lips, so as to form a speaking trumpet, she shouted to\nHester.  Hester came slowly and apparently unwillingly toward her, but\nwhen she got to the foot of the knoll, Cecil flew down, and, taking her\nby the hand, ran with her to the top.\n\n\"Oh, do come quick!\" she exclaimed; \"it is such a pretty sight.\"\n\nDown in the valley about fifty yards away were the ten or twelve little\nchildren who formed the infant portion of the school.  Miss Danesbury\nwas sitting at some distance off quietly reading, and the children,\ndecked with flowers, and carrying tall grasses and reeds in their hands,\nwere flying round and round in a merry circle, while in their midst, and\nthe centre of attraction, stood Annie, whose hat was tossed aside, and\nwhose bright, curling hair was literally crowned with wild flowers.  On\nAnnie's shoulder stood little Nan, carefully and beautifully poised, and\nround Nan's wavy curls was a starry wreath of wood-anemones.  Nan was\nshouting gleefully and clapping her hands, while Annie balanced her\nslightest movement with the greatest agility, and kept her little feet\nsteady on her shoulders with scarcely an effort.  As the children ran\nround and round Annie she waltzed gracefully backwards and forwards to\nmeet them, and they all sang snatches of nursery rhymes.  When Cecil and\nHester appeared they had reached in their varied collection--\n\n  \"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,\n  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.\"\n\nHere Nan exclaimed, in her clear, high-pitched voice--\n\n\"Me no fall, Annie,\" and the small children on the ground clapped their\nhands and blew kisses to her.\n\n\"Isn't it pretty?  Isn't Annie sweet with children?\" said Cecil, looking\nround to Hester with all the admiration she felt for her friend shining\nin her face.  The expression, however, which Hester wore at that moment\nreally startled Cecil: she was absolutely colourless, and presently she\ncalled aloud in a harsh, strained voice--\n\n\"Be careful of her!  How wicked of you to put her like that on your\nshoulder!  She will fall--yes, I know she will fall; oh, do be careful!\"\n\nHester's voice startled the children, who ceased sinking and dancing:\nAnnie made a hasty step forward, and one little voice alone kept singing\nout the words--\n\n\"Humpty Dumpty got a great fall!\" when there was a crash and a cry, and\nNan, in some inexplicable way, had fallen backwards from Annie's\nshoulders.\n\nIn one instant Hester was in the midst of the group.\n\n\"Don't touch her,\" she said, as Annie flew to pick up the child, who,\nfalling with some force on her head, had been stunned; \"don't touch\nher--don't dare!  It was your doing; you did it on purpose--you wished\nto do it!\"\n\n\"You are unjust,\" said Annie, in a low tone.  \"Nan was perfectly safe\nuntil you startled her.  Like all the rest you are unjust.  Nan would\nhave come to no harm if you had not spoken.\"\n\nHester did not vouchsafe another word.  She sat on the ground with the\nunconscious and pretty little flower-crowned figure laid across her lap;\nshe was terrified, and thought in her inexperience that Nan must be\ndead.\n\nAt the first mention of the accident Cecil had flown to fetch some\nwater, and when she and Miss Danesbury applied it to little Nan's\ntemples, she presently sighed, and opened her brown eyes wide.\n\n\"I hope--I trust she is not much hurt,\" said Miss Danesbury; \"but I\nthink it safest to take her home at once.  Cecil, dear, can you do\nanything about fetching a waggonette round to the stile at the entrance\nof the wood?  Now the puzzle is, who is to take care of the rest of the\nlittle children?  If only they were under Miss Good's care, I should\nbreathe more easily.\"\n\n\"I am going home with Nan,\" said Hester, in a hard voice.\n\n\"Of course, my love: no one would think of parting you from your little\nsister,\" said the governess soothingly.\n\n\"If you please, Miss Danesbury,\" said Annie, whose face was quite as\npale as Hester's, and her eyes heavy as though she longed to cry, \"will\nyou trust me with the little ones?  If you do, I will promise to take\nthem straight to Miss Good, and to be most careful of them.\"\n\nMiss Danesbury's gentle and kind face looked relieved.\n\n\"Thank you, Annie--of course I trust you, dear.  Take the children at\nonce to the meeting-place under the great oak, and wait there until Miss\nGood appears.\"\n\nAnnie suddenly sprang forward, and threw her arms round Miss Danesbury's\nneck.\n\n\"Miss Danesbury, you comfort me,\" she said, in a kind of stifled voice,\nand then she ran off with the children.\n\nCHAPTER 23. \"HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL.\"\n\nAll the stupor and languor which immediately followed Nan's fall passed\noff during her drive home; she chatted and laughed, her cheeks were\nflushed, her eyes bright.  Hester turned with a relieved face to Miss\nDanesbury.\n\n\"My little darling is all right, is she not?\" she said.  \"Oh, I was so\nterrified--oh, how thankful I am no harm has been done!\"\n\nMiss Danesbury did not return Hester's full gaze; she attempted to take\nlittle Nan on her knee, but Nan clung to Hetty.  Then she said--\n\n\"You must be careful to keep the sun off her, dear--hold your parasol\nwell down--just so.  That is better.  When we get home, I will put her\nto bed at once.  Please God, there _is_ nothing wrong; cut one cannot be\ntoo careful.\"\n\nSomething in Miss Danesbury's manner affected Hester strangely; she\nclasped Nan's slight baby form closer and closer to her heart, and no\nlonger joined in the little one's mirth.  As the drive drew to a close,\nNan again ceased talking, and fell into a heavy sleep.\n\nMiss Danesbury's face grew graver and graver, and, when the waggonette\ndrew up at Lavender House, she insisted on lifting the sleeping child\nout of Hester's arms, and carrying her up to her little crib.  When\nNan's little head was laid on the cool pillow, she again opened her\neyes, and instantly asked for a drink.  Miss Danesbury gave her some\nmilk and water, but the moment she drank it she was sick.\n\n\"Just as I feared,\" said the governess; \"there is some little mischief--\nnot much, I hope--but we must instantly send for the doctor.\"\n\nAs Miss Danesbury walked across the room to ring the bell, Hester\nfollowed her.\n\n\"She's not in danger?\" she whispered in a hoarse voice; \"if she is,\nAnnie is guilty of murder.\"\n\n\"Don't, my dear,\" said the governess; \"you must keep quiet for Nan's\nsake.  Please God, she will soon be better.  All I really apprehend is a\nlittle excitement and feverishness, which will pass off in a few days\nwith care.  Hester, my dear, I suddenly remember that the house is\nnearly empty, for all the servants are also enjoying a holiday.  I think\nI must send you for Dr Mayflower.  The waggonette is still at the door.\nDrive at once to town, my dear, and ask the coachman to take you to\nNumber 10, The Parade.  If you are very quick, you will catch Dr\nMayflower before he goes out on his afternoon rounds.\"\n\nHester glanced for half an instant at Nan, but her eyes were again\nclosed.\n\n\"I will take the best care of her,\" said the governess in a kind voice;\n\"don't lose an instant, dear.\"\n\nHester snatched up her hat and flew downstairs.  In a moment she was in\nthe waggonette, and the driver was speedily urging his horses in the\ndirection of the small town of Sefton, two miles and a half away.\nHester was terrified now--so terrified, in such an agony, that she even\nforgot Annie; her hatred toward Annie became of secondary importance to\nher.  All her ideas, all her thoughts, were swallowed up in the one\ngreat hope--Should she be in time to reach Dr Mayflower's house before\nhe set off on his afternoon rounds?  As the waggonette approached Sefton\nshe buried her face in her hands and uttered a sharp inward cry of\nagony.\n\n\"Please God, let me find the doctor!\"  It was a real prayer from her\nheart of hearts.  The waggonette drew up at the doctor's residence, to\ndiscover him stepping into his brougham.  Hester was a shy child, and\nhad never seen him before; but she instantly raised her voice, and\nalmost shouted to him--\"You are to come with me; please, you are to come\nat once.  Little Nan is ill--she is hurt.  Please, you are to come at\nonce.\"\n\n\"Eh! young lady?\" said the round-faced doctor.  \"Oh!  I see; you are one\nof the little girls from Lavender House.  Is anything wrong there,\ndear?\"\n\nHester managed to relate what had occurred; whereupon the doctor\ninstantly opened the door of the waggonette.\n\n\"Jump out, young lady,\" he said; \"I will drive you back in my brougham.\nMasters,\" addressing his coachman, \"to Lavender House.\"\n\nHester sat back in the soft-cushioned carriage, which bowled smoothly\nalong the road.  It seemed to her impatience that the pace at which they\nwent was not half quick enough--she longed to put her head out of the\nwindow to shout to the coachman to go faster.  She felt intensely\nprovoked with the doctor, who sat placidly by her side reading a\nnewspaper.\n\nPresently she saw that his eyes were fixed on her.  He spoke in his\nquietest tones.\n\n\"We always take precisely twenty minutes to drive from the Parade to\nLavender House--twenty minutes, neither more nor less.  We shall be\nthere now in exactly ten minutes.\"  Hester tried to smile, but failed;\nher agony of apprehension grew and grew.  She breathed more freely when\nthey turned into the avenue.  When they stopped at the wide stone porch,\nand the doctor got out, she uttered a sigh of relief.\n\nShe took Dr Mayflower herself up to Nan's room.  Miss Danesbury opened\nthe door, the doctor went inside, and Hester crouched down on the\nlanding and waited.  It seemed to her that the good physician would\nnever come out.  When he did she raised a perfectly blanched face to\nhis, she opened her lips, tried to speak, but no words would come.  Her\nagitation was so intense that the kind-hearted doctor took instant pity\non her.\n\n\"Come into this room, my child,\" he said.  \"My dear, you will be ill\nyourself if you give way like this.  Pooh! pooh! this agitation is\nextreme--is uncalled for.  You have got a shock.  I shall prescribe a\nglass of sherry at once.  Come downstairs with me, and I will see that\nyou get one.\"\n\n\"But how is she, sir--how is she?\" poor Hester managed to articulate.\n\n\"Oh! the little one--sweet, pretty, little darling.  I did not know she\nwas your sister--a dear little child.  She got an ugly fall, though--\ncame on a nasty place.\"\n\n\"But, please, sir, how is she?  She--she--she is not in danger?\"\n\n\"Danger? by no means, unless you put her into it.  She must be kept very\nquiet, and, above all things, not excited.  I will come to see her again\nto-morrow morning.  With proper care she ought to be quite herself in a\nfew days.  Ah! now you've got a little colour in your cheek, come down\nwith me and have that glass of sherry, and you will feel all right.\"\n\nCHAPTER 24. ANNIE TO THE RESCUE.\n\nThe picnic-party arrived home late.  The accident to little Nan had not\nshortened the day's pleasure, although Mrs Willis, the moment she heard\nof it, had come back; for she entered the hall just as the doctor was\nstepping into his carriage.  He gave her his opinion, and said that he\ntrusted no further mischief, beyond a little temporary excitement, had\nbeen caused.  He again, however, spoke of the great necessity of keeping\nNan quiet, and said that her school-fellows must not come to her, and\nthat she must not be excited in any way.  Mrs Willis came into the\ngreat hall where Hester was standing.  Instantly she went up to the\nyoung girl, and put her arm around and drew her to her side.\n\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"this is a grievous anxiety for you; no words can\nexpress my sorrow and my sympathy; but the doctor is quite hopeful,\nHester, and, please God, we shall soon have the little one as well as\never.\"\n\n\"You are really sorry for me?\" said Hester, raising her eyes to the\nhead-mistress's face.\n\n\"Of course, dear; need you ask?\"\n\n\"Then you will have that wicked Annie Forest punished--well punished--\nwell punished.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, Hester,\" said Mrs Willis very gravely, \"God takes the\npunishment of our wrongdoings into His own hands.  Annie came home with\nme.  Had you seen her face as we drove together you would not have asked\n_me_ to punish her.\"\n\n\"Unjust, always unjust,\" muttered Hester, but in so low a voice that\nMrs Willis did not hear the words.  \"Please may I go to little Nan?\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Certainly, Hester--some tea shall be sent up to you presently.\"\n\nMiss Danesbury arranged to spend that night in Nan's room.  A sofa bed\nwas brought in for her to lie on, for Mrs Willis had yielded to\nHester's almost feverish entreaties that she might not be banished from\nher little sister.  Not a sound reached the room where Nan was lying--\neven the girls took off their shoes as they passed the door--not a\nwhisper came to disturb the sick child.  Little Nan slept most of the\nevening, only sometimes opening her eyes and looking up drowsily when\nMiss Danesbury changed the cold application to her head.  At nine\no'clock there came a low tap at the room door.  Hester went to open it;\none of her school-fellows stood without.\n\n\"The prayer-gong is not to be sounded to-night.  Will you come to the\nchapel now?  Mrs Willis sent me to ask.\"\n\nHester shook her head.\n\n\"I cannot,\" she whispered; \"tell her I cannot come.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry?\" replied the girl; \"is Nan very bad?\"\n\n\"I don't know: I hope not.  Good-night.\"\n\nHester closed the room door, took off her dress, and began very softly\nto prepare to get into bed.  She put on her dressing-gown, and knelt\ndown as usual to her private prayers.  When she got on her knees,\nhowever, she found it impossible to pray; her brain felt in a whirl, her\nfeelings were unprayerlike; and with the temporary relief of believing\nNan in no immediate danger came such a flood of hatred toward Annie as\nalmost frightened her.  She tried to ask God to make Nan better--quite\nwell; but even this petition seemed to go no way--to reach no one--to\nfall flat on the empty air.  She rose from her knees, and got quietly\ninto bed.\n\nNan lay in that half-drowsy and languid state until midnight.  Hester,\nwith all her very slight expedience of illness, thought that as long as\nNan was quiet she must be getting better; but Miss Danesbury was by no\nmeans so sure, and, notwithstanding the doctor's verdict, she felt\nanxious about the child.  Hester had said that she could not sleep; but\nat Miss Danesbury's special request she got into bed, and before she\nknew anything about it was in a sound slumber.  At midnight, when all\nthe house was quiet, and Miss Danesbury kept a lonely watch by the sick\nchild's pillow, there came a marked change for the worse in the little\none.  She opened her feverish eyes wide and began to call out piteously;\nbut her cry now was, not for Hester, but for Annie.\n\n\"Me want my Annie,\" she said over and over, \"me do, me do.  No, no; go\n'way, naughty Daybury, me want my Annie; me do want her.\"\n\nMiss Danesbury felt puzzled and distressed.  Hester, however, was\nawakened by the piteous cry, and sat up in bed.\n\n\"What is it, Miss Danesbury?\" she asked.\n\n\"She is very much excited, Hester; she is calling for Annie Forest.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is quite impossible,\" said Hester, a shudder passing through\nher.  \"Annie can't come here.  The doctor specially said that none of\nthe girls were to come near Nan.\"\n\n\"Me want Annie; me want my own Annie,\" wailed the sick child.\n\n\"Give me my dressing-gown, please, Miss Danesbury, and I will go to\nher,\" said Hester.\n\nShe sprang out of bed, and approached the little crib.  The brightness\nof Nan's feverish eyes was distinctly seen.  She looked up at Hester,\nwho bent over her; then she uttered a sharp cry and covered her little\nface.\n\n\"Go 'way, go 'way, naughty Hetty--Nan want Annie; Annie sing, Annie p'ay\nwith Nan--go 'way, go 'way, Hetty.\"\n\nHester's heart was too full to allow her to speak; but she knelt by the\ncrib and tried to take one of the little hot hands in hers.  Nan,\nhowever, pushed her hands away, and now began to cry loudly.\n\n\"Annie!--Annie!--Annie! me want 'oo; Nan want 'oo--poor tibby Nan want\n'oo, Annie!\"\n\nMiss Danesbury touched Hester on her shoulder.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"the child's wish must be gratified.  Annie has an\nextraordinary power over children, and under the circumstances I shall\ntake it upon me to disobey the doctor's directions.  The child must be\nquieted at all hazards.  Run for Annie, dear--you know her room.  I had\nbetter stay with little Nan, for, though she loves you best, you don't\nsoothe her at present--that is often so with a fever case.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Hester.  She turned again to the little crib.\n\n\"Hetty is going to fetch Annie for Nan.  Will Nan give her own Hetty one\nkiss?\"\n\nInstantly the little arms were flung round Hester's neck.\n\n\"Me like 'oo now, dood Hetty.  Go for Annie, dood Hetty.\"  Instantly\nHester ran out of the room.  She flew quickly down the long passage, and\ndid not know what a strange little figure she made as the moon from a\nlarge window at one end fell full upon her.  So eerie, so ghost-like was\nher appearance as she flew noiselessly with her bare feet along the\npassage that some one--Hester did not know whom--gave a stifled cry.\nThe cry seemed to come from a good way off, and Hester was too\npreoccupied to notice it.  She darted into the room where Susan Drummond\nand Annie Forest slept.\n\n\"Annie you are to come to Nan,\" she said in a sharp high-pitched voice\nwhich she scarcely recognised as her own.\n\n\"Coming,\" said Annie, and she walked instantly to the door with her\ndress on, and stood in the moonlight.\n\n\"You are dressed!\" said Hester in astonishment.\n\n\"I could not undress--I lay down as I was.  I fancied I heard Nan's\nvoice calling me.  I guessed I should be sent for.\"\n\n\"Well, come now,\" said Hester in her hardest tones.  \"You were only sent\nfor because Nan must be quieted at any risk.  Come, and see if you can\nquiet her.  I don't suppose,\" with a bitter laugh, \"that you will\nsucceed.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" replied Annie, in a very soft and gentle tone.\n\nShe walked back by Hester's side and entered the sick-room.  She walked\nstraight up to the little cot, and knelt down by Nan, and said, in that\nstrangely melodious voice of hers--\n\n\"Little darling, Annie has come.\"\n\n\"Me like 'oo,\" said Nan, with a satisfied coo in her voice, and she\nturned round on her side, with her back to Miss Danesbury and Hester,\nand her eyes fixed on Annie.\n\n\"Sing `Four-and-twenty,' Annie; sing `Four-and-twenty,'\" she said\npresently.\n\n\"Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie,\" sang Annie in a low clear\nvoice, without a moment's hesitation.  She went through the old nursery\nrhyme once--twice.  Then Nan interrupted her fretfully--\n\n\"Me don't want dat 'dain; sing `Boy Blue,' Annie.\"\n\nAnnie sang.\n\n\"`Tree Little Kittens,' Annie,\" interrupted the little voice presently.\n\nFor more than two hours Annie knelt by the child, singing nursery rhyme\nafter nursery rhyme, while the bright beautiful eyes were fixed on her\nface, and the little voice said incessantly--\n\n\"Sing, Annie--sing.\"\n\n\"`Baby Bun,' now,\" said Nan, when Annie had come almost to the end of\nher selection.\n\n  \"Bye baby bunting,\n  Daddy's gone a-hunting--\n  He's gone to fetch a rabbit-skin,\n  To place the baby bunting in.\"\n\nOver and over and over did Annie sing the words.  Whenever, even for a\nbrief moment she paused, Nan said--\n\n\"Sing, Annie--sing `Baby Bun.'\"\n\nAnd all the time the eyes remained wide-open, and the little hands were\nburning hot; but, gradually, after more than two hours of constant\nsinging, Annie began to fancy that the burning skin was cooler.  Then--\ncould she believe it?--she saw the lids droop over the wide-open eyes.\nFive minutes later, to the tune of \"Baby Bunting,\" Nan had fallen into a\ndeep and sound sleep.\n\nCHAPTER 25. A SPOILT BABY.\n\nIn the morning Nan was better, and although for days she was in a very\nprecarious state, and had to be kept as quiet as possible, yet Miss\nDanesbury's great dread that fever would set in had passed away.  The\ndoctor said, however, that Nan had barely escaped real injury to her\nbrain, and that it would be many a day before she would romp again, and\nplay freely and noisily with the other children.  Nan had chosen her own\nnurse, and with the imperiousness of all babies--to say nothing of sick\nbabies--she had her way.  From morning till night Annie remained with\nher, and when the doctor saw how Annie alone could soothe and satisfy\nthe child he would not allow it to be otherwise.  At first Nan would lie\nwith her hand in Annie's, and her little cry of \"Sing, Annie,\" going on\nfrom lime to time; but as she grew better Annie would sit with her by\nthe open window, with her head pillowed on her breast, and her arm round\nthe little slender form, and Nan would smile and look adoringly at\nAnnie, who would often return her gaze with intense sadness, and an\nindescribable something in her face which caused the little one to\nstroke her cheek tenderly, and say in her sweet baby voice--\n\n\"Poor Annie; poor tibby Annie!\"\n\nThey made a pretty picture as they sat there.  Annie, with her charming\ngypsy face, her wild, luxuriant, curly hair, all the sauciness and\nunrest in her soothed by the magic of the little child's presence; and\nthe little child herself, with her faint wild-rose colour, her dark deep\neyes, clear as summer pools, and her sunshiny golden hair.  But pretty\nas the picture was Hester loathed it, for Hester thought during these\nwretched days that her heart would break.\n\nNot that Nan turned away from Hetty; she petted her and kissed her and\nsometimes put an arm round Hetty and an arm round Annie, as though, if\nshe could, she would draw them together; but anyone could see that her\nheart of hearts was given to Annie, and that Hester ranked second in her\nlove.  Hester would not for worlds express any of her bitter feelings\nbefore Annie; nay, as the doctor and Miss Danesbury both declared that,\nhowever culpable Annie might have been in causing the accident, she had\nsaved little Nan's life by her wonderful skill in soothing her to sleep\non the first night of her illness, Hester had felt obliged to grumble\nsomething which might have been taken for \"thanks.\"\n\nAnnie, in reply to this grumble, had bestowed upon Hester one of her\nquickest, brightest glances, for she fathomed the true state of Hester's\nheart toward her well enough.\n\nThese were very bad days for poor Hester, and but for the avidity with\nwhich she threw herself into her studies she could scarcely have borne\nthem.\n\nBy slow degrees Nan got better; she was allowed to come downstairs and\nto sit in Annie's arms in the garden, and then Mrs Willis interfered,\nand said that Annie must go back to her studies, and only devote her\nusual play-hours and half-holidays to Nan's service.\n\nThis mandate, however, produced woe and tribulation.  The spoilt child\nscreamed and beat her little hands, and worked herself up into such a\npitch of excitement that that night she found her way in her sleep to\nAnnie's room, and Annie had to quiet her by taking her into her bed.  In\nthe morning the doctor had to be sent for, and he instantly prescribed a\nday or two more of Annie's company for the child.\n\nMrs Willis felt dreadfully puzzled.  She had undertaken the charge of\nthe little one: her father was already far away, so it was impossible\nnow to make any change of plans; the child was ill--had been injured by\nan accident caused by Annie's carelessness and by Hester's want of\nself-control.  But weak and ill as Nan still was, Mrs Willis felt that\nan undue amount of spoiling was good for no one.  She thought it highly\nunjust to Annie to keep her from her school employments at this most\nimportant period of the year.  If Annie did not reach a certain degree\nof excellence in her school marks she could not be promoted in her\nclass.  Mrs Willis did not expect the wild and heedless girl to carry\noff any special prizes; but her abilities were quite up to the average,\nand she always hoped to rouse sufficient ambition in her to enable her\nto acquire a good and sound education.  Mrs Willis knew how necessary\nthis was for poor Annie's future, and, after giving the doctor an\nassurance that Nan's whims and pleasures should be attended to for the\nnext two or three days, she determined at the end of that time to assert\nher own authority with the child, and to insist on Annie working hard at\nher lessons, and returning to her usual school-room life.\n\nOn the morning of the third day Mrs Willis made inquiries, heard that\nNan had spent an excellent night, eaten a hearty breakfast, and was\naltogether looking blooming.  When the girls assembled in the\nschool-room for their lessons, Annie brought her little charge down to\nthe large play-room, where they established themselves cosily, and Annie\nbegan to instruct little Nan in the mysteries of--\n\n  \"Tic, tac, too,\n  The little horse has lost his shoe.\"\n\nNan was entering into the spirit of the game, was imagining herself a\nlittle horse, and was holding out her small foot to be shod, when Mrs\nWillis entered the room.\n\n\"Come with me, Nan,\" she said; \"I have got something to show you.\"\n\nNan got up instantly, held out one hand to Mrs Willis and the other to\nAnnie, and said, in her confident baby tones--\n\n\"Me tum; Annie tumming too.\"\n\nMrs Willis said nothing, but, holding the little hand, and accompanied\nby Annie, she went out of the play-room, across the stone hall, and\nthrough the baize doors until she reached her own delightful private\nsitting-room.\n\nThere were heaps of pretty things about, and Nan gazed round her with\nthe appreciative glance of a pleased connoisseur.\n\n\"Pitty 'oom,\" she said approvingly.  \"Nan likes this 'oom.  Me'll stay\nhere, and so will Annie.\"\n\nHere she uttered a sudden cry of rapture--on the floor, with its leaves\ntemptingly open, lay a gayly-painted picture-book, and curled up in a\nsoft fluffy ball by its side was a white Persian kitten asleep.\n\nMrs Willis whispered something to Annie, who ran out of the room, and\nNan knelt down in a perfect rapture of worship by the kitten's side.\n\n\"Pitty tibby pussy!\" she exclaimed several times, and she rubbed it so\npersistently the wrong way that the kitten shivered and stood up, arched\nits beck very high, yawned, turned round three times, and lay down\nagain.  Alas! \"tibby pussy\" was not allowed to have any continuous\nslumber.  Nan dragged the Persian by its tail into her lap, and when it\nresisted this indignity, and with two or three light bounds disappeared\nout of the room, she stretched out her little hands and began to cry for\nit.\n\n\"Turn back, puss, puss--turn back, poor tibby puss--Nan loves 'oo.\nAnnie, go fetch puss for Nan.\"  Then for the first time she discovered\nthat Annie was absent, and that she was alone, with the exception of\nMrs Willis, who sat busily writing at a distant table.\n\nMrs Willis counted for nothing at all with Nan--she did not consider\nher of the smallest importance, and after giving her a quick glance of\nsome disdain she began to trot round the room on a voyage of discovery.\nAny moment Annie would come back--Annie had, indeed, probably gone to\nfetch the kitten, and would quickly return with it.  She walked slowly\nround and round, keeping well away from that part of the room where Mrs\nWillis sat.  Presently she found a very choice little china jug, which\nshe carefully subtracted with her small fingers from a cabinet, which\ncontained many valuable treasures.  She sat down on the floor exactly\nbeneath the cabinet, and began to play with her jug.  She went through\nin eager pantomime a little game which Annie had invented for her, and\nimagined that she was a little milkmaid, and that the jug was full of\nsweet new milk; she called out to an imaginary set of purchasers, \"Want\nany milk?\" and then she floured some by way of drops of milk into the\npalm of her little hand, which she drank up in the name of her customers\nwith considerable gusto.  Presently, knocking the little jug with some\nvehemence on the floor she deprived it with one neat blow of its handle\nand spout.  Mrs Willis was busily writing, and did not look up.  Nan\nwas not in the least disconcerted; she said aloud--\n\n\"Poor tibby zug b'oke,\" and then she left the fragments on the floor,\nand started off on a fresh voyage of discovery.  This time she dragged\ndown a large photographic album on to a cushion, and, kneeling by it,\nbegan to look through the pictures, flapping the pages together with a\nloud noise, and laughing merrily as she did so.  She was now much nearer\nto Mrs Willis, who was attracted by the sound, and looking up hastened\nto the rescue of one of her most precious collections of photographs.\n\n\"Nan, dear,\" she said, \"shut up that book at once.  Nan mustn't touch.\nShut the book, darling, and go and sit on the floor, and look at your\nnice-coloured pictures.\"\n\nNan, still holding a chubby hand between the leaves of the album, gave\nMrs Willis a full defiant glance, and said--\n\n\"Me won't.\"\n\n\"Come, Nan,\" said the head-mistress.\n\n\"Me want Annie,\" said Nan, still kneeling by the album, and, bending her\nhead over the photographs, she turned the page and burst into a peal of\nlaughter.\n\n\"Pitty bow vow,\" she said, pointing to a photograph of a retriever; \"oh,\npitty bow woo, Nan loves 'oo.\"\n\nMrs Willis stooped down and lifted the little girl into her arms.\n\n\"Nan, dear,\" she said, \"it is naughty to disobey.  Sit down by your\npicture-book, and be a good girl.\"\n\n\"Me won't,\" said Nan again, and here she raised her small dimpled hand\nand gave Mrs Willis a smart slap on her cheek.\n\n\"Naughty lady, me don't like 'oo; go 'way.  Nan want Annie--Nan do want\nAnnie.  Me don't love 'oo, naughty lady; go 'way.\"\n\nMrs Willis took Nan on her knee.  She felt that the little will must be\nbent to hers, but the task was no easy one.  The child scarcely knew\nher, she was still weak and excitable, and she presently burst into\nstorms of tears, and sobbed and sobbed as though her little heart would\nbreak, her one cry being for \"Annie, Annie, Annie.\"  When Annie did join\nher in the play hour, the little cheeks were flushed, the white brow\nached, and the child's small hands were hot and feverish.  Mrs Willis\nfelt terribly puzzled.\n\nCHAPTER 26. UNDER THE LAUREL-BUSH.\n\nMrs Willis owned to herself that she was nonplussed; it was quite\nimpossible to allow Annie to neglect her studies, and yet little Nan's\nhealth was still too precarious to allow her to run the risk of having\nthe child constantly fretted.\n\nSuddenly a welcome idea occurred to her; she would write at once to\nNan's old nurse, and see if she could come to Lavender House for the\nremainder of the present term.  Mrs Willis dispatched her letter that\nvery day, and by the following evening the nurse was once more in\npossession of her much-loved little charge.  The habits of her babyhood\nwere too strong for Nan; she returned to them gladly enough, and though\nin her heart of hearts she was still intensely loyal to Annie, she no\nlonger fretted when she was not with her.\n\nAnnie resumed her ordinary work and though Hester was very cold to her,\nseveral of the other girls in the school frankly confided to their\nfavourite how much they had missed her, and how glad they were to have\nher back with them once more.\n\nAnnie found herself at this time in an ever-shifting mood--one moment\nshe longed intensely for a kiss, and a fervent pardon from Mrs Willis's\nlips; another, she said to herself defiantly she could and would live\nwithout it; one moment the hungry and sorrowful look in Hester's eyes\nwent straight to Annie's heart, and she wished she might restore her\nlittle treasure whom she had stolen; the next she rejoiced in her\nstrange power over Nan, and resolved to keep all the love she could get.\n\nIn short, Annie was in that condition when she could be easily\ninfluenced for good or evil--she was in that state of weakness when\ntemptation is least easily resisted.\n\nA few days after the arrival of Nan's nurse Mrs Willis was obliged\nunexpectedly to leave home; a near relative was dangerously ill in\nLondon, and the school-mistress went away in much trouble and anxiety.\nSome of her favourite pupils flocked to the front entrance to see their\nbeloved mistress off.  Amongst the group Cecil stood, and several girls\nof the first-class; many of the little girls were also present, but\nAnnie was not amongst them.  Just at the last moment she rushed up\nbreathlessly; she was tying some starry jasmine and some blue\nforget-me-nots together, and as the carriage was moving off she flung\nthe charming bouquet into her mistress's lap.\n\nMrs Willis rewarded her with one of her old looks of confidence and\nlove; she raised the flowers to her lips and kissed them, and her eyes\nsmiled on Annie.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear,\" she called out; \"good-bye, all my dear girls; I will\ntry and be back to-morrow night.  Remember, my children, during my\nabsence I trust you.\"\n\nThe carriage disappeared down the avenue, and the group of girls melted\naway.  Cecil looked round for Annie, but Annie had been the first to\ndisappear.\n\nWhen her mistress had kissed the flowers and smiled at her, Annie darted\ninto the shrubbery and stood there wiping the fast-falling tears from\nher eyes.  She was interrupted in this occupation by the sudden cries of\ntwo glad and eager voices, and instantly her hands were taken, and some\ngirls rather younger than herself began to drag her in the opposite\ndirection through the shrubbery.\n\n\"Come, Annie--come at once, Annie, darling,\" exclaimed Phyllis and Nora\nRaymond.  \"The basket has come; it's under the thick laurel-tree in the\nback avenue.  We are all waiting for you; we none of us will open it\ntill you arrive.\"\n\nAnnie's face, a truly April one, changed as if by magic.  The tears\ndried on her cheeks; her eyes filled with sunlight; she was all eager\nfor the coming fun.\n\n\"Then we won't lose a moment, Phyllis,\" she said; \"we'll see what that\nduck of a Betty has done for us.\"\n\nThe three girls scampered down the back avenue, where they found five of\ntheir companions, amongst them Susan Drummond, standing in different\nattitudes of expectation near a very large and low-growing laurel-tree.\nEveryone raised a shout when Annie appeared; she was undoubtedly\nrecognised as queen and leader of the proceedings.  She took her post\nwithout an instant's hesitation, and began ordering her willing subjects\nabout.\n\n\"Now, is the coast clear? yes, I think so.  Come, Susie, greedy as you\nare, you must take your part.  You alone of all of us can cackle with\nthe exact imitation of an old hen: get behind that tree at once and\nwatch the yard.  Don't forget to cackle for your life if you even see\nthe shadow of a footfall.  Norah, my pretty birdie, you must be the\nthrush for the nonce; here, lake your post, watch the lawn and the front\navenue.  Now then, girls, the rest of us can see what spoils Betty has\nprovided for us.\"\n\nThe basket was dragged from its hiding-place, and longing faces peered\neagerly and greedily into its contents.\n\n\"On, oh!  I say, cherries! and what a lot!  Good Betty! dear, darling\nBetty! you gathered those from your own trees, and they are as ripe as\nyour apple-blossom cheeks!  Now then, what next?  I do declare,\nmeringues!  Betty knew my weakness.  Twelve meringues--that is one and a\nhalf apiece; Susan Drummond sha'n't have more than her share.  Meringues\nand cheesecakes and--tartlets--oh! oh! what a duck Betty is!  A\nplum-cake--good, excellent Betty, she deserves to be canonised!  What\nhave we here?  Roast chickens--better and better!  What is in this\nparcel?  Slices of ham; Betty knew she dare not show her face again if\nshe forgot the ham.  Knives and forks, spoons--fresh rolls--salt and\npepper, and a dozen bottles of ginger-beer, and a little corkscrew in\ncase we want it.\"\n\nThese various exclamations came from many lips.  The contents of the\nbasket were carefully and tenderly replaced, the lid was fastened down,\nand it was once more consigned to its hiding-place under the thick\nboughs of the laurel.\n\nNot a moment too soon, for just at this instant Susan cackled fiercely,\nand the little group withdrew, Annie first whispering--\n\n\"At twelve to-night, then, girls--oh, yes, I have managed the key.\"\n\nCHAPTER 27. TRUANTS.\n\nIt was a proverbial saying in the school that Annie Forest was always in\nhot water; she was exceedingly daring, and loved what she called a spice\nof danger.  This was not the first stolen picnic at which Annie reigned\nas queen, but this was the largest she had yet organised, and this was\nthe first time she had dared to go out of doors with her satellites.\n\nHitherto these naughty sprites had been content to carry their baskets\nfull of artfully-concealed provisions to a disused attic which was\nexactly over the box-room, and consequently out of reach of the\ninhabited part of the house.  Here, making a table of a great chest\nwhich stood in the attic, they feasted gloriously, undisturbed by the\nmusty smell or by the innumerable spiders and beetles which disappeared\nrapidly in all directions at their approach; but when Annie one day\nincautiously suggested that on summer nights the outside world was all\nat their disposal, they began to discover flaws in their\nbanqueting-hall.  Mary Price said the musty smell made her half sick;\nPhyllis declared that at the sight of a spider she invariably turned\nfaint; and Susan Drummond was heard to murmur that in a dusty, fusty\nattic even meringues scarcely kept her awake.  The girls were all wild\nto try a midnight picnic out of doors, and Annie in her present mood,\nwas only too eager for the fun.\n\nWith her usual skill she organised the whole undertaking, and eight\nagitated, slightly frightened, but much excited girls retired to their\nrooms that night.  Annie, in her heart of hearts, felt rather sorry that\nMrs Willis should happen to be away; dim ideas of honour and\ntrustworthiness were still stirring in her breast, but she dared not\nthink now.\n\nThe night was in every respect propitious; the moon would not rise until\nafter twelve, so the little party could get away under the friendly\nshelter of the darkness, and soon afterwards have plenty of light to\nenjoy their stolen feast.  They had arranged to make no movement until\nclose on midnight, and then they were all to meet in a passage which\nbelonged to the kitchen regions, and where there was a side door which\nopened directly into the shrubbery.  This door was not very often\nunlocked, and Annie had taken the key from its place in the lock some\ndays before.  She went to bed with her companions at nine o'clock as\nusual, and presently fell into an uneasy doze.  She awoke to hear the\ngreat clock in the hall strike eleven and a few minutes afterwards she\nheard Miss Danesbury's footsteps retiring to her room at the other end\nof the passage.\n\n\"Danesbury is always the last to go to bed,\" whispered Annie to herself;\n\"I can get up presently.\"\n\nShe lay for another twenty minutes, then, softly rising, began to put on\nher clothes in the dark.  Over her dress she fastened her waterproof,\nand placed a close-fitting brown velvet cap on her curly head.  Having\ndressed herself, she approached Susan's bed with the intention of\nrousing her.\n\n\"I shall have fine work now,\" she said, \"and shall probably have to\nresort to cold water.  Really, if Susy proves too hard to wake, I shall\nlet her sleep on--her drowsiness is past bearing.\"\n\nAnnie, however, was considerably startled when she discovered that Miss\nDrummond's bed was without an occupant.\n\nAt this moment the room door was very softly opened, and Susan, fully\ndressed and in her waterproof, came in.\n\n\"Why, Susy, where have you been?\" exclaimed Annie.  \"Fancy you being\nawake a moment before it is necessary!\"\n\n\"For once in a way I was restless,\" replied Miss Drummond, \"so I thought\nI would get up, and take a turn in the passage outside.  The house is\nperfectly quiet, and we can come now; most of the girls are already\nwaiting at the side door.\"\n\nHolding their shoes in their hands, Annie and Susan went noiselessly\ndown the carpetless stairs, and found the remaining six girls waiting\nfor them by the side door.\n\n\"Rover is our one last danger now,\" said Annie, as she fitted the\nwell-oiled key into the lock.  \"Put on your shoes, girls, and let me out\nfirst; I think I can manage him.\"\n\nShe was alluding to a great mastiff which was usually kept chained up by\nday.  Phyllis and Norah laid their hands on her arm.\n\n\"Oh, Annie, oh, love, suppose he seizes on you, and knocks you down--oh,\ndare you venture?\"\n\n\"Let me go,\" said Annie a little contemptuously; \"you don't suppose I am\nafraid?\"\n\nHer fingers trembled, for her nerves were highly strung; but she managed\nto unlock the door and draw back the bolts, and, opening it softly, she\nwent out into the silent night.\n\nVery slight as the noise she made was, it had aroused the watchful\nRover, who trotted around swiftly to know what was the matter.  But\nAnnie had made friends with Rover long ago by stealing to his kennel\ndoor and feeding him, and she had now but to say \"Rover\" in her\nmelodious voice, and throw her arms around his neck, to completely\nsubvert his morals.\n\n\"He is one of us, girls,\" she called in a whisper to her companions;\n\"come out.  Rover will be as naughty as the rest of us, and go with us\nas our bodyguard to the fairies' field.  Now, I will lock the door on\nthe outside, and we can be off.  Ah, the moon is getting up splendidly,\nand when we have secured Betty's basket, we shall be quite out of reach\nof danger.\"\n\nAt Annie's words of encouragement the seven girls ventured out.  She\nlocked the door, put the key into her pocket, and, holding Rover by his\ncollar; led the way in the direction of the laurel-bush.  The basket was\nsecured, and Susan, to her disgust, and Mary Morris were elected for the\nfirst part of the way to carry it.  The young truants then walked\nquickly down the avenue until they came to a turn-stile which led into a\nwood.\n\nCHAPTER 28. IN THE FAIRIES' FIELD.\n\nThe moon had now come up brilliantly, and the little party were in the\nhighest possible spirits.  They had got safely away from the house, and\nthere was now, comparatively speaking, little fear of discovery.  The\nmore timid ones, who ventured to confess that their hearts were in their\nmouths while Annie was unlocking the side door, now became the most\nexcited, and perhaps the boldest, under the reaction, which set in.\nEven the wood, which was comparatively dark, with only patches of\nmoonlight here and there, and queer weird shadows where the trees were\nthinnest, could not affect their spirits.\n\nThe poor, sleepy rabbits must have been astonished that night at the\nshouts of the revellers, as they hurried past them, and the birds must\nhave taken their sleepy heads from under their downy wings, and wondered\nif the morning had come some hours before its usual time.\n\nMore than one solemn old owl blinked at them, and hooted as they passed,\nand told them in owl language what silly, naughty young things they\nwere, and how they would repent of this dissipation by-and-by.  But if\nthe girls were to have an hour of remorse, it did not visit them then;\ntheir hearts were like feathers, and by the time they reached the fields\nwhere the fairies were supposed to play their spirits had become almost\nuncontrollable.\n\nLuckily for them this small green field lay in a secluded hollow, and\nmore luckily for them no tramps were about to hear their merriment.\nRover, who constituted himself Annie's protector, now lay down by her\nside, and as she was the real ringleader and queen of the occasion, she\nordered her subjects about pretty sharply.\n\n\"Now, girls, quick; open the basket.  Yes, I'm going to rest.  I have\norganised the whole thing, and I'm fairly tired; so I'll just sit\nquietly here, and Rover will take care of me while you set things\nstraight.  Ah! good Betty; she did not even forget the white\ntable-cloth.\"\n\nHere one of the girls remarked casually that the grass was wet with dew,\nand that it was well they had all put on their waterproofs.\n\nAnnie interrupted again in a petulant voice--\n\n\"Don't croak, Mary Morris.  Out with the chickens, lay the ham in this\ncorner, and the cherries will make a picturesque pile in the middle.\nTwelve meringues in all, that means a meringue and a half each.  We\nshall have some difficulty in dividing.  Oh, dear! oh, dear! how hungry\nI am!  I was far too excited to eat anything at supper-time.\"\n\n\"So was I,\" said Phyllis, coming up and pressing close to Annie.  \"I do\nthink Miss Danesbury cuts the bread and butter too thick--don't you,\nAnnie?  I could not eat mine at all, to-night, and Cecil Temple asked me\nif I was not well.\"\n\n\"Those who don't want chicken hold up their hands,\" here interrupted\nAnnie, who had tossed her brown cap on the grass, and between whose\nbrows a faint frown had passed for an instant at the mention of Cecil's\nname.\n\nThe feast now began in earnest, and silence reigned for a short time,\nbroken only by the clatter of plates, and such an occasional remark as\n\"Pass the salt, please,\" \"Pepper this way, if you've no objection,\" \"How\ngood chicken tastes in fairy-land,\" etc.  At last the ginger-beer\nbottles began to pop--the girl's first hunger was appeased.  Rover\ngladly crunched up all the bones, and conversation flowed once more,\naccompanied by the delicate diversion of taking alternate bites at\nmeringues and cheesecakes.\n\n\"I wish the fairies would come out,\" said Annie.\n\n\"Oh, don't!\" shivered Phyllis, looking round her nervously.\n\n\"Annie, darling, do tell us a ghost story,\" cried several voices.\n\nAnnie laughed, and commenced a series of nonsense tales, all of a\nslightly eerie character, which she made up on the spot.\n\nThe moon riding high in the heavens looked down on the young giddy\nheads, and their laughter, naughty as they were, sounded sweet in the\nnight air.\n\nTime flew quickly, and the girls suddenly discovered that they must pack\nup their table-cloth and remove all traces of the feast unless they\nwished the bright light of morning to discover them.  They rose hastily,\nsighing, and slightly depressed now that their fun was over.  The white\ntable-cloth, no longer very white, was packed into the basket, the\nginger-beer bottles placed on top of it, and the lid fastened down.  Not\na crumb of the feast remained; Rover had demolished the bones, and the\neight girls had made short work of everything else, with the exception\nof the cherry-stones, which Phyllis carefully collected and popped into\na little hole in the ground.\n\nThe party then progressed slowly homewards, and once more entered the\ndark wood.  They were much more silent now; the wood was darker, and the\nchill which foretells the dawn was making itself felt in the air.\nEither the sense of cold, or a certain effect produced by Annie's\nridiculous stories, made many of the little party unduly nervous.\n\nThey had only taken a few steps through the wood when Phyllis suddenly\nuttered a piercing shriek.  This shriek was echoed by Nora and by Mary\nMorris, and all their hearts seemed to leap into their mouths when they\nsaw something move among the trees.  Rover uttered a growl, and, but for\nAnnie's detaining hand, would have sprung forward.  The high-spirited\ngirl was not to be easily daunted.\n\n\"Behold, girls, the goblin of the woods,\" she exclaimed.  \"Quiet, Rover;\nstand still.\"\n\nThe next instant the fears of the little party reached their culmination\nwhen a tall, dark figure stood directly in their paths.\n\n\"If you don't let us pass at once,\" said Annie's voice, \"I'll set Rover\nat you.\"\n\nThe dog began to bark loudly, and quivered from head to foot.\n\nThe figure moved a little to one side, and a rather deep and slightly\ndramatic voice said--\n\n\"I mean you no harm, young ladies; I'm only a gypsy-mother from the\ntents yonder.  You are welcome to get back to Lavender House.  I have\nthen one course plain before me.\"\n\n\"Come on, girls,\" said Annie, now considerably frightened, while\nPhyllis, and Nora, and one or two more began to sob.\n\n\"Look here, young ladies,\" said the gypsy in a whining voice, \"I don't\nmean you no harm, my pretties, and it's no affair of mine telling the\ngood ladies at Lavender House what I've seen.  You cross my hand, dears,\neach of you, with a bit of silver, and all I'll do is to tell your\npretty fortunes, and mum is the word with the gypsy-mother as far as\nthis night's prank is concerned.\"\n\n\"We had better do it, Annie--we had better do it,\" here sobbed Phyllis.\n\"If this was found out by Mrs Willis we might be expelled--we might,\nindeed; and that horrid woman is sure to tell of us--I know she is.\"\n\n\"Quite sure to tell, dear,\" said the tall gypsy, dropping a curtsey in a\nmanner which looked frightfully sarcastic in the long shadows made by\nthe trees.  \"Quite sure to tell, and to be expelled is the very least\nthat could happen to such naughty little ladies.  Here's a nice little\nbit of clearing in the wood, and we'll all come over, and Mother Rachel\nwill tell your fortunes in a twinkling, and no one will be the wiser.\nSixpence apiece, my dears--only sixpence apiece.\"\n\n\"Oh, come; do, do come,\" said Nora, and the next moment they were all\nstanding in a circle round Mother Rachel, who pocketed her black-mail\neagerly, and repeated some gibberish over each little hand.  Over\nAnnie's palm she lingered for a brief moment, and looked with her\npenetrating eyes into the girl's face.\n\n\"You'll have suffering before you, miss; some suspicion, and danger even\nto life itself.  But you'll triumph, my dear, you'll triumph.  You're a\nplucky one, and you'll do a brave deed.  There--good-night, young\nladies; you have nothing more to fear from Mother Rachel.\"\n\nThe tall dark figure disappeared into the blackest shadows of the wood,\nand the girls, now like so many frightened hares, flew home.  They\ndeposited their basket where Betty would find it, under the shadow of\nthe great laurel in the back avenue.  They all bade Rover an\naffectionate \"good-night.\"  Annie softly unlocked the side door, and one\nby one, with their shoes in their hands, they regained their bedrooms.\nThey were all very tired, and very cold, and a dull fear and sense of\ninsecurity rested over each little heart.  Suppose Mother Rachel proved\nunfaithful, notwithstanding the sixpences?\n\nCHAPTER 29. HESTER'S FORGOTTEN BOOK.\n\nIt wanted scarcely three weeks to the holidays, and therefore scarcely\nthree weeks to that auspicious day when Lavender House was to be the\nscene of one long triumph, and was to be the happy spot selected for a\nMidsummer holiday, accompanied by all that could make a holiday\nperfect--for youth and health would be there, and even the unsuccessful\ncompetitors for the great prizes would not have too sore hearts, for\nthey would know that on the next day they were going home.  Each girl\nwho had done her best would have a word of commendation, and only those\nwho were very naughty, or very stubborn, could resist the all-potent\nelixir of happiness which would be poured out so abundantly for Mrs\nWillis's pupils on this day.\n\nNow that the time was drawing so near, those girls who were working for\nprizes found themselves fully occupied from morning to night.  In\nplay-hours even, girls would be seen with their heads bent over their\nbooks, and, between the prizes and the acting, no little bees in any\nhive could be more constantly employed than were these young girls just\nnow.\n\nNo happiness is, after all, to be compared to the happiness of healthful\noccupation.  Busy people have no time to fret and no time to grumble.\nAccording to our old friend, Dr Watts, people who are healthily busy\nhave also no time to be naughty, for the old doctor says that it is for\nidle hands that mischief is prepared.\n\nBe that as it may, and there is great truth in it, some naughty sprites,\nsome bad fairies, were flitting around and about that apparently\npeaceful atmosphere.  That sunny home, governed by all that was sweet\nand good, was not without its serpent.\n\nOf all the prizes which attracted interest and aroused competition, the\nprize for English composition was this year the most popular.  In the\nfirst place, this was known to be Mrs Willis's own favourite subject.\nShe had a great wish that her girls should write intelligibly--she had a\ngreater wish that, if possible, they should think.\n\n\"Never was there so much written and printed,\" she was often heard to\nsay; \"but can anyone show me a book with thoughts in it?  Can anyone\nshow me, unless as a rare exception, a book which will live?  Oh, yes,\nthese books which issue from the press in thousands are, many of them,\nvery smart, a great many of them clever, but they are thrown off too\nquickly.  All great things, great books amongst them, must be evolved\nslowly.\"\n\nThen she would tell her pupils what she considered the reason of this.\n\n\"In these days,\" she would say, \"all girls are what is called highly\neducated.  Girls and boys alike must go in for competitive examinations,\nmust take out diplomas, and must pass certain standards of excellence.\nThe system is cramming from beginning to end.  There is no time for\nreflection.  In short, my dear girls, you swallow a great deal, but you\ndo not digest your intellectual food.\"\n\nMrs Willis hailed with pleasure any little dawnings of real thought in\nher girls' prize essays.  More than once she bestowed the prize upon the\nessay which seemed to the girls the most crude and unfinished.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she would say, \"here is an idea--or at least half an idea.\nThis little bit of composition is original, and not, at best, a poor\nimitation of Sir Walter Scott or Lord Macaulay.\"\n\nThus the girls found a strong stimulus to be their real selves in these\nlittle essays, and the best of them chose their subject and let it\nferment in their brains without the aid of books, except for the more\ntechnical parts.\n\nMore than one girl in the school was surprised at Dora Russell exerting\nherself to try for the prize essay.  She was just about to close her\nschool career, and they could not make out why she roused herself to\nwork for the most difficult prize, for which she would have to compete\nwith any girl in the school who chose to make a similar attempt.\n\nDora, however, had her own, not very high motive for making the attempt.\nShe was a thoroughly accomplished girl, graceful in her appearance and\nmanner; in short, just the sort of girl who would be supposed to do\ncredit to a school.  She played with finish, and even delicacy of touch.\nThere was certainly no soul in her music, but neither were there any\nwrong notes.  Her drawings were equally correct, her perspective good,\nher trees were real trees, and the colouring of her water-colour\nsketches was pure.  She spoke French extremely well, and with a correct\naccent, and her German also was above the average.  Nevertheless, Dora\nwas commonplace, and those girls who knew her best spoke sarcastically,\nand smiled at one another when she alluded to her prize essay, and\nseemed confident of being the successful competitor.\n\n\"You won't like to be beaten, Dora, say, by Annie Forest,\" they would\nlaughingly remark; whereupon Dora's calm face would slightly flush and\nher lips would assume a very proud curve.  If there was one thing she\ncould not bear it was to be beaten.\n\n\"Why do you try for it, Dora?\" her class-fellows would ask; but here\nDora made no reply: she kept her reason to herself.\n\nThe fact was Dora, who must be a copyist to the end of the chapter, and\nwho could never to her latest day do anything original, had determined\nto try for the composition prize because she happened accidentally to\nhear a conversation between Mrs Willis and Miss Danesbury, in which\nsomething was said about a gold locket with Mrs Willis's portrait\ninside.\n\nDora instantly jumped at the conclusion that this was to be the great\nprize bestowed upon the successful essayist.  Delightful idea; how well\nthe trinket would look round her smooth white throat!  Instantly she\ndetermined to try for this prize, and of course as instantly the bare\nidea of defeat became intolerable to her.  She went steadily and\nmethodically to work.  With extreme care she chose her subject.  Knowing\nsomething of Mrs Willis's peculiarities, she determined that her theme\nshould not be historical; she believed that she could express herself\nfreely and with power if only she could secure an un-hackneyed subject.\nSuddenly an idea which she considered brilliant occurred to her.  She\nwould call her composition \"The River.\"  This should not bear reference\nto Father Thames, or any other special river of England, but it should\ntrace the windings of some fabled stream of Dora's imagination, which,\nas it flowed along, should tell something of the story of the many\nplaces by which it passed.  Dora was charmed with her own thought, and\nworked hard, evening after evening, at her subject, covering sheets of\nmanuscript paper with pencilled jottings, and arranging and rearranging\nher somewhat confused thoughts.  She greatly admired a perfectly rounded\nperiod, and she was most particular as to the style in which she wrote.\nFor the purpose of improving her style she even studied old volumes of\nAddison's _Spectator_; but after a time she gave up this course of\nstudy, for she found it so difficult to mould her English to Addison's\nthat she came to the comfortable conclusion that Addison was decidedly\nobsolete, and that if she wished to do full justice to \"The River\" she\nmust trust to her own unaided genius.\n\nAt last the first ten pages were written.  The subject was entered upon\nwith considerable flourishes, and some rather apt poetical quotations\nfrom a book containing a collection of poems; the river itself had\nalready left its home in the mountain, and was careering merrily past\nsunny meadows and little rural, impossible cottages, where the\ngolden-haired children played.\n\nDora made a very neat copy of her essay so far.  She now began to see\nher way clearly--there would be a very powerful passage as the river\napproached the murky town.  Here, indeed, would be room for powerful and\npathetic writing.  She wondered if she might venture so far as to hide a\nsuicide in her rushing waters; and then at last the brawling river would\nlose itself in the sea; and, of course, there would not be the smallest\nconnection between her river, and Kingsley's well-known song, \"Clear and\ncool.\"\n\nShe finished writing her ten pages, and being now positively certain of\nher gold locket, went to bed in a happy state of mind.\n\nThis was the very night when Annie was to lead her revellers through the\ndark wood, but Dora, who never troubled herself about the younger\nclasses, would have been certainly the last to notice the fact that a\nfew of the girls in Lavender House seemed little disposed to eat their\nsuppers of thick bread-and-butter and milk.  She went to bed and dreamt\nhappy dreams about her golden locket, and had little idea that any\nmischief was about to be performed.\n\nHester Thornton also, but in a very different spirit, was working hard\nat her essay.  Hester worked conscientiously; she had chosen \"Marie\nAntoinette\" as her theme, and she read the sorrowful story of the\nbeautiful queen with intense interest, and tried hard to get herself\ninto the spirit of the times about which she must write.  She had\nscarcely begun her essay yet, but she had already collected most of the\nhistorical facts.\n\nHester was a very careful little student, and as she prepared herself\nfor the great work.  She thought little or nothing about the prize; she\nonly wanted to do justice to the unfortunate Queen of France.  She was\nin bed that night, and just dropping off to sleep, when she suddenly\nremembered that she had left a volume of French poetry on her\nschool-desk.  This was against the rules, and she knew that Miss\nDanesbury would confiscate the book in the morning, and would not let\nher have it back for a week.  Hester particularly wanted this special\nbook just now, as some of the verses bore reference to her subject, and\nshe could scarcely get on with her essay without having it to refer to\nShe must lose no time in instantly beginning to write her essay, and to\ndo without her book of poetry for a week would be a serious injury to\nher.\n\nShe resolved, therefore, to break through one of the rules, and, after\nlying awake until the whole house was quiet, to slip downstairs, enter\nthe school-room and secure her poems.  She heard the clock strike\neleven, and she knew that in a very few moments Miss Danesbury and Miss\nGood would have retired to their rooms.  Ah, yes, that was Miss\nDanesbury's step passing her door.  Ten minutes later she glided out of\nbed, slipped on her dressing-gown, and opening her door, ran swiftly\ndown the carpetless stairs, and found herself in the great stone hall\nwhich led to the school-room.\n\nShe was surprised to find the school-room door a little ajar, but she\nentered the room without hesitation, and, dark as it was, soon found her\ndesk, and the book of poems lying on the top.  Hester was about to\nreturn when she was startled by a little noise in that portion of the\nroom where the first-class girls sat.  The next moment somebody came\nheavily and rather clumsily down the room, and the moon which was just\nbeginning to rise fell for an instant on a girl's face.  Hester\nrecognised the face of Susan Drummond.  What could she be doing here?\nShe did not dare to speak, for she herself had broken a rule in visiting\nthe school-room.  She remained, therefore, perfectly still until Susan's\nsteps died away, and then, thankful to have secured her own property,\nreturned to her bedroom, and a moment or two later was sound asleep.\n\nCHAPTER 30. \"A MUDDY STREAM.\"\n\nIn the morning Dora Russell sat down as usual before her orderly and\nneatly-kept desk.  She raised the lid to find everything in its place--\nher books and exercises all as they should be, and her pet essay in a\nneat brown-paper cover, lying just as she had left it the night before.\nShe was really getting quite excited about her river, and as this was a\nhalf-holiday, she determined to have a good work at it in the afternoon.\nShe was beginning also to experience that longing for an auditor which\noccasionally is known to trouble the breasts of genius.  She felt that\nthose graceful ideas, that elegant language, those measured periods,\nmight strike happily on some other ears before they were read aloud as\nthe great work of the Midsummer holidays.\n\nShe knew that Hester Thornton was making what she was pleased to term a\npoor little attempt at trying for the same prize.  Hester would scarcely\nventure to copy anything from Dora's essay; she would probably be\ndiscouraged, poor girl, in working any longer at her own composition;\nbut Dora felt that the temptation to read \"The River,\" as far as it had\ngone, to Hester was really too great to be resisted.  Accordingly, after\ndinner she graciously invited Hester to accompany her to a bower in the\ngarden, where the two friends might revel over the results of Dora's\nextraordinary talents.\n\nHester was still, to a certain extent, under Dora's influence, and had\nnot the courage to tell her that she intended to be very busy over her\nown essay this afternoon.\n\n\"Now, Hester, dear,\" said Dora, when they found themselves both seated\nin the bower, \"you are the only girl in the school to whom I could\nconfide the subject of my great essay.  I really believe that I have hit\non something absolutely original.  My dear child, I hope you won't allow\nyourself to be discouraged.  I fear that you won't have much heart to go\non with your theme after you have read my words; but, never mind, dear,\nit will be good practice for you, and you know it _was_ rather silly to\ngo in for a prize which I intended to compete for.\"\n\n\"May I read your essay, please, Dora?\" asked Hester.  \"I am very much\ninterested in my own study, and, whether I win the prize or not, I shall\nalways remember the pleasure I took in writing it.\"\n\n\"What subject did you select, dear?\" inquired Miss Russell.\n\n\"Well, I am attempting a little sketch of Marie Antoinette.\"\n\n\"Ah, hackneyed, my dear girl--terribly hackneyed; but, of course, I\ndon't mean to discourage you.  _Now_!--I draw a life--picture, and I\ncall it `The River.'  See how it begins--why, I declare I know the words\nby heart, `_As our eyes rest on this clear and limpid stream, as we see\nthe sun sparkle_.'  My dear Hester, you shall read me my essay aloud.  I\nshall like to hear my own words from your lips, and you have really a\npretty accent, dear.\"\n\nHester folded back the brown-paper cover, and wanting to have her task\nover began to read nastily.  But, as her eyes rested on the first lines,\nshe turned to her companion, and said--\n\n\"Did you not tell me that your essay was called `The River'?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear; the full title is `The Windings of a Noble River.'\"\n\n\"That's very odd,\" replied Hester.  \"What I see here is `The Meanderings\nof a Muddy Stream.' `_As our dull orbs rest on this turbid water on\nwhich the sun cannot possibly shine_.'  Why, Dora, this cannot be your\nessay, and yet, surely, it is your handwriting.\"\n\nDora, with her face suddenly flushing a vivid crimson, snatched the\nmanuscript from Hester's hand, and looked over it eagerly.  Alas! there\nwas no doubt.  The title of this essay was \"The Meanderings of a Muddy\nStream,\" and the words which immediately followed were a smart and\nridiculous parody on her own high-flown sentences.  The resemblance to\nher handwriting was perfect.  The brown-paper cover, neatly sewn on to\nprotect the white manuscript, was undoubtedly her cover; the very paper\non which the words were written seemed in all particulars the same.\nDora turned the sheets eagerly, and here for the first time she saw a\ndifference.  Only four or five pages of the nonsense essay had been\nattempted, and the night before, when finishing her toil, she had\nproudly numbered her tenth page.  She looked through the whole thing,\nturning leaf after leaf, while her cheeks were crimson, and her hands\ntrembled.  In the first moment of horrible humiliation and dismay she\nliterally could not speak.\n\nAt last, springing to her feet, and confronting the astonished and\nalmost frightened Hester, she found her voice.\n\n\"Hester, you must help me in this.  The most dreadful, the most\natrocious fraud has been committed.  Some one has been base enough,\naudacious enough, wicked enough, to go to my desk privately, and take\naway my real essay--my work over which I have laboured and toiled.  The\nexpressions of my--my--yes, I will say it--my genius, have been\nruthlessly burnt, or otherwise made away with, and _this_ thing has been\nput in their place.  Hester, why don't you speak--why do you stare at me\nlike this?\"\n\n\"I am puzzled by the writing,\" said Hester; \"the writing is yours.\"\n\n\"The writing is mine!--oh, you wicked girl!  The writing is an imitation\nof mine--a feeble and poor imitation.  I thought, Hester, that by this\ntime you knew your friend's handwriting.  I thought that one in whom I\nhave confided--one whom I have stooped to notice because I fancied we\nhad a community of soul, would not be so ridiculous and so silly as to\nmistake this writing for mine.  Look again, please, Hester Thornton, and\ntell me if I am ever so vulgar as to cross my _t's_.  You know I\n_always_ loop them; and do I make a capital B in this fashion?  And do I\nindulge in flourishes?  I grant you that the general effect to a casual\nobserver would be something the same, but you, Hester--I thought you\nknew me better.\"\n\nHere Hester, examining the false essay, had to confess that the crossed\n_t's_ and the flourishes were unlike Miss Russell's calligraphy.\n\n\"It is a forgery, most cleverly done,\" said Dora.  \"There is such a\nthing, Hester, as being wickedly clever.  This spiteful, cruel attempt\nto injure another can have but proceeded from one _very_ low order of\nmind.  Hester, there has been plenty of favouritism in this school, but\ndo you suppose I shall allow such a thing as this to pass over\nunsearched into?  If necessary, I shall ask my father to interfere.\nThis is a slight--an outrage; but the whole mystery shall at last be\ncleared up.  Miss Good and Miss Danesbury shall be informed at once, and\nthe very instant Mrs Willis returns she shall be told what a serpent\nshe has been nursing in this false, wicked girl, Annie Forest.\"\n\n\"Stop, Dora,\" said Hester suddenly.  She sprang to her feet, clasping\nher hands, and her colour varied rapidly from white to red.  A sudden\nlight poured in upon her, and she was about to speak when something--\nquite a small, trivial thing--occurred.  She only saw little Nan in the\ndistance flying swiftly, with outstretched arms, to meet a girl, whose\nknees she clasped in baby ecstasy.  The girl stooped down and kissed the\nlittle face, and the round arms were flung around her neck.  The next\ninstant Annie Forest continued her walk alone, and Nan, looking\nwistfully back after her, went in another direction with her nurse.  The\nwhole scene took but a moment to enact, but as she watched, Hester's\nface grew hard and white.  She sat down again, with her lips firmly\npressed together.\n\n\"What is it, Hester?\" exclaimed Dora.  \"What were you going to say?  You\nsurely know nothing about this?\"\n\n\"Well, Dora, I am not the guilty person.  I was only going to remark\nthat you cannot be _sure_ it is Annie Forest.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you are going to take that horrid girl's part now?  I wonder at\nyou!  She all but killed your little sister, and then stole her love\naway from you.  Did you see the little thing now, how she flew to her?\nWhy, she never kisses you like that.\"\n\n\"I know--I know,\" said Hester, and she turned away her face with a\ngroan, and leant forward against the rustic bench, pressing her hot\nforehead down on her hands.\n\n\"You'll have your triumph, Hester, when Miss Forest is publicly\nexpelled,\" said Dora, tapping her lightly on the shoulder, and then,\ntaking up the forged essay, she went slowly out of the garden.\n\nCHAPTER 31. GOOD AND BAD ANGELS.\n\nHester stayed behind in the shady little arbour, and then, on that soft\nspring day, while the birds sang overhead, and the warm light breezes\ncame in and fanned her hot cheeks, good angels and bad drew near to\nfight for a victory.  Which would conquer?  Hester had many faults, but\nhitherto she had been honourable and truthful; her sins had been those\nof pride and jealousy, but she had never told a falsehood in her life.\nShe, knew perfectly--she trembled as the full knowledge overpowered\nher--that she had it in her power to exonerate Annie.  She could not in\nthe least imagine now stupid Susan Drummond could contrive and carry out\nsuch a clever and deep-laid plot; but she knew also that if she related\nwhat she had seen with her own eyes the night before, she would probably\ngive such a clew to the apparent mystery that the truth would come to\nlight.\n\nIf Annie was cleared from this accusation, doubtless the old story of\nher supposed guilt with regard to Mrs Willis's caricature would also be\nread with its right key.  Hester was a clever and sharp girl; and the\nfact of seeing Susan Drummond in the school-room in the dead of night\nopened her eyes also to one or two other apparent little mysteries.\nWhile Susan was her own room-mate she had often given a passing wonder\nto the fact of her extraordinary desire to overcome her sleepiness, and\nhad laughed over the expedients Susan had used to wake at all moments.\n\nThese things, at the time, had scarcely given her a moment's serious\nreflection; but now she pondered them carefully, and became more and\nmore certain that, for some inexplicable and unfathomable reason,\nsleepy, and apparently innocent, Susan Drummond wished to sow the seeds\nof mischief and discord in the school.  Hester was sure that if she\nchose to speak now she could clear poor Annie, and restore her to her\nlost place in Mrs Willis's favour.\n\nShould she do so?--ah! should she?  Her lips trembled, her colour came\nand went as the angels, good and bad, fought hard for victory within\nher.  How she had longed to revenge herself on Annie!  How cordially she\nhad hated her!  Now was the moment of her revenge.  She had but to\nremain silent now, and to let matters take their course; she had but to\nhold her tongue about the little incident of last night, and, without\nany doubt, circumstantial evidence would point at Annie Forest, and she\nwould be expelled from the school.  Mrs Willis must condemn her now.\nMr Everard must pronounce her guilty now.  She would go, and when the\ncoast was again clear the love which she had taken from Hester--the\nprecious love of Hester's only little sister--would return.\n\n\"You will be miserable: you will be miserable,\" whispered the good\nangels sorrowfully in her ear; but she did not listen to them.\n\n\"I said I would revenge myself, and this is my opportunity,\" she\nmurmured.  \"Silence--just simply silence--will be my revenge.\"\n\nThen the good angels went sorrowfully back to their Father in heaven,\nand the wicked angels rejoiced.  Hester had fallen very low.\n\nCHAPTER 32. FRESH SUSPICIONS.\n\nMrs Willis was not at home many hours before Dora Russell begged for an\ninterview with her.  Annie had not as yet heard anything of the changed\nessay; for Dora had resolved to keep the thing a secret until Mrs\nWillis herself took the matter in hand.\n\nAnnie was feeling not a little anxious and depressed.  She was sorry now\nthat she had led the girls that wild escapade through the wood.  Phyllis\nand Nora were both suffering from heavy colds in consequence, and Susan\nDrummond was looking more pasty about her complexion, and was more\ndismally sleepy than usual.  Annie was going through her usual season of\nintense remorse after one of her wild pranks.  No one repented with more\napparent fervour than she did, and yet no one so easily succumbed to the\nnext temptation.  Had Annie been alone in the matter she would have gone\nstraight to Mrs Willis and confessed all; but she could not do this\nwithout implicating her companions, who would have screamed with horror\nat the very suggestion.\n\nAll the girls were more or less depressed by the knowledge that the\ngypsy woman, Mother Rachel, shared their secret; and they often\nwhispered together as to the chances of her betraying them.  Old Betty\nthey could trust; for Betty, the cake-woman, had been an\narch-conspirator with the naughty girls of Lavender House from time\nimmemorial.  Betty had always managed to provide their stolen suppers\nfor them, and had been most accommodating in the matter of pay.  Yes,\nwith Betty they felt they were safe; but Mother Rachel was a different\nperson.  She might like to be paid a few more sixpences for her silence;\nshe might hover about the grounds; she might be noticed.  At any moment\nshe might boldly demand an interview with Mrs Willis.\n\n\"I'm awfully afraid of Mother Rachel,\" Phyllis moaned, as she shivered\nunder the influence of her bad cold.\n\nNora said \"I should faint if I saw her again, I know I should while the\nother girls always went out provided with stray sixpences, in case the\ngypsy-mother should start up from some unexpected quarter and demand\nblack-mail.\"\n\nOn the day of Mrs Willis's return, Annie was pacing up and down the\nshady walk, and indulging in some rather melancholy and regretful\nthoughts, when Susan Drummond and Mary Morris rushed up to her, white\nwith terror.\n\n\"She's down there by the copse, and she's beckoning to us!  Oh, do come\nwith us--do, darling, dear Annie.\"\n\n\"There's no use in it,\" replied Annie; \"Mother Rachel wants money, and I\nam not going to give her any.  Don't be afraid of her, girls, and don't\ngive her money.  After all, why should she tell on us? she would gain\nnothing by doing so.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, she would, Annie--she would, Annie,\" said Mary Morris,\nbeginning to sob; \"oh, do come with us, do!  We must pacify her, we\nreally must.\"\n\n\"I can't come now,\" said Annie; \"hark! some one is calling me.  Yes,\nMiss Danesbury--what is it?\"\n\n\"Mrs Willis wishes to see you at once, Annie, in her private\nsitting-room,\" replied Miss Danesbury; and Annie, wondering not a\nlittle, but quite unsuspicious, ran off.\n\nThe fact, however, of her having deliberately disobeyed Mrs Willis, and\ndone something which she knew would greatly pain her, brought a shade of\nembarrassment to her usually candid face.  She had also to confess to\nherself that she did not feel quite so comfortable about Mother Rachel\nas she had given Mary Morris and Susan Drummond to understand.  Her\nsteps lagged more and more as she approached the house, and she wished,\noh, how longingly! oh, how regretfully! that she had not been naughty\nand wild and disobedient in her beloved teacher's absence.\n\n\"But where is the use of regretting what is done?\" she said, half aloud.\n\"I know I can never be good--never, never!\"\n\nShe pushed aside the heavy velvet curtains which shaded the door of the\nprivate sitting-room, and went in, to find Mrs Willis seated by her\ndesk, very pale and tired and unhappy looking, while Dora Russell, with\ncrimson spots on her cheeks and a very angry glitter in her eyes, stood\nby the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Come here, Annie dear,\" said Mrs Willis in her usual gentle and\naffectionate tone.\n\nAnnie's first wild impulse was to rush to her governess's side, to fling\nher arms round her neck, and, as a child would confess to her mother, to\ntell her all that story of the walk through the wood, and the stolen\npicnic in the fairies' field.  Three things, however, restrained her--\nshe must not relieve her own troubles at the expense of betraying\nothers; she could not, even if she were willing, say a word in the\npresence of this cold and angry-looking Dora; in the third place, Mrs\nWillis looked very tired and very sad.  Not for worlds would she add to\nher troubles at this instant.  She came into the room, however, with a\nslight hesitation of manner, and a clouded brow, which caused Mrs\nWillis to watch her with anxiety, and Dora with triumph.\n\n\"Come here, Annie,\" repeated the governess.  \"I want to speak to you.\nSomething very dishonourable and disgraceful has been done in my\nabsence.\"\n\nAnnie's face suddenly became as white as a sheet.  Could the\ngypsy-mother have already betrayed them all?\n\nMrs Willis, noticing her too evident confusion, continued in a voice,\nwhich, in spite of herself, became stern and severe.\n\n\"I shall expect the truth at any cost, my dear.  Look at this\nmanuscript-book.  Do you know anything of the handwriting?\"\n\n\"Why, it is yours, of course, Dora,\" said Annie, who was now absolutely\nbewildered.\n\n\"It is _not_ mine,\" began Dora, but Mrs Willis held up her hand.\n\n\"Allow me to speak, Miss Russell.  I can best explain matters.  Annie,\nduring my absence some one has been guilty of a very base and wicked\nact.  One of the girls in this school has gone secretly to Dora\nRussell's desk, and taken away ten pages of an essay which she had\ncalled `The River,' and which she was preparing for the prize\ncompetition next month.  Instead of Dora's essay this that you now see\nwas put in its place.  Examine it, my dear.  Can you tell me anything\nabout it?\"\n\nAnnie took the manuscript-book, and turned the leaves.\n\n\"Is it meant for a parody?\" she asked, after a pause; \"it sounds\nridiculous.  No, Mrs Willis, I know nothing whatever about it; some one\nhas imitated Dora's handwriting.  I cannot imagine who is the culprit.\"\n\nShe threw the manuscript-book with a certain easy carelessness on the\ntable by her side, and glanced up with a twinkle of mirth in her eyes at\nDora.\n\n\"I suppose it is meant for a clever parody,\" she repeated; \"at least it\nis amusing.\"\n\nHer manner displeased Mrs Willis, and very nearly maddened poor Dora.\n\n\"We have not sent for you, Annie,\" said her teacher, \"to ask you your\nopinion of the parody, but to try and get you to throw light on the\nsubject.  We must find out, and at once, who has been so wicked as to\ndeliberately injure another girl.\"\n\n\"But why have you sent for _me_?\" asked Annie, drawing herself up, and\nspeaking with a little shade of haughtiness.\n\n\"Because,\" said Dora Russell, who could no longer contain her outraged\nfeelings, \"because you alone can throw light on it--because you alone in\nthe school are base enough to do anything so mean--because you alone can\ncaricature.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is it,\" said Annie; \"you suspect me, then.  Do _you_ suspect\nme, Mrs Willis?\"\n\n\"My dear--what can I say?\"\n\n\"Nothing, if you do.  In this school my word has long gone for nothing.\nI am a naughty, headstrong, wilful girl, but in this matter I am\nperfectly innocent.  I never saw that essay before; I never in all my\nlife went to Dora Russell's desk.  I am headstrong and wild, but I don't\ndo spiteful things.  I have no object in injuring Dora; she is nothing\nto me--nothing.  She is trying for the essay prize, but she has no\nchance of winning it.  Why should I trouble myself to injure her? why\nshould I even take the pains to parody her words and copy her\nhandwriting?  Mrs Willis, you need not believe me--I see you do not\nbelieve me--but I am quite innocent.\"\n\nHere Annie burst into sudden tears, and ran out of the room.\n\nCHAPTER 33. UNTRUSTWORTHY.\n\nDora Russell had declared, in Hester's presence, and with intense energy\nin her manner, that the author of the insult to which she had been\nexposed should be publicly punished, and, if possible, expelled.  On the\nevening of her interview with the head teacher, she had so far forgotten\nherself as to reiterate this desire with extreme vehemence.  She had\nboldly declared her firm conviction of Annie's guilt, and had broadly\nhinted at Mrs Willis's favouritism toward her.  The great dignity,\nhowever, of her teacher's manner, and the half-sorrowful, half-indignant\nlook she bestowed on the excited girl, calmed her down after a time.\nMrs Willis felt full sympathy for Dora, and could well understand how\ntrying and aggravating this practical joke must be to so proud a girl;\nbut although her faith was undoubtedly shaken in Annie, she would not\nallow this sentiment to appear.\n\n\"I will do all I can for you, Dora,\" she said, when the weeping Annie\nhad left the room; \"I will do everything in my power to find out who has\ninjured you.  Annie has absolutely denied the accusation you bring\nagainst her, and unless her guilt can be proved it is but right to\nbelieve her innocent.  There are many other girls in Lavender House; and\nto-morrow morning I will sift this unpleasant affair to the very bottom.\nGo, now, my dear, and if you have sufficient self-command and\nself-control, try to have courage to write your essay over again.  I\nhave no doubt that your second rendering of your subject will be more\nattractive than the first.  Beginners cannot too often re-write their\nthemes.\"\n\nDora gave her head a proud little toss, but she was sufficiently in awe\nof Mrs Willis to keep back any retort, and she went out of the room\nfeeling unsatisfied and wretched, and inclined for a sympathising chat\nwith her little friend, Hester Thornton.\n\nHester, however, when she reached her, seemed not at all disposed to\ntalk to anyone.\n\n\"I've had it all out with Mrs Willis, and there is no doubt she will be\nexposed to-morrow morning,\" said Dora, half aloud.\n\nHester, whose head was bent over her French history, looked up with an\nannoyed expression.\n\n\"Who will be exposed?\" she asked, in a petulant voice.\n\n\"Oh, how stupid you are growing, Hester Thornton!\" exclaimed Dora; \"why,\nthat horrid Annie Forest, of course--but really I have no patience to\ntalk to you; you have lost all your spirit.  I was very foolish to\ndemean myself by taking so much notice of one of the little girls.\"\n\nDora sailed down the play-room to her own drawing-room, fully expecting\nHester to rise and rush after her; but to her surprise Hester did not\nstir, but sat with her head bent over her book, and her cheeks slightly\nflushed.\n\nThe next morning Mrs Willis kept her word to Dora, and made the very\nstrictest inquiries with regard to the practical joke to which Dora had\nbeen subjected.  She first of all fully explained what had taken place\nin the presence of the whole school, and then each girl was called up in\nrotation, and asked two questions: first, had she done this mischievous\nthing herself? second, could she throw any light on the subject?\n\nOne by one each girl appeared before her teacher, replied in the\nnegative to both queries, and returned to her seat.\n\n\"Now, girls,\" said Mrs Willis, \"you have each of you denied this\ncharge.  Such a thing as has happened to Dora could not have been done\nwithout hands.  The teachers in the school are above suspicion; the\nservants are none of them clever enough to perform this base trick.  I\nsuspect one of you, and I am quite determined to get at the truth.\nDuring the whole of this half-year there has been a spirit of\nunhappiness, of mischief, and of suspicion in our midst.  Under these\ncircumstances love cannot thrive; under these circumstances the true and\nennobling sense of brotherly kindness, and all those feelings which real\nreligion prompt must languish.  I tell you all now plainly that I will\nnot have this thing in Lavender House.  It is simply disgraceful for one\ngirl to play such tricks on her fellows.  This is not the first time nor\nthe second time that the school-desks have been tampered with.  I will\nfind out--I am determined to find out, who this dishonest person is; and\nas she has not chosen to confess to me, as she has preferred falsehood\nto truth, I will visit her, when I do discover her, with my very gravest\ndispleasure.  In this school I have always endeavoured to inculcate the\ntrue principles of honour and of trust.  I have laid down certain broad\nrules, and expect them to be obeyed; but I have never hampered you with\npetty and humiliating restraints.  I have given you a certain freedom,\nwhich I believed to be for your best good, and I have never suspected\none of you until you have given me due cause.\n\n\"Now, however, I tell you plainly that I alter all my tactics.  One girl\nsitting in this room is guilty.  For her sake I shall treat you all as\nguilty, and punish you accordingly.  For the remainder of this term, or\nuntil the hour when the guilty girl chooses to release her companions,\nyou are all, with the exception of the little children and Miss Russell,\nwho can scarcely have played this trick on herself, under punishment.  I\nwithdraw your half-holidays--I take from you the use of the South\nParlour for your acting, and every drawing-room in the play-room is\nconfiscated.  But this, is not all that I do.  In taking from you my\ntrust, I must treat you as untrustworthy--you will no longer enjoy the\nliberty you used to delight in--everywhere you will be watched.  A\nteacher will sit in your play-room with you, a teacher will accompany\nyou into the grounds, and I tell you plainly, girls, that chance words\nand phrases which drop from your lips shall be taken up, and used, if\nnecessary, to the elucidation of this disgraceful mystery.\"\n\nHere Mrs Willis left the room, and the teachers desired the several\ngirls in their classes to attend to their morning studies.\n\nNothing could exceed the dismay which her words had produced.  The\ninnocent girls were fairly stunned, and from that hour for many a day\nall sunshine and happiness seemed really to have left Lavender House.\n\nThe two, however, who felt the change most acutely, and on whose altered\nfaces their companions began to fix suspicious eyes, were Annie Forest\nand Hester Thornton.  Hester was burdened with an intolerable sense of\nthe shameful falsehood she had told; Annie, guilty in another matter,\nsuccumbed at last utterly to a sense of misery and injustice.  Her\norphaned and lonely position for the first time began to tell on her;\nshe ate little and slept little, her face grew very pale and thin, and\nher health really suffered.\n\nAll the routine of happy life at Lavender House was changed.  In the\nlarge play-room the drawing-rooms were unused; there were no pleasant\nlittle knots of girls whispering happily and confidentially together,\nfor whenever two or three girls sat down to have a chat they found that\none or another of the teachers was within hearing.  The acting for the\ncoming play progressed so languidly that no one expected it would really\ntake place, and the one relief and relaxation to the unhappy girls lay\nin the fact that the holidays were not far off, and that in the meantime\nthey might work hard for the prizes.\n\nThe days passed in a truly melancholy fashion, and, perhaps, for the\nfirst time the girls fully appreciated the old privileges of freedom and\ntrust which were now forfeited.  There was a feeble little attempt at a\njoke and a laugh in the school at Dora's expense.  The most frivolous of\nthe girls whispered of her as she passed as \"the muddy stream;\" but no\none took up the fun with avidity--the shadow of somebody's sin had\nfallen too heavily upon all the bright young lives.\n\nCHAPTER 34. BETTY FALLS ILL AT AN AWKWARD TIME.\n\nThe eight girls who had gone out on their midnight picnic were much\nstartled one day by an unpleasant discovery.  Betty had never come for\nher basket.  Susan Drummond, who had a good deal of curiosity, and\nalways poked her nose into unexpected corners, had been walking with a\nMiss Allison in that part of the grounds where the laurel-bush stood.\nShe had caught a peep of the white handle of the basket, and had\ninstantly turned her companion's attention to something else.  Miss\nAllison had not observed Susan's start of dismay; but Susan had taken\nthe first opportunity of getting rid of her, and had run off in search\nof one of the girls who had shared in the picnic.  She came across Annie\nForest, who was walking, as usual, by herself, with her head slightly\nbent, and her curling hair in sad confusion.  Susan whispered the\ndireful intelligence that old Betty had forsaken them, and that the\nbasket, with its ginger-beer bottles and its stained table-cloth, might\nbe discovered at any moment.\n\nAnnie's pale face flushed slightly at Susan's words.\n\n\"Why should we try to conceal the thing?\" she said, speaking with sudden\nenergy, and a look of hope and animation coming back to her face.\n\"Susy, let's go, all of us, and tell the miserable truth to Mrs Willis;\nit will be much the best way.  We did not do the other thing, and when\nwe have confessed about this our hearts will be at rest.\"\n\n\"No, we did not do the other thing,\" said Susan, a queer grey colour\ncoming over her face; \"but confess about this, Annie Forest!--I think\nyou are mad.  You dare not tell.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Annie, \"I won't, unless you all agree to it,\" and then\nshe continued her walk, leaving Susan standing on the gravelled path\nwith her hands clasped together, and a look of most genuine alarm and\ndismay on her usually phlegmatic face.\n\nSusan quickly found Phyllis and Nora, and it was only too easy to arouse\nthe fears of these timid little people.  Their poor little faces became\nalmost pallid, and they were not a little startled at the fact of Annie\nForest, their own arch-conspirator, wishing to betray their secret.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Susan Drummond, \"she's not out and out shabby; she says she\nwon't tell unless we all wish it.  But what is to become of the basket?\"\n\n\"Come, come, young ladies; no whispering, if you please,\" said Miss\nGood, who came up at this moment.  \"Susan, you are looking pale and\ncold, walk up and down that path half-a-dozen times, and then go into\nthe house.  Phyllis and Nora, you can come with me as far as the lodge.\nI want to take a message from Mrs Willis to Mary Martin about the fowl\nfor to-morrow's dinner.\"\n\nPhyllis and Nora, with dismayed faces, waited solemnly away with the\nEnglish teacher, and Susan was left to her solitary meditations.\n\nThings had come to such a pass that her slow wits were brought into\nplay, and she neither felt sleepy, nor did she indulge in her usual\nhabit of eating lollipops.\n\nThat basket might be discovered any day, and then--then disgrace was\nimminent.  Susan could not make out what had become of old Betty; never\nbefore had she so utterly failed them.\n\nBetty lived in a little cottage about half a mile from Lavender House.\nShe was a sturdy, apple-cheeked, little old woman, and had for many a\nday added to her income--indeed, almost supported herself--by means of\nthe girls at Lavender House.  The large cherry trees in her little\ngarden bore their rich crop of fruit year after year for Mrs Willis's\ngirls, and every day at an early hour Betty would tramp into Sefton and\nreturn with a temptingly-laden basket of the most approved cakes and\ntarts.  There was a certain paling at one end of the grounds to which\nBetty used to come.  Here on the grass she would sit contentedly with\nthe contents of her basket arranged in the most tempting order before\nher, and to this seductive spot she knew well that those little Misses\nwho loved goodies, cakes, and tartlets would be sure to find their way.\nBetty charged high for her wares; but, as she was always obliging in the\nmatter of credit the thoughtless girls cared very little that they paid\ndouble the shop prices for Betty's cakes.  The best girls in the school,\ncertainly, never went to Betty; but Annie Forest, Susan Drummond, and\nseveral others had regular accounts with her, and few days passed that\ntheir young faces would not peep over the paling and their voices ask--\n\n\"What have you got to tempt me with to-day, Betty?\"\n\nIt was, however, in the matter of stolen picnics, of grand feasts in the\nold attic, etc, etc, that Betty was truly great.  No one so clever as\nshe in concealing a basket of delicious eatables, no one knew better\nwhat school-girls liked.  She undoubtedly charged her own prices, but\nwhat she gave was of the best, and Betty was truly in her element when\nshe had an order from the young ladies of Lavender House for a grand\nsecret feast.\n\n\"You shall have it, my pretties--you shall have it,\" she would say,\nwrinkling up her bright blue eyes, and smiling broadly.  \"You leave it\nto Betty, my little loves; you leave it to Betty.\"\n\nOn the occasion of the picnic to the fairies' field Betty had, indeed,\nsurpassed herself in the delicious eatables she had provided; all had\ngone smoothly, the basket had been placed in a secure hiding-place under\nthe thick laurel.  It was to be fetched away by Betty herself at an\nearly hour on the following morning.\n\nNo wonder Susan was perplexed as she paced about and pretended to warm\nherself.  It was a June evening, but the weather was still a little\ncold.  Susan remembered now that.  Betty had not come to her favourite\nstation at the stile for several days.  Was it possible that the old\nwoman was ill?  As this idea occurred to her, Susan became more alarmed.\nShe knew that there was very little chance of the basket remaining long\nin concealment.  Rover might any day remember his pleasant picnic with\naffection, and drag the white basket from under the laurel-bush.\nMichael the gardener would be certain to see it when next he cleaned up\nthe back avenue.  Oh, it was more than dangerous to leave it there, and\nyet Susan knew of no better hiding-place.  A sudden idea came to her:\nshe pulled out her pretty little watch, and saw that she need not return\nto the house for another half-hour.  \"Suppose she ran as fast as\npossible to Betty's little cottage, and begged of the old woman to come\nby the first light in the morning and fetch away the basket?\"\n\nThe moment Susan conceived this idea she resolved to put it into\nexecution.  She looked around her hastily; no teacher was in sight, Miss\nGood was away at the lodge, Miss Danesbury was playing with the little\nchildren.  Mademoiselle, she knew, had gone indoors with a bad headache.\nShe left the broad walk where she had been desired to stay, and,\nplunging into the shrubbery, soon reached Betty's paling.  In a moment\nshe had climbed the bars, had jumped lightly into the field, and was\nrunning as fast as possible in the direction of Betty's cottage.  She\nreached the high road, and started and trembled violently as a carriage\nwith some ladies and gentlemen passed her.  She thought she recognised\nthe faces of the two little Misses Bruce, but did not dare to look at\nthem, and hurried panting along the road, and hoping she might be\nmistaken.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour she had reached Betty's little\ncottage, and was standing trying to recover her breath by the shut door.\nThe place had a deserted look, and several overripe cherries had fallen\nfrom the trees and were lying neglected on the ground.  Susan knocked\nimpatiently.  There was no discernible answer.  She had no time to wait,\nshe lifted the latch, which yielded to her pressure, and went in.\n\nPoor old Betty, crippled, and in severe pain with rheumatism, was lying\non her little bed.\n\n\"Eh, dear--and is that you, my pretty Missy?\" she asked, as Susan, hot\nand tired, came up to her side.\n\n\"Oh, Betty, are you ill?\" asked Miss Drummond.  \"I came to tell you you\nhave forgotten the basket.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, no--not forgot.  By no means that, lovey; but I has been\ntook with the rheumatism this past week, and can't move hand nor foot.\nI was wondering how you'd do without your cakes and tartlets, dear, and\nto think of them cherries lying there good for nothing on the ground is\nenough to break one's 'eart.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Susan, giving an appreciative glance toward the open\ndoor.  \"They are beautiful cherries, and full of juice, I am sure.  I'll\ntake a few, Betty, as I am going out, and pay you for them another day.\nBut what I have come about now is the basket.  You must get the basket\naway, however ill you are.  If the basket is discovered we are all lost,\nand then good-bye to your gains.\"\n\n\"Well, Missy, dear, if I could crawl on my hands and knees I'd go and\nfetch it, rather than you should be worried; but I can't set fool to the\nground at all.  The doctor says as 'tis somethink like rheumatic fever\nas I has.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear,\" said Susan, not wasting any of her precious\nmoments in pitying the poor suffering old woman.  \"What _is_ to be done?\nI tell you, Betty, if that basket is found we are all lost.\"\n\n\"But the laurel is very thick, lovey; it ain't likely to be found--it\nain't, indeed.\"\n\n\"I tell you it _is_ likely to be found, you tiresome old woman, and you\nreally must go for it or send for it.  You really must.\"\n\nOld Betty began to ponder.\n\n\"There's Moses,\" she said, after a pause of anxious thought; \"he's a\n'cute little chap, and he might go.  He lives in the fourth cottage\nalong the lane.  Moses is his name--Moses Moore.  I'd give him a pint of\ncherries for the job.  If you wouldn't mind sending Moses to me, Miss\nSusan, why, I'll do my best; only it seems a pity to let anybody into\nyour secrets, young ladies, but old Betty herself.\"\n\n\"It is a pity,\" said Susan; \"but, under the circumstances, it can't be\nhelped.  What cottage did you say this Moses lived in?\"\n\n\"The fourth from here, down the lane, lovey--Moses is the lad's name;\nhe's a freckled boy, with a cast in one eye.  You send him up to me,\ndearie, but don't mention the cherries, or he'll be after stealing them.\nHe's a sad rogue, is Moses; but I think I can tempt him with the\ncherries.\"\n\nSusan did not wait to bid poor old Betty \"good-bye,\" but ran out of the\ncottage, shutting the door after her, and snatching up two or three ripe\ncherries to eat on her way.  She was so far fortunate as to find the\nredoubtable Moses at home, and to convey him bodily to old Betty's\npresence.  The queer boy grinned horribly, and looked as wicked as boy\ncould look; but on the subject of cherries he was undoubtedly\nsusceptible, and after a good deal of haggling and insisting that the\npint should be a quart, he expressed his willingness to start off at\nfour o'clock on the following morning, and bring away the basket from\nunder the laurel-tree.\n\nCHAPTER 35. \"YOU ARE WELCOME TO TELL.\"\n\nAnnie continued her walk.  The circumstances of the last two months had\ncombined to do for her what nothing had hitherto effected.  When a\nlittle child she had known hardship and privation, she had passed\nthrough that experience which is metaphorically spoken of as \"going down\nhill.\"  As a baby little Annie had been surrounded by comforts and\nluxuries, and her father and mother had lived in a large house, and kept\na carriage, and Annie had two nurses to wait on herself alone.  These\nwere in the days before she could remember anything.  With her first\nearly memories came the recollection of a much smaller house, of much\nfewer servants, of her mother often in tears, and her father often away.\nThen there was no house at all that the Forests could call their own,\nonly rooms of a tolerably cheerful character, and Annie's nurse went\naway, and she look her daily walks by her mother's side and slept in a\nlittle cot in her mother's room.  Then came a very, very sad day, when\nher mother lay cold and still and fainting on her bed, and her tall and\nhandsome father caught Annie in his arms and pressed her to his heart,\nand told her to be a good child and to keep up her spirits, and, above\nall things, to take care of mother.  Then her father had gone away; and\nthough Annie expected him back, he did not come, and she and her mother\nwent into poorer and shabbier lodgings, and her mother began to try her\ntear-dimmed eyes by working at church embroidery, and Annie used to\nnotice that she coughed a good deal as she worked.  Then there was\nanother move, and this time Mrs Forest and her little daughter found\nthemselves in one bedroom, and things began to grow very gloomy and food\neven was scarce.  At last there was a change.  One day a lady came into\nthe dingy little room, and all of a sudden it seemed as if the sun had\ncome out again.  This lady brought comforts with her--toys and books for\nthe child, good, brave words of cheer for the mother.  At last Annie's\nmother died, and she went away to Lavender House to live with this good\nfriend who had made her mother's dying hours easy.\n\n\"Annie, Annie,\" said the dying mother, \"I owe everything to Mrs Willis;\nwe knew each other long ago when we were girls, and she has come to me\nnow and made everything easy.  When I am gone she will take care of you.\nOh, my child, I cannot repay her; but will you try?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother,\" said little Annie, gazing full into her mother's face\nwith her sweet bright eyes, \"I'll--I'll love her, mother; I'll give her\nlots and lots of love.\"\n\nAnnie had gone to Lavender House, and kept her word, for she had almost\nworshipped the good mistress who was so true and kind to her, and who\nhad so befriended her mother.  Through all the vicissitudes of her short\nexistence Annie had, however, never lost one precious gift.  Hers was an\naffectionate, but also a wonderfully bright, nature.  It was as\nimpossible for Annie to turn away from laughter and merriment as it\nwould be for a flower to keep its head determinedly turned from the sun.\nIn their darkest days Annie had managed to make her mother laugh; her\nlittle face was a sunbeam, her very naughtinesses were of a laughable\ncharacter.\n\nHer mother died--her father was still away, but Annie retained her brave\nand cheerful spirit, for she gave and received love.  Mrs Willis loved\nher--she bestowed upon her amongst all her girls the tenderest glances,\nthe most motherly caresses.  The teachers undoubtedly corrected and even\nscolded her, but they could not help liking her, and even her worst\nscrapes made them smile.  Annie's companions adored her; the little\nchildren would do anything for their own Annie, and even the servants in\nthe school said that there was no young lady in Lavender House fit to\nhold a candle to Miss Forest.\n\nDuring the last half-year, however, things had been different.\nSuspicion and mistrust began to dog the footsteps of the bright young\ngirl; she was no longer a universal favourite--some of the girls even\nopenly expressed their dislike of her.\n\nAll this Annie could have borne, but for the fact that Mrs Willis\njoined in the universal suspicion.  The old glance now never came to her\neyes, nor the old tone to her voice.  For the first time Annie's spirits\nutterly flagged; she could not bear this universal coldness, this\nuniversal chill.  She began to droop physically as well as mentally.\n\nShe was pacing up and down the walk, thinking very sadly, wondering\nvaguely if her father would ever return, and conscious of a feeling of\nmore or less indifference to everything and everyone, when she was\nsuddenly roused from her meditation by the patter of small feet and by a\nvery eager little exclamation--\n\n\"Me tumming--me tumming, Annie!\" and then Nan raised her charming face\nand placed her cool baby hand in Annie's.\n\nThere was delicious comfort in the clasp of the little hand, and in the\nlook of love and pleasure which lit up the small face.\n\n\"Me yiding from naughty nurse--me 'tay with 'oo, Annie--me love 'oo,\nAnnie.\"\n\nAnnie stooped down, kissed the little one, and lifted her into her arms.\n\n\"Why ky?\" said Nan, who saw with consternation two big tears in Annie's\neyes; \"dere, poor ickle Annie--me love 'oo--me buy 'oo a new doll.\"\n\n\"Dearest little darling,\" said Annie in a voice of almost passionate\npain; then, with that wonderful instinct which made her in touch with\nall little children, she cheered up, wiped away her tears, and allowed\nlaughter once more to wreathe her lips and fill her eyes.  \"Come, Nan,\"\nshe said, \"you and I will have such a race.\"\n\nShe placed the child on her shoulder, clasped the little hands securely\nround her neck, and ran to the sound of Nan's shouts down the shady\nwalk.\n\nAt the farther end Nan suddenly tightened her clasp, drew herself up,\nceased to laugh, and said with some fright in her voice--\n\n\"Who dat?\"\n\nAnnie, too, stood still with a sudden start, for the gypsy woman, Mother\nRachel, was standing directly in their path.\n\n\"Go 'way, naughty woman,\" said Nan, shaking her small hand imperiously.\n\nThe gypsy dropped a low curtsey, and spoke in a slightly mocking tone.\n\n\"A pretty little dear,\" she said.  \"Yes, truly now, a pretty little\nwinsome dear; and oh, what shoes! and little open-work socks! and I\ndon't doubt real lace trimming on all her little garments--I don't doubt\nit a bit.\"\n\n\"Go 'way--me don't like 'oo,\" said Nan.  \"Let's wun back--gee, gee,\" she\nsaid, addressing Annie, whom she had constituted into a horse for the\ntime being.\n\n\"Yes, Nan; in one minute,\" said Annie.  \"Please, Mother Rachel, what are\nyou doing here?\"\n\n\"Only waiting to see you, pretty Missie,\" replied the tall gypsy.  \"You\nare the dear little lady who crossed my hand with silver that night in\nthe wood.  Eh, but it was a bonny night, with a bonny bright moon, and\nnone of the dear little ladies meant any harm--no, no.  Mother Rachel\nknows that.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Annie, \"I'm not going to be afraid of you.  I have no\nmore silver to give you.  If you like, you may go up to the house and\ntell what you have seen.  I am very unhappy, and whether you tell or not\ncan make very little difference to me now.  Good-night; I am not the\nleast afraid of you--you can do just as you please about telling Mrs\nWillis.\"\n\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said the gypsy; \"do you think I'd work you any harm--you,\nand the seven other dear little ladies?  No, not for the world, my\ndear--not for the world.  You don't know Mother Rachel when you think\nshe'd be that mean.\"\n\n\"Well, don't come here again,\" said Annie.  \"Good-night.\"\n\nShe turned on her heel, and Nan shouted back--\n\n\"Go 'way, naughty woman--Nan don't love 'oo, 'tall, 'tall.\"\n\nThe gypsy stood still for a moment with a frown knitting her brows; then\nshe slowly turned, and, creeping on all-fours through the underwood,\nclimbed the hedge into the field beyond.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she laughed, after a moment; \"the little Missy thinks she\nain't afraid of me; but she be.  Trust Mother Rachel for knowing that\nmuch.  I make no doubt,\" she added after a pause, \"that the little one's\nclothes are trimmed with real lace.  Well, little Missie Annie Forest, I\ncan see with half an eye that you set store by that baby-girl.  You had\nbetter not cross Mother Rachel's whims, or she can punish you in a way\nyou don't think of.\"\n\nCHAPTER 36. HOW MOSES MOORE KEPT HIS APPOINTMENT.\n\nSusan Drummond got back to Lavender House without apparent discovery.\nShe was certainly late when she took her place in the class-room for her\nnext day's preparation; but, beyond a very sharp reprimand from\nMademoiselle, no notice was taken of this fact.  She managed to whisper\nto Nora and Phyllis that the basket would be moved by the first dawn the\nnext morning, and the little girls went to bed happier in consequence.\nNothing ever could disturb Susan's slumbers, and that night she\ncertainly slept without rocking.  As she was getting into bed she\nventured to tell Annie how successfully she had manoeuvred; but Annie\nreceived her news with the most absolute indifference, looking at her\nfor a moment with a queer smile, and then saying--\n\n\"My own wish is that this should be found out.  As a matter of course, I\nsha'n't betray you, girls; but as things now stand I am anxious that\nMrs Willis should know the very worst of me.\"\n\nAfter a remark which Susan considered so simply idiotic, there was, of\ncourse, no further conversation between the two girls.\n\nMoses Moore had certainly promised Betty to rise soon after dawn on the\nfollowing morning and go to Lavender House to carry off the basket from\nunder the laurel-tree.  Moses, a remarkably indolent lad, had been\nstimulated by the thought of the delicious cherries which would be his\nas soon as he brought the basket to Betty.  He had cleverly stipulated\nthat a quart--not a pint--of cherries was to be his reward, and he\nlooked forward with considerable pleasure to picking them himself, and\nputting a few extra ones into his mouth on the sly.\n\nMoses was not at all the kind of boy who would have scrupled to steal a\nfew cherries; but in this particular old Betty, ill as she was, was too\nsharp for him, or for any of the other village lads.  Her bed was drawn\nup close to her little window, and her window looked directly on to the\ntwo cherry trees.  Never, to all appearance, did Betty close her eyes.\nHowever early the hour might be in which a village boy peeped over the\nwall of her garden, he always saw her white night-cap moving, and he\nknew that her bright blue eyes would be on him, and he would be\nproclaimed a thief all over the place before many minutes were over.\n\nMoses, therefore, was very glad to secure his cherries by fair means, as\nhe could not obtain them by foul; and he went to bed and to sleep\ndetermined to be off on his errand with the dawn.\n\nA very natural thing, however, happened.  Moses, unaccustomed to getting\nup at half-past three in the morning, never opened his eyes until the\nchurch clock struck five.  Then he started upright, rubbed and rubbed at\nhis sleepy orbs, tumbled into his clothes, and, softly opening the\ncottage door, set off on his errand.\n\nThe fact of his being nearly an hour and a half late did not trouble him\nin the least.  In any case, he would get to Lavender House before six\no'clock, and would have consumed his cherries in less than an hour from\nthat date.\n\nMoses sauntered gayly along the roads, whistling as he went, and\noccasionally tossing his battered cap in the air.  He often lingered on\nhis way, now to cut down a particularly tempting switch from the hedge,\nnow to hunt for a possible bird's nest.  It was very, nearly six o'clock\nwhen he reached the back avenue, swung himself over the gate, which was\nlocked, and ran softly on the dewy grass in the direction of the\nlaurel-bush.  Old Betty had given him most careful instructions, and he\nwas far too sharp a lad to forget what was necessary for the obtaining\nof a quart of cherries.  He found his tree, and lay flat down on the\nground in order to pull out the basket.  His fingers had just clasped\nthe handle when there came a sudden interruption--a rush, a growl, and\nsome very sharp teeth had inserted themselves into the back of his\nragged jacket.  Poor Moses found himself, to his horror, in the clutches\nof a great mastiff.  The creature held him tight, and laid one heavy paw\non him to prevent him rising.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Moses thought it quite unnecessary to retain\nany self-control.  He shrieked, he screamed, he wriggled; his piercing\nyells filled the air, and, fortunately for him, his being two hours too\nlate brought assistance to his aid.  Michael, the gardener, and a strong\nboy who helped him, rushed to the spot, and liberated the terrified lad,\nwho, after all, was only frightened, for Rover had satisfied himself\nwith tearing his jacket to pieces, not himself.\n\n\"Give me the b-basket,\" sobbed Moses, \"and let me g-g-go.\"\n\n\"You may certainly go, you little tramp,\" said Michael, \"but Jim and me\nwill keep the basket.  I much misdoubt me if there isn't mischief here.\nWhat's the basket put hiding here for, and who does it belong to?\"\n\n\"Old B-B-Betty,\" gasped forth the agitated Moses.\n\n\"Well, let old Betty fetch it herself.  Mrs Willis will keep it for\nher,\" said Michael.  \"Come along, Jim, get to your weeding, do.  There,\nlittle scamp, you had better make yourself scarce.\"\n\nMoses certainly look his advice, for he scuttled off like a hare.\nWhether he ever got his cherries or not, history does not disclose.\n\nMichael, looking gravely at Jim, opened the basket, examined its\ncontents, and, shaking his head solemnly, carried it into the house.\n\n\"There's been deep work going on, Jim, and my Missis ought to know,\"\nsaid Michael, who was an exceedingly strict disciplinarian.  Jim,\nhowever, had a soft corner in his heart for the young ladies, and he\ncommenced his weeding with a profound sigh.\n\nCHAPTER 37. A BROKEN TRUST.\n\nThe next morning Annie Forest opened her eyes with that strange feeling\nof indifference and want of vivacity which come so seldom to youth.  She\nsaw the sun shining through the closed blinds; she heard the birds\ntwittering and singing in the large elm-tree which nearly touched the\nwindows; she knew well how the world looked at this moment, for often\nand often in her old light-hearted days she had risen before the maid\ncame to call her, and, kneeling by the deep window-ledge, had looked out\nat the bright fresh, sparkling day.  A new day, with all its hours\nbefore it, its light vivid but not too glaring, its dress all manner of\ntender shades and harmonious colourings!  Annie had a poetical nature,\nand she gloried in these glimpses which she got all by herself of the\nfresh, glad world.\n\nTo-day, however, she lay still, sorry to know that the brief night was\nat an end, and that the day, with its coldness and suspicion, its\nterrible absence of love and harmony, was about to begin.\n\nAnnie's nature was very emotional; she was intensely sensitive to her\nsurroundings; the greyness of her present life was absolute destruction\nto such a nature as hers.\n\nThe dressing-bell rang; the maid came in to draw up the blinds, and call\nthe girls.  Annie rose languidly, and began to dress herself.\n\nShe first finished her toilet, and then approached her little bed, and\nstood by its side for a moment hesitating.  She did not want to pray,\nand yet she felt impelled to go down on her knees.  As she knelt with\nher curls falling about her face, and her bands pressed to her eyes, one\nline of one of her favourite poems came flashing with swiftness and\npower across; her memory--\n\n\"A soul which has sinned and is pardoned again.\"\n\nThe words filled her whole heart with a sudden sense of peace and of\ngreat longing.\n\nThe prayer-bell rang: she rose, and, turning to Susan Drummond, said\nearnestly--\n\n\"Oh, Susy, I do wish Mrs Willis could know about our going to the\nfairy-field; I do so want God to forgive me.\"\n\nSusan stared in her usual dull, uncomprehending way; then she flushed a\nlittle, and said brusquely--\n\n\"I think you have quite taken leave of your senses, Annie Forest.\"\n\nAnnie said no more, but at prayers in the chapel she was glad to find\nherself near gentle Cecil Temple, and the words kept repeating\nthemselves to her all during the morning lessons--\n\n\"A soul which has sinned and is pardoned again.\"\n\nJust before morning school, several of the girls started and looked\ndistressed when they found that Mrs Willis lingered in the room.  She\nstood for a moment by the English teacher's desk, said something to her\nin a low voice, and then, walking slowly to her own post at the head of\nthe great school-room, she said suddenly--\n\n\"I want to ask you a question, Miss Drummond.  Will you please just\nstand up in your place in class and answer me without a moment's\nhesitation?\"\n\nPhyllis and Nora found themselves turning very pale; Mary Price and one\nor two more of the rebels also began to tremble, but Susan looked dogged\nand indifferent enough as she turned her eyes toward her teacher.\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" she said, rising and dropping a curtsey.\n\n\"My friends, the Misses Bruce, came to call on me yesterday evening,\nSusan, and told me that they saw you running very quickly on the high\nroad in the direction of the village.  You, of course, know that you\nbroke a very distinct rule when you left the grounds without leave.\nTell me at once where you were going.\"\n\nSusan hesitated, coloured to her dullest red, and looked down.  Then,\nbecause she had no ready excuse to offer, she blurted out the truth--\n\n\"I was going to see old Betty.\"\n\n\"The cake-woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I--I heard she was ill.\"\n\n\"Indeed--you may sit down.  Miss Drummond.  Miss Good, will you ask\nMichael to step for a moment into the school-room?\"\n\nSeveral of the girls now indeed held their breath, and more than one\nheart beat with heavy, frightened bumps as a moment later Michael\nfollowed Miss Good into the room, carrying the redoubtable picnic-basket\non his arm.\n\n\"Michael,\" said Mrs Willis, \"I wish you to tell the young ladies\nexactly how you found the basket this morning.  Stand by my side,\nplease, and speak loud enough for them to hear.\"  After a moment's pause\nMichael related somewhat diffusely and with an occasional break in his\nnarrative the scene which had occurred between him and Moses that\nmorning.\n\n\"That will do, Michael; you can now go,\" said the head-mistress.\n\nShe waited until the old servant had closed the door, and then she\nturned to her girls--\n\n\"It is not quite a fortnight since I stood where I now stand, and asked\none girl to be honourable and to save her companions.  One girl was\nguilty of sin and would not confess, and for her sake all her companions\nare now suffering.  I am tired of this sort of thing--I am tired of\nstanding in this place and appealing to your honour, which is dead, to\nyour truth, which is nowhere.  Girls, you puzzle me--you half break my\nheart.  In this case more than one is guilty.  How many of the girls in\nLavender House are going to tell me a lie this morning?\"  There was a\nvery brief pause; then a slight cry, and a girl rose from her seat and\nwalked up the long school-room.  \"I am the most guilty of all,\" said\nAnnie Forest.\n\n\"Annie!\" said Mrs Willis, in a tone half of pain, half of relief, \"have\nyou come to your senses at last?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad to be able to speak the truth,\" said Annie.  \"Please\npunish me very, very hard; I am the most guilty of all.\"\n\n\"What did you do with this basket?\"\n\n\"We took it for a picnic--it was my plan, I led the others.\"\n\n\"Where was your picnic?\"\n\n\"In the fairies' field.\"\n\n\"Ah!  At what time?\"\n\n\"At night--in the middle of the night--the night you went to London.\"\n\nMrs Willis put her hand to her brow; her face was very white and the\ngirls could see that she trembled.\n\n\"I trusted my girls--\" she said; then she broke off abruptly.\n\n\"You had companions in this wickedness--name them.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had companions; I led them on.\"\n\n\"Name them, Miss Forest.\"\n\nFor the first time Annie raised her eyes to Mrs Willis's face: then she\nturned and looked down the long school-room.  \"Oh, won't they tell\nthemselves?\" she said.\n\nNothing could be more appealing than her glance.  It melted the hearts\nof Phyllis and Nora, who began to sob, and to declare brokenly that they\nhad gone too, and that they were very, very sorry.\n\nSpurred by their example Mary Price also confessed, and one by one all\nthe little conspirators revealed the truth, with the exception of Susan,\nwho kept her eyes steadily fixed on the floor.\n\n\"Susan Drummond,\" said Mrs Willis, \"come here.\"\n\nThere was something in her tone which startled every girl in the school.\nNever had they heard this ring in their teacher's voice before.\n\n\"Susan,\" said Mrs Willis, \"I don't ask you if you are guilty; I fear,\npoor miserable girl, that if I did you would load your conscience with a\nfresh lie.  I don't ask you if you are guilty because I know you are.\nThe fact of your running without leave to see old Betty is\ncircumstantial evidence.  I judge you by that and pronounce you guilty.\nNow, young ladies, you who have treated me so badly, who have betrayed\nmy trust, who have been wanting in honour, I must think, I must ask God\nto teach me how to deal with you.  In the meantime, you cannot associate\nwith your companions.  Miss Good, will you take each of these eight\ngirls to their bedrooms.\"\n\nAs Annie was leaving the room she looked full into Mrs Willis's face.\nStrange to say, at this moment of her great disgrace the cloud which had\nso long brooded over her was lifted.  The sweet eyes never looked\nsweeter.  The old Annie, and yet a better and a braver Annie than had\never existed before, followed her companions out of the school-room.\n\nCHAPTER 38. IS SHE STILL GUILTY?\n\nOn the evening of that day Cecil Temple knocked at the door of Mrs\nWillis's private sitting-room.\n\n\"Ah, Cecil! is that you?\" said her governess.  \"I am always glad to see\nyou, dear; but I happen to be particularly busy to-night.  Have you\nanything in particular to say to me?\"\n\n\"I only wanted to talk about Annie, Mrs Willis.  You believe in her at\nlast, don't you?\"\n\n\"Believe in her at last!\" said the head-mistress in a tone of\nastonishment and deep pain.  \"No, Cecil, my dear; you ask too much of my\nfaith.  I do not believe in Annie.\"\n\nCecil paused; she hesitated, and seemed half afraid to proceed.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said at last in a slightly timid tone, \"you have not seen\nher since this morning?\"\n\n\"No; I have been particularly busy.  Besides, the eight culprits are\nunder punishment; part of their punishment is that I will not see them.\"\n\n\"Don't you think, Mrs Willis,\" said Cecil, \"that Annie made rather a\nbrave confession this morning?\"\n\n\"I admit, my dear, that Annie spoke in somewhat of her old impulsive\nway; she blamed herself, and did not try to screen her--misdemeanours\nbehind her companions.  In this one particular she reminded me of the\nold Annie who, notwithstanding all her faults.  I used to trust and\nlove.  But as to her confession being very brave, my dear Cecil, you\nmust remember that she did not _confess_ until she was obliged; she\nknew, and so did all the other girls, that I could have got the truth\nout of old Betty had they chosen to keep their lips sealed.  Then, my\ndear, consider what she did.  On the very night that I was away she\nviolated the trust I had in her--she bade me `good-bye' with smiles and\nsweet glances, and then she did this in my absence.  No, Cecil, I fear\npoor Annie is not what we thought her.  She has done untold mischief\nduring the half-year, and has willfully lied and deceived me.  I find,\non comparing dates, that it was on the very night of the girls picnic\nthat Dora's theme was changed.  There is no doubt whatever that Annie\nwas the guilty person.  I did my best to believe in her, and to depend\non Mr Everard's judgment of her character, but I confess I can do so no\nlonger.  Cecil, dear, I am not surprised that you look pale and sad.\nNo, we will not give up this poor Annie; we will try to love her even\nthrough her sin.  Ah! poor child, poor child! how much I have prayed for\nher!  She was to me as a child of my own.  Now, dear Cecil, I must ask\nyou to leave me.\"\n\nCecil went slowly out of her governess's presence, and, wandering across\nthe wide stone hall, she entered the play-room.  It happened to be a wet\nnight, and the room was full of girls, who hung together in groups and\nwhispered softly.  There were no loud voices, and, except from the\nlittle ones, there was no laughter.  A great depression hung over the\nplace, and few could have recognised the happy girls of Lavender House\nin these sad young faces.  Cecil walked slowly into the room, and\npresently finding Hester Thornton, she sat down by her side.\n\n\"I can't get Mrs Willis to see it,\" she said very sadly.  \"What?\" asked\nHester.\n\n\"Why, that we have got our old Annie back again; that she did take the\ngirls out to that picnic, and was as wild, and reckless, and naughty as\npossible about it; and then, just like the old Annie I have always\nknown, the moment the fun was over she began to repent, and that she has\ngone on repenting ever since, which has accounted for her poor, sad\nlittle face and white cheeks.  Of course she longed to tell--Nora and\nPhyllis have told me so--but she would not betray them.  Now at last\nthere is a load off her heart, and, though she is in great disgrace and\npunishment, she is not very unhappy.  I went to see her an hour ago, and\nI saw in her face that my own darling Annie has returned.  But what do\nyou think Mrs Willis does, Hester?  She is so hurt and disappointed,\nthat she believes Annie is guilty of the other thing--she believes that\nAnnie stole Dora's theme, and that she caricatured her in my book some\ntime ago.  She believes it--she is sure of it.  Now, do you think,\nHester, that Annie's face would look quite peaceful and happy to-night\nif she had only confessed half her faults--if she had this meanness,\nthis sin, these lies still resting on her soul?  Oh!  I wish Mrs Willis\nwould see her!  I wish--I wish I but I can do nothing.  You agree with\nme, don't you, Hester?  Just put yourself in Annie's place, and tell me\nif _you_ would feel happy, and if your heart would be at rest, if you\nhad only confessed half your sin, and if through you all your\nschool-fellows were under disgrace and suspicion?  You could not, could\nyou, Hester?  Why, Hester, how white you are!\"\n\n\"You are so metaphysical,\" said Hester, rising; \"you quite puzzle me.\nHow can I put myself in your friend Annie's place?  I never understood\nher--I never wanted to.  Put myself in her place?--no, certainly that\nI'm never likely to.  I hope that I shall never be in such a\npredicament.\"\n\nHester walked away, and Cecil sat still in great perplexity.  Cecil was\na girl with a true sense of religion.  The love of God guided every\naction of her simple and straightforward life.  She was neither\nbeautiful nor clever; but no one in the school was more respected and\nhonoured, no one more sincerely loved.  Cecil knew what the peace of God\nmeant, and when she saw even a shadowy reflection of that peace on\nAnnie's little face, she was right in believing that she must be\ninnocent of the guilt which was attributed to her.\n\nThe whole school assembled for prayers that night in the little chapel,\nand Mr Everard, who had heard the story of that day's confession from\nMrs Willis, said a few words appropriate to the occasion to the unhappy\nyoung girls.\n\nWhatever effect his words had on the others, and they were very simple\nand straightforward, Annie's face grew quiet and peaceful as she\nlistened to them.  The old clergyman assured the girls that God was\nwaiting to forgive those who truly repented, and that the way to repent\nwas to rise up and sin no more.\n\n\"The present fun is not worth the after-pain,\" he said in conclusion.\n\"It is an old saying that stolen waters are sweet, but only at the time:\nafterwards only those who drink of them know the full extent of their\nbitterness.\"\n\nThis little address from Mr Everard strengthened poor Annie for an\nordeal which was immediately before her, for Mrs Willis asked all the\nschool to follow her to the play-room, and there she told them that she\nwas about to restore to them their lost privileges; that circumstances,\nin her opinion, now so strongly pointed the guilt of the stolen essay in\nthe direction of one girl, that she could no longer ask the school to\nsuffer for her sake.\n\n\"She still refuses to confess her sin,\" said Mrs Willis, \"but, unless\nanother girl proclaims herself guilty, and proves to me beyond doubt\nthat she drew the caricature which was found in Cecil Temple's book, and\nthat she changed Dora Russell's essay, and, imitating her hand, put\nanother in its place, I proclaim the guilty person to be Annie Forest,\nand on her alone I visit my displeasure.  You can retire to your rooms,\nyoung ladies.  To-morrow morning Lavender House resumes its old\ncheerfulness.\"\n\nCHAPTER 39. HESTER'S HOUR OF TRIAL.\n\nHowever calmly or however peacefully Annie slept that night, poor Hester\ndid not close her eyes.  The white face of the girl she had wronged and\ninjured kept rising before her.  Why had she so deceived Annie?  Why\nfrom the very first had she turned from her and misjudged her, and\nmisrepresented her?  Was Annie, indeed, all bad?  Hester had to own to\nherself that to-night Annie was better than she--was greater than she.\nCould she now have undone the past, she would not have acted as she had\ndone; she would not for the sake of a little paltry revenge have defiled\nher conscience with a lie, have told her governess that she could throw\nno light on the circumstance of the stolen essay.  This was the first\nlie Hester had ever told; she was naturally both straightforward and\nhonourable, but her sin of sins, that which made her hard and almost\nunlovable, was an intensely proud and haughty spirit.  She was very\nsorry she had told that lie; she was very sorry she had yielded to that\ntemptation; but not for worlds would she now humble herself to confess--\nnot for worlds would she let the school know of her cowardice and shame.\nNo, if there was no other means of clearing: Annie except through her\nconfession, she must remain with the shadow of this sin over her to her\ndying day.\n\nHester, however, was now really unhappy, and also truly sorry for poor\nAnnie.  Could she have got off without disgrace or punishment, she would\nhave been truly glad to see Annie exonerated.  She was quite certain\nthat Susan Drummond was at the bottom of all the mischief which had been\ndone lately at Lavender House.  She could not make out how stupid Susan\nwas clever enough to caricature and to imitate peoples' hands.  Still\nshe was convinced that she was the guilty person, and she wondered and\nwondered if she could induce Susan to come forward and confess the\ntruth, and so save Annie without bringing her, Hester, into any trouble.\n\nShe resolved to speak to Susan, and without confessing that she had been\nin the school-room on the night the essay was changed, to let her know\nplainly that she suspected her.\n\nShe became much calmer when she determined to carry out this resolve,\nand toward morning she fell asleep.\n\nShe was awakened at a very early hour by little Nan clambering over the\nside of her crib, and cuddling down cosily in a way she loved by\nHester's side.\n\n\"Me so 'nug, 'nug,\" said little Nan.  \"Oh, Hetty, Hetty, there's a wy on\nthe teiling!\"\n\nHester had then to rouse herself, and enter into an animated\nconversation on the subject of flies generally, and in especial she had\nto talk of that particular fly which would perambulate on the ceiling\nover Nan's head.\n\n\"Me like wies,\" said Nan, \"and me like 'oo, Hetty, and me love--me love\nAnnie.\"\n\nHester kissed her little sister passionately; but this last observation,\naccompanied by the expression of almost angelic devotion which filled\nlittle Nan's brown eyes, as she repeated that she liked flies and Hetty,\nbut that she loved Annie, had the effect of again hardening her heart.\n\nHester's hour of trial, however, was at hand, and before that day was\nover she was to experience that awful emptiness and desolation which\nthose know whom God is punishing.\n\nLessons went on as usual at Lavender House that morning, and, to the\nsurprise of several, Annie was seen in her old place in class.  She\nworked with a steadiness quite new to her; no longer interlarding her\nhours of study with those indescribable glances of fun and mischief,\nfirst at one school-companion and then at another, which used to worry\nher teachers so much.\n\nThere were no merry glances from Annie that morning: but she worked\nsteadily and rapidly, and went through that trying ordeal, her French\nverbs, with such satisfaction that Mademoiselle was on the point of\npraising her, until she remembered that Annie was in disgrace.\n\nAfter school, however, Annie did not join her companions in the grounds,\nbut went up to her bedroom, where, by Mrs Willis's orders, she was to\nremain until the girls went in.  She was to take her own exercise later\nin the day.\n\nIt was now the tenth of June--an intensely sultry day; a misty heat\nbrooded over everything, and not a breath of air stirred the leaves in\nthe trees.  The girls wandered about languidly, too enervated by the\nheat to care to join in any noisy games.  They were now restored to\ntheir full freedom, and there is no doubt they enjoyed the privileges of\nhaving little confabs, and whispering secrets to each other without\nhaving Miss Good and Miss Danesbury for ever at their elbows.  They\ntalked of many things--of the near approach of the holidays, of the\nprize day which was now so close at hand, of Annie's disgrace, and so\non.\n\nThey wondered, many of them, if Annie would ever be brought to confess\nher sin, and, if not, how Mrs Willis would act toward her.  Dora\nRussell said in her most contemptuous tones--\n\n\"She is nothing, after all, but a charity child, and Mrs Willis has\nsupported her for years for nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes, and she's too clever by half; eh, poor old Muddy Stream?\" remarked\na saucy little girl.  \"By the way, Dora, dear, how goes the river now?--\nhas it lost itself in the arms of mother ocean yet?\"\n\nDora turned red and walked away, and her young tormentor exclaimed with\nconsiderable gusto--\n\n\"There, I have silenced her for a bit; I do hate the way she talks about\ncharity children.  Whatever her faults, Annie is the sweetest and\nprettiest girl in the school, in my opinion.\"  In the meantime Hester\nwas looking in all directions for Susan Drummond.  She thought the\npresent a very fitting opportunity to open her attack on her, and she\nwas the more anxious to bring her to reason as a certain look in Annie's\nface--a pallid and very weary look--had gone to her heart, and touched\nher in spite of herself.  Now, even though little Nan loved her, Hester\nwould save Annie could she do so not at her own expense.\n\nLook, however, as she would, nowhere could she find Miss Drummond.  She\ncalled and called, but no sleepy voice replied.  Susan, indeed, knew\nbetter; she had curled herself up in a hammock which hung between the\nboughs of a shady tree, and though Hester passed under her very head,\nshe was sucking lollipops and going off comfortably into the land of\ndreams, and had no intention of replying.  Hester wandered down the\nshady walk, and at its farther end she was gratified by the sight of\nlittle Nan, who, under her nurse's charge, was trying to string daisies\non the grass.  Hester sat down by her side, and Nan climbed over and\nmade fine havoc of her neat print dress, and laughed, and was at her\nmerriest and best.\n\n\"I hear say that that naughty Miss Forest has done something out-and-out\ndisgraceful,\" whispered the nurse.\n\n\"Oh, don't!\" said Hester impatiently.  \"Why should everyone throw mud at\na girl when she is down?  If poor Annie is naughty and guilty, she is\nsuffering now.\"\n\n\"Annie _not_ naughty,\" said little Nan.  \"Me love my own Annie; me do,\nme do.\"\n\n\"And you love your own poor old nurse, too?\" responded the somewhat\njealous nurse.\n\nHester left the two playing happily together, the little one caressing\nher nurse, and blowing one or two kisses after her sister's retreating\nform.  Hester returned to the house, and went up to her room to prepare\nfor dinner.  She had washed her hands, and was standing before the\nlooking-glass re-plaiting her long hair when Susan Drummond, looking\nextremely wild and excited, and with her eyes almost starting out of her\nhead, rushed into the room.\n\n\"Oh, Hester, Hester!\" she gasped, and she flung herself on Hester's bed,\nwith her face downwards; she seemed absolutely deprived for the moment\nof the power of any further speech.\n\n\"What is the matter, Susan?\" inquired Hester half impatiently.  \"What\nhave you come into my room for?  Are you going into a fit of hysterics?\nYou had better control yourself, for the dinner gong will sound\ndirectly.\"\n\nSusan gasped two or three times, made a rush to Hester's wash-handstand,\nand taking up a glass, poured some cold water into it, and gulped it\ndown.\n\n\"Now I can speak,\" she said.  \"I ran so fast that my breath quite left\nme.  Hester, put on your walking things or go without them, just as you\nplease--only go at once if you would save her.\"\n\n\"Save whom?\" asked Hester.\n\n\"Your little sister--little Nan.  I--I saw it all.  I was in the\nhammock, and nobody knew I was there, and somehow I wasn't so sleepy as\nusual, and I heard Nan's voice, and I looked over the side of the\nhammock, and she was sitting on the grass picking daisies, and her nurse\nwas with her, and presently you came up.  I heard you calling me, but I\nwasn't going to answer.  I felt too comfortable.  You stayed with Nan\nand her nurse for a little, and then went away; and I heard Nan's nurse\nsay to her: `Sit here, Missy, till I come back to you; I am going to\nfetch another reel of sewing cotton from the house.  Sit still, Missy;\nI'll be back directly.'  She went away, and Nan went on picking her\ndaisies.  All on a sudden I heard Nan give a sharp little cry, and I\nlooked over the hammock, and there was a tall dark woman, with such a\nwicked face, and she snatched up Nan in her arms, and put a thick shawl\nover her face, and ran off with her.  It was all done in an instant.  I\nshouted, and I scrambled out of the hammock, and I rushed down the path;\nbut there wasn't a sign of anybody there.  I don't know where the woman\nwent--it seemed as if the earth swallowed up both her and little Nan.\nWhy, Hester, are you going to faint?\"\n\n\"Water!\" gasped Hester--\"one sip--now let me go.\"\n\nCHAPTER 40. A GIPSY MAID.\n\nIn a few moments everyone in Lavender House was made acquainted with\nSusan's story.  At such a time ceremony was laid aside, dinner\nforgotten, teachers, pupils, servants all congregated in the grounds,\nall rushed to the spot where Nan's withered daisies still lay, all\npeered through the underwood, and all, alas! looked, in vain for the\ntall dark woman and the little child.  Little Nan, the baby of the\nschool, had been stolen--there were loud and terrified lamentations.\nNan's nurse was almost tearing her hair, was rushing frantically here,\nthere, and everywhere.  No one blamed the nurse for leaving her little\ncharge in apparent safety for a few moments, but the poor woman's own\ndistress was pitiable to see.  Mrs Willis took Hester's hand, and told\nthe poor stunned girl that she was sending to Sefton immediately for two\nor three policemen, and that in the meantime every man on the place\nshould commence the search for the woman and child.\n\n\"Without any doubt,\" Mrs Willis added, \"we shall soon have our little\nNan back again; it is quite impossible that the woman, whoever she is,\ncan have taken her so far away in so short a time.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Annie in her bedroom heard the fuss and the noise.  She\nleaned out of her window and saw Phyllis in the distance; she called to\nher.  Phyllis ran up, the tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\n\"Oh, something so dreadful!\" she gasped; \"a wicked, wicked woman has\nstolen little Nan Thornton.  She ran off with her just where the\nundergrowth is so thick at the end of the shady walk.  It happened to\nher half an hour ago, and they are all looking, but they cannot find the\nwoman or little Nan anywhere.  Oh, it is so dreadful!  Is that you,\nMary?\"\n\nPhyllis ran off to join her sister, and Annie put her head in again, and\nlooked round her pretty room.\n\n\"The gipsy,\" she murmured, \"the tall, dark gipsy has taken little Nan!\"\n\nHer face was very white, her eyes shone, her lips expressed a firm and\nalmost obstinate determination.  With all her usual impulsiveness, she\ndecided on a course of action--she snatched up a piece of paper and\nscribbled a hasty line:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Dear Mother-friend,--However badly you think of Annie, Annie loves you\nwith all her heart.  Forgive me, I must go myself to look for little\nNan.  That tall, dark woman is a gipsy--I have seen her before; her name\nis Mother Rachel.  Tell Hetty I won't return until I bring her little\nsister back.--Your repentant and sorrowful Annie.\"\n\nAnnie twisted up the note, directed it to Mrs Willis, and left it on\nher dressing-table.\n\nThen, with a wonderful amount of forethought for her, she emptied the\ncontents of a little purse into a tiny gingham bag, which she fastened\ninside the front of her dress.  She put on her shady hat, and threw a\nshawl across her arm, and then, slipping softly downstairs, she went out\nthrough the deserted kitchens, down the back avenue, and past the\nlaurel-bush, until she came to the stile which led into the wood--she\nwas going straight to the gipsies' encampment.\n\nAnnie, with some of the gipsy's characteristics in her own blood, had\nalways taken an extraordinary interest in these queer wandering people.\nGipsies had a fascination for her, she loved stories about them; if a\ngipsy encampment was near, she always begged the teachers to walk in\nthat direction.  Annie had a very vivid imagination, and in the days\nwhen she reigned as favourite in the school she used to make up stories\nfor the express benefit of her companions.  These stories, as a rule,\nalways turned upon the gipsies.  Many and many a time had the girls of\nLavender House almost gasped with horror as Annie described the queer\nways of these people.  For her, personally, their wildness and their\nfreedom had a certain fascination, and she was heard in her gayest\nmoments to remark that she would rather like to be stolen and adopted by\na gipsy tribe.\n\nWhenever Annie had an opportunity she chatted with the gipsy wives, and\nallowed them to tell her fortune, and listened eagerly to their\nnarratives.  When a little child she had once for several months been\nunder the care of a nurse who was a reclaimed gipsy, and this girl had\ngiven her all kinds of information about them.  Annie often felt that\nshe quite loved these wild people, and Mother Rachel was the first gipsy\nshe cordially shrank from and disliked.\n\nWhen the little girl started now on her wild-goose chase after Nan she\nwas by no means devoid of a plan of action.  The knowledge she had taken\nso many years to acquire came to her aid, and she determined to use it\nfor Nan's benefit.  She knew that the gipsies, with all their wandering\nand erratic habits, had a certain attachment, if not for homes, at least\nfor sites; she knew that as a rule they encamped over and over again in\nthe same place; she knew that their wanderings were conducted with\nmethod, and their apparently lawless lives governed by strict self-made\nrules.\n\nAnnie made straight now for the encampment, which stood in a little dell\nat the other side of the fairies' field.  Here for weeks past the\ngipsies' tents had been seen; here the gipsy children had played, and\nthe men and women smoked and lain about in the sun.\n\nAnne entered the small field now, but uttered no exclamation of surprise\nwhen she found that all the tents, with the exception of one, had been\nremoved, and that this tent also was being rapidly taken down by a man\nand a girl, while a tall boy stood by, holding a donkey by the bridle.\n\nAnnie wasted no time in looking for Nan here.  Before the girl and the\nman could see her, she darted behind a bush, and removing her little bag\nof money, hid it carefully under some long grass; then she pulled a very\nbright yellow sash out of her pocket, tied it round her blue cotton\ndress, and leaving her little shawl also on the ground, tripped gayly up\nto the tent.\n\nShe saw with pleasure that the girl who was helping the man was about\nher own size.  She went up and touched her on the shoulder.\n\n\"Look here,\" she said, \"I want to make such a pretty play by-and-by--I\nwant to play that I'm a gipsy girl.  Will you give me your clothes, if I\ngive you mine?  See, mine are neat, and this sash is very handsome.\nWill you have them?  Do.  I am so anxious to play at being a gipsy.\"\n\nThe girl turned and stared.  Annie's pretty blue print and gay sash were\ncertainly tempting bait.  She glanced at her father.\n\n\"The little lady wants to change,\" she said in an eager voice.\n\nThe man nodded acquiescence, and the girl taking Annie's hand, ran\nquickly with her to the bottom of the field.\n\n\"You don't mean it, surely?\" she said.  \"Eh, but I'm uncommon willing.\"\n\n\"Yes, I certainly mean it,\" said Annie.  \"You are a dear, good, obliging\ngirl, and how nice you will look in my pretty blue cotton!  I like that\nstriped petticoat of yours, too, and that gay handkerchief you wear\nround your shoulders.  Thank you so very much.  Now, do I look like a\nreal, real gipsy?\"\n\n\"Your hair ain't ragged enough, miss.\"\n\n\"Oh, clip it, then; clip it away.  I want to be quite the real thing.\nHave you got a pair of scissors?\"\n\nThe girl ran back to the tent, and presently returned to shear poor\nAnnie's beautiful hair in truly rough fashion.\n\n\"Now, miss, you look much more like, only your arms are a bit too white.\nStay, we has got some walnut-juice; we was just a-using of it.  I'll\ntouch you up fine, miss.\"\n\nSo she did, darkening Annie's brown skin to a real gipsy tone.\n\n\"You're, a dear, good girl,\" said Annie, in conclusion; and as the\ngirl's father called her roughly at this moment, she was obliged to go\naway, looking ungainly enough in the English child's neat clothes.\n\nCHAPTER 41. DISGUISED.\n\nAnnie ran out of the field, mounted the stile which led into the wood,\nand stood there until the gipsy man and girl, and the boy with the\ndonkey, had finally disappeared.  Then she left her hiding-place, and\ntaking her little gingham bag out of the long grass, secured it once\nmore in the front of her dress.  She felt queer and uncomfortable in her\nnew dress, and the gipsy girl's heavy shoes tired her feet; but she was\nnot to be turned from her purpose by any manner of discomforts, and she\nstarted bravely on her long trudge over the dusty roads, for her object\nwas to follow the gipsies to their next encampment, about ten miles\naway.  She had managed, with some tact, to obtain a certain amount of\ninformation from the delighted gipsy girl.  The girl told Annie that she\nwas very glad they were going from here; that this was a very dull\nplace, and that they would not have stayed so long but for Mother\nRachel, who for some reasons of her own, had refused to stir.\n\nHere the girl drew herself up short, and coloured under her dark skin.\nBut Annie's tact never failed.  She even yawned a little, and seemed\nscarcely to hear the girl's words.\n\nNow, in the distance, she followed these people.\n\nIn her disguise, uncomfortable as it was, she felt tolerably safe.\nShould any of the people in Lavender House happen to pass her on the\nway, they would never recognise Annie Forest in this small gipsy maiden.\nWhen she did approach the gipsies' dwelling she might have some hope of\npassing as one of themselves.  The only one whom she had really to fear\nwas the girl with whom she had changed clothes, and she trusted to her\nwits to keep out of this young person's way.\n\nWhen Zillah, her old gipsy nurse, had charmed her long ago with gipsy\nlegends and stories, Annie had always begged to hear about the fair\nEnglish children whom the gipsies stole, and Zillah had let her into\nsome secrets which partly accounted for the fact that so few of these\nchildren are ever recovered.\n\nShe walked very fast now; her depression was gone, a great excitement, a\ngreat longing, a great hope, keeping her up.  She forgot that she had\neaten nothing since breakfast: she forgot everything in all the world\nnow but her great love for little Nan, and her desire to lay down her\nvery life, if necessary, to rescue Nan from the terrible fate which\nawaited her if she was brought up as a gipsy's child.\n\nAnnie, however, was unaccustomed to such long walks, and besides, recent\nevents had weakened her, and by the time she reached Sefton--for her\nroad lay straight through this little town--she was so hot and thirsty\nthat she looked around her anxiously to find some place of refreshment.\n\nIn an unconscious manner she paused before a restaurant, where she and\nseveral other girls of Lavender House had more than once been regaled\nwith buns and milk.\n\nThe remembrance of the fresh milk and the nice buns came gratefully\nbefore the memory of the tired child now.  Forgetting her queer attire,\nshe went into the shop, and walked boldly up to the counter.\n\nAnnie's disguise, however, was good, and the young woman who was\nserving, instead of bending forward with the usual gracious \"What can I\nget for you, miss?\" said very sharply--\n\n\"Go away at once, little girl; we don't allow beggars here; leave the\nshop instantly.  No, I have nothing for you.\"\n\nAnnie was about to reply rather hotly, for she had an idea that even a\ngipsy's money might purchase buns and milk, when she was suddenly\nstartled, and almost terrified into betraying herself, by encountering\nthe gentle and fixed stare of Miss Jane Bruce, who had been leaning over\nthe counter and talking to one of the shop-women when Annie entered.\n\n\"Here is a penny for you, little girl,\" she said.  \"You can get a nice\nhunch of stale bread for a penny in the shop at the corner of the High\nStreet.\"\n\nAnnie's eyes flashed back at the little lady, her lips quivered, and,\nclasping the penny, she rushed out of the shop.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Miss Jane, turning to her sister, \"did you notice the\nextraordinary likeness that little gipsy girl bore to Annie Forest?\"\n\nMiss Agnes sighed.  \"Not particularly, love,\" she answered; \"but I\nscarcely looked at her.  I wonder if our dear little Annie is any\nhappier than she was.  Ah, I think we have done here.  Good afternoon,\nMrs Tremlett.\"\n\nThe little old ladies, trotted off, giving no more thoughts to the gipsy\nchild.\n\nPoor Annie almost ran down the street, and never paused till she reached\na shop of much humbler appearance, where she was served with some cold\nslices of German sausage, some indifferent bread and butter, and milk by\nno means over-good.  The coarse fare, and the rough people who\nsurrounded her, made the poor child feel both sick and frightened.  She\nfound she could only keep up her character by remaining almost silent,\nfor the moment she opened her lips people turned round and stared at\nher.\n\nShe paid for her meal, however, and presently found herself at the other\nside of Sefton, and in a part of the country which was comparatively\nstrange to her.  The gipsies' present encampment was about a mile away\nfrom the town of Oakley, a much larger place than Sefton.  Sefton and\nOakley lay about six miles apart.  Annie trudged bravely on, her head\naching; for, of course, as a gipsy girl, she could use no parasol to\nshade her from the sun.  At last the comparative cool of the evening\narrived, and the little girl gave a sigh of relief, and looked forward\nto her bed and supper at Oakley.  She had made up her mind to sleep\nthere, and to go to the gipsies' encampment very early in the morning.\nIt was quite dark by the time she reached Oakley, and she was now so\ntired, and her feet so blistered from walking in the gipsy girl's rough\nshoes, that she could scarcely proceed another step.  The noise and the\nsize of Oakley, too, bewildered and frightened her.  She had learnt a\nlesson in Sefton, and dared not venture into the more respectable\nstreets.  How could she sleep in those hot, common, close houses?\nSurely it would be better for her to lie down under a cool hedge-row--\nthere could be no real cold on this lovely summer's night, and the hours\nwould quickly pass, and the time soon arrive when she must go boldly in\nsearch of Nan.  She resolved to sleep in a hayfield which took her fancy\njust outside the town, and she only went into Oakley for the purpose of\nbuying some bread and milk.\n\nAnnie was so far fortunate as to get a refreshing draught of really good\nmilk from a woman who stood by a cottage door, and who gave her a piece\nof girdle-cake to eat with it.\n\n\"You're one of the gipsies, my dear?\" said the woman.  \"I saw them\npassing in their caravans an hour back.  No doubt you are for taking up\nyour old quarters in the copse, just alongside of Squire Thompson's long\nacre field.  How is it you are not with the rest of them, child?\"\n\n\"I was late in starting,\" said Annie.  \"Can you tell me the best way to\nget from here to the long acre field?\"\n\n\"Oh! you take that turn-stile, child, and keep in the narrow path by the\ncornfields; it's two miles and a half from here as the crow flies.  No,\nno, my dear, I don't want your pennies; but you might humour my little\ngirl here by telling her fortune--she's wonderful taken by the gipsy\nfolk.\"\n\nAnnie coloured painfully.  The child came forward, and she crossed her\nhand with a piece of silver.  She looked at the little palm and muttered\nsomething about being rich and fortunate, and marrying a prince in\ndisguise, and having no trouble whatever.\n\n\"Eh! but that's a fine lot, is yours, Peggy,\" said the gratified mother.\n\nPeggy however, aged nine, had a wiser head on her young shoulders.\n\n\"She didn't tell no proper fortune,\" she said disparagingly, when Annie\nleft the cottage.  \"She didn't speak about no crosses, and no biting\ndisappointments, and no bleeding wounds.  I don't believe in her, I\ndon't.  I like fortunes mixed, not all one way; them fortunes ain't\nnatural, and I don't believe she's no proper gipsy girl.\"\n\nCHAPTER 42. HESTER.\n\nAt Lavender House the confusion, the terror, and the dismay were great.\nFor several hours the girls seemed quite to lose their heads, and just\nwhen, under Mrs Willis's and the other teachers' calmness and\ndetermination, they were being restored to discipline and order, the\nexcitement and alarm broke out afresh when some one brought Annie's\nlittle note to Mrs Willis, and the school discovered that she also was\nmissing.\n\nOn this occasion no one did doubt her motives; disobedient as her act\nwas, no one wasted words of blame on her.  All, from the head-mistress\nto the smallest child in the school, knew that it was love for little\nNan that had taken Annie off; and the tears started to Mrs Willis's\neyes when she first read the tiny note, and then placed it tenderly in,\nher desk.  Hester's face became almost ashen in its hue when she heard\nwhat Annie had done.\n\n\"Annie has gone herself to bring back Nan to you, Hester,\" said Phyllis.\n\"It was I told her, and I know now by her face that she must have made\nup her mind at once.\"\n\n\"Very disobedient of her to go,\" said Dora Russell; but no one took up\nDora's tone, and Mary Price said, after a pause--\n\n\"Disobedient or not, it was brave--it was really very plucky.\"\n\n\"It is my opinion,\" said Nora, \"that if anyone in the world can find\nlittle Nan it will be Annie.  You remember.  Phyllis, how often she has\ntalked to us about gipsies, and what a lot she knows about them?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; she'll be better than fifty policemen,\" echoed several girls;\nand then two or three young faces were turned toward Hester, and some\nvoice said almost scornfully--\"You'll have to love Annie now; you'll\nhave to admit that there is something good in our Annie when she brings\nyour little Nan home again.\"\n\nHester's lips quivered; she tried to speak, but a sudden burst of tears\ncame from her instead.  She walked slowly out of the astonished little\ngroup, who none of them believed that proud Hester Thornton could weep.\n\nThe wretched girl rushed up to her room, where she threw herself on her\nbed and gave way to some of the bitterest tears she had ever shed.  All\nher indifference to Annie, all her real unkindness, all her\never-increasing dislike came back now to torture and harass her.  She\nbegan to believe with the girls that Annie would be successful; she\nbegan dimly to acknowledge in her heart the strange power which this\nchild possessed; she guessed that Annie would heap coals of fire on her\nhead by bringing back her little sister.  She hoped, she longed, she\ncould almost have found it in her heart to pray that some one else, not\nAnnie, might save little Nan.\n\nFor not yet had Hester made up her mind to confess the truth about Annie\nForest.  To confess the truth now meant humiliation in the eyes of the\nwhole school.  Even for Nan's sake she could not, she would not, be\ngreat enough for this.\n\nSobbing on her bed, trembling from head to foot, in an agony of almost\nuncontrollable grief, she could not bring her proud and stubborn little\nheart to accept God's only way of piece.  No, she hoped she might be\nable to influence Susan Drummond and induce her to confess, and if Annie\nwas not cleared in that way, if she really saved little Nan, she would\ndoubtless be restored to much of her lost favour in the school.\n\nHester had never been a favourite at Lavender House; but now her great\ntrouble caused all the girls to speak to her kindly and considerately,\nand as she lay on her bed she presently heard a gentle step on the floor\nof her room--a cool little hand was laid tenderly on her forehead, and\nopening her swollen eyes, she met Cecil's loving gaze.\n\n\"There is no news yet, Hester,\" said Cecil; \"but Mrs Willis has just\ngone herself into Sefton, and will not lose an hour in getting further\nhelp.  Mrs Willis looks quite haggard.  Of course she is very anxious\nboth about Annie and Nan.\"\n\n\"Oh, Annie is safe enough,\" murmured Hester, burying her head in the\nbedclothes.\n\n\"I don't know; Annie is very impulsive, and very pretty; the gipsies may\nlike to steal her too--of course she has gone straight to one of their\nencampments.  Naturally Mrs Willis is most anxious.\"\n\nHester pressed her hand to her throbbing head.\n\n\"We are all so sorry for you, dear,\" said Cecil gently.\n\n\"Thank you--being sorry for one does not do a great deal of good, does\nit?\"\n\n\"I thought sympathy always did good,\" replied Cecil, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hester again.  She lay quite still for several minutes\nwith her eyes closed.  Her face looked intensely unhappy.  Cecil was not\neasily repelled, and she guessed only too surely that Hester's proud\nheart was suffering much.  She was puzzled, however, how to approach\nher, and had almost made up her mind to go away and beg of kind-hearted\nMiss Danesbury to see if she could come and do something, when through\nthe open window there came the shrill sweet laughter and the eager,\nhigh-pitched tones of some of the youngest children in the school.  A\nstrange quiver passed over Hester's face at the sound; she sat up in\nbed, and gasped out in a half-strangled voice--\n\n\"Oh!  I can't bear it--little Nan, little Nan!  Cecil, I am very, very\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"I know it, darling,\" said Cecil, and she put her arms round the excited\ngirl.  \"Oh, Hester! don't turn away from me; do let us be unhappy\ntogether.\"\n\n\"But you did not care for Nan.\"\n\n\"I did--we all loved the pretty darling.\"\n\n\"Suppose I never see her again?\" said Hester half wildly.  \"Oh, Cecil!\nand mother left her to me! mother gave her to me to take care of, and to\nbring to her some day in heaven.  Oh, little Nan, my pretty, my love, my\nsweet!  I think I could better bear her being dead than this.\"\n\n\"You could, Hester,\" said Cecil, \"if she was never to be found; but I\ndon't think God will give you such a terrible punishment.  I think\nlittle Nan will be restored to you.  Let us ask God to do it, Hetty--let\nus kneel down now, we two little girls, and pray to Him with all our\nmight.\"\n\n\"I can't pray; don't ask me,\" said Hester, turning her face away.\n\n\"Then I will.\"\n\n\"But not here, Cecil.  Cecil, I am not good--I am not good enough to\npray.\"\n\n\"We don't want to be good to pray,\" said Cecil.  \"We want perhaps to be\nunhappy--perhaps sorry; but if God waited just for goodness, I don't\nthink He would get many prayers.\"\n\n\"Well, I am unhappy, but not sorry.  No, no; don't ask me, I cannot\npray.\"\n\nCHAPTER 43. SUSAN.\n\nMrs Willis came back at a very late hour from Sefton.  The police were\nconfident that they must soon discover both children, but no tidings had\nyet been heard of either of them.  Mrs Willis ordered her girls to bed,\nand went herself to kiss Hester and give her a special \"good-night.\"\nShe was struck by the peculiarly unhappy, and even hardened, expression\non the poor child's face, and felt that she did not half understand her.\n\nIn the middle of the night Hester awoke from a troubled dream.  She\nawoke with a sharp cry, so sharp and intense in its sound that had any\ngirl been awake in the next room she must have heard it.  She felt that\nshe could no longer remain close to that little empty cot.  She suddenly\nremembered that Susan Drummond would be alone to-night: what time so\ngood as the present for having a long talk with Susan and getting her to\nclear Annie?  She slipped out of bed, put on her dressing-gown, and\nsoftly opening the door, ran down the passage to Susan's room.\n\nSusan was in bed, and fast asleep.  Hester could see her face quite\nplainly in the moonlight, for Susan slept facing the window, and the\nblind was not drawn down.\n\nHester had some difficulty in awakening Miss Drummond, who, however, at\nlast sat up in bed, yawning prodigiously.\n\n\"What is the matter?  Is that you, Hester Thornton?  Have you got any\nnews of little Nan?  Has Annie come back?\"\n\n\"No, they are both still away.  Susy, I want to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Dear me! what for? must you speak in the middle of the night?\"\n\n\"Yes, for I don't want anyone else to know.  Oh, Susan, please don't go\nto sleep.\"\n\n\"My dear, I won't, if I can help it.  Do you mind throwing a little cold\nwater over my face and head?  There is a can by the bed-side.  I always\nkeep one handy.  Ah, thanks--now I am wide awake.  I shall probably\nremain so for about two minutes.  Can you get your say over in that\ntime?\"\n\n\"I wonder, Susan,\" said Hester, \"if you have got any heart--but heart or\nnot, I have just come here to-night to tell you that I have found you\nout.  You are at the bottom of all this mischief about Annie Forest.\"\n\nSusan had a most phlegmatic face, an utterly unemotional voice, and she\nnow stared calmly at Hester and demanded to know what in the world she\nmeant.\n\nHester felt her temper going, her self-control deserting her.  Susan's\napparent innocence and indifference drove her half frantic.\n\n\"Oh, you are mean,\" she said.  \"You pretend to be innocent, but you are\nthe deepest and wickedest girl in the school.  I tell you, Susan, I have\nfound you out--you put that caricature of Mrs Willis into Cecil's book;\nyou changed Dora's theme.  I don't know why you did it, nor how you did\nit, but you are the guilty person, and you have allowed the sin of it to\nremain on Annie's shoulders all this time.  Oh, you are the very meanest\ngirl I ever heard of!\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Susan, \"I wish I had not asked you to throw cold\nwater over my head and face, and allow myself to be made very wet and\nuncomfortable, just to be told I am the meanest girl you ever met.  And\npray what affair is this of yours?  You certainly don't love Annie\nForest.\"\n\n\"I don't, but I want justice to be done to her.  Annie is very, very\nunhappy.  Oh, Susy, won't you go and tell Mrs Willis the truth?\"\n\n\"Really, my dear Hester, I think you are a little mad.  How long have\nyou known all this about me, pray?\"\n\n\"Oh, for some time since--since the night the essay was changed.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, if what you stale is true, you told Mrs Willis a lie, for\nshe distinctly asked you if you knew anything about the `Muddy Stream,'\nand you said you didn't.  I saw you--I remarked how very red you got\nwhen you plumped out that great lie!  My dear, if I am the meanest and\nwickedest girl in the school, prove it--go, tell Mrs Willis what you\nknow.  Now, if you will allow me, I will get back into the land of\ndreams.\"\n\nSusan curled herself up once more in her bed, wrapped the bedclothes\ntightly round her, and was to all appearance oblivious of Hester's\npresence.\n\nCHAPTER 44. UNDER THE HEDGE.\n\nIt is one thing to talk of the delights of sleeping under a hedge-row\nand another to realise them.  A hayfield is a very charming place, but\nin the middle of the night, with the dew clinging to everything, it is\napt to prove but a chilly bed; the most familiar objects put on strange\nand unreal forms, the most familiar sounds become loud and alarming.\nAnnie slept for about an hour soundly; then she awoke, trembling with\ncold in every limb, startled and almost terrified by the oppressive\nloneliness of the night, sure that the insect life which surrounded her,\nand which would keep up successions of chirps, and croaks, and buzzes,\nwas something mysterious and terrifying.  Annie was a brave child, but\neven brave little girls may be allowed to possess nerves under her\npresent conditions, and when a spider ran across her face she started up\nwith a scream of terror.  At this moment she almost regretted the close\nand dirty lodgings which she might have obtained for a few pence at\nOakley.  The hay in the field which she had selected was partly cut and\npartly standing.  The cut portion had been piled up into little cocks\nand hillocks, and these, with the night shadows round them, appeared to\nthe frightened child to assume large and half-human proportions.  She\nfound she could not sleep any longer.  She wrapped her shawl tightly\nround her, and, crouching into the hedge-row, waited for the dawn.\n\nThat watched-for dawn seemed to the tired child as if it would never\ncome; but at last her solitary vigil came to an end, the cold grew\ngreater, a little gentle breeze stirred the uncut grass, and up in the\nsky overhead the stars became fainter and the atmosphere clearer.  Then\ncame a little faint flush of pink, then a brighter light, and then all\nin a moment the birds burst into a perfect jubilee of song, the insects\ntalked and chirped and buzzed in new tones, the hay-cocks became simply\nhay-cocks, the dew sparkled on the wet grass, the sun had risen, and the\nnew day had begun.\n\nAnnie sat up and rubbed her tired eyes.  With the sunshine and\nbrightness her versatile spirits revived; she buckled on her courage\nlike an armour, and almost laughed at the miseries of the past few\nhours.  Once more she believed that success and victory would be hers,\nonce more in her small way she was ready to do or die.  She believed\nabsolutely in the holiness of her mission.  Love--love alone simple and\npure, was guiding her.  She gave no thought to after-consequences, she\ngave no memory to past events: her object now was to rescue Nan, and she\nherself was nothing.\n\nAnnie had a fellow-feeling, a rare sympathy with every little child; but\nno child had ever come to take Nan's place with her.  The child she had\nfirst begun to notice simply out of a naughty spirit of revenge, had\ntwined herself round her heart, and Annie loved Nan all the more dearly\nbecause she had long ago repented of stealing her affections from\nHester, and would gladly have restored her to her old place next to\nHetty's heart.  Her love for Nan, therefore, had the purity and\ngreatness which all love that calls forth self-sacrifice must possess.\nAnnie had denied herself, and kept away from Nan of late.  Now, indeed,\nshe was going to rescue her; but if she thought of herself at all, it\nwas with the certainty that for this present act of disobedience Mrs\nWillis would dismiss her from the school, and she would not see little\nNan again.\n\nNever mind that, if Nan herself was saved.  Annie was disobedient, but\non this occasion she was not unhappy; she had none of that remorse which\ntroubled her so much after her wild picnic in the fairies' field.  On\nthe contrary, she had a strange sense of peace and even guidance; she\nhad confessed this sin to Mrs Willis, and, though she was suspected of\nfar worse, her own innocence kept her heart untroubled.  The verse which\nhad occurred to her two mornings before still rang in her ears--\n\n\"A soul which has sinned and is pardoned again.\"\n\nThe impulsive, eager child was possessed just now of something which men\ncall True Courage; it was founded on the knowledge that God would help\nher, and was accordingly calm and strengthening.\n\nAnnie rose from her damp bed, and looked around her for a little stream\nwhere she might wash her face and hands; suddenly she remembered that\nface and hands were dyed, and that she would do best to leave them\nalone.  She smoothed out as best she could the ragged elf-locks which\nthe gipsy maid had left on her curly head, and then, covering her face\nwith her hands, said simply and earnestly--\"Please, my Father in heaven,\nhelp me to find little Nan;\" then she set off through the cornfields in\nthe direction of the gipsies' encampment.\n\nCHAPTER 45. TIGER.\n\nIt was still very, very early in the morning, and the gipsy folk, tired\nfrom their march on the preceding day, slept.  There stood the conical,\nqueer-shaped tents, four in number; at a little distance off grazed the\ndonkeys and a couple of rough mules; at the door of the tents lay\nstretched out in profound repose two or three dogs.\n\nAnnie dreaded the barking of the dogs, although she guessed that if they\nset up a noise, and a gipsy wife or man put out their heads in\nconsequence, they would only desire the gipsy child to lie down and keep\nquiet.\n\nShe stood still for a moment--she was very anxious to prowl around the\nplace and examine the ground while the gipsies still slept, but the\nwatchful dogs deterred her.  She stood perfectly quiet behind the\nhedge-row, thinking hard.  Should she trust to a charm she knew she\npossessed, and venture into the encampment?  Annie had almost as great a\nfascination over dogs and cats as she had over children.  As a little\nchild going to visit with her mother at strange houses, the watch-dogs\nnever barked at her; on the contrary, they yielded to the charm which\nseemed to come from her little fingers as she patted their great heads.\nSlowly their tails would move backwards and forwards as she petted them,\nand even the most ferocious would look at her with affection.\n\nAnnie wondered if the gipsy dogs would now allow her to approach without\nbarking.  She felt that the chances were in her favour; she was dressed\nin gipsy garments, there would be nothing strange in her appearance, and\nif she could get near one of the dogs she knew that she could exercise\nthe magic of her touch.\n\nHer object, then, was to approach one of the tents very, very quietly--\nso softly that even the dog's ears should not detect the light footfall.\nIf she could approach close enough to put her hand on the dog's neck\nall would be well.  She pulled off the gipsy maid's rough shoes, hid\nthem in the grass where she could find them again, and came gingerly,\nstep by step, nearer and nearer the principal tent.  At its entrance lay\na ferocious-looking half-bred bull-dog.  Annie possessed that necessary\naccompaniment to courage--great outward calm; the greater the danger,\nthe more cool and self-possessed did she become.  She was within a step\nor two of the tent when she trod accidentally on a small twig: it\ncracked, giving her foot a sharp pain, and, very slight as the sound\nwas, causing the bull-dog to awake.  He raised his wicked face, saw the\nfigure like his own people, and yet unlike, but a step or two away, and,\nuttering a low growl, sprang forward.\n\nIn the ordinary course of things this growl would have risen in volume\nand would have terminated in a volley of barking; but Annie was\nprepared: she went down on her knees, held out her arms, said, \"Poor\nfellow!\" in her own seductive voice, and the bull-dog fawned at her\nfeet.  He licked one of her hands while she patted him gently with the\nother.\n\n\"Come, poor fellow,\" she said then in a gentle tone, and Annie and the\ndog began to perambulate round the tents.\n\nThe other dogs raised sleepy eyes, but seeing Tiger and the girl\ntogether, took no notice whatever, except by a thwack or two of their\nstumpy tails.  Annie was now looking not only at the tents, but for\nsomething else which Zillah, her nurse, had told her might be found near\nto many gipsy encampments.  This was a small subterranean passage, which\ngenerally led into a long-disused underground Danish fort.  Zillah had\ntold her what uses the gipsies liked to make of these underground\npassages, and how they often chose those which had two entrances.  She\ntold her that in this way they eluded the police, and were enabled\nsuccessfully to hide the goods which they stole.  She had also described\nto her their great ingenuity in hiding the entrances to these\nunderground retreats.\n\nAnnie's idea now was that little Nan was hidden in one of these vaults,\nand she determined first to make sure of its existence, and then to\nventure herself into this underground region in search of the lost\nchild.\n\nShe had made a decided conquest in the person of Tiger, who followed her\nround and round the tents, and when the gipsies at last began to stir\nand Annie crept into the hedge-row, the dog crouched by her side.  Tiger\nwas the favourite dog of the camp, and presently one of the men called\nto him; he rose unwillingly, looked back with longing eyes at Annie, and\ntrotted off, to return in the space of about five minutes with a great\nbunch of broken bread in his mouth.  This was his breakfast, and he\nmeant to share it with his new friend.  Annie was too hungry to be\nfastidious, and she also knew the necessity of keeping up her strength.\nShe crept still farther under the hedge, and the dog and girl shared the\nbroken bread between them.\n\nPresently the tents were all astir; the gipsy children began to swarm\nabout, the women lit fires in the open air, and the smell of very\nappetising breakfasts filled the atmosphere.  The men also lounged into\nview, standing lazily at the doors of their tents, and smoking great\npipes of tobacco.  Annie lay quiet.  She could see from her hiding-place\nwithout being seen.  Suddenly--and her eyes began to dilate, and she\nfound her heart beating strangely--she laid her hand on Tiger, who was\nquivering all over.\n\n\"Stay with me, dear dog,\" she said.\n\nThere was a great commotion and excitement in the gipsy camp; the\nchildren screamed and ran into the tents, the women paused in their\npreparation for breakfast, the men took their short pipes out of their\nmouths; every dog, with the exception of Tiger, barked ferociously.\nTiger and Annie alone were motionless.\n\nThe cause of all this uproar was a body of police, about six in number,\nwho came boldly into the field, and demanded instantly to search the\ntents.\n\n\"We want a woman who calls herself Mother Rachel,\" they said.  \"She\nbelongs to this encampment.  We know her: let her come forward at once;\nwe wish to question her.\"\n\nThe men stood about; the women came near; the children crept out of\ntheir tents, placing their fingers to their frightened lips, and staring\nat the men who represented those horrors to their unsophisticated minds\ncalled Law and Order.\n\n\"We must search the tents.  We won't stir from the spot until we have\nhad an interview with Mother Rachel,\" said the principal member of the\npolice force.\n\nThe men answered respectfully that the gipsy mother was not yet up; but\nif the gentlemen would wait a moment she would soon come and speak to\nthem.\n\nThe officers expressed their willingness to wait, and collected round\nthe tents.\n\nJust at this instant, under the hedge-row, Tiger raised his head.\nAnnie's watchful eyes accompanied the dog's.  He was gazing after a tiny\ngipsy maid who was skulking along the hedge, and who presently\ndisappeared through a very small opening into the neighbouring field.\n\nQuick as thought Annie, holding Tiger's collar, darted after her.  The\nlittle maid heard the footsteps: but seeing another gipsy girl, and\ntheir own dog, Tiger, she took no further notice, but ran openly and\nvery swiftly across the field until she came to a broken wall.  Here she\ntugged and tugged at some loose stones, managed to push one away, and\nthen called down into the ground--\n\n\"Mother Rachel!\"\n\n\"Come, Tiger,\" said Annie.  She flew to a hedge not far off, and once\nmore the dog and she hid themselves.  The small girl was too excited to\nnotice either their coming or going; she went on calling anxiously into\nthe ground--\n\n\"Mother Rachel!  Mother Rachel!\"\n\nPresently a black head and a pair of brawny shoulders appeared, and the\ntall woman whose face and figure Annie knew so well stepped up out of\nthe ground, pushed back the stones into their place, and, taking the\ngipsy child into her arms, ran swiftly across the field in the direction\nof the tents.\n\nCHAPTER 46. FOR LOVE OF NAN.\n\nNow was Annie's time.  \"Tiger,\" she said, for she had heard the men\ncalling the dog's name.  \"I want to go right down into that hole in the\nground, and you are to come with me.  Don't let us lose a moment, good\ndog.\"\n\nThe dog wagged his tail, capered about in front of Annie, and then with\na wonderful shrewdness ran before her to the broken wall, where he stood\nwith his head bent downwards and his eyes fixed on the ground.\n\nAnnie pulled and tugged at the loose stones; they were so heavy and so\ncunningly arranged that she wondered how the little maid, who was\nsmaller than herself, had managed to remove them.  She saw quickly,\nhowever, that they were arranged with a certain leverage, and that the\nlargest stone that which formed the real entrance to the underground\npassage, was balanced in its place in such a fashion that when she leant\non a certain portion of it, it moved aside, and allowed plenty of room\nfor her to go down into the earth.\n\nVery dark and dismal and uninviting did the rude steps, which led nobody\nknew where, appear.  For one moment Annie hesitated; but the thought of\nNan hidden somewhere in this awful wretchedness nerved her courage.\n\n\"Go first, Tiger, please,\" she said, and the dog scampered down,\nsniffing the earth as he went.  Annie followed him, but she had scarcely\ngot her head below the level of the ground before she found herself in\ntotal and absolute darkness; she had unwittingly touched the heavy\nstone, which had swung back into its place.  She heard Tiger sniffing\nbelow, and, calling to him to keep by her side, she went very carefully\ndown and down and down, until at last she knew by the increase of air\nthat she must have come to the end of the narrow entrance passage.\n\nShe was now able to stand upright, and raising her hand, she tried in\nvain to find a roof.  The room where she stood, then, must be lofty.\nShe went forward in the utter darkness very, very slowly; suddenly her\nhead again came in contact with the roof; she made a few steps farther\non, and then found that to proceed at all she must go on her hands and\nknees.  She bent down and peered through the darkness.\n\n\"We'll go on, Tiger,\" she said, and, holding the dog's collar and\nclinging to him for protection, she crept along the narrow passage.\n\nSuddenly she gave an exclamation of joy--at the other end of this gloomy\npassage was light--faint twilight surely, but still undoubted light,\nwhich came down from some chink in the outer world.  Annie came to the\nend of the passage, and, standing upright, found herself suddenly in a\nroom; a very small and miserable room, certainly, but with the twilight\nshining through it, which revealed not only that it was a room, but a\nroom which contained a heap of straw, a three-legged stool, and two or\nthree cracked cups and saucers.  Here, then, was Mother Rachel's lair,\nand here she must look for Nan.\n\nThe darkness had been so intense that even the faint twilight of this\nlittle chamber had dazzled Annie's eyes for a moment; the next, however,\nher vision became clear.  She saw that the straw bed contained a bundle;\nshe went near--out of the wrapped-up bundle of shawls appeared the head\nof a child.  The child slept, and moaned in its slumbers.\n\nAnnie bent over it and said, \"Thank God!\" in a tone of rapture, and\nthen, stooping down, she passionately kissed the lips of little Nan.\n\nNan's skin had been dyed with the walnut-juice, her pretty soft hair had\nbeen cut short, her dainty clothes had been changed for the most ragged\ngipsy garments, but still she was undoubtedly Nan, the child whom Annie\nhad come to save.\n\nFrom her uneasy slumbers the poor little one awoke with a cry of terror.\nShe could not recognise Annie's changed face, and clasped her hands\nbefore her eyes, and said piteously--\n\n\"Me want to go home--go 'way, naughty woman, me want my Annie.\"\n\n\"Little darling!\" said Annie, in her sweetest tones.  The changed face\nhad not appealed to Nan, but the old voice went straight to her baby\nheart; she stopped crying and looked anxiously toward the entrance of\nthe room.\n\n\"Turn in, Annie--me here, Annie--little Nan want 'oo.\"\n\nAnnie glanced around her in despair.  Suddenly her quick eyes lighted on\na jug of water.  She flew to it, and washed and laved her face.\n\n\"Coming, darling,\" she said, as she tried to remove the hateful dye.\nShe succeeded partly, and when she came back, to her great joy, the\nchild recognised her.\n\n\"Now, little precious, we will get out of this as fast as we can,\" said\nAnnie, and clasping Nan tightly in her arms, she prepared to return by\nthe way she had come.  Then and there, for the first time, there flashed\nacross her memory the horrible fact that the stone door had swung back\ninto its place, and that by no possible means could she open it.  She\nand Nan and Tiger were buried in a living tomb, and must either stay\nthere and perish, or await the tender mercies of the cruel Mother\nRachel.\n\nNan, with her arms tightly clasped round Annie's neck, began to cry\nfretfully.  She was impatient to get out of this dismal place; she was\nno longer oppressed by fears, for with the Annie whom she loved she felt\nabsolutely safe; but she was hungry and cold and uncomfortable, and it\nseemed but a step, to little inexperienced Nan, from Annie's arms to her\nsnug, cheerful nursery at Lavender House.\n\n\"Turn, Annie--turn home, Annie,\" she begged, and, when Annie did not\nstir, she began to weep.\n\nIn truth, the poor, brave little girl was sadly puzzled, and her first\ngleam of returning hope lay in the remembrance of Zillah's words, that\nthere were generally two entrances to these old underground forts.\nTiger, who seemed thoroughly at home in this little room, and had curled\nhimself up comfortably on the heap of straw, had probably often been\nhere before.  Perhaps Tiger knew the way to the second entrance.  Annie\ncalled him to her side.\n\n\"Tiger,\" she said, going down on her knees, and looking full into his\nugly but intelligent face, \"Nan and I want to go out of this.\"\n\nTiger wagged his stumpy tail.\n\n\"We are hungry, Tiger, and we want something to eat, and you'd like a\nbone, wouldn't you?\"\n\nTiger's tail went with ferocious speed, and he licked Annie's hand.\n\n\"There's no use going back that way, dear dog,\" continued the girl,\npointing with her arm in the direction they had come.  \"The door is\nfastened, Tiger, and we can't get out.  We can't get out because the\ndoor is shut.\"\n\nThe dog's tail had ceased to wag; he took in the situation, for his\nwhole expression showed dejection, and he drooped his head.\n\nIt was now quite evident to Annie that Tiger had been here before, and\nthat on some other occasion in his life he had wanted to get out and\ncould not because the door was shut.\n\n\"Now, Tiger,\" said Annie, speaking cheerfully, and rising to her feet,\n\"we must get out.  Nan and I are hungry, and you want your bone.  Take\nus out the other way, good Tiger--the other way, dear dog.\"\n\nShe moved instantly toward the little passage; the dog followed her.\n\n\"The other way,\" she said, and she turned her back on the long narrow\npassage, and took a step or two into complete darkness.  The dog began\nto whine, caught hold of her dress, and tried to pull her back.\n\n\"Quite right, Tiger, we won't go that way,\" said Annie instantly.  She\nreturned into the dimly-lighted room.\n\n\"Find a way--And a way out, Tiger,\" she said.\n\nThe dog evidently understood her; he moved restlessly about the room.\nFinally he got up on the bed, pulled and scratched and tore away the\nstraw at the upper end, then, wagging his tail, flew to Annie's side.\nShe came back with him.  Beneath the straw was a tiny, tiny trap-door.\n\n\"Oh, Tiger!\" said the girl; she went down on her knees, and, finding she\ncould not stir it, wondered if this also was kept in its place by a\nsystem of balancing.  She was right; after a very little pressing the\ndoor moved aside, and Annie saw four or five rudely carved steps.\n\n\"Come, Nan,\" she said joyfully, \"Tiger has saved us; these steps must\nlead us out.\"\n\nThe dog, with a joyful whine, went down first, and Annie, clasping Nan\ntightly in her arms, followed him.  Four, five, six steps they went\ndown; then, to Annie's great joy, she found that the next step began to\nascend.  Up and up she went, cheered by a welcome shaft of light.\nFinally she, Nan, and the dog found themselves emerging into the open\nair, through a hole which might have been taken for a large rabbit\nburrow.\n\nCHAPTER 47. RESCUED.\n\nThe girl, the child, and the dog found themselves in a comparatively\nstrange country--Annie had completely lost her bearings.  She looked\naround her for some sign of the gipsies' encampment; but whether she had\nreally gone a greater distance than she imagined in those underground\nvaults, or whether the tents were hidden in some hollow of the ground,\nshe did not know; she was only conscious that she was in a strange\ncountry, that Nan was clinging to her and crying for her breakfast, and\nthat Tiger was sniffing the air anxiously.  Annie guessed that Tiger\ncould take them back to the camp, but this was by no means her wish.\nWhen she emerged out of the underground passage she was conscious for\nthe first time of a strange and unknown experience.  Absolute terror\nseized the brave child: she trembled from head to foot, her head ached\nviolently, and the ground on which she stood seemed to reel, and the sky\nto turn round.  She sat down for a moment on the green grass.  What\nailed her? where was she? how could she get home?  Nan's little piteous\nwail, \"Me want my bekfas', me want my nursie, me want Hetty,\" almost\nirritated her.\n\n\"Oh, Nan,\" she said at last piteously, \"have you not got your own Annie?\nOh, Nan, dear little Nan, Annie feels so ill!\"\n\nNan had the biggest and softest of baby hearts--breakfast, nurse, Hetty,\nwere all forgotten in the crowning desire to comfort Annie.  She climbed\non her knee and stroked her face and kissed her lips.\n\n\"'Oo better now?\" she said in a tone of baby inquiry.\n\nAnnie roused herself with a great effort.\n\n\"Yes, darling,\" she said; \"we will try and get home.  Come, Tiger.\nTiger, dear, I don't want to go back to the gipsies; take me the other\nway--take me to Oakley.\"\n\nTiger again sniffed the air, looked anxiously at Annie, and trotted on\nin front.  Little Nan in her ragged gipsy clothes walked sedately by\nAnnie's side.\n\n\"Where 'oo s'oes?\" she said, pointing to the girl's bare feet.\n\n\"Gone, Nan--gone.  Never mind, I've got you.  My little treasure, my\nlittle love, you're safe at last.\"\n\nAs Annie tottered, rather than walked, down a narrow path which led\ndirectly through a field of standing corn, she was startled by the\nsudden apparition of a bright-eyed girl, who appeared so suddenly in her\npath that she might have been supposed to have risen out of the very\nground.\n\nThe girl stared hard at Annie, fixed her eyes inquiringly on Nan and\nTiger, and then, turning on her heel, dashed up the path, went through a\nturn-stile, across the road, and into a cottage.\n\n\"Mother,\" she exclaimed, \"I said she warn't a real gipsy: she's a-coming\nback, and her face is all streaked like, and she has a little 'un along\nwith her, and a dawg, and the only one as is gipsy is the dawg.  Come\nand look at her, mother; oh, she is a fine take-in!\"\n\nThe round-faced, good-humoured looking mother, whose name was Mrs\nWilliams, had been washing and putting away the breakfast things when\nher daughter entered.  She now wiped her hands hastily and came to the\ncottage door.\n\n\"Cross the road, and come to the stile, mother,\" said the energetic\nPeggy--\"oh, there she be a-creeping along--oh, ain't she a take-in?\"\n\n\"'Sakes alive!\" ejaculated Mrs Williams, \"the girl is ill! why, she\ncan't keep herself steady!  There!  I knew she'd fall; ah! poor little\nthing--poor little thing.\"\n\nIt did not take Mrs Williams an instant to reach Annie's side; and in\nanother moment she had lifted her in her strong arms and carried her\ninto the cottage, Peggy lifting Nan and following in the rear, while\nTiger walked by their sides.\n\nCHAPTER 48. DARK DAYS.\n\nA whole week had passed, and there were no tidings whatever of little\nNan or of Annie Forest.  No one at Lavender House had heard a word about\nthem; the police came and went, detectives even arrived from London, but\nthere were no traces whatever of the missing children.\n\nThe Midsummer holiday was now close at hand, but no one spoke of it or\nthought of it.  Mrs Willis told the teachers that the prizes should be\ndistributed, but she said she could invite no guests and could allow of\nno special festivities.  Miss Danesbury and Miss Good repeated her words\nto the school-girls, who answered without hesitation that they did not\nwish for feasting and merriment; they would rather the day passed\nunnoticed.  In truth, the fact that their baby was gone, that their\nfavourite and prettiest and brightest school-mate had also disappeared,\ncaused such gloom, such distress, such apprehension that even the most\nthoughtless of those girls could scarcely have laughed or been merry.\nSchool-hours were still kept after a fashion, but there was no life in\nthe lessons.  In truth, it seemed as if the sun would never shine again\nat Lavender House.\n\nHester was ill; not very ill--she had no fever, she had no cold; she\nhad, as the good doctor explained it, nothing at all wrong, except that\nher nervous system had got a shock.\n\n\"When the little one is found, Miss Hetty will be quite well again,\"\nsaid the good doctor: but the little one had not been found yet, and\nHester had completely broken down.  She lay on her bed, saying little or\nnothing, eating scarcely anything, sleeping not at all.  All the girls\nwere kind to her, and each one in the school took turns in trying to\ncomfort her; but no one could win a smile from Hester, and even Mrs\nWillis failed utterly to reach or touch her heart.\n\nMr Everard came once to see her, but he had scarcely spoken many words\nwhen Hester broke into an agony of weeping, and begged him to go away.\nHe shook his head when he left her, and said sadly to himself--\n\n\"That girl has got something on her mind; she is grieving for more than\nthe loss of her little sister.\"\n\nThe twentieth of June came at last, and the girls sat about in groups in\nthe pleasant, shady garden, and talked of the very sad breaking-up day\nthey were to have on the morrow, and wondered if, when they returned to\nschool again, Annie and little Nan would have been found.  Cecil Temple,\nDora Russell, and one or two others were sitting together, and\nwhispering in low voices.  Mary Price joined them, and said anxiously--\n\n\"I don't think the doctor is satisfied about Hester.  Perhaps I ought\nnot to have listened, but I heard him talking to Miss Danesbury just\nnow; he said she must be got to sleep somehow, and she is to have a\ncomposing draught to-night.\"\n\n\"I wish poor Hetty would not turn away from us all,\" said Cecil; \"I wish\nshe would not quite give up hope; I do feel sure that Nan and Annie will\nbe found yet.\"\n\n\"Have you been praying about it, Cecil?\" asked Mary, kneeling on the\ngrass, laying her elbows on Cecil's knees, and looking into her face.\n\"Do you say this because you have faith?\"\n\n\"I have prayed, and I have faith,\" replied Cecil in her simple, earnest\nway.  \"Why, Dora, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"Only that it's horrid to leave like this,\" said Dora; \"I--I thought my\nlast day at school would have been so different, and somehow I am sorry\nI spoke so much against that poor little Annie.\"\n\nHere Cecil suddenly rose from her seat, and, going up to Dora, clasped\nher arms round her neck.\n\n\"Thank you, Dora,\" she said with fervour; \"I love you for those words.\"\n\n\"Here comes Susy,\" remarked Mary Price.  \"I really don't think\n_anything_ would move Susy; she's just as stolid and indifferent as\never.  Ah, Susy, here's a place for you--oh, what _is_ the matter with\nPhyllis? see how she's rushing toward us!  Phyllis, my dear, don't break\nyour neck.\"\n\nSusan, with her usual nonchalance, seated herself by Dora Russell's\nside.  Phyllis burst excitedly into the group.\n\n\"I think,\" she exclaimed, \"I really, really do think that news has come\nof Annie's father.  Nora said that Janet told her that a foreign letter\ncame this morning to Mrs Willis, and somebody saw Mrs Willis talking\nto Miss Danesbury--oh, I forgot, only I know that the girls of the\nschool are whispering the news that Mrs Willis cried, and Miss\nDanesbury said, `After waiting for him four years, and now, when he\ncomes back, he won't find her!'  Oh, dear, oh, dear! there is Danesbury.\nCecil, darling love, go to her, and find out the truth.\"\n\nCecil rose at once, went across the lawn, said a few words to Miss\nDanesbury, and came back to the other girls.\n\n\"It is true,\" she said sadly; \"there came a letter this morning from\nCaptain Forest; he will be at Lavender House in a week.  Miss Danesbury\nsays it is a wonderful letter, and he has been shipwrecked, and on an\nisland by himself for ever so long; but he is safe now, and will soon be\nin England.  Miss Danesbury says Mrs Willis can scarcely speak about\nthat letter; she is in great, great trouble, and Miss Danesbury\nconfesses that they are all more anxious than they dare to admit about\nAnnie and little Nan.\"\n\nAt this moment the sound of carriage wheels was heard on the drive, and\nSusan, peering forward to see who was arriving, remarked in her usual\nnonchalant manner--\n\n\"Only the little Misses Bruce in their basket-carriage--what\ndull-looking women they are!\"\n\nNobody commented, however, on her observation, and gradually the little\ngroup of girls sank into absolute silence.\n\nFrom where they sat they could see the basket-carriage waiting at the\nfront entrance--the little ladies had gone inside, all was perfect\nsilence and stillness.\n\nSuddenly on the stillness a sound broke--the sound of a girl running\nquickly; nearer and nearer came the steps, and the four or five who sat\ntogether under the oak-tree noticed the quick panting breath, and felt\neven before a word was uttered that evil tidings were coming to them.\nThey all started to their feet, however; they all uttered a cry of\nhorror and distress when Hester herself broke into their midst.  She was\nsupposed to be lying down in a darkened room, she was supposed to be\nvery ill--what was she doing here?\n\n\"Hetty!\" exclaimed Cecil.\n\nHester pushed past her; she rushed up to Susan Drummond, and seized her\narm.\n\n\"News has come!\" she panted; \"news--news at last!  Nan is found!--and\nAnnie--they are both found--but Annie is dying.  Come, Susan, come this\nmoment; we must both tell what we know now.\"\n\nBy her impetuosity, by the intense fire of her passion and agony, even\nSusan was electrified into leaving her seat and going with her.\n\nCHAPTER 49. TWO CONFESSIONS.\n\nHester dragged her startled and rather unwilling companion in through\nthe front entrance, past some agitated-looking servants who stood about\nin the hall, and through the velvet curtains into Mrs Willis's boudoir.\n\nThe Misses Bruce were there, and Mrs Willis in her bonnet and cloak was\nhastily packing some things into a basket.\n\n\"I--I must speak to you,\" said Hester, going up to her governess.\n\"Susan and I have got something to say, and we must say it here, now at\nonce?\"\n\n\"No, not now, Hester,\" replied Mrs Willis, looking for a moment into\nher pupil's agitated face.  \"Whatever you and Susan Drummond have to\ntell cannot be listened to by me at this moment.  I have not an instant\nto lose.\"\n\n\"You are going to Annie?\" asked Hester.\n\n\"Yes; don't keep me.  Good-bye, my dears; good-bye.\"\n\nMrs Willis moved toward the door.  Hester, who felt almost beside\nherself, rushed after her, and caught her arm.\n\n\"Take us with you, take Susy and me with you--we must we must see Annie\nbefore she dies.\"\n\n\"Hush, my child,\" said Mrs Willis very quietly; \"try to calm yourself.\nWhatever you have got to say shall be listened to later on--now moments\nare precious, and I cannot attend to you.  Calm yourself, Hester, and\nthank God for your dear little sister's safety.  Prepare yourself to\nreceive her, for the carriage which takes me to Annie will bring little\nNan home.\"\n\nMrs Willis left the room, and Hester threw herself on hen knees and\ncovered her face with her trembling hands.  Presently she was aroused by\na light touch on her arm; it was Susan Drummond.\n\n\"I may go now, I suppose, Hester?  You are not quite determined to make\na fool of me, are you?\"\n\n\"I have determined to expose you, you coward, you mean, mean girl!\"\nanswered Hester, springing to her feet.  \"Come, I have no idea of\nletting you go.  Mrs Willis won't listen--we will find Mr Everard.\"\n\nWhether Susan would really have gone with Hester remains to be proved,\nbut just at that moment all possibility of retreat was cut away from her\nby Miss Agnes Bruce, who quietly entered Mrs Willis's private\nsitting-room, followed by the very man Hester was about to seek.\n\n\"I thought it best, my dear,\" she said, turning apologetically to\nHester, \"to go at once for our good clergyman; you can tell him all that\nis in your heart, and I will leave you.  Before I go, however.  I should\nlike to tell you how I found Annie and little Nan.\"\n\nHester made no answer; just for a brief moment she raised her eyes to\nMiss Agnes's kind face, then they sought the floor.\n\n\"The story can be told in a few words, dear,\" said the little lady.  \"A\nwork-woman of the name of Williams, whom my sister and I have employed\nfor years, and who lives near Oakley, called on us this morning to\napologise for not being able to finish some needlework.  She told us\nthat she had a sick child, and also a little girl of three, in her\nhouse.  She said she had found the child, in ragged gipsy garments,\nfainting in a field.  She took her into her house, and, on undressing\nher, found that she was no true gipsy, but that her face and hands and\narms had been dyed; she said the little one had been treated in a\nsimilar manner.  Jane's suspicions and mine were instantly roused, and\nwe went back with the woman to Oakley, and round, as we had anticipated,\nthat the children were little Nan and Annie.  The sad thing is that\nAnnie is in high fever, and knows no one.  We waited there until the\ndoctor arrived, who spoke very, very seriously of her case.  Little Nan\nis well, and asked for you.\"\n\nWith these last words Miss Agnes Bruce softly left the room, closing the\ndoor after her.\n\n\"Now, Susan,\" said Hester, without an instant's pause; \"come, let us\ntell Mr Everard of our wickedness.  Oh, sir,\" she added, raising her\neyes to the clergyman's face, \"if Annie dies I shall go mad.  Oh, I\ncannot, cannot bear life if Annie dies!\"\n\n\"Tell me what is wrong, my poor child,\" said Mr Everard.  He laid his\nhand on her shoulder, and gradually and skillfully drew from the\nagitated and miserable girl the story of her sin, of her cowardice, and\nof her deep, though until now unavailing repentance.  How from the first\nshe had hated and disliked Annie; how unjustly she had felt toward her;\nhow she had longed and hoped Annie was guilty; and how, when at last the\nclew was put into her hands to prove Annie's absolute innocence, she had\ndetermined not to use it.\n\n\"From the day Nan was lost,\" continued Hester, \"it has been all agony\nand all repentance; but, oh, I was too proud to tell!  I was too proud\nto humble myself to the very dust!\"\n\n\"But not now,\" said the clergyman very gently.\n\n\"No, no; not now.  I care for nothing now in all the world except that\nAnnie may live.\"\n\n\"You don't mind the fact that Mrs Willis and all your school-fellows\nmust know of this, and must--must judge you accordingly?\"\n\n\"They can't think worse of me than I think of myself.  I only want Annie\nto live.\"\n\n\"No, Hester,\" answered Mr Everard, \"you want more than that--you want\nfar more than that.  It may be that God will take Annie Forest away.  We\ncannot tell.  With Him alone are the issues of life or death.  What you\nreally want, my child, is the forgiveness of the little girl you have\nwronged, and the forgiveness of your Father in heaven.\"  Hester began to\nsob wildly.\n\n\"If--if she dies--may I see her first?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Yes; I will try and promise you that.  Now, will you go to your room?\nI must speak to Miss Drummond alone; she is a far worse culprit than\nyou.\"\n\nMr Everard opened the door for Hester, who went silently out.\n\n\"Meet me in the chapel to-night,\" he whispered low in her car, \"I will\ntalk with you and pray with you there.\"\n\nHe closed the door, and came back to Susan.\n\nAll throughout this interview his manner had been very gentle to Hester;\nbut the clergyman could be stern, and there was a gleam of very\nrighteous anger in his eyes as he turned to the sullen girl who leaned\nheavily against the table.\n\n\"This narrative of Hester Thornton's is, of course, quite true, Miss\nDrummond?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; there seems to be no use in denying that,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I must insist on your telling me the exact story of your sin.  There is\nno use in your attempting to deny anything; only the utmost candour on\nyour part can now save you from being publicly expelled.\"\n\n\"I am willing to tell,\" answered Susan.  \"I meant no harm; it was done\nas a bit of fun.  I had a cousin at home who was very clever at drawing\ncaricatures, and I happened to have nothing to do one day, and I was\nalone in Annie's bedroom, and I thought I'd like to see what she kept in\nher desk.  I always had a fancy for collecting odd keys, and I found one\non my bunch which fitted her desk exactly.  I opened it, and I found\nsuch a smart little caricature of Mrs Willis.  I sent the caricature to\nmy cousin, and begged of her to make an exact copy of it.  She did so,\nand I put Annie's back in her desk, and pasted the other into Cecil's\nbook.  I didn't like Dora Russell, and I wrapped up the sweeties in her\ntheme; but I did the other for pure fun, for I knew Cecil would be so\nshocked; but I never guessed the blame would fall on Annie.  When I\nfound it did, I felt inclined to tell once or twice, but it seemed too\nmuch trouble, and, besides, I knew Mrs Willis would punish me, and, of\ncourse, I didn't wish that.\n\n\"Dora Russell was always very nasty to me, and when I found she was\nputting on such airs, and pretending she could write such a grand essay\nfor the prize, I thought I'd take down her pride a bit.  I went to her\ndesk, and I got some of the rough copy of the thing she was calling `The\nRiver,' and I sent it off to my cousin, and my cousin made up such a\nridiculous paper, and she hit off Dora's writing to the life, and, of\ncourse, I had to put it into Dora's desk and tear up her real copy.  It\nwas very unlucky Hester being in the room.  Of course I never guessed\nthat, or I wouldn't have gone.  That was the night we all went with\nAnnie to the fairies' field.  I never meant to get Hester into a scrape,\nnor Annie either, for that matter; but, of course, I couldn't be\nexpected to tell on myself.\"\n\nSusan related her story in her usual monotonous and singsong voice.\nThere was no trace of apparent emotion on her face, or of regret in her\ntones.  When she had finished speaking Mr Everard was absolutely\nsilent.\n\n\"I took a great deal of trouble,\" continued Susan, after a pause, in a\nslightly fretful key.  \"It was really nothing but a joke, and I don't\nsee why such a fuss should have been made.  I know I lost a great deal\nof sleep trying to manage that twine business round my foot.  I don't\nthink I shall trouble myself playing any more tricks upon school-girls--\nthey are not worth it.\"\n\n\"You'll never play any more tricks on these girls,\" said Mr Everard,\nrising to his feet, and suddenly filling the room and reducing Susan to\nan abject silence by the ring of his stern, deep voice.  \"I take it upon\nme, in the absence of your mistress, to pronounce your punishment.  You\nleave Lavender House in disgrace this evening.  Miss Good will take you\nhome, and explain to your parents the cause of your dismissal.  You are\nnot to see _any_ of your school-fellows again.  Your meanness, your\ncowardice, your sin require no words on my part to deepen their\nvileness.  Through pure wantonness you have cast a cruel shadow on an\ninnocent young life.  If that girl dies, you indeed are not blameless in\nthe cause of her early removal, for through you her heart and spirit\nwere broken.  Miss Drummond, I pray God you may at least repent and be\nsorry.  There are some people mentioned in the Bible who are spoken of\nas past feeling.  Wretched girl, while there is yet time, pray that you\nmay not belong to them.  Now I must leave you, but I shall lock you in.\nMiss Good will come for you in about an hour to take you away.\"\n\nSusan Drummond sank down on the nearest seat, and began to cry softly;\none or two pin-pricks from Mr Everard's stern words may possibly have\nreached her shallow heart--no one can tell.  She left Lavender House\nthat evening, and none of the girls who had lived with her as their\nschool-mate heard of her again.\n\nCHAPTER 50. THE HEART OF LITTLE NAN.\n\nFor several days now Annie had lain unconscious in Mrs Williams's\nlittle bedroom; the kind-hearted woman could not find it in her heart to\nsend the sick child away.  Her husband and the neighbours expostulated\nwith her, and said that Annie was only a poor little waif.\n\n\"She has no call on you,\" said Jane Allen, a hard-featured woman who\nlived next door.  \"Why should you put yourself out just for a sick lass?\nand she'll be much better on in the workhouse infirmary.\"\n\nBut Mrs Williams shook her head at her hard-featured and hard-hearted\nneighbour, and resisted her husband's entreaties.\n\n\"Eh!\" she said, \"but the poor lamb needs a good bit of mothering, and I\nmisdoubt me she wouldn't get much of that in the infirmary.\"\n\nSo Annie stayed, and tossed from side to side of her little bed, and\nmurmured unintelligible words, and grew daily a little weaker and a\nlittle more delirious.  The parish doctor called, and shook his head\nover her: he was not a particularly clever man, but he was the best the\nWilliamses could afford.  While Annie suffered and went deeper into that\nvalley of humiliation and weakness which leads to the gate of the Valley\nof the Shadow of Death, little Nan played with Peggy Williams, and\naccustomed herself after the fashion of little children to all the ways\nof her new and humble home.\n\nIt was on the eighth day of Annie's fever that the Misses Bruce\ndiscovered her, and on the evening of that day Mrs Willis knelt by her\nlittle favourite's bed.  A better doctor had been called in, and all\nthat money could procure had been got now for poor Annie; but the second\ndoctor considered her case even more critical, and said that the close\nair of the cottage was much against her recovery.\n\n\"I didn't make that caricature; I took the girls into the fairies'\nfield, but I never pasted that caricature into Cecil's book.  I know you\ndon't believe me, Cecil; but do you think I would really do anything so\nmean about one whom I love?  No, no!  I am innocent!  God knows it.\nYes, I am glad of that--God knows it.\"\n\nOver, and over in Mrs Willis's presence these piteous words would come\nfrom the fever-stricken child, but always when she came to the little\nsentence \"God knows I am innocent,\" her voice would grow tranquil, and a\nfaint and sweet smile would play round her lips.\n\nLate that night a carriage drew up at a little distance from the\ncottage, and a moment or two afterwards Mrs Willis was called out of\nthe room to speak to Cecil Temple.\n\n\"I have found out the truth about Annie; I have come at once to tell\nyou,\" she said; and then she repeated the substance of Hester's and\nSusan's story.\n\n\"God help me for having misjudged her,\" murmured the head-mistress; then\nshe bade Cecil \"good-night,\" and returned to the sick-room.\n\nThe next time Annie broke out with her piteous wail, \"They believe me\nguilty--Mrs Willis does--they all do,\" the mistress laid her hand with\na firm and gentle pressure on the child's arm.\n\n\"Not now, my dear,\" she said, in a slow, clear, and emphatic voice.\n\"God has shown your governess the truth, and she believes in you.\"\n\nThe very carefully-uttered words pierced through the clouded brain; for\na moment Annie lay quite still, with her bright and lovely eyes fixed on\nher teacher.\n\n\"Is that really you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am here, my darling.\"\n\n\"And you believe in me?\"\n\n\"I do most absolutely.\"\n\n\"God does, too, you know,\" answered Annie--bringing out the words\nquickly, and turning her head to the other side.  The fever had once\nmore gained supremacy, and she rambled on unceasingly through the dreary\nnight.\n\nNow, however, when the passionate words broke out, \"They believe me\nguilty,\" Mrs Willis always managed to quiet her by saying, \"I know you\nare innocent.\"\n\nThe next day at noon those girls who had not gone home--for many had\nstarted by the morning train--were wandering aimlessly about the\ngrounds.  Mr Everard had gone to see Annie, and had promised to bring\nback the latest tidings about her.\n\nHester, holding little Nan's hand--for she could scarcely bear to have\nher recovered treasure out of sight--had wandered away from the rest of\nher companions, and had seated herself with Nan under a large oak-tree\nwhich grew close to the entrance of the avenue.  She had come here in\norder to be the very first to see Mr Everard on his return.  Nan had\nclimbed into Hester's lap, and Hester had buried her aching head in\nlittle Nan's bright curls, when she started suddenly to her feet and ran\nforward.  Her quick ears had detected the sound of wheels.\n\nHow soon Mr Everard had returned; surely the news was bad!  She flew to\nthe gate, and held it open in order to avoid the short delay which the\nlodge-keeper might cause in coming to unfasten it.  She flushed however,\nvividly, and felt half inclined to retreat into the shade, when she saw\nthat the gentleman who was approaching was not Mr Everard, but a tall,\nhandsome, and foreign-looking man, who drove a light dog-cart himself.\nThe moment he saw Hester with little Nan clinging to her skirts he\nstopped short.\n\n\"Is this Lavender House, little girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Hester.\n\n\"And can you tell me--but of course you know--you are one of the young\nladies who live here, eh?\"\n\nHester nodded.\n\n\"Then you can tell me if Mrs Willis is at home--but of course she is.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered Hester; \"I am sorry to tell you that Mrs Willis is\naway.  She has been called away on very, very sad business; she won't\ncome back to-night.\"\n\nSomething in Hester's tone caused the stranger to look at her\nattentively; he jumped off the dog-cart and came to her side.\n\n\"See, here, Miss--\"\n\n\"Thornton,\" put in Hester.\n\n\"Yes, Miss--Miss Thornton, perhaps you can manage for me as well as Mrs\nWillis; after all I don't particularly want to see her.  If you belong\nto Lavender House, you, of course, know my--I mean you have a\nschool-mate here, a little, pretty gipsy rogue called Forest--little\nAnnie Forest.  I want to see her--can you take me to her!\"\n\n\"You are her father?\" gasped Hester.\n\n\"Yes, my dear child, I am her father.  Now you can take me to her at\nonce.\"\n\nHester covered her face.\n\n\"Oh, I cannot,\" she said--\"I cannot take you to Annie.  Oh, sir, if you\nknew all, you would feel inclined to kill me.  Don't ask me about\nAnnie--don't, don't.\"\n\nThe stranger looked fairly nonplussed and not a little alarmed.  Just at\nthis moment Nan's tiny fingers touched his hand.\n\n\"Me'll lake 'oo to my Annie,\" she said--\"mine poor Annie.  Annie's vedy\nsick, but me'll take 'oo.\"\n\nThe tall, foreign-looking man lifted Nan into his arms.\n\n\"Sick, is she?\" he answered.  \"Look here young lady,\" he added, turning\nto Hester, \"whatever you have got to say, I am sure you will try and say\nit; you will pity a father's anxiety and master your own feelings.\nWhere _is_ my little girl?\"\n\nHester hastily dried her tears.\n\n\"She is in a cottage near Oakley, sir.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  Oakley is some miles from here?\"\n\n\"And she is very ill.\"\n\n\"What of?\"\n\n\"Fever; they--they fear she may die.\"\n\n\"Take me to her,\" said the stranger.  \"If she is ill and dying she wants\nme.  Take me to her at once.  Here, jump on the dog-cart; and, little\none, you shall come too.\"\n\nSo furiously did Captain Forest drive that in a very little over an\nhour's time his panting horse stopped at a few steps from the cottage.\nHe called to a boy to hold him, and, accompanied by Hester, and carrying\nNan in his arms, he stood on the threshold of Mrs Williams' humble\nlittle abode.  Mr Everard was coming out.\n\n\"Hester,\" he said, \"you here?  I was coming for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, then she is worse?\"\n\n\"She is conscious, and has asked for you.  Yes, she is very, very ill.\"\n\n\"Mr Everard, this gentleman is Annie's father.\"\n\nMr Everard looked pityingly at Captain Forest.\n\n\"You have come back at a sad hour, sir,\" he said.  \"But no, it cannot\nharm her to see you.  Come with me.\"\n\nCaptain Forest went first into the sick-room; Hester waited outside.\nShe had the little kitchen to herself, for all the Williamses, with the\nexception of the good mother, had moved for the time being to other\nquarters.  Surely Mr Everard would come for her in a moment?  Surely\nCaptain Forest, who had gone into the sick-room with Nan in his arms,\nwould quickly return?  There was no sound.  All was absolute quiet.  How\nsoon would Hester be summoned?  Could she--could she bear to look at\nAnnie's dying face?  Her agony drove her down on her knees.\n\n\"Oh, if you would only spare Annie!\" she prayed to God.  Then she wiped\nher eyes.  This terrible suspense seemed more than she could bear.\nSuddenly the bedroom door was softly and silently opened, and Mr\nEverard came out.\n\n\"She sleeps,\" he said; \"there is a shadow of hope.  Little Nan has done\nit.  Nan asked to lie down beside her and she said, `Poor Annie! poor\nAnnie!' and stroked her cheek; and in some way, I don't know how, the\ntwo have gone to sleep together.  Annie did not even glance at her\nfather; she was quite taken up with Nan.  You can come to the door and\nlook at her, Hester.\"\n\nHester did so.  A time had been when she could scarcely have borne that\nsight without a pang of jealousy; now she turned to Mr Everard:\n\n\"I--I could even give her the heart of little Nan to keep her here,\" she\nmurmured.\n\nCHAPTER 51. THE PRIZE ESSAY.\n\nAnnie did not die.  The fever passed away in that long and refreshing\nsleep, while Nan's cool hand lay against her cheek.  She came slowly,\nslowly back to life--to a fresh, a new, and a glad life.  Hester, from\nbeing her enemy, was now her dearest and warmest friend.  Her father was\nat home again, and she could no longer think or speak of herself as\nlonely or sad.  She recovered, and in future days reigned as a greater\nfavourite than ever at Lavender House.  It is only fair to say that\nTiger never went back to the gipsies, but devoted himself first and\nforemost to Annie, and then to the Captain, who pronounced him a capital\ndog, and when he heard his story vowed he never would part with him.\n\nOwing to Annie's illness, and to all the trouble and confusion which\nimmediately ensued, Mrs Willis did not give away her prizes at the\nusual time; but when her scholars once more assembled at Lavender House\nshe astonished several of them by a few words.\n\n\"My dears,\" she said, standing in her accustomed place at the head of\nthe long school-room, \"I intend now, before our first day of lessons\nbegins, to distribute those prizes which would have been yours, under\nordinary circumstances, on the twenty-first of June.  The prizes will be\ndistributed during the afternoon recess: but here, and now, I wish to\nsay something about--and also to give away--the prize for English\ncomposition.  Six essays, all written with more or less care, have been\ngiven to me to inspect.  There are reasons which we need not now go into\nwhich made it impossible to me to say anything in favour of a theme\ncalled `The River,' written by my late pupil, Miss Russell: but I can\ncordially praise a very nice historical sketch of Marie Antoinette, the\nwork of Hester Thornton.  Mary Price has also written a study which\npleases me much, as it shows thought and even a little originality.  The\nremainder of the six essays simply reach an ordinary average.  You will\nbe surprised therefore, my dears, to learn that I do not award the prize\nto any of these themes, but rather to a seventh composition, which was\nput into my hands yesterday by Miss Danesbury.  It is crude and\nunfinished, and doubtless but for her recent illness would have received\nmany corrections: but these few pages, which are called `A Lonely\nChild,' drew tears from my eyes; crude as they are, they have the merit\nof real originality.  They are too morbid to read to you, girls, and I\nsincerely trust and pray the young writer may never pen anything so sad\nagain.  Such as they are, however, they rank first in the order of\nmerit, and the prize is hers.  Annie, my dear, come forward.\"\n\nAnnie left her seat, and, amid the cheers of her companions, went up to\nMrs Willis, who placed a locket, attached to a slender gold chain,\nround her neck; the locket contained a miniature of the head-mistress's\nmuch-loved face.\n\n\"After all, think of our Annie Forest turning out clever, as well as\nbeing the prettiest and dearest girl in the school I exclaimed several\nor her companions.\"\n\n\"Only I do wish,\" added one, \"that Mrs Willis had let us see the essay.\nAnnie, treasure, come here; tell us what the `Lonely Child' was about.\"\n\n\"I don't remember,\" answered Annie.  \"I don't know what loneliness means\nnow, so how can I describe it?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe End.\n",
