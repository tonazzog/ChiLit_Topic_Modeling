  "content": "Vice Versa\nF. Anstey\n\n\nThere is an old story of a punctiliously polite Greek, who, while\nperforming the funeral of an infant daughter, felt bound to make his\nexcuses to the spectators for \"bringing out such a ridiculously small\ncorpse to so large a crowd.\"\n\nThe Author, although he trusts that the present production has more\nvitality than the Greek gentleman's child, still feels that in these\ndays of philosophical fiction, metaphysical romance, and novels with a\npurpose, some apology may perhaps be needed for a tale which has the\nunambitious and frivolous aim of mere amusement.\n\nHowever, he ventures to leave the tale to be its own apology, merely\ncontenting himself with the entreaty that his little fish may be spared\nthe rebuke that it is not a whale.\n\nIn submitting it with all possible respect to the Public, he conceives\nthat no form of words he could devise would appeal so simply and\npowerfully to their feelings as that which he has ventured to adopt from\na certain Anglo-Portuguese Phrase-Book of deserved popularity.\n\nLike the compilers of that work, he--\"expects then who the little book,\nfor the care what he wrote him and her typographical corrections, will\ncommend itself to the--_British Paterfamilias_--at which he dedicates\nhim particularly.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. _Black Monday_\n\n     \"In England, where boys go to boarding schools, if the holidays\n     were not long there would be no opportunity for cultivating the\n     domestic affections.\"--_Letter of Lord Campbell's, 1835_.\n\n\nOn a certain Monday evening late in January, 1881, Paul Bultitude, Esq.\n(of Mincing Lane, Colonial Produce Merchant), was sitting alone in his\ndining-room at Westbourne Terrace after dinner.\n\nThe room was a long and lofty one, furnished in the stern uncompromising\nstyle of the Mahogany Age, now supplanted by the later fashions of\ndecoration which, in their outset original and artistic, seem fairly on\nthe way to become as meaningless and conventional.\n\nHere were no skilfully contrasted shades of grey or green, no dado, no\ndistemper on the walls; the woodwork was grained and varnished after the\nmanner of the Philistines, the walls papered in dark crimson, with heavy\ncurtains of the same colour, and the sideboard, dinner-waggon, and row\nof stiff chairs were all carved in the same massive and expensive style\nof ugliness. The pictures were those familiar presentments of dirty\nrabbits, fat white horses, bloated goddesses, and misshapen boors, by\nmasters who, if younger than they assume to be, must have been quite old\nenough to know better.\n\nMr. Bultitude was a tall and portly person, of a somewhat pompous and\noverbearing demeanour; not much over fifty, but looking considerably\nolder. He had a high shining head, from which the hair had mostly\ndeparted, what little still remained being of a grizzled auburn,\nprominent pale blue eyes with heavy eyelids and fierce, bushy\nwhitey-brown eyebrows. His general expression suggested a conviction of\nhis own extreme importance, but, in spite of this, his big underlip\ndrooped rather weakly and his double chin slightly receded, giving a\njudge of character reason for suspecting that a certain obstinate\npositiveness observable in Mr. Bultitude's manner might possibly be due\nless to the possession of an unusually strong will than to the\ncircumstance that, by some fortunate chance, that will had hitherto\nnever met with serious opposition.\n\nThe room, with all its Ã¦sthetic shortcomings, was comfortable enough,\nand Mr. Bultitude's attitude--he was lying back in a well-wadded leather\narm-chair, with a glass of claret at his elbow and his feet stretched\nout towards the ruddy blaze of the fire--seemed at first sight to imply\nthat happy after-dinner condition of perfect satisfaction with oneself\nand things in general, which is the natural outcome of a good cook, a\ngood conscience, and a good digestion.\n\nAt first sight; because his face did not confirm the impression--there\nwas a latent uneasiness in it, an air of suppressed irritation, as if he\nexpected and even dreaded to be disturbed at any moment, and yet was\npowerless to resent the intrusion as he would like to do.\n\nAt the slightest sound in the hall outside he would half rise in his\nchair and glance at the door with a mixture of alarm and resignation,\nand as often as the steps died away and the door remained closed, he\nwould sink back and resettle himself with a shrug of evident relief.\n\nHabitual novel readers on reading thus far will, I am afraid, prepare\nthemselves for the arrival of a faithful cashier with news of\nirretrievable ruin, or a mysterious and cynical stranger threatening\ndisclosures of a disgraceful nature.\n\nBut all such anticipations must at once be ruthlessly dispelled. Mr.\nBultitude, although he was certainly a merchant, was a fairly successful\none--in direct defiance of the laws of fiction, where any connection\nwith commerce seems to lead naturally to failure in one of the three\nvolumes.\n\nHe was an elderly gentleman, too, of irreproachable character and\nantecedents; no Damocles' sword of exposure was swinging over his bald\nbut blameless head; he had no disasters to fear and no indiscretions to\nconceal. He had not been intended for melodrama, with which, indeed, he\nwould not have considered it a respectable thing to be connected.\n\nIn fact, the secret of his uneasiness was so absurdly simple and\ncommonplace that I am rather ashamed to have made even a temporary\nmystery of it.\n\nHis son Dick was about to return to school that evening, and Mr.\nBultitude was expecting every moment to be called upon to go through a\nparting scene with him; that was really all that was troubling him.\n\nThis sounds very creditable to the tenderness of his feelings as a\nfather--for there are some parents who bear such a bereavement at the\nclose of the holidays with extraordinary fortitude, if they do not\nactually betray an unnatural satisfaction at the event.\n\nBut it was not exactly from softness of heart that he was restless and\nimpatient, nor did he dread any severe strain upon his emotions. He was\nnot much given to sentiment, and was the author of more than one of\nthose pathetically indignant letters to the papers, in which the British\nparent denounces the expenses of education and the unconscionable length\nand frequency of vacations.\n\nHe was one of those nervous and fidgety persons who cannot understand\ntheir own children, looking on them as objectionable monsters whose next\nmovements are uncertain--much as Frankenstein must have felt towards\n_his_ monster.\n\nHe hated to have a boy about the house, and positively writhed under the\nirrelevant and irrepressible questions, the unnecessary noises and\nboisterous high spirits which nothing would subdue; his son's society\nwas to him simply an abominable nuisance, and he pined for a release\nfrom it from the day the holidays began.\n\nHe had been a widower for nearly three years, and no doubt the loss of a\nmother's loving tact, which can check the heedless merriment before it\nbecomes intolerable, and interpret and soften the most peevish and\nunreasonable of rebukes, had done much to make the relations between\nparent and children more strained than they might otherwise have been.\n\nAs it was, Dick's fear of his father was just great enough to prevent\nany cordiality between them, and not sufficient to make him careful to\navoid offence, and it is not surprising if, when the time came for him\nto return to his house of bondage at Dr. Grimstone's, Crichton House,\nMarket Rodwell, he left his father anything but inconsolable.\n\nJust now, although Mr. Bultitude was so near the hour of his\ndeliverance, he still had a bad quarter of an hour before him, in which\nthe last farewells must be said, and he found it impossible under these\ncircumstances to compose himself for a quiet half-hour's nap, or retire\nto the billiard-room for a cup of coffee and a mild cigar, as he would\notherwise have done--since he was certain to be disturbed.\n\nAnd there was another thing which harassed him, and that was a haunting\ndread lest at the last moment some unforeseen accident should prevent\nthe boy's departure after all. He had some grounds for this, for only a\nweek before, a sudden and unprecedented snowstorm had dashed his hopes,\non the eve of their fulfilment, by forcing the Doctor to postpone the\nday on which his school was to re-assemble, and now Mr. Bultitude sat on\nbrambles until he had seen the house definitely rid of his son's\npresence.\n\nAll this time, while the father was fretting and fuming in his\narm-chair, the son, the unlucky cause of all this discomfort, had been\nstanding on the mat outside the door, trying to screw up enough courage\nto go in as if nothing was the matter with him.\n\nHe was not looking particularly boisterous just then. On the contrary,\nhis face was pale, and his eyelids rather redder than he would quite\ncare for them to be seen by any of the \"fellows\" at Crichton House. All\nthe life and spirit had gone out of him for the time; he had a\ntroublesome dryness in his throat, and a general sensation of chill\nheaviness, which he himself would have described--expressively enough,\nif not with academical elegance--as \"feeling beastly.\"\n\nThe stoutest hearted boy, returning to the most perfect of schools,\ncannot always escape something of this at that dark hour when the sands\nof the holidays have run out to their last golden grain, when the boxes\nare standing corded and labelled in the hall, and some one is going to\nfetch the fatal cab.\n\nDick had just gone the round of the house, bidding dreary farewells to\nall the servants; an unpleasant ordeal which he would gladly have\ndispensed with, if possible, and which did not serve to raise his\nspirits.\n\nUpstairs, in the bright nursery, he had found his old nurse sitting\nsewing by the high wire fender. She was a stern, hard-featured old lady,\nwho had systematically slapped him through infancy into boyhood, and he\nhad had some stormy passages with her during the past few weeks; but she\nsoftened now in the most unexpected manner as she said good-bye, and\ntold him he was a \"pleasant, good-hearted young gentleman, after all,\nthough that aggravating and contrairy sometimes.\" And then she\npredicted, with some of the rashness attaching to irresponsibility, that\nhe would be \"the best boy this next term as ever was, and work hard at\nall his lessons, and bring home a prize\"--but all this unusual\ngentleness only made the interview more difficult to come out of with\nany credit for self-control.\n\nThen downstairs, the cook had come up in her evening brown print and\nclean collar, from her warm spice-scented kitchen, to remark cheerily\nthat \"Lor bless his heart, what with all these telegrafts and things,\ntime flew so fast nowadays that they'd be having him back again before\nthey all knew where they were!\" which had a certain spurious consolation\nabout it, until one saw that, after all, it put the case entirely from\nher own standpoint.\n\nAfter this Dick had parted from his elder sister Barbara and his young\nbrother Roly, and had arrived where we found him first, at the mat\noutside the dining-room door, where he still lingered shivering in the\ncold foggy hall.\n\nSomehow, he could not bring himself to take the next step at once; he\nknew pretty well what his father's feelings would be, and a parting is a\nvery unpleasant ceremony to one who feels that the regret is all on his\nown side.\n\nBut it was no use putting it off any longer; he resolved at last to go\nin and get it over, and opened the door accordingly. How warm and\ncomfortable the room looked--more comfortable than it had ever seemed to\nhim before, even on the first day of the holidays!\n\nAnd his father would be sitting there in a quarter of an hour's time,\njust as he was now, while he himself would be lumbering along to the\nstation through the dismal raw fog!\n\nHow unspeakably delightful it must be, thought Dick enviously, to be\ngrown up and never worried by the thoughts of school and lesson-books;\nto be able to look forward to returning to the same comfortable house,\nand living the same easy life, day after day, week after week, with no\nfear of a swiftly advancing Black Monday.\n\nGloomy moralists might have informed him that we cannot escape school by\nsimply growing up, and that, even for those who contrive this and make\na long holiday of their lives, there comes a time when the days are\ngrudgingly counted to a blacker Monday than ever made a school-boy's\nheart quake within him.\n\nBut then Dick would never have believed them, and the moralists would\nonly have wasted much excellent common sense upon him.\n\nPaul Bultitude's face cleared as he saw his son come in. \"There you are,\neh?\" he said, with evident satisfaction, as he turned in his chair,\nintending to cut the scene as short as possible. \"So you're off at last?\nWell, holidays can't last for ever--by a merciful decree of Providence,\nthey don't last quite for ever! There, good-bye, good-bye, be a good boy\nthis term, no more scrapes, mind. And now you'd better run away, and put\non your coat--you're keeping the cab waiting all this time.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" said Dick, \"Boaler hasn't gone to fetch one yet.\"\n\n\"Not gone to fetch a cab yet!\" cried Paul, with evident alarm, \"why, God\nbless my soul, what's the man thinking about? You'll lose your train! I\nknow you'll lose the train, and there will be another day lost, after\nthe extra week gone already through that snow! I must see to this\nmyself. Ring the bell, tell Boaler to start this instant--I insist on\nhis fetching a cab this instant!\"\n\n\"Well, it's not my fault, you know,\" grumbled Dick, not considering so\nmuch anxiety at all flattering, \"but Boaler has gone now. I just heard\nthe gate shut.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said his father, with more composure, \"and now,\" he suggested,\n\"you'd better shake hands, and then go up and say good-bye to your\nsister--you've no time to spare.\"\n\n\"I've said good-bye to them,\" said Dick. \"Mayn't I stay here till--till\nBoaler comes?\"\n\nThis request was due, less to filial affection than a faint desire for\ndessert, which even his feelings could not altogether stifle. Mr.\nBultitude granted it with a very bad grace.\n\n\"I suppose you can if you want to,\" he said impatiently, \"only do one\nthing or the other--stay outside, or shut the door and come in and sit\ndown quietly. I cannot sit in a thorough draught!\"\n\nDick obeyed, and applied himself to the dessert with rather an injured\nexpression.\n\nHis father felt a greater sense of constraint and worry than ever; the\ninterview, as he had feared, seemed likely to last some time, and he\nfelt that he ought to improve the occasion in some way, or, at all\nevents, make some observation. But, for all that, he had not the\nremotest idea what to say to this red-haired, solemn boy, who sat\nstaring gloomily at him in the intervals of filling his mouth. The\nsituation grew more embarrassing every moment.\n\nAt last, as he felt himself likely to have more to say in reproof than\non any other subject, he began with that.\n\n\"There's one thing I want to talk to you about before you go,\" he began,\n\"and that's this. I had a most unsatisfactory report of you this last\nterm; don't let me have that again. Dr. Grimstone tells me--ah, I have\nhis letter here--yes, he says (and just attend, instead of making\nyourself ill with preserved ginger)--he says, 'Your son has great\nnatural capacity, and excellent abilities; but I regret to say that,\ninstead of applying himself as he might do, he misuses his advantages,\nand succeeds in setting a mischievous example to--if not actually\nmisleading--his companions.' That's a pleasant account for a father to\nread! Here am I, sending you to an expensive school, furnishing you with\ngreat natural capacity and excellent abilities, and--and--every other\nschool requisite, and all you do is to misuse them! It's disgraceful!\nAnd misleading your companions, too! Why, at your age, they ought to\nmislead _you_--No, I don't mean that--but what I may tell you is that\nI've written a very strong letter to Dr. Grimstone, saying what pain it\ngave me to hear you misbehaved yourself, and telling him, if he ever\ncaught you setting an example of any sort, mind that, _any_ sort, in the\nfuture--he was to, ah, to remember some of Solomon's very sensible\nremarks on the subject. So I should strongly advise you to take care\nwhat you're about in future, for your own sake!\"\n\nThis was not a very encouraging address, perhaps, but it did not seem to\ndistress Dick to any extent; he had heard very much the same sort of\nthing several times before, and had been fully prepared for it then.\n\nHe had been seeking distraction in almonds and raisins, but now they\nonly choked instead of consoling him, and he gave them up and sat\nbrooding silently over his hard lot instead, with a dull, blank\ndejection which those only who have gone through the same thing in their\nboyhood will understand. To others, whose school life has been one\nunchequered course of excitement and success, it will be\nincomprehensible enough--and so much the better for them.\n\nHe sat listening to the grim sphinx clock on the black marble\nchimneypiece, as it remorselessly ticked away his last few moments of\nhome-life, and he ingeniously set himself to crown his sorrow by\nreviving recollections of happier days.\n\nIn one of the corners of the overmantel there was still a sprig of\nwithered laurel left forgotten, and his eye fell on it now with grim\nsatisfaction. He made his thoughts travel back to that delightful\nafternoon on Christmas Eve, when they had all come home riotous through\nthe brilliant streets, laden with purchases from the Baker Street\nBazaar, and then had decorated the rooms with such free and careless\ngaiety.\n\nAnd the Christmas dinner too! He had sat just where he was sitting now,\nwith, ah, such a difference in every other respect--the time had not\ncome then when the thought of \"only so many more weeks and days left\"\nhad begun to intrude its grisly shape, like the skull at an ancient\nfeast.\n\nAnd yet he could distinctly recollect now, and with bitter remorse, that\nhe had not enjoyed himself then as much as he ought to have done; he\neven remembered an impious opinion of his that the proceedings were\n\"slow.\" Slow! with plenty to eat, and three (four, if he had only known\nit) more weeks of holiday before him; with Boxing Day and the brisk\nexhilarating drive to the Crystal Palace immediately following, with all\nthe rest of a season of licence and varied joys to come, which he could\nhardly trust himself to look back upon now! He must have been mad to\nthink such a thing.\n\nOverhead his sister Barbara was playing softly one of the airs from \"The\nPirates\" (it was Frederic's appeal to the Major-General's daughters),\nand the music, freed from the serio-comic situation which it\nillustrates, had a tenderness and pathos of its own which went to Dick's\nheart and intensified his melancholy.\n\nHe had gone (in secret, for Mr. Bultitude disapproved of such\ndissipations) to hear the Opera in the holidays, and now the piano\nconjured the whole scene up for him again--there would be no more\ntheatre-going for him for a very long time!\n\nBy this time Mr. Bultitude began to feel the silence becoming once more\noppressive, and roused himself with a yawn. \"Heigho!\" he said, \"Boaler's\nan uncommonly long time fetching that cab!\"\n\nDick felt more injured than ever, and showed it by drawing what he\nintended for a moving sigh.\n\nUnfortunately it was misunderstood.\n\n\"I do wish, sir,\" said his parent testily, \"you would try to break\nyourself of that habit of breathing hard. The society of a grampus (for\nit's no less) delights no one and offends many--including me--and for\nHeaven's sake, Dick, don't kick the leg of the table in that way; you\nknow it simply maddens me. What do you do it for? Why can't you learn to\nsit at table like a gentleman?\"\n\nDick mumbled some apology, and then, having found his tongue and\nremembered his necessities, said, with a nervous catch in his voice,\n\"Oh, I say, father, will you--can you let me have some pocket-money,\nplease, to go back with?\"\n\nMr. Bultitude looked as if his son had petitioned for a latch-key.\n\n\"Pocket-money!\" he repeated, \"why, you can't want money. Didn't your\ngrandmother give you a sovereign as a Christmas-box? And I gave you ten\nshillings myself!\"\n\n\"I do want it, though,\" said Dick; \"that's all spent. And you know you\nalways _have_ given me money to take back.\"\n\n\"If I do give you some, you'll only go and spend it,\" grumbled Mr.\nBultitude, as if he considered money an object of art.\n\n\"I shan't spend it all at once, and I shall want some to put in the\nplate on Sundays. We always have to put in the plate when it's a\ncollection. And there's the cab to pay.\"\n\n\"Boaler has orders to pay your cab--as you know well enough,\" said his\nfather, \"but I suppose you must have some, though you cost me enough,\nHeaven knows, without this additional expense.\"\n\nAnd at this he brought up a fistful of loose silver and gold from one of\nhis trouser-pockets, and spread it deliberately out on the table in\nfront of him in shining rows.\n\nDick's eyes sparkled at the sight of so much wealth; for a moment or two\nhe almost forgot the pangs of approaching exile in the thought of the\ndignity and credit which a single one of those bright new sovereigns\nwould procure for him.\n\nIt would ensure him surreptitious luxuries and open friendships as long\nas it lasted. Even Tipping, the head boy of the school, who had gone\ninto tails, brought back no more, and besides, the money would bring\nhim handsomely out of certain pecuniary difficulties to which an\nunexpected act of parental authority had exposed him; he could easily\ndispose of all claims with such a sum at command, and then his father\ncould so easily spare it out of so much!\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Bultitude, with great care and precision, selected from\nthe coins before him a florin, two shillings, and two sixpences, which\nhe pushed across to his son, who looked at them with a disappointment he\ndid not care to conceal.\n\n\"An uncommonly liberal allowance for a young fellow like you,\" he\nobserved. \"Don't buy any foolishness with it, and if, towards the end of\nthe term you want a little more, and write an intelligible letter asking\nfor it, and I think proper to let you have it--why, you'll get it, you\nknow.\"\n\nDick had not the courage to ask for more, much as he longed to do so, so\nhe put the money in his purse with very qualified expressions of\ngratitude.\n\nIn his purse he seemed to find something which had escaped his memory,\nfor he took out a small parcel and unfolded it with some hesitation.\n\n\"I nearly forgot,\" he said, speaking with more animation than he had yet\ndone, \"I didn't like to take it without asking you, but is this any use?\nMay I have it?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Mr. Bultitude, sharply, \"what's that? Something else--what is\nit you want now?\"\n\n\"It's only that stone Uncle Duke brought mamma from India; the thing, he\nsaid, they called a 'Pagoda stone,' or something, out there.\"\n\n\"Pagoda stone? The boy means GarudÃ¢ Stone. I should like to know how you\ngot hold of that; you've been meddling in my drawers, now, a thing I\nwill not put up with, as I've told you over and over again.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't, then,\" said Dick, \"I found it in a tray in the\ndrawing-room, and Barbara said, perhaps, if I asked you, you might let\nme have it, as she didn't think it was any use to you.\"\n\n\"Then Barbara had no right to say anything of the sort.\"\n\n\"But may I have it? I may, mayn't I?\" persisted Dick.\n\n\"Have it? certainly not. What could you possibly want with a thing like\nthat? It's ridiculous. Give it to me.\"\n\nDick handed it over reluctantly enough. It was not much to look at,\nquite an insignificant-looking little square tablet of greyish green\nstone, pierced at one angle, and having on two of its faces faint traces\nof mysterious letters or symbols, which time had made very difficult to\ndistinguish.\n\nIt looked harmless enough as Mr. Bultitude took it in his hand; there\nwas no kindly hand to hold him back, no warning voice to hint that there\nmight possibly be sleeping within that small marble block the pent-up\nenergy of long-forgotten Eastern necromancy, just as ready as ever to\nawake into action at the first words which had power to evoke it.\n\nThere was no one; but even if there had been such a person, Paul\nBultitude was a sober prosaic individual, who would probably have\ntreated the warning as a piece of ridiculous superstition.\n\nAs it was, no man could have put himself in a position of extreme peril\nwith a more perfect unconsciousness of his danger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. _A Grand Transformation Scene_\n\n     \"Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis.\"\n\n\nPaul Bultitude put on his glasses to examine the stone more carefully,\nfor it was some time since he had last seen or thought about it. Then he\nlooked up and said once more, \"What use would a thing like this be to\nyou?\"\n\nDick would have considered it a very valuable prize indeed; he could\nhave exhibited it to admiring friends--during lessons, of course, when\nit would prove a most agreeable distraction; he could have played with\nand fingered it incessantly, invented astonishing legends of its powers\nand virtues; and, at last, when he had grown tired of it, have bartered\nit for any more desirable article that might take his fancy. All these\nadvantages were present to his mind in a vague shifting form, but he\ncould not find either courage or words to explain them.\n\nConsequently he only said awkwardly, \"Oh, I don't know, I should like\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, any way,\" said Paul, \"you certainly won't have it. It's worth\nkeeping, whatever it is, as the only thing your uncle Marmaduke was ever\nknown to give to anybody.\"\n\nMarmaduke Paradine, his brother-in-law, was not a connection of whom he\nhad much reason to feel particularly proud. One of those persons endowed\nwith what are known as \"insinuating manners and address,\" he had, after\nsome futile attempts to enter the army, been sent out to Bombay as agent\nfor a Manchester firm, and in that capacity had contrived to be mixed up\nin some more than shady transactions with rival exporters and native\ndealers up the country, which led to an unceremonious dismissal by his\nemployers.\n\nHe had brought home the stone from India as a propitiatory token of\nremembrance, more portable and less expensive than the lacquered\ncabinets, brasses, stuffs and carved work which are expected from\nfriends at such a distance, and he had been received with pardon and\nstarted once more, until certain other proceedings of his, shadier\nstill, had obliged Paul to forbid him the house at Westbourne Terrace.\n\nSince then little had been heard of him, and the reports which reached\nMr. Bultitude of his disreputable relative's connection with the\npromotion of a series of companies of the kind affected by the widow and\ncurate, and exposed in money articles and law courts, gave him no\ndesire to renew his acquaintance.\n\n\"Isn't it a talisman, though?\" said Dick, rather unfortunately for any\nhopes he might have of persuading his father to entrust him with the\ncoveted treasure.\n\n\"I'm sure I can't tell you,\" yawned Paul, \"how do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know, only Uncle Duke once said something about it. Barbara\nheard him tell mamma. I say, perhaps it's like the one in Scott, and\ncures people of things, though I don't think it's that sort of talisman\neither, because I tried it once on my chilblains, and it wasn't a bit of\ngood. If you would only let me have it, perhaps I might find out, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"You might,\" said his father drily, apparently not much influenced by\nthis inducement, \"but you won't have the chance. If it has a secret, I\nwill find it out for myself\" (he little knew how literally he was to be\ntaken at his word), \"and, by the way, there's your cab--at last.\"\n\nThere was a sound of wheels outside, and, as Dick heard them, he grew\ndesperate in his extremity; a wish he had long secretly cherished\nunspoken, without ever hoping for courage to give it words, rose to his\nlips now; he got up and moved timidly towards his father.\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"there's something I want to say to you so much\nbefore I go. Do let me ask you now.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" said Paul. \"Make haste, you haven't much time.\"\n\n\"It's this. I want you to--to let me leave Grimstone's at the end of the\nterm.\"\n\nPaul stared at him, angry and incredulous, \"Let you leave Dr.\nGrimstone's (oblige me by giving him his full title when you speak of\nhim),\" he said slowly. \"Why, what do you mean? It's an excellent\nschool--never saw a better expressed prospectus in my life. And my old\nfriend Bangle, Sir Benjamin Bangle, who's a member of the School Board,\nand ought to know something about schools, strongly recommended\nit--would have sent his own son there, if he hadn't entered him at Eton.\nAnd when I pay for most of the extras for you too. Dancing, by Gad, and\nmeat for breakfast. I'm sure I don't know what you would have.\"\n\n\"I'd like to go to Marlborough, or Harrow, or somewhere,\" whimpered\nDick. \"Jolland's going to Harrow at Easter. (Jolland's one of the\nfellows at Grimstone's--Dr. Grimstone's I mean.) And what does old\nBangle know about it? He hasn't got to go there himself! And--and\nGrimstone's jolly enough to fellows he likes, but he doesn't like\n_me_--he's always sitting on me for something--and I hate some of the\nfellows there, and altogether it's beastly. Do let me leave! If you\ndon't want me to go to a public school, I--I could stop at home and have\na private tutor--like Joe Twitterley!\"\n\n\"It's all ridiculous nonsense, I tell you,\" said Paul angrily,\n\"ridiculous nonsense! And, once for all, I'll put a stop to it. I don't\napprove of public schools for boys like you, and, what's more, I can't\nafford it. As for private tutors, that's absurd! So you will just make\nup your mind to stay at Crichton House as long as I think proper to keep\nyou there, and there's an end of that!\"\n\nAt this final blow to all his hopes, Dick began to sob in a subdued\nhopeless kind of way, which was more than his father could bear. To do\nPaul justice, he had not meant to be quite so harsh when the boy was\nabout to set out for school, and, a little ashamed of his irritation, he\nsought to justify his decision.\n\nHe chose to do this by delivering a short homily on the advantages of\nschool, by which he might lead Dick to look on the matter in the calm\nlight of reason and common sense, and commonplaces on the subject began\nto rise to the surface of his mind, from the rather muddy depths to\nwhich they had long since sunk.\n\nHe began to give Dick the benefit of all this stagnant wisdom, with a\nfeeling of surprise as he went on, at his own powerful and original way\nof putting things.\n\n\"Now, you know, it's no use to cry like that,\" he began. \"It's--ah--the\nusual thing for boys at school, I'm quite aware, to go about fancying\nthey're very ill-used, and miserable, and all the rest of it, just as if\npeople in my position had their sons educated out of spite! It's one of\nthose petty troubles all boys have to go through. And you mark my words,\nmy boy, when they go out into the world and have real trials to put up\nwith, and grow middle-aged men, like me, why, they see what fools\nthey've been, Dick; they see what fools they've been. All the--hum, the\ninnocent games and delights of boyhood, and that sort of thing, you\nknow--come back to them--and then they look back to those hours passed\nat school as the happiest, aye, the very happiest time of their life!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick, \"then I hope it won't be the happiest time in mine,\nthat's all! And you may have been happy at the school you went to,\nperhaps, but I don't believe you would very much care about being a boy\nagain like me, and going back to Grimstone's, you know you wouldn't!\"\n\nThis put Paul on his mettle; he had warmed well to his subject, and\ncould not let this open challenge pass unnoticed--it gave him such an\nopening for a cheap and easy effect.\n\nHe still had the stone in his hand as he sank back into his chair,\nsmiling with a tolerant superiority.\n\n\"Perhaps you will believe me,\" he said, impressively, \"when I tell you,\nold as I am and much as you envy me, I only wish, at this very moment, I\ncould be a boy again, like you. Going back to school wouldn't make me\nunhappy, I can tell you.\"\n\nIt is so fatally easy to say more than we mean in the desire to make as\nstrong an impression as possible. Well for most of us that--more\nfortunate than Mr. Bultitude--we can generally do so without fear of\nbeing taken too strictly at our word.\n\nAs he spoke these unlucky words, he felt a slight shiver, followed by a\ncurious shrinking sensation all over him. It was odd, too, but the\narm-chair in which he sat seemed to have grown so much bigger all at\nonce. He felt a passing surprise, but concluded it must be fancy, and\nwent on as comfortably as before.\n\n\"I should like it, my boy, but what's the good of wishing? I only\nmention it to prove that I was not speaking at random. I'm an old man\nand you're a young boy, and, that being so, why, of course--What the\ndooce are you giggling about?\"\n\nFor Dick, after some seconds of half-frightened open-mouthed staring,\nhad suddenly burst into a violent fit of almost hysterical giggling,\nwhich he seemed trying vainly to suppress.\n\nThis naturally annoyed Mr. Bultitude, and he went on with immense\ndignity, \"I--ah--I'm not aware that I've been saying anything\nparticularly ridiculous. You seem to be amused?\"\n\n\"Don't!\" gasped Dick. \"It, it isn't anything you're saying--it's,\nit's--oh, can't you feel any difference?\"\n\n\"The sooner you go back to school the better!\" said Paul angrily. \"I\nwash my hands of you. When I do take the trouble to give you any advice,\nit's received with ridicule. You always were an ill-mannered little cub.\nI've had quite enough of this. Leave the room, sir!\"\n\nThe wheels must have belonged to some other cab, for none had stopped at\nthe pavement as yet; but Mr. Bultitude was justly indignant, and could\nstand the interview no longer. Dick, however, made no attempt to move;\nhe remained there, choking and shaking with laughter, while his father\nsat stiffly on his chair, trying to ignore his son's unmannerly conduct,\nbut only partially succeeding.\n\nNo one can calmly endure watching other people laughing at him like\nidiots, while he is left perfectly incapable of guessing what he has\nsaid or done to amuse them. Even when this is known, it requires a\npeculiarly keen sense of humour to see the point of a joke against\noneself.\n\nAt last his patience gave out, and he said coldly, \"Now, perhaps, if you\nare quite yourself again, you will be good enough to let me know what\nthe joke is?\"\n\nDick, looking flushed and half-ashamed, tried again and again to speak,\nbut each time the attempt was too much for him. After a time he did\nsucceed, but his voice was hoarse and shaken with laughter as he spoke.\n\"Haven't you found it out yet? Go and look at yourself in the glass--it\nwill make you roar!\"\n\nThere was the usual narrow sheet of plate glass at the back of the\nsideboard, and to this Mr. Bultitude walked, almost under protest, and\nwith a cold dignity. It occurred to him that he might have a smudge on\nhis face or something wrong with his collar and tie--something to\naccount to some extent for his son's frivolous and insulting behaviour.\nNo suspicion of the terrible truth crossed his mind as yet.\n\nMeanwhile Dick was looking on eagerly with a chuckle of anticipation, as\none who watches the dawning appreciation of an excellent joke.\n\nBut no sooner had Paul met the reflection in the glass than he started\nback in incredulous horror--then returned and stared again and again.\n\nSurely, surely, this could not be he!\n\nHe had expected to see his own familiar portly bow-windowed presence\nthere--but somehow, look as he would, the mirror insisted upon\nreflecting the figure of his son Dick. Could he possibly have become\ninvisible and have lost the power of casting a reflection--or how was it\nthat Dick, and only Dick, was to be seen there?\n\nHow was it, too, when he looked round, there was the boy still sitting\nthere? It could not be Dick, evidently, that he saw in the glass.\nBesides, the reflection opposite him moved when he moved, returned when\nhe returned, copied his every gesture!\n\nHe turned round upon his son with angry and yet hopeful suspicion. \"You,\nyou've been playing some of your infernal tricks with this mirror, sir,\"\nhe cried fiercely. \"What have you done to it?\"\n\n\"Done! how could I do anything to it? As if you didn't know that!\"\n\n\"Then,\" stammered Paul, determined to know the worst, \"then do you, do\nyou mean to tell me you can see any--alteration in me? Tell me the truth\nnow!\"\n\n\"I should just think I could!\" said Dick emphatically. \"It's very queer,\nbut just look here,\" and he came up to the sideboard and placed himself\nby the side of his horrified father. \"Why,\" he said, with another\ngiggle, \"we're--he-he--as like as two peas!\"\n\nThey were indeed; the glass reflected now two small boys, each with\nchubby cheeks and auburn hair, both dressed, too, exactly alike, in Eton\njackets and broad white collars; the only difference to be seen between\nthem was that, while one face wore an expression of intense glee and\nsatisfaction, the other--the one which Mr. Bultitude was beginning to\nfear must belong to him--was lengthened and drawn with dismay and\nbewilderment.\n\n\"Dick,\" said Paul faintly, \"what is all this? Who has been, been taking\nthese liberties with me?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" protested Dick. \"It wasn't me. I believe you\ndid it all yourself.\"\n\n\"Did it all myself!\" repeated Paul indignantly. \"Is it likely I should?\nIt's some trickery, I tell you, some villainous plot. The worst of it\nis,\" he added plaintively, \"I don't understand who I'm supposed to be\nnow. Dick, who am I?\"\n\n\"You can't be me,\" said Dick, \"because here I am, you know. And you're\nnot yourself, that's very plain. You must be _somebody_, I suppose,\" he\nadded dubiously.\n\n\"Of course I am. What do you mean?\" said Paul angrily. \"Never mind who\nI am. I feel just the same as I always did. Tell me when you first began\nto notice any change. Could you see it coming on at all, eh?\"\n\n\"It was all at once, just as you were talking about school and all that.\nYou said you only wished---- Why of course; look here, it must be the\nstone that did it!\"\n\n\"Stone! what stone?\" said Paul. \"I don't know what you're talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do--the GarudÃ¢ Stone! You've got it in your hand still. Don't\nyou see? It's a real talisman after all! How jolly!\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything to set it off; and besides, oh, it's perfectly\nabsurd! How can there be such things as talismans nowadays, eh? Tell me\nthat.\"\n\n\"Well, something's happened to you, hasn't it? And it must have been\ndone somehow,\" argued Dick.\n\n\"I was holding the confounded thing, certainly,\" said Paul, \"here it is.\nBut what could I have said to start it? What has it done this to me\nfor?\"\n\n\"I know!\" cried Dick. \"Don't you remember? You said you wished you were\na boy again, like me. So you are, you see, exactly like me! What a lark\nit is, isn't it? But, I say, you can't go up to business like that, you\nknow, can you? I tell you what, you'd better come to Grimstone's with me\nnow, and see how you like it. I shouldn't mind so much if you came too.\nGrimstone's face would be splendid when he saw two of us. Do come!\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous nonsense you're talking,\" said Paul, \"and you know\nit. What should I do at school at my age? I tell you I'm the same as\never inside, though I may have shrunk into a little rascally boy to look\nat. And it's simply an abominable nuisance, Dick, that's what it is! Why\non earth couldn't you let the stone alone? Just see what mischief\nyou've done by meddling now--put me to all this inconvenience!\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have wished,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Wished!\" echoed Mr. Bultitude. \"Why, to be sure,\" he said, with a gleam\nof returning hopefulness, \"of course--I never thought of that. The\nthing's a wishing stone; it must be! You have to hold it, I suppose, and\nthen say what you wish aloud, and there you are. If that's the case, I\ncan soon put it all right by simply wishing myself back again. I--I\nshall have a good laugh at all this by and by--I know I shall!\"\n\nHe took the stone, and got into a corner by himself where he began\nrepeating the words, \"I wish I was back again,\" \"I wish I was the man I\nwas five minutes ago,\" \"I wish all this had not happened,\" and so on,\nuntil he was very exhausted and red in the face. He tried with the stone\nheld in his left hand, as well as his right, sitting and standing, under\nall the various conditions he could think of, but absolutely nothing\ncame of it; he was just as exasperatingly boyish and youthful as ever at\nthe end of it.\n\n\"I don't like this,\" he said at last, giving it up with a rather\ncrestfallen air. \"It seems to me that this diabolical invention has got\nout of order somehow; I can't make it work any more!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested Dick, who had shown throughout the most\nunsympathetic cheerfulness, \"perhaps it's one of those talismans that\nonly give you one wish, and you've had it, you know?\"\n\n\"Then it's all over!\" groaned Paul. \"What the dooce am I to do? What\nshall I do? Suggest something, for Heaven's sake; don't stand cackling\nthere in that unfeeling manner. Can't you see what a terrible, mess I've\ngot into? Suppose--only suppose your sister or one of the servants were\nto come in, and see me like this!\"\n\nThis suggestion simply enchanted Dick. \"Let's have 'em all up,\" he\nlaughed; \"it would be such fun! How they will laugh when we tell them!\"\nAnd he rushed to the bell.\n\n\"Touch that bell if you dare!\" screamed Paul. \"I won't be seen in this\ncondition by anybody! What on earth could have induced that scoundrelly\nuncle of yours to bring such a horrible thing as this over I can't\nimagine! I never heard of such a situation as this in my life. I can't\nstay like this, you know--it's not to be thought of! I--I wonder whether\nit would be any use to send over to Dr. Bustard and ask him to step in;\nhe might give me something to bring me round. But then the whole\nneighbourhood would hear about it! If I don't see my way out of this\nsoon, I shall go raving mad!\"\n\nAnd he paced restlessly up and down the room with his brain on fire.\n\nAll at once, as he became able to think more coherently, there occurred\nto him a chance, slender and desperate enough, but still a chance, of\nescaping even yet the consequences of his folly.\n\nHe was forced to conclude that, however improbable and fantastic it\nmight appear in this rationalistic age, there must be some hidden power\nin this GarudÃ¢ Stone which had put him in his present very unpleasant\nposition. It was plain too that the virtues of the talisman refused to\nexert themselves any more at his bidding.\n\nBut it did not follow that in another's hands the spell would remain as\npowerless. At all events, it was an experiment well worth the trial, and\nhe lost no time in explaining the notion to Dick, who, by the sparkle in\nhis eyes and suppressed excitement in his manner, seemed to think there\nmight be something in it.\n\n\"I may as well try,\" he said, \"give it to me.\"\n\n\"Take it, my dear boy,\" said Paul, with a paternal air that sorely tried\nDick's recovered gravity, it contrasted so absurdly with his altered\nappearance. \"Take it, and wish your poor old father himself again!\"\n\nDick took it, and held it thoughtfully for some moments, while Paul\nwaited in nervous impatience. \"Isn't it any use?\" he said dolefully at\nlast, as nothing happened.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Dick calmly, \"I haven't wished yet.\"\n\n\"Then do so at once,\" said Paul fussily, \"do so at once. There's no time\nto waste, every moment is of importance--your cab will be here directly.\nAlthough, although I'm altered in this ridiculous way, I hope I still\nretain my authority as a father, and as a father, by Gad, I expect you\nto obey me, sir!\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Dick indifferently, \"you may keep the authority if\nyou like.\"\n\n\"Then do what I tell you. Can't you see how urgent it is that a scandal\nlike this shouldn't get about? I should be the laughing-stock of the\ncity. Not a soul must ever guess that such a thing has happened. You\nmust see that yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, who all this time was sitting on a corner of the\ntable, swinging his legs, \"I see that. It will be all right. I'm going\nto wish in a minute, and no one will guess there has been anything the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"That's a good boy!\" said Paul, much relieved, \"I know your heart is in\nthe right place--only do make haste.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" Dick asked, \"when you are yourself again, things would go\non just as usual?\"\n\n\"I--I hope so.\"\n\n\"I mean you will go on sitting here, and I shall go off to Grimstone's?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" said Paul; \"don't ask so many questions. I'm\nsure you quite understand what has to be done, so get on. We might be\nfound like this any minute.\"\n\n\"That settles it,\" said Dick, \"any fellow would do it after that.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but you're so slow about it!\"\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry,\" said Dick, \"you mayn't like it after all when\nI've done it.\"\n\n\"Done what?\" asked Mr. Bultitude sharply, struck by something sinister\nand peculiar in the boy's manner.\n\n\"Well, I don't mind telling you,\" said Dick, \"it's fairer. You see, you\nwished to be a boy just like me, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean it,\" protested Paul.\n\n\"Ah, you couldn't expect a stone to know that; at any rate, it made you\ninto a boy like me directly. Now, if I wish myself a man just like you\nwere ten minutes ago, before you took the stone, that will put things\nall right again, won't it?\"\n\n\"Is the boy mad?\" cried Paul, horrified at this proposal. \"Why, why,\nthat would be worse than ever!\"\n\n\"I don't see that,\" objected Dick, stubbornly. \"No one would know\nanything about it then.\"\n\n\"But, you little blockhead, can't I make you understand? It wouldn't do\nat all. We should both of us be wrong then--each with the other's\npersonal appearance.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick blandly, \"I shouldn't mind that.\"\n\n\"But I should--I mind very much. I object strongly to such a--such a\npreposterous arrangement. And what's more, I won't have it. Do you hear,\nI forbid you to think of any such thing. Give me back that stone. I\ncan't trust you with it after this.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said Dick doggedly. \"You've had your wish, and I\ndon't see why I shouldn't have mine. I mean to have it, too.\"\n\n\"Why, you unnatural little rascal!\" cried the justly-enraged father, \"do\nyou mean to defy me? I tell you I will have that stone! Give it up this\ninstant!\" and he made a movement towards his son, as if he meant to\nrecover the talisman by main force.\n\nBut Dick was too quick for him. Slipping off the table with great\nagility, he planted himself firmly on the hearth-rug, with the hand that\nheld the stone clenched behind his back, and the other raised in\nself-defence.\n\n\"I'd much rather you wouldn't make me hit you, you know,\" he said,\n\"because, in spite of what's happened, you're still my father, I\nsuppose. But if you interfere with me before I've done with this stone,\nI'm afraid I shall have to punch your head.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude retreated a few steps apprehensively, feeling himself no\nmatch for his son, except in size and general appearance; and for some\nmoments of really frightful intensity they stood panting on the\nhearth-rug, each cautiously watching the other, on his guard against\nstratagem and surprise.\n\nIt was one of those painful domestic scenes which are fortunately rare\nbetween father and son.\n\nOverhead, the latest rollicking French polka was being rattled out, with\na savage irony of which pianos, even by the best makers, can at times be\ncapable.\n\nSuddenly Dick drew himself up. \"Stand out of my way!\" he cried\nexcitedly, \"I am going to do it. I wish I was a man like you were just\nnow!\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, Mr. Bultitude had the bitterness of seeing his\nunscrupulous son swell out like the frog in the fable, till he stood\nthere before him the exact duplicate of what Paul had so lately been!\n\nThe transformed Dick began to skip and dance round the room in high\nglee, with as much agility as his increased bulk would allow. \"It's all\nright, you see,\" he said. \"The old stone's as good as ever. You can't\nsay anyone would ever know, to look at us.\"\n\nAnd then he threw himself panting into a chair, and began to laugh\nexcitedly at the success of his unprincipled manoeuvres.\n\nAs for Paul, he was perfectly furious at having been so outwitted and\noverreached. It was a long time before he could command his voice\nsufficiently to say, savagely: \"Well, you've had your way, and a pretty\nmess you've made of it. We're both of us in false positions now. I hope\nyou're satisfied, I'm sure. Do you think you'll care about going back to\nCrichton House in that state?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dick, very decidedly: \"I'm quite sure I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't help it. You've brought it on yourself; and, provided the\nDoctor sees no objection to take you back as you are and receive you as\none of his pupils, I shall most certainly send you there.\"\n\nPaul did not really mean this, he only meant to frighten him; for he\nstill trusted that, by letting Boaler into the secret, the charm might\nbe set in motion once more, and the difficulty comfortably overcome. But\nhis threat had a most unfortunate effect upon Dick; it hardened him to\ntake a course he might otherwise have shrunk from.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"you're going to do that? But doesn't it strike you that\nthings are rather altered with us now?\"\n\n\"They are, to a certain extent, of course,\" said Paul, \"through my folly\nand your wicked cunning; but a word or two of explanation from me----\"\n\n\"You'll find it will take more explanation than you think,\" said Dick;\n\"but, of course, you can try, if you think it worth while--when you get\nto Grimstone's.\"\n\n\"When I,--I don't understand. When I,--what did you say?\" gasped Paul.\n\n\"Why, you see,\" exclaimed Dick, \"it would never have done for us both to\ngo back; the chaps would have humbugged us so, and as I hate the place\nand you seem so fond of being a boy and going back to school and that, I\nthought perhaps it would be best for you to go and see how you liked\nit!\"\n\n\"I never will! I'll not stir from this room! I dare you to try to move\nme!\" cried Paul. And just then there was the sound of wheels outside\nonce more. They stopped before the house, the bell rang sharply--the\nlong-expected cab had come at last.\n\n\"You've no time to lose,\" said Dick, \"get your coat on.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude tried to treat the affair as a joke. He laughed a ghastly\nlittle laugh.\n\n\"Ha! ha! you've fairly caught your poor father this time; you've proved\nhim in the wrong. I admit I said more than I exactly meant. But that's\nenough. Don't drive a good joke too far; shake hands, and let us see if\nwe can't find a way out of this!\"\n\nBut Dick only warmed his coat tails at the fire as he said, with a very\nungenerous reminiscence of his father's manner: \"You are going back to\nan excellent establishment, where you will enjoy all the comforts of\nhome--I can specially recommend the stickjaw; look out for it on\nTuesdays and Fridays. You will once more take part in the games and\nlessons of happy boyhood. (Did you ever play 'chevy' when you were a boy\nbefore? You'll enjoy chevy.) And you will find your companions easy\nenough to get on with, if you don't go giving yourself airs; they won't\nstand airs. Now good-bye, my boy, and bless you!\"\n\nPaul stood staring stupidly at this outrageous assumption; he could\nscarcely believe yet that it was meant in cruel earnest. Before he could\nanswer, the door opened and Boaler appeared.\n\n\"Had a deal of trouble to find a keb, sir, on a night like this,\" he\nsaid to the false Dick, \"but the luggage is all on top, and the man says\nthere's plenty of time still.\"\n\n\"Good-bye then, my boy,\" said Dick, with well-assumed tenderness, but a\nrather dangerous light in his eye. \"My compliments to the Doctor,\nremember.\"\n\nPaul turned indignantly from him to the butler; he, at least, would\nstand by him. Boaler would not see a master who had always been fair, if\nnot indulgent, to him driven from his home in this cold-blooded manner!\n\nHe made two or three attempts to speak, for his brain whirled so with\nscathing, burning things to say. He would expose the fraud then and\nthere, and defy the impudent usurper; he would warn every one against\nthis spurious pinchbeck imitation of himself. The whole household should\nbe summoned and called upon to judge between the two!\n\nNo doubt, if he had had enough self-command to do all this effectually,\nwhile Dick had as yet not had the time thoroughly to adapt himself to\nhis altered circumstances, he might have turned the situation at the\noutset, and spared himself some very painful experiences.\n\nBut it is very often precisely those words which are the most vitally\nimportant to be said that refuse to pass our lips on a sudden emergency.\nWe feel all the necessity of saying something at once, but the necessary\nwords unaccountably desert us at the critical moment.\n\nMr. Bultitude felt himself in this unfortunate position. He made more\nwild efforts to explain, but the sense of his danger only petrified his\nmind instead of stimulating it. Then he was spared further conflict. A\ndark mist rose before his eyes; the walls of the room receded into\ninfinite space; and, with a loud singing in his ears, he fell, and\nseemed to himself to be sinking down, down, through the earth to the\nvery crust of the antipodes. Then the blackness closed over him--and he\nknew no more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. _In the Toils_\n\n     \"I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him\n     lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with\n     so old a head.\"--_Merchant of Venice_, Act iv.\n\n\nWhen Mr. Bultitude recovered his senses, which was not for a\nconsiderable time, he found that he was being jolted along through a\nbroad well-lit thoroughfare, in a musty four-wheeler.\n\nHis head was by no means clear yet, and for some minutes he could hardly\nbe said to think at all; he merely lay back dreamily listening to the\nhard grinding jar of the cab windows vibrating in their grooves.\n\nHis first distinct sensation was a vague wonder what Barbara might be\nintending to give him for dinner, for, oddly enough, he felt far from\nhungry, and was conscious that his palate would require the adroitest\nwitching.\n\nWith the thought of dinner his dining-room was almost inseparably\nassociated, and then, with an instant rush of recollection, the whole\nscene there with the GarudÃ¢ Stone surged into his brain. He shuddered as\nhe did so; it had all been so real, so hideously vivid and coherent\nthroughout. But all unpleasant impressions soon yielded to the delicious\nluxury of his present security.\n\nAs his last conscious moment had been passed in his own dining-room, the\nfact that he opened his eyes in a cab, instead of confirming his worst\nfears, actually helped to restore the unfortunate gentleman's serenity;\nfor he frequently drove home from the city in this manner, and believed\nhimself now, instead of being, as was actually the case, in that\nmarvellous region of cheap photography, rocking-horses, mild stone\nlions, and wheels and ladders--the Euston Road--to be bowling along\nHolborn.\n\nNow that he was thoroughly awake he found positive amusement in going\nover each successive incident of his nightmare experience with the\ntalisman, and smiling at the tricks his imagination had played him.\n\n\"I wonder now how the dickens I came to dream such outrageous nonsense!\"\nhe said to himself, for even his dreams were, as a rule, within the\nbounds of probability. But he was not long in tracing it to the devilled\nkidneys he had had at the club for lunch, and some curious old brown\nsherry Robinson had given him afterwards at his office.\n\n\"Gad, what a shock the thing has given me!\" he thought. \"I can hardly\nshake off the feeling even now.\"\n\nAs a rule, after waking up on the verge of a fearful crisis, the effect\nof the horror fades swiftly away, as one detail after another evades a\nmemory which is never too anxious to retain them, and each moment\nbrings a deeper sense of relief and self-congratulation.\n\nBut in Paul's case, curiously enough, as he could not help thinking, the\nmore completely roused he became, the greater grew his uneasiness.\n\nPerhaps the first indication of the truth was suggested to him by a\nlurking suspicion--which he tried to dismiss as mere fancy--that he\nfilled rather less of the cab than he had always been accustomed to do.\n\nTo reassure himself he set his thoughts to review all the proceedings of\nthat day, feeling that if he could satisfactorily account for the time\nup to his taking the cab, that would be conclusive as to the unreality\nof any thing that appeared to have happened later in his own house. He\ngot on well enough till he came to the hour at which he had left the\noffice, and then, search his memory as he would, he could not remember\nhailing any cab!\n\nCould it be another delusion, too, or was it the fact that he had found\nhimself much pressed for time and had come home by the Underground to\nPraed Street? It must have been the day before, but that was Sunday.\nSaturday, then? But the recollection seemed too recent and fresh; and\nbesides, on Saturday, he had left at two, and had taken Barbara to see\nMessrs. Maskelyne and Cooke's performance.\n\nSlowly, insidiously, but with irresistible force, the conviction crept\nupon him that he had dined, and dined well.\n\n\"If I have dined already,\" he told himself, \"I can't be going home to\ndinner; and if I am not going home to dinner, what--what am I doing in\nthis cab?\"\n\nThe bare idea that something might be wrong with him after all made him\nimpatient to put an end to all suspense. He must knock this scotched\nnightmare once for all on the head by a deliberate appeal to his senses.\n\nThe cab had passed the lighted shops now, and was driving between\nsquares and private houses, so that Mr. Bultitude had to wait until the\nsickly rays of a street lamp glanced into the cab for a moment, and, as\nthey did so, he put his feet up on the opposite seat and examined his\nboots and trousers with breathless eagerness.\n\nIt was not to be denied; they were not his ordinary boots, nor did he\never wear such trousers as he saw above them! Always a careful and\npunctiliously neat person, he was more than commonly exacting concerning\nthe make and polish of his boots and the set of his trousers.\n\nThese boots were clumsy, square-toed, and thick-soled; one was even\npatched on the side. The trousers were heavy and rough, of the kind\nadvertised as \"wear-resisting fabrics, suitable for youths at school,\"\nfrayed at the ends, and shiny--shamefully shiny--about the knees!\n\nIn hot despair he rapidly passed his hands over his body. It felt\nunusually small and slim, Mr. Bultitude being endowed with what is\neuphemistically termed a \"presence,\" and it was with an agony rarely\nfelt at such a discovery that he realised that, for the first time for\nmore than twenty years, he actually had a waist.\n\nThen, as a last resource, he took off his hat and felt for the broad,\nsmooth, egg-like surface, garnished by scanty side patches of thin hair,\nwhich he knew he ought to find.\n\nIt was gone--hidden under a crop of thick close curling locks!\n\nThis last disappointment completely overcame him; he had a kind of short\nfit in the cab as the bitter truth was brought home to him unmistakably.\n\nYes, this was no dream of a distempered digestion, but sober reality.\nThe whole of that horrible scene in the dining-room had really taken\nplace; and now he, Paul Bultitude, the widely-respected merchant of\nMincing Lane, a man of means and position, was being ignominiously\npacked off to school as if he were actually the schoolboy some hideous\njuggle had made him appear!\n\nIt was only with a violent effort that he could succeed in commanding\nhis thoughts sufficiently to decide on some immediate action. \"I must be\ncool,\" he kept muttering to himself, with shaking lips, \"quite cool and\ncollected. Everything will depend on that now!\"\n\nIt was some comfort to him in this extremity to recognise on the box the\nwell-known broad back of Clegg, a cabman who stabled his two horses in\nsome mews near Praed Street, and whom he had been accustomed to\npatronise in bad weather for several years.\n\nClegg would know him, in spite of his ridiculous transformation.\n\nHis idea was to stop the cab, and turn round and drive home again, when\nthey would find that he was not to be got rid of again quite so easily.\nIf Dick imagined he meant to put up tamely with this kind of treatment,\nhe was vastly mistaken; he would return home boldly and claim his\nrights!\n\nNo reasonable person could be perverse enough to doubt his identity when\nonce matters came to the proof; though at first, of course, he might\nfind a difficulty in establishing it. His children, his clerks, and his\nservants would soon get used to his appearance, and would learn to look\nbelow the mere surface, and then there was always the possibility of\nputting everything right by means of the magic stone.\n\n\"I won't lose a minute!\" he said aloud; and letting down the window,\nleaned out and shouted \"Stop!\" till he was hoarse.\n\nBut Clegg either could not or would not hear; he drove on at full speed,\na faster rate of progress than that adopted by most drivers of\nfour-wheeled cabs being one of his chief recommendations.\n\nThey were now passing Euston. It was a muggy, slushy night, with a thin\nbrown fog wreathing the houses and fading away above their tops into a\ndull, slate-blue sky. The wet street looked like a black canal; the\nblurred forms, less like vehicles than nondescript boats, moving over\nits inky surface, were indistinctly reflected therein; the gas-lights\nflared redly through the murky haze. It was not a pleasant evening in\nwhich to be out-of-doors.\n\nPaul would have opened the cab-door and jumped out had he dared, but his\nnerve failed him, and, indeed, considering the speed of the cab, the\nleap would have been dangerous to a far more active person. So he was\nforced to wait resignedly until the station should be reached, when he\ndetermined to make Clegg understand his purpose with as little loss of\ntime as possible.\n\n\"I must pay him something extra,\" he thought; \"I'll give him a sovereign\nto take me back.\" And he searched his pockets for the loose coin he\nusually carried about with him in such abundance; there was no gold in\nany of them.\n\nHe found, however, a variety of minor and less negotiable articles,\nwhich he fished out one by one from unknown depths--a curious\ncollection. There was a stumpy German-silver pencil case, a broken prism\nfrom a crystal chandelier, a gilded Jew's harp, a little book in which\nthe leaves on being turned briskly, gave a semblance of motion to the\nsails of a black windmill drawn therein, a broken tin soldier, some\nHong-Kong coppers with holes in them, and a quantity of little cogged\nwheels from the inside of a watch; while a further search was rewarded\nby an irregular lump of toffee imperfectly enfolded in sticky brown\npaper.\n\nHe threw the whole of these treasures out of the window with\nindescribable disgust, and, feeling something like a purse in a side\npocket, opened it eagerly.\n\nIt held five shillings exactly, the coins corresponding to those he had\npushed across to his son such a little while ago! It did not seem to him\nquite such a magnificent sum now as it had done then; he had shifted his\npoint of view.\n\nIt was too clear that the stone must have carried out his thoughtless\nwish with scrupulous and conscientious exactness in every detail. He had\nwanted, or said he wanted, to be a boy again like Dick, and accordingly\nhe had become a perfect duplicate, even to the contents of the pockets.\nEvidently nothing on the face of things showed the slightest difference.\nYet--and here lay the sting of the metamorphosis--he was conscious under\nit all of being his old original self, in utter discordance with the\nyouthful form in which he was an unwilling prisoner.\n\nBy this time the cab had driven up the sharp incline, and under the high\npointed archway of St. Pancras terminus, and now drew up with a jerk\nagainst the steps leading to the booking office.\n\nPaul sprang out at once in a violent passion. \"Here, you, Clegg!\" he\nsaid, \"why the devil didn't you pull up when I told you? eh?\"\n\nClegg was a burly, red-faced man, with a husky voice and a general\nmanner which conveyed the impression that he regarded teetotalism, as a\nprinciple, with something more than disapproval.\n\n\"Why didn't I pull up?\" he said, bending stiffly down from his box.\n\"'Cause I didn't want to lose a good customer, that's why I didn't pull\nup!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you don't know me?\"\n\n\"Know yer?\" said Clegg, with an approach to sentiment: \"I've knowed yer\nwhen you was a babby in frocks. I've knowed yer fust nuss (and a fine\nyoung woman she were till she took to drinking, as has been the ruin of\nmany). I've knowed yer in Infancy's hour and in yer byhood's bloom! I've\ndruv yer to this 'ere werry station twice afore. Know yer!\"\n\nPaul saw the uselessness of arguing with him. \"Then, ah--drive me back\nat once. Let those boxes alone. I--I've important business at home which\nI'd forgotten.\"\n\nClegg gave a vinous wink. \"Lor, yer at it agin,\" he said with\nadmiration. \"What a artful young limb it is! But it ain't what yer may\ncall good enough, so to speak, it ain't. Clegg don't do that no more!\"\n\n\"Don't do what?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"Don't drive no young gents as is a-bein' sent to school back agin into\ntheir family's bosims,\" said Clegg sententiously. \"You was took ill\nsudden in my cab the larst time. Offal bad you was, to be sure--to hear\nye, and I druv' yer back; and I never got no return fare, I didn't, and\nyer par he made hisself downright nasty over it, said as if it occurred\nagin he shouldn't employ me no more. I durstn't go and offend yer par;\nhe's a good customer to me, he is.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a sovereign to do it,\" said Paul.\n\n\"If yer wouldn't tell no tales, I might put yer down at the corner\np'raps,\" said Clegg, hesitating, to Paul's joy; \"not as it ain't cheap\nat that, but let's see yer suffering fust. Why,\" he cried with lofty\ncontempt as he saw from Paul's face that the coin was not producible,\n\"y'ain't got no suffering! Garn away, and don't try to tempt a pore\ncabby as has his livin' to make. What d'ye think of this, porter, now?\n'Ere's a young gent a tryin' to back out o' going to school when he\nought to be glad and thankful as he's receivin' the blessin's of a good\neddication. Look at me. I'm a 'ard-workin' man. I am. I ain't 'ad no\neddication. The kids, they're a learnin' French, and free'and drorin,\nand the bones on a skellington at the Board School, and I pays my\ncoppers down every week cheerful. And why, porter? Why, young master?\n'Cause I knows the vally on it! But when I sees a real young gent a\ndespisin' of the oppertoonities as a bountiful Providence and a\nexcellent par has 'eaped on his 'ed, it--it makes me sick, it inspires\nClegg with a pity and a contemp' for such ingratitood, which he cares\nnot for to 'ide from public voo!\"\n\nClegg delivered this harangue with much gesture and in a loud tone,\nwhich greatly edified the porters and disgusted Mr. Bultitude.\n\n\"Go away,\" said the latter, \"that's enough. You're drunk!\"\n\n\"Drunk!\" bellowed the outraged Clegg, rising on the box in his wrath.\n\"'Ear that. 'Ark at this 'ere young cock sparrer as tells a fam'ly man\nlike Clegg as he's drunk! Drunk, after drivin' his par in this 'ere\nwerry cab through frost and fine fifteen year and more! I wonder yer\ndon't say the old 'orse is drunk; you'll be sayin' that next! Drunk! oh,\ncert'nly, by all means. Never you darken my cab doors no more. I shall\ntake and tell your par, I shall. Drunk, indeed! A ill-conditioned young\nwiper as ever I see. Drunk! yah!\"\n\nAnd with much cursing and growling, Clegg gathered up his reins and\ndrove off into the fog, Boaler having apparently pre-paid the fare.\n\n\"Where for, sir, please?\" said a porter, who had been putting the\nplaybox and portmanteau on a truck during the altercation.\n\n\"Nowhere,\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"I--I'm not going by this train; find me\na cab with a sober driver.\"\n\nThe porter looked round. A moment before there had been several cabs\ndischarging their loads at the steps; now the last had rolled away\nempty.\n\n\"You might find one inside the station by the arrival platform,\" he\nsuggested; \"but there'll be sure to be one comin' up here in another\nminute, sir, if you like to wait.\"\n\nPaul thought the other course might be the longer one, and decided to\nstay where he was. So he walked into the lofty hall in which the booking\noffices are placed and waited there by the huge fire that blazed in the\nstove until he should hear the cab arrive which could take him back to\nWestbourne Terrace.\n\nOne or two trains were about to start, and the place was full. There\nwere several Cambridge men \"going up\" after the Christmas vacation, in\nevery variety of ulster; some tugging at refractory white terriers, one\nor two entrusting bicycles to dubious porters with many cautions and\ndirections. There were burly old farmers going back to their quiet\ncountryside, flushed with the prestige of a successful stand under\ncross-examination in some witness-box at the Law Courts; to tell and\nretell the story over hill and dale, in the market-place and\nbar-parlour, every week for the rest of their honest lives. There was\nthe usual pantomime \"rally\" on a mild scale, with real frantic\npassengers, and porters, and trucks, and trays of lighted lamps.\n\nPresently, out of the crowd and confusion, a small boy in a thick pilot\njacket and an immensely tall hat, whom Paul had observed looking at him\nintently for some time, walked up to the stove and greeted him\nfamiliarly.\n\n\"Hallo, Bultitude!\" he said, \"I thought it was you. Here we are again,\neh? Ugh!\" and he giggled dismally.\n\nHe was a pale-faced boy with freckles, very light green eyes, long,\nrather ragged black hair, a slouching walk, and a smile half-simpering,\nhalf-impudent.\n\nMr. Bultitude was greatly staggered by the presumption of so small a boy\nventuring to address him in this way. He could only stare haughtily.\n\n\"You might find a word to say to a fellow!\" said the boy in an aggrieved\ntone. \"Look here; come and get your luggage labelled.\"\n\n\"I don't want it labelled,\" said Paul stiffly, feeling bound to say\nsomething. \"I'm waiting for a cab to take me home again.\"\n\nThe other gave a loud whistle. \"That'll make it rather a short term,\nwon't it, if you're going home for the holidays already? You're a cool\nchap, Bultitude! If I were to go back to my governor now, he wouldn't\nsee it. It would put him in no end of a bait. But you're chaffing----\"\n\nPaul walked away from him with marked coolness. He was not going to\ntrouble himself to talk to his son's schoolfellows.\n\n\"Aren't you well?\" said the boy, not at all discouraged by his\nreception, following him and taking his arm. \"Down in the mouth? It is\nbeastly, isn't it, having to go back to old Grimstone's! The snow gave\nus an extra week, though--we've that much to be thankful for. I wish it\nwas the first day of the holidays again, don't you? What's the matter\nwith you? What have I done to put you in a wax?\"\n\n\"Nothing at present,\" said Paul. \"I don't speak to you merely because I\ndon't happen to have the--ah--pleasure of your acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, then; I daresay you know best,\" said the other huffily.\n\"Only I thought--considering we came the same half, and have been chums,\nand always sat next one another ever since--you might perhaps just\nrecollect having met me before, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't,\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"I tell you I haven't the least\nidea what your name is. The fact is there has been a slight mistake,\nwhich I can't stop to talk about now. There's a cab just driven up\noutside now. You must excuse me, really, my boy, I want to go.\"\n\nHe tried to work his arm free from the close and affectionate grip of\nhis unwelcome companion, who was regarding him with a sort of admiring\nleer.\n\n\"What a fellow you are, Bultitude!\" he said; \"always up to something or\nother. You know me well enough. What is the use of keeping it up any\nlonger? Let's talk, and stop humbugging. How much grub have you brought\nback this time?\"\n\nTo be advised to stop humbugging, and be persecuted with such idle\nquestions as these, maddened the poor gentleman. A hansom really had\nrolled up to the steps outside. He must put an end to this waste of\nprecious time, and escape from this highly inconvenient small boy.\n\nHe forced his way to the door, the boy still keeping fast hold of his\narm. Fortunately the cab was still there, and its late occupant, a tall,\nbroad man, was standing with his back to them paying the driver. Paul\nwas only just in time.\n\n\"Porter!\" he cried. \"Where's that porter? I want my box put on that cab.\nNo, I don't care about the luggage; engage the cab. Now, you little\nruffian, are you going to let me go? Can't you see I'm anxious to get\naway?\"\n\nJolland giggled more impishly than ever. \"Well, you _have_ got cheek!\"\nhe said. \"Go on, I wish you may get that cab, I'm sure!\"\n\nPaul, thus released, was just hurrying towards the cab, when the\nstranger who had got out of it settled the fare with satisfaction to\nhimself and turned sharply round.\n\nThe gas-light fell full on his face, and Mr. Bultitude recognised that\nthe form and features were those of no stranger--he had stumbled upon\nthe very last person he had expected or desired to meet just then--his\nflight was intercepted by his son's schoolmaster, Dr. Grimstone himself!\n\nThe suddenness of the shock threw him completely off his balance. In an\nordinary way the encounter would not of course have discomposed him, but\nnow he would have given worlds for presence of mind enough either to\nrush past to the cab and secure his only chance of freedom before the\nDoctor had fully realised his intention, or else greet him affably and\ncalmly, and, taking him quietly aside, explain his awkward position with\nan easy man-of-the-world air, which would ensure instant conviction.\n\nBut both courses were equally impossible. He stood there, right in Dr.\nGrimstone's path, with terrified starting eyes and quivering limbs, more\nlike an unhappy guinea-pig expecting the advances of a boa, than a\nBritish merchant in the presence of his son's schoolmaster! He was sick\nand faint with alarm, and the consciousness that appearances were all\nagainst him.\n\nThere was nothing in the least extraordinary in the fact of the Doctor's\npresence at the station. Mr. Bultitude might easily have taken this\ninto account as a very likely contingency and have provided accordingly,\nhad he troubled to think, for it was Dr. Grimstone's custom, upon the\nfirst day of the term, to come up to town and meet as many of his pupils\nupon the platform as intended to return by a train previously specified\nat the foot of the school-bills; and Paul had even expressly insisted\nupon Dick's travelling under surveillance in this manner, thinking it\nnecessary to keep him out of premature mischief.\n\nIt makes a calamity doubly hard to bear when one looks back and sees by\nwhat a trivial chance it has come upon us, and how slight an effort\nwould have averted it altogether; and Mr. Bultitude cursed his own\nstupidity as he stood there, rooted to the ground, and saw the hansom (a\n\"patent safety\" to him in sober earnest) drive off and abandon him to\nhis fate.\n\nDr. Grimstone bore down heavily upon him and Jolland, who had by this\ntime come up. He was a tall and imposing personage, with a strong black\nbeard and small angry grey eyes, slightly blood-tinged; he wore garments\nof a semi-clerical cut and colour, though he was not in orders. He held\nout a hand to each with elaborate geniality.\n\n\"Ha, Bultitude, my boy, how are you? How are you, Jolland? Come back\nbraced in body and mind by your vacation, eh? That's as it should be.\nHave you tickets? No? follow me then. You're both over age, I believe.\nThere you are; take care of them.\"\n\nAnd before Paul could protest, he had purchased tickets for all three,\nafter which he laid an authoritative hand upon Mr. Bultitude's shoulder\nand walked him out through the booking hall upon the platform.\n\n\"This is awful,\" thought Paul, shrinking involuntarily; \"simply awful.\nHe evidently has no idea who I really am. Unless I'm very careful I\nshall be dragged off to Crichton House before I can put him right. If I\ncould only get him away alone somewhere.\"\n\nAs if in answer to the wish, the Doctor guided him by a slight pressure\nstraight along by the end of the station, saying to Jolland as he did\nso, \"I wish to have a little serious conversation with Richard in\nprivate. Suppose you go to the bookstall and see if you can find out any\nof our young friends. Tell them to wait for me there.\"\n\nWhen they were alone the Doctor paced solemnly along in silence for some\nmoments, while Paul, who had always been used to consider himself a\nfairly prominent object, whatever might be his surroundings, began to\nfeel an altogether novel sensation of utter insignificance upon that\nimmense brown plain of platform and under the huge span of the arches\nwhose girders were lost in wreaths of mingled fog and smoke.\n\nStill he had some hope. Was it not possible, after all, that the Doctor\nhad divined his secret and was searching for words delicate enough to\nconvey his condolences?\n\n\"I wished to tell you, Bultitude,\" said the Doctor presently, and his\nfirst words dashed all Paul's rising hopes, \"that I hope you are\nreturning this term with the resolve to do better things. You have\ncaused your excellent father much pain in the past. You little know the\ngrief a wilful boy can inflict on his parent.\"\n\n\"I think I have a very fair idea of it,\" thought Paul, but he said\nnothing.\n\n\"I hope you left him in good health? Such a devoted parent,\nRichard--such a noble heart!\"\n\nAt any other time Mr. Bultitude might have felt gratified by these\neulogies, but just then he was conscious that he could lay no claim to\nthem. It was Dick who had the noble heart now, and he himself felt even\nless of a devoted parent than he looked.\n\n\"I had a letter from him during the vacation,\" continued Dr. Grimstone,\n\"a sweet letter, Richard, breathing in every line a father's anxiety and\nconcern for your welfare.\"\n\nPaul was a little staggered. He remembered having written, but he would\nscarcely perhaps have described his letter as \"sweet,\" as he had not\ndone much more than enclose a cheque for his son's account and object to\nthe items for pew-rent and scientific lectures with the diorama as\nexcessive.\n\n\"But--and this is what I wanted to say to you, Bultitude--his is no\nblind doting affection. He has implored me, for your own sake, if I see\nyou diverging ever so slightly from the path of duty, not to stay my\nhand. And I shall not forget his injunctions.\"\n\nA few minutes ago, and it would have seemed to Paul so simple and easy a\nmatter to point out to the Doctor the very excusable error into which he\nhad fallen. It was no more than he would have to do repeatedly upon his\nreturn, and here was an excellent opportunity for an explanation.\n\nBut, somehow the words would not come. The schoolmaster's form seemed so\ntremendous and towering, and he so feeble and powerless before him, that\nhe soon persuaded himself that a public place, like a station platform,\nwas no scene for domestic revelations of so painful a character.\n\nHe gave up all idea of resistance at present. \"Perhaps I had better\nleave him in his error till we get into the train,\" he thought; \"then we\nwill get rid of that other boy, and I can break it to him gradually in\nthe railway carriage as I get more accustomed to him.\"\n\nBut in spite of his determination to unbosom himself without further\ndelay, he knew that a kind of fascinated resignation was growing upon\nhim and gaining firmer hold each minute.\n\nSomething must be done to break the spell and burst the toils which were\nbeing woven round him before all effort became impossible.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Doctor, glancing up at the great clock-face on which\na reflector cast a patch of dim yellow light, \"we must be thinking of\nstarting. But don't forget what I have said.\"\n\nAnd they walked back towards the book-stalls with their cheery warmth\nof colour, past the glittering buffet, and on up the platform, to a part\nwhere six boys of various sizes were standing huddled forlornly together\nunder a gaslight.\n\n\"Aha!\" said Dr. Grimstone, with a slight touch of the ogre in his tone,\n\"more of my fellows, eh? We shall be quite a party. How do you do, boys?\nWelcome back to your studies.\"\n\nAnd the six boys came forward, all evidently in the lowest spirits, and\nraised their tall hats with a studied politeness.\n\n\"Some old friends here, Bultitude,\" said the Doctor, impelling the\nunwilling Paul towards the group. \"You know Tipping, of course; Coker,\ntoo, you've met before--and Coggs. How are you, Siggers? You're looking\nwell. Ah, by the way, I see a new face--Kiffin, I think? Kiffin, this is\nBultitude, who will make himself your mentor, I hope, and initiate you\ninto our various manners and customs.\"\n\nAnd, with a horrible dream-like sense of unreality, Mr. Bultitude found\nhimself being greeted by several entire strangers with a degree of\nwarmth embarrassing in the extreme.\n\nHe would have liked to protest and declare himself there and then in his\ntrue colours, but if this had been difficult alone with the Doctor under\nthe clock, it was impossible now, and he submitted ruefully enough to\ntheir unwelcome advances.\n\nTipping, a tall, red-haired, raw-boned boy, with sleeves and trousers he\nhad outgrown, and immense boots, wrung Paul's hand with misdirected\nenergy, saying \"how-de-do?\" with a gruff superiority, mercifully\ntempered by a touch of sheepishness.\n\nCoggs and Coker welcomed him with open arms as an equal, while Siggers,\na short, slight, sharp-featured boy, with a very fashionable hat and\nshirt-collars, and a horse-shoe pin, drawled, \"How are you, old boy?\"\nwith the languor of a confirmed man about town.\n\nThe other two were Biddlecomb, a boy with a blooming complexion and a\nsingularly sweet voice, and the new-comer, Kiffin, who did not seem much\nmore at home in the society of other boys than Mr. Bultitude himself,\nfor he kept nervously away from them, shivering with the piteous\nself-abandonment of an Italian greyhound.\n\nPaul was now convinced that unless he exerted himself considerably, his\nidentity with his son would never even be questioned, and the danger\nroused him to a sudden determination.\n\nHowever his face and figure might belie him, nothing in his speech or\nconduct should encourage the mistake. Whatever it might cost him to\novercome his fear of the Doctor, he would force himself to act and talk\nostentatiously, as much like his own ordinary self as possible, during\nthe journey down to Market Rodwell, so as to prepare the Doctor's mind\nfor the disclosures he meant to make at the earliest opportunity. He was\nbeginning to see that the railway carriage, with all those boys sitting\nby and staring, would be an inconvenient place for so delicate and\ndifficult a confession.\n\nThe guard having warned intending passengers to take their seats, and\nJolland, who had been unaccountably missing all this time, having\nappeared from the direction of the refreshment buffet, furtively\nbrushing away some suspicious-looking flakes and crumbs from his coat,\nand contrived to join the party unperceived, they all got into a\nfirst-class compartment--Paul with the rest.\n\nHe longed for moral courage to stand out boldly and refuse to leave\ntown, but, as we have seen, it was beyond his powers, and he temporised.\nVery soon the whistle had sounded and the train had begun to glide\nslowly out beyond the platform and arch, past the signal boxes and long\nlow sheds and offices which are the suburbs of a large terminus--and\nthen it was too late.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. _A Minnow amongst Tritons_\n\n     \"Boys are capital fellows in their own way among their mates; but\n     they are unwholesome companions for grown people.\"--_Essays of\n     Elia._\n\n\nFor some time after they were fairly started the Doctor read his evening\npaper with an air of impartial but severe criticism, and Mr. Bultitude\nas he sat opposite him next to the window, found himself overwhelmed\nwith a new and very unpleasant timidity.\n\nHe knew that, if he would free himself, this utterly unreasonable\nfeeling must be wrestled with and overcome; that now, if ever, was the\ntime to assert himself, and prove that he was anything but the raw youth\nhe was conscious of appearing. He had merely to speak and act, too, in\nhis ordinary everyday manner; to forget as far as possible the change\nthat had affected his outer man, which was not so very difficult to do\nafter all--and yet his heart sank lower and lower as each fresh\ntelegraph post flitted past.\n\n\"I will let him speak first,\" he thought; \"then I shall be able to feel\nmy way.\" But there was more fear than caution in the resolve.\n\nAt last, however, the Doctor laid down his paper, and, looking round\nwith the glance of proprietorship on his pupils, who had relapsed into a\ndecorous and gloomy silence, observed: \"Well, boys, you have had an\nunusually protracted vacation this time--owing to the unprecedented\nseverity of the weather. We must try to make up for it by the zest and\nardour with which we pursue our studies during the term. I intend to\nreduce the Easter holidays by a week by way of compensation.\"\n\nThis announcement (which by no means relieved the general\ndepression--the boys receiving it with a sickly interest) was good news\nto Paul, and even had the effect of making him forget his position for\nthe time.\n\n\"I'm uncommonly glad to hear it, Dr. Grimstone,\" he said heartily, \"an\nexcellent arrangement. Boys have too many holidays as it is. There's no\nreason, to my mind, why parents should be the sufferers by every\nsnowstorm. It's no joke, I can assure you, to have a great idle boy\nhanging about the place eating his empty head off!\"\n\nA burglar enlarging upon the sanctity of the law of property, or a sheep\nexposing the fallacies of vegetarianism, could hardly have produced a\ngreater sensation.\n\nEvery boy was roused from his languor to stare and wonder at these\ntraitorous sentiments, which, from the mouth of any but a known and\ntried companion, would have roused bitter hostility and contempt. As it\nwas, their wonder became a rapturous admiration, and they waited for the\nsituation to develop with a fearful and secret joy.\n\nIt was some time before the Doctor quite recovered himself; then he said\nwith a grim smile, \"This is indeed finding Saul amongst the prophets;\nyour sentiments, if sincere, Bultitude--I repeat, if sincere--are very\ncreditable. But I am obliged to look upon them with suspicion!\" Then, as\nif to dismiss a doubtful subject, he inquired generally, \"And how have\nyou all been spending your holidays, eh!\"\n\nThere was no attempt to answer this question, it being felt probably\nthat it was, like the conventional \"How do you do?\" one to which an\nanswer is neither desired nor expected, especially as he continued\nalmost immediately, \"I took my boy Tom up to town the week before\nChristmas to see the representation of the 'Agamemnon' at St. George's\nHall. The 'Agamemnon,' as most of you are doubtless aware, is a drama by\nÃschylus, a Greek poet of established reputation. I was much pleased by\nthe intelligent appreciation Tom showed during the performance. He\ndistinctly recognised several words from his Greek Grammar in the course\nof the dialogue.\"\n\nNo one seemed capable of responding except Mr. Bultitude, who dashed\ninto the breach with an almost pathetic effort to maintain his\naccustomed stiffness.\n\n\"I may be old-fashioned,\" he said, \"very likely I am; but\nI--ah--decidedly disapprove of taking children to dramatic exhibitions\nof any kind. It unsettles them, sir--unsettles them!\"\n\nDr. Grimstone made no answer, but he put a hand on each knee, and glared\nwith pursed lips and a leonine bristle of the beard at his youthful\ncritic for some moments, after which he returned to his _Globe_ with a\nshort ominous cough.\n\n\"I've offended him now,\" thought Paul. \"I must be more careful what I\nsay. But I'll get him into conversation again presently.\"\n\nSo he began at the first opportunity: \"You have this evening's paper, I\nsee. No telegrams of importance, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said the Doctor shortly.\n\n\"I saw a report in to-day's _Times_,\" said poor Mr. Bultitude, with a\ndesperate attempt at his most conversational and instructive manner, \"I\nsaw a report that the camphor crop was likely to be a failure this\nseason. Now, it's a very singular thing about camphor, that the\nJapanese----\" (he hoped to lead the conversation round to colonial\nproduce, and thus open the Doctor's eyes by the extent of his\nacquaintance with the subject).\n\n\"I am already acquainted with the method of obtaining camphor, thank\nyou, Bultitude,\" said the Doctor, with dangerous politeness.\n\n\"I was about to observe, when you interrupted me,\" said Paul, \"(and this\nis really a fact that I doubt if you are aware of), that the Japanese\nnever----\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the Doctor, with some impatience, \"probably they\nnever do, sir, but I shall have other opportunities of finding out what\nyou have read about the Japanese.\"\n\nBut he glanced over the top of the paper at the indignant Paul, who was\nnot accustomed to have his information received in this manner, with\nless suspicion and a growing conviction that some influence during the\nholidays had changed the boy from a graceless young scapegrace into a\nprig of the first water.\n\n\"He's most uncivil\"--Mr. Bultitude told himself--\"almost insulting, but\nI'll go on. I'm rousing his curiosity. I'm making way with him; he sees\na difference already.\" And so he applied himself once more.\n\n\"You're a smoker, of course, Dr. Grimstone?\" he began. \"We don't stop\nanywhere, I think, on the way, and I must confess myself, after dinner,\na whiff or two--I think I can give you a cigar you'll appreciate.\"\n\nAnd he felt for his cigar-case, really forgetting that it was gone, like\nall other incidents of his old self; while Jolland giggled with\nunrestrained delight at such charming effrontery.\n\n\"If I did not know, sir,\" said the Doctor, now effectually roused, \"that\nthis was ill-timed buffoonery, and not an intentional insult, I should\nbe seriously angry. As it is, I can overlook any exuberance of mirth\nwhich is, perhaps, pardonable when the mind is elated by the return to\nthe cheerful bustle and activity of school-life. But be very careful.\"\n\n\"He needn't be so angry,\" thought Paul, \"how could I know he doesn't\nsmoke? But I'm afraid he doesn't quite know me, even now.\"\n\nSo he began again: \"Did I hear you mention the name of Kiffin amongst\nthose of your pupils here, Doctor? I thought so. Not the son of Jordan\nKiffin, of College Hill, surely? Yes? Why, bless my soul, your father\nand I, my little fellow, were old friends in days before you were born\nor thought of--born or thought of. He was in a very small way then, a\nvery small---- Eh, Dr. Grimstone, don't you feel well?\"\n\n\"I see what you're aiming at, sir. You wish to prove to me that I'm\nmaking a mistake in my treatment of you.\"\n\n\"That was my idea, certainly,\" said Paul, much pleased. \"I'm very glad\nyou take me, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I shall take you in a way you won't appreciate soon, if this goes on,\"\nsaid the Doctor under his breath.\n\n\"When the time comes I shall know how to deal with you. Till then\nyou'll have the goodness to hold your tongue,\" he said aloud.\n\n\"It's not a very polite way of putting it,\" Paul said to himself, \"but,\nat any rate, he sees how the case stands now, and after all, perhaps, he\nonly speaks like that to put the boys off the scent. If so, it's\nuncommonly considerate and thoughtful of him, by Gad. I won't say any\nmore.\"\n\nBut by-and-by, the open window made him break his resolution. \"I'm sorry\nto inconvenience you, Dr. Grimstone,\" he said, with the air of one used\nto having his way in these matters, \"but I positively must ask you\neither to allow me to have this window up or to change places with you.\nThe night air, sir, at this time of the year is fatal, my doctor tells\nme, simply fatal to a man of my constitution.\"\n\nThe Doctor pulled up the window with a frown, and yet a somewhat puzzled\nexpression. \"I warn you, Bultitude,\" he said, \"you are acting very\nimprudently.\"\n\n\"So I am,\" thought Paul, \"so I am. Good of him to remind me. I must keep\nit up before all these boys. This unpleasant business mustn't get about.\nI'll hold my tongue till we get in. Then, I daresay, Grimstone will see\nme off by the next train up, if there is one, and lend me enough for a\nbed at an hotel for the night. I couldn't get to St. Pancras till very\nlate, of course. Or he might offer to put me up at the school. If he\ndoes, I think I shall very possibly accept. It might be better.\"\n\nAnd he leant back in his seat in a much easier frame of mind; it was\nannoying, of course, to have been turned out of his warm dining-room,\nand sent all the way down to Market Rodwell on a fool's errand like\nthis; but still, if nothing worse came of it, he could put up with the\ntemporary inconvenience, and it was a great relief to be spared the\nnecessity of an explanation.\n\nThe other boys watched him furtively with growing admiration, which\nexpressed itself in subdued whispers, varied by little gurgles and\n\"squirks\" of laughter; they tried to catch his eye and stimulate him to\nfurther feats of audacity, but Mr. Bultitude, of course, repulsed all\nsuch overtures with a coldness and severity which at once baffled and\npiqued them.\n\nAt last his eccentricity took a shape which considerably lessened their\nenthusiasm. Kiffin, the new boy, occupied the seat next to Paul; he was\na nervous-looking little fellow, with a pale face and big pathetic brown\neyes like a seal's, and his dress bore plain evidence of a mother's\ncareful supervision, having all the uncreased trimness and specklessness\nrarely to be observed except in the toilettes of the waxen prodigies in\na shop-window.\n\nIt happened that, as he lay back in the padded seat between the\nsheltering partitions, watching the sickly yellow dregs of oil surging\ndismally to and fro with the motion in the lamp overhead, or the black\nindistinct forms flitting past through the misty blue outside, the\npathos of his situation became all at once too much for him.\n\nHe was a home-bred boy, without any of that taste for the companionship\nand pursuits of his fellows, or capacity for adapting himself to their\nprejudices and requirements, which give some home-bred boys a ready\npassport into the roughest communities.\n\nHis heart throbbed with no excited curiosity, no conscious pride, at\nthis his first important step in life; he was a forlorn little stranger,\nin an unsympathetic strange land, and was only too well aware of his\nposition.\n\nSo that it is not surprising that as he thought of the home he had left\nan hour or two ago which now seemed so shadowy, so inaccessible and\nremote, his eyes began to smart and sting, and his chest to heave\nominously, until he felt it necessary to do something to give a partial\nvent to his emotions and prevent a public and disgraceful exhibition of\ngrief.\n\nUnhappily for him he found this safety-valve in a series of suppressed\nbut distinctly audible sniffs.\n\nMr. Bultitude bore this for some time with no other protest than an\noccasional indignant bounce or a lowering frown in the offender's\ndirection, but at last his nerves, strung already to a high pitch by all\nhe had undergone, could stand it no longer.\n\n\"Dr. Grimstone,\" he said with polite determination, \"I'm not a man to\ncomplain without good reason, but really I must ask you to interfere.\nWill you tell this boy here, on my right, either to control his feelings\nor to cry into his pocket-handkerchief, like an ordinary human being? A\ngood honest bellow I can understand, but this infernal whiffling and\nsniffing, sir, I will not put up with. It's nothing less than unnatural\nin a boy of that size.\"\n\n\"Kiffin,\" said the Doctor, \"are you crying?\"\n\n\"N--no, sir,\" faltered Kiffin; \"I--I think I must have caught cold,\nsir.\"\n\n\"I hope you are telling me the truth, because I should be sorry to\nbelieve you were beginning your new life in a spirit of captiousness and\nrebellion. I'll have no mutineers in my camp. I'll establish a spirit of\ntrustful happiness and unmurmuring content in this school, if I have to\nflog every boy in it as long as I can stand over him! As for you,\nRichard Bultitude, I have no words to express my pain and disgust at the\nheartless irreverence with which you persist in mimicking and\nburlesquing a fond and excellent parent. Unless I perceive, sir, in a\nvery short time a due sense of your error and a lively repentance, my\ndisapproval will take a very practical form.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude fell back into his seat with a gasp. It was hard to be\naccused of caricaturing one's own self, particularly when conscious of\nentire innocence in that respect, but even this was slight in comparison\nwith the discovery that he had been so blindly deceiving himself!\n\nThe Doctor evidently had failed to penetrate his disguise, and the\ndreaded scene of elaborate explanation must be gone through after all.\n\nThe boys (with the exception of Kiffin) still found exquisite enjoyment\nin this extraordinary and original exhibition, and waited eagerly for\nfurther experiment on the Doctor's patience.\n\nThey were soon gratified. If there was one thing Paul detested more than\nanother, it was the smell of peppermint--no less than three office boys\nhad been discharged by him because, as he alleged, they made the clerks'\nroom reek with it,--and now the subtle searching odour of the hated\nconfection was gradually stealing into the compartment and influencing\nits atmosphere.\n\nHe looked at Coggs, who sat on the seat opposite to him, and saw his\ncheeks and lips moving in slow and appreciative absorption of something.\nCoggs was clearly the culprit.\n\n\"Do you encourage your boys to make common nuisances of themselves in a\npublic place, may I ask, Dr. Grimstone?\" he inquired, fuming.\n\n\"Some scarcely seem to require encouragement, Bultitude,\" said the\nDoctor pointedly: \"what is the matter now?\"\n\n\"If he takes it medicinally,\" said Paul, \"he should choose some other\ntime and place to treat his complaint. If he has a depraved liking for\nthe abominable stuff, for Heaven's sake make him refrain from it on\noccasions when it is a serious annoyance to others!\"\n\n\"Will you explain? Who and what are you talking about?\"\n\n\"That boy opposite,\" said Paul, pointing the finger of denunciation at\nthe astonished Coggs; \"he's sucking an infernal peppermint lozenge\nstrong enough to throw the train off the rails!\"\n\n\"Is what Bultitude tells me true, Coggs?\" demanded the Doctor in an\nawful voice.\n\nCoggs, after making several attempts to bolt the offending lozenge, and\nturning scarlet meanwhile with confusion and coughing, stammered huskily\nsomething to the effect that he had \"bought the lozenges at a\nchemist's,\" which he seemed to consider, for some reason, a mitigating\ncircumstance.\n\n\"Have you any more of this pernicious stuff about you?\" said the Doctor.\n\nVery slowly and reluctantly Coggs brought out of one pocket after\nanother three or four neat little white packets, make up with that\nlavish expenditure of time, string, and sealing-wax, by which the\nstruggling chemist seeks to reconcile the public mind to a charge of two\nhundred and fifty per cent. on cost price, and handed them to Dr.\nGrimstone, who solemnly unfastened them one by one, glanced at their\ncontents with infinite disgust, and flung them out of window.\n\nThen he turned to Paul with a look of more favour than he had yet shown\nhim. \"Bultitude,\" he said, \"I am obliged to you. A severe cold in the\nhead has rendered me incapable of detecting this insidious act of\ninsubordination and self-indulgence, on which I shall have more to say\non another occasion. Your moral courage and promptness in denouncing the\nevil thing are much to your credit.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Paul, \"not at all, my dear sir. I mentioned it\nbecause I--ah--happen to be peculiarly sensitive on the subject and----\"\nHere he broke off with a sharp yell, and began to rub his ankle. \"One of\nthese young savages has just given me a severe kick; it's that fellow\nover there, with the blue necktie. I have given him no provocation, and\nhe attacks me in this brutal manner, sir; I appeal to you for\nprotection!\"\n\n\"So, Coker\" (Coker wore a blue necktie), said the Doctor, \"you emulate\nthe wild ass in more qualities than those of stupidity and stubbornness,\ndo you? You lash out with your hind legs at an inoffensive\nschool-fellow, with all the viciousness of a kangaroo, eh? Write out all\nyou find in Buffon's Natural History upon those two animals a dozen\ntimes, and bring it to me by to-morrow evening. If I am to stable wild\nasses, sir, they shall be broken in!\"\n\nSix pairs of sulky glowering eyes were fixed upon the unconscious Paul\nfor the rest of the journey; indignant protests and dark vows of\nvengeance were muttered under cover of the friendly roar and rattle of\ntunnels. But the object of them heard nothing; his composure was\nreturning once more in the sunshine of Dr. Grimstone's approbation, and\nhe almost decided on declaring himself in the station fly.\n\nAnd now at last the train was grinding along discordantly with the\nbrakes on, and, after a little preliminary jolting and banging over the\npoints, drew up at a long lighted platform, where melancholy porters\npaced up and down, croaking \"Market Rodwell!\" like so many Solomon\nEagles predicting woe.\n\nPaul got out with the others, and walked forward to the guard's van,\nwhere he stood shivering in the raw night air by a small heap of\nportmanteaux and white clamped boxes.\n\n\"I should like to tell him all about it now,\" he thought, \"if he wasn't\nso busy. I'll get him to go in a cab alone with me, and get it over\nbefore we reach the house.\"\n\nDr. Grimstone certainly did not seem in a very receptive mood for\nconfidences just then. No flys were to be seen, which he took as a\npersonal outrage, and visited upon the station-master in hot\nindignation.\n\n\"It's scandalous, I tell you,\" he was saying: \"scandalous! No cabs to\nmeet the train. My school reassembles to-day, and here I find no\narrangements made for their accommodation! Not even an omnibus! I shall\nwrite to the manager and report this. Let some one go for a fly\nimmediately. Boys, go into the waiting room till I come to you.\nStay--there are too many for one fly. Coker, Coggs, and, let me see,\nyes, Bultitude, you all know your way. Walk on and tell Mrs. Grimstone\nwe are coming.\"\n\nPaul Bultitude was perhaps more relieved than disappointed by this\npostponement of a disagreeable interview, though, if he had seen Coker\ndig Coggs in the side with a chuckle of exultant triumph, he might have\nhad misgivings as to the prudence of trusting himself alone with them.\n\nAs it was he almost determined to trust the pair with his secret. \"They\nwill be valuable witnesses,\" he said to himself, \"that, whoever else I\nmay be, I am not Dick.\"\n\nSo he went on briskly ahead over a covered bridge and down some\nbreak-neck wooden steps, and passed through the wicket out upon the\nrailed-in space, where the cabs and omnibuses should have been, but\nwhich was now a blank spectral waste with a white ground-fog lurking\nround its borders.\n\nHere he was joined by his companions, who, after a little whispering,\ncame up one on either side and put an arm through each of his.\n\n\"Well,\" said Paul, thinking to banter them agreeably; \"here you are,\nyoung men, eh? Holidays all over now! Work while you're young, and\nthen---- Gad, you're walking me off my legs. Stop; I'm not as young as I\nused to be----\"\n\n\"Grim can't see us here, can he, Coker?\" said Coggs when they had\ncleared the gates and palings.\n\n\"Not he!\" said Coker.\n\n\"Very well, then. Now then, young Bultitude, you used to be a decent\nfellow enough last term, though you _were_ coxy. So, before we go any\nfurther--what do you mean by this sort of thing?\"\n\n\"Because,\" put in Coker, \"if you aren't quite right in your head,\nthrough your old governor acting like a brute all the holidays, as you\nsaid he does, just say so, and we won't be hard on you.\"\n\n\"I--he--always an excellent father,\" stammered Paul. \"What am I to\nexplain?\"\n\n\"Why, what did you go and sneak of _him_ for bringing tuck back to\nschool for, eh?\" demanded Coker.\n\n\"Yes, and sing out when he hacked your shin?\" added Coggs; \"and tell\nGrimstone that new fellow was blubbing? Where's the joke in all that,\neh? Where's the joke?\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I was bound to sit calmly down and allow you to suck\nyour villainous peppermints under my very nose, do you?\" said Mr.\nBultitude. \"Why shouldn't I complain if a boy annoys me by sniffing, or\nkicks me on the ankle? Just tell me that? Suppose my neighbour has a\nnoisy dog or a smoky chimney, am I not to venture to tell him of it? Is\nhe to----\"\n\nBut his arguments, convincing as they promised to be, were brought to a\nsudden and premature close by Coker, who slipped behind him and\nadministered a sharp jog below his back, which jarred his spine and\ncaused him infinite agony.\n\n\"You little brute!\" cried Paul, \"I could have you up for assault for\nthat!\"\n\nBut upon this Coggs did the very same thing only harder. \"Last term\nyou'd have shown fight for much less, Bultitude,\" they both observed\nseverely, as some justification for repeating the process.\n\n\"Now, perhaps, you'll drop it for the future,\" said Coker. \"Look here!\nwe'll give you one more chance. This sneaking dodge is all very well for\nChawner. Chawner could do that sort of thing without getting sat upon,\nbecause he's a big fellow; but we're not going to stand it from you.\nWill you promise on your sacred word of honour, now, to be a decent sort\nof chap again, as you were last term?\"\n\nBut Mr. Bultitude, though he longed for peace and quietness, dreaded\ndoing or saying anything to favour the impression that he was the\nschoolboy he unluckily appeared to be, and he had not skill and tact\nenough to dissemble and assume a familiar genial tone of equality with\nthese rough boys.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" he protested feebly. \"If I could only tell\nyou----\"\n\n\"We don't want any fine language, you know,\" said the relentless Coggs.\n\"Yes or no. Will you promise to be your old self again?\"\n\n\"I only wish I could,\" said poor Mr. Bultitude--\"but I can't!\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Coggs firmly, \"we must try the torture. Coker,\nwill you screw the back of his hand, while I show him how they make\nbarley-sugar?\"\n\nAnd he gave Paul an interesting illustration of the latter branch of\nindustry by twisting his right arm round and round till he nearly\nwrenched it out of the socket, while Coker seized his left hand and\npounded it vigorously with the first joint of his forefinger, causing\nthe unfortunate Paul to yell for mercy.\n\nAt last he could bear no more, and breaking away from his tormentors\nwith a violent effort, he ran frantically down the silent road towards a\nhouse which he knew from former visits to be Dr. Grimstone's.\n\nHe was but languidly pursued, and, as the distance was short, he soon\ngained a gate on the stuccoed posts of which he could read \"Crichton\nHouse\" by the light of a neighbouring gas-lamp.\n\n\"This is a nice way,\" he thought, as he reached it breathless and\ntrembling, \"for a father to visit his son's school!\"\n\nHe had hoped to reach sanctuary before the other two could overtake him;\nbut he soon discovered that the gate was shut fast, and all his efforts\nwould not bring him within reach of the bell-handle--he was too short.\n\nSo he sat down on the doorstep in resigned despair, and waited for his\nenemies. Behind the gate was a large many-windowed house, with steps\nleading up to a portico. In the playground to his right the school\ngymnasium, a great gallows-like erection, loomed black and grim through\nthe mist, the night wind favouring the ghastliness of its appearance by\nswaying the ropes till they creaked and moaned weirdly on the hooks, and\nthe metal stirrups clinked and clashed against one another in irregular\ncadence.\n\nHe had no time to observe more, as Coker and Coggs joined him, and, on\nfinding he had not rung the bell, seized the occasion to pummel him at\ntheir leisure before announcing their arrival.\n\nThen the gate was opened, and the three--the revengeful pair assuming an\nair of lamb-like inoffensiveness--entered the hall and were met by Mrs.\nGrimstone.\n\n\"Why, here you are!\" she said, with an air of surprise, and kissing them\nwith real kindness. \"How cold you look! So you actually had to walk. No\ncabs as usual. You poor boys! come in and warm yourselves. You'll find\nall your old friends in the schoolroom.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude submitted to be kissed with some reluctance, inwardly\nhoping that Dr. Grimstone might never hear of it.\n\nMrs. Grimstone, it may be said here, was a stout, fair woman, not in the\nleast intellectual or imposing, but with a warm heart, and a way of\ntalking to and about boys that secured her the confidence of mothers\nmore effectually, perhaps, than the most polished conversation and\nirreproachable deportment could have done.\n\nShe did not reserve her motherliness for the reception room either, as\nsome schoolmasters' wives have a tendency to do, and the smallest boy\nfelt less homesick when he saw her.\n\nShe opened a green baize outer door, and the door beyond it, and led\nthem into a long high room, with desks and forms placed against the\nwalls, and a writing table, and line of brown-stained tables down the\nmiddle. Opposite the windows there was a curious structure of shelves\npartitioned into lockers, and filled with rows of shabby schoolbooks.\n\nThe room had been originally intended for a drawing-room, as was evident\nfrom the inevitable white and gold wall-paper and the tarnished gilt\nbeading round the doors and window shutters; the mantelpiece, too, was\nof white marble, and the gaselier fitted with dingy crystal lustres.\n\nBut sad-coloured maps hung on the ink-splashed walls, and a clock with a\nblank idiotic face (it is not every clock that possesses a decently\nintelligent expression) ticked over the gilt pier-glass. The boards were\nuncarpeted, and stained with patches of ink of all sizes and ages; while\nthe atmosphere, in spite of the blazing fire, had a scholastic blending\nof soap and water, ink and slate-pencil in its composition, which\nproduced a chill and depressing effect.\n\nOn the forms opposite the fire some ten or twelve boys were sitting, a\nfew comparing notes as to their holiday experiences with some approach\nto vivacity. The rest, with hands in pockets and feet stretched towards\nthe blaze, seemed lost in melancholy abstraction.\n\n\"There!\" said Mrs. Grimstone cheerfully, \"you'll have plenty to talk to\none another about. I'll send Tom in to see you presently!\" And she left\nthem with a reassuring nod, though the prospect of Tom's company did not\nperhaps elate them as much as it was intended to do.\n\nMr. Bultitude felt much as if he had suddenly been dropped down a\nbear-pit, and, avoiding welcome and observation as well as he could, got\naway into a corner, from which he observed his new companions with\nuneasy apprehension.\n\n\"I say,\" said one boy, resuming the interrupted conversation, \"did you\ngo to Drury Lane? Wasn't it stunning! That goose, you know, and the lion\nin the forest, and all the wooden animals lumbering in out of the toy\nNoah's Ark!\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you come to our party on Twelfth-night?\" asked another.\n\"We had great larks. I wish you'd been there!\"\n\n\"I had to go to young Skidmore's instead,\" said a pale, spiteful-looking\nboy, with fair hair carefully parted in the middle. \"It was like his\ncheek to ask me, but I thought I'd go, you know, just to see what it was\nlike.\"\n\n\"What was it like?\" asked one or two near him languidly.\n\n\"Oh, awfully slow! They've a poky little house in Brompton somewhere,\nand there was no dancing, only boshy games and a conjurer, without any\npresents. And, oh! I say, at supper there was a big cake on the table,\nand no one was allowed to cut it, because it was hired. They're so poor,\nyou know. Skidmore's pater is only a clerk, and you should see his\nsisters!\"\n\n\"Why, are they pretty?\"\n\n\"Pretty! they're just like young Skidmore--only uglier; and just fancy,\nhis mother asked me 'if I was Skidmore's favourite companion, and if he\nhelped me in my studies?'\"\n\nThe unfortunate Skidmore, when he returned, soon found reason to regret\nhis rash hospitality, for he never heard the last of the cake (which\nhad, as it happened, been paid for in the usual manner) during the rest\nof the term.\n\nThere was a slight laugh at the enormity of Mrs. Skidmore's presumption,\nand then a long pause, after which some one asked suddenly, \"Does any\none know whether Chawner really has left this time?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said a big, heavy boy, and his hope seemed echoed with a\ngeneral fervour. \"He's been going to leave every term for the last year,\nbut I believe he really has done it this time. He wrote and told me he\nwasn't coming back.\"\n\n\"Thank goodness!\" said several, with an evident relief, and some one was\njust observing that they had had enough of the sneaking business, when a\nfly was heard to drive up, and the bell rang, whereupon everyone\nabandoned his easy attitude, and seemed to brace himself up for a trying\nencounter.\n\n\"Look out--here's Grimstone!\" they whispered under their breaths, as\nvoices and footsteps were heard in the hall outside.\n\nPresently the door of the schoolroom opened, and another boy entered the\nroom. Dr. Grimstone, it appeared, had not been the occupant of the fly,\nafter all. The new-comer was a tall, narrow-shouldered, stooping fellow,\nwith a sallow, unwholesome complexion, thin lips, and small sunken\nbrown eyes. His cheeks were creased with a dimpling subsmile, half\nuneasy, half malicious, and his tread was mincing and catlike.\n\n\"Well, you fellows?\" he said.\n\nAll rose at once, and shook hands effusively. \"Why, Chawner!\" they\ncried, \"how are you, old fellow? We thought you weren't coming back!\"\n\nThere was a heartiness in their manner somewhat at variance with their\nrecent expressions of opinion; but they had doubtless excellent reasons\nfor any inconsistency.\n\n\"Well,\" said Chawner, in a low, soft voice, which had a suggestion of\nfeminine spitefulness, \"I was going to leave, but I thought you'd be\ngetting into mischief here without me to watch over you. Appleton, and\nLench, and Coker want looking after badly, I know. So, you see, I've\ncome back after all.\"\n\nHe laughed with a little malevolent cackle as he spoke, and the three\nboys named laughed too, though with no great heartiness, and shifting\nthe while uneasily on their seats.\n\nAfter this sally the conversation languished until Tom Grimstone's\nappearance. He strolled in with a semi-professional air, and shook hands\nwith affability.\n\nTom was a short, flabby, sandy-haired youth, not particularly beloved of\nhis comrades, and his first remark was, \"I say, you chaps, have you done\nyour holiday task? Pa says he shall keep everyone in who hasn't. I've\ndone mine;\" which, as a contribution to the general liveliness, was a\ndistinct failure.\n\nNeedless to say, the work imposed as a holiday occupation had been first\ndeferred, then forgotten, then remembered too late, and recklessly\ndefied with the confidence begotten in a home atmosphere.\n\nAmidst a general silence Chawner happened to see Mr. Bultitude in his\ncorner, and crossed over to him. \"Why, there's Dicky Bultitude there all\nthe time, and he never came to shake hands! Aren't you going to speak to\nme?\"\n\nPaul growled something indistinctly, feeling strangely uncomfortable\nand confused.\n\n\"What's the matter with him?\" asked Chawner. \"Does anyone know? Has he\nlost his tongue?\"\n\n\"He hadn't lost it coming down in the train,\" said Coker: \"I wish he\nhad. I tell you what, you fellows--He--here's Grim at last! I'll tell\nyou all about it up in the bedroom.\"\n\nAnd Dr. Grimstone really did arrive at this point, much to Paul's\nrelief, and looked in to give a grip of the hand and a few words to\nthose of the boys he had not seen.\n\nBiddlecomb, Tipping, and the rest, came in with him, and the schoolroom\nsoon filled with others arriving by later trains, amongst the later\ncomers being the two house-masters, Mr. Blinkhorn and Mr. Tinkler; and\nthere followed a season of bustle and conversation, which lasted until\nthe Doctor touched a small hand-bell, and ordered them to sit down round\nthe tables while supper was brought in.\n\nMr. Bultitude was not sorry to hear the word \"supper.\" He was faint and\ndispirited, and although he had dined not very long since, thought that\nperhaps a little cold beef and beer, or some warmed-up trifle, might\ngive him courage to tell his misfortunes before bedtime.\n\nOf one thing he felt certain. Nothing should induce him to trust his\nperson in a bedroom with any of those violent and vindictive boys;\nwhether he succeeded in declaring himself that night or not, he would at\nleast insist on a separate bedroom. Meantime he looked forward to supper\nas likely to restore geniality and confidence.\n\nBut the supper announced so imposingly proved to consist of nothing more\nthan two plates piled with small pieces of thinly-buttered bread, which\na page handed round together with tumblers of water; and Paul, in his\ndisappointment, refused this refreshment with more firmness than\npoliteness, as Dr. Grimstone observed.\n\n\"You got into trouble last term, Bultitude,\" he said sternly, \"on\naccount of this same fastidious daintiness. Your excellent father has\ninformed me of your waste and gluttony at his own bountifully spread\ntable. Don't let me have occasion to reprove you for this again.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude, feeling the necessity of propitiating him, hastened to\ntake the two largest squares of bread and butter on the plate. They were\nmoist and thick, and he had considerable difficulty in disposing of\nthem, besides the gratification of hearing himself described as a \"pig\"\nby his neighbours, who reproved him with a refreshing candour.\n\n\"I must get away from here,\" he thought, ruefully. \"Dick seems very\nunpopular. I wish I didn't feel so low-spirited and unwell. Why can't I\ncarry it off easily as--as a kind of joke? How hard these forms are, and\nhow those infernal boys did jog my back!\"\n\nBedtime came at length. The boys filed, one by one, out of the room, and\nthe Doctor stood by the door to shake hands with them as they passed.\n\nMr. Bultitude lingered until the others had gone, for he had made up his\nmind to seize this opportunity to open the Doctor's eyes to the mistake\nhe was making. But he felt unaccountably nervous; the diplomatic and\nwell-chosen introduction he had carefully prepared had left him at the\ncritical moment; all power of thought was gone with it, and he went\ntremblingly up to the schoolmaster, feeling hopelessly at the mercy of\nanything that chose to come out of his mouth.\n\n\"Dr. Grimstone,\" he began; \"before retiring I--I must insist--I mean I\nmust request---- What I wish to say is----\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the Doctor, catching him up sharply. \"You wish to\napologise for your extraordinary behaviour in the railway carriage?\nWell, though you made some amends afterwards, an apology is very right\nand proper. Say no more about it.\"\n\n\"It's not that,\" said Paul hopelessly; \"I wanted to explain----\"\n\n\"Your conduct with regard to the bread and butter? If it was simply\nwant of appetite, of course there is no more to be said. But I have an\nabhorrence of----\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Paul, recovering himself; \"I hate waste myself, but\nthere is something I must tell you before----\"\n\n\"If it concerns that disgraceful conduct of Coker's,\" said the Doctor,\n\"you may speak on. I shall have to consider his case to-morrow. Has any\nsimilar case of disobedience come to your knowledge? If so, I expect you\nto disclose it to me. You have found some other boy with sweetmeats in\nhis possession?\"\n\n\"Good Heavens, sir!\" said Mr. Bultitude, losing his temper; \"I haven't\nbeen searching the whole school for sweetmeats! I have other things to\noccupy my mind, sir. And, once for all, I demand to be heard! Dr.\nGrimstone, there are, ahem, domestic secrets that can only be alluded to\nin the strictest privacy. I see that one of your assistants is writing\nat his table there. Cannot we go where there will be less risk of\ninterruption? You have a study, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the Doctor with terrible grimness, \"I have a study--and\nI have a cane. I can convince you of both facts, if you wish it. If you\ninsult me again by this brazen buffoonery, I will! Be off to your\ndormitory, sir, before you provoke me to punish you. Not another word!\nGo!\"\n\nAnd, incredible as it may appear to all who have never been in his\nposition, Mr. Bultitude went. It was almost an abdication, it was\ntreachery to his true self; he knew the vital importance of firmness at\nthis crisis. But nevertheless his courage gave way all at once, and he\ncrawled up the bare, uncarpeted stairs without any further protest!\n\n\"Good night, Master Bultitude,\" said a housemaid, meeting him on the\nstaircase: \"you know your bedroom. No. 6, with Master Coker, and Master\nBiddlecomb, and the others.\"\n\nPaul dragged himself up to the highest landing-stage, and, with a sick\nforeboding, opened the door on which the figure 6 was painted.\n\nIt was a large bare plainly papered room, with several curtainless\nwindows, the blinds of which were drawn, a long deal stand of wash-hand\nbasins, and eight little white beds against the walls.\n\nA fire was lighted in consideration of its being the first night, and\nseveral boys were talking excitedly round it. \"Here he is! He's stayed\nbehind to tell more tales!\" they cried, as Paul entered nervously. \"Now\nthen, Bultitude, what have you got to say for yourself?\"\n\nMr. Bultitude felt powerless among all these young wolves. He had no\nknowledge of boys, nor any notion of acquiring an influence over them,\nhaving hitherto regarded them as necessary nuisances, to be rather\nrepressed than studied. He could only stare hopelessly at them in\nfascinated silence.\n\n\"You see he hasn't a word to say for himself!\" said Tipping. \"Look here,\nwhat shall we do to him? Shall we try tossing in a blanket? I've never\ntried tossing a fellow in one myself, but as long as you don't jerk him\ntoo high, or out on the floor, you can't hurt him dangerously.\"\n\n\"No, I say, don't toss him in a blanket,\" pleaded Biddlecomb, and Paul\nfelt gratefully towards him at the words; \"anyone coming up would see\nwhat was going on. I vote we flick at him with towels.\"\n\n\"Now just you understand this clearly,\" said Paul, thinking, not without\nreason, that this course of treatment was likely to prove painful; \"I\nrefuse to allow myself to be flicked at with towels. No one has ever\noffered me such an indignity in my life! Oh, do you think I've not\nenough on my mind as it is without the barbarities of a set of young\nbrutes like you!\"\n\nAs this appeal was not of a very conciliatory nature they at once\nproceeded to form a circle round him and, judging their distance with\ngreat accuracy, jerked towels at his person with such diabolical\ndexterity that the wet corners cut him at all points like so many fine\nthongs, and he span round like a top, dancing, and, I regret to add,\nswearing violently, at the pain.\n\nWhen he was worked up almost to frenzy pitch Biddlecomb's sweet low\nvoice cried, \"_Cave_, you fellows! I hear Grim. Let him undress now, and\nwe can lam it into him afterwards with slippers!\"\n\nAt this they all cast off such of their clothes as they still wore, and\nslipped modestly and peacefully into bed, just as Dr. Grimstone's large\nform appeared at the doorway. Mr. Bultitude made as much haste as he\ncould, but did not escape a reprimand from the Doctor as he turned the\ngas out; and as soon as he had made the round of the bedrooms and his\nheavy tread had died away down the staircase, the light-hearted\noccupants of No. 6 \"lammed\" it into the unhappy Paul until they were\ntired of the exercise and left him to creep sore and trembling with rage\nand fright into his cold hard bed.\n\nThen, after a little desultory conversation, one by one sank from\nincoherence into silence, and rose from silence to snores, while Paul\nalone lay sleepless, listening to the creeping tinkle of the dying fire,\ndrearily wondering at the marvellous change that had come over his life\nand fortunes in the last few hours, and feverishly composing impassioned\nappeals which were to touch the Doctor's heart and convince his reason.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. _Disgrace_\n\n     \"Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace\n     The day's disasters in his morning's face.\"\n\n\nSleep came at last, and brought too brief forgetfulness. It was not till\nthe dull grey light of morning was glimmering through the blinds that\nMr. Bultitude awoke to his troubles.\n\nThe room was bitterly cold, and he remained shivering in bed for some\ntime, trying to realise and prepare for his altered condition.\n\nHe was the only one awake. Now and then from one of the beds around a\nboy would be heard talking in his sleep, or laughing with holiday\nglee--at the drolleries possibly of some pantomime performed for his\namusement in the Theatre Royal, Dreamland--a theatre mercifully open to\nall boys free of charge, long after the holidays have come to an end,\nthe only drawbacks being a certain want of definiteness in the plot and\nscenery, and a liability to premature termination of the vaguely\nsplendid performance.\n\nOnce Kiffin, the new boy, awoke with a start and a heavy sigh, but he\ncried himself to sleep again almost immediately.\n\nMr. Bultitude could bear being inactive no longer. He thought, if he got\nup, he might perhaps see his misfortunes shrink to a more bearable, less\nhopeless scale, and besides, he judged it prudent, for many reasons, to\nfinish his toilet before the sleepers began theirs.\n\nVery stealthily, dreading to rouse anyone and attract attention in the\nform of slippers, he broke the clinking crust of ice in one of the\nbasins and, shuddering from the shock, bathed face and hands in the\nbiting water. He parted his hair, which from natural causes he had been\nunable to accomplish for some years, and now found an awkwardness in\naccomplishing neatly, and then stole down the dark creaking staircase\njust as the butler in the hall began to swing the big railway bell which\nwas to din stern reality into the sleepy ears above.\n\nIn the schoolroom a yawning maid had just lighted the fire, from which\nturbid yellow clouds of sulphurous smoke were pouring into the room,\nmaking it necessary to open the windows and lower a temperature that was\nfar from high originally.\n\nPaul stood shaking by the mantelpiece in a very bad temper for some\nminutes. If the Doctor had come in then, he might have been spurred by\nindignation to utter his woes, and even claim and obtain his freedom.\nBut that was not to be.\n\nThe door did open presently, however, and a little girl appeared; a very\ncharming little maiden indeed, in a neat dark costume relieved by a\nfresh white pinafore. She had deep grey eyes and glossy brown hair\nfalling over her forehead and down her back in soft straight masses, her\nface was oval rather than round, and slightly serious, though her smile\nwas pretty and gay.\n\nShe ran towards Mr. Bultitude with a glad little cry, stretching out her\nhands.\n\n\"Dick! dear Dick!\" she said, \"I am so glad! I thought you'd be down\nearly; as you used to be. I wanted to sit up last night so very much,\nbut mamma wouldn't let me.\"\n\nSome might have been very glad to be welcomed in this way, even\nvicariously. As for boys, it must have been a very bad school indeed\nwhich Dulcie Grimstone could not have robbed of much of its terrors.\n\nMr. Bultitude, however, as has been explained, did not appreciate\nchildren--being a family man himself. When one sees their petty\nsquabbles and jealousies, hears their cruel din, and pays for their\nmonkeyish mischief, perhaps the daintiest children seem but an earthly\norder of cherubim. He was only annoyed and embarrassed by the\ninterruption, though he endured it.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said with condescension, \"and so you're Dr. Grimstone's little\ngirl, are you? How d'ye do, my dear?\"\n\nDulcie stopped and looked at him, with drawn eyebrows and her soft mouth\nquivering. \"What makes you talk like that?\" she asked.\n\n\"How ought I to talk?\" said Paul.\n\n\"You didn't talk like that before,\" said Dulcie plaintively. \"I--I\nthought perhaps you'd be glad to see me. You were once. And--and--when\nyou went away last you asked me to--to--kiss you, and I did, and I wish\nI hadn't. And you gave me a ginger lozenge with your name written on it\nin lead pencil, and I gave you a cough-lozenge with mine; and you said\nit was to show that you were my sweetheart and I was yours. But I\nsuppose you've eaten the one I gave you?\"\n\n\"This is dreadful!\" thought Mr. Bultitude. \"What shall I do now? The\nchild evidently takes me for that little scoundrel Dick.\" \"Tut-tut,\" he\nsaid aloud, \"little girls like you are too young for such nonsense. You\nought to think about--about your dolls, and--ah, your needlework--not\nsweethearts!\"\n\n\"You say that now!\" cried Dulcie indignantly. \"You know I'm not a little\ngirl, and I've left off playing with dolls--almost. Oh, Dick, don't be\nunkind! You haven't changed your mind, have you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul dismally, \"I've changed my body. But there--you wouldn't\nunderstand. Run away and play somewhere, like a good little girl!\"\n\n\"I know what it is!\" said Dulcie. \"You've been out to parties, or\nsomewhere, and seen some horrid girl ... you like ... better than me!\"\n\n\"This is absurd, you know,\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"You can't think how\nabsurd it is! Now, you'll be a very foolish little girl if you cry.\nYou're making a mistake. I'm not the Dick you used to know!\"\n\n\"I know you're not!\" sobbed Dulcie. \"But oh, Dick, you will be. Promise\nme you will be!\" And, to Paul's horror and alarm, she put her arms round\nhis neck, and cried piteously on his shoulder.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" he cried, \"let me go. Don't do that, for Heaven's sake!\nI can hear some one coming. If it's your father, it will ruin me!\"\n\nBut it was too late. Over her head he saw Tipping enter the room, and\nstand glaring at them menacingly. Dulcie saw him too, and sprang away to\nthe window, where she tried to dry her eyes unperceived, and then ran\npast him with a hurried good morning, and escaped, leaving Paul alone\nwith the formidable Tipping.\n\nThere was an awkward silence at first, which Tipping broke by saying,\n\"What have you been saying to make her cry, eh?\"\n\n\"What's that to you, sir?\" said Paul, trying to keep his voice firm.\n\n\"Why, it's just this to me,\" said Tipping, \"that I've been spoons on\nDulcie myself ever since I came, and she never would have a word to say\nto me. I never could think why, and now it turns out to be you! What do\nyou mean by cutting me out like this? I heard her call you 'dear Dick.'\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass, sir!\" said Paul angrily.\n\n\"Now, none of your cheek, you know!\" said Tipping, edging up against him\nwith a dangerous inclination first to jostle aggressively, and then maul\nhis unconscious rival. \"You just mind what I say. I'm not going to have\nDulcie bothered by a young beggar in the second form; she deserves\nsomething better than that, anyway, and I tell you that if I once catch\nyou talking to her in the way you did just now, or if I hear of her\nfavouring you more than any other fellows, I'll give you the very\njuiciest licking you ever had in your life. So look out!\"\n\nAt this point the other boys began to straggle down and cluster round\nthe fire, and Paul withdrew from the aggrieved Tipping, and looked\ndrearily out of the window on the hard road and bare black trees\noutside.\n\n\"I _must_ tell the Doctor how I'm situated!\" he thought; \"and yet\ndirectly I open my mouth, he threatens to flog me. If I stay here, that\nlittle girl will be always trying to speak to me, and I shall be\nthrashed by the red-haired boy. If I could only manage to speak out\nafter breakfast!\"\n\nIt was not without satisfaction that he remembered that he paid extra\nfor \"meat for breakfast\" in his son's school-bills, for he was beginning\nto look forward to meal-time with the natural desire of a young and\nhealthy frame for nourishment.\n\nAt eight o'clock the Doctor came in and announced breakfast, leading\nthe way himself to what was known in the school as the \"Dining Hall.\" It\nscarcely deserved so high-sounding a name perhaps, being a long low room\non the basement floor, with a big fireplace, fitted with taps, and\nbaking ovens, which provoked the suspicion that it had begun existence\nas a back kitchen.\n\nThe Doctor took his seat alone at a cross table forming the top of one\nof the two rows of tables, set with white cups and saucers, and plates\nwell heaped with the square pieces of bread and butter, while Mrs.\nGrimstone with Dulcie and Tom, sat at the foot of the same row, behind\ntwo ugly urns of dull block-tin.\n\nBut when Mr. Bultitude, more hungry than he had felt for years, found\nhis place at one of the tables, he was disgusted to find upon his\nplate--not, as he had confidently expected, a couple of plump poached\neggs, with their appetising contrast of ruddy gold and silvery white,\nnot a crisp and crackling sausage or a mottled omelette, not even the\nhomely but luscious rasher, but a brace of chill forbidding sardines,\nlying grim and headless in bilious green oil!\n\nIt was a fish he positively loathed, nor could it be reasonably expected\nthat the confidence necessary for a declaration was to be forgotten by\nso sepulchral a form of nutriment.\n\nHe roused himself, however, to swallow them, together with some of the\nthin and tin-flavoured coffee. But the meal as a whole was so different\nfrom the plentiful well-cooked breakfasts he had sat down before for\nyears as a matter of course, that it made him feel extremely unwell.\n\nNo talking was allowed during the meal. The Doctor now and then looked\nup from his dish of kidneys on toast (at which envious glances were\noccasionally cast) to address a casual remark to his wife across the\nlong row of plates and cups, but, as a rule, the dull champing sound of\nboys solemnly and steadily munching was all that broke the silence.\n\nTowards the end, when the plates had been generally cleared, and the\nboys sat staring with the stolidity of repletion at one another across\nthe tables, the junior house-master, Mr. Tinkler, made his appearance.\nHe had lately left a small and little-known college at Cambridge, where\nhe had contrived, contrary to expectation, to evade the uncoveted wooden\nspoon by just two places, which enabled the Doctor to announce himself\nas being \"assisted by a graduate of the University of Cambridge who has\ntaken honours in the Mathematical Tripos.\"\n\nFor the rest, he was a small insignificant-looking person, who evidently\ndisliked the notice his late appearance drew upon himself.\n\n\"Mr. Tinkler,\" said the Doctor in his most awful voice, \"if it were my\ncustom to rebuke my assistants before the school (which it is not), I\nshould feel forced to remind you that this tardiness in rising is a bad\nbeginning of the day's work, and sets a bad example to those under your\nauthority.\"\n\nMr. Tinkler made no articulate reply, but sat down with a crushed\nexpression, and set himself to devour bread and butter with an energy\nwhich he hoped would divert attention from his blushes; and almost\nimmediately the Doctor looked at his watch and said, \"Now, boys, you\nhave half-an-hour for 'chevy'--make the most of it. When you come in I\nshall have something to say to you all. Don't rise, Mr. Tinkler, unless\nyou have quite finished.\"\n\nMr. Tinkler preferred leaving his breakfast to continuing it under the\ntrying ordeal of his principal's inspection. So, hastily murmuring that\nhe had \"made an excellent breakfast\"--which he had not--he followed the\nothers, who clattered upstairs to put on their boots and go out into the\nplayground.\n\nIt was noticeable that they did so without much of the enthusiasm which\nmight be looked for from boys dismissed to their sports. But the fact\nwas that this particular sport, \"chevy,\" commonly known as \"prisoners'\nbase,\" was by no means a popular amusement, being of a somewhat\nmonotonous nature, and calling for no special skill on the part of the\nperformers. Besides this, moreover, it had the additional disadvantage\n(which would have been fatal to a far more fascinating diversion) of\nbeing in a great measure compulsory.\n\nFootball and cricket were of course reserved for half-holidays, and\nplayed in a neighbouring field rented by the Doctor, and in the\nplayground he restricted them to \"chevy,\" which he considered, rightly\nenough, both gave them abundant exercise and kept them out of mischief.\nAccordingly, if any adventurous spirit started a rival game, it was\nusually abandoned sooner or later in deference to suggestions from\nheadquarters which were not intended to be disregarded.\n\nThis, though undoubtedly well meant, did not serve to stimulate their\naffection for the game, an excellent one in moderation, but one which,\nif played \"by special desire\" two or three hours a day for weeks in\nsuccession is apt to lose its freshness and pall upon the youthful mind.\n\nIt was a bright morning. There had been a hard frost during the night,\nand the ground was hard, sparkling with rime and ringing to the foot.\nThe air was keen and invigorating, and the bare black branches of the\ntrees were outlined clear and sharp against the pale pure blue of the\nmorning sky.\n\nJust the weather for a long day's skating over the dark green glassy\nice, or a bracing tramp on country roads into cheery red-roofed market\ntowns. But now it had lost all power to charm. It was almost depressing\nby the contrast between the boundless liberty suggested, and the dull\nreality of a round of uninteresting work which was all it heralded.\n\nSo they lounged listlessly about, gravitating finally towards the end of\nthe playground, where a deep furrow marked the line of the base. There\nwas no attempt to play. They stood gossiping in knots, grumbling and\nstamping their feet to keep warm. By-and-by the day-boarders began to\ndrop in one by one, several of them, from a want of tact in adapting\nthemselves to the general tone, earning decided unpopularity at once by\na cheerful briskness and an undisguised satisfaction at having something\ndefinite to do once more.\n\nIf Mr. Tinkler, who had joined one of the groups, had not particularly\ndistinguished himself at breakfast, he made ample amends now, and by the\ngrandeur and manliness of his conversation succeeded in producing a\ndecided impression upon some of the smaller boys.\n\n\"The bore of a place like this, you know,\" he was saying with\nmagnificent disdain, \"is that a fellow can't have his pipe of a morning.\nI've been used to it, and so, of course, I miss it. If I chose to insist\non it Grimstone couldn't say anything; but with a lot of young fellows\nlike you, you see, it wouldn't look well!\"\n\nIt could hardly have looked worse than little Mr. Tinkler himself would\nhave done, if he had ventured upon more than the mildest of cigarettes,\nfor he was a poor but pertinacious smoker, and his love for the weed was\nchastened by wholesome fear. There, however, he was in no danger of\nbetraying this, and indeed it would have been injudicious to admit it.\n\n\"Talking of smoking,\" he went on, with a soft chuckle, as at\nrecollections of unspeakable devilry, \"did I ever tell you chaps of a\ntremendous scrape I very nearly got into up at the 'Varsity? Well, you\nmust know there's a foolish rule there against smoking in the streets.\nNot that that made any difference to some of us! Well, one night about\nnine, I was strolling down Petty Cury with two other men, smoking\n(Bosher of \"Pothouse,\" and Peebles of \"Cats,\" both pretty well known up\nthere for general rowdiness, you know--great pals of mine!) and, just as\nwe turned the corner, who should we see coming straight down on us but a\nProctor with his bull-dogs (not dogs, you know, but the strongest 'gyps'\nin college). Bosher said, 'Let's cut it!' and he and Peebles bolted.\n(They were neither of them funks, of course, but they lost their heads.)\nI went calmly on, smoking my cigar as if nothing was the matter. That\nput the Proctor in a bait, I can tell you! He came fuming up to me.\n'What do you mean, sir,' says he, quite pale with anger (he was a great\nbull-headed fellow, one of the strongest dons of his year, that's why\nthey made him a Proctor)--'what do you mean by breaking the University\nStatutes in this way?' 'It _is_ a fine evening,' said I (I was\ndetermined to keep cool). 'Do you mean to insult me?' said he. 'No, old\nboy,' said I, 'I don't; have a cigar?' He couldn't stand that, so he\ncalled up his bull-dogs. 'I give him in charge!' he screamed out. 'I'll\nhave him sent down!' 'I'll send you down first,' said I, and I just gave\nhim a push--I never meant to hurt the fellow--and over he went. I rolled\nover a bull-dog to keep him company, and, as the other fellow didn't\nwant any more and stood aside to let me pass, I finished my stroll and\nmy cigar.\"\n\n\"Was the Proctor hurt, sir?\" inquired a small boy with great respect.\n\n\"More frightened than hurt, I always said,\" said Mr. Tinkler lightly,\n\"but somehow he never would proctorise any more--it spoilt his nerve. He\nwas a good deal chaffed about it, but of course no one ever knew I'd had\nanything to do with it!\"\n\nWith such tales of Homeric exploit did Mr. Tinkler inculcate a spirit of\ndiscipline and respect for authority. But although he had indeed once\nencountered a Proctor, and at night, he did himself great injustice by\nthis version of the proceedings, which were, as a matter of fact, of a\nmost peaceable and law-abiding character, and though followed by a\npecuniary transaction the next day in which six-and-eightpence changed\npockets, the Proctors continued their duties much as before, while Mr.\nTinkler's feelings towards them, which had ever been reverential in the\nextreme, were, if anything, intensified by the experience.\n\nUpon this incident, however, he had gradually embroidered the above\nexciting episode, until he grew to believe at intervals that he really\nhad been a devil of a fellow in his time, which, to do him justice, was\nfar from the case.\n\nHe might have gone on still further to calumniate himself, and excite\ngeneral envy and admiration thereby, if at that moment Dr. Grimstone had\nnot happened to appear at the head of the cast-iron staircase that led\ndown into the playground; whereupon Mr. Tinkler affected to be intensely\ninterested in the game, which, as a kind of involuntary compliment to\nthe principal, about this time was galvanised into a sort of vigour.\n\nBut the Doctor, after frowning gloomily down upon them for a minute or\nso, suddenly called \"All in!\"\n\nHe had several ways of saying this. Sometimes he would do so in a\nhalf-regretful tone, as one himself obeying the call of duty; sometimes\nhe would appear for some minutes, a benignant spectator, upon the\nbalcony, and summon them to work at length with a lenient pity--for he\nwas by no means a hard-hearted man; but at other times he would step\nsharply and suddenly out and shout the word of command with a grim and\nominous expression. On these last occasions the school generally\nprepared itself for a rather formidable quarter of an hour.\n\nThis was the case now and, as a further portent, Mr. Blinkhorn was\nobserved to come down and, after a few words with Mr. Tinkler, withdrew\nwith him through the school gate.\n\n\"He's sent them out for a walk,\" said Siggers, who was skilled in omens.\n\"It's a row!\"\n\nRows at Crichton House, although periodical, and therefore things to be\nforearmed against in some degree, were serious matters. Dr. Grimstone\nwas a quick-tempered man, with a copious flow of words and a taste for\nindulging it. He was also strongly prejudiced against many breaches of\ndiscipline which others might have considered trifling, and whenever he\nhad discovered any such breach he could not rest until by all the means\nin his power he had ascertained exactly how many were implicated in the\noffence, and to what extent.\n\nHis usual method of doing this was to summon the school formally\ntogether and deliver an elaborate harangue, during which he worked\nhimself by degrees into such a state of indignation that his hearers\nwere most of them terrified out of their senses, and very often\nconscience-stricken offenders would give themselves up as hopelessly\ndetected and reveal transgressions altogether unsuspected by him--much\nas a net brings up fish of all degrees of merit, or as heavy firing will\nraise drowned corpses to the surface.\n\nPaul naturally knew nothing of this peculiarity; he had kept himself as\nusual apart from the others, and was now trying to compel himself to\nbrave the terrors of an avowal at the first opportunity. He followed the\nothers up the steps with an uneasy wonder whether, after all, he would\nnot find himself ignominiously set down to learn lessons.\n\nThe boys filed into the schoolroom in solemn silence, and took their\nseats at the desks and along the brown tables. The Doctor was there\nbefore them, standing up with one elbow resting upon a reading-stand,\nand with a suggestion of coming thunder in his look and attitude that,\ncombined with the oppressive silence, made some of the boys feel\npositively ill.\n\nPresently he began. He said that, since they had come together again, he\nhad made a discovery concerning one among them which, astounding as it\nwas to him, and painful as he felt it to be compelled to make it known,\nconcerned them all to be aware of.\n\nMr. Bultitude could scarcely believe his ears. His secret was\ndiscovered, then; the injury done him by Dick about to be repaired, and\nopen restitution and apology offered him! It was not perhaps precisely\ndelicate on the Doctor's part to make so public an affair of it, but so\nlong as it ended well, he could afford to overlook that.\n\nSo he settled himself comfortably on a form with his back against a\ndesk and his legs crossed, his expression indicating plainly that he\nknew what was coming and, on the whole, approved of it.\n\n\"Ever since I have devoted myself to the cause of tuition,\" continued\nthe Doctor, \"I have made it my object to provide boys under my roof with\nfare so abundant and so palatable that they should have no excuse for\nobtaining extraneous luxuries. I have presided myself at their meals, I\nhave superintended their very sports with a fatherly eye----\"\n\nHere he paused, and fixed one or two of those nearest him with the\nfatherly eye in such a manner that they writhed with confusion.\n\n\"He's wandering from the point,\" thought Paul, a little puzzled.\n\n\"I have done all this on one understanding--that the robustness of your\nconstitutions, acquired by the plain, simple, but abundant regimen of my\ntable, shall not be tampered with by the indulgence in any of the\npampering products of confectionery. They are absolutely and\nunconditionally prohibited--as every boy who hears me now knows\nperfectly well!\n\n\"And yet\" (here he began gradually to relax his self-restraint and lash\nhimself into a frenzy of indignation), \"what do I find? There are some\nnatures so essentially base, so incapable of being affected by kindness,\nso dead to honour and generosity, that they will not scruple to conspire\nor set themselves individually to escape and baffle the wise precautions\nundertaken for their benefit. I will not name the dastards at\npresent--they themselves can look into their hearts and see their guilt\nreflected there----\"\n\nAt this every boy, beginning to see the tendency of his denunciations,\ntried hard to assume an air of conscious innocence and grieved interest,\nthe majority achieving conspicuous failure.\n\n\"I do not like to think,\" said Dr. Grimstone, \"that the evil has a\nwider existence than I yet know of. It may be so; nothing will surprise\nme now. There may be some before me trembling with the consciousness of\nsecret guilt. If so, let those boys make the only reparation in their\npower, and give themselves up in an honourable and straightforward\nmanner!\"\n\nTo this invitation, which indeed resembled that of the duck-destroying\nMrs. Bond, no one made any response. They had grown too wary, and now\npreferred to play a waiting game.\n\n\"Then let the being--for I will not call him boy--who is known to me,\nstep forth and confess his fault publicly, and sue for pardon!\"\nthundered the Doctor, now warmed to his theme.\n\nBut the being declined from a feeling of modesty, and a faint hope that\nsomebody else might, after all, be the person aimed at.\n\n\"Then I name him!\" stormed Dr. Grimstone; \"Cornelius Coggs--stand up!\"\n\nCoggs half rose in a limp manner, whimpering feebly, \"Me, sir? Oh,\nplease sir--no, not me, sir!\"\n\n\"Yes, you, sir, and let your companions regard you with the contempt and\nabhorrence you so richly merit!\" Here, needless to say, the whole school\nglared at poor Coggs with as much virtuous indignation as they could\nsummon up at such short notice; for contempt is very infectious when\ncommunicated from high quarters.\n\n\"So, Coggs,\" said the Doctor, with a slow and withering scorn, \"so you\nthought to defy me; to smuggle compressed illness and concentrated\nunhealthiness into this school with impunity? You flattered yourself\nthat after I had once confiscated your contraband poisons, you would\nhear no more of it! You deceived yourself, sir! I tell you, once for\nall, that I will not allow you to contaminate your innocent schoolmates\nwith your gifts of surreptitious sweetmeats; they shall not be perverted\nwith your pernicious peppermints, sir; you shall not deprave them by\njujubes, or enervate them with Turkish Delight! I will not expose\nmyself or them to the inroads of disease invited here by a hypocritical\ninmate of my walls. The traitor shall have his reward!\"\n\nAll of which simply meant that the Doctor, having once had a small boy\ntaken seriously ill from the effects of overeating himself, was\nnaturally anxious to avoid such an inconvenience for the future. \"Thanks\nto the fearless honesty of a youth,\" continued the Doctor, \"who, in an\neccentric manner, certainly, but with, I do not doubt, the best of\nmotives, opened my eyes to the fell evil, I am enabled to cope with it\nat its birth. Richard Bultitude, I take this occasion of publicly\nthanking and commending you; your conduct was noble!\"\n\nMr. Bultitude was too angry and disappointed to speak. He had thought\nhis path was going to be made smooth, and now all this ridiculous fuss\nwas being made about a few peppermint lozenges. He wished he had never\nmentioned them. It was not the last time he breathed that wish. \"As for\nyou, Coggs,\" said the Doctor, suddenly producing a lithe brown cane, \"I\nshall make a public example of you.\"\n\nCoggs stared idiotically and protested, but after a short and painful\nscene, was sent off up to his bedroom, yelping like a kicked puppy.\n\n\"One word more,\" said the Doctor, now almost calm again. \"I know that\nyou all think with me in your horror of the treachery I have just\nexposed. I know that you would scorn to participate in it.\" (A thrill\nand murmur, expressive of intense horror and scorn, went round the\nbenches.) \"You are anxious to prove that you do so beyond a doubt.\"\n(Again a murmur of assent.) \"I give you all that opportunity. I have\nimplicit trust and confidence in you--let every boarder go down into the\nbox-room and fetch up his playbox, just as it is, and open it here\nbefore me.\"\n\nThere was a general fall of jaws at this very unexpected conclusion; but\ncontriving to overcome their dismay, they went outside and down through\nthe playground into the box-room, Paul amongst the rest, and amidst\nuniversal confusion, everyone opened his box, and, with a consideration\nespecially laudable in heedless boyhood, thoughtfully and carefully\nremoved from it all such dainties as might be calculated to shock or\npain their preceptor.\n\nMr. Bultitude found a key which was labelled \"playbox,\" and began to\nopen a box which bore Dick's initials cut upon the lid; without any\napprehensions, however, for he had given too strict orders to his\ndaughter, to fear that any luxuries would be concealed there.\n\nBut no sooner had he raised the lid than he staggered back with disgust.\nIt was crammed with cakes, butterscotch, hardbake, pots of jam, and even\na bottle of ginger wine--enough to compromise a chameleon!\n\nHe set himself to pitch them all out as soon as possible with feverish\nhaste, but Tipping was too quick for him. \"Hallo!\" he cried: \"oh, I say,\nyou fellows, come here! Just look at this! Here's this impudent young\nbeggar, who sneaked of poor old Coggs for sucking jujubes, and very\nnearly got us all into a jolly good row, with his own box full all the\ntime; butterscotch, if you please, and jam, and ginger wine! You'll just\nput 'em all back again, will you, you young humbug!\"\n\n\"Do you use those words to me, sir?\" said Paul angrily, for he did not\nlike to be called a humbug.\n\n\"Yes, sir, please, sir,\" jeered Tipping; \"I did venture to take such a\nliberty, sir.\"\n\n\"Then it was like your infernal impudence,\" growled Paul. \"You be kind\nenough to leave my affairs alone. Upon my word, what boys are coming to\nnowadays!\"\n\n\"Are you going to put that tuck back?\" said Tipping impatiently.\n\n\"No, sir, I'm not. Don't interfere with what you're not expected to\nunderstand!\"\n\n\"Well, if you won't,\" said Tipping easily, \"I suppose we must.\nBiddlecomb, kindly knock him down, and sit on his head while I fill his\nplaybox for him.\"\n\nThis was neatly and quickly done. Biddlecomb tripped Mr. Bultitude up,\nand sat firmly on him, while Tipping carefully replaced the good things\nin Dick's box, after which he locked it, and courteously returned the\nkey. \"As the box is heavy,\" he said, with a wicked wink, \"I'll carry it\nup for you myself,\" which he did, Paul following, more dead than alive,\nand too shaken even to expostulate.\n\n\"Bultitude's box was rather too heavy for him, sir,\" he explained as he\ncame in; and Dr. Grimstone, who had quite recovered his equanimity,\nsmiled indulgently, and remarked that he \"liked to see the strong\nassisting the weak.\"\n\nAll the boxes had by this time been brought up, and were ranged upon the\ntables, while the Doctor went round, making an almost formal inspection,\nlike a Custom House officer searching compatriots, and becoming milder\nand milder as box after box opened to reveal a fair and innocent\ninterior.\n\nPaul's turn was coming very near, and his heart seemed to shrivel like a\nburst bladder. He fumbled with his key, and tried hard to lose it. It\nwas terrible to have oneself to apply the match which is to blow one to\nthe winds. If--if--the idea was almost too horrible--but if he, a\nblameless and respectable city merchant, were actually to find himself\nserved like the miserable Coggs!\n\nAt last the Doctor actually stood by him. \"Well, my boy,\" he said, not\nunkindly, \"I'm not afraid of anything wrong here, at any rate.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude, who had the best reasons for not sharing his confidence,\nmade some inarticulate sounds, and pretended to have a difficulty in\nturning the key.\n\n\"Eh? Come, open the box,\" said the Doctor with an altered manner. \"What\nare you fumbling at it for in this--this highly suspicious manner? I'll\nopen it myself.\"\n\nHe took the key and opened the lid, when the cakes and wine stood\nrevealed in all their damning profusion. The Doctor stepped back\ndramatically. \"Hardbake!\" he gasped; \"wine, pots of strawberry jam! Oh,\nBultitude, this is a revelation indeed! So I have nourished one more\nviper in my bosom, have I? A crawling reptile which curries favour by\ndenouncing the very crime it conceals in its playbox! Bultitude, I was\nnot prepared for such duplicity as this!\"\n\n\"I--I swear I never put them in!\" protested the unhappy Paul. \"I--I\nnever touch such things: they would bring on my gout in half-an-hour.\nIt's ridiculous to punish me. I never knew they were there!\"\n\n\"Then why were you so anxious to avoid opening the box?\" rejoined the\nDoctor. \"No, sir, you're too ingenious; your guilt is clear. Go to your\ndormitory, and wait there till I come to you!\"\n\nPaul went upstairs, feeling utterly abandoned and helpless. Though a\nword as to his real character might have saved him, he could not have\nsaid it, and, worse still, knew now that he could not.\n\n\"I shall be caned,\" he told himself, and the thought nearly drove him\nmad. \"I know I shall be caned! What on earth shall I do?\"\n\nHe opened the door of his bedroom. Coggs was rocking and moaning on his\nbed in one corner of the room, but looked up with red furious eyes as\nPaul came in.\n\n\"What do you want up here?\" he said savagely. \"Go away, can't you!\"\n\n\"I wish I _could_ go away,\" said Paul dolefully; \"but I'm--hum--I'm sent\nup here too,\" he explained, with some natural embarrassment.\n\n\"What!\" cried Coggs, slipping off his bed and staring wildly: \"you don't\nmean to say you're going to catch it too?\"\n\n\"I've--ah--every reason to fear,\" said Mr. Bultitude stiffly, \"that I am\nindeed going to 'catch it,' as you call it.\"\n\n\"Hooray!\" shouted Coggs hysterically: \"I don't care now. And I'll have\nsome revenge on my own account as well. I don't mind an extra licking,\nand you're in for one as it is. Will you stand up to me or not?\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Paul. \"Don't come so near. Keep off, you\nyoung demon, will you!\" he cried presently, as Coggs, exasperated by all\nhis wrongs, was rushing at him with an evidently hostile intent. \"There,\ndon't be annoyed, my good boy,\" he pleaded, catching up a chair as a\nbulwark. \"It was a misunderstanding. I wish you no harm. There, my dear\nyoung friend! Don't!\"\n\nThe \"dear young friend\" was grappling with him and attempting to wrest\nthe chair away by brute force. \"When I get at you,\" he said, his hot\nbreath hissing through the chair rungs, \"I'll jolly well teach you to\nsneak of me!\"\n\n\"Murder!\" Paul gasped, feeling his hold on the chair relaxing. \"Unless\nhelp comes this young fiend will have my blood!\"\n\nThey were revolving slowly round the chair, watching each other's eyes\nlike gladiators, when Paul noticed a sudden blankness and fixity in his\nantagonist's expression, and, looking round, saw Dr. Grimstone's awful\nform framed in the doorway, and gave himself up for lost.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. _Learning and Accomplishments_\n\n     \"I subscribe to Lucian: 'tis an elegant thing which cheareth up the\n     mind, exerciseth the body, delights the spectators, which teacheth\n     many comely gestures, equally affecting the ears, eyes and soul\n     itself.\"--BURTON, _on Dancing_.\n\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Dr. Grimstone in his most blood-curdling tone,\nafter a most impressive pause at the dormitory door.\n\nMr. Bultitude held his tongue, but kept fast hold of his chair, which he\nheld before him as a defence against either party, while Coggs remained\nmotionless in the centre of the room, with crooked knees and hands\ndangling impotently.\n\n\"Will one of you be good enough to explain how you come to be found\nstruggling in this unseemly manner? I sent you up here to meditate on\nyour past behaviour.\"\n\n\"I should be most happy to meditate, sir,\" protested Paul, lowering his\nchair on discovering that there was no immediate danger, \"if that--that\nbloodthirsty young ruffian there would allow me to do so. I am going\nabout in bodily fear of him, Dr. Grimstone. I want him bound over to\nkeep the peace. I decline to be left alone with him--he's not safe!\"\n\n\"Is that so, Coggs? Are you mean and base enough to take this cowardly\nrevenge on a boy who has had the moral courage to expose your\ndeceit--for your ultimate good--a boy who is unable to defend himself\nagainst you?\"\n\n\"He can fight when he chooses, sir,\" said Coggs; \"he blacked my eye last\nterm, sir!\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" said Paul, with the convincing earnestness of truth,\n\"that I never blacked anybody's eye in the whole course of my life. I am\nnot--ah--a pugnacious man. My age, and--hum--my position, ought to\nprotect me from these scandals----\"\n\n\"You've come back this year, sir,\" said Dr. Grimstone, \"with a very odd\nway of talking of yourself--an exceedingly odd way. Unless I see you\nabandoning it, and behaving like a reasonable boy again, I shall be\nforced to conclude you intend some disrespect and open defiance by it.\"\n\n\"If you would allow me an opportunity of explaining my position, sir,\"\nsaid Paul, \"I would undertake to clear your mind directly of such a\nmonstrous idea. I am trying to assert my rights, Dr. Grimstone--my\nrights as a citizen, as a householder! This is no place for me, and I\nappeal to you to set me free. If you only knew one tenth----\"\n\n\"Let us understand one another, Bultitude,\" interrupted the Doctor.\n\"You may think it an excellent joke to talk nonsense to me like this.\nBut let me tell you there is a point where a jest becomes an insult.\nI've spared you hitherto out of consideration for the feelings of your\nexcellent father, who is so anxious that you should become an object of\npride and credit to him; but if you dare to treat me to any more of this\nbombast about 'explaining your rights,' you will force me to exercise\none of mine--the right to inflict corporal punishment, sir--which you\nhave just seen in operation upon another.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Bultitude faintly, feeling utterly crestfallen--and he\ncould say nothing more.\n\n\"As for those illicit luxuries in your playbox,\" continued the Doctor,\n\"the fact that you brought the box up as it was is in your favour; and I\nam inclined on reflection to overlook the affair, if you can assure me\nthat you were no party to their being put there?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Paul, \"I gave the strictest orders that there\nwas to be no such useless extravagance. I objected to have the kitchen\nand housekeeper's room ransacked to make a set of rascally boys ill for\na fortnight at my expense!\"\n\nThe Doctor stared slightly at this creditable but unnatural view of the\nsubject. However, as he could not quarrel with the sentiment, he let the\nmanner of expressing it pass unrebuked for the present, and, after\nsentencing Coggs to two days' detention and the copying of innumerable\nFrench verbs, he sent the ill-matched pair down to the schoolroom to\njoin their respective classes.\n\nPaul went resignedly downstairs and into the room, where he found Mr.\nBlinkhorn at the head of one of the long tables, taking a class of about\na dozen boys.\n\n\"Take your Livy and Latin Primer, Bultitude,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn mildly,\n\"and sit down.\"\n\nMr. Blinkhorn was a tall angular man, with a long neck and slightly\ndrooping head. He had thin wiry brown hair, and a plain face, with\nshortsighted kind brown eyes. In character he was mild and reserved,\ntoo conscientious to allow himself the luxury of either favourites or\naversions among the boys, all of whom in his secret soul he probably\ndisliked about equally, though he neither said nor did anything to show\nit.\n\nPaul took a book--any book, for he did not know or care to know one from\nanother--and sat down at the end furthest from the master, inwardly\nrebelling at having education thus forced upon him at his advanced\nyears, but seeing no escape.\n\n\"At dinner time,\" he resolved desperately, \"I will insist on speaking\nout, but just now it is simply prudent to humour them.\"\n\nThe rest of the class drew away from him with marked coldness and\noccasionally saluted him (when Mr. Blinkhorn's attention was called\naway) with terms and grimaces which Paul, although he failed thoroughly\nto understand them, felt instinctively were not intended as compliments.\n\nMr. Blinkhorn's notions of discipline were qualified by a sportsmanlike\ninstinct which forbade him to harass a boy already in trouble, as he\nunderstood young Bultitude had been, and so he forbore from pressing him\nto take any share in the class work.\n\nMr. Bultitude therefore was saved from any necessity of betraying his\ntotal ignorance of his author, and sat gloomily on the hard form,\nimpatiently watching the minute-hand skulk round the mean dull face of\nthe clock above the chimney-piece, while around him one boy after\nanother droned out a listless translation of the work before him,\ninterrupted by mild corrections and comments from the master.\n\nWhat a preposterous change from all his ordinary habits! At this very\ntime, only twenty-four hours since, he was stepping slowly and\nmajestically towards his accustomed omnibus, which was waiting with\ndeference for him to overtake it; he was taking his seat, saluted\nrespectfully by the conductor and cheerily by his fellow-passengers, as\na man of recognised mark and position.\n\nNow that omnibus would halt at the corner of Westbourne Terrace in vain,\nand go on its way Bankwards without him. He was many miles away--in the\nvery last place where anyone would be likely to look for him, occupying\nthe post of \"whipping-boy\" to his miserable son!\n\nWas ever an inoffensive and respectable gentleman placed in a more false\nand ridiculous position?\n\nIf he had only kept his drawer locked, and hidden the abominable GarudÃ¢\nStone away from Dick's prying eyes; if he had let the moralising alone;\nif Boaler had not been so long fetching that cab, or if he had not\nhappened to faint at the critical moment--what an immense difference any\none of these apparent trifles would have made.\n\nAnd now what was he to do to get out of this incongruous and distasteful\nplace? It was all very well to say that he had only to insist upon a\nhearing from the Doctor, but what if, as he had very grave reason to\nfear, the Doctor should absolutely refuse to listen, should even proceed\nto carry out his horrible threat? Must he remain there till the holidays\ncame to release him? Suppose Dick--as he certainly would unless he was\nquite a fool--declined to receive him during the holidays? It was\nabsolutely necessary to return home at once; every additional hour he\npassed in imprisonment made it harder to regain his lost self.\n\nNow and then he roused himself from all these gloomy thoughts to observe\nhis companions. The boys at the upper end, near Mr. Blinkhorn, were\nfairly attentive, and he noticed one small smug-faced boy about half-way\nup, who, while a class-mate was faltering and blundering over some\nquestion, would cry \"I know, sir. Let me tell him. Ask me, sir!\" in a\nrestless agony of superior information.\n\nDown by Paul, however, the discipline was relaxed enough, as perhaps\ncould only be expected on the first day of term. One wild-eyed\nlong-haired boy had brought out a small china figure with which, and the\nassistance of his right hand draped in a pocket handkerchief, and\nwielding a penholder, he was busy enacting a drama based on the lines of\nPunch and Judy, to the breathless amusement of his neighbours.\n\nMr. Bultitude might have hoped to escape notice by a policy of judicious\nself-effacement, but unhappily his long, blank, uninterested face was\nheld by his companions to bear an implied reproach; and being delicately\nsensitive on this point, they kicked his legs viciously, which made him\nextremely glad when dinnertime came, although he felt too faint and\nbilious to be tempted by anything but the lightest and daintiest\nluncheon.\n\nBut at dinner he found, with a shudder, that he was expected to swallow\na thick ragged section of boiled mutton which had been carved and helped\nso long before he sat down to it, that the stagnant gravy was chilled\nand congealed into patches of greasy white. He managed to swallow it\nwith many pauses of invincible disgust--only to find it replaced by a\nsolid slab of pale brown suet pudding, sparsely bedewed with unctuous\nblack treacle.\n\nThis, though a plentiful, and by no means unwholesome fare for growing\nboys, was not what he had been accustomed to, and feeling far too heavy\nand unwell after it to venture upon an encounter with the Doctor, he\nwandered slow and melancholy round the bare gravelled playground during\nthe half-hour after dinner devoted to the inevitable \"chevy,\" until the\nDoctor appeared at the head of the staircase.\n\nIt is always sad for the historian to have to record a departure from\nprinciple, and I have to confess with shame on Mr. Bultitude's account\nthat, feeling the Doctor's eye upon him, and striving to propitiate him,\nhe humiliated himself so far as to run about with an elaborate affection\nof zest, and his exertions were rewarded by hearing himself cordially\nencouraged to further efforts.\n\nIt cheered and emboldened him. \"I've put him in a good temper,\" he told\nhimself; \"if I can only keep him in one till the evening, I really think\nI might be able to go up and tell him what a ridiculous mess I've got\ninto. Why should I care, after all? At least I've done nothing to be\nashamed of. It's an accident that might have happened to any man!\"\n\nIt is a curious and unpleasant thing that, however reassuring and\nconvincing the arguments may be with which we succeed in bracing\nourselves to meet or disregard unpleasantness, the force of those\narguments seldom or never outlasts the frame of mind in which they are\ncomposed, and when the unpleasantness is at hand, there we are, just as\nunreasonably alarmed at it as ever.\n\nMr. Bultitude's confidence faded away almost as soon as he found himself\nin the schoolroom again. He found himself assigned to a class at one end\nof the room, where Mr. Tinkler presently introduced a new rule in\nAlgebra to them, in such a manner as to procure for it a lasting\nunpopularity with all those who were not too much engaged in drawing\nduels and railway trains upon their slates to attend.\n\nAlthough Paul did not draw upon his slate, his utter ignorance of\nAlgebra prevented him from being much edified by the cabalistic signs on\nthe blackboard, which Mr. Tinkler seemed to chalk up dubiously, and rub\nout again as soon as possible, with an air of being ashamed of them. So\nhe tried to nerve himself for the coming ordeal by furtively watching\nand studying the Doctor, who was taking a Xenophon class at the upper\nend of the room, and, being in fairly good humour, was combining\ninstruction with amusement in a manner peculiarly his own.\n\nHe stopped the construing occasionally to illustrate some word or\npassage by an anecdote; he condescended to enliven the translation here\nand there by a familiar and colloquial paraphrase; he magnanimously\nrefrained from pressing any obviously inconvenient questions; and his\nmanner generally was marked by a geniality which was additionally\npiquant from its extreme uncertainty.\n\nMr. Bultitude could not help thinking it a rather ghastly form of\ngaiety, but he hoped it might last.\n\nPresently, however, some one brought him a blue envelope on a tray. He\nread it, and a frown gathered on his face. The boy who was translating\nat the time went on again in his former slipshod manner (which had\nhitherto provoked only jovial criticism and correction) with complete\nself-complacency, but found himself sternly brought to book, and\nburdened by a heavy imposition, before he quite realised that his\nblunders had ceased to amuse.\n\nThen began a season of sore trial and tribulation for the class. The\nDoctor suddenly withdrew the light of his countenance from them, and\nsunshine was succeeded by blackest thunderclouds. The wind was no longer\ntempered to the more closely shorn of the flock; the weakest vessels\nwere put on unexpectedly at crucial passages, and, coming hopelessly to\ngrief, were denounced as impostors and idlers, till half the class was\ndissolved in tears.\n\nA few of the better grounded stood the fire, like a remnant of the Old\nGuard. With faces pale from alarm, and trembling voices, but perfect\naccuracy, they answered all the Doctor's searching inquiries after the\nparadigms of Greek verbs that seemed irregular to the verge of\nimpropriety.\n\nPaul saw it all with renewed misgiving. \"If I were there,\" he thought,\n\"I should have been run out and flogged long ago! How angry those stupid\nyoung idiots are making him! How can I go up and speak to him when he's\nlike that? And yet I must. I'm sitting on dynamite as it is. The very\nfirst time they want me to answer any questions from some of their\nbooks, I shall be ruined! Why wasn't I better educated when I was a\nboy, or why didn't I make a better use of my opportunities! It will be a\nbitter thing if they thrash me for not knowing as much as Dick.\nGrimstone's coming this way now; it's all over with me!\"\n\nThe Greek class had managed to repel the enemy, with some loss to\nthemselves, and the Doctor now left his place for a moment, and came\ndown towards the bench on which Paul sat trembling.\n\nThe storm, however, had passed over for the present, and he only said\nwith restored calmness, \"Who were the boys who learnt dancing last\nterm?\"\n\nOne or two of them said they had done so, and Dr. Grimstone continued:\n\"Mr. Burdekin was unable to give you the last lesson of his course last\nterm, and has arranged to take you to-day, as he will be in the\nneighbourhood. So be off at once to Mrs. Grimstone and change your\nshoes. Bultitude, you learnt last term, too. Go with the others.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude was too overcome by this unexpected attack to contradict\nit, though of course he was quite able to do so; but then, if he had, he\nmust have explained all, and he felt strongly that just then was neither\nthe time nor the place for particulars.\n\nIt would have been wiser perhaps, it would certainly have brought\nmatters to a crisis, if he could have forced himself to tell\neverything--the whole truth in all its outrageous improbability--but he\ncould not.\n\nLet those who feel inclined to blame him for lack of firmness consider\nhow difficult and delicate a business it must almost of necessity be for\nanyone to declare openly, in the teeth of common sense and plain facts,\nthat there has been a mistake, and, in point of fact, he is not his own\nson, but his own father.\n\n\"I suppose I must go,\" he thought. \"I needn't dance. Haven't danced\nsince I was a young man. But I can't afford to offend him just now.\"\n\nAnd so he followed the rest into a sort of cloak-room, where the tall\nhats which the boys wore on Sundays were all kept on shelves in white\nbandboxes; and there his hair was brushed, his feet were thrust into\nvery shiny patent leather shoes, and a pair of kid gloves was given out\nto him to put on.\n\nThe dancing lesson was to be held in the \"Dining Hall,\" from which the\nsavour of mutton had not altogether departed. When Paul came in he found\nthe floor cleared and the tables and forms piled up on one side of the\nroom.\n\nBiddlecomb and Tipping and some of the smaller boys were there already,\ntheir gloves and shiny shoes giving them a feeling of ceremony and\nconstraint which they tried to carry off by an uncouth parody of\npoliteness.\n\nSiggers was telling stories of the dances he had been to in town, and\nthe fine girls whose step had exactly suited his own, and Tipping was\nleaning gloomily against the wall listening to something Chawner was\nwhispering in his ear.\n\nThere was a rustle of dresses down the stairs outside, and two thin\nlittle girls, looking excessively proper and prim, came in with an\nelderly gentlewoman who was their governess and wore a _pince-nez_ to\nimpart the necessary suggestion of a superior intellect. They were the\nMiss Mutlows, sisters of one of the day-boarders, and attended the\ncourse by special favour as friends of Dulcie's, who followed them in\nwith a little gleam of shy anticipation in her eyes.\n\nThe Miss Mutlows sat stiffly down on a form, one on each side of her\ngoverness, and all three stared solemnly at the boys, who began to blush\nvividly under the inspection, to unbutton and rebutton their gloves with\ngreat care, and to shift from leg to leg in an embarrassed manner.\n\nDulcie soon singled out poor Mr. Bultitude, who, mindful of Tipping's\nwarning, was doing his very best to avoid her.\n\nShe ran straight to him, laid her hand on his arm and looked into his\nface pleadingly. \"Dick,\" she said, \"you're not sulky still, are you?\"\n\nMr. Bultitude had borne a good deal already, and, not being remarkably\nsweet-natured, he shook the little hand away, half petulant and half\nalarmed. \"I do wish you wouldn't do this sort of thing in public. You'll\ncompromise me, you know!\" he said nervously.\n\nDulcie opened her grey eyes wide, and then a flush came into her cheeks,\nand she made a little disdainful upward movement of her chin.\n\n\"You didn't mind it once,\" she said. \"I thought you might want to dance\nwith me. You liked to last term. But I'm sure I don't care if you choose\nto be disagreeable. Go and dance with Mary Mutlow if you want to, though\nyou did say she danced like a pair of compasses, and I shall tell her\nyou said so, too. And you know you're not a good dancer yourself. _Are_\nyou going to dance with Mary?\"\n\nPaul stamped. \"I tell you I never dance,\" he said. \"I can't dance any\nmore than a lamp-post. You don't seem an ill-natured little girl, but\nwhy on earth can't you let me alone?\"\n\nDulcie's eyes flashed. \"You're a nasty sulky boy,\" she said in an angry\nundertone (all the conversation had, of course, been carried on in\nwhispers). \"I'll never speak to you or look at you again. You're the\nmost horrid boy in the school--and the ugliest!\"\n\nAnd she turned proudly away, though anyone who looked might have seen\nthe fire in her eyes extinguished as she did so. Perhaps Tipping did see\nit, for he scowled at them from his corner.\n\nThere was another sound outside, as of fiddlestrings being twanged by\nthe finger, and, as the boys hastily formed up in two lines down the\ncentre of the room and the Miss Mutlows and Dulcie prepared themselves\nfor the curtsey of state, there came in a little fat man, with\nmutton-chop whiskers and a white face, upon which was written an\nunalterable conviction that his manner and deportment were perfection\nitself.\n\nThe two rows of boys bent themselves stiffly from the back, and Mr.\nBurdekin returned the compliment by an inclusive and stately\ninclination.\n\n\"Good afternoon, madam. Young ladies, I trust I find you well. (The\ncurtsey just a leetle lower, Miss Mutlow--the right foot less drawn\nback. Beautiful! Feet closer at the recovery. Perfect!) Young gentlemen,\ngood evening. Take your usual places, please, all of you, for our\npreliminary exercises. Now, the _chassÃ©e_ round the room. Will you lead\noff, please, Dummer; the hands just lightly touching the shoulders, the\nhead thrown negligently back to balance the figure; the whole deportment\neasy, but not careless. Now, please!\"\n\nAnd, talking all the time with a metrical fluency, he scraped a little\njig on the violin, while Dummer led off a procession which solemnly\ncapered round the room in sundry stages of conscious awkwardness. Mr.\nBultitude shuffled along somehow after the rest, with rebellion at his\nheart and a deep sense of degradation. \"If my clerks were to see me\nnow!\" he thought.\n\nAfter some minutes of this, Mr. Burdekin stopped them and directed sets\nto be formed for \"The Lancers.\"\n\n\"Bultitude,\" said Mr. Burdekin, \"you will take Miss Mutlow, please.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Paul, \"but--ah--I don't dance.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense, sir, you are one of my most promising pupils. You\nmustn't tell me that. Not another word! Come, select your partners.\"\n\nPaul had no option. He was paired off with the tall and rather angular\nyoung lady mentioned, while Dulcie looked on pouting, and snubbed\nTipping, who humbly asked for the pleasure of dancing with her, by\ndeclaring that she meant to dance with Tom.\n\nThe dance began to a sort of rhythmical accompaniment by Mr. Burdekin,\nwho intoned \"Tops advance, retire and cross. Balance at corners. (Very\nnice, Miss Grimstone!) More '_abandon_,' Chawner! Lift the feet more\nfrom the floor. Not so high as that! Oh, dear me! that last figure over\nagain. And slide the feet, oh, slide the feet! (Bultitude, you're\nleaving out all the steps!\")\n\nPaul was dragged, unwilling but unresisting, through it all by his\npartner, who jerked and pushed him into his place without a word, being\napparently under strict orders from the governess not on any account to\nspeak to the boys.\n\nAfter the dance the couples promenaded in a stiff but stately manner\nround the room to a dirge-like march scraped upon the violin, the boys\ntaking the parts of ladies jibbing away from their partners in a highly\nunlady-like fashion, and the boy burdened with the companionship of the\nyounger Miss Mutlow walking along in a very agony of bashfulness.\n\n\"I suppose,\" thought Paul, as he led the way with Miss Mary Mutlow, \"if\nDick were ever to hear of this, he'd think it _funny_. Oh, if I ever get\nthe upper hand of him again----. How much longer, I wonder, shall I have\nto play the fool to this infernal fiddle!\"\n\nBut, if this was bad, worse was to come.\n\nThere was another pause, in which Mr. Burdekin said blandly, \"I wonder\nnow if we have forgotten our sailor's hornpipe. Perhaps Bultitude will\nprove the contrary. If I remember right, he used to perform it with\nsingular correctness. And, let me tell you, there are a great number of\nspurious hornpipe steps in circulation. Come, sir, oblige me by dancing\nit alone!\"\n\nThis was the final straw. It was not to be supposed for one moment that\nMr. Bultitude would lower his dignity in such a preposterous manner.\nBesides, he did not know how to dance the hornpipe.\n\nSo he said, \"I shall do nothing of the sort. I've had quite enough of\nthis--ah--tomfoolery!\"\n\n\"That is a very impolite manner of declining, Bultitude; highly\ndiscourteous and unpolished. I must insist now--really, as a personal\nmatter--upon your going through the sailor's hornpipe. Come, you won't\nmake a scene, I'm sure. You'll oblige me, as a gentleman?\"\n\n\"I tell you I can't!\" said Mr. Bultitude sullenly. \"I never did such a\nthing in my life; it would be enough to kill me at my age!\"\n\n\"This is untrue, sir. Do you mean to say you will not dance the\nhornpipe?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"I'll be damned if I do!\"\n\nThere was unfortunately no possible doubt about the nature of the word\nused--he said it so very distinctly. The governess screamed and called\nher charges to her. Dulcie hid her face, and some of the boys tittered.\n\nMr. Burdekin turned pink. \"After that disgraceful language, sir, in the\npresence of the fairer sex, I have no more to do with you. You will have\nthe goodness to stand in the centre of that form. Gentlemen, select your\npartners for the Highland schottische!\"\n\nMr. Bultitude, by no means sorry to be freed from the irksome necessity\nof dancing with a heart ill-attuned for enjoyment, got up on the form\nand stood looking, sullenly enough, upon the proceedings. The governess\nglowered at him now and then as a monster of youthful depravity; the\nMiss Mutlows glanced up at him as they tripped past, with curiosity not\nunmixed with admiration, but Dulcie steadily avoided looking in his\ndirection.\n\nPaul was just congratulating himself upon his escape when the door\nopened wide, and the Doctor marched slowly and imposingly into the room.\n\nHe did this occasionally, partly to superintend matters, and partly as\nan encouraging mark of approbation. He looked round the class at first\nwith benignant toleration, until his glance took in the bench upon which\nMr. Bultitude was set up. Then his eye slowly travelled up to the level\nof Paul's head, his expression changing meanwhile to a petrifying glare.\n\nIt was not, as Paul instinctively felt, exactly the position in which a\ngentleman who wished to stand well with those in authority over him\nwould prefer to be found. He felt his heart turn to water within him,\nand stared limp and helpless at the Doctor.\n\nThere was an awful silence (Dr. Grimstone was addicted to awful\nsilences; and, indeed, if seldom strictly \"golden,\" silence may often be\ncalled \"iron\"), but at last he inquired, \"And pray what may you be doing\nup there, sir?\"\n\n\"Upon my soul I can't say,\" said Mr. Bultitude feebly. \"Ask that\ngentleman there with the fiddle--he knows.\"\n\nMr. Burdekin was a good-natured, easy-tempered little man, and had\nalready forgotten the affront to his dignity. He was anxious not to get\nthe boy into more trouble.\n\n\"Bultitude was a little inattentive and, I may say, wanting in respect,\nDr. Grimstone,\" he said, putting it as mildly as he could with any\naccuracy; \"so I ventured to place him there as a punishment.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Mr. Burdekin,\" said the Doctor: \"quite right. I am sorry\nthat any boy of mine should have caused you to do so. You are again\nbeginning your career of disorder and rebellion, are you, sir? Go up\ninto the schoolroom at once, and write a dozen copies before tea-time! A\nvery little more eccentricity and insubordination from you, Bultitude,\nand you will reap a full reward--a full reward, sir!\"\n\nSo Mr. Bultitude was driven out of the dancing class in dire\ndisgrace--which would not have distressed him particularly, being only\none more drop in his bitter cup--but that he recognised that now his\nhopes of approaching the Doctor with his burden of woe were fallen like\na card castle. They were fiddled and danced away for at least\ntwenty-four hours--perhaps for ever!\n\nBitterly did he brood over this as he slowly and laboriously copied out\nsundry vain repetitions of such axioms as, \"Cultivate Habits of Courtesy\nand Self-control,\" and \"True Happiness is to be sought in Contentment.\"\nHe saw the prospect of a tolerably severe flogging growing more and more\ndistinct, and felt that he could not present himself to his family with\nthe consciousness of having suffered such an indelible disgrace. His\nfamily! What would become of them in his absence? Would he ever see his\ncomfortable home in Bayswater again?\n\nTea-time came, and after it evening preparation, when Mr. Tinkler\npresided in a feeble and ineffective manner, perpetually suspecting that\nthe faint sniggers he heard were indulged in at his own expense, and\ncalling perfectly innocent victims to account for them.\n\nPaul sat next to Jolland and, in his desperate anxiety to avoid further\nunpleasantness, found himself, as he could not for his life have written\na Latin or a German composition, reduced to copy down his neighbour's\nexercises. This Jolland (who had looked forward to an arrangement of a\nvery opposite kind) nevertheless cheerfully allowed him to do, though he\nexpressed doubts as to the wisdom of a servile imitation--more, perhaps,\nfrom prudence than conscientiousness.\n\nJolland, in the intervals of study, was deeply engaged in the production\nof a small illustrated work of fiction, which he was pleased to call\n_The Adventures of Ben Buterkin at Scool_. It was in a great measure an\nautobiography, and the cuts depicting the hero's flagellations--which\nwere frequent in the course of the narrative--were executed with much\nvigour and feeling.\n\nHe turned out a great number of these works in the course of the term,\nas well as faces in pen and ink with moving tongues and rolling eyes,\nand these he would present to a few favoured friends with a secretive\nand self-depreciatory giggle.\n\nAmidst scenes and companions like these, Paul sat out the evening hours\non his hard seat, which was just at the junction of two forms--an\nexquisitely uncomfortable position, as all who have tried it will\nacknowledge--until the time for going to bed came round again. He\ndreaded the hours of darkness, but there was no help for it--to protest\nwould have been madness just then, and, once more, he was forced to pass\na night under the roof of Crichton House.\n\nIt was even worse than the first, though this was greatly owing to his\nown obstinacy.\n\nThe boys, if less subdued, were in better temper than the evening\nbefore, and found it troublesome to keep up a feud when the first flush\nof resentment had died out. There was a general disposition to forget\nhis departure from the code of schoolboy honour, and give him an\nopportunity of retrieving the past.\n\nBut he would not meet them half-way; his repeated repulses by the Doctor\nand all the difficulties that beset his return to freedom had made him\nvery sulky and snappish. He had not patience or adaptability enough to\nrespond to their advances, and only shrank from their rough good\nnature--which naturally checked the current of good feeling.\n\nThen, when the lights were put out, some one demanded a story. Most of\nthe bedrooms possessed a professional story-teller, and in one there was\na young romancist who began a stirring history the very first night of\nthe term, which always ran on until the night before the holidays, and,\nif his hearers were apt to yawn at the sixth week of it, he himself\nenjoyed and believed in it keenly from beginning to end.\n\nDick Bultitude had been a valued _raconteur_, it appeared, and his\nfather found accordingly, to his disgust, that he was expected to amuse\nthem with a story. When he clearly understood the idea, he rejected it\nwith so savage a snarl, that he soon found it necessary to retire under\nthe bedclothes to escape the general indignation that followed.\n\nFinding that he did not actively resent it (the real Dick would have had\nthe occupant of the nearest bed out by the ears in a minute!), they\nprofited by his prudence to come to his bedside, where they pillowed his\nweary head (with their own pillows) till the slight offered them was\nmore than avenged.\n\nAfter that, Mr. Bultitude, with the breath half beaten out of his body,\nlay writhing and spluttering on his hard, rough bed till long after\nsilence had fallen over the adjoining beds, and the sleepy hum of talk\nin the other bedrooms had died away.\n\nThen he, too, drifted off into wild and troubled dreams, which, at their\nmaddest, were scattered into blankness by a sudden and violent shock,\nwhich jerked him, clutching and grasping at nothing, on to the cold,\nbare boards, where he rolled, shivering.\n\n\"An earthquake!\" he thought, \"an explosion ... gas--or dynamite! He must\ngo and call the children ... Boaler ... the plate!\"\n\nBut the reality to which he woke was worse still. Tipping and Coker had\nbeen patiently pinching themselves to keep awake until their enemy\nshould be soundly asleep, in order to enjoy the exquisite pleasure of\nletting down the mattress; and, too dazed and frightened even to swear,\nPaul gathered up his bedclothes and tried to draw them about him as well\nas he might, and seek sleep, which had lost its security.\n\nThe GarudÃ¢ Stone had done one grim and cruel piece of work at least in\nits time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. _Cutting the Knot_\n\n\"A Crowd is not Company; And Faces are but a Gallery of Pictures;\nAnd Talke but a _Tinckling Cymball_, where there is no _Love_.\"\n                                                       --BACON.\n\n\nOnce more Mr. Bultitude rose betimes, dressed noiselessly, and stole\ndown to the cold schoolroom, where one gas-jet was burning palely--for\nthe morning was raw and foggy.\n\nThis time, however, he was not alone. Mr. Blinkhorn was sitting at his\nlittle table in the corner, correcting exercises, with his chilly hands\ncased in worsted mittens. He looked up as Paul came in, and nodded\nkindly.\n\nPaul went straight to the fire, and stood staring into it with\nlack-lustre eye, too apathetic even to be hopeless, for the work of\nenlightening the Doctor seemed more terrible and impossible than ever,\nand he began to see that, if the only way of escape lay there, he had\nbetter make up his mind with what philosophy he could to adapt himself\nto his altered circumstances, and stay on for the rest of the term.\n\nBut the prospect was so doleful and so blank, that he drew a heavy sigh\nas he thought of it. Mr. Blinkhorn heard it, and rose awkwardly from the\nrickety little writing-table, knocking over a pile of marble-covered\ncopy-books as he did so.\n\nThen he crossed over to Paul and laid a hand gently on his shoulder.\n\"Look here,\" he said: \"why don't you confide in me? Do you think I'm\nblind to what has happened to you? I can see the change in you--if\nothers cannot. Why not trust me?\"\n\nMr. Bultitude looked up into his face, which had an honest interest and\nkindliness in it, and his heart warmed with a faint hope. If this young\nman had been shrewd enough to guess at his unhappy secret, might he not\nbe willing to intercede with the Doctor for him? He looked\ngood-natured--he would trust him.\n\n\"Do you mean to say really,\" he asked, with more cordiality than he had\nspoken for a long time, \"that you--see--the--a--the difference?\"\n\n\"I saw it almost directly,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, with mild triumph.\n\n\"That's the most extraordinary thing,\" said Paul, \"and yet it ought to\nbe evident enough, to be sure. But no, you can't have guessed the real\nstate of things!\"\n\n\"Listen, and stop me if I'm wrong. Within the last few days a great\nchange has been at work within you. You are not the idle, thoughtless,\nmischievous boy who left here for his holidays----\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"I'll swear I'm not!\"\n\n\"There is no occasion for such strong expressions. But, at all events,\nyou come back here an altogether different being. Am I right in saying\nso?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Paul, overjoyed at being so thoroughly understood,\n\"perfectly. You're a very intelligent young man, sir. Shake hands. Why,\nI shouldn't be surprised, after that, if you knew how it all happened?\"\n\n\"That too,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn smiling, \"I can guess. It arose, I doubt\nnot, in a wish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Paul, \"you've hit it again. You're a conjurer, sir, by Gad\nyou are!\"\n\n\"Don't say 'by Gad,' Bultitude; it's inconsistent. It began, I was\nsaying, in a wish, half unconscious perhaps, to be something other than\nwhat you had been----\"\n\n\"I was a fool,\" groaned Mr. Bultitude, \"yes, that was the way it began!\"\n\n\"Then insensibly the wish worked a gradual transformation in your nature\n(you are old enough to follow me?).\"\n\n\"Old enough for him to follow _me_!\" thought Paul; but he was too\npleased to be annoyed. \"Hardly gradual I should say,\" he said aloud.\n\"But go on, sir, pray go on. I see you know all about it.\"\n\n\"At first the other part of you struggled against the new feelings. You\nstrove to forget them--you even tried to resume your old habits, your\nformer way of life--but to no purpose; and when you came here, you found\nno fellowship amongst your companions----\"\n\n\"Quite out of the question!\" said Paul.\n\n\"Their pleasures give you no delight----\"\n\n\"Not a bit!\"\n\n\"They, on their side, perhaps misunderstand your lack of interest in\ntheir pursuits. They cannot see--how should they?--that you have altered\nyour mode of life, and when they catch the difference between you and\nthe Richard Bultitude they knew, why, they are apt to resent it.\"\n\n\"They are,\" agreed Mr. Bultitude: \"they resent it in a confounded\ndisagreeable way, you know. Why, I assure you, that only last night I\nwas----\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, holding up one hand, \"complaints are\nunmanly. But I see you wonder at my knowing all this?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Paul, \"I am rather surprised.\"\n\n\"What would you say if I told you I had undergone it myself in my time?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me there are _two_ GarudÃ¢ Stones in this\nmiserable world!\" cried Paul, thoroughly astonished.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean now, but I can say with truth that I too\nhave had my experiences--my trials. Months ago, from certain signs, I\nnoticed, I foresaw that this was coming upon you.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Bultitude, \"I think, in common decency, you might have\nwarned me. A post-card would have done it. I should have been better\nprepared to meet this, then!\"\n\n\"It would have been worse than fruitless to attempt to hurry on the\ncrisis. It might have even prevented what I fondly hoped would come to\npass.\"\n\n\"Fondly hoped!\" said Paul, \"upon my word you speak plainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn. \"You see I knew the Dick Bultitude that was,\nso well; he was frolicksome, impulsive, mischievous even, but under it\nall there lay a nature of sterling worth.\"\n\n\"Sterling worth!\" cried Paul. \"A scoundrel, I tell you, a heartless,\nselfish young scoundrel. Call things by their right names, if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, \"this extreme self-depreciation is morbid,\nvery morbid. There was no actual vice.\"\n\n\"No actual vice! Why, God bless my soul, do you call ingratitude--the\nbasest, most unfilial, most treacherous ingratitude--no vice, sir? You\nmay be a very excellent young man, but if you gloss over things in that\nfashion, your moral sense must be perverted, sir--strangely perverted.\"\n\n\"There were faults on both sides, I fear,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, growing\na little scandalised by the boy's odd warmth of expression. \"I have\nheard something of what you had to bear with. On the one hand, a father,\nundemonstrative, stern, easily provoked; on the other, a son,\nthoughtless, forgetful, and at times it may be even wilful. But you are\ntoo sensitive; you think too much of what seems to me a not unnatural\n(although of course improper) protest against coldness and injustice. I\nshould be the last to encourage a child against a parent, but, to\ncomfort your self-reproach, I think it right to assure you that, in my\njudgment, the outburst you refer to was very excusable.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Paul, \"you do? You call that comfort? Excusable! Why, what\nthe dooce do you mean, sir? You're taking the other side now!\"\n\n\"This is not the language of penitence, Bultitude,\" said poor Mr.\nBlinkhorn, disheartened and bewildered. \"Remember, you have put off the\nOld Man now!\"\n\n\"I'm not likely to forget _that_,\" said Paul; \"I only wish I could see\nmy way to putting him on again!\"\n\n\"You want to be your old self again?\" gasped Mr. Blinkhorn.\n\n\"Why, of course I do,\" said Paul angrily; \"I'm not an idiot!\"\n\n\"You are weary of the struggle so soon?\" said the other with reproach.\n\n\"Weary? I tell you I'm sick of it! If I had only known what was in store\nfor me before I had made such a fool of myself!\"\n\n\"This is horrible!\" said Mr. Blinkhorn--\"I ought not to listen to you.\"\n\n\"But you must,\" urged Paul; \"I tell you I can't stand it any longer. I'm\nnot fit for it at my age. You must see that yourself, and you must make\nGrimstone see it too!\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Mr. Blinkhorn firmly. \"Nor do I see how that would help\nyou. I will not let you go back in this deplorable way. You must nerve\nyourself to go on now in the path you have chosen; you must force your\nschoolfellows to love and respect you in your new character. Come, take\ncourage! After all, in spite of your altered life, there is no reason\nwhy you should not be a frank and happy-hearted boy, you know.\"\n\n\"A frank and happy-hearted fiddlestick!\" cried Paul rudely (he was so\ndisgusted at the suggestion); \"don't talk rubbish, sir! I thought you\nwere going to show me some way out of all this, and instead of that,\nknowing the shameful way I've been treated, you can stand there and\ncalmly recommend me to stay on here and be happy-hearted and frank!\"\n\n\"You must be calm, Bultitude, or I shall leave you. Listen to reason.\nYou are here for your good. Youth, it has been beautifully said, is the\nspringtime of life. Though you may not believe it, you will never be\nhappier than you are now. Our schooldays are----\"\n\nBut Mr. Bultitude could not tamely be mocked with the very platitudes\nthat had brought him all his misery--he cut the master short in a\nviolent passion. \"This is too much!\" he cried--\"you shall not palm off\nthat miserable rubbish on me. I see through it. It's a plot to keep me\nhere, and you're in it. It's false imprisonment, and I'll write to the\n_Times_. I'll expose the whole thing!\"\n\n\"This violence is only ridiculous,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn. \"If I were not\ntoo pained by it, I should feel it my duty to report your language to\nthe Doctor. As it is, you have bitterly disappointed me; I can't\nunderstand it at all. You seemed so subdued, so softened lately. But\nuntil you come to me and say you regret this, I must decline to have\nanything more to say to you. Take your book and sit down in your place!\"\n\nAnd he went back to his exercises, looking puzzled and pained. The fact\nwas, he was an ardent believer in the Good Boy of a certain order of\nschool tales--the boy who is seized with a sudden conviction of the\nintrinsic baseness of boyhood, and does all in his power to get rid of\nthe harmful taint; the boy who renounces his old comrades and his\nnatural tastes (which after all seldom have any serious harm in them),\nto don a panoply of priggishness which is too often kick-proof.\n\nThis kind of boy is rare enough at most English schools, but Mr.\nBlinkhorn had been educated at a large Nonconformist College, where\n\"Revivals\" and \"Awakenings\" were periodical, and undoubtedly did produce\nchanges of character violent enough, but sadly short in duration.\n\nHe was always waiting for some such boy to come to him with his\nconfession of moral worthlessness and vows of unnatural perfection, and\nwas too simple and earnest and good himself to realise that such states\nof the youthful mind are not unfrequently merely morbid and hysterical,\nand too often degenerate into Pharisaism, or worse still, hypocrisy.\n\nSo when he noticed Mr. Bultitude's silence and depression, his studied\nwithdrawal from the others and his evident want of sympathy with them,\nhe believed he saw the symptoms of a conscience at work, and that he had\nfound his reformed boy at last.\n\nIt was a very unfortunate misunderstanding, for it separated Paul from,\nperhaps, the only person who would have had the guilelessness to believe\nhis incredible story, and the good nature to help him to find escape\nfrom his misfortunes.\n\nMr. Bultitude on his part was more angry and disgusted than ever. He\nbegan to see that there was a muddle somewhere, and that his identity\nwas unsuspected still. This young man, for all his fair speaking and\npretended shrewdness, was no conjurer after all. He was left to rely on\nhis own resources, and he had begun to lose all confidence in their\npower to extricate him.\n\nAs he brooded over this, the boys straggled down as before, and looked\nover their lessons for the day in a dull, lifeless manner. The cold,\nunsatisfying breakfast, and the half-hour assigned to \"chevy,\" followed\nin due course, and after that Paul found himself set down with a class\nto await the German master, Herr Stohwasser.\n\nHe had again tried to pull himself together and approach the Doctor with\nhis protest, but no sooner did he find himself near his presence than\nhis heart began to leap wildly and then retired down towards his boots,\nleaving him hoarse, palpitating, and utterly blank of ideas.\n\nIt was no use--and he resigned himself for yet another day of unwelcome\ninstruction.\n\nThe class was in a little room on the basement floor, with a linen-press\ntaking up one side, some bare white deal tables and forms, and, on the\nwalls, a few coloured German prints. They sat there talking and\nlaughing, taking no notice of Mr. Bultitude, until the German master\nmade his appearance.\n\nHe was by no means a formidable person, though stout and tall. He wore\nbig round owlish spectacles, and his pale broad face and long nose,\ncombined with a wild crop of light hair and a fierce beard, gave him the\nincongruous appearance of a sheep looking out of a gun-port.\n\nHe took his place with an air of tremendous determination to enforce a\nhard morning's work on the book they were reading--a play of Schiller's,\nof the plot of which, it is needless to say, no one of his pupils had or\ncared to have the vaguest notion, having long since condemned the whole\nsubject, with insular prejudice, as \"rot.\"\n\n\"Now, please,\" said Herr Stohwasser, \"where we left off last term. Third\nact, first scene--Court before Tell's house. Tell is vid the carpenter\naxe, Hedwig vid a domestig labour occupied. Walter and Wilhelm in the\ndepth sport with a liddle gross-bow. Biddlegom, you begin. Walter\n(sings).\"\n\nBut Biddlecomb was in a conversational mood, and willing to postpone the\ntask of translation, so he merely inquired, with an air of extreme\ninterest, how Herr Stohwasser's German Grammar was getting on.\n\nThis was a subject on which (as he perhaps knew) the German never could\nresist enlarging, for in common with most German masters, he was giving\nbirth to a new Grammar, which, from the daring originality of its plan,\nand its extreme simplicity, was destined to supersede all other similar\nworks.\n\n\"Ach,\" he said, \"it is brogressing. I haf just gompleted a gomprehensive\ntable of ze irregular virps, vith ze eggserzizes upon zem. And zere is\nfurther an appendeeks which in itself gontains a goncise view of all ze\nvort-blays possible in the Charman tong. But, come, let us gontinue vith\nour Tell!\"\n\n\"What are vort-blays?\" persisted Biddlecomb insidiously, having no idea\nof continuing with his Tell just yet.\n\n\"A vort-blay,\" exclaimed Herr Stohwasser; \"it is English, nicht so? A\nsporting vid vorts--a 'galembour'--a--Gott pless me, vat you call a\n'pon.'\"\n\n\"Like the one you made when you were a young man?\" Jolland called out\nfrom the lower end of the table.\n\n\"Yes; tell us the one you made when you were a young man,\" the class\nentreated, with flattering eagerness.\n\nHerr Stohwasser began to laugh with slow, deep satisfaction; the\nsatisfaction of a successful achievement. \"Hah, you remember dat!\" he\nsaid, \"ah, yes, I make him when a yong man; but, mind you, he was not a\npon--he was a '_choke_.' I haf told you all about him before.\"\n\n\"We've forgotten it,\" said Biddlecomb: \"tell it us again.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact this joke, in all its lights, was tolerably familiar\nto most of them by this time, but, either on its individual merits, or\nperhaps because it compared favourably with the sterner alternative of\ntranslating, it was periodically in request, and always met with\nevergreen appreciation.\n\nHerr Stohwasser beamed with the pride of authorship. Like the celebrated\nScotchman, he \"jocked wi' deeficulty,\" and the outcome of so much\nlabour was dear to him.\n\n\"I zent him into ze Charman _Kladderadatch_ (it is a paper like your\n_Ponch_). It--mein choke--was upon ze Schleswig-Holstein gomplication;\nze beginning was in this way----\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to set out in great length all the circumstances which\nhad given materials for his \"choke,\" with the successive processes by\nwhich he had shaped and perfected it, passing on to a recital of the\nmasterpiece itself, and ending up by a philosophical analysis of the\nsame, which must have placed his pupils in full possession of the point,\nfor they laughed consumedly.\n\n\"I dell you zis,\" he said, \"not to aggustom your minds vid frivolity and\nlightness, but as a lesson in ze gonstruction of ze langwitch. If you\ncan choke in Charman, you will be able also to gonverse in Charman.\"\n\n\"Did the German what's-its-name print your joke?\" inquired Coggs.\n\n\"It has not appeared yet,\" Herr Stohwasser confessed; \"it takes a long\ntime to get an imbortant choke like that out in brint. But I vait--I\nwrite to ze editor every week--and I vait.\"\n\n\"Why don't you put it in your Grammar?\" suggested Tipping.\n\n\"I haf--ze greater part of it--(it vas a long choke, but I gompressed\nhim). If I haf time, some day I will make anozer liddle choke to\naggompany, begause I vant my Crammar to be a goot Crammar, you\nunderstandt. And now to our Tell. Really you beople do noding but\nchadder!\"\n\nAll this, of course, had no interest for Mr. Bultitude, but it left him\nfree to pursue his own thoughts in peace, and indeed this lesson would\nnever have been recorded here, but for two circumstances which will\npresently appear, both of which had no small effect on his fortunes.\n\nHe sat nearest the window, and looked out on the pinched and drooping\nlaurels in the enclosure, which were damp with frost melting in the\nsunshine. Over the wall he could see the tops of passing vehicles, the\ncountry carrier's cart, the railway parcels van, the fly from the\nstation. He envied even the drivers; their lot was happier than his!\n\nHis thoughts were busy with Dick. Oddly enough, it had scarcely occurred\nto him before to speculate on what he might be doing in his absence; he\nhad thought chiefly about himself. But now he gave his attention to the\nsubject, what new horrors it opened up! What might not become of his\nwell-conducted household under the rash rule of a foolish schoolboy! The\noffice, too--who could say what mischief Dick might not be doing there,\nunder the cover of his own respectable form?\n\nThen it might seem good to him any day to smash the GarudÃ¢ Stone, and\nafter that there would be no hope of matters being ever set right again!\n\nAnd yet, miserable coward and fool that he was, with everything\ndepending upon his losing no time to escape, he could not screw up his\ncourage, and say the words that were to set him free.\n\nAll at once--and this is one of the circumstances that make the German\nlesson an important stage in this story--an idea suggested itself to him\nquite dazzling by its daring and brilliancy.\n\nSome may wonder, when they hear what it was, why he never thought of it\nbefore, and it is somewhat surprising, but by no means without\nprecedent. Artemus Ward has told us somewhere of a ferocious bandit who\nwas confined for sixteen years in solitary captivity, before the notion\nof escape ever occurred to him. When it did, he opened the window and\ngot out.\n\nPerhaps a similar passiveness on Mr. Bultitude's part was due to a very\nnatural and proper desire to do everything without scandal, and in a\nlegitimate manner; to march out, as it were, with the honours of war.\nPerhaps it was simple dullness. The fact remains that it was not till\nthen that he saw a way of recovering his lost position, without the\ndisagreeable necessity of disclosing his position to anyone at Crichton\nHouse.\n\nHe had still--thank Heaven--the five shillings he had given Dick. He had\nnot thrown them away with the other articles in his mad passion. Five\nshillings was not much, but it was more than enough to pay for a\nthird-class fare to town. He had only to watch his opportunity, slip\naway to the station, and be at home again, defying the usurper, before\nanyone at Crichton House had discovered his absence.\n\nHe might go that very day, and the delight of this thought--the complete\nreaction from blank despair to hope--was so intense that he could not\nhelp rubbing his hands stealthily under the table, and chuckling with\nglee at his own readiness of resource.\n\nWhen we are most elated, however, there is always a counteracting agent\nat hand to bring us down again to our proper level, or below it. The\nRoman general in the triumph never really needed the slave in the\nchariot to dash his spirits--he had his friends there already; the\nguests at an Egyptian dinner must have brought their own skeletons.\n\nThere was a small flaxen-haired little boy sitting next to Mr.\nBultitude, seemingly a quite inoffensive being, who at this stage served\nto sober him by furnishing another complication.\n\n\"Oh, I say, Bultitude,\" he piped shrilly in Paul's ear, \"I forgot all\nabout it. Where's my rabbit?\"\n\nThe unreasonable absurdity of such a question annoyed him excessively.\n\"Is this a time,\" he said reprovingly, \"to talk of rabbits? Mind your\nbook, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, I daresay,\" grumbled little Porter, the boy in question: \"it's all\nvery well, but I want my rabbit.\"\n\n\"Hang it, sir,\" said Paul angrily, \"do you suppose I'm sitting on it?\"\n\n\"You promised to bring me back a rabbit,\" persisted Porter doggedly;\n\"you know you did, and it's a beastly shame. I mean to have that\nrabbit, or know the reason why.\"\n\nAt the other end of the table Biddlecomb had again dexterously allured\nHerr Stohwasser into the meshes of conversation; this time upon the\nquestion (_Ã  propos de bottes_) of street performances. \"I vill tell you\na gurious thing,\" he was saying, \"vat happened to me de oder day ven I\nvas valking down de Strandt. I saw a leedle gommon dirty boy with a tall\nround hat on him, and he stand in a side street right out in de road,\nand he take off his tall round hat, and he put it on de ground, and he\nstand still and look zo at it. So I shtop too, to see vat he vould do\nnext. And bresently he take out a large sheet of baper and tear it in\nfour pieces very garefully, and stick zem round de tall round hat, and\nput it on his head again, and zen he set it down on de grount and look\nat it vonce more, and all de time he never speak von vort. And I look\nand look and vonder vat he would do next. And a great growd of beoples\ncom, and zey look and vonder too. And zen all at once de leedle dirty\nboy he take out all de paper and put on de hat, and he valk avay,\nlaughing altogetter foolishly at zomzing I did not understand at all. I\nhaf been thinking efer since vat in the vorldt he do all zat nonsence\nfor. And zere is von ozer gurious thing I see in your London streets zat\nvery same day. Zere vas a poor house cat dat had been by a cab overrun\nas I passed by, and von man vith a kind varm heart valk up and stamp it\non de head for to end its pain. And anozer man vith anozer kind heart,\nhe gom up directly and had not seen de cat overrun, but he see de first\nman stamping and he knock him down for ill-treating animals; it was\nquite gurious to see; till de policeman arrest dem both for fighting.\nGoggs, degline 'Katze,' and gif me ze berfect and bast barticiple of\n'kampfen,' to fight.\" This last relapse into duty was caused by the\nsudden entrance of the Doctor, who stood at the door looking on for some\ntime with a general air of being intimately acquainted with Schiller as\nan author, before suggesting graciously that it was time to dismiss the\nclass.\n\nWednesday was a half-holiday at Crichton House, and so, soon after\ndinner, Paul found himself marshalled with the rest in a procession\nbound for the football field. They marched two and two, Chawner and\nthree of the other elder boys leading with the ball and four goal-posts\nornamented with coloured calico flags, and Mr. Blinkhorn and Mr. Tinkler\nbringing up the rear.\n\nMr. Bultitude was paired with Tom Grimstone, who, after eyeing him\naskance for some time, could control his curiosity no longer.\n\n\"I say, Dick,\" he began, \"what's the matter with you this term?\"\n\n\"My name is not Dick,\" said Paul stiffly.\n\n\"Oh, if you're so particular then,\" said Tom: \"but, without humbug, what\nis the matter?\"\n\n\"You see a change then,\" said Paul, \"you do see a difference, eh?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" said Tom expressively. \"You've come back what I call a beastly\nsneak, you know, this term. The other fellows don't like it; they'll\nsend you to Coventry unless you take care.\"\n\n\"I wish they would,\" said Paul.\n\n\"You don't talk like the same fellow either,\" continued Tom; \"you use\nsuch fine language, and you're always in a bait, and yet you don't stick\nup for yourself as you used to. Look here, tell me (we were always\nchums), is it one of your larks?\"\n\n\"Larks!\" said Paul. \"I'm in a fine mood for larks. No, it's not one of\nmy larks.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your old governor has been making a cad of himself then, and\nyou're out of sorts about it.\"\n\n\"I'll thank you not to speak about him in that way,\" said Paul, \"in my\npresence.\"\n\n\"Why,\" grumbled Tom, \"I'm sure you said enough about him yourself last\nterm. It's my belief you're imitating him now.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Paul, \"and what makes you think that?\"\n\n\"Why, you go about strutting and swelling just like he did when he came\nabout sending you here. I say, do you know what Mums said about him\nafter he went away?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"your mother struck me as a very sensible and\nagreeable woman--if I may say so to her son.\"\n\n\"Well, Mums said your governor seemed to leave you here just like they\nleave umbrellas at picture galleries, and she believed he had a\nlarge-sized money-bag inside him instead of a heart.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Paul, with great disgust, for he had thought Mrs. Grimstone a\nwoman of better taste; \"your mother said that, did she? Vastly\nentertaining to be sure--ha, ha! He would be pleased to know she thought\nthat, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Tell him, and see what he says,\" suggested Tom; \"he is an awful brute\nto you though, isn't he?\"\n\n\"If,\" growled Mr. Bultitude, \"slaving from morning till night to provide\neducation and luxury for a thankless brood of unprofitable young vipers\nis 'being a brute,' I suppose he is.\"\n\n\"Why, you're sticking up for him now!\" said Tom. \"I thought he was so\nstrict with you. Wouldn't let you have any fun at home, and never took\nyou to pantomimes?\"\n\n\"And why should he, sir, why should he? Tell me that. Tell me why a man\nis to be hunted out of his comfortable chair after a well-earned dinner,\nto go and sit in a hot theatre and a thorough draught, yawning at the\nmiserable drivel managers choose to call a pantomime? Now in my young\ndays there _were_ pantomimes. I tell you, sir, I've seen----\"\n\n\"Oh, if you're satisfied, I don't care!\" said Tom, astonished at this\napparent change of front. \"If you choose to come back and play the\ncorker like this, it's your look-out. Only, if you knew what Sproule\nmajor said about you just now----\"\n\n\"I don't want to know,\" said Paul; \"it doesn't concern me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it doesn't concern you what pa thinks either? Dad told Mums\nlast night that he was altogether at a loss to know how to deal with\nyou, you had come back so queer and unruly. And he said, let me see, oh,\nhe said that 'if he didn't see an alteration very soon he should resort\nto more drastic measures'--drastic measures is Latin for a whopping.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" thought Paul, \"I haven't a moment to lose! he might\n'resort to drastic measures' this very evening. I can't change my nature\nat my time of life. I must run for it, and soon.\"\n\nThen he said aloud to Tom, \"Can you tell me, my--my young friend, if,\nsupposing a boy were to ask to leave the field--saying for instance that\nhe was not well and thought he should be better at home--whether he\nwould be allowed to go?\"\n\n\"Of course he would,\" said Tom, \"you ought to know that by this time.\nYou've only to ask Blinkhorn or Tinkler; they'll let you go right\nenough.\"\n\nPaul saw his course quite clearly now, and was overcome with relief and\ngratitude. He wrung the astonished Tom's hand warmly; \"Thank you,\" he\nsaid, briskly and cheerfully, \"thank you. I'm really uncommonly obliged\nto you. You're a very intelligent boy. I should like to give you\nsixpence.\"\n\nBut although Tom used no arguments to dissuade him, Mr. Bultitude\nremembered his position in time, and prudently refrained from such\nill-judged generosity. Sixpences were of vital importance now, when he\nexpected to be starting so soon on his perilous journey.\n\nAnd so they reached the field where the game was to be played, and where\nPaul was resolved to have one desperate throw for liberty and home. He\nwas more excited than anxious as he thought of it, and it certainly did\nseem as if all the chances were in his favour, and that fortune must\nhave forsaken him indeed, if anything were allowed to prevent his\nescape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. _Unbending the Bow_\n\n     \"I pray you, give me leave to go from hence,\n     I am not well;\"\n                                       _Merchant of Venice._\n\n     \"He will not blush, that has a father's heart,\n     To take in childish plays a childish part;\n     But bends his sturdy back to any toy\n     That youth takes pleasure in,--to please his boy.\"\n\n\nThe football field was a large one, bounded on two sides by tall wooden\npalings, and on the other two by a hedge and a new shingled road,\nseparated from the field by a post and rails.\n\nTwo of the younger boys, proud of their office, raced down to the\nfurther end to set up the goal-posts. The rest lounged idly about\nwithout attempting to begin operations, except the new boy Kiffin, who\nwas seen walking apart from the rest, diligently studying the \"rules of\nthe game of football,\" as laid down in a small _Boy's Own Pocket Book\nand Manual of Outdoor Sports_, with which he had been careful to provide\nhimself.\n\nAt last Tipping suggested that they had better begin, and proposed that\nMr. Blinkhorn and himself should toss up for the choice of sides, and\nthis being done, Mr. Bultitude presently, to his great dismay, heard his\nname mentioned. \"I'll have young Bultitude,\" said Tipping; \"he used to\nplay up decently. Look here, you young beggar, you're on my side, and if\nyou don't play up it will be the worse for you!\"\n\nIt was not worth while, however, to protest, since he would so soon be\nrid of the whole crew for ever, and so Paul followed Tipping and his\ntrain with dutiful submission, and the game began.\n\nIt was not a spirited performance. Mr. Tinkler, who was not an athlete,\nretired at once to the post and rails, on which he settled himself to\nenjoy a railway novel with a highly stimulating cover. Mr. Blinkhorn,\nwho had more conscientious views of his office, charged about\nvigorously, performing all kinds of wonders with the ball, though\nevidently more from a sense of duty than with any idea of enjoyment.\n\nTipping occasionally took the trouble to oppose him, but as a concession\nmerely, and with a parade of being under no necessity to do so; and\nthese two, with a very small following of enthusiasts on either side,\nwaged a private and confidential kind of warfare in different parts of\nthe field, while the others made no pretence of playing for the present,\nbut strolled about in knots, exchanging and bartering the treasures\nvaluable in the sight of schoolboys, and gossiping generally.\n\nAs for Paul, he did not clearly understand what \"playing up\" might mean.\nHe had not indulged in football since he was a genuine boy, and then\nonly in a rudimentary and primitive form, and without any particular\nfondness for the exercise. But being now, in spirit at all events, a\nprecise elderly person, with a decided notion of taking care of himself,\nhe was resolved that not even Tipping should compel him to trust his\nperson within range of that dirty brown globe, which whistled past his\near or seemed spinning towards his stomach with such a hideous\nsuggestion of a cannon-ball about it.\n\nAll the ghastly instances, too, of accidents to life and limb in the\nfootball field came unpleasantly into his memory, and he saw the\ninadvisability of mingling with the crowd and allowing himself to be\nkicked violently on the shins.\n\nSo he trotted industriously about at a safe distance in order to allay\nsuspicion, while waiting for a good opportunity to put his scheme of\nescape into execution.\n\nAt last he could wait no longer, for the fearful thought occurred to\nhim, that if he remained there much longer, the Doctor--who, as he knew\nfrom Dick, always came to superintend, if not to share the sports of his\npupils--might make his appearance, and then his chance would be lost for\nthe present, for he knew too well that he should never find courage to\nask permission from _him_.\n\nWith a beating heart he went up to Mr. Tinkler, who was still on the\nfence with his novel, and asked as humbly as he could bring himself to\ndo:\n\n\"If you please, sir, will you allow me to go home? I'm--I'm not feeling\nat all well.\"\n\n\"Not well! What's the matter with you?\" said Mr. Tinkler, without\nlooking up.\n\nPaul had not prepared himself for details, and the sudden question\nrather threw him off his guard.\n\n\"A slight touch of liver,\" he said at length. \"It takes me after meals\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"Liver!\" said Mr. Tinkler, \"you've no right to such a thing at your age;\nit's all nonsense, you know. Run in and play, that'll set you up again.\"\n\n\"It's fatal, sir,\" said Paul. \"My doctor expressly warned me against\ntaking any violent exercise soon after luncheon. If you knew what liver\nis, you wouldn't say so!\"\n\nMr. Tinkler stared, as well he might, but making nothing of it, and\nbeing chiefly anxious not to be interrupted any longer, only said, \"Oh,\nwell, don't bother me; I daresay it's all right. Cut along!\"\n\nSo Mr. Bultitude was free; the path lay open to him now. He knew he\nwould have little difficulty in finding his way to the station, and,\nonce there, he would have the whole afternoon in which to wait for a\ntrain to town.\n\n\"I've managed that excellently,\" he thought, as he ran blithely off,\nalmost like the boy he seemed. \"Not the slightest hitch. I defy the\nfates themselves to stop me now!\"\n\nBut the fates are ladies, and--not of course that it\nfollows--occasionally spiteful. It is very rash indeed to be ungallant\nenough to defy them--they have such an unpleasant habit of accepting the\nchallenge.\n\nMr. Bultitude had hardly got clear of the groups scattered about the\nfield, when he met a small flaxen-haired boy, who was just coming down\nto join the game. It was Porter, his neighbour of the German lesson.\n\n\"There you are, Bultitude, then,\" he said in his squeaky voice: \"I want\nyou.\"\n\n\"I can't stop,\" said Paul, \"I'm in a hurry--another time.\"\n\n\"Another time won't do,\" said little Porter, laying hold of him by his\njacket. \"I want that rabbit.\"\n\nThis outrageous demand took Mr. Bultitude's breath away. He had no idea\nwhat rabbit was referred to, or why he should be required to produce\nsuch an animal at a moment's notice. This was the second time an\ninconvenient small boy had interfered between him and liberty. He would\nnot be baffled twice. He tried to shake off his persecutor.\n\n\"I tell you, my good boy, I haven't such a thing about me. I haven't\nindeed. I don't even know what you're talking about.\"\n\nThis denial enraged Porter.\n\n\"I say, you fellows,\" he called out, \"come here! Do make Bultitude give\nme my rabbit. He says he doesn't know anything about it now!\"\n\nAt this several of the loungers came up, glad of a distraction.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" some of them asked.\n\n\"Why,\" whined Porter, \"he promised to bring me back a rabbit this term,\nand now he pretends he does not know anything about it. Make him say\nwhat he's done with it!\"\n\nMr. Bultitude was not usually ready of resource, but now he had what\nseemed a happy thought.\n\n\"Gad!\" he cried, pretending to recollect it, \"so I did--to be sure, a\nrabbit, of course, how could I forget it? It's--it's a splendid rabbit.\nI'll go and fetch it!\"\n\n\"Will you?\" cried Porter, half relieved. \"Where is it, then?\"\n\n\"Where?\" said Paul sharply (he was growing positively brilliant). \"Why,\nin my playbox to be sure; where should it be?\"\n\n\"It isn't in your playbox, I know,\" put in Siggers: \"because I saw it\nturned out yesterday and there was no rabbit then. Besides, how could a\nrabbit live in a playbox? He's telling lies. I can see it by his face.\nHe hasn't any rabbit!\"\n\n\"Of course I haven't!\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"How should I? I'm not a\nconjurer. It's not a habit of mine to go about with rabbits concealed on\nmy person. What's the use of coming to me like this? It's absurd, you\nknow; perfectly absurd!\"\n\nThe crowd increased until there was quite a ring formed round Mr.\nBultitude and the indignant claimant, and presently Tipping came\nbustling up.\n\n\"What's the row here, you fellows?\" he said. \"Bultitude again, of\ncourse. What's he been doing now?\"\n\n\"He had a rabbit he said he was keeping for me,\" explained little\nPorter: \"and now he won't give it up or tell me what he's done with it.\"\n\n\"He has some mice he ought to give us, too,\" said one or two new-comers,\nedging their way to the front.\n\nMr. Bultitude was of course exceedingly annoyed by this unlooked-for\ninterruption, and still more by such utterly preposterous claims on him\nfor animals; however, it was easy to explain that he had no such things\nin his possession, and after that of course no more could be said. He\nwas beginning to disclaim all liability, when Siggers stopped him.\n\n\"Keep that for the present,\" he said. \"I say, we ought to have a regular\ntrial over this, and get at the truth of it properly. Let's fetch him\nalong to the goal-posts and judge him!\"\n\nHe fixed upon the goal-posts as being somehow more formal, and, as his\nproposal was well received, two of them grasped Mr. Bultitude by the\ncollar and dragged him along in procession to the appointed spot between\nthe two flags, while Siggers followed in what he conceived to be a\nhighly judicial manner, and evidently enjoying himself prodigiously.\n\nPaul, though highly indignant, allowed himself to be led along without\nresistance. It was safest to humour them, for after all it would not\nlast long, and when they were tired of baiting him he could watch his\ntime and slip quietly away.\n\nWhen they reached the goal-posts Siggers arranged them in a circle,\nplacing himself, the hapless Paul, and his accusers in the centre. \"You\nchaps had better all be jurymen,\" he said. \"I'll be judge, and unless he\nmakes a clean breast of it,\" he added with judicial impartiality, \"the\ncourt will jolly well punch his ugly young head off.\"\n\nSiggers' father was an Old Bailey barrister in good and rather sharp\npractice, so that it was clearly the son's mission to preside on this\noccasion. But unfortunately his hour of office was doomed to be a brief\none, for Mr. Blinkhorn, becoming aware that the game was being still\nmore scantily supported, and noticing the crowd at the goal, came up to\nknow the reason of it at a long camel-like trot, his hat on the back of\nhis head, his mild face flushed with exertion, and his pebble glasses\ngleaming in the winter sunshine.\n\n\"What are you all doing here? Why don't you join the game? I've come\nhere to play football with you, and how can I do it if you all slink off\nand leave me to play by myself?\" he asked with pathos.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Siggers, alarmed at the threatened loss of his\ndignity, \"it's a trial, and I'm judge.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the whole ring shouted together. \"We're trying Bultitude,\nsir.\"\n\nOn the whole, perhaps, Mr. Bultitude was glad of this interference. At\nleast justice would be done now, although this usher had blundered so\nunpardonably that morning.\n\n\"This is childish, you know,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, \"and it's not\nfootball. The Doctor will be seriously angry if he comes and sees you\ntrifling here. Let the boy go.\"\n\n\"But he's cheated some of the fellows, sir,\" grumbled Tipping and\nSiggers together.\n\n\"Well, _you_'ve no right to punish him if he has. Leave him to me.\"\n\n\"Will you see fair play between them, sir? He oughtn't to be let off\nwithout being made to keep his word.\"\n\n\"If there is any dispute between you and Bultitude,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn,\n\"I have no objection to settle it--provided it is within my province.\"\n\n\"Settle it without me,\" said Paul hurriedly. \"I've leave to go home. I'm\nill.\"\n\n\"Who gave you leave to go home?\" asked the master.\n\n\"That young man over there on the rails,\" said Paul.\n\n\"I am the proper person to apply to for leave; you know that well\nenough,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, with a certain coldness in his tone. \"Now\nthen, Porter, what is all this business about?\"\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Porter, \"he told me last term he had a lot of\nrabbits at home, and if I liked he would bring me back a lop-eared one\nand let me have it cheap, and I gave him two shillings, sir, and\nsixpence for a hutch to keep it in; and now he pretends he doesn't know\nanything about it!\"\n\nTo Paul's horror two or three other boys came forward with much the same\ntale. He remembered now that during the holidays he had discovered that\nDick was maintaining a sort of amateur menagerie in his bedroom, and\nthat he had ordered the whole of the livestock to be got rid of or\nsummarily destroyed.\n\nNow it seemed that the wretched Dick had already disposed of it to these\nclamorous boys, and, what was worse, had stipulated with considerable\nforethought for payment in advance. For the first time he repented his\npaternal harshness. Like the netted lion, a paltry white mouse or two\nwould have set him free; but, less happy than the beast in the fable, he\nhad not one!\n\nHe tried to stammer out excuses. \"It's extremely unfortunate,\" he said,\n\"but the fact is I'm not in a position to meet this--this sudden call\nupon me. Some other day, perhaps----\"\n\n\"None of your long words, now,\" growled Tipping. (Boys hate long words\nas much as even a Saturday Reviewer.) \"Why haven't you brought the\nrabbits?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn. \"Why, having promised to bring the rabbits\nwith you, haven't you kept your word? You must be able to give some\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Mr. Bultitude, wriggling with embarrassment, \"I--that is\nmy father--found out that my young rascal of a son--I mean his young\nrascal of a son (_me_, you know) was, contrary to my express orders,\nkeeping a couple of abominable rabbits in his bedroom, and a quantity of\nfilthy little white mice which he tried to train to climb up the\nbanisters. And I kept finding the brutes running about my bath-room,\nand--well, of course, I put a stop to it; and--no, what am I saying?--my\nfather, of course, he put a stop to it; and, in point of fact, had them\nall drowned in a pail of water.\"\n\nIt might be thought that he had an excellent opportunity here of avowing\nhimself, but there was the risk that Mr. Blinkhorn would disbelieve him,\nand, with the boys, he felt that the truth would do anything but\nincrease his popularity. But dissembling fails sometimes outside the\ncopy-books, and Mr. Bultitude's rather blundering attempt at it only\nlanded him in worse difficulties.\n\nThere was a yell of rage and disappointment from the defrauded ones, who\nhad cherished a lingering hope that young Bultitude had those rabbits\nsomewhere, but (like Mr. Barkis and his wooden lemon) found himself\nunable to part with them when the time came to fulfil his contract. And\nas contempt is a frame of mind highly stimulating to one's self-esteem,\neven those who had no personal interest in the matter joined in the\nexecrations with hearty goodwill and sympathy.\n\n\"Why did you let him do it? They were ours, not his. What right had your\ngovernor to go and drown our rabbits, eh?\" they cried wrathfully.\n\n\"What right?\" said Paul. \"Mustn't a man do as he pleases in his own\nhouse, then? I--he was not obliged to see the house overrun with vermin,\nI suppose?\"\n\nBut this only made them angrier, and they resented his defence with\nhoots, and groans, and hisses.\n\nMr. Blinkhorn meanwhile was pondering the affair conscientiously. At\nlast he said, \"But you know the Doctor would never allow animals to be\nkept in the school, if Bultitude had brought them. The whole thing is\nagainst the rules, and I shall not interfere.\"\n\n\"Ah, but,\" said Chawner, \"he promised them all to day-boarders. The\nDoctor couldn't object to that, could he, sir?\"\n\n\"True,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, \"true. I was not aware of that. Well then,\nBultitude, since you are prevented from performing what you promised to\ndo, I'm sure you won't object to do what is fair and right in the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"I don't think I quite follow you,\" said Mr. Bultitude. But he dreaded\nwhat was coming next.\n\n\"It's very simple. You have taken money from these boys, and if you\ncan't give them value for it, you ought to return all you took from\nthem. I'm sure you see that yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't admit that I owe them anything,\" said Paul; \"and at all events\nit is highly inconvenient to pay them now.\"\n\n\"If your own sense of honour isn't enough,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, \"I must\ntake the matter into my own hands. Let every boy who has any claim upon\nhim tell me exactly what it is.\"\n\nOne boy after another brought forward his claim. One had entrusted Dick,\nit appeared, with a shilling, for which he was to receive a mouse with a\n\"plum saddle,\" and two others had invested ninepence each in white mice.\nWith Porter's half-crown, the total came to precisely five\nshillings--all Paul had in the world, the one rope by which he could\never hope to haul himself up to his lost pinnacle!\n\nMr. Blinkhorn, naturally enough, saw no reason why the money, being\nclearly due, should not be paid at once. \"Give me any money you have\nabout you, Bultitude,\" he said, \"and I'll satisfy your debts with it, as\nfar as it goes.\"\n\nPaul clasped his arm convulsively. \"No!\" he cried hoarsely, \"not that!\nDon't make me do that! I--I can't pay them--not now. They don't\nunderstand. If they only give me time they shall have double their money\nback--waggon-loads of rabbits, the best rabbits money can buy--if\nthey'll wait. Tell them to wait. My dear sir, don't see me wronged! I\nwon't pay now!\"\n\n\"They have waited long enough,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn; \"you must pay them.\"\n\n\"I tell you I won't!\" cried Paul; \"do you hear? Not one sixpence. Oh, if\nyou knew! That infernal GarudÃ¢ Stone! What fools people are!\"\n\nThen in his despair he did the most fatal thing possible. He tried to\nsave himself by flight, and with a violent plunge broke through the\ncircle and made for the road which led towards the station.\n\nInstantly the whole school, only too glad of the excitement, was at his\nheels. The unhappy Colonial Produce merchant ran as he had not run for a\nquarter of a century, faster even than he had on his first experience of\nCoggs' and Coker's society on that memorable Monday night. But in spite\nof his efforts the chase was a short one. Chawner and Tipping very soon\nhad him by the collar, and brought him back, struggling and kicking out\nviciously, to Mr. Blinkhorn, whose good opinion he had now lost for\never.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Chawner, \"I can feel something like a purse in his\npocket. Shall I take it out, sir?\"\n\n\"As he refuses to act with common honesty--yes,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn.\n\nIt was Dick's purse, of course; and in spite of Paul's frantic efforts\nto retain it, it was taken from him, its contents equitably divided\namongst the claimants, and the purse itself returned to him--empty.\n\n\"Now, Bultitude,\" said Mr. Blinkhorn, \"if you really wish to leave the\nfield, you may.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude lost what little temper he had yet to lose; he flung the\nuseless purse from him and broke away from them all in a condition\nlittle removed from insanity.\n\nLeave the field! What a mockery the permission was now. How was he to\nget home, a distance of more than fifty miles, without a penny in his\npocket? Ten minutes before, and freedom was within his grasp, and now it\nhad eluded him and was as hopelessly out of reach as ever!\n\nNo one pitied him; no one understood the real extent of his loss. Mr.\nBlinkhorn and the few enthusiasts went back to their unobtrusive game,\nwhile the rest of the school discussed the affair in groups, the popular\nindignation against young Bultitude's hitherto unsuspected meanness\ngrowing more marked every instant.\n\nIt might have even taken some decided and objectionable form before\nlong, but when it was at its height there was a sudden cry of alarm.\n\"_Cave_, you fellows, here's Grim!\" and indeed in the far distance the\nDoctor's portly and imposing figure could be seen just turning the\ncorner into the field.\n\nMr. Bultitude felt almost cheered. This coming to join his pupils'\nsports showed a good heart; the Doctor would almost certainly be in a\ngood humour, and he cheated himself into believing that, at some\ninterval in the game, he might perhaps find courage to draw near and\nseek to interest him in his incredible woes.\n\nIt was quite extraordinary to see how the game, which had hitherto\ndecidedly languished and hung fire, now quickened into briskness and\nbecame positively spirited. Everyone developed a hearty interest in it,\nand it would almost seem as if the boys, with more delicacy than they\nare generally credited with, were unwilling to let their master guess\nhow little his indulgence was really appreciated. Even Mr. Tinkler,\nwhose novel had kept him spell-bound on his rail all through the recent\nexcitement, now slipped it hurriedly into his pocket and rushed\nenergetically into the fray, shouting encouragement rather\nindiscriminately to either side, till he had an opportunity of finding\nout privately to which leader he had been assigned.\n\nDr. Grimstone came down the field at a majestic slow trot, calling out\nto the players as he came on--\"Well done, Mutlow! Finely played, sir!\nDribble it along now. Ah, you're afraid of it! Run into it, sir, run\ninto it! No running with the ball now, Siggers; play without those petty\nmeannesses, or leave the game! There, leave the ball to me, will\nyou--leave it to me!\"\n\nAnd, as the ball had rolled in his direction, he punted it up in an\nexceedingly dignified manner, the whole school keeping respectfully\napart, until he had brought it to a reasonable distance from the goal,\nwhen he kicked it through with great solemnity, amidst faint, and it is\nto be feared somewhat sycophantic applause, and turned away with the air\nof a man surfeited of success.\n\n\"For which side did I win that?\" he asked presently, whereupon Tipping\nexplained that his side had been the favoured one. \"Well then,\" he said,\n\"you fellows must all back me up, or I shall not play for you any more;\"\nand he kicked off the ball for the next game.\n\nIt was noticeable that the party thus distinguished did not seem\nprecisely overwhelmed with pleasure at the compliment, which, as they\nknew from experience, implied considerable exertion on their part, and\neven disgrace if they were unsuccessful.\n\nThe other side too looked unhappy, feeling themselves in a position of\nextreme delicacy and embarrassment. For if they played their best, they\nran some risk of offending the Doctor, or, what was worse, drawing him\nover into their ranks; while if, on the other hand, they allowed\nthemselves to be too easily worsted, they might be suspected of\nsulkiness and temper--offences which he was very ready to discover and\nresent.\n\nDr. Grimstone for his part enjoyed the exercise, and had no idea that he\nwas not a thoroughly welcome and valued playmate. But though it was\npleasant to outsiders to see a schoolmaster permitting himself to share\nin the recreation of his pupils, it must be owned that to the latter the\nadvantages of the arrangement seemed something more than dubious.\n\nMr. Bultitude, being on the side adopted by the Doctor, found too soon\nthat he was expected to bestir himself. More than ever anxious now to\nconciliate, he did his very best to conquer his natural repugnance and\nappear more interested than alarmed as the ball came in his way; but\nalthough (in boating slang) he \"sugared\" with some adroitness, he was\npromptly found out, for his son had been a dashing and plucky player.\n\nIt was bitter for him to run meekly about while scathing sarcasms and\ncomments on his want of courage were being hurled at his head. It\nshattered the scanty remnants of his self-respect, but he dared not\nprotest or say a single word to open the Doctor's eyes to the injustice\nhe was doing him.\n\nHe was unpleasantly reminded, too, of the disfavour he had acquired\namongst his companions, by some one or other of them running up to him\nevery moment when the Doctor's attention was called elsewhere, and\nstartling his nerves by a sly jog or pinch, or an abusive epithet hissed\nviciously into his ears--Chawner being especially industrious in this\nrespect.\n\nAnd in this unsatisfactory way the afternoon dragged along until the\ndusk gathered and the lamps were lighted, and it became too dark to see\ngoal-posts or ball.\n\nBy the time play was stopped and the school reformed for the march home,\nMr. Bultitude felt that he was glad even to get back to labour as a\nrelief from such a form of enjoyment. It was perhaps the most miserable\nafternoon he had ever spent in his whole easy-going life. In the course\nof it he had passed from brightest hope to utter despair; and now\nnothing remained to him but to convince the Doctor, which he felt quite\nunequal to do, or to make his escape without money--which would\ninevitably end in a recapture.\n\nMay no one who reads this ever be placed upon the horns of such a\ndilemma!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. _A Letter from Home_\n\n     \"Here are a few of the unpleasantest words\n     That ever blotted paper....\n                                A letter,\n     And every word in it a gaping wound.\"\n                                    _Merchant of Venice._\n\n\nIf it were not that it was so absolutely essential to the interest of\nthis story, I think I should almost prefer to draw a veil over the\nsufferings of Mr. Bultitude during the rest of that unhappy week at\nCrichton House; but it would only be false delicacy to do so.\n\nThings went worse and worse with him. The real Dick in his most\nobjectionable moods could never have contrived to render himself one\nquarter so disliked and suspected as his substitute was by the whole\nschool--masters and boys.\n\nIt was in a great measure his own fault, too; for to an ordinary boy the\nlife there would not have had any intolerable hardships, if it held out\nno exceptional attractions. But he would not accommodate himself to\ncircumstances, and try, during his enforced stay, to get as much\ninstruction and enjoyment as possible out of his new life.\n\nPerhaps, in his position, it would be too much to expect such a thing\nand, at all events, it never even occurred to him to attempt it. He\nconsumed himself instead with inward raging and chafing at his hard lot,\nand his utter powerlessness to break the spell which bound him.\n\nSometimes, indeed, he would resolve to bear it no longer, and would\nstart up impulsively to impart his misfortunes to some one in minor\nauthority--not the Doctor, he had given that up in resigned despair long\nsince. But as surely as ever he found himself coming to the point, the\nwords would stick fast in his throat, and he was only too thankful to\nget away, with his tale untold, on any frivolous pretext that first\nsuggested itself.\n\nThis, of course, brought him into suspicion, for such conduct had the\nappearance of a systematic course of practical joking, and even the most\nimpartial teachers will sometimes form an unfavourable opinion of a\nparticular boy on rather slender grounds, and then find fresh\nconfirmation of it in his most insignificant actions.\n\nAs for the school generally, his scowls and his sullenness, his\ndeficiency in the daring and impudence that had warmed their hearts\ntowards Dick, and, above all, his strange knack of getting them into\ntrouble--for he seldom received what he considered an indignity without\nmaking a formal complaint--all this brought him as much hearty dislike\nand contempt as, perhaps, the most unsympathetic boy ever earned since\nboarding-schools were first invented.\n\nThe only boy who still seemed to retain a secret tenderness for him, as\nthe Dick he had once looked up to and admired, was Jolland, who\npersisted in believing, and in stating his belief, that this apparent\nchange of demeanour was a perverted kind of joke on Bultitude's part,\nwhich he would condescend to explain some day when it had gone far\nenough, and he wearied and annoyed Paul beyond endurance by perpetually\nurging him to abandon his ill-judged experiment and discover the point\nof the jest.\n\nBut for Jolland's help, which he persevered in giving in spite of the\nopposition and unpopularity it brought upon himself, Mr. Bultitude would\nhave found it impossible to make any pretence of performing the tasks\nrequired of him.\n\nHe found himself expected, as a matter of course, to have a certain\nfamiliarity with Greek paradigms and German conversation scraps,\npropositions in Euclid and Latin gerunds, of all of which, having had a\nstrict commercial education in his young days, he had not so much as\nheard before his metamorphosis. But by carefully copying Jolland's\nexercises, and introducing enough mistakes of his own to supply the\nnecessary local colour, he was able to escape to a great degree the\ndiscovery of his blank ignorance on all these subjects--an ignorance\nwhich would certainly have been put down as mere idleness and obstinacy.\n\nBut it will be readily believed that he lived in constant fear of such\ndiscovery, and as it was, his dependence on a little scamp like his\nson's friend was a sore humiliation to one who had naturally supposed\nhitherto that any knowledge he had not happened to acquire could only be\nmeretricious and useless.\n\nHe led a nightmare sort of existence for some days, until something\nhappened which roused him from his state of passive misery into one more\nattempt at protest.\n\nIt was Saturday morning, and he had come down to breakfast, after being\nknocked about as usual in the dormitory over night, with a dull wonder\nhow long this horrible state of things could possibly be going to last,\nwhen he saw on his plate a letter with the Paddington post-mark,\naddressed in a familiar hand--his daughter Barbara's.\n\nFor an instant his hopes rose high. Surely the impostor had been found\nout at last, and the envelope would contain an urgent invitation to him\nto come back and resume his rights--an invitation which he might show to\nthe Doctor as his best apology.\n\nBut when he looked at the address, which was \"Master Richard Bultitude,\"\nhe felt a misgiving. It was unlikely that Barbara would address him thus\nif she knew the truth; he hesitated before tearing it open.\n\nThen he tried to persuade himself that of course she would have the\nsense to keep up appearances for his own sake on the outside of the\nletter, and he compelled himself to open the envelope with fingers that\ntrembled nervously.\n\nThe very first sentences scattered his faint expectations to the winds.\nHe read on with staring eyes, till the room seemed to rock with him like\na packet-boat and the sprawling school-girl handwriting, crossed and\nrecrossed on the thin paper, changed to letters of scorching flame. But\nperhaps it will be better to give the letter in full, so that the reader\nmay judge for himself whether it was calculated or not to soothe and\nencourage the exiled one.\n\nHere it is:\n\n\n     \"MY DEAREST DARLING DICK,--I hope you have not been expecting a\n     letter from me before this, but I had such lots to tell you that I\n     waited till I had time to tell it all at once. For I have such news\n     for you! You can't think how pleased you will be when you hear it.\n     Where shall I begin? I hardly know, for it still seems so funny and\n     strange--almost like a dream--only I hope we shall never wake up.\n\n     \"I think I must tell you anyhow, just as it comes. Well, ever since\n     you went away, dear Father has been completely changed; you would\n     hardly believe it unless you saw him. He is quite jolly and\n     boyish--only fancy! and we are always telling him he is the biggest\n     baby of us all, but it only makes him laugh. Once, you know, he\n     would have been awfully angry if we had even hinted at it.\n\n     \"Do you know, I really think that the real reason he was so cross\n     and sharp with us that last week was because you were going away;\n     for now the wrench of parting is over, he is quite light-hearted\n     again. You know how he always hates showing his feelings.\n\n     \"He is so altered now, you can't think. He has actually only once\n     been up to the city since you left, and then he came home at four\n     o'clock, and he seems to quite like to have us all about him.\n     Generally he stays at home all the morning and plays at soldiers\n     with baby in the dining-room. You would laugh to see him loading\n     the cannons with real powder and shot, and he didn't care a bit\n     when some of it made holes in the sideboard and smashed the\n     looking-glass.\n\n     \"We had such fun the other afternoon; we played at brigands--papa\n     and all of us. Papa had the upper conservatory for a robber-cave,\n     and stood there keeping guard with your pop-gun; and he wouldn't\n     let the servants go by without a kiss, unless they showed a written\n     pass from us! Miss McFadden called in the middle of it, but she\n     said she wouldn't come in, as papa seemed to be enjoying himself\n     so. Boaler has given warning, but we can't think why. We have been\n     out nearly every evening--once to Hengler's and once to the Christy\n     Minstrels, and last night to the Pantomime, where papa was so\n     pleased with the clown that he sent round afterwards and asked him\n     to dine here on Sunday, when Sir Benjamin and Lady Bangle and\n     Alderman Fishwick are coming. Won't it be jolly to see a clown\n     close to? Should you think he'd come in _his_ evening dress? Miss\n     Mangnall has been given a month's holiday, because papa didn't like\n     to see us always at lessons. Think of that!\n\n     \"We are going to have the whole house done up and refurnished at\n     last. Papa chose the furniture for the drawing-room yesterday. It\n     is all in yellow satin, which is rather bright, I think. I haven't\n     seen the carpet yet, but it is to match the furniture; and there is\n     a lovely hearthrug, with a lion-hunt worked on it.\n\n     \"But that isn't the best of it; we are going to have the big\n     children's party after all! No one but children invited, and\n     everyone to do exactly what they like. I wanted so much to have you\n     home for it, but papa says it would only unsettle you and take you\n     away from your work.\n\n     \"Had Dulcie forgotten you? I should like to see her so much. Now I\n     really must leave off, as I am going to the Aquarium with papa.\n     Mind you write me as good a letter as this is, if that old Doctor\n     lets you. Minnie and Roly send love and kisses, and papa sends his\n     kind regards, and I am to say he hopes you are settling down\n     steadily to work.\n\n                              \"With best love, your affectionate sister,\n                                              \"BARBARA BULTITUDE.\"\n\n     \"P.S.--I nearly forgot to say that Uncle Duke came the other day\n     and has stayed here ever since. He is going to make papa's fortune!\n     I believe by a gold mine he knows about somewhere, and a steam\n     tramway in Lapland. But I don't like him very much--he is so\n     polite.\"\n\n\nIt would be nothing short of an insult to the reader's comprehension, if\nI were to enter into an elaborate explanation of the effect this letter\nhad upon Mr. Bultitude. He took it in by degrees, trying to steady his\nnerves at each additional item of poor Barbara's well-meant intelligence\nby a sip at his tin-flavoured coffee. But when he came to the\npostscript, in spite of its purport being mercifully broken to him\ngradually by the extreme difficulty of making it out from two\nundercurrents of manuscript, he choked convulsively and spilt his\ncoffee.\n\nDr. Grimstone visited this breach of etiquette with stern promptness.\n\"This conduct at table is disgraceful, sir--perfectly\ndisgraceful--unworthy of a civilised being. I have been a teacher of\nyouth for many years, and never till now did I have the pain of seeing a\npupil of mine choke in his breakfast-cup with such deplorable\nill-breeding. It's pure greediness, sir, and you will have the goodness\nto curb your indecent haste in consuming your food for the future. Your\nexcellent father has frequently complained to me, with tears in his\neyes, of the impossibility of teaching you to behave at meals with\ncommon propriety!\"\n\nThere was a faint chuckle along the tables, and several drank coffee\nwith studied elegance and self-repression either as a valuable example\nto Dick, or as a personal advertisement. But Paul was in no mood for\nreproof and instruction. He stood up in his excitement, flourishing his\nletter wildly.\n\n\"Dr. Grimstone!\" he said; \"never mind my behaviour now. I've something\nto tell you. I can't bear it any longer. I must go home at once--at\nonce, sir!\"\n\nThere was a general sensation at this, for his manner was peremptory and\nalmost dictatorial. Some thought he would get a licking on the strength\nof it, and most hoped so. But the Doctor dismissed them to the\nplayground, keeping Paul back to be dealt with in privacy.\n\nMrs. Grimstone played nervously with her dry toast at the end of the\ntable, for she could not endure to see the boys in trouble and dreaded a\nscene, while Dulcie looked on with wide bright eyes.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said the Doctor, looking up from his marmalade, \"why must\nyou go home at once?\"\n\n\"I've just had a letter,\" stammered Paul.\n\n\"No one ill at home, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Paul. \"It's not that; it's worse! She doesn't know what\nhorrible things she tells me!\"\n\n\"Who is 'she'?\" said the Doctor--and Dulcie's eyes were larger still and\nher face paled.\n\n\"I decline to say,\" said Mr. Bultitude. It would have been absurd to say\n'my daughter,' and he had not presence of mind just then to transpose\nthe relationships with neatness and success. \"But indeed I am wanted\nmost badly!\"\n\n\"What are you wanted for, pray?\"\n\n\"Everything!\" declared Paul; \"it's all going to rack and ruin without\nme!\"\n\n\"That's absurd,\" said the Doctor; \"you're not such an important\nindividual as all that, Bultitude. But let me see the letter.\"\n\nShow him the letter--lay bare all those follies of Dick's, the burden\nof which he might have to bear himself very shortly--never! Besides,\nwhat would be the use of it? It would be no argument in favour of\nsending him home--rather the reverse--so Paul was obliged to say,\n\"Excuse me, Dr. Grimstone, it is--ah--of a private nature. I don't feel\nat liberty to show it to anyone.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said the Doctor, with some reason, \"if you can't tell me\nwho or what it is that requires your presence at home, and decline to\nshow me the letter which would presumably give me some idea on the\nsubject, how do you expect that I am to listen to such a preposterous\ndemand--eh? Just tell me that!\"\n\nOnce more would Paul have given worlds for the firmness and presence of\nmind to state his case clearly and effectively; and he could hardly have\nhad a better opportunity, for schoolmasters cannot always be playing the\ntyrant, and the Doctor was, in spite of his attempts to be stern,\nsecretly more amused than angry at what seemed a peculiarly precocious\npiece of effrontery.\n\nBut Paul felt the dismal absurdity of his position. Nothing he had said,\nnothing he could say, short of the truth, would avail him, and the truth\nwas precisely what he felt most unable to tell. He hung his head\nresignedly, and held his tongue in confusion.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the Doctor at last; \"let me have no more of this\ntomfoolery, Bultitude. It's getting to be a positive nuisance. Don't\ncome to me with any more of these ridiculous stories, or some day I\nshall be annoyed. There, go away, and be contented where you are, and\ntry to behave like other people.\"\n\n\"'Contented!'\" muttered Paul, when out of hearing, as he went upstairs\nand through the empty schoolroom into the playground. \"'Behave like\nother people!' Ah, yes, I suppose I shall have to come to that in time.\nBut that letter---- Everything upside down---- Bangle asked to meet a\ncommon clown! That fellow Duke letting me in for gold-mines and\ntramways! It's all worse than I ever dreamed of; and I must stay here\nand be 'contented!' It's--it's perfectly damnable!\"\n\nAll through that morning his thoughts ran in the same doleful groove,\nuntil the time for work came to an end, and he found himself in the\nplayground, and free to indulge his melancholy for a few minutes in\nsolitude; for the others were still loitering about in the schoolroom,\nand a glass outhouse originally intended for a conservatory, but now\ndevoted to boots and slates, and the books liberally besmeared with\ngilt, and telling of the exploits of boy-heroes so beloved of boys.\n\nMr. Bultitude, only too delighted to get away from them for a little\nwhile, was leaning against the parallel bars in dull despondency, when\nhe heard a rustling in the laurel hedge which cut off the house garden\nfrom the gravelled playground, and looking up, saw Dulcie slip through\nthe shrubs and come towards him with an air of determination in her\nproud little face.\n\nShe looked prettier and daintier than ever in her grey hat and warm fur\ntippet; but of course Paul was not of the age or in the mood to be much\naffected by such things--he turned his head pettishly away.\n\n\"It's no use doing that, Dick,\" she said: \"I'm tired of sulking. I\nshan't sulk any more till I have an explanation.\"\n\nPaul made the sound generally written \"Pshaw!\"\n\n\"You ought to tell me everything. I will know it. Oh, Dick, you might\ntell me! I always told you anything you wanted to know; and I let mamma\nthink it was I broke the clock-shade last term, and you know you did it.\nAnd I want to know something so very badly!\"\n\n\"It's no use coming to _me_, you know,\" said Paul. \"I can't do anything\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can; you know you can!\" said Dulcie impulsively. \"You can tell\nme what was in that letter you had at breakfast--and you shall too!\"\n\n\"What an inquisitive little girl you are,\" said Paul sententiously.\n\"It's not nice for little girls to be so inquisitive--it doesn't look\nwell.\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" cried Dulcie; \"you don't want to tell me--because--because\nit's from that other horrid girl you like better than me. And you\npromised to belong to me for ever and ever, and now it's all over! Say\nit isn't! Oh, Dick, promise to give the other girl up. I'm sure she's\nnot a nice girl. She's written you an unkind letter; now hasn't she?\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Paul, \"this is very forward; at your age too. Why,\nmy Barbara----\"\n\n\"Your Barbara! you dare to call her that? Oh, I knew I was right; I\n_will_ see that letter now. Give it me this instant!\" said Dulcie\nimperiously; and Paul really felt almost afraid of her.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, retreating a step or two, \"it's all a mistake;\nthere's nothing to get into such a passion about--there isn't indeed!\nAnd--don't cry--you're really a pretty little girl. I only wish I could\ntell you everything; but you'd never believe me!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I would, Dick!\" protested Dulcie, only too willing to be\nconvinced of her boy-lover's constancy; \"I'll believe anything, if\nyou'll only tell me. And I'm sorry I was so angry. Sit down by me and\ntell me from the very beginning. I promise not to interrupt.\"\n\nPaul thought for a moment. After all, why shouldn't he? It was much\npleasanter to tell his sorrows to her little ear and hear her childish\nwonder and pity than face her terrible father--he had tried that. And\nthen she might tell her mother; and so his story might reach the\nDoctor's ears after all, without further effort on his part.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"I think you're a good-natured little girl; you\nwon't laugh. Perhaps I will tell you!\"\n\nSo he sat down on the bench by the wall, and Dulcie, quite happy again\nnow at this proof of good faith, nestled up against him confidingly,\nwaiting for his first words with parted lips and eager sparkling eyes.\n\n\"Not many days ago,\" began Paul, \"I was somebody very different\nfrom----\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said a jarring, sneering voice close by; \"was you?\" And he\nlooked up and saw Tipping standing over him with a plainly hostile\nintent.\n\n\"Go away, Tipping,\" said Dulcie; \"we don't want you. Dick is telling me\na secret.\"\n\n\"He's very fond of telling, I know,\" retorted Tipping. \"If you knew what\na sneak he was you'd have nothing to do with him, Dulcie. I could tell\nyou things about him that----\"\n\n\"He's not a sneak,\" said Dulcie. \"Are you, Dick? Why don't you go,\nTipping. Never mind what he says, Dick; go on as if he wasn't there. I\ndon't care what he says!\"\n\nIt was a most unpleasant situation for Mr. Bultitude, but he did not\nlike to offend Tipping. \"I--I think--some other time, perhaps,\" he said\nnervously. \"Not now.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're afraid to say what you were going to say now I'm here,\" said\nthe amiable Tipping, nettled by Dulcie's little air of haughty disdain.\n\"You're a coward; you know you are. You pretend to think such a lot of\nDulcie here, but you daren't fight!\"\n\n\"Fight!\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"Eh, what for?\"\n\n\"Why, for her, of course. You can't care much about her if you daren't\nfight for her. I want to show her who's the best man of the two!\"\n\n\"I don't want to be shown,\" wailed poor Dulcie piteously, clinging to\nthe reluctant Paul; \"I know. Don't fight with him, Dick. I say you're\nnot to.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Mr. Bultitude with great decision. \"I shouldn't\nthink of such a thing!\" and he rose from the bench and was about to walk\naway, when Tipping suddenly pulled off his coat and began to make sundry\ndemonstrations of a martial nature, such as dancing aggressively towards\nhis rival and clenching his fists.\n\nBy this time most of the other boys had come down into the playground,\nand were looking on with great interest. There was an element of romance\nin this promised combat which gave it additional attractions. It was\nlike one of the struggles between knightly champions in the Waverley\nnovels. Several of them would have fought till they couldn't see out of\ntheir eyes if it would have given them the least chance of obtaining\nfavour in Dulcie's sight, and they all envied Dick, who was the only boy\nthat was not unmercifully snubbed by their capricious little princess.\n\nPaul alone was blind to the splendour of his privileges. He examined\nTipping carefully, as the latter was still assuming a hostile attitude\nand chanting a sort of war-cry supposed to be an infallible incentive to\nstrife.\n\n\"Yah, you're afraid!\" he sang very offensively. \"I wouldn't be a funk!\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Paul at last; \"go away, sir, go away!\"\n\n\"Go away, eh?\" jeered Tipping. \"Who are you to tell me to go away? Go\naway yourself!\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Paul, only too happy to oblige. But he found himself\nprevented by a ring of excited backers.\n\n\"Don't funk it, Dick!\" cried some, forgetting recent ill-feeling in the\nnecessity for partisanship. \"Go in and settle him as you did that last\ntime. I'll second you. You can do it!\"\n\n\"Don't hit each other in the face,\" pleaded Dulcie, who had got upon a\nbench and was looking down into the ring--not, if the truth must be\ntold, without a certain pleasurable excitement in the feeling that it\nwas all about her.\n\nAnd now Mr. Bultitude discovered that he was seriously expected to fight\nthis great hulking boy, and that the sole reason for any disagreement\nwas an utterly unfounded jealousy respecting this little girl Dulcie. He\nhad not a grain of chivalry in his disposition--chivalry being an\neminently unpractical virtue--and naturally he saw no advantage in\nletting himself be mauled for the sake of a child younger than his own\ndaughter.\n\nDulcie's appeal enraged Tipping, who took it as addressed solely to\nhimself. \"You ought to be glad to stick up for her,\" he said between his\nteeth. \"I'll mash you for this--see if I don't!\"\n\nPaul thought he saw his way clear to disabuse Tipping of his mistaken\nidea. \"Are you proposing,\" he asked politely, \"to--to 'mash' me on\naccount of that little girl there on the seat?\"\n\n\"You'll soon see,\" growled Tipping. \"Shut your head, and come on!\"\n\n\"No, but I want to know,\" persisted Mr. Bultitude. \"Because,\" he said\nwith a sickly attempt at jocularity which delighted none, \"you see, I\ndon't want to be mashed. I'm not a potato. If I understand you aright,\nyou want to fight me because you think me likely to interfere with your\nclaim to that little girl's--ah--affections?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Tipping gruffly; \"so you'd better waste no more words\nabout it, and come on.\"\n\n\"But I don't care about coming on,\" protested Paul earnestly. \"It's all\na mistake. I've no doubt she's a very nice little girl, but I assure\nyou, my good boy, I've no desire to stand in your way for one instant.\nShe's nothing to me--nothing at all! I give her up to you. Take her,\nyoung fellow, with my blessing! There, now, that's all settled\ncomfortably--eh?\"\n\nHe was just looking round with a self-satisfied and relieved air, when\nhe began to be aware that his act of frank unselfishness was not as much\nappreciated as it deserved. Tipping, indeed, looked baffled and\nirresolute for one moment, but a low murmur of disgust arose from the\nbystanders, and even Jolland declared that it was \"too beastly mean.\"\n\nAs for Dulcie, she had been looking on incredulously at her champion's\nunaccountable tardiness in coming to the point. But this public\nrepudiation was too much for her. She gave a little low wail as she\nheard the shameless words of recantation, and then, without a word,\njumped lightly down from her bench and ran away to hide herself\nsomewhere and cry.\n\nEven Paul, though he knew that he had done nothing but what was strictly\nright, and had acted purely in self-protection, felt unaccountably\nashamed of himself as he saw this effect of his speech. But it was too\nlate now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. _The Complete Letter-Writer_\n\n     \"Accelerated by ignominious shovings--nay, as it is written, by\n     smitings, twitchings, spurnings _Ã  posteriori_ not to be\n     named.\"                                     --_French Revolution._\n\n     \"This letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in\n     the youth.\"--_Twelfth Night._\n\n\nMr. Bultitude had meant to achieve a double stroke of diplomacy--to\nundeceive Dulcie and conciliate the lovesick Tipping. But whatever his\nsuccess may have been in the former respect, the latter object failed\nconspicuously.\n\n\"You shan't get off by a shabby trick like that,\" said Tipping,\nexasperated by the sight of Dulcie's emotion; \"you've made her cry now,\nand you shall smart for it. So, now, are you going to stand up to me\nlike a man, or will you take a licking?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to help you to commit a breach of the peace,\" said Paul\nwith great dignity. \"Go away, you quarrelsome young ruffian! Get one of\nyour schoolfellows to fight you, if you must fight. I don't want to be\nmixed up with you in any way.\"\n\nBut at this Tipping, whose blood was evidently at boiling point, came\nprancing down on him in a Zulu-like fashion, swinging his long arms like\na windmill, and finding that his enemy made no attempt at receiving him,\nbut only moved away apprehensively, he seized him by the collar as a\nprelude to dealing him a series of kicks behind.\n\nAlthough Mr. Bultitude, as we have seen, was opposed to fighting as a\nsystem he could not submit to this sort of thing without at least some\nattempt to defend himself; and judging it of the highest importance to\ndisable his adversary in the most effectual manner before the latter had\ntime to carry out his offensive designs, he turned sharply round and hit\nhim a very severe blow in the lower part of his waistcoat.\n\nThe result fulfilled his highest expectations. Tipping collapsed like a\npocket-rule, and staggered away speechless, and purple with pain, while\nPaul stood calm and triumphant. He had shown these fellows that he\nwasn't going to stand any nonsense. They would leave him alone after\nthis, perhaps.\n\nBut once more there were cries and murmurs of \"Shame!\" \"No hitting below\nthe belt!\" \"Cad--coward!\"\n\nIt appeared that, somehow, he had managed to offend their prejudices\neven in this. \"It's very odd,\" he thought; \"when I didn't fight they\ncalled me a coward, and now, when I do, I don't seem to have pleased\nthem much. I don't care, though. I've settled _him_.\"\n\nBut after a season of protracted writhing by the parallel bars, Tipping\ncame out, still gasping and deadly pale, leaning on Biddlecomb's\nshoulder, and was met with universal sympathy and condolence.\n\n\"Thanks!\" he said with considerable effort. \"Of course--I'm not\ngoing--to fight him after a low trick like that; but perhaps you fellows\nwill see that he doesn't escape quite as easily as he fancies?\"\n\nThere was a general shout. \"No; he shall pay for it! We'll teach him to\nfight fair! We'll see if he tries that on again!\"\n\nPaul heard it with much uneasiness. What new devilry were they about to\npractise upon him? He was not left long in doubt.\n\n\"I vote,\" suggested Biddlecomb, as if he were proposing a testimonial,\n\"we make him run the gauntlet. Grim won't come out and catch us. I saw\nhim go out for a drive an hour ago.\" And the idea was very favourably\nentertained.\n\nPaul had heard of \"running the gauntlet,\" and dimly suspected that it\nwas not an experience he was likely to enjoy, particularly when he saw\neveryone busying himself with tying the end of his pocket-handkerchief\ninto a hard knot. He tried in vain to excuse himself, declaring again\nand again that he had never meant to injure the boy. He had only\ndefended himself, and was under the impression that he was at perfect\nliberty to hit him wherever he could, and so on. But they were in no\nmood for excuses.\n\nWith a stern magisterial formality worthy of a Vehm-Gericht, they formed\nin two long lines down the centre of the playground; and while Paul was\nstill staring in wonder at what this strange manoeuvre might mean,\nsomebody pounced upon him and carried him up to one end of the ranks,\nwhere Tipping had by this time sufficiently recovered to be able to \"set\nhim going,\" as he chose to call it, with a fairly effective kick.\n\nAfter that he had a confused sense of flying madly along the double line\nof avengers under a hail of blows which caught him on every part of his\nhead, shoulders, and back till he reached the end, where he was\ndexterously turned and sent spinning up to Tipping again, who in his\nturn headed him back on his arrival, and forced him to brave the\nterrible lane once more.\n\nNever before had Mr. Bultitude felt so sore and insulted. But they kept\nit up long after the thing had lost its first freshness--until at last\nexhaustion made them lean to mercy, and they cuffed him ignominiously\ninto a corner, and left him to lament his ill-treatment there till the\nbell rang for dinner, for which, contrary to precedent, his recent\nviolent exercise had excited little appetite.\n\n\"I shall be killed soon if I stay here,\" he moaned; \"I know I shall.\nThese young brigands would murder me cheerfully, if they were not\nafraid of being caned for it. I'm a miserable man, and I wish I was\ndead!\"\n\nAlthough that afternoon, being Saturday, was a half-holiday, Mr.\nBultitude was spared the ordeal of another game at football; for a smart\nstorm of rain and sleet coming on about three o'clock kept the\nschool--not altogether unwilling prisoners--within doors for the day.\n\nThe boys sat in their places in their schoolroom, amusing themselves\nafter their several fashions--some reading, some making libellous copies\nof drawings that took their fancy in the illustrated papers, some\nplaying games; others, too listless to play and too dull to find\npleasure in the simplest books, filled up the time as well as they could\nby quarrelling and getting into various depths of hot water. Paul sat in\na corner pretending to read a story relating the experiences of certain\ninfants of phenomenal courage and coolness in the Arctic regions. They\nkilled bears and tamed walruses all through the book; but for the first\ntime, perhaps, since their appearance in print their exploits fell flat.\nNot, however, that this reflected any discredit upon the author's\npowers, which are justly admired by all healthy-minded boys; but it was\nbeyond the power of literature just then to charm Mr. Bultitude's\nthoughts from the recollection of his misfortunes.\n\nAs he took in all the details of his surroundings--the warm close room;\nthe raw-toned desks and tables at which a rabble of unsympathetic boys\nwere noisily whispering and chattering, with occasional glances in his\ndirection, from which, taught by experience, he augured no good; the\nhigh uncurtained windows, blurred with little stars of half-frozen rain,\nand the bare, bleak branches of the trees outside tossing drearily\nagainst a low leaden sky--he tried in vain to cheat himself into a\ndreamy persuasion that all this misery could not be real, but would fade\naway as suddenly and mysteriously as it had stolen upon him.\n\nTowards the close of the afternoon the Doctor came in and took his\nplace at the writing-table, where he was apparently very busy with the\ncomposition of some sort of document, which he finished at last with\nevident satisfaction at the result of his labour. Then he observed that,\naccording to their custom of a Saturday afternoon, the hour before\ntea-time should be devoted to \"writing home.\"\n\nSo the books, chess-boards, and dominoes were all put away, and a new\nsteel pen and a sheet of notepaper, neatly embossed with the heading\n\"Crichton House School\" in old English letters, having been served out\nto everyone, each boy prepared himself to write down such things as\nfilial affection, strict truthfulness, and the desire of imparting\ninformation might inspire between them.\n\nPaul felt, as he clutched his writing materials, much as a shipwrecked\nmariner might be expected to do at finding on his desolate island a\ngood-sized flag and a case of rockets. His hopes revived once more; he\nforgot the smarts left by the knots in the handkerchiefs, he had a whole\nhour before him--it was possible to set several wires in motion for his\nrelease in an hour.\n\nYes, he must write several letters. First, one to his solicitor\ndetailing, as calmly and concisely as his feelings would allow, the\nshameful way in which he had been treated, and imploring him to take\nmeasures of some sort for getting him out of his false and awkward\nposition; one to his head clerk, to press upon him the necessity of\nprudence and caution in dealing with the impostor; notes to Bangle and\nFishwick putting them off--they should not be outraged by an\nintroduction to a vulgar pantomime clown under his roof; and lastly\n(this was an outburst he could not deny himself), a solemn impressive\nappeal to the common humanity, if not to the ordinary filial instincts,\nof his undutiful son.\n\nHis fingers tingled to begin. Sentences of burning, indignant eloquence\ncrowded confusedly into his head--he would write such letters as would\ncarry instant conviction to the most practical and matter-of-fact\nminds. The pathos and dignity of his remonstrances should melt even\nDick's selfish, callous heart.\n\nPerhaps he overrated the power of his pen--perhaps it would have\nrequired more than mere ink to persuade his friends to disbelieve their\nown senses, and see a portly citizen of over fifty packed into the frame\nof a chubby urchin of fourteen. But, at all events, no one's faith was\nput to so hard a test--those letters were never written.\n\n\"Don't begin to write yet, any of you,\" said the Doctor; \"I have a few\nwords to say to you first. In most cases, and as a general rule, I think\nit wisest to let every boy commit to paper whatever his feelings may\ndictate to him. I wish to claim no censorship over the style and diction\nof your letters. But there have been so many complaints lately from the\nparents of some of the less advanced of you, that I find myself obliged\nto make a change. Your father particularly, Richard Bultitude,\" he\nadded, turning suddenly upon the unlucky Paul, \"has complained bitterly\nof the slovenly tone and phrasing of your correspondence; he said very\njustly that they would disgrace a stable-boy, and unless I could induce\nyou to improve them, he begged he might not be annoyed by them in\nfuture.\"\n\nIt was by no means the least galling part of Mr. Bultitude's trials,\nthat former forgotten words and deeds of his in his original condition\nwere constantly turning up at critical seasons, and plunging him deeper\ninto the morass just when he saw some prospect of gaining firm ground.\n\nSo, on this occasion, he did remember that, being in a more than usually\nbad temper one day last year, he had, on receiving a sprawling,\nill-spelt application from Dick for more pocket-money, to buy fireworks\nfor the 5th of November, written to make some such complaint to the\nschoolmaster. He waited anxiously for the Doctor's next words; he might\nwant to read the letters before they were sent off, in which case Paul\nwould not be displeased, for it would be an easier and less dangerous\nway of putting the Doctor in possession of the facts.\n\nBut his complaints were to be honoured by a much more effectual remedy,\nfor it naturally piqued the Doctor to be told that boys instructed under\nhis auspices wrote like stable-boys. \"However,\" he went on, \"I wish your\npeople at home to be assured from time to time of your welfare, and to\nprevent them from being shocked and distressed in future by the crudity\nof your communications, I have drawn up a short form of letter for the\nuse of the lower boys in the second form--which I shall now proceed to\ndictate. Of course all boys in the first form, and all in the second\nabove Bultitude and Jolland, will write as they please, as usual.\nRichard, I expect you to take particular pains to write this out neatly.\nAre you all ready? Very well then, ... now;\" and he read out the\nfollowing letter, slowly--\n\n\"My dear Parents (or parent according to circumstances) comma\" (all of\nwhich several took down most industriously)--\"You will be rejoiced to\nhear that, having arrived with safety at our destination, we have by\nthis time fully resumed our customary regular round of earnest work\nrelieved and sweetened by hearty play. ('Have you all got \"hearty play\"\ndown?'\" inquired the Doctor rather suspiciously, while Jolland observed\nin an undertone that it would take some time to get _that_ down.) \"I\nhope, I trust I may say without undue conceit, to have made considerable\nprogress in my school-tasks before I rejoin the family circle for the\nEaster vacation, as I think you will admit when I inform you of the\nprogramme we intend\" ('D.V. in brackets and capital letters'--as before,\nthis was taken down verbatim by Jolland, who probably knew very much\nbetter), \"intend to work out during the term.\n\n\"In Latin, the class of which I am a member propose to thoroughly master\nthe first book of Virgil's magnificent Epic, need I say I refer to the\nsoul-moving story of the Pious Ãneas?\" (Jolland was understood by his\nnear neighbours to remark that he thought the explanation distinctly\nadvisable), \"whilst, in Greek, we have already commenced the thrilling\naccount of the 'Anabasis' of Xenophon, that master of strategy! nor\nshall we, of course, neglect in either branch of study the syntax and\nconstruction of those two noble languages\"--(\"noble languages,\" echoed\nthe writers mechanically, contriving to insinuate a touch of irony into\nthe words).\n\n\"In German under the able tutelage of Herr Stohwasser, who, as I may\npossibly have mentioned to you in casual conversation, is a graduate of\nthe University of Heidelberg\" (\"and a silly old hass,\" added Jolland\nparenthetically), \"we have resigned ourselves to the spell of the\nTeutonian Shakespeare\" (there was much difference of opinion as to the\nmanner of spelling the \"Teutonian Shakespeare\"), \"as, in my opinion,\nSchiller may be not inaptly termed, and our French studies comprise such\nexercises, and short poems and tales, as are best calculated to afford\nan insight into the intricacies of the Gallic tongue.\n\n\"But I would not have you imagine, my dear parents (or parent, as\nbefore), that, because the claims of the intellect have been thus amply\nprovided for, the requirements of the body are necessarily overlooked!\n\n\"I have no intention of becoming a mere bookworm, and, on the contrary,\nwe have had one excessively brisk and pleasant game at football already\nthis season, and should, but for the unfortunate inclemency of the\nweather, have engaged again this afternoon in the mimic warfare.\n\n\"In the playground our favourite diversion is the game of 'chevy,' so\ncalled from the engagement famed in ballad and history (I allude to the\nbattle of Chevy Chase), and indeed, my dear parents, in the rapid\nalternations of its fortunes and the diversity of its incident, the game\n(to my mind) bears a striking resemblance to the accounts of that\never-memorable contest.\n\n\"I fear I must now relinquish my pen, as the time allotted for\ncorrespondence is fast waning to its close, and tea-time is approaching.\nPray give my kindest remembrance to all my numerous friends and\nrelatives, and accept my fondest love and affection for yourselves, and\nthe various other members of the family circle.\n\n\"I am, I am rejoiced to say, in the enjoyment of excellent health, and\nsurrounded as I am by congenial companions, and employed in interesting\nand agreeable pursuits, it is superfluous to add that I am happy.\n\n\"And now, my dear parents, believe me, your dutiful and affectionate\nson, so and so.\"\n\nThe Doctor finished his dictation with a roll in his voice, as much as\nto say, \"I think that will strike your respective parents as a chaste\nand classical composition; I think so!\"\n\nBut unexceptionable as its tone and sentiments undoubtedly were, it was\nfar from expressing the feelings of Mr. Bultitude. The rest accepted it\nnot unwillingly as an escape from the fatigue of original composition,\nbut to him the neat, well-balanced sentences seemed a hollow mockery. As\nhe wrote down each successive phrase, he wondered what Dick would think\nof it, and when at last it was finished, the precious hour had gone for\nanother week!\n\nIn speechless disgust but without protest, for his spirit was too broken\nby this last cruel disappointment, he had to fold, put into an envelope\nand direct this most misleading letter under the Doctor's superintending\neye, which of course allowed him no chance of introducing a line or even\na word to counteract the tone of self-satisfaction and contentment which\nbreathed in every sentence of it.\n\nHe saw it stamped, and put into the postbag, and then his last gleam of\nhope flickered out; he must give up struggling against the Inevitable;\nhe must resign himself to be educated, and perhaps flogged here, while\nDick was filling his house with clowns and pantaloons, destroying his\nreputation and damaging his credit at home. Perhaps, in course of time,\nhe would grow accustomed to it, and, meanwhile, he would be as careful\nas possible to do and say nothing to make himself remarkable in any way,\nby which means he trusted, at least, to avoid any fresh calamity.\n\nAnd with this resolution he went to bed on Saturday night, feeling that\nthis was a dreary finish to a most unpleasant week.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. _A Day of Rest_\n\n     \"There was a letter indeed to be intercepted by a man's father to\n     do him good with him!\"--_Every Man in his Humour._\n\n\n     \"I cannot lose the thought yet of this letter,\n     Sent to my son; nor leave t' admire the change\n     Of manners, and the breeding of our youth\n     Within the kingdom, since myself was one.\"--_Ibid._\n\n\nSunday came--a day which was to begin a new week for Mr. Bultitude, and,\nof course, for the rest of the Christian world as well. Whether that\nweek would be better or worse than the one which had just passed away he\nnaturally could not tell--it could hardly be much worse.\n\nBut the Sunday itself, he anticipated, without, however, any very firm\ngrounds for such an assumption, would be a day of brief but grateful\nrespite; a day on which he might venture to claim much the same immunity\nas was enjoyed in former days by the insolvent; a day, in short, which\nwould glide slowly by with the rather drowsy solemnity peculiar to the\nBritish sabbath as observed by all truly respectable persons.\n\nAnd yet that very Sunday, could he have foreseen it, was destined to be\nthe most eventful day he had yet spent at Crichton House, where none had\nproved wanting in incident. During the next twelve hours he was to pass\nthrough every variety of unpleasant sensation. Embarrassment, suspense,\nfear, anxiety, dismay, and terror were to follow each other in rapid\nsuccession, and to wind up, strangely enough, with a delicious ecstasy\nof pure relief and happiness--a fatiguing programme for any middle-aged\ngentleman who had never cultivated his emotional faculties.\n\nLet me try to tell how this came about. The getting-up bell rang an hour\nlater than on week-days, but the boys were expected to prepare certain\ntasks suitable for the day before they rose. Mr. Bultitude found that he\nwas required to learn by heart a hymn in which the rhymes \"join\" and\n\"divine,\" \"throne\" and \"crown,\" were so happily wedded that either might\nconform to the other--a graceful concession to individual taste which is\nnot infrequent in this class of poetry. Trivial as such a task may seem\nin these days of School Boards, it gave him infinite trouble and mental\nexertion, for he had not been called upon to commit anything of the kind\nto memory for many years, and after mastering that, there still remained\na long chronological list (the dates approximately computed) of the\nleading events before and immediately after the Deluge, which was to be\nrepeated \"without looking at the book.\"\n\nWhile he was wrestling desperately with these, for he was determined, as\nI have said before, to do all in his power to keep himself out of\ntrouble, Mrs. Grimstone, in her morning wrapper, paid a visit to the\ndormitories and, in spite of all Paul's attempts to excuse himself,\ninsisted upon pomatuming his hair--an indignity which he felt acutely.\n\n\"When she knows who I really am,\" he thought, \"she'll be sorry she made\nsuch a point of it. If there's one thing upon earth I loathe more than\nanother, it's marrow-oil pomade!\"\n\nThen there was breakfast, at which Dr. Grimstone appeared, resplendent\nin glossy broadcloth, and dazzling shirt-front and semi-clerical white\ntie, and after breakfast, an hour in the schoolroom, during which the\nboys (by the aid of repeated references to the text) wrote out \"from\nmemory\" the hymn they had learnt, while Paul managed somehow to stumble\nthrough his dates and events to the satisfaction of Mr. Tinkler, who, to\nincrease his popularity, made a point of being as easily satisfied with\nsuch repetitions as he decently could.\n\nAfter that came the order to prepare for church. There was a general\nrush to the little room with the shelves and bandboxes, where church\nbooks were procured, and great-coats and tight kid gloves put on.\n\nWhen they were almost ready the Doctor came in, wearing his blandest and\nmost paternal expression.\n\n\"A--it's a collection Sunday to-day, boys,\" he said. \"Have you all got\nyour threepenny-bits ready? I like to see my boys give cheerfully and\nliberally of their abundance. If any boy does not happen to have any\nsmall change, I can accommodate him if he comes to me.\"\n\nAnd this he proceeded to do from a store he had with him of that most\nconvenient coin--the chosen expression of a congregation's\ngratitude--the common silver threepence, for the school occupied a\nprominent position in the church, and had acquired a great reputation\namongst the churchwardens for the admirable uniformity with which one\nyoung gentleman after another \"put into the plate\"; and this reputation\nthe Doctor was naturally anxious that they should maintain.\n\nI am sorry to say that Mr. Bultitude, fearing lest he should be asked if\nhe had the required sum about him, and thus his penniless condition\nmight be discovered and bring him trouble, got behind the door at the\nbeginning of the money-changing transactions and remained there till it\nwas over--it seemed to him that it would be too paltry to be disgraced\nfor want of threepence.\n\nNow, being thus completely furnished for their devotions, the school\nformed in couples in the hall and filed solemnly out for the march to\nchurch.\n\nMr. Bultitude walked nearly last with Jolland, whose facile nature had\nalmost forgotten his friend's shortcomings on the previous day. He kept\nup a perpetual flow of chatter which, as he never stopped for an answer,\npermitted Paul to indulge his own thoughts unrestrained.\n\n\"Are you going to put your threepenny-bit in?\" said Jolland; \"I won't if\nyou don't. Sometimes, you know, when the plate comes round, old Grim\nsquints down the pews to see we don't shirk. Then I put in sixpence.\nHave you done your hymn? I do hate a hymn. What's the use of learning\nhymns? They won't mark you for them, you know, in any exam. I ever heard\nof, and it can't save you the expense of a hymnbook unless you learnt\nall the hymns in it, and that would take you years. Oh, I say, look!\nthere's young Mutlow and his governor and mater. I wonder what Mutlow's\ngovernor does? Mutlow says he's a 'gentleman' if you ask him, but I\nbelieve he lies. See that fly driving past? Mother Grim\" (the irreverent\nyouth always spoke of Mrs. Grimstone in this way) \"and Dulcie are in it.\nI saw Dulcie look at you, Dick. It's a shame to treat her as you did\nyesterday. There's young Tom on the box; don't his ears stick out\nrummily? I wonder if the 'ugly family' will be at church to-day? You\nknow the ugly family; all with their mouths open and their eyes\ngoggling, like a jolly old row of pantomime heads. And oh, Dick, suppose\nConnie Davenant's people have changed their pew--that'll be a sell for\nyou rather, won't it?\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Bultitude stiffly; \"and, if you don't\nobject, I prefer not to be called upon to talk just now.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right!\" said Jolland, \"there aren't so many fellows who will\ntalk to you; but just as you please--I don't want to talk.\"\n\nAnd so the pair walked on in silence; Jolland with his nose in the air,\ndetermined that after this he really must cut his former friend as the\nother fellows had done, since his devotion was appreciated so little,\nand Paul watching the ascending double line of tall chimney-pot hats as\nthey surged before him in regular movement, and feeling a dull wonder at\nfinding himself setting out to church in such ill-assorted company.\n\nThey entered the church, and Paul was sent down to the extreme end of a\npew next to the one reserved for the Doctor and his family. Dulcie was\nsitting there already on the other side of the partition; but she gave\nno sign of having noticed his arrival, being apparently absorbed in\nstudying the rose-window over the altar.\n\nHe sat down in his corner with a sense of rest and almost comfort,\nthough the seat was not a cushioned one. He had the inoffensive Kiffin\nfor a neighbour, his chief tormentors were far away from him in one of\nthe back pews, and here at least he thought no harm could come to him.\nHe could allow himself safely to do what I am afraid he generally did do\nunder the circumstances--snatch a few intermittent but sweet periods of\ndreamless slumber.\n\nBut, while the service was proceeding, Mr. Bultitude was suddenly\nhorrified to observe that a young lady, who occupied a pew at right\nangles to and touching that in which he sat, was deliberately making\nfurtive signals to him in a most unmistakable manner.\n\nShe was a decidedly pretty girl of about fifteen, with merry and daring\nblue eyes and curling golden hair, and was accompanied by two small\nbrothers (who shared the same book and dealt each other stealthy and\nvicious kicks throughout the service), and by her father, a stout,\nshort-sighted old gentleman in gold spectacles, who was perpetually\nmaking the wrong responses in a loud and confident tone.\n\nTo be signalled to in a marked manner by a strange young lady of great\npersonal attractions might be a coveted distinction to other schoolboys,\nbut it simply gave Mr. Bultitude cold thrills.\n\n\"I suppose _that's_ 'Connie Davenant,'\" he thought, shocked beyond\nmeasure as she caught his eye and coughed demurely for about the fourth\ntime. \"A very forward young person! I think somebody ought to speak\nseriously to her father.\"\n\n\"Good gracious! she's writing something on the flyleaf of her\nprayer-book,\" he said to himself presently. \"I hope she's not going to\nsend it to _me_. I won't take it. She ought to be ashamed of herself!\"\n\nMiss Davenant was indeed busily engaged in pencilling something on a\nblank sheet of paper; and, having finished, she folded it deftly into a\ncocked-hat, wrote a few words on the outside, and placed it between the\nleaves of her book.\n\nThen, as the congregation rose for the Psalms, she gave a meaning glance\nat the blushing and scandalised Mr. Bultitude and by dexterous\nmanagement of her prayer-book shot the little cocked-hat, as if\nunconsciously, into the next pew.\n\nBy a very unfortunate miscalculation, however, the note missed its\nproper object, and, clearing the partition, fluttered deliberately down\non the floor by Dulcie's feet.\n\nPaul saw this with alarm; he knew that at all hazards he must get that\nmiserable note into his own possession and destroy it. It might have his\nname somewhere about it; it might seriously compromise him.\n\nSo he took advantage of the noise the congregation made in repeating a\nverse aloud (it was not a high church) to whisper to Dulcie: \"Little\nMiss Grimstone, excuse me, but there's a--a note in the pew down by your\nfeet. I believe it's intended for me.\"\n\nDulcie had seen the whole affair and had been not a little puzzled by\nit, a clandestine correspondence being a new thing in her short\nexperience; but she understood that in this golden-haired girl, her\nelder by several years, she saw her rival, for whom Dick had so basely\nabandoned her yesterday, and she was old enough to feel the slight and\nthe sweetness of revenge.\n\nSo she held her head rather higher than usual, with her firm little chin\nprojecting wilfully, and waited for the next verse but one before\nretorting, \"Little Master Bultitude, I know it is.\"\n\n\"Could you--can you manage to reach it?\" whispered Paul entreatingly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dulcie, \"I could.\"\n\n\"Then will you--when they sit down?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dulcie firmly, \"I shan't.\"\n\nThe other girl, she noticed with satisfaction, had become aware of the\nsituation and was evidently uneasy. She looked as imploringly as she\ndared at remorseless little Dulcie, as if appealing to her not to get\nher into trouble; but Dulcie bent her eyes obstinately on her book and\nwould not see her.\n\nIf the letter had been addressed to any other boy in the school, she\nwould have done her best to shield the culprits; but this she could not\nbring herself to do here. She found a malicious pleasure in remaining\nabsolutely neutral, which of course was very wrong and ill-natured of\nher.\n\nMr. Bultitude began now to be seriously alarmed. The fatal paper must be\nseen by some one in the Doctor's pew as soon as the congregation sat\ndown again; and, if it reached the Doctor's hands, it was impossible to\nsay what misconstruction he might put upon it or what terrible\nconsequences might not follow.\n\nHe was innocent, perfectly innocent; but though the consciousness of\ninnocence is frequently a great consolation, he felt that unless he\ncould imbue the Doctor with it as well, it would not save him from a\nflogging.\n\nSo he made one more desperate attempt to soften Dulcie's resolution:\n\"Don't be a naughty little girl,\" he said, very injudiciously for his\npurpose, \"I tell you I must have it. You'll get me into a terrible mess\nif you're not careful!\"\n\nBut although Dulcie had been extremely well brought up, I regret to say\nthat the only answer she chose to make to this appeal was that slight\ncontortion of the features, which with a pretty girl is euphemised as a\n\"_moue_,\" and with a plain one is called \"making a face.\" When he saw it\nhe knew that all hope of changing her purpose must be abandoned.\n\nThen they all sat down, and, as Paul had foreseen, there the white\ncocked-hat lay on the dark pew-carpet, hideously distinct, with _billet\ndoux_ in every fold of it!\n\nIt could only be a question of time now. The curate was reading the\nfirst lesson for the day, but Mr. Bultitude heard not a verse of it. He\nwas waiting with bated breath for the blow to fall.\n\nIt fell at last. Dulcie, either with the malevolent idea of hastening\nthe crisis, or (which I prefer to believe for my own part) finding that\nher ex-lover's visible torments were too much for her desire of\nvengeance, was softly moving a heavy hassock towards the guilty note.\nThe movement caught her mother's eye, and in an instant the compromising\npaper was in her watchful hands.\n\nShe read it with incredulous horror, and handed it at once to the\nDoctor.\n\nThe golden-haired one saw it all without betraying herself by any\noutward confusion. She had probably had some experience in such matters,\nand felt tolerably certain of being able, at the worst, to manage the\nold gentleman in the gold spectacles. But she took an early opportunity\nof secretly conveying her contempt for the traitress Dulcie, who\ncontinued to meet her angry glances with the blandest unconsciousness.\n\nDr. Grimstone examined the cocked-hat through his double eyeglasses,\nwith a heavy thunder-cloud gathering on his brows. When he had mastered\nit thoroughly, he bent forward and glared indignantly past his wife and\ndaughter for at least half a minute into the pew where Mr. Bultitude was\ncowering, until he felt that he was coming all to pieces under the\npiercing gaze.\n\nThe service passed all too quickly after that. Paul sat down and stood\nup almost unconsciously with the rest; but for the first time in his\nlife he could have wished the sermon many times longer.\n\nThe horror of his position quite petrified him. After all his prudent\nresolutions to keep out of mischief and to win the regard and confidence\nof his gaoler by his good conduct, like the innocent convict in a\nmelodrama, this came as nothing less than a catastrophe. He walked home\nin a truly dismal state of limp terror.\n\nFortunately for him none of the others seemed to have noticed his\nmisfortune, and Jolland made no further advances. But even the weather\ntended to increase his depression, for it was a bleak, cheerless day,\nwith a bitter and searching wind sweeping the gritty roads where\nyesterday's rain was turned to black ice in the ruts, and the sun shone\nwith a dull coppery glitter that had no warmth or geniality about it.\n\nThe nearer they came to Crichton House the more abjectly miserable\nbecame Mr. Bultitude's state of mind. It was as much as he could do to\ncrawl up the steps to the front door, and his knees positively clapped\ntogether when the Doctor, who had driven home, met them in the hall and\nsaid in a still grave voice, \"Bultitude, when you have taken off your\ncoat, I want you in the study.\"\n\nHe was as long about taking off his coat as he dared, but at last he\nwent trembling into the study, which he found empty. He remembered the\nroom well, with its ebony-framed etchings on the walls, bookcases and\nblue china over the draped mantelpiece, even to a large case of\nelaborately carved Indian chessmen in bullock-carts and palanquins, on\nhorses and elephants, which stood in the window-recess. It was the very\nroom to which he had been shown when he first called about sending his\nson to the school. He had little thought then that the time would come\nwhen he would attend there for the purpose of being flogged; few things\nwould have seemed less probable. Yet here he was.\n\nBut his train of thought was abruptly broken by the entrance of the\nDoctor. He marched solemnly in, holding out the offending missive. \"Look\nat this, sir!\" he said, shaking it angrily before Paul's eyes. \"Look at\nthis! what do you mean by receiving a flippant communication like this\nin a sacred edifice? What do you mean by it?\"\n\n\"I--I didn't receive it,\" said Paul, at his wits' end.\n\n\"Don't prevaricate with me, sir; you know well enough it was intended\nfor you. Have the goodness to read it now, and tell me what you have to\nsay for yourself!\"\n\nPaul read it. It was a silly little school-girl note, half slang and\nhalf sentiment, signed only with the initials C.D. \"Well, sir?\" said the\nDoctor.\n\n\"It's very forward and improper--very,\" said Paul; \"but it's not my\nfault--I can't help it. I gave the girl no encouragement. I never saw\nher before in all my life!\"\n\n\"To my own knowledge, Bultitude, she has sat in that pew regularly for a\nyear.\"\n\n\"Very probably,\" said Paul, \"but I don't notice these matters. I'm past\nthat sort of thing, my dear sir.\"\n\n\"What is her name? Come, sir, you know that.\"\n\n\"Connie Davenant,\" said Paul, taken unawares by the suddenness of the\nquestion. \"At least, I--I heard so to-day.\" He felt the imprudence of\nsuch an admission as soon as he had made it.\n\n\"Very odd that you know her name if you never noticed her before,\" said\nthe Doctor.\n\n\"That young fellow--what's-his-name--Jolland told me,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Ah, but it's odder still that she knows yours, for I perceive it is\ndirected to you by name.\"\n\n\"It's easily explained, my dear sir,\" said Paul; \"easily explained. I've\nno doubt she's heard it somewhere. At least, I never told her; it is not\nlikely. I do assure you I'm as much distressed and shocked by this\naffair as you can be yourself. I am indeed. I don't know what girls are\ncoming to nowadays.\"\n\n\"Do you expect me to believe that you are perfectly innocent?\" said the\nDoctor.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"I can't prevent fast young ladies from\nsending me notes. Why, she might have sent _you_ one!\"\n\n\"We won't go into hypothetical cases,\" said the Doctor, not relishing\nthe war being carried into his own country; \"she happened to prefer you.\nBut, although your virtuous indignation seems to me a trifle overdone,\nsir, I don't see my way clear to punishing you on the facts, especially\nas you tell me you never encouraged these--these overtures, and my\nDulcie, I am bound to say, confirms your statement that it was all the\nother young lady's doing. But if I had had any proof that you had begun\nor responded to her--hem--advances, nothing could have saved you from a\nsevere flogging at the very least--so be careful for the future.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Paul rather feebly, quite overwhelmed by the narrowness of\nhis escape. Then with a desperate effort he found courage to add, \"May\nI--ah--take advantage of this--this restored cordiality to--to--in fact\nto make a brief personal explanation? It--it's what I've been trying to\ntell you for a long time, ever since I first came, only you never will\nhear me out. It's highly important. You've no notion how serious it is!\"\n\n\"There's something about you this term, Richard Bultitude,\" said the\nDoctor slowly, \"that I confess I don't understand. This obstinacy is\nunusual in a boy of your age, and if you really have a mystery it may be\nas well to have it out and have done with it. But I can't be annoyed\nwith it now. Come to me after supper to-night, and I shall be willing to\nhear anything you may have to say.\"\n\nPaul was too overcome at this unexpected favour to speak his thanks. He\ngot away as soon as he could. His path was smoothed at last!\n\nThat afternoon the boys, or all of them who had disposed of the work set\nthem for the day, were sitting in the schoolroom, after a somewhat\nchilly dinner of cold beef, cold tarts, and cold water, passing the time\nwith that description of literature known as \"Sunday reading.\"\n\nAnd here, at the risk of being guilty of a digression, I must pause to\nrecord my admiration for this exceedingly happy form of compromise,\nwhich is, I think, peculiar to the British and, to a certain extent, the\nAmerican nations.\n\nIt has many developments; ranging from the mild Transatlantic compound\nof cookery and camp-meetings, to the semi-novel, redeemed and chastened\nby an arrangement which sandwiches a sermon or a biblical lecture\nbetween each chapter of the story--a great convenience for the race of\nskippers.\n\nThen there are one or two illustrated magazines which it is always\nallowable to read on the Sabbath without fear of rebuke from the\nstrictest--though it is not quite easy to see why.\n\nOpen any one of the monthly numbers, and the chances are that you may\npossibly find at one part a neat little doctrinal essay by a literary\nbishop; the rest of the contents will consist of nothing more serious\nthan a paper upon \"cockroaches and their habits\" by an eminent savant; a\ndescription of foreign travel, done in a brilliant and wholly secular\nvein; and, further on again, an article on Ã¦sthetic furniture--while the\nbalance of the number will be devoted to instalments of two thrilling\nnovels by popular authors, whose theology is seldom their strongest\npoint.\n\nOddly enough, too, when these very novels come out later in three-volume\nform, with the \"mark of the beast\" in the shape of a circulating library\nticket upon them, they will be fortunate if they are not interdicted\naltogether by some of the serious families who take in the magazines as\nbeing \"so suitable for Sundays.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude, at all events, had reason to be grateful for this\ntoleration, for in one of the bound volumes supplied to him he found a\nmost interesting and delightfully unsectarian novel, which appealed to\nhis tastes as a business man, for it was all about commerce and making\nfortunes by blockade-running; and though he was no novel reader as a\nrule, his mind was so relieved and set at rest by the prospect of seeing\nthe end of his trouble at last, that he was able to occupy his mind with\nthe fortunes of the hero.\n\nHe naturally detected technical errors here and there. But that pleased\nhim, and he was becoming so deeply absorbed in the tale that he felt\nseriously annoyed when Chawner came softly up to the desk at which he\nwas sitting, and sat down close to him, crossing his arms before him,\nand leaning forward upon them with his sallow face towards Paul.\n\n\"Dickie,\" he began, in a cautious, oily tone, \"did I hear the Doctor say\nbefore dinner that he would hear anything you have to tell him after\nsupper? Did I?\"\n\n\"I really can't say, sir,\" said Paul; \"if you were near the keyhole at\nthe time, very likely you did.\"\n\n\"The door was open,\" said Chawner, \"and I was in the cloak-room, so I\nheard, and I want to know. What is it you're going to tell the Doctor?\"\n\n\"Mind your own business, sir,\" said Paul sharply.\n\n\"It is my own business,\" said Chawner; \"but I don't want to be told what\nyou're going to tell him. I know.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Mr. Bultitude, annoyed to find his secret in\npossession of this boy of all others.\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated Chawner. \"I know, and I tell you what--I won't have it!\"\n\n\"Won't have it! and why?\"\n\n\"Never mind why. Perhaps I don't choose that the Doctor shall be told\njust yet; perhaps I mean to go up and tell him myself some other day. I\nwant to have a little more fun out of it before I've done.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" said Paul, \"you young ghoul, do you mean to say that all you\ncare for is to see other people's sufferings?\"\n\nChawner grinned maliciously. \"Yes,\" he said suavely; \"it amuses me.\"\n\n\"And so,\" said Paul, \"you want to hold me back a little longer--because\nit's so funny; and then, when you're quite tired of your sport, you'll\ngo up and tell the Doctor my--my unhappy story yourself, eh? No, my\nfriend; I'd rather not tell him myself--but I'll be shot if I let _you_\nhave a finger in it. I know my own interests better than that!\"\n\n\"Don't get in a passion, Dickie,\" said Chawner; \"it's Sunday. You'll\nhave to let me go up instead of you--when I've frightened them a little\nmore.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean by them, sir?\" said Paul, growing puzzled.\n\n\"As if you didn't know! Oh, you're too clever for me, Dickie, I can\nsee,\" sniggered Chawner.\n\n\"I tell you I don't know!\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"Look here, Chawner--your\nconfounded name is Chawner, isn't it?--there's a mistake somewhere, I'm\nsure of it. Listen to me. I'm not going to tell the Doctor what you\nthink I am!\"\n\n\"What do I think you are going to tell him?\"\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea; but, whatever it is, you're wrong.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're too clever, Dickie; you won't betray yourself; but other\npeople want to pay Coker and Tipping out as well as you, and I say you\nmust wait.\"\n\n\"I shan't say anything to affect anyone but myself,\" said Paul; \"if you\nknow all about it, you must know that--it won't interfere with your\namusement that I can see.\"\n\n\"Yes, it will,\" said Chawner irritably, \"it will--you mayn't mean to\ntell of anyone but yourself; but directly Grimstone asks you questions,\nit all comes out. I know all about it. And, anyway, I forbid you to go\nup till I give you leave.\"\n\n\"And who the dooce are you?\" said Mr. Bultitude, nettled at this\nassumption of authority. \"How are you going to prevent me, may I ask?\"\n\n\"S'sh! here's the Doctor,\" whispered Chawner hurriedly. \"I'll tell you\nafter tea. What am I doing out of my place, sir? Oh, I was only asking\nBultitude what was the collect for to-day, sir. Fourth Sunday after the\nEpiphany? thank you, Bultitude.\"\n\nAnd he glided back to his seat, leaving Paul in a state of vague\nuneasiness. Why did this fellow, with the infernal sly face and glib\ntongue, want to prevent him from righting himself with the world, and\nhow could he possibly prevent him? It was absurd; he would take no\nnotice of the young scoundrel--he would defy him.\n\nBut he could not banish the uneasy feeling; the cup had slipped so many\ntimes before at the critical moment that he could not be sure whose hand\nwould be the next to jog his elbow. And so he went down to tea with\nrenewed misgivings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. _Against Time_\n\n     \"There is a kind of Followers likewise, which are dangerous, being\n     indeed Espials; which enquire the Secrets of the House and beare\n     Tales of them.\"--BACON.\n\n\n     \"Then give me leave that I may turn the key,\n     That no man enter till my tale be done.\"\n\n\nVery possibly Chawner's interference in Mr. Bultitude's private affairs\nhas surprised others besides the victim of it; but the fact is that\nthere was a most unfortunate misunderstanding between them from the very\nfirst, which prevented the one from seeing, the other from explaining,\nthe real state of the case.\n\nChawner, of course, no more guessed Paul's true name and nature than\nanyone else who had come in contact with him in his impenetrable\ndisguise, and his motive for attempting to prevent an interview with the\nDoctor can only, I fear, be explained by another slight digression.\n\nThe Doctor, from a deep sense of his responsibility for the morals of\nthose under his care, was perhaps a trifle over-anxious to clear his\nmoral garden of every noxious weed, and too constant in his vigilant\nefforts to detect the growing shoot of evil from the moment it showed\nabove the surface.\n\nAs he could not be everywhere, however, it is evident that many\noffences, trivial or otherwise, must have remained unsuspected and\nunpunished, but for a theory which he had originated and took great\npains to propagate amongst his pupils.\n\nThe theory was that every right-minded boy ought to feel himself in such\na fiduciary position towards his master, that it became a positive duty\nto acquaint him with any delinquencies he might happen to observe among\nhis fellows; and if, at the same time, he was oppressed by a secret\nburden on his own conscience, it was understood that he might hope that\nthe joint revelation would go far to mitigate his own punishment.\n\nIt is doubtful whether this system, though I believe it is found\nsuccessful in Continental colleges, can be usefully applied to English\nboys; whether it may not produce a habit of mutual distrust and\nsuspicion, and a tone the reverse of healthy.\n\nFor myself, I am inclined to think that a schoolmaster will find it\nbetter in the long run, for both the character and morals of his school,\nif he is not too anxious to play the detective, and refrains from\nencouraging the more weak-minded or cowardly boys to save themselves by\nturning \"schoolmaster's evidence.\"\n\nDr. Grimstone thought otherwise; but it must be allowed that the system,\nas in vogue at Crichton House, did not work well.\n\nThere were boys, of course, who took a sturdier view of their own rights\nand duties, and despised the talebearers as they deserved; there were\nothers, also, too timid and too dependent on the good opinion of others\nto risk the loss of it by becoming informers; but there were always one\nor two whose consciences were unequal to the burden of their neighbour's\nsin, and could only be relieved by frank and full confession.\n\nUnhappily they had, as a general rule, contributed largely to the sum\nof guilt themselves, and did not resort to disclosure until detection\nseemed reasonably imminent.\n\nChawner was the leader of this conscientious band; he revelled in the\nsystem. It gave him the means at once of gratifying the almost universal\nlove of power and of indulging a catlike passion for playing with the\nfeelings of others, which, it is to be hoped, is more uncommon.\n\nHe knew he was not popular, but he could procure most of the incidents\nof popularity; he could have his little court of cringing toadies; he\ncould levy his tribute of conciliatory presents, and vent many private\nspites and hatreds into the bargain--and he generally did.\n\nHaving himself a tendency to acts of sly disobedience, he found it a\ncongenial pastime to set the fashion from time to time in some one of\nthe peccadilloes to which boyhood is prone, and to which the Doctor's\nsomewhat restrictive code added a large number, and as soon as he saw a\nsufficient number of his companions satisfactorily implicated, his\nopportunity came.\n\nHe would take the chief culprits aside, and profess, in strict\nconfidence, certain qualms of conscience which he feared could only be\nappeased by unburdening his guilt-laden soul.\n\nTo this none would have had any right to object--had it not necessarily,\nor at least from Chawner's point of view, involved a full, true, and\nparticular account of the misdoings of each and every one; and\nconsequently, for some time after these professions of misgivings,\nChawner would be surrounded by a little crowd of anxiously obsequious\nfriends, all trying hard to overcome his scruples or persuade him at\nleast to omit their names from his revelations.\n\nSometimes he would affect to be convinced by their arguments and send\nthem away reassured; at others his scruples would return in an\naggravated form; and so he would keep them on tenterhooks of suspense\nfor days and weeks, until he was tired of the amusement--for this\npractising on the fears of weaker natures is a horribly keen delight to\nsome--or until some desperate little dog, unable to bear his torture any\nlonger, would threaten to give himself up and make an end of it.\n\nThen Chawner, to do him justice, always relieved him from so\ndisagreeable a necessity, and would go softly into the Doctor's study,\nand, in a subdued and repentant tone, pour out his general confession\nfor the public good.\n\nProbably the Doctor did not altogether respect the instruments he saw\nfit to use in this way; some would have declined to hear the informer\nout, flogged him well, and forgotten it; but Dr. Grimstone--though he\nwas hardly likely to be impressed by these exhibitions of noble candour,\nand did not fail to see that the prospect of obtaining better terms for\nthe penitent himself had something to do with them--yet encouraged the\nsystem as a matter of policy, went thoroughly into the whole affair, and\nmade it the cause of an explosion which he considered would clear the\nmoral atmosphere for some time to come.\n\nI hope that, after this explanation, Chawner's opposition to Mr.\nBultitude's plans will be better understood.\n\nAfter tea, he made Paul a little sign to follow him, and the two went\nout together into the little glass-house beyond the schoolroom; it was\ndark, but there was light enough from the room inside for them to see\neach other's face.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" began Paul, with dignity, when he had closed the glass door\nbehind him, \"perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me how you mean to\nprevent me from seeing Dr. Grimstone, and telling him--telling him what\nI have to tell him?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, Dickie,\" said Chawner, with an evil smirk. \"You shall\nknow soon enough.\"\n\n\"Don't stand grinning at me like that, sir,\" said the angry Mr.\nBultitude; \"say it out at once; it will make no difference to me, I give\nyou warning!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes it will, though. I think it will. Wait. I heard all you said to\nGrimstone in the study to-day about that girl--Connie Davenant, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I don't care; I am innocent. I have nothing to reproach myself with.\"\n\n\"What a liar you are!\" said Chawner, more in admiration than rebuke.\n\"You told him you never gave her any encouragement, didn't you? And he\nsaid if he ever found you had, nothing could save you from a licking,\ndidn't he?\"\n\n\"He did,\" said Paul, \"he was quite right from his point of view--what\nthen?\"\n\n\"Why, this,\" said Chawner: \"Do you remember giving Jolland, the last\nSunday of last term, a note for that very girl?\"\n\n\"I never did!\" said poor Mr. Bultitude, \"I never saw the wretched girl\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Chawner, \"but I've got the note in my pocket! Jolland was\nseedy and asked me to take it for you, and I read it, and it was so\nnicely written that I thought I should like to keep it myself, and so I\ndid--and here it is!\"\n\nAnd he drew out with great caution a piece of crumpled paper and showed\nit to the horrified old gentleman. \"Don't snatch ... it's rude; there it\nis, you see: 'My dear Connie' ... 'yours ever, Dick Bultitude.' No, you\ndon't come any nearer ... there, now it's safe.... Now what do you mean\nto do?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" said Paul, feeling absolutely checkmated. \"Give me\ntime.\"\n\n\"I tell you what I mean to do; I shall keep my eye on you, and directly\nI see you making ready to go to Grimstone, I shall get up first and take\nhim this ... then you'll be done for. You'd better give in, really,\nDickie!\"\n\nThe note was too evidently genuine; Dick must have written it (as a\nmatter of fact he had; in a moment of pique, no doubt, at some caprice\nof his real enslaver Dulcie's--but his fickleness brought fatal results\non his poor father's undeserving head)--if this diabolical Chawner\ncarried out his threats he would indeed be \"done for\"; he did not yet\nfully understand the other's motive, but he thought that he feared lest\nPaul, in declaring his own sorrows, might also accuse Tipping and Coker\nof acts of cruelty and oppression, which Chawner proposed to denounce\nhimself at some more convenient opportunity; he hesitated painfully.\n\n\"Well?\" said Chawner, \"make up your mind; are you going to tell him, or\nnot?\"\n\n\"I must!\" said Paul hoarsely. \"I promise you I shall not bring any other\nnames in ... I don't want to ... I only want to save myself--and I can't\nstand it any longer. Why should you stand between me and my rights in\nthis currish way? I didn't know there were boys like you in the world,\nsir; you're a young monster!\"\n\n\"I don't mean you to tell the Doctor anything at all,\" said Chawner. \"I\nshall do what I said.\"\n\n\"Then do your worst!\" said Paul, stung to defiance.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" returned Chawner meekly, \"I will--and we'll see who\nwins!\"\n\nAnd they went back to the schoolroom again, where Mr. Bultitude, boiling\nwith rage and seriously alarmed as well, tried to sit down and appear as\nif nothing had happened.\n\nChawner sat down too, in a place from which he could see all Paul's\nmovements, and they both watched one another anxiously from the corners\nof their eyes till the Doctor came in.\n\n\"It's a foggy evening,\" he said as he entered: \"the younger boys had\nbetter stay in. Chawner, you and the rest of the first form can go to\nchurch; get ready at once.\"\n\nPaul's heart leaped with triumph; with his enemy out of the way, he\ncould carry out his purpose unhindered. The same thing apparently\noccurred to Chawner, for he said mildly, \"Please, sir, may Richard\nBultitude come too?\"\n\n\"Can't Bultitude ask leave for himself?\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"I, sir!\" said the horrified Paul, \"it's a mistake--I don't want to go.\nI--I don't feel very well this evening!\"\n\n\"Then you see, Chawner, you misunderstood him. By the way, Bultitude,\nthere was something you were to tell me, I think?\"\n\nChawner's small glittering eyes were fixed on Paul menacingly as he\nmanaged to stammer that he did want to say something in private.\n\n\"Very well, I am going out to see a friend for an hour or so--when I\ncome back I will hear you,\" and he left the room abruptly.\n\nChawner would very probably have petitioned to stay in that evening as\nwell, had he had time and presence of mind to do so; as it was, he was\nobliged to go away and get ready for church, but when his preparations\nwere made he came back to Paul, and leaning over him said with an\nunpleasant scowl, \"If I get back in time, Bultitude, we'll see whether\nyou baulk me quite so easily. If I come back and find you've done it--I\nshall take in that letter!\"\n\n\"You may do what you please then,\" said Paul, in a high state of\nirritation, \"I shall be well out of your reach by that time. Now have\nthe goodness to take yourself off.\"\n\nAs he went, Mr. Bultitude thought, \"I never in all my life saw such a\nfellow as that, never! It would give me real pleasure to hire someone to\nkick him.\"\n\nThe evening passed quietly; the boys left at home sat in their places,\nreading or pretending to read. Mr. Blinkhorn, left in charge of them,\nwas at his table in the corner noting up his diary. Paul was free for a\ntime to think over his position.\n\nAt first he was calm and triumphant; his dearest hopes, his\nlong-wished-for opportunity of a fair and unprejudiced hearing, were at\nlast to be fulfilled--Chawner was well out of the way for the best part\nof two hours--the Doctor was very unlikely to be detained nearly so long\nover one call; his one anxiety was lest he might not be able, after all,\nto explain himself in a thoroughly effective manner--he planned out a\nlittle scheme for doing this.\n\nHe must begin gradually of course, so as not to alarm the schoolmaster\nor raise doubts of his sincerity or, worse still, his sanity. Perhaps a\nslight glance at instances of extraordinary interventions of the\nsupernatural from the earliest times, tending to show the extreme\nprobability of their survival on rare occasions even to the present day,\nmight be a prudent and cautious introduction to the subject--only he\ncould not think of any, and, after all, it might weary the Doctor.\n\nHe would start somewhat in this manner: \"You cannot, my dear sir, have\nfailed to observe since our meeting this year, a certain difference in\nmy manner and bearing\"--one's projected speeches are somehow generally\ncouched in finer language than, when it comes to the point, the tongue\ncan be prevailed upon to utter. Mr. Bultitude learned this opening\nsentence by heart, he thought it taking and neat, the sort of thing to\nfix his hearer's attention from the first.\n\nAfter that he found it difficult to get any further; he knew himself\nthat all he was about to describe was plain, unvarnished fact--but how\nwould it strike a stranger's ear? He found himself seeking ways in which\nto tone down the glaring improbability of the thing as much as possible,\nbut in vain; \"I don't know how I shall ever get it all out,\" he told\nhimself at last; \"if I think about it much longer I shall begin to\ndisbelieve in it myself.\"\n\nHere Biddlecomb came up in a confidential manner and sat down by Paul;\n\"Dick,\" he began, in rather a trembling voice, \"did I hear the Doctor\nsay something about your having something to tell him?\"\n\n\"Oh Lord, here's another of them now!\" thought Paul. \"You are right,\nyoung sir,\" he said: \"have you any objection? mention it, you know, if\nyou have, pray mention it. It's a matter of life and death to me, but if\nyou at all disapprove, of course that ought to be final!\"\n\n\"No, but,\" protested Biddlecomb, \"I, I daresay I've not treated you very\nwell lately, I----\"\n\n\"You were kind enough to suggest several very uncommonly unpleasant ways\nof annoying me, sir,\" said Paul resentfully, \"if you mean that. You've\nkicked me more than once, and your handkerchief, unless I am very much\nmistaken, had the biggest and the hardest knot in it yesterday. If that\ngives you the right to interfere and dictate to me now, like your\namiable friend, Master Chawner, I suppose you have it.\"\n\n\"Now you're angry,\" said Biddlecomb humbly; \"I don't wonder at it. I've\nbehaved like a cad, I know, but, and this is what I wanted to say, I was\nsorry for you all the time.\"\n\n\"That's very comforting,\" said Paul drily; \"thank you. I'm vastly\nobliged to you.\"\n\n\"I was, though,\" said Biddlecomb. \"I, I was led away by the other\nfellows--I always liked you, you know, Bultitude.\"\n\n\"You've a very odd way of showing your affection,\" remarked Mr.\nBultitude; \"but go on, let me hear all you have to say.\"\n\n\"It isn't much,\" said Biddlecomb, quite broken down; \"only don't sneak\nof me this time, Dick, let me off, there's a good fellow. I'll stick up\nfor you after this, I will really. You used not to be a fellow for\nsneaking once. It's caddish to sneak!\"\n\n\"Don't be alarmed, my good friend,\" said Paul; \"I won't poach on that\nexcellent young man Chawner's preserves. What I am going to tell the\nDoctor has nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"On your honour?\" said Biddlecomb eagerly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Paul testily, \"on my honour. Now, perhaps, you'll let me\nalone. No, I won't shake hands, sir. I've had to accept your kicks, but\nI don't want your friendship.\"\n\nBiddlecomb went off, looking slightly ashamed of himself but visibly\nrelieved from a haunting fear. \"Thank goodness!\" thought Paul, \"he\nwasn't as obstinate as the other fellow. What a set they are! I knew it,\nthere's another boy coming up now!\"\n\nAnd indeed one boy after another came up in the same way as Biddlecomb\nhad done, some cringing more than others, but all vowing that they had\nnever intended to do any harm, and entreating him to change his mind\nabout complaining of his ill-treatment. They brought little offerings to\npropitiate him and prove the depth of their unaltered\nregard--pencil-cases and pocket-knives, and so forth, until they drove\nPaul nearly to desperation. However, he succeeded in dispelling their\nfears after some hot arguments, and had just sent away the last\nsuppliant, when he saw Jolland too rise and come towards him.\n\nJolland leaned across Paul's desk with folded arms and looked him full\nin the face with his shallow light green eyes. \"I don't know what you've\nsaid to all those chaps,\" he began; \"they've come back looking precious\nglum, but they won't tell me what you said,\" (Mr. Bultitude had in\nsatisfying their alarm taken care to let them know his private opinion\nof them, which was not flattering), \"but I've got something to say to\nyou, and it's this. I never thought you would quite come down to this\nsort of thing!\"\n\n\"What sort of thing?\" said Paul, who was beginning to have enough of it.\n\n\"Why, going up and letting on against all of us--it's mean, you know. If\nyou have got bashed about pretty well since you came back, it's been\nall your own fault, and you know it. Last term you got on well\nenough--this time you began to be queer and nasty the very first day you\ncame. I thought it was one of your larks at first, but I don't know what\nit is now, and I don't care. I stood up for you as long as I could, till\nyou acted like a funk yesterday. Then I took my share in lamming you,\nand I'd do it again. But if you are cad enough to pay us all out in this\nway, I'll have no more to do with you--mind that. That's all I came to\nsay.\"\n\nThis was an unpalatable way of putting things, but Paul could not help\nseeing that there was some truth in it. Jolland had been kind to him,\ntoo, in a careless sort of way, and at some cost to himself; so it was\nwith more mildness than temper that he answered him.\n\n\"You're on the wrong tack, my boy, the wrong tack. I've no wish to tell\ntales of anyone, as I've been trying to explain to your friends. There's\nsomething the matter with me which you wouldn't understand if I told\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know,\" said Jolland, mollified; \"if it's only physic you\nwant.\"\n\n\"Whatever it is,\" said Paul, not caring to undeceive him, \"it won't\naffect you or anyone here, but myself. You're not a bad young fellow, I\nbelieve. I don't want to get you into trouble, sir; you don't want much\nassistance, I'm afraid, in that department. So be off, like a good\nfellow, and leave me in peace.\"\n\nAll these interviews had taken time. He was alarmed on looking at the\nclock to see that it was nearly eight; the Doctor was a long time over\nthat call--for the first time he began to feel uneasy--he made hurried\nmental calculations as to the probability of the Doctor or Chawner being\nthe first to return.\n\nThe walk to church took about twenty minutes; say the service took an\nhour, allowing for the return, he might expect Chawner by about\nhalf-past eight; it was striking the hour now--half an hour only in\nwhich he could hope for any favourable result from the interview!\n\nFor he saw this plainly, that if Chawner were once permitted to get the\nDoctor's ear first and show him that infamous love-note, no explanation\nof his (even if he had nerve to make it then, which he doubted) could\npossibly seem anything more than a desperate and far-fetched excuse; if\nhe could anticipate Chawner, on the other hand, and once convince the\nDoctor of the truth of his story, the informer's malice would fall flat.\n\nAnd still the long hand went rapidly on, as Mr. Bultitude sat staring\nstupidly at it with a faint sick feeling--it had passed the quarter\nnow--why did the Doctor delay in this unwarrantable manner? What a farce\nsocial civilities were--if he had allowed himself to be prevailed on to\nstay to supper! Twenty minutes past; Chawner and the others might return\nat any moment--a ring at the bell; they were there! all was over\nnow--no, he was saved, that was Dr. Grimstone's voice in the hall--what\nan unconscionable time he was taking off his greatcoat and gloves.\n\nBut all comes to the man who waits. In another moment the Doctor looked\nin, singled out Mr. Bultitude with a sharp glance, and a, \"Now,\nBultitude, I will hear you!\" and led the way to his study.\n\nPaul staggered rather than walked after him: as usual at the critical\nmoment his carefully prepared opening had deserted him--his head felt\nheavy and crowded--he wanted to run away, but forced himself to overcome\nsuch a suicidal proceeding and follow to the study.\n\nThere was a lighted reading-lamp with a green glass shade upon the\ntable. The Doctor sat down by it in an armchair by the fire, crossed his\nlegs, and joined the tops of his fingers together. \"Now, Bultitude,\" he\nsaid again.\n\n\"Might I--might I sit down?\" said poor Mr. Bultitude in a thick voice;\nit was all that occurred to him to say.\n\n\"Sit by all means,\" said the Doctor blandly.\n\nSo Paul drew a chair opposite the Doctor and sat down. He tried\ndesperately to clear his head and throat and begin; but the only\ndistinct thought in his mind just then was that the green lamp-shade\nlent a particularly ghastly hue to the Doctor's face.\n\n\"Take your time, Bultitude,\" said the latter, after a long minute, in\nwhich a little skeleton clock on the mantelpiece ticked loudly--\"there's\nno hurry, my boy.\"\n\nBut this only reminded Paul that there was every need for hurry--Chawner\nmight come in, and follow him here, unless he made haste.\n\nStill, he could only say, \"You see me in a very agitated state, Dr.\nGrimstone--a very agitated state, sir.\"\n\nThe Doctor gave a short, dry cough. \"Well, Bultitude,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact is, sir, I'm in a most unfortunate position, and--and the\nworst of it is, I don't know how to begin.\" Here he made another dead\nstop, while the Doctor raised his heavy eyebrows, and looked at the\nclock.\n\n\"Do you see any prospect of your finding yourself able to begin soon?\"\nhe inquired at last, with rather suspicious suavity. \"Perhaps if you\ncame to me later on----\"\n\n\"Not for the world!\" said Paul, in a highly nervous condition. \"I shall\nbegin very soon, Doctor, I shall begin directly. Mine is such a very\nsingular case; it's difficult, as you see, to, to open it!\"\n\n\"Have you anything on your mind?\" asked the Doctor suddenly.\n\nPaul could hear steps and voices in the adjoining cloakroom--the\nchurchgoers had returned. \"Yes--no!\" he answered, losing his head\ncompletely now.\n\n\"That's a somewhat extraordinary, not to say an ambiguous, reply,\" said\nthe Doctor; \"what am I to understand by----\"\n\nThere was a tap at the door. Paul started to his feet in a panic. \"Don't\nlet him in!\" he shrieked, finding his voice at last. \"Hear me first--you\nshall hear me first! Say that other rascal is not to come in. He wants\nto ruin me!\"\n\n\"I was going to say I was engaged,\" said the Doctor; \"but there's\nsomething under this I must understand. Come in, whoever you are.\"\n\nAnd the door opened softly, and Chawner stepped meekly in; he was rather\npale and breathed hard, but was otherwise quite composed.\n\n\"Now, then, Chawner,\" said the Doctor impatiently, \"what is it? Have you\nsomething on your mind, too?\"\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Chawner, \"has Bultitude told you anything yet?\"\n\n\"No, why? Hold your tongue, Bultitude. I shall hear Chawner now--not\nyou!\"\n\n\"Because, sir,\" explained Chawner, \"he knew I had made up my mind to\ntell you something I thought you ought to know about him, and so he\nthreatened to come first and tell some falsehood (I'm sure I don't know\nwhat) about me, sir. I think I ought to be here too.\"\n\n\"It's a lie!\" shouted Paul, \"What a villain that boy is! Don't believe a\nword he says, Dr. Grimstone; it's all false--all!\"\n\n\"This is very suspicious,\" said the Doctor; \"if your conscience were\ngood, Bultitude, you could have no object in preventing me from hearing\nChawner. Chawner, in spite of some obvious defects in his character,\" he\nwent on, with a gulp (he never could quite overcome a repulsion to the\nboy), \"is, on the whole, a right-minded and, ah, conscientious boy. I\nhear Chawner first.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, if you please,\" said Chawner, with an odious side smirk of\ntriumph at Paul, who, quite crushed by the horror of the situation, had\ncollapsed feebly on his chair again, \"I thought it was my duty to let\nyou see this. I found it to-day in Bultitude's prayerbook, sir.\" And he\nhanded Dick's unlucky scrawl to the Doctor, who took it to the lamp and\nread it hurriedly through.\n\nAfter that there was a terrible moment of dead silence; then the Doctor\nlooked up and said shortly, \"You did well to tell me of this, Chawner;\nyou may go now.\"\n\nWhen they were alone once more he turned upon the speechless Paul with\nfurious scorn and indignation. \"Contemptible liar and hypocrite,\" he\nthundered, pacing restlessly up and down the room in his excitement,\ntill Paul felt very like Daniel, without his sense of security, \"you are\nunmasked--unmasked, sir! You led me to believe that you were as much\nshocked and pained at this girl's venturing to write to you as I could\nbe myself. You called it, quite correctly, 'forward and improper'; you\npretended you had never given her the least encouragement--had not heard\nher name even--till to-day. And here is a note, written, as I should\nimagine, some time since, in which you address her as 'Connie Davenant,'\nand have the impudence to admire the hat she wore the Sunday before! I\nshudder, sir, to think of such duplicity, such precocious and shameless\ndepravity. It astounds me. It deprives me of all power to think!\"\n\nPaul made some faint and inarticulate remark about being a family\nman--always most particular, and so forth--luckily it passed unheard.\n\n\"What shall I do with you?\" continued the Doctor; \"how shall I punish\nsuch monstrous misconduct?\"\n\n\"Don't ask _me_, sir,\" said Paul, desperately--\"only, for heaven's sake,\nget it over as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"If I linger, sir,\" retorted the Doctor, \"it is because I have grave\ndoubts whether your offence can be expiated by a mere flogging--whether\nthat is not altogether too light a retribution.\"\n\n\"He can't want to _torture_ me,\" thought Paul.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Doctor again, \"the doubt has prevailed. On a mind so\nhardened the cane would leave no lasting impression. I cannot allow your\ninnocent companions to run the risk of contamination from your society.\nI must not permit this serpent to glide uncrushed, this cockatrice to\npractise his epistolary wiles, within my peaceful fold. My mind is made\nup--at whatever cost to myself--however it may distress and grieve your\ngood father, who is so pathetically anxious for you to do him credit,\nsir. I must do my duty to the parents of the boys entrusted to my care.\nI shall not flog you, sir, for I feel it would be useless. I shall expel\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" Paul leaped up incredulous. \"Expel me? Do I hear you aright, Dr.\nGrimstone? Say it again--you will expel me?\"\n\n\"I have said it,\" the Doctor said sternly; \"no expostulations can move\nme now\" (as if Mr. Bultitude was likely to expostulate!) \"Mrs. Grimstone\nwill see that your boxes are packed the first thing to-morrow morning,\nand I shall take you myself to the station and consign you to the home\nyou have covered with blushes and shame, by the 9.15 train, and I shall\nwrite a letter to-night explaining the causes for your dismissal.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude covered his face with his hands, to hide, not his shame\nand distress, but his indecent rapture. It seemed almost too good to be\ntrue! He saw himself about to be provided with every means of reaching\nhome in comfort and safety. He need dread no pursuit now. There was no\nchance, either, of his being forced to return to the prison-house--the\nDoctor's letter would convince even Dick of the impossibility of that.\nAnd, best of all, this magnificent stroke of good luck had been obtained\nwithout the ignominy and pain of a flogging, without even the unpleasant\nnecessity of telling his strange secret.\n\nBut (having gained some experience during his short stay at the school)\nhe had the duplicity to pretend to sob bitterly.\n\n\"But one night more, sir,\" continued the Doctor, \"shall you pass beneath\nthis roof, and that apart from your fellows. You will occupy the spare\nbedroom until the morning, when you quit the school in disgrace--for\never.\"\n\nI said in another chapter that this Sunday would find Paul, at its\nclose, after a trying course of emotions, in a state of delicious\necstasy of pure relief and happiness--and really that scarcely seems too\nstrong an expression for his feelings.\n\nWhen he found himself locked securely into a comfortable, warm bedroom,\nwith curtains and a carpet in it, safe from the persecutions of all\nthose terrible boys, and when he remembered that this was actually the\nlast night of his stay here--that he would certainly see his own home\nbefore noon next day, the reaction was so powerful that he could not\nrefrain from skipping and leaping about the room in a kind of hysterical\ngaiety.\n\nAnd as he laid his head down on a yielding lavender-scented pillow, his\nthoughts went back without a pang to the varied events of the day; they\nhad been painful, very painful, but it was well worth while to have gone\nthrough them to appreciate fully the delightful intensity of the\ncontrast. He freely forgave all his tormentors, even Chawner--for had\nnot Chawner procured his release?--and he closed his eyes at last with a\nsmile of Sybaritic satisfaction and gentle longing for the Monday's dawn\nto break.\n\nAnd yet some, after his experiences, would have had their misgivings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. _A Respite_\n\n     \"Discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras.\"\n\n\nBlithe and gay was Mr. Bultitude when he opened his eyes on Monday\nmorning and realised his incredible good fortune; in a few hours he\nwould be travelling safely and comfortably home, with every facility for\nregaining his rights. He chuckled--though his sense of humour was not\nlarge--he chuckled, as he lay snugly in bed, to think of Dick's\ndiscomfiture on seeing him return so unexpectedly; he began to put it\ndown, quite unwarrantably, to his own cleverness, as having conceived\nand executed such a stroke of genius as procuring his own expulsion.\n\nHe remained in bed until long after the getting-up bell had rung,\nfeeling that his position ensured him perfect impunity in this, and when\nhe rose at length it was in high spirits, and he dressed himself with a\ngrowing toleration for things in general, very unlike his ordinary frame\nof mind. When he had finished his toilet, the Doctor entered the room.\n\n\"Bultitude,\" he said gravely, \"before sending you from us, I should like\nto hear from your own lips that you are not altogether without\ncontrition for your conduct.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude considered that such an acknowledgment could not possibly\ndo any harm, so he said--as, indeed, he might with perfect truth--that\n\"he very much regretted what had passed.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear that,\" said the Doctor, more briskly, \"very glad; it\nrelieves me from a very painful responsibility. It may not impossibly\ninduce me to take a more lenient view of your case.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" gasped Mr. Bultitude, feeling very uncomfortable all at once.\n\n\"Yes; it is a serious step to ruin a boy's career at its outset by\nunnecessary harshness. Nothing, of course, can palliate the extreme\nbaseness of your behaviour. Still from certain faint indications in your\ncharacter of better things, I do not despair even yet (after you have\nreceived a public lesson at my hands, which you will never forget) of\nrearing you to become in time an ornament to the society in which it\nwill be your lot to move. I will not give up in despair--I will\npersevere a little longer.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Paul faltered, with a sudden sinking sensation.\n\n\"Mrs. Grimstone, too,\" said the Doctor, \"has been interceding for you;\nshe has represented to me that a public expression of my view of your\nconduct, together with a sharp, severe dose of physical pain, would be\nmore likely to effect a radical improvement in your character, and to\nsoften your perverted heart, than if I sent you away in hopeless\ndisgrace, without giving you an opportunity of showing a desire to\namend.\"\n\n\"It's--very kind of Mrs. Grimstone,\" said Paul faintly.\n\n\"Then I hope you will show your appreciation of her kindness. Yes, I\nwill not expel you. I will give you one more chance to retrieve your\nlost reputation. But, for your own sake, and as a public warning, I\nshall take notice of your offence in public. I shall visit it upon you\nby a sound flogging before the whole school at eleven o'clock. You need\nnot come down till then--your breakfast will be sent up to you.\"\n\nPaul made a frantic attempt to dissuade him from his terrible\ndetermination. \"Dr. Grimstone,\" he said, \"I--I should much prefer being\nexpelled, if it is all the same to you.\"\n\n\"It is not all the same to me,\" said the Doctor. \"This is mere pride and\nobstinacy, Bultitude; I should do wrong to take any notice of it.\"\n\n\"I--I tell you I have great objection to--to being flogged,\" said Paul\neagerly; \"it wouldn't improve me at all; it would harden me,\nsir,--harden me. I--I cannot allow you to flog me, Dr. Grimstone. I have\nstrong prejudices against the system of corporal punishment. I object to\nit on principle. Expulsion would make me quite a different being, I\nassure you; it would reform me--save me--it would indeed.\"\n\n\"So, to escape a little personal inconvenience, you would be content to\nbring sorrow upon your worthy father's grey head, would you, sir?\" said\nthe Doctor. \"I shall not oblige you in this. Nor, I may add, will your\ncowardice induce me to spare you in your coming chastisement. I leave\nyou, sir--we shall meet again at eleven!\"\n\nAnd he stalked out of the room. Perhaps, though he did not admit this\neven to himself, there were more considerations for commuting the\nsentence of expulsion than those he had mentioned. Boys are not often\nexpelled from private schools, except for especially heinous offences,\nand in this case there was no real reason why the Doctor should be\nQuixotic enough to throw up a portion of his income--particularly if he\ncould produce as great a moral effect by other means.\n\nBut his clemency was too much for Mr. Bultitude; he threw himself on the\nbed and raved at the hideous fate in store for him; ten short minutes\nago, and he had been so happy--so certain of release--and now, not only\nwas he as far from all hope of escape as ever, but he had the certainty\nbefore him of a sound flogging in less than two hours!\n\nJust after something has befallen us which, for good or ill, will make a\ngreat change in our lives, what a totally new aspect the common everyday\nthings about us are apt to wear--the book we were reading, the letter we\nhad begun, the picture we knew--what a new and tender attraction they\nmay have for us, or what a grim and terrible irony!\n\nSomething of this Paul felt dimly, as he finished dressing, in a dazed,\nunconscious manner. The comfortable bedroom, with its delicately-toned\nwall-paper and flowery cretonnes, had become altogether hateful in his\neyes now. Instead of feeling grateful (as he surely ought to have been)\nfor the one night of perfect security and comfort he had passed there,\nhe only loathed it for the delusive peace it had brought him.\n\nThere was a gentle tap at the door, and Dulcie came in, bearing a tray\nwith his breakfast, and looking like a little Royalist bearing food to a\nfugitive Cavalier; though Paul did not quite carry out his share of the\nsimile.\n\n\"There!\" she said, almost cheerfully; \"I got Mummy to let me take up\nyour breakfast; and there's an egg for you, and muffins.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude sat on a chair and groaned.\n\n\"You might say 'thank you,'\" said Dulcie, pouting. \"That other girl\nwouldn't have brought you up much breakfast if she'd been in my place. I\nwas going to tell you that I'd forgiven you, because very likely you\nnever meant her to write to you\" (Dulcie had not been told the sequel to\nthe Davenant episode, which was quite as well for Paul). \"But you don't\nseem to care whether I do or not.\"\n\n\"I feel so miserable!\" sighed Paul.\n\n\"Then you must drink some coffee,\" prescribed Dulcie decidedly; \"and you\nmust eat some breakfast. I brought an egg on purpose; it's so\nstrengthening, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" cried Paul, with a short howl of distress at this suggestion.\n\"Don't talk about the--the flogging, I can't bear it.\"\n\n\"But it's not papa's _new_ cane, you know, Dick,\" said Dulcie\nconsolingly. \"I've hidden that; it's only the old one, and you always\nsaid that didn't hurt so very much, after a little while. It isn't as if\nit was the horsewhip, either. Daddy lost that out riding in the\nholidays.\"\n\n\"Oh, the horsewhip's worse, is it?\" said Paul, with a sickly smile.\n\n\"Tom says so,\" said Dulcie. \"After all, Dick, it will be all over in\nfive minutes, or, perhaps, a little longer, and I do think you oughtn't\nto mind that so much, now, after mamma and I have begged you off from\nbeing expelled. We might never have seen one another again, Dick!\"\n\n\"You begged me off!\" cried Paul.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dulcie; \"Daddy wouldn't change his mind for ever so\nlong--till I coaxed him. I couldn't bear to let you go.\"\n\n\"You've done a very cruel thing,\" said Paul. \"For such a little girl as\nyou are, you've done an immense amount of mischief. But for you, that\nletter would not have been found out. You need not have spoilt my only\nchance of getting out of this horrible place!\"\n\nDulcie set down the tray, and, putting her hands behind her, leaned\nagainst a corner of a wardrobe.\n\n\"And is that all you say to me!\" she said, with a little tremble in her\nvoice.\n\n\"That is all,\" said Paul. \"I've no doubt you meant well, but you\nshouldn't have interfered. All this has come upon me through that. Take\naway the breakfast. It makes me ill even to look at it.\"\n\nDulcie shook out her long brown hair, and clenched her small fist in an\nundeniable passion, for she had something of her father's hot temper\nwhen roused. \"Very well, then,\" she said, moving with great dignity\ntowards the door. \"I'm very sorry I ever did interfere. I wish I'd let\nyou be sent home to your papa, and see what he'd do to you. But I'll\nnever, never interfere one bit with you again. I won't say one single\nword to you any more.... I'll never even look at you if you want me to\never so much.... I shall tell Tipping he can hit you as much as ever he\nlikes, and I shall show Tom where I put the new cane--and I only hope it\nwill hurt!\" And with this parting shot she was gone.\n\nMr. Bultitude wandered disconsolately about the upper part of the house\nafter this, not daring to go down, and not able to remain in any one\nplace. The maids who came up to make the beds looked at him with pitiful\ninterest, but he was too proud to implore help from them. To hide would\nonly make matters worse, for, as he had not a penny in his pocket, and\nno probability of being able to borrow one, he must remain in the house\ntill hunger forced him from his hiding-place--supposing they did not\nhunt him out long before that time.\n\nThe shouts of the boys in the playground during their half-hour's play\nhad long since died away; he heard the clock in the hall strike\neleven--time for him to seek his awful rendezvous. The Doctor had not\nforgotten him, he found, for presently the butler came up and\nceremoniously announced that the Doctor \"would see him now, if he\npleased.\"\n\nHe stumbled downstairs in a half-unconscious condition, the butler threw\nopen the two doors which led to the schoolroom, and Paul tottered in,\nmore dead than alive with shame and fear.\n\nThe whole school were at their places, with no books before them, and\narranged as if to hear a lecture. Mr. Blinkhorn alone was absent, for,\nnot liking these exhibitions, he had taken an opportunity of slipping\nout into the playground, round which he was now solemnly trotting at the\n\"double\" with elbows squared and head up; an exercise which he said was\nan excellent thing for the back and lungs. He had a habit of suddenly\nleaving the class he was taking to indulge in it for a few minutes,\nreturning breathless but refreshed.\n\nMr. Tinkler was at his seat, wearing that faint grin on his face with\nwhich he might have prepared to see a pig killed or a bull-fight, and\nall the boys fixed their eyes expectantly on Mr. Bultitude as he\nappeared at the doorway.\n\n\"Stand there, sir,\" said the Doctor, who was standing at his\nwriting-table in an attitude; \"out there in the middle, where your\nschoolfellows can see you.\" Paul obeyed and stood where he was told,\nlooking, as he felt, absolutely boneless.\n\n\"Some of those here,\" began the Doctor in an impressive bass, \"may\nwonder why I have called you all together on this, the first day of the\nweek; most of those who reside under my roof are acquainted with, and I\ntrust execrate, the miserable cause of my doing so.\n\n\"If there is one virtue which I have striven to implant more than any\nother in your breasts,\" he continued, \"it is the cultivation of a modest\nand becoming reserve in your intercourse with those of the opposite sex.\n\n\"With the majority I have, I hope, been successful, and it is as painful\nfor me to tell as for you to hear, that there exists in your midst a\nyouthful reprobate, trained in all the arts of ensnaring the vagrant\nfancies of innocent but giddy girlhood.\n\n\"See him as he cowers there before your gaze, in all the bared\nhideousness of his moral depravity\" (the Doctor on occasions like these\nnever spared his best epithets, and Paul soon began to feel himself a\nvery villain); \"a libertine, young in years, but old in--in everything\nelse, who has not scrupled to indite an amatory note, so appalling in\nits familiarity, and so outrageous in the warmth of its sentiments, that\nI cannot bring myself to shock your ears with its contents.\n\n\"You do well to shun him as a moral leper; but how shall I tell you\nthat, not satisfied with pressing his effusions upon the shrinking\nobject of his precocious affections, the impious wretch has availed\nhimself of the shelter of a church to cloak his insidious advances, and\neven force a response to them from a heedless and imprudent girl!\n\n\"If,\" continued the Doctor, now allowing his powerful voice to boom to\nits full compass--\"if I can succeed in bringing this coward, this\nunmanly dallier in a sentiment which the healthy mind of boyhood rejects\nas premature, to a sense of his detestable conduct; if I can score the\nlesson upon his flesh so that some faint notion of its force and purport\nmay be conveyed to what has been supplied to him as a heart, then I\nshall not have lifted this hand in vain!\n\n\"He shall see whether he will be allowed to trail the fair name of the\nschool for propriety and correctness of deportment in the dust of a\npew-floor, and spurn my reputation as a preceptor like a church hassock\nbeneath his feet!\n\n\"I shall say no more; I will not prolong these strictures, deserved\nthough they be, beyond their proper limits.... I shall now proceed to\nact. Richard Bultitude, remain there till I return to mete out to you\nwith no sparing hand the punishment you have so richly merited.\"\n\nWith these awful words the Doctor left the room, leaving Paul in a\nstate of abject horror and dread which need not be described. Never,\nnever again would he joke, as he had been wont to do with Dick in\nlighter moods, on the subject of corporal punishment under any\ncircumstances--it was no fit theme for levity; if this--this outrage\nwere really done to him, he could never be able to hold up his head\nagain. What if it were to get about in the city!\n\nThe boys, who had sunk, as they always did, into a state of torpid awe\nunder the Doctor's eloquence, now recovered spirits enough to rally Paul\nwith much sprightly humour.\n\n\"He's gone to fetch his cane,\" said some, and imitated for Paul's\ninstruction the action of caning by slapping a ruler upon a copy-book\nwith a dreadful fidelity and resonance; others sought to cross-examine\nhim upon the love-letter, it appearing from their casual remarks that\nnot a few had been also honoured by communications from the artless Miss\nDavenant.\n\nIt is astonishing how unfeeling even ordinary good-natured boys can be\nat times.\n\nChawner sat at his desk with raised shoulders, rubbing his hands, and\ngrinning like some malevolent ape: \"I told you, Dickie, you know,\" he\nmurmured, \"that it was better not to cross me.\"\n\nAnd still the Doctor lingered. Some kindly suggested that he was \"waxing\nthe cane.\" But the more general opinion was that he had been detained by\nsome visitor; for it appeared that (though Paul had not noticed it)\nseveral had heard a ring at the bell. The suspense was growing more and\nmore unbearable.\n\nAt last the door opened in a slow ominous manner, and the Doctor\nappeared. There was a visible change in his manner, however. The white\nheat of his indignation had died out: his expression was grave but\ndistinctly softened--and he had nothing in his hand.\n\n\"I want you outside, Bultitude,\" he said; and Paul, still uncertain\nwhether the scene of his disgrace was only about to be shifted, or what\nelse this might mean, followed him into the hall.\n\n\"If anything can strike shame and confusion into your soul, Richard,\"\nsaid the Doctor, when they were outside, \"it will be what I have to tell\nyou now. Your unhappy father is here, in the dining-room.\"\n\nPaul staggered. Had Dick the brazen effrontery to come here to taunt him\nin his slavery? What was the meaning of it? What should he say to him?\nHe could not answer the Doctor but by a vacant stare.\n\n\"I have not seen him yet,\" said the Doctor. \"He has come at a most\ninopportune moment\" (here Mr. Bultitude could _not_ agree with him). \"I\nshall allow you to meet him first, and give you the opportunity of\nbreaking your conduct to him. I know how it will wring his paternal\nheart!\" and the Doctor shook his head sadly, and turned away.\n\nWith a curious mixture of shame, anger, and impatience, Paul turned the\nhandle of the dining-room door. He was to meet Dick face to face once\nmore. The final duel must be fought out between them here. Who would be\nthe victor?\n\nIt was a strange sensation on entering to see the image of what he had\nso lately been standing by the mantelpiece. It gave a shock to his sense\nof his own identity. It seemed so impossible that that stout substantial\nframe could really contain Dick. For an instant he was totally at a loss\nfor words, and stood pale and speechless in the presence of his\nunprincipled son.\n\nDick on his side seemed at least as much embarrassed. He giggled\nuneasily, and made a sheepish offer to shake hands, which was\nindignantly declined.\n\nAs Paul looked he saw distinctly that his son's fraudulent imitation of\nhis father's personal appearance had become deteriorated in many\nrespects since that unhappy night when he had last seen it. It was then\na copy, faultlessly accurate in every detail. It was now almost a\ncaricature, a libel!\n\nThe complexion was nearly sallow, with the exception of the nose, which\nhad rather deepened in colour. The skin was loose and flabby, and the\neyes dull and a little bloodshot. But perhaps the greatest alteration\nwas in the dress. Dick wore an old light tweed shooting-coat of his, and\na pair of loose trousers of blue serge; while, instead of the formally\ntied black neckcloth his father had worn for a quarter of a century, he\nhad a large scarf round his neck of some crude and gaudy colour; and the\nconventional chimney-pot hat had been discarded for a shabby old\nwide-brimmed felt wideawake.\n\nAltogether, it was by no means the costume which a British merchant,\nwith any self-respect whatever, would select, even for a country visit.\n\nAnd thus they met, as perhaps never, since this world was first set\nspinning down the ringing grooves of change, met father and son before!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. _An Error of Judgment_\n\n     \"The Survivorship of a worthy Man in his Son is a Pleasure scarce\n     inferior to the Hopes of the Continuance of his own Life.\"\n                                                          _Spectator._\n\n\n     \"Du bist ein Knabe--sei es immerhin\n     Und fahre fort, den FrÃ¶hlichen zu spielen.\"\n                                   SCHILLER, _Don Carlos_.\n\n\nPaul was the first to break a very awkward silence. \"You young\nscoundrel!\" he said, with suppressed rage. \"What the devil do you mean\nby laughing like that? It's no laughing matter, let me tell you, sir,\nfor one of us!\"\n\n\"I can't help laughing,\" said Dick; \"you do look so queer!\"\n\n\"Queer! I may well look queer. I tell you that I have never, never in my\nwhole life, spent such a perfectly infernal week as this last!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" observed Dick, \"I thought you wouldn't find it _all_ jam! And yet\nyou seemed to be enjoying yourself, too,\" he said with a grin, \"from\nthat letter you wrote.\"\n\n\"What made you come here? Couldn't you be content with your miserable\nvictory, without coming down to crow and jeer at me?\"\n\n\"It isn't that,\" said Dick. \"I--I thought I should like to see the\nfellows, and find out how you were getting on, you know.\" These,\nhowever, were not his only and his principal motives. He had come down\nto get a sight of Dulcie.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Bultitude, with ponderous sarcasm, \"you'll be\ndelighted to hear that I'm getting on uncommonly well--oh, uncommonly!\nYour high-spirited young friends batter me to sleep with slippers on\nmost nights, and, as a general thing, kick me about during the day like\na confounded football! And last night, sir, I was going to be expelled;\nand this morning I'm forgiven, and sentenced to be soundly flogged\nbefore the whole school! It was just about to take place as you came in;\nand I've every reason to believe it is merely postponed!\"\n\n\"I say, though,\" said Dick, \"you must have been going it rather, you\nknow. I've never been expelled. Has Chawner been sneaking again? What\nhave you been up to?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I solemnly swear--nothing! They're finding out things you've\ndone, and thrashing _me_.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick soothingly, \"you'll work them all off during the term,\nI daresay. There aren't many really bad ones. I suppose he's seen my\nname cut on his writing-table?\"\n\n\"No; not that I'm aware of,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Oh, he'd let you hear of it if he had!\" said Dick. \"It's good for a\nswishing, that is. But, after all, what's a swishing? I never cared for\na swishing.\"\n\n\"But I do care, sir. I care very much, and, I tell you, I won't stand\nit. I can't! Dick,\" he said abruptly as a sudden hope seized him. \"You,\nyou haven't come down here to say you're tired of your folly, have you?\nDo you want to give it up?\"\n\n\"Rather not,\" said Dick. \"Why should I? No school, no lessons, nothing\nto do but amuse myself, eat and drink what I like, and lots of money.\nIt's not likely, you know.\"\n\n\"Have you ever thought that you're bringing yourself within reach of the\nlaw, sir?\" said Paul, trying to frighten him. \"Perhaps you don't know\nthat there's an offence known as 'false personation with intent to\ndefraud,' and that it's a felony. That's what you're doing at this\nmoment, sir!\"\n\n\"Not any more than you are!\" retorted Dick. \"I never began it. I had as\nmuch right to wish to be you as you had to wish to be me. You're just\nwhat you said you wanted to be, so you can't complain.\"\n\n\"It's useless to argue with you, I see,\" said Paul. \"And you've no\nfeelings. But I'll warn you of one thing. Whether that is my body or not\nyou've fraudulently taken possession of, I don't know; if it is not, it\nis very like mine, and I tell you this about it. The sort of life you're\nleading it, sir, will very soon make an end of you, if you don't take\ncare. Do you think that a constitution at my age can stand sweet wines\nand pastry, and late hours? Why, you'll be laid up with gout in another\nday or two. Don't tell me, sir. I know you're suffering from indigestion\nat this very minute. I can see your liver (it may be _my_ liver for\nanything I know) is out of order. I can see it in your eyes.\"\n\nDick was a little alarmed at this, but he soon said: \"Well, and if I am\nseedy, I can get Barbara to take the stone and wish me all right again,\ncan't I? That's easy enough, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, easy enough!\" said Paul, with a suppressed groan. \"But, Dick, you\ndon't go up to Mincing Lane in that suit and that hat? Don't tell me you\ndo that!\"\n\n\"When I do go up, I wear them,\" said Dick composedly. \"Why not? It's a\nroomy suit, and I hate a great topper on my head; I've had enough of\nthat here on Sundays. But it's slow up at your office. The chaps there\naren't half up to any larks. I made a first-rate booby-trap, though, one\nday for an old yellow buffer who came in to see you. He _was_ in a bait\nwhen he found the waste-paper basket on his head!\"\n\n\"What was his name?\" said Paul, with forced calm.\n\n\"Something like 'Shells.' He said he was a very old friend of mine, and\nI told him he lied.\"\n\n\"Shellack--my Canton correspondent--a man I was anxious to be of use\nto when he came over!\" moaned Mr. Bultitude. \"Miserable young cub, you\ndon't know what mischief you've done!\"\n\n\"Well, it won't matter much to you now,\" said Dick; \"you're out of it\nall.\"\n\n\"Do you--do you mean to keep me out of it for ever, then?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"As long as ever I can!\" returned Dick frankly. \"It will be rather\ninteresting to see what sort of a fellow you'll grow into--if you ever\ndo grow. Perhaps you will always be like that, you know. This magic is a\nrum thing to meddle with.\"\n\nThis suggestion almost maddened Paul. He made one stride forward, and\nfaced his son with blazing eyes. \"Do you think I will put up with it?\"\nhe said, between his teeth. \"Do you suppose I shall stand calmly by and\nsee you degrading and ruining me? I may never be my old self again, but\nI don't mean to play into your hands for all that. You can't always keep\nme here, and wherever I go I'll tell my tale. I know you, you clumsy\nrogue, you haven't the sense to play your part with common intelligence\nnow. You would betray yourself directly I challenged you to deny my\nstory.... You know you would.... You couldn't face me for five minutes.\nBy Gad! I'll do it now. I'll expose you before the Doctor--before the\nwhole school. You shall see if you can dispose of me quite so easily as\nyou imagine!\"\n\nDick had started back at first in unmistakable alarm at this unexpected\ndefiance, probably feeling his self-possession unequal to such a test;\nbut, when Paul had finished, he said doggedly: \"Well, you can do it if\nyou choose, I suppose. I can't stop you. But I don't see what good it\nwould do.\"\n\n\"It would show people you were an impudent impostor, sir,\" said Paul\nsternly, going to the door as if to call the Doctor, though he shrank\nsecretly from so extreme and dangerous a measure.\n\nThere was a hesitation in his manner, in spite of the firmness of his\nwords, which Dick was not likely to miss. \"Stop!\" he said. \"Before you\ncall them in, just listen to me for a minute. Do you see this?\" And,\nopening his coat, he pulled out from his waistcoat pocket one end of his\nwatch-chain. Hanging to it, attached by a cheap gilt fastening of some\nsort, was a small grey tablet. Paul knew it at once--it was the GarudÃ¢\nStone. \"You know it, I see,\" said Dick, as Paul was about to move\ntowards him--with what object he scarcely knew himself. \"Don't trouble\nto come any closer. Well, I give you fair warning. You can make things\nvery nasty for me if you like. I can't help that--but, if you do--if you\ntry to score off me in any way, now or at any time--if you don't keep it\nup when the Doctor comes in--I tell you what I shall do. I shall go\nstraight home and find young Roly. I shall give him this stone, and just\ntell him to say some wish after me. I don't believe there are many\nthings it can't do, and all I can say is--if you find yourself and all\nthis jolly old school (except Dulcie) taken off somewhere and stuck down\nall at once thousands of miles away on a desolate island, or see\nyourself turned into a Red Indian, or, or a cabhorse, you'll have\nyourself to thank for it--that's all. Now you can have them all up and\nfire away.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul, in a broken voice, for, wild as the threat was, he\ncould not afford to despise it after his experiences of the stone's\npower, \"I--I was joking, Dick; at least I didn't mean it. I know of\ncourse I'm helpless. It's a sad thing for a father to say, but you've\ngot the best of it.... I give in ... I won't interfere with you. There's\nonly one thing I ask. You won't try any more experiments with that\nmiserable stone.... You'll promise me that, at least?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick: \"it's all right. I'll play fair. As long as you behave\nyourself and back me up I won't touch it. I only want to stay as I am. I\ndon't want to hurt you.\"\n\n\"You won't lose it?\" said Paul anxiously. \"Couldn't you lock it up? that\nfastening doesn't look very safe.\"\n\n\"It will do well enough,\" said Dick. \"I got it done at the watchmaker's\nround the corner, for sixpence. But I'll have a stronger ring put in\nsomewhere, if I think of it.\"\n\nThere was a pause, in which the conversation seemed about to flag\nhopelessly, but at last Dick said, almost as if he felt some compunction\nfor his present unfilial attitude: \"Now, you know, it's much better to\ntake things quietly. It can't be altered now, can it? And it's not such\nbad fun being a boy after all--for some things. You'll get into it\nby-and-by, you see if you don't, and be as jolly as a sandboy. We shall\nget along all right together, too. I shan't be hard on you. It isn't my\nfault that you happen to be at this particular school--you chose it! And\nafter this term you can go to any other school you like--Eton or Rugby,\nor anywhere. I don't mind the expense. Of, if you'd rather, you can have\na private tutor. And I'll buy you a pony, and you can ride in the Row.\nYou shall have a much better time of it than I ever had, as long as you\nlet me go on my own way.\"\n\nBut these dazzling bribes had no influence upon Mr. Bultitude; nothing\nshort of complete restitution would ever satisfy him, and he was too\nproud and too angry at his crushing defeat to even pretend to be in the\nleast pacified.\n\n\"I don't want your pony,\" he said bitterly; \"I might as well have a\nwhite elephant, and I don't suppose I should enjoy myself much more at a\npublic school than I do here. Let's have no humbug, sir. You're up and\nI'm down--there's no more to be said--I shall tell the Doctor nothing,\nbut I warn you, if ever the time comes----\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" said Dick, feeling tolerably secure, now he had\ndisposed of the main difficulty. \"If you can turn me out, I suppose you\nwill--that's only fair. I shall take care not to give you the chance.\nAnd, oh, I say, do you want any tin? How much have you got left?\"\n\nPaul turned away his head, lest Dick should see the sudden exultation he\nknew it must betray, as he said, with an effort to appear unconcerned,\n\"I came away with exactly five shillings, and I haven't a penny now!\"\n\n\"I say,\" said Dick, \"you are a fellow; you must have been going it. How\ndid you get rid of it all in a week?\"\n\n\"It went, as far as I can understand,\" said Mr. Bultitude, \"in rabbits\nand mice. Some boys claimed it as money they paid you to get them, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"All your own fault,\" said Dick, \"you would have them drowned. But you'd\nbetter have some tin to get along with. How much do you want? Will\nhalf-a-crown do?\"\n\n\"Half-a-crown is not much, Dick,\" said his father, almost humbly.\n\n\"It's--ahem--a handsome allowance for a young fellow like you,\" said\nDick, rather unkindly; \"but I haven't any half-crowns left. I must give\nyou this, I suppose.\"\n\nAnd he held out a sovereign, never dreaming what it signified to Paul,\nwho clutched it with feelings too great for words, though gratitude was\nnot a part of them, for was it not his own money?\n\n\"And now look out,\" said Dick, \"I hear Grim. Remember what I told you;\nkeep it up.\"\n\nDr. Grimstone came in with the air of a man who has a painful duty to\nperform; he started slightly as his eye noted the change in his\nvisitor's dress and appearance. \"I hope,\" he began gravely, \"that your\nson has spared me the pain of going into the details of his\nmisbehaviour; I wish I could give you a better report of him.\"\n\nDick was plainly, in spite of his altered circumstances, by no means at\nease in the schoolmaster's presence; he stood, shifting from foot to\nfoot on the hearth-rug, turning extremely red and obstinately declining\nto raise his eyes from the ground.\n\n\"Oh, ah,\" he stammered at last, \"you were just going to swish him,\nweren't you, when I turned up, sir?\"\n\n\"I found myself forced,\" said the Doctor, slightly shocked at this\ncoarse way of putting things, \"forced to contemplate administering to\nhim (for his ultimate benefit) a sharp corrective in the presence of his\nschoolfellows. I distress you, I see, but the truth must be told. He has\nno doubt confessed his fault to you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dick, \"he hasn't though. What's he been up to now?\"\n\n\"I had hoped he would have been more open, more straightforward, when\nconfronted with the father who has proved himself so often indulgent and\nanxious for his improvement; it would have been a more favourable\nsymptom, I think. Well, I must tell you myself. I know too well what a\nshock it will be to your scrupulously sensitive moral code, my dear Mr.\nBultitude\" (Dick showed a painful inclination to giggle here); \"but I\nhave to break to you the melancholy truth that I detected this unhappy\nboy in the act of conducting a secret and amorous correspondence with a\nyoung lady in a sacred edifice!\"\n\nDick whistled sharply: \"Oh, I say!\" he cried, \"that's bad\" (and he\nwagged his head reprovingly at his disgusted father, who longed to\ndenounce his hypocrisy, but dared not); \"that's bad ... he shouldn't do\nthat sort of thing you know, should he? At his age too ... the young\ndog!\"\n\n\"This horror is what I should have expected from you,\" said the Doctor\n(though he was in truth more than scandalised by the composure with\nwhich his announcement was received). \"Such boldness is indeed\ncharacteristic of the dog, an animal which, as you are aware, was with\nthe ancients a synonym for shamelessness. No boy, however abandoned,\nshould hear such words of unequivocal condemnation from a father's lips\nwithout a pang of shame!\"\n\nPaul was only just able to control his rage by a great effort.\n\n\"You're right there, sir,\" said Dick; \"he ought to be well ragged for it\n... he'll break my heart, if he goes on like this, the young beggar. But\nwe mustn't be too hard on him, eh? After all, it's nature, you know,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Dr. Grimstone very stiffly.\n\n\"I mean,\" explained Dick, with a perilous approach to digging the other\nin the ribs, \"we did much the same sort of thing in our time, eh? I'm\nsure I did--lots of times!\"\n\n\"I can't reproach myself on that head, Mr. Bultitude; and permit me to\nsay, that such a tone of treating the affair is apt to destroy the\neffect, the excellent moral effect, of your most impressively conveyed\nindignation just now. I merely give you a hint, you understand!\"\n\n\"Oh, ah,\" said Dick, feeling that he had made a mistake, \"yes, I didn't\nmean that. But I say, you haven't given him a--a whopping yet, have\nyou?\"\n\n\"I had just stepped out to procure a cane for that purpose,\" said the\nDoctor, \"when your name was announced.\"\n\n\"Well, look here, you won't want to start again when I'm gone, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"An ancient philosopher, my dear sir, was accustomed to postpone the\ncorrection of his slaves until the first glow of his indignation had\npassed away. He found that he could----\"\n\n\"Lay it on with more science,\" suggested Dick, while Paul writhed where\nhe stood. \"Perhaps so, but you might forgive him now, don't you think?\nhe won't do it again. If he goes writing any more love-letters, tell me,\nand I'll come and talk to him; but he's had a lesson, you know. Let him\noff this time.\"\n\n\"I have no right to resist such an entreaty,\" said the Doctor, \"though I\nmay be inclined myself to think that a few strokes would render the\nlesson more permanent. I must ask you to reconsider your plea for his\npardon.\"\n\nPaul heard this with indescribable anxiety; he had begun to feel\ntolerably sure that his evil hour was postponed _sine die_, but might\nnot Dick be cruel and selfish enough to remain neutral, or even side\nwith the enemy, in support of his assumed character?\n\nLuckily he was not. \"I'd rather let him off,\" he said awkwardly; \"I\ndon't approve of caning fellows myself. It never did me any good, I\nknow, and I got enough of it to tell.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I yield. Richard, your father has interceded for you; and I\ncannot disregard his wishes, though I have my own view in the matter.\nYou will hear no more of this disgraceful conduct, sir, unless you do\nsomething to recall it to my memory. Thank your father for his kindness,\nwhich you so little deserved, and take your leave of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, there, it's all right!\" said Dick; \"he'll behave himself after\nthis, I know. And oh! I say, sir,\" he added hastily, \"is--is Dulcie\nanywhere about?\"\n\n\"My daughter?\" asked the Doctor. \"Would you like to see her?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind,\" said Dick, blushing furiously.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say she has gone out for a walk with her mother,\" said the\nDoctor. \"I'm afraid she cannot be back for some time. It's unfortunate.\"\n\nDick's face fell. \"It doesn't matter,\" he muttered awkwardly. \"She's\nall right, I hope?\"\n\n\"She is very seldom ailing, I'm happy to say; just now she is\nparticularly well, thank you.\"\n\n\"Oh, is she?\" said Dick gloomily, probably disappointed to find that he\nwas so little missed, and not suspecting that his father had been\naccepted as a substitute.\n\n\"Well, do you mind--could I see the fellows again for a minute or two--I\nmean I should rather like to inspect the school, you know.\"\n\n\"See my boys? Certainly, my dear sir, by all means; this way,\" and he\ntook Dick out to the schoolroom--Paul following out of curiosity.\n\"You'll find us at our studies, you see,\" said the Doctor, as he opened\nthe first baize door. There was a suspicious hubbub and hum of voices\nfrom within; but as they entered every boy was bent over his books with\nthe rapt absorption of the devoted student--an absorption that was the\ndirect effect of the sound the door-handle made in turning.\n\n\"Our workshop,\" said the Doctor airily, looking round. \"My first form,\nMr. Bultitude. Some good workers here, and some idle ones.\"\n\nDick stood in the doorway, looking (if the truth must be told)\nuncommonly foolish. He had wanted, in coming there, to enjoy the\ncontrast between the past and present--which accounts for a good many\nvisits of \"old boys\" to the scene of their education. But, confronted\nwith his former schoolfellows, he was seized at first with an utterly\nunreasonable fear of detection.\n\nThe class behaved as classes usually do on such occasions. The good boys\nsmirked and the bad ones stared--the general expression being one of\nuneasy curiosity. Dick said never a word, feeling strangely bashful and\nnervous.\n\n\"This is Tipping, my head boy,\" touching that young gentleman on the\nshoulder, and making him several degrees more uncomfortable. \"I expect\nsolid results from Tipping some day.\"\n\n\"He looks as if his head was pretty solid,\" said Dick, who had once cut\nhis knuckles against it.\n\n\"My second boy, Biddlecomb. If he applies himself, he too will do me\ncredit in the world.\"\n\n\"How do, Biddlecomb?\" said Dick. \"I owe you ninepence--I mean--oh hang\nit, here's a shilling for you! Hallo, Chawner!\" he went on, gradually\novercoming his first nervousness, \"how are you getting on, eh? Doing\nmuch in the sneaking way lately?\"\n\n\"You know him!\" exclaimed the Doctor with naive surprise.\n\n\"No, no; I don't know him. I've heard of him, you know--heard of him!\"\nChawner looked down his nose with a feeble attempt at a gratified\nsimper, while his neighbours giggled with furtive relish.\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick at last, after a long look at all the old familiar\nobjects, \"I must be off, you know. Got some important business at home\nthis evening to look after. The fellows look very jolly and contented,\nand all that sort of thing. Enough to make one want to be a boy again\nalmost, eh? Good-bye, you chaps--ahem, young gentlemen, I wish you good\nmorning!\"\n\nAnd he went out, leaving behind him the impression that \"young\nBultitude's governor wasn't half such a bad old buffer.\"\n\nHe paused at the open front door, to which Paul and the Doctor had\naccompanied him. \"Good-bye,\" he said; \"I wish I'd seen Dulcie. I should\nlike to see your daughter, sir; but it can't be helped. Good-bye; and\nyou,\" he added in a lower tone to his father, who was standing by,\ninexpressibly pained and disgusted by his utter want of dignity, \"you\nmind what I told you. Don't try any games with me!\"\n\nAnd, as he skipped jauntily down the steps to the gateway, the Doctor\nfollowed his unwieldy, oddly-dressed form with his eyes, and, inclining\nhis head gravely to Dick's sweeping wave of the hand, asked with a\ncompassionate tone in his voice. \"You don't happen to know, Richard, my\nboy, if your father has had any business troubles lately--anything to\ndisturb him?\"\n\nAnd Mr. Bultitude's feelings prevented him from making any intelligible\nreply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. _The Rubicon_\n\n                       \"My three schoolfellows,\n     Whom I will trust--as I will adders fanged;\n     They bear the mandate.\"\n\n\nPaul never quite knew how the remainder of that day passed at Crichton\nHouse. He was ordered to join a class which was more or less engaged\nwith some kind of work: he had a hazy idea that it was Latin, though it\nmay have been Greek; but he was spared the necessity of taking any\nactive part in the proceedings, as Mr. Blinkhorn was not disposed to be\ntoo exacting with a boy who in one short morning had endured a sentence\nof expulsion, a lecture, the immediate prospect of a flogging, and a\npaternal visit, and, as before, mercifully left him alone.\n\nHis classmates, however, did not show the same chivalrous delicacy; and\nPaul had to suffer many unmannerly jests and gibes at his expense,\nfrequent and anxious inquiries as to the exact nature of his treatment\nin the dining-room, with sundry highly imaginative versions of the same,\nwhile there was much candid and unbiassed comment on the appearance and\nconduct of himself and his son.\n\nBut he bore it unprotesting--or, rather, he scarcely noticed it; for all\nhis thoughts were now entirely taken up by one important subject--the\ntime and manner of his escape.\n\nThanks to Dick's thoughtless liberality, he had now ample funds to carry\nhim safely home. It was hardly likely that any more unexpected claims\ncould be brought against him now, particularly as he had no intention\nof publishing his return to solvency. He might reasonably consider\nhimself in a position to make his escape at the very first favourable\nopportunity.\n\nWhen would that opportunity present itself? It must come soon. He could\nnot wait long for it. Any hour might yet see him pounced upon and\nflogged heartily for some utterly unknown and unsuspected transgression;\nor the golden key which would unlock his prison bars might be lost in\nsome unlucky moment; for his long series of reverses had made him loth\nto trust to Fortune, even when she seemed to look smilingly once more\nupon him.\n\nFortune's countenance is apt to be so alarmingly mobile with some\nunfortunates.\n\nBut in spite of the new facilities given him for escape, and his strong\nmotives for taking advantage of them, he soon found to his utter dismay\nthat he shrank from committing himself to so daring and dangerous a\ncourse, just as much as when he had tried to make a confidant of the\nDoctor.\n\nFor, after all, could he be sure of himself? Would his ill-luck suffer\nhim to seize the one propitious moment, or would that fatal\nself-distrust and doubt that had paralysed him for the past week seize\nhim again just at the crisis?\n\nSuppose he did venture to take the first irrevocable step, could he rely\non himself to go through the rest of his hazardous enterprise? Was he\ncool and wary enough? He dared not expect an uninterrupted run. Had he\nruses and expedients at command on any sudden check?\n\nIf he could not answer all these doubts favourably, was it not sheer\nmadness to take to flight at all?\n\nHe felt a dismal conviction that his success would have to depend, not\non his own cunning, but on the forbearance or blindness of others. The\nslightest _contretemps_ must infallibly upset him altogether.\n\nThe fact was, he had all his life been engaged in the less eventful and\ncontentious branches of commerce. His will had seldom had to come in\ncontact with others, and when it did so, he had found means, being of a\nprudent and cautious temperament, of avoiding disagreeable personal\nconsequences by timely compromises or judicious employment of delegates.\nHe had generally found his fellow-men ready to meet him reasonably as an\nequal or a superior.\n\nBut now he must be prepared to see in everyone he met a possible enemy,\nwho would hand him over to the tyrant on the faintest suspicion. They\nwere spies to be baffled or disarmed, pursuers to be eluded. The\nsmallest slip in his account of himself would be enough to undo him.\n\nNo wonder that, as he thought over all this, his heart quailed within\nhim.\n\nThey say--the paradox-mongers say--that it requires a far higher degree\nof moral courage for a soldier in action to leave the ranks under fire\nand seek a less distinguished position towards the rear, than would\ncarry him on with the rest to charge a battery.\n\nThis may be true, though it might not prove a very valuable defence at a\ncourt-martial; but, at all events, Mr. Bultitude found, when it came to\nthe point, that it was almost impossible for him to screw up his courage\nto run away.\n\nIt is not a pleasant state, this indecision whether to stay passively\nand risk the worst or avoid it by flight, and the worst of it is that,\nwhatever course is eventually forced upon us, it finds us equally\nunprepared, and more liable from such indecision to bungle miserably in\nthe sequel.\n\nPaul might never have gained heart to venture, but for an unpleasant\nincident that took place during dinner and a discovery he made after it.\n\nThey happened to have a particularly unpopular pudding that day; a\npallid preparation of suet, with an infrequent currant or two embalmed\nin it, and Paul was staring at his portion of this delicacy\ndisconsolately enough, wondering how he should contrive to consume and,\nworse still, digest it, when his attention was caught by Jolland, who\nsat directly opposite him.\n\nThat young gentleman, who evidently shared the general prejudice against\nthe currant pudding, was inviting Mr. Bultitude's attention to a little\ncontrivance of his own for getting rid of it, which consisted in\ndelicately shovelling the greater part of what was on his plate into a\nlarge envelope held below the table to receive it.\n\nThis struck Paul as a heaven-sent method of avoiding the difficulty, and\nhe had just got the envelope which had held Barbara's letter out of his\npocket, intending to follow Jolland's example, when the Doctor's voice\nmade him start guiltily and replace the envelope in his pocket.\n\n\"Jolland,\" said the Doctor, \"what have you got there?\"\n\n\"An envelope, sir,\" explained Jolland, who had now got the remains of\nhis pudding safely bestowed.\n\n\"What is in that envelope?\" said the Doctor, who happened to have been\nwatching him.\n\n\"In the envelope, sir? Pudding, sir,\" said Jolland, as if it were the\nmost natural thing in the world to send bulky portions of pudding by\npost.\n\n\"And why did you place pudding in the envelope?\" inquired the Doctor in\nhis deepest tone.\n\nJolland felt a difficulty in explaining that he had done so because he\nwished to avoid eating it, and with a view to interring it later on in\nthe playground: he preferred silence.\n\n\"Shall I tell you why you did it, sir?\" thundered the Doctor. \"You did\nit, because you were scheming to obtain a second portion--because you\ndid not feel yourself able to eat both portions at your leisure here,\nand thought to put by a part to devour in secret at a future time. It's\na most painful exhibition of pure piggishness. There shall be no\npocketing at this table, sir. You will eat that pudding under my eye at\nonce, and you will stay in and write out French verbs for two days. That\nwill put an end to any more gorging in the garden for a time, at least.\"\n\nJolland seemed stupefied, though relieved, by the unexpected\nconstruction put upon his conduct, as he gulped down the intercepted\nfragments of pudding, while the rest diligently cleared their plates\nwith as much show of appreciation as they could muster.\n\nMr. Bultitude shuddered at this one more narrow escape. If he had been\ndetected--as he must have been in another instant--in smuggling pudding\nin an envelope he might have incautiously betrayed his real motives, and\nthen, as the Doctor was morbidly sensitive concerning all complaints of\nthe fare he provided, he would have got into worse trouble than the\nunfortunate Jolland, to say nothing of the humiliation of being detected\nin such an act.\n\nIt was a solemn warning to him of the dangers he was exposed to hourly,\nwhile he lingered within those walls; but his position was still more\nstrongly brought home to him by the terrible discovery he made shortly\nafterwards.\n\nHe was alone in the schoolroom, for the others had all gone down into\nthe playground, except Jolland, who was confined in one of the\nclass-rooms below, when the thought came over him to test the truth of\nDick's hint about a name cut on the Doctor's writing-table.\n\nHe stole up to it guiltily, and, lifting the slanting desk which stood\nthere, examined the surface below. Dick had been perfectly correct.\nThere it was, glaringly fresh and distinct, not large but very deeply\ncut and fearfully legible. \"R. Bultitude.\" It might have been done that\nday. Dick had probably performed it out of bravado, or under the\nimpression that he was not going to return after the holidays.\n\nPaul dropped the desk over the fatal letters with a shudder. The\nslightest accidental shifting of it must disclose them--nothing but a\nmiracle could have kept them concealed so long. When they did come to\nlight, he knew from what he had seen of the Doctor, that the act would\nbe considered as an outrage of the blackest and most desperate kind. He\nwould most unquestionably get a flogging for it!\n\nHe fetched a large pewter ink-pot, and tried nervously to blacken the\nletters with the tip of a quill, to make them, if possible, rather less\nobtrusive than they were. All in vain; they only stood out with more\nstartling vividness when picked out in black upon the brown-stained\ndeal. He felt very like a conscience-stricken murderer trying to hide a\ncorpse that _wouldn't_ be buried. He gave it up at last, having only\nmade a terrible mess with the ink.\n\nThat settled it. He must fly. The flogging must be avoided at all\nhazards. If an opportunity delayed its coming, why, he must do without\nthe opportunity--he must make one. For good or ill, his mind was made up\nnow for immediate flight.\n\nAll that afternoon, while he sat trying to keep his mind upon long sums\nin Bills of Parcels, which disgusted him as a business man, by the\nglaring improbability of their details, his eye wandered furtively down\nthe long tables to where the Doctor sat at the head of the class. Every\nchance movement of the principal's elbow filled him with a sickening\ndread. A hundred times did those rudely carved letters seem about to\nstart forth and denounce him.\n\nIt was a disquieting afternoon for Paul.\n\nBut the time dragged wearily on, and still the desk loyally kept its\nsecret. The dusk drew on and the gas-burners were lit. The younger boys\ncame up from the lower class-room and were sent out to play; the Doctor\nshortly afterwards dismissed his own class to follow them, and Paul and\nhis companions had the room to themselves.\n\nHe sat there on the rough form with his slate before him, hearing\nhalf-unconsciously the shouts, laughter, and ring of feet coming up from\nthe darkness outside, and the faint notes of a piano, which filtered\nthrough the double doors from one of the rooms, where a boy was\npractising Haydn's \"Surprise,\" from Hamilton's exercise book, a surprise\nwhich he rendered as a mildly interjectional form of astonishment.\n\nAll the time Paul was racked with an intense burning desire to get up\nand run for it then, before it became too late; but cold fits of doubt\nand fear preserved him from such lunacy--he would wait, his chance might\ncome before long.\n\nHis patience was rewarded; the Doctor came in, looking at his watch, and\nsaid, \"I think these boys have had enough of it, Mr. Tinkler, eh? You\ncan send them out now till tea-time.\"\n\nMr. Tinkler, who had been entangling himself frightfully in intricate\ncalculations upon the blackboard, without making a single convert, was\nonly too glad to take advantage of the suggestion, and Paul followed the\nrest into the playground with a sense of relief.\n\nThe usual \"chevy\" was going on there, with more spirit than usual,\nperhaps, because the darkness allowed of practical jokes and surprises,\nand offered great facilities for paying off old grudges with secrecy and\ndespatch, and as the Doctor had come to the door of the greenhouse, and\nwas looking on, the players exerted themselves still more, till the\n\"prison\" to which most of one side had been consigned by being run down\nand touched by their fleeter enemies was filled with a long line of\ncaptives holding hands and calling out to be released.\n\nPaul, who had run out vaguely from his base, was promptly pursued and\nmade prisoner by an unnecessarily vigorous thump in the back, after\nwhich he took his place at the bottom of the line of imprisoned ones.\n\nBut the enemy's spirit began to slacken; one after another of the\nplayers still left to the opposite side succeeded in outrunning pursuit\nand touching the foremost prisoner for the time being, so as to set him\nfree by the rules of the game. The Doctor went in again, and the enemy\nrelapsed as usual into total indifference, so that Paul, without exactly\nknowing how, soon found himself the only one left in gaol, unnoticed and\napparently forgotten.\n\nHe could not see anything through the darkness, but he heard the voices\nof the boys disputing at the other side of the playground; he looked\nround; at his right was the indistinct form of a large laurel bush,\nbehind that he knew was the playground gate. Could it be that his chance\nhad come at last?\n\nHe slipped behind the laurel and waited, holding his breath; the dispute\nstill went on; no one seemed to have noticed him, probably the darkness\nprevented all chance of that; he went on tip-toe to the gate--it was not\nlocked.\n\nHe opened it very carefully a little way; it was forbearing enough not\nto creak, and the next moment he was outside, free to go where he would!\n\nEscape, after all, was simple enough when he came to try it; he could\nhardly believe at first that he really was free at last; free with money\nenough in his pocket to take him home, with the friendly darkness to\ncover his retreat; free to go back and confront Dick on his own ground,\nand, by force, or fraud, get the GarudÃ¢ Stone into his own hands once\nmore.\n\nAs yet he never doubted that it would be easy enough to convince his\nhousehold, if necessary, of the truth of his story, and enlist them one\nand all on his side; all that he required, he thought, was caution; he\nmust reach the house unobserved, and wait and watch, and the deuce would\nbe in it if the stone were not safe in his pocket again before twelve\nhours had gone by.\n\nAll this time he was still within a hundred yards or so of the\nplayground wall; he must decide upon some particular route, some\ndefinite method of ordering his flight; to stay where he was any longer\nwould clearly be unwise, yet, where should he go first?\n\nIf he went to the station at once, how could he tell that he should be\nlucky enough to catch a train without having to wait long for it, and\nunless he did that, he would almost certainly be sought for first on the\nstation platform, and might be caught before a train was due?\n\nAt last, with an astuteness he had not suspected himself of possessing,\nwhich was probably the result of the harrowing experiences he had lately\nundergone, he hit upon a plan of action. \"I'll go to a shop,\" he\nthought, \"and change this sovereign, and ask to look at a\ntimetable--then, if I find I can catch a train at once, I'll run for it;\nif one is not due for some time, I can hang about near the station till\nit comes in.\"\n\nWith this intention he walked on towards the town till he came to a\nsmall terrace of shops, when he went into the first, which was a\nstationer's and toy-dealer's, with a stock in trade of cheap wooden toys\nand incomprehensible games, drawing slates, penny packets of stationery\nand cards of pen and pencil-holders, and a particularly stuffy\natmosphere; the proprietor, a short man with a fat white face with a\nrich glaze all over it and a fringe of ragged brown whisker meeting\nunder his chin, was sitting behind the counter posting up his ledger.\n\nPaul looked round the shop in search of something to purchase, and at\nlast said, more nervously than he expected to do, \"I want a pencil-case,\none which screws up and down.\" He thought a pencil-case would be an\ninnocent, unsuspicious thing to ask for. The man set rows of cards\ncontaining pencil-cases of every imaginable shape on the counter before\nhim, and when Mr. Bultitude had chosen and paid for one, the stationer\nasked if there would be anything else, and if he might send it for him.\n\"You're one of Dr. Grimstone's young gentlemen up at Crichton House,\naren't you, sir?\" he added.\n\nA guilty dread of discovery made Paul anxious to deny this at once.\n\"No,\" he said; \"oh no; no connection with the place. Ah, could you allow\nme to look at a time-table?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir; expectin' some one to-night or to-morrow p'raps. Let me\nsee,\" he said, consulting a table which hung behind him. \"There's a\ntrain from Pancras comes in in half an hour from now, 6.5 that is;\nthere's another doo at 8.15, and one at 9.30. Then from Liverpool Street\nthey run----\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Bultitude, \"but--but I want the up-trains.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the man, with a rather peculiar intonation, \"I thought maybe\nyour par or mar was comin' down. Ain't Dr. Grimstone got the times the\ntrains go?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Paul desperately, without very well knowing what he said,\n\"yes, he has, but ah, not for this month; he--he sent me to inquire.\"\n\n\"Did he though?\" said the stationer. \"I thought you wasn't one of his\nyoung gentlemen?\"\n\nMr. Bultitude saw what a fearful trap he had fallen into and stood\nspeechless.\n\n\"Go along with you!\" said the little stationer at last, with a not\nunkindly grin. \"Lor bless you, I knew your face the minnit you come in.\nTo go and tell me a brazen story like that! You're a young pickle, you\nare!\"\n\nMr. Bultitude began to shuffle feebly towards the door. \"Pickle, eh?\" he\nprotested in great discomposure. \"No, no. Heaven knows I'm no pickle.\nIt's of no consequence about those trains. Don't trouble. Good evening\nto you.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said the man, \"don't be in such a nurry now. You tell me what\nyou want to know straightforward, and I don't mean to say as I won't\nhelp you so far as I can. Don't be afraid of my telling no tales. I've\nbin a schoolboy myself in my time, bless your 'art. I shouldn't wonder\nnow if I couldn't make a pretty good guess without telling at what\nyou're after. You've bin a catchin' of it hot, and you want to make a\nclean bolt of it. I ain't very far off, now, am I?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul; for something in the man's manner inspired confidence.\n\"I do want to make a bolt of it. I've been most abominably treated.\"\n\n\"Well, look here, I ain't got no right to interfere; and if you're\ncaught, I look to you not to bring my name in. I don't want to get into\ntrouble up at Crichton House and lose good customers, you see. But I\nlike the looks of you, and you've always dealt 'ere pretty regular. I\ndon't mind if I give you a lift. Just see here. You want to get off to\nLondon, don't you? What for is your business, not mine. Well, there's a\ntrain, express, stops at only one station on the way, in at 5.50. It's\ntwenty minnits to six now. If you take that road just oppersite, it'll\nbring you out at the end of the Station Road; you can do it easy in ten\nminnits and have time to spare. So cut away, and good luck to you?\"\n\n\"I'm vastly obliged to you,\" said Paul, and he meant it. It was a new\nexperience to find anyone offering him assistance. He left the close\nlittle shop, crossed the road, and started off in the direction\nindicated to him at a brisk trot.\n\nHis steps rang out cheerfully on the path ironbound with frost. He was\nalmost happy again under the exhilarating glow of unusual exercise and\nthe excitement of escape and regained freedom.\n\nHe ran on, past a series of villa residences enclosed in varnished\npalings and adorned with that mediÃ¦val abundance of turrets, balconies,\nand cheap stained-glass, which is accepted nowadays as a guarantee of\nthe tenant's culture, and a satisfactory substitute for effective\ndrainage. After the villas came a church, and a few yards farther on the\nroad turned with a sharp curve into the main thoroughfare leading to the\nstation.\n\nHe was so near it that he could hear the shrill engine whistles, and the\nbanging of trucks on the railway sidings echoed sharply from the\nneighbouring houses. He was saved, in sight of haven at last!\n\nFull of delight at the thought, he put on a still greater pace, and\nturning the corner without looking, ran into a little party of three,\nwhich was coming in the opposite direction.\n\nFate's vein of irony was by no means worked out yet. As he was\nrecovering from the collision, and preparing to offer or accept an\napology, as the case might be, he discovered to his horror that he had\nfallen amongst no strangers.\n\nThe three were his old acquaintances, Coker, Coggs, and the virtuous\nChawner--of whom he had fondly hoped to have seen the last for ever!\n\nThe moral and physical shock of such an encounter took all Mr.\nBultitude's remaining breath away. He stood panting under the sickly\nrays of a street-lamp, the very incarnation of helpless, hopeless\ndismay.\n\n\"Hallo!\" said Coker, \"it's young Bultitude!\"\n\n\"What do you mean by cannoning into a fellow like this?\" said Coggs.\n\"What are you up to out here, eh?\"\n\n\"If it comes to that,\" said Paul, casting about for some explanation of\nhis appearance, \"what are you up to here?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Chawner, \"if you want to know, Dick, we've been to fetch the\n_St. James' Gazette_ for the Doctor. He said I might go if I liked, and\nI asked for Coker and Coggs to come too; because there was something I\nwanted to tell them, very important, and I have told them, haven't I,\nCorny?\"\n\nCoggs growled sulkily; Coker gave a tragic groan, and said: \"I don't\ncare when you tell, Chawner. Do it to-night if you like. Let's talk\nabout something else. Bultitude hasn't told us yet how he came out here\nafter us.\"\n\nHis last words suggested a pretext to Paul, of which he hastened to make\nuse. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I? I came out here, after you, to say that Dr.\nGrimstone will not require the _St. James' Gazette_. He wants the\n_Globe_ and, ah, the _Star_ instead.\"\n\nIt did not sound a very probable combination; but Paul used the first\nnames that occurred to him, and, as it happened, aroused no suspicions,\nfor the boys read no newspapers.\n\n\"Well, we've got the other now,\" said Coker. \"We shall have to go back\nand get the fellow at the bookstall to change it, I suppose. Come on,\nyou fellows!\"\n\nThis was at least a move in the right direction; for the three began at\nonce to retrace their steps. But, unfortunately, all these explanations\nhad taken time, and before they had gone many yards, Mr. Bultitude was\nhorrified to hear the station-bell ring loudly, and immediately after a\ncloud of white steam rose above the station roof as the London train\nclanked cumbrously in, and was brought to with a prolonged screeching of\nbrakes.\n\nThe others were walking very slowly. At the present pace it would be\nalmost impossible to reach the train in time. He looked round at them\nanxiously. \"H-hadn't we better run, don't you think?\" he asked.\n\n\"Run!\" said Coker scornfully. \"What for? I'm not going to run. You can,\nif you like.\"\n\n\"Why, ah, really,\" said Paul briskly, very grateful for the permission;\n\"do you know, I think I will!\"\n\nAnd run he did, with all his might, rushing headlong through the gates,\nthreading his way between the omnibuses and under the Roman noses of the\nmild fly-horses in the enclosure, until at length he found himself\ninside the little booking-office.\n\nHe was not too late; the train was still at the platform, the engine\ngetting up steam with a dull roar. But he dared not risk detection by\ntravelling without a ticket. There was time for that, too. No one was at\nthe pigeon-hole but one old lady.\n\nBut, unhappily, the old lady considered taking a ticket as a solemn rite\nto be performed with all due caution and deliberation. She had already\ncatechised the clerk upon the number of stoppages during her proposed\njourney, and exacted earnest assurances from him that she would not be\ncalled upon to change anywhere in the course of it; and as Paul came up\nshe was laying out the purchase-money for her ticket upon the ledge and\ncounting it, which, the fare being high and the coins mostly halfpence,\nseemed likely to take some time.\n\n\"One moment, ma'am, if you please,\" cried Mr. Bultitude, panting and\ndesperate. \"I'm pressed for time.\"\n\n\"Now you've gone and put me out, little boy,\" said the old lady fussily.\n\"I shall have to begin all over again. Young man, will you take and\ncount the other end and see if it adds up right? There's a halfpenny\nwrong somewhere; I know there is.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" shouted the guard from the platform. \"Any more going on?\"\n\n\"I'm going on!\" said Paul. \"Wait for me. First single to St. Pancras,\nquick!\"\n\n\"Drat the boy!\" said the old lady angrily. \"Do you think the world's to\ngive way for you? Such impidence! Mind your manners, little boy, can't\nyou? You've made me drop a threepenny bit with your scrouging!\"\n\n\"First single, five shillings,\" said the clerk, jerking out the precious\nticket.\n\n\"Right!\" cried the guard at the same instant. \"Stand back there, will\nyou!\"\n\nPaul dashed towards the door of the booking-office which led to the\nplatform; but just as he reached it a gate slammed in his face with a\nsharp click, through the bars of it he saw, with hot eyes, the tall,\nheavy carriages which had shelter and safety in them jolt heavily past,\ntill even the red lamp on the last van was quenched in the darkness.\n\nThat miserable old woman had shattered his hopes at the very moment of\ntheir fulfilment. It was fate again!\n\nAs he stood, fiercely gripping the bars of the gate, he heard Coggs'\nhateful voice again.\n\n\"Hallo! so you haven't got the _Globe_ and the other thing after all,\nthen; they've shut you out?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Bultitude in a hollow voice; \"they've shut me out!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16. _Hard Pressed_\n\n     \"Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles,\n     How he outruns the wind, and with what care\n     He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:\n         The many musets through the which he goes\n         Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.\"\n\n\nAs soon as the gate was opened, Paul went through mechanically with the\nothers on to the platform, and waited at the bookstall while they\nchanged the paper. He knew well enough that what had seemed at the time\na stroke of supreme cunning would now only land him in fresh\ndifficulties, if indeed it did not lead to the detection of his scheme.\nBut he dared not interfere and prevent them from making the unlucky\nexchange. Something seemed to tie his tongue, and in sullen leaden\napathy he resigned himself to whatever might be in store for him.\n\nThey passed out again by the booking-office. There was the old lady\nstill at the pigeon-hole, trying to persuade the much-enduring clerk to\nrestore a lucky sixpence she had given him by mistake, and was quite\nunable to describe. Mr. Bultitude would have given much just then to go\nup and shake her into hysterics, or curse her bitterly for the mischief\nshe had done; but he refrained, either from an innate chivalry, or from\na feeling that such an outburst would be ill-judged.\n\nSo, silent and miserable, with slow step and hanging head, he set out\nwith his gaolers to render himself up once more at his house of\nbondage--a sort of involuntary Regulus, without the oath.\n\n\"Dickie, you were very anxious to run just now,\" observed Chawner,\nafter they had gone some distance on their homeward way.\n\n\"We were late for tea--late for tea,\" explained Paul hastily.\n\n\"If you think the tea worth racing like that for, I don't,\" said Coggs\nviciously; \"it's muck.\"\n\n\"You don't catch me racing, except for something worth having,\" said\nCoker.\n\nOne more flash of distinct inspiration came to Paul's aid in the very\ndepths of his gloom. It was, in fact, a hazy recollection from English\nhistory of the ruse by which Edward I., when a prince, contrived to\nescape from his captors at Hereford Castle.\n\n\"Why--why,\" he said excitedly, \"would you race if you had something\nworth racing for, hey? would you now?\"\n\n\"Try us!\" said Coker emphatically.\n\n\"What do you call 'something'?\" inquired Chawner suspiciously.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Bultitude; \"what do you say to a shilling?\"\n\n\"You haven't got a shilling,\" objected Coggs.\n\n\"Here's a shilling, see,\" said Paul, producing one. \"Now then, I'll give\nthis to any boy I see get into tea first!\"\n\n\"Bultitude thinks he can run,\" said Coker, with an amiable unbelief in\nany disinterestedness. \"He means to get in first and keep the shilling\nhimself, I know.\"\n\n\"I'll back myself to run him any day,\" put in Coggs.\n\n\"So will I,\" added Chawner.\n\n\"Well, is it agreed?\" Paul asked anxiously. \"Will you try?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Chawner. \"You must give us a start to the next\nlamp-post, though. You stay here, and when we're ready we'll say 'off'!\"\n\nThey drew a line on the path with their feet to mark Paul's starting\npoint, and went on to the next lamp. After a moment or two of anxious\nwaiting he heard Coggs shout, all in one breath, \"One-two-three-off!\"\nand the sound of scampering feet followed immediately.\n\nIt was a most exciting and hotly contested race. Paul saw them for one\nbrief moment in the lamplight. He saw Chawner scudding down the path\nlike some great camel, and Coker squaring his arms and working them as\nif they were wings. Coggs seemed to be last.\n\nHe ran a little way himself just to encourage them, but, as the sound of\ntheir feet grew fainter and fainter, he felt that his last desperate\nruse had taken effect, and with a chuckle at his own cleverness, turned\nround and ran his fastest in the opposite direction. He felt little or\nno interest in the result of the race.\n\nOnce more he entered the booking-office and, kneeling on a chair,\nconsulted the time-board that hung on the wall over the sheaf of texts\nand the missionary box.\n\nThe next train was not until 7.25. A whole hour and twenty-five minutes\nto wait! What was he to do? Where was he to pass the weary time till\nthen? If he lingered on the platform he would assuredly be recaptured.\nHis absence could not remain long undiscovered and the station would be\nthe first place they would search for him.\n\nAnd yet he dared not wander away from the neighbourhood of the station.\nIf he kept to the shops and lighted thoroughfares he might be recognised\nor traced. If, on the other hand, he went out farther into the country\n(which was utterly unknown to him), he had no watch, and it would be\nonly too easy to lose his way, or miscalculate time and distance in the\ndarkness.\n\nTo miss the next train would be absolutely fatal.\n\nHe walked out upon the platform, and on past the refreshment and waiting\nrooms, past the weighing machine, the stacked trucks and the lamp-room,\nmeeting and seen by none--even the boy at the bookstall was busy with\nbread and butter and a mug of tea in a dark corner, and never noticed\nhim.\n\nHe went on to the end of the platform where the planks sloped gently\ndown to a wilderness of sheds, coaling stages and sidings; he could just\nmake out the bulky forms of some tarpaulined cattle-vans and open\ncoal-trucks standing on the lines of metals which gleamed in the scanty\ngaslights.\n\nIt struck him that one of these vans or trucks would serve his purpose\nadmirably, if he could only get into it, and very cautiously he picked\nhis way over the clogging ballast and rails, till he came to a low\nnarrow strip of platform between two sidings.\n\nHe mounted it and went on till he came to the line of trucks and vans\ndrawn up alongside; the vans seemed all locked, but at the end he found\nan empty coal-waggon in which he thought he could manage to conceal\nhimself and escape pursuit till the longed-for 7.25 train should arrive\nto relieve him.\n\nHe stepped in and lay down in one corner of it, listening anxiously for\nany sound of search, but hearing nothing more than the dismal dirge of\nthe telegraph wires overhead; he soon grew cold and stiff, for his\nenforced attitude was far from comfortable, and there was more coal-dust\nin his chosen retreat than he could have wished. Still it was secluded\nenough; it was not likely that it would occur to anyone to look for him\nthere. Ten days ago Mr. Paul Bultitude would have found it hard to\nconceive himself lying down in a hard and grimy coal-truck to escape his\nson's schoolmaster, but since then he had gone through too much that was\nunprecedented and abnormal to see much incongruity in his situation--it\nwas all too hideously real to be a nightmare.\n\nBut even here he was not allowed to remain undisturbed; after about half\nan hour, when he was beginning to feel almost secure, there came a sharp\ntwanging of wires beneath, and two short strokes of a bell in the\nsignal-box hard by.\n\nHe heard some one from the platform, probably the station-master,\nshout, \"Look alive, there, Ing, Pickstones, some of you. There's those\nthree trucks on the A siding to go to Slopsbury by the 6.30\nluggage--she'll be in in another five minutes.\"\n\nThere were steps as if some persons were coming out of a cabin\nopposite--they came nearer and nearer: \"These three, ain't it, Tommy?\"\nsaid a gruff voice, close to Paul's ear.\n\n\"That's it, mate,\" said another, evidently Tommy's--\"get 'em along up to\nthe points there. Can't have the 6.30 standing about on this 'ere line\nall night, 'cos of the Limited. Now then, all together, shove! they've\ngot the old 'orse on at the other end.\"\n\nAnd to Paul's alarm he felt the truck in which he was begin to move\nponderously on the greasy metals, and strike the next with its buffers\nwith a jarring shock and a jangling of coupling chains.\n\nHe could not stand this; unless he revealed himself at once, or managed\nto get out of this delusive waggon, the six-whatever-it-was train would\nbe up and carry him off to Slopsbury, a hundred miles or so farther from\nhome; they would have time to warn Dick--he would be expected--ambushes\nlaid for him, and his one chance would be gone for ever!\n\nThere was a whistle far away on the down line, and that humming\nvibration which announces an approaching train: not a moment to lose--he\nwas afraid to attempt a leap from the moving waggons, and resolved to\nrisk all and show himself.\n\nWith this intention he got upon his knees, and putting his head above\nthe dirty bulwark, looked over and said softly, \"Tommy, I say, Tommy!\"\n\nA porter, who had been laboriously employed below, looked up with a\nwhite and scared face, and staggered back several feet; Mr. Bultitude in\na sudden panic ducked again.\n\n\"Bill!\" Paul heard the porter say hoarsely, \"I'll take my Bible oath\nI've never touched a drop this week, not to speak of--but I've got 'em\nagain, Bill, I've got 'em again!\"\n\n\"Got what agin?\" growled Bill. \"What's the matter now?\"\n\n\"It's the jumps, Bill,\" gasped the other, \"the 'orrors--they've got me\nand no mistake. As I'm a livin' man, as I was a shovin' of that there\ntruck, I saw a imp--a gashly imp, Bill, stick its hugly 'ed over the\nside and say, 'Tommy,' it ses, jest like that--it ses, 'Tommy, I wants\nyou!' I dursn't go near it, Bill. I'll get leave, and go 'ome and lay\nup--it glared at me so 'orrid, Bill, and grinned--ugh! I'll take the\npledge after this 'ere, I will--I'll go to chapel Sundays reg'lar!\"\n\n\"Let's see if there ain't something there first,\" said the practical\nBill. \"Easy with the 'oss up there. Now then,\" here he stepped on the\nbox of the wheel and looked in. \"Shin out of this, whatever y'are, we\ndon't contrack to carry no imps on this line--Well, if ever I--Tommy,\nold man, it's all right, y'ain't got 'em this time--'ere's yer imp!\"\n\nAnd, reaching over, he hauled out the wretched Paul by the scruff of his\nneck in a state of utter collapse, and deposited him on the ground\nbefore him.\n\n\"That ain't your private kerridge, yer know, that ain't--there wasn't no\nbed made up there for you, that I know on. You ain't arter no good, now;\nyou're a wagabone! that's about your size, I can see--what d'yer mean by\nit, eh?\"\n\n\"Shet yer 'ed, Bill, will yer?\" said Tommy, whose relief probably\nsoftened his temper, \"this here's a young gent.\"\n\n\"Young gent, or no young gent,\" replied Bill sententiously, \"he's no\ncall to go 'idin' in our waggins and givin' 'ard-workin' men a turn.\n'Old 'im tight, Tommy--here's the luggage down on us.\"\n\nTommy held him fast with a grip of iron, while the other porters coupled\nthe trucks, and the luggage train lumbered away with its load.\n\nAfter this the men slouched up and stood round their captive, staring\nat him curiously.\n\n\"Look here, my men,\" said Paul, \"I've run away from school, I want to go\non to town by the next train, and I took the liberty of hiding in the\ntruck, because the schoolmaster will be up here very soon to look for\nme--you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Bill, \"and a nice young party _you_ are.\"\n\n\"I--I don't want to be caught,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Naterally,\" assented Tommy sympathetically.\n\n\"Well, can't you hide me somewhere where he won't see me? Come, you can\ndo that?\"\n\n\"What do you say, Bill?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"What'll the Guv'nor say?\" said Bill dubiously.\n\n\"I've got a little money,\" urged Paul. \"I'll make it worth your while.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say that afore?\" said Bill; \"the Guv'nor needn't know.\"\n\n\"Here's half-a-sovereign between you,\" said Paul, holding it out.\n\n\"That's something like a imp,\" said Tommy warmly; \"if all bogeys acted\nas 'andsome as this 'ere, I don't care how often they shows theirselves.\nWe'll have a supper on this, mates, and drink young Delirium Trimminses'\njolly good 'ealth. You come along o' me, young shaver, I'll stow you\naway right enough, and let you out when yer train comes in.\"\n\nHe led Paul on to the platform again and opened a sort of cupboard or\ncloset. \"That's where we keeps the brooms and lamp-rags, and them,\" he\nsaid; \"it ain't what you may call tidy, but if I lock you in no one\nwon't trouble you.\"\n\nIt was perfectly dark and the rags smelt unpleasantly, but Mr. Bultitude\nwas very glad of this second ark of refuge, even though he did bruise\nhis legs over the broom-handles; he was gladder still by-and-by, when he\nheard a rapid heavy footfall outside, and a voice he knew only too\nwell, saying, \"I want to see the station-master. Ha, there he is. Good\nevening, station-master, you know me--Dr. Grimstone, of Crichton House.\nI want you to assist me in a very unpleasant affair--the fact is, one of\nmy pupils has had the folly and wickedness to run away.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" said the station-master.\n\n\"It's only too true, I'm sorry to say; he seemed happy and contented\nenough, too; it's a black ungrateful business. But I must catch him, you\nknow; he must be about here somewhere, I feel sure. You don't happen to\nhave noticed a boy who looked as if he belonged to me? They can't tell\nme at the booking-office.\"\n\nHow glad Paul was now he had made no inquiries of the station-master!\n\n\"No,\" said the latter, \"I can't say I have, sir, but some of my men may\nhave come across him. I'll inquire--here, Ing, I want you; this\ngentleman here has lost one of his boys, have you seen him?\"\n\n\"What sort of a young gentleman was he to look at?\" Paul heard Tommy's\nvoice ask.\n\n\"A bright intelligent-looking boy,\" said the Doctor, \"medium height,\nabout thirteen, with auburn hair.\"\n\n\"No, I ain't seen no intelligent boys with median 'eight,\" said Tommy\nslowly, \"not leastways, to speak to positive. What might he 'ave on,\nnow, besides his oburn 'air?\"\n\n\"Black cloth jacket, with a wide collar,\" was the answer; \"grey\ntrousers, and a cloth cap with a leather peak.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Tommy, \"then I see 'im.\"\n\n\"When--where?\"\n\n\"'Bout arf an 'our since.\"\n\n\"Do you know where he is now?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, to Paul's intense horror, for he was listening,\nquaking, to every word of this conversation, which was held just outside\nhis cupboard door.\n\n\"I dessay I could give a guess if I give my mind to it.\"\n\n\"Out with it, Ing, now, if you know; no tricks,\" said the\nstation-master, who had apparently just turned to go away. \"Excuse me,\nsir, but I've some matters in there to see after.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, the Doctor said rather heatedly, \"Come, you're keeping\nsomething from me, I _will_ have it out of you. If I find you have\ndeceived me, I'll write to the manager and get you sent about your\nbusiness--you'd better tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Tommy, very slowly, and reluctantly, \"that young gent o'\nyourn _was_ a gent.\"\n\n\"I tried my very best to render him so,\" said the Doctor stiffly, \"here\nis the result--how did you discover he was one, pray?\"\n\n\"'Cos he acted like a gent,\" said Tommy; \"he took and give me a\n'arf-suffering.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll give you another,\" said the Doctor, \"if you can tell me\nwhere he is.\"\n\n\"Thankee, sir, don't you be afraid--you're a gent right enough, too,\nthough you do 'appen to be a schoolmaster.\"\n\n\"Where is the unhappy boy?\" interrupted the Doctor.\n\n\"Seems as if I was a roundin' on 'im, like, don't it a'most, sir?\" said\nTommy, with too evident symptoms of yielding in his voice. Paul shook so\nin his terror that he knocked down a broom or two with a clatter which\nfroze his blood.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the Doctor, \"not at all, my good fellow;\nyou're--ahem--advancing the cause of moral order.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah,\" said Tommy, obviously open to conviction. \"Well, if I'm a\ndoin' all that, I can't go fur wrong, can I? And arter all, we mayn't\nlike schools or schoolmasters, not over above, but we can't get on\nwithout 'em, I s'pose. But, look ye here, sir--if I goes and tells you\nwhere you can get hold of this here boy, you won't go and wallop him\nnow, will ye?\"\n\n\"I can make no bargains,\" said the Doctor; \"I shall act on my own\ndiscretion.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Tommy, unaccountably relieved, \"spoke like a merciful\nChristian gen'leman; if you don't go actin' on nothing more nor your\ndiscretion, you can't hurt him much, I take it. Well then, since you've\nspoke out fair, I don't mind putting you on his track like.\"\n\nIf the door of the cupboard had not been locked, Paul would undoubtedly\nhave burst out and yielded himself up, to escape the humiliation of\nbeing sold like this by a mercenary and treacherous porter. As it was,\nhe had to wait till the inevitable words should be spoken.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" went on Tommy, very slowly, as if struggling with the\nremnants of a conscience, \"it was like this here--he comes up to me, and\nsays--your young gen'leman, I mean--says he, 'Porter, I wants to 'ide,\nI've run away.' And I says to him, says I, 'It's no use your 'anging\nabout 'ere,' I says, ''cause, if you do, your guv'nor (meanin' no\noffence to you, sir) 'll be comin' up and ketchin' of you on the 'op.'\n'Right you are, porter,' says he to me, 'what do you advise?' he says.\n'Well,' I says, 'I don't know as I'm right in givin' you no advice at\nall, havin' run away from them as has the care on you,' I says; 'but if\n_I_ was a young gen'leman as didn't want to be ketched, I should just\nwalk on to Dufferton; it ain't on'y three mile or so, and you'll 'ave\ntime for to do it before the up-train comes along there.' 'Thankee,\nporter,' he says, 'I'll do that,' and away he bolts, and for anything I\nknow, he's 'arf way there by this time.\"\n\n\"A fly!\" shouted the Doctor excitedly, when Tommy had come to the end of\nhis veracious account. \"I'll catch the young rascal now--who has a good\nhorse? Davis, I'll take you. Five shillings if you reach Dufferton\nbefore the up-train. Take the----\"\n\nThe rest was lost in the banging of the fly door and the rumble of\nwheels; the terrible man had been got safely off on a wrong scent, and\nPaul fell back amongst the lumber in his closet, faint with the suspense\nand relief.\n\nPresently he heard Tommy's chuckling whisper through the keyhole: \"Are\nyou all right in there, sir? he's safe enough now--orf on a pretty\ndance. You didn't think I was goin' to tell on ye, did ye now? I ain't\nquite sech a cur as that comes to, particular when a young gent saves me\nfrom the 'orrors, and gives me a 'arf-suffering. I'll see you through,\nyou make yourself easy about that.\"\n\nHalf an hour went slowly by for Mr. Bultitude in his darkness and\nsolitude. The platform gradually filled, as he could tell by the tread\nof feet, the voices, and the scent of cigars, and at last, welcome\nsound, he heard the station bell ringing for the up-train.\n\nIt ran in the next minute, shaking the cupboard in which Paul crouched,\ntill the brushes rattled. There was the usual blind hurry and confusion\noutside as it stopped. Paul waited impatiently inside. The time passed,\nand still no one came to let him out. He began to grow alarmed. Could\nTommy have forgotten him? Had he been sent away by some evil chance at\nthe critical moment? Two or three times his excited fancy heard the\nfatal whistle sound for departure. Would he be left behind after all?\n\nBut the next instant the door was noiselessly unlocked. \"Couldn't do it\nafore,\" said honest Tommy. \"Our guv'nor would have seen me. Now's your\ntime. Here's a empty first-class coach I've kept for ye. In with you\nnow.\"\n\nHe hoisted Paul up the high footboard to an empty compartment, and shut\nthe door, leaving him to sink down on the luxurious cushions in\nspeechless and measureless content. But Tommy had hardly done so before\nhe reappeared and looked in. \"I say,\" he suggested, \"if I was you, I'd\nget under the seat before you gets to Dufferton, otherways your\nguv'nor'll be spottin' you. I'll lock you in.\"\n\n\"I'll get under now; some one might see me here,\" said Paul; and, too\nanxious for safety to thank his preserver, he crawled under the low,\nblue-cushioned seat, which left just room enough for him to lie there in\na very cramped and uncomfortable position. Still he need not stay there\nafter the train had once started, except for five minutes or so at\nDufferton.\n\nUnfortunately he had not been long under the seat before he heard two\nloud imperious voices just outside the carriage door.\n\n\"Porter! guard! Hi, somebody! open this door, will you; it's locked.\"\n\n\"This way, sir,\" he heard Tommy's voice say outside. \"Plenty of room\nhigher up.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go higher up. I'll go here. Just open it at once, I\ntell you.\"\n\nThe door was opened reluctantly, and two middle-aged men came in.\n\"Always take the middle carriage of a train,\" said the first. \"Safest in\nany accident, y'know. Never heard of a middle carriage of a train\ngetting smashed up, to speak of.\"\n\nThe other sat heavily down just over Paul, with a comfortable grunt, and\nthe train started, Paul feeling naturally annoyed by this intrusion, as\nit compelled him to remain in seclusion for the whole of the journey.\n\"Still,\" he thought, \"it is lucky that I had time to get under here\nbefore they came in; it would have seemed odd if I had done it\nafterwards.\" And he resigned himself to listen to the conversation which\nfollowed.\n\n\"What was it we were talking about just now?\" began the first. \"Let me\nsee. Ah! I remember. Yes; it was a very painful thing--very, indeed, I\nassure you.\"\n\nThere is a certain peculiar and uncomfortable suspicion that attacks\nmost of us at times, which cannot fairly be set down wholly to\nself-consciousness or an exaggerated idea of our own importance. I mean\nthe suspicion that a partly-heard conversation must have ourselves for\nits subject. More often than not, of course, it proves utterly\nunfounded, but once in a way, like most presentiments, it finds itself\nunpleasantly fulfilled.\n\nMr. Bultitude, though he failed to recognise either of the voices, was\nsomehow persuaded that the conversation had something to do with\nhimself, and listened with eager attention.\n\n\"Yes,\" the speaker continued; \"he was never, according to what I hear, a\nman of any extraordinary capacity, but he was always spoken of as a man\nof standing in the City, doing a safe business, not a risky one, and so\non, you know. So, of course, his manner, when I called, shocked me all\nthe more.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the other. \"Was he violent or insulting, then?\"\n\n\"No, no! I can only describe his conduct as eccentric--what one might\ncall reprehensibly eccentric and extravagant. I didn't call exactly in\nthe way of business, but about a poor young fellow in my house, who is,\nI fear, rather far gone in consumption, and, knowing he was a Life\nGovernor, y'know, I thought he might give me a letter for the hospital.\nWell, when I got up to Mincing Lane----\"\n\nPaul started. It was as he had feared, then; they _were_ speaking of\nhim!\n\n\"When I got there, I sent in my card with a message that, if he was\nengaged or anything, I would take the liberty of calling at his private\nhouse, and so on. But they said he would see me. The clerk who showed me\nin said: 'You'll find him a good deal changed, if you knew him, sir.\nWe're very uneasy about him here,' which prepared me for something out\nof the common. Well, I went into a sort of inner room, and there he was,\nin his shirt-sleeves, busy over some abomination he was cooking at the\nstove, with the office-boy helping him! I never was so taken aback in my\nlife. I said something about calling another time, but Bultitude----\"\n\nPaul groaned. The blow had fallen. Well, it was better to be prepared\nand know the worst.\n\n\"Bultitude says, just like a great awkward schoolboy, y'know, 'What's\nyour name? How d'ye do? Have some hardbake, it's just done?' Fancy\nfinding a man in his position cooking toffee in the middle of the day,\nand offering it to a perfect stranger!\"\n\n\"Softening of the brain--must be,\" said the other.\n\n\"I fear so. Well, he asked what I wanted, and I told him, and he\nactually said he never did any business now, except sign his name where\nhis clerks told him. He'd worked hard all his life, he said, and he was\ntired of it. Business was, I understood him to say, 'all rot!'\"\n\n\"Then he wouldn't promise me votes or give me a letter or anything,\nwithout consulting his head clerk; he seemed to know nothing whatever\nabout it himself, and when that was over, he asked me a quantity of\nfrivolous questions which appeared to have a sort of catch in them, as\nfar as I could gather, and he was exceedingly angry when I wouldn't\nhumour him.\"\n\n\"What kind of questions?\"\n\n\"Well, really I hardly know. I believe he wanted to know whether I would\nrather be a bigger fool than I looked or look a bigger fool than I was,\nand he pressed me quite earnestly to repeat some foolishness after him,\nabout 'being a gold key,' when he said 'he was a gold lock,' I was very\nglad to get away from him, it was so distressing.\"\n\n\"They tell me he has begun to speculate, too, lately,\" said the other.\n\"You see his name about in some very queer things. It's a pitiful affair\naltogether.\"\n\nPaul writhed under his seat with shame. How could he, even if he\nsucceeded in ousting Dick and getting back his old self, how could he\never hold up his head again after this?\n\nWhy, Dick must be mad. Even a schoolboy would have had more caution when\nso much depended on it. But none would suspect the real cause of the\nchange. These horrible tales were no doubt being circulated everywhere!\n\nThe conversation fell back into a less personal channel again after\nthis; they talked of \"risks,\" of some one who had only been \"writing\" a\nyear and was doing seven thousand a week, of losses they had been \"on,\"\nand of the uselessness of \"writing five hundred on everything,\" and\nwhile at this point the train slackened and stopped--they had reached\nDufferton.\n\nThere was an opening of doors all along the train, and sounds of some\ninquiry and answer at each. The voices became audible at length, and, as\nhe had expected, Paul found that the Doctor, not having discovered him\non the platform, was making a systematic search of the train, evidently\nbelieving that he had managed to slip in somewhere unobserved.\n\nIt was a horrible moment when the door of his compartment was flung open\nand a stream of ice-cold air rushed under the blue cloth which,\nfortunately for Paul, hung down almost to the floor.\n\nSome one held a lantern up outside, and by its rays Paul saw from behind\nthe hanging the upper half of Dr. Grimstone appear, very pale and\npolite, at the doorway. He remained there for some moments without\nspeaking, carefully examining every corner of the compartment.\n\nThe two men on the seats drew their wraps about them and shivered, until\nat length one said rather testily--\"Get in, sir; kindly get in if you're\ncoming on, please. This draught is most unpleasant!\"\n\n\"I do not propose to travel by this train, sir,\" said the Doctor; \"but,\nas a person entrusted with the care of youth, permit me to inquire\nwhether you have seen (or, it may be assisted to conceal) a small boy of\nintelligent appearance----\"\n\n\"Why should we conceal small boys of intelligent appearance about us,\npray?\" demanded the man who had described his visit to Mincing Lane.\n\"And may we ask you to shut that door, and make any communications you\nwish to make through the window, or else come in and sit down?\"\n\n\"That's not an answer to my question, sir,\" retorted the Doctor. \"I\nnotice you carefully decline to say whether you have seen a boy. I\nconsider your manner suspicious, sir; and I shall insist on searching\nthis carriage through and through till I find that boy!\"\n\nMr. Bultitude rolled himself up close against the partition at these\nawful words.\n\n\"Guard, guard!\" shouted the first gentleman. \"Come here. Here's a\nviolent person who will search this carriage for something he has lost.\nI won't be inconvenienced in this way without any reason whatever! He\nsays we're hiding a boy in here!\"\n\n\"Guard!\" said the Doctor, quite as angrily, \"I insist upon looking under\nthese seats before you start the train. I've looked through every other\ncarriage and he must be in here. Gentlemen, let me pass, I'll get him if\nI have to travel in this compartment to town with you!\"\n\n\"For peace and quietness sake, gentlemen,\" said the guard, \"let him look\nround, just to ease his mind. Lend me your stick a minute, sir, please.\nI'll turn him out if he's anywhere about this here compartment!\"\n\nAnd with this he pulled Dr. Grimstone down from the footboard and\nmounted it himself; after which he began to rummage about under the\nseats with the Doctor's heavy stick.\n\nEvery lunge found out some tender part in Mr. Bultitude's person and\ncaused him exquisite torture; but he clenched his teeth hard to prevent\na sound, while he thought each fresh dig must betray his whereabouts.\n\n\"There,\" said the guard at last; \"there really ain't no one there, sir,\nyou see. I've felt everywhere and---- Hello, I certainly did feel\nsomething just then, gentlemen!\" he added, in an undertone, after a\nlunge which took all the breath out of Paul's body. All was lost now!\n\n\"You touch that again with that confounded stick if you dare!\" said one\nof the passengers. \"That's a parcel of mine. I won't have you poking\nholes through it in that way. Don't tell that lunatic behind you, he'll\nbe wanting it opened to see if his boy's inside! Now perhaps you'll let\nus alone!\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the guard at last to the Doctor, as he withdrew, \"he\nain't in there. There's nothing under any of the seats. Your boy'll be\ncomin' on by the next train, most likely--the 8.40. We're all behind.\nRight!\"\n\n\"Good night, sir,\" said the first passenger as he leant out of the\nwindow, to the baffled schoolmaster on the platform. \"You've put us to\nall this inconvenience for nothing, and in the most offensive way too. I\nhope you won't find your boy till you're in a better temper, for his\nsake.\"\n\n\"If I had you out on this platform, sir,\" shouted the angry Doctor, \"I'd\nhorsewhip you for that insult. I believe the boy's there and you know\nit. I----\"\n\nBut the train swept off and, to Paul's joy and thankfulness, soon left\nthe Doctor, gesticulating and threatening, miles behind it.\n\n\"What a violent fellow for a schoolmaster, eh?\" said one of Paul's\ncompanions, when they were fairly off again. \"I wasn't going to have him\nturning the cushions inside out here; we shouldn't have settled down\nagain before we got in!\"\n\n\"No; and if the guard hasn't, as it is, injured that Indian shawl in my\nparcel, I shall be---- Why, bless my soul, that parcel's not under the\nseat after all! It's up in the rack. I remember putting it there now.\"\n\n\"The guard must have fancied he felt something; and yet---- Look here,\nGoldicutt; just feel under here with your feet. It certainly does seem\nas if something soft was--eh?\"\n\nMr. Goldicutt accordingly explored Paul's ribs with his boot for some\nmoments, which was very painful.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" he said at last, \"it really does seem very like it. It's\nnot hard enough for a bag or a hat-box. It yields distinctly when you\nkick it. Can you fetch it out with your umbrella, do you think? Shall we\ntell the guard at the next----? Lord, it's coming out of its own accord.\nIt's a dog! No, my stars--it's the boy, after all!\"\n\nFor Paul, alarmed at the suggestion about the guard, once more felt\ninclined to risk the worst and reveal himself. Begrimed with coal,\nsmeared with whitewash, and covered with dust and flue, he crawled\nslowly out and gazed imploringly up at his fellow-passengers.\n\nAfter the first shock of surprise they lay back in their seats and\nlaughed till they cried.\n\n\"Why, you young rascal!\" they said, when they recovered breath, \"you\ndon't mean to say you've been under there the whole time?\"\n\n\"I have indeed,\" said Paul. \"I--I didn't like to come out before.\"\n\n\"And are you the boy all this fuss was about? Yes? And we kept the\nschoolmaster off without knowing it! Why, this is splendid, capital!\nYou're something like a boy, you little dog, you! This is the best joke\nI've heard for many a day!\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Paul, \"I haven't inconvenienced you. I could not help it,\nreally.\"\n\n\"Inconvenienced us? Gad, your schoolmaster came very near\ninconveniencing us and you too. But there, he won't trouble any of us\nnow. To think of our swearing by all our gods there was no boy in here,\nand vowing he shouldn't come in, while you were lying down there under\nthe seat all the time! Why, it's lovely! The boy's got pluck and manners\ntoo. Shake hands, young gentleman, you owe us no apologies. I haven't\nhad such a laugh for many a day!\"\n\n\"Then you--you won't give me up?\" faltered poor Paul.\n\n\"Well,\" said the one who was called Goldicutt, and who was a jovial old\ngentleman with a pink face and white whiskers, \"we're not exactly going\nto take the trouble of getting out at the next station, and bringing\nyou back to Dufferton, just to oblige that hot-tempered master of yours,\nyou know; he hasn't been so particularly civil as to deserve that.\"\n\n\"But if he were to telegraph and get some one to stop me at St.\nPancras?\" said Paul nervously.\n\n\"Ah, he might do that, to be sure--sharp boy this--well, as we've gone\nso far, I suppose we must go through with the business now and smuggle\nthe young scamp past the detectives, eh, Travers?\"\n\nThe younger man addressed assented readily enough, for the Doctor had\nbeen so unfortunate as to prejudice them both from the first by his\nunjustifiable suspicions, and it is to be feared they had no scruples in\nhelping to outwit him.\n\nThen they noticed the pitiable state Mr. Bultitude was in, and he had to\ngive them a fair account of his escape and subsequent adventures, at\nwhich even their sympathy could not restrain delighted shouts of\nlaughter--though Paul himself saw little enough in it all to laugh at;\nthey asked his name, which he thought more prudent, for various reasons,\nto give as \"Jones,\" and other details, which I am afraid he invented as\nhe went on, and altogether they reached Kentish Town in a state of high\nsatisfaction with themselves and their protÃ©gÃ©.\n\nAt Kentish Town there was one more danger to be encountered, for with\nthe ticket collector there appeared one of the station inspectors. \"Beg\npardon, gentlemen,\" said the latter, peering curiously in, \"but does\nthat young gent in the corner happen to belong to either of you?\"\n\nThe white-whiskered gentleman seemed a little flustered at this\ndownright inquiry, but the other was more equal to the occasion. \"Do you\nhear that, Johnny, my boy,\" he said, to Paul (whom they had managed\nduring the journey to brush and scrape into something approaching\nrespectability), \"they want to know if you belong to me. I suppose\nyou'll allow a son to belong to his father to a certain extent, eh?\" he\nasked the inspector.\n\nThe man apologised for what he conceived to be a mistake. \"We've orders\nto look out for a young gent about the size of yours, sir,\" he\nexplained; \"no offence meant, I'm sure,\" and he went away satisfied.\n\nA very few minutes more and the train rolled in to the terminus, under\nthe same wide arch beneath which Paul had stood, helpless and\nbewildered, a week ago.\n\n\"Now my advice to you, young man,\" said Mr. Goldicutt, as he put Paul\ninto a cab, and pressed half-a-sovereign into his unwilling hand, \"is to\ngo straight home to Papa and tell him all about it. I daresay he won't\nbe very hard on you--here's my card, refer him to me if you like.\nGood-night, my boy, good-night, and good luck to you. Gad, the best joke\nI've had for years!\"\n\nAnd the cab rolled away, leaving them standing chuckling on the\nplatform, and, as Paul found himself plunging once more into the welcome\nroar and rattle of London streets, he forgot the difficulties and\ndangers that might yet lie before him in the thought that at last he was\nbeyond the frontier, and, for the first time since he had slipped\nthrough the playground gate, he breathed freely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17. _A Perfidious Ally_\n\n     \"But homeward--home--what home? had he a home?\n     His home--he walk'd;\n     Then down the long street having slowly stolen,\n     His heart foreshadowing all calamity,\n     His eyes upon the stones, he reached his home.\"\n\n\nPaul had been careful, whilst in the hearing of his friends, to give the\ncabman a fictitious address, but as soon as he reached the Euston Road,\nhe stopped the man and ordered him to put him down at the church near\nthe south end of Westbourne Terrace, for he dared not drive up openly to\nhis own door.\n\nAt last he found himself standing safely on the pavement, looking down\nthe long line of yellow lamps of his own terrace, only a few hundred\nyards from home.\n\nBut though his purpose was now within easy reach, his spirits were far\nfrom high; his anxiety had returned with tenfold power; he felt no\neagerness or exultation; on the contrary, the task he had set himself\nhad never before seemed so hopeless, so insurmountable.\n\nHe stood for some time by the railing of the church, which was lighted\nup for evening service, listening blankly to the solemn drone of the\norgan within, unable to summon up resolution to move from the spot and\npresent himself to his unsuspecting family.\n\nIt was a cold night, with a howling wind, and high in the blue black sky\nfleecy clouds were coursing swiftly along; he obliged himself to set out\nat last, and walked down the flags towards his house, shivering as much\nfrom nervousness as cold.\n\nThere was a dance somewhere in the terrace that evening, a large one; as\nfar as he could see there were close ranks of carriages with blazing\nlamps, and he even fancied he could hear the shouts of the link-boys and\nthe whistles summoning cabs.\n\nAs he came nearer, he had a hideous suspicion, which soon became a\ncertainty, that the entertainment was at his own house; worse still, it\nwas of a kind and on a scale calculated to shock and horrify any prudent\nhouseholder and father of a family.\n\nThe balcony above the portico was positively hung with gaudy Chinese\nlanterns, and there were even some strange sticks and shapes up in one\ncorner that looked suspiciously like fireworks. Fireworks in Westbourne\nTerrace! What would the neighbours think or do?\n\nBetween the wall which separates the main road from the terrace and the\nstreet front there were no less than four piano-organs, playing, it is\nto be feared, by express invitation; and there was the usual crowd of\nidlers and loungers standing about by the awning stretched over the\nportico, listening to the music and loud laughter which came from the\nbrilliantly lighted upper rooms.\n\nPaul remembered then, too late, that Barbara in that memorable letter\nof hers had mentioned a grand children's party as being in\ncontemplation. Dick had held his tongue about it that morning; and he\nhimself had not thought it was to be so soon.\n\nFor an instant he felt almost inclined to turn away and give the whole\nthing up in sick despair--even to return to Market Rodwell and brave the\nDoctor's anger; for how could he hope to explain matters to his family\nand servants, or get the GarudÃ¢ Stone safely into his hands again before\nall these guests, in the whirl and tumult of an evening party?\n\nAnd yet he dared not, after all, go back to Crichton House--that was too\nterrible an alternative, and he obviously could not roam the world to\nany extent, a runaway schoolboy to all appearance, and with less than a\nsovereign in his pocket!\n\nAfter a short struggle, he felt he must make his way in, watch and wait,\nand leave the rest to chance. It was his evil fate, after all, that had\nled him on to make his escape on this night of all others, and had\nallowed him to come through so much, only to be met with these\nunforeseen complications just when he might have imagined the worst was\nover.\n\nHe forced his way through the staring crowd, and went down the steps\ninto the area; for he naturally shrank from braving the front door, with\nits crowd of footmen and hired waiters.\n\nHe found the door in the basement open, which was fortunate, and slipped\nquietly through the pantry, intending to reach the hall by the kitchen\nstairs. But here another check met him. The glass door which led to the\nstairs happened to be shut, and he heard voices in the kitchen, which\nconvinced him that if he wished to escape notice he must wait quietly in\nthe darkness until the door was opened for him, whenever that might be.\n\nThe door from the pantry to the kitchen was partly open, however, and\nMr. Bultitude could not avoid hearing everything that passed there,\nalthough every fresh word added to his uneasiness, until at last he\nwould have given worlds to escape from his involuntary position of\neavesdropper.\n\nThere were only two persons just then in the kitchen: his cook, who,\nstill in her working dress, was refreshing herself after her labours\nover the supper with a journal of some sort, and the housemaid, who, in\nneat gala costume, was engaged in fastening a pin more securely in her\nwhite cap.\n\n\"They haven't give me a answer yet, Eliza,\" said the cook, looking up\nfrom her paper.\n\n\"Lor, cook!\" said Eliza, \"you couldn't hardly expect it, seeing you only\nwrote on Friday.\"\n\n\"No more I did, Eliza. You see it on'y began to come into my mind sudden\nlike this last week. I'm sure I no more dreamt----. But they've answered\na lady who's bin in much the same situation as me aperiently. You just\n'ark to this a minute.\" And she proceeded to read from her paper:\n\"'_Lady Bird._--You ask us (1) what are the signs by which you may\nrecognise the first dawnings of your lover's affection. On so delicate a\nmatter we are naturally averse from advising you; your own heart must be\nyour best guide. But perhaps we may mention a few of the most usual and\ninfallible symptoms'--What sort of a thing is a symptim, Eliza?\"\n\n\"A symptim, cook,\" explained Eliza, \"is somethink wrong with the inside.\nHer at my last place in Cadogan Square had them uncommon bad. She was\nwhat they call Ã¦sthetical, pore young thing. Them infallible ones are\nalways the worst.\"\n\n\"It don't seem to make sense though, Eliza,\" objected cook doubtfully.\n\"Hear how it goes on: 'Infallible symptoms. If you have truly inspired\nhim with a genuine and lasting passion' (don't he write beautiful?)\n'passion, he will continually haunt those places in which you are most\nlikely to be found' (I couldn't tell you the times master's bin down in\nmy kitching this last week); 'he will appear awkward and constrained in\nyour presence' (anything more awkward than master _I_ never set eyes on.\nHe's knocked down one of the best porcelain vegetables this very\nafternoon!); 'he will beg for any little favours, some trifle, it may\nbe, made by your own hand' (master's always a-asking if I've got any of\nthose doughnuts to give away); 'and, if granted, he will treasure them\nin secret with pride and rapture' (I don't think master kep' any of them\ndoughnuts though, Eliza. I saw him swaller five; but you couldn't\ntreasure a doughnut, not to mention---- I'll make him a pincushion when\nI've time, and see what he does with it). 'If you detect all these\nindications of liking in the person you suspect of paying his addresses\nto you, you may safely reckon upon bringing him to your feet in a very\nshort space of time. (2) Yes, fuller's earth will make them exquisitely\nwhite.'\"\n\n\"There, Eliza!\" said cook, with some pride, when she had finished; \"if\nit had been meant for me it couldn't have been clearer. Ain't it written\nnice? And on'y to think of my bringing master to my feet! It seems\nalmost too much for a cook to expect!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say so, cook; I wouldn't. Have some proper pride. Don't let\nhim think he's only to ask and have! Why, in the _London Journal_ last\nweek there was a dook as married a governess; and I should 'ope as a\ncook ranked above a governess. Nor yet master ain't a dook; he's only in\nthe City! But are you sure he's not only a-trifling with your\naffections, cook? He's bin very affable and pleasant with all of us\nlately.\"\n\n\"It ain't for me to speak too positive, Eliza,\" said cook almost\nbashfully, \"nor to lay bare the feelings of a bosom, beyond what's right\nand proper. You're young yet, Eliza, and don't understand these\nthings--leastways, it's to be hoped not\" (Eliza having apparently tossed\nher head); \"but do you remember that afternoon last week as master\nstayed at home a-playin' games with the children? I was a-goin' upstairs\nto fetch my thimble, and there, on the bedroom landin', was master all\nalone, with one of Master Dick's toy-guns in his 'and, and a old slouch\n'at on his head.\n\n\"'Have you got a pass, cook?' he says, and my 'art came right up into my\nmouth, he looked that severe and lofty at me. I thought he was put out\nabout something.\"\n\n\"I said I didn't know as it was required, but I could get one, I says,\nnot knowing what he was alludin' to all the same.\"\n\n\"But he says, quite soft and tender-like,\" (here Paul shivered with\nshame), \"'No, you needn't do that, cook, there ain't any occasion for\nit; only,' he says, 'if you haven't got no pass, you'll have to give me\na kiss, you know, cook!' I thought I should have sunk through the\nstairs, I was that overcome. I saw through his rouge with half an eye.\"\n\n\"Why, he said the same to me,\" said Eliza, \"only I had a pass, as luck\nhad it, which Miss Barbara give me. I'd ha' boxed his ears if he'd tried\nit, too, master or no master!\"\n\n\"You talk light, Eliza,\" said the cook sentimentally, \"but you weren't\nthere to see. It wasn't only the words, it was the way he said it, and\nthe 'ug he gave me at the time. It was as good as a proposial. And, I\ntell you, whatever you may say--and mark my words--I 'ave 'opes!\"\n\n\"Then, if I was you, cook,\" said Eliza, \"I'd try if I could get him to\nspeak out plain in writing; then, whatever came of it, there'd be as\ngood as five hundred pounds in your pockets.\"\n\n\"Love-letters!\" cried the cook, \"why, Lord love you, Eliza---- Why,\nWilliam, how you made me jump! I thought you was up seein' to the\nsupper-table.\"\n\n\"The pastrycook's man is looking after all that, Jane,\" said Boaler's\nvoice. \"I've been up outside the droring-room all this time, lookin' at\nthe games goin' on in there. It's as good as a play to see the way as\nmaster is a unbendin' of himself, and such a out and out stiff-un as he\nused to be, too! But it ain't what I like to see in a respectable house.\nI'm glad I give warning. It doesn't do for a man in my position to\ncompromise his character by such goings on. I never see anything like it\nin any families I lived with before. Just come up and see for yourself.\nYou needn't mind about cleanin' of yourself--they won't see you.\"\n\nSo the cook allowed herself to be persuaded by Boaler, and the two went\nup to the hall, and, to Mr. Bultitude's intense relief, forgot to close\nthe glazed door which cut him off from the staircase.\n\nAs he followed them upstairs at a cautious interval, and thought over\nwhat he had just so unwillingly overheard, he felt as one who had just\nbeen subjected to a moral showerbath. \"That dreadful woman!\" he groaned.\n\"Who would have dreamed that she would get such horrible ideas into her\nhead? I shall never be able to look either of those women in the face\nagain: they will both have to go--and she made such excellent soup, too.\nI do hope that miserable Dick has not been fool enough to write to\nher--but no, that's too absurd.\"\n\nBut more than ever he began to wish that he had stayed in the\nplayground.\n\nWhen he reached the hall he stood there for some moments in anxious\ndeliberation over his best course of proceeding. His main idea was to\nlie in wait somewhere for Dick, and try the result of an appeal to his\nbetter feelings to acknowledge his outcast parent and abdicate\ngracefully.\n\nIf that failed, and there was every reason to expect that it would fail,\nhe must threaten to denounce him before the whole party. It would cause\na considerable scandal no doubt, and be extremely repugnant to his own\nfeelings, but still he must do it, or frighten Dick by threatening to do\nit, and at all hazards he must contrive during the interview to snatch\nor purloin the magic stone; without that he was practically helpless.\n\nHe looked round him: the study was piled up with small boys' hats and\ncoats, and in one corner was a kind of refined bar, where till lately a\ntrim housemaid had been dispensing coffee and weak lemonade; she might\nreturn at any moment, he would not be safe there.\n\nNor would the dining-room be more secluded, for in it there was an\nelaborate supper being laid out by the waiters which, as far as he could\nsee through the crack in the door, consisted chiefly of lobsters,\ntrifle, and pink champagne. He felt a grim joy at the sight, more than\nhe would suffer for this night's festivities.\n\nAs he stole about, with a dismal sense of the unfitness of his sneaking\nabout his own house in this guilty fashion, he became gradually aware of\nthe scent of a fine cigar, one of his own special CabaÃ±as. He wondered\nwho had the impudence to trespass on his cigar-chest; it could hardly be\none of the children.\n\nHe traced the scent to a billiard room which he had built out at the\nside of the house, which was a corner one, and going down to the door\nopened it sharply and walked in.\n\nComfortably imbedded in the depths of a long well-padded lounging chair,\nwith a spirit case and two or three bottles of soda water at his elbow,\nsat a man who was lazily glancing through the _Field_ with his feet\nresting on the mantelpiece, one on each side of the blazing fire. He was\na man of about the middle size, with a face rather bronzed and reddened\nby climate, a nose slightly aquiline and higher in colour, quick black\neyes with an uneasy glance in them, bushy black whiskers, more like the\nantiquated \"Dundreary\" type than modern fashion permits, and a wide\nflexible mouth.\n\nPaul knew him at once, though he had not seen him for some years; it was\nParadine, his disreputable brother-in-law--the \"Uncle Marmaduke\" who, by\nimporting the mysterious GarudÃ¢ Stone, had brought all these woes upon\nhim; he noticed at once that his appearance was unusually prosperous,\nand that the braided smoking coat he wore over his evening clothes was\nnew and handsome. \"No wonder,\" he thought bitterly, \"the fellow has been\nliving on me for a week!\" He stood by the cue-rack looking at him for\nsome time, and then he said with a cold ironic dignity that (if he had\nknown it) came oddly from his boyish lips: \"I hope you are making\nyourself quite comfortable?\"\n\nMarmaduke put down his cigar and stared: \"Uncommonly attentive and\npolite of you to inquire,\" he said at last, with a dubious smile, which\nshowed a row of very white teeth, \"whoever you are. If it will relieve\nyour mind at all to know, young man, I'm happy to say I am tolerably\ncomfortable, thanks.\"\n\n\"I--I concluded as much,\" said Paul, nearly choked with rage.\n\n\"You've been very nicely brought up,\" said Uncle Marmaduke, \"I can see\nthat at a glance. So you've come in here, like me, eh? because the\nchildren bore you, and you want a quiet gossip over the world in\ngeneral? Sit down then, take a cigar, if you don't think it will make\nyou very unwell. I shouldn't recommend it myself, you know, before\nsupper--but you're a man of the world and know what's good for you. Come\nalong, enjoy yourself till you find yourself getting queer--then drop\nit.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude had always detested the man--there was an underbred\nswagger and familiarity in his manner that made him indescribably\noffensive; just now he seemed doubly detestable, and yet Paul by a\nstrong effort succeeded in controlling his temper.\n\nHe could not afford to make enemies just then, and objectionable as the\nman was, his astuteness made him a valuable ally; he determined, without\nconsidering the risk of making such a confident, to tell him all and ask\nhis advice and help.\n\n\"Don't you know me, Paradine?\"\n\n\"I don't think I have the privilege--you're one of Miss Barbara's\nnumerous young friends, I suppose? and yet, now I look at you, you\ndon't seem to be exactly got up for an evening party; there's something\nin your voice, too, I ought to know.\"\n\n\"You ought,\" said Paul, with a gulp. \"My name is Paul Bultitude!\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" cried Marmaduke. \"By Jove, then, you're my young nephew,\ndon't you know; I'm your long-lost uncle, my boy, I am indeed (I'll\nexcuse you from coming to my arms, however; I never was good at family\nembraces). But, I say, you little rascal, you've never been asked to\nthese festivities, you ought to be miles away, fast asleep in your bed\nat school. What in the name of wonder are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I've--left school,\" said Paul.\n\n\"So I perceive. Sulky because they left you out of all this, eh? Thought\nyou'd turn up in the middle of the banquet, like the spectre\nbridegroom--'the worms they crawled in, and the worms they crawled out,'\neh? Well, I like your pluck, but, ahem--I'm afraid you'll find they've\nrather an unpleasant way of laying your kind of apparitions.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that,\" said Paul hurriedly; \"I have something I must\ntell you--I've no time to lose. I'm a desperate man!\"\n\n\"You are,\" Paradine assented with a loud laugh, \"oh, you are indeed! 'a\ndesperate man.' Capital! a stern chase, eh? the schoolmaster close\nbehind with the birch! It's quite exciting, you know, but, seriously,\nI'm very much afraid you'll catch it!\"\n\n\"If,\" began Mr. Bultitude in great embarrassment, \"if I was to tell you\nthat I was not myself at all--but somebody else, a--in fact, an entirely\ndifferent person from what I seem to you to be--I suppose you would\nlaugh?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said his brother-in-law politely, \"I don't think I\nquite catch the idea.\"\n\n\"When I assure you now, solemnly, as I stand here before you, that I am\nnot the miserable boy whose form I am condemned to--to wear, you'll say\nit is incredible?\"\n\n\"Not at all--by no means, I quite believe you. Only (really it's a mere\ndetail), but I should rather like to know, if you're not that particular\nboy, what other boy you may happen to be. You'll forgive my curiosity.\"\n\n\"I'm not a boy at all--I'm your own unhappy brother-in-law, Paul! You\ndon't believe me, I see.\"\n\n\"Oh, pardon me, it's perfectly clear! you're not your own son, but your\nown father--it's a little confusing at first, but no doubt common\nenough. I'm glad you mentioned it, though.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Paul bitterly, \"make light of it--you fancy you are being\nvery clever, but you will find out the truth in time!\"\n\n\"Not without external assistance, I'm afraid,\" said Paradine calmly. \"A\nmore awful little liar for your age I never saw!\"\n\n\"I'm tired of this,\" said Paul. \"Only listen to reason and common\nsense!\"\n\n\"Only give me a chance.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" protested Paul earnestly, \"it's the sober awful truth--I'm\nnot a boy, it's years since I was a boy--I'm a middle-aged man, thrust\ninto this, this humiliating form.\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" murmured the other; \"it's an excellent fit--very\nbecoming, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Do you want to drive me mad with your clumsy jeers?\" cried Paul. \"Look\nat me. Do I speak, do I behave, like an ordinary schoolboy?\"\n\n\"I really hope not--for the sake of the rising generation,\" said Uncle\nMarmaduke, chuckling at his own powers of repartee.\n\n\"You are very jaunty to-day--you look as if you were well off,\" said\nPaul slowly. \"I remember a time when a certain bill was presented to me,\ndrawn by you, and appearing to be accepted (long before I ever saw it)\nby me. I consented to meet it for my poor Maria's sake, and because to\ndisown my signature would have ruined you for life. Do you remember how\nyou went down on your knees in my private room and swore you would\nreform and be a credit to your family yet? You weren't quite so well\noff, or so jaunty then, unless I am very much mistaken.\"\n\nThese words had an extraordinary effect upon Uncle Marmaduke; he turned\nashy white, and his quick eyes shifted restlessly as he half rose from\nhis chair and threw away his unfinished cigar.\n\n\"You young hound!\" he said, breathing hard and speaking under his\nbreath. \"How did you get hold of that--that lying story? Your father\nmust have let it out! Why do you bring up bygones like this? You--you're\na confounded, disagreeable little prig! Who told you to play an\nill-natured trick of this sort on an uncle, who may have been wild and\nreckless in his youth--was in fact--but who never, never misused his\nrelation towards you as--as an uncle?\"\n\n\"How did I get hold of the story?\" said Paul, observing the impression\nhe had made. \"Do you think if I were really a boy of thirteen I should\nknow as much about you as I do? Do you want to know more? Ask, if you\ndare! Shall I tell you how it was you left your army coach without going\nup for examination? Will you have the story of your career in my old\nfriend Parkinson's counting-house, or the real reason of your trip to\nNew York, or what it was that made your father add that codicil, cutting\nyou off with a set of engravings of the 'Rake's Progress,' and a guinea\nto pay for framing them? I can tell you all about it, if you care to\nhear.\"\n\n\"No!\" shrieked Paradine, \"I won't listen. When you grow up, ask your\nfather to buy you a cheap Society journal. You're cut out for an editor\nof one. It doesn't interest me.\"\n\n\"Do you believe my story or not?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"I don't know. Who could believe it?\" said the other sullenly. \"How can\nyou possibly account for it?\"\n\n\"Do you remember giving Maria a little sandal-wood box with a small\nstone in it?\" said Paul.\n\n\"I have some recollection of giving her something of that kind. A\ncuriosity, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"I wish I had never seen it. That infernal stone, Paradine, has done all\nthis to me. Did no one tell you it was supposed to have any magic\npower?\"\n\n\"Why, now I think of it, that old black rascal, Bindabun Doss, did try\nto humbug me with some such story; said it was believed to be a\ntalisman, but the secret was lost. I thought it was just his stingy way\nof trying to make the rubbish out as something priceless, as it ought to\nhave been, considering all I did for the old ruffian.\"\n\n\"You told Maria it was a talisman. Bindabun what's-his-name was right.\nIt is a talisman of the deadliest sort. I'll soon convince you, if you\nwill only hear me out.\"\n\nAnd then, in white-hot wrath and indignation, Mr. Bultitude began to\ntell the story I have already attempted to sketch here, dwelling\nbitterly on Dick's heartless selfishness and cruelty, and piteously on\nhis own incredible sufferings, while Uncle Marmaduke, lolling back in\nhis armchair with an attempt (which was soon abandoned) to retain a\nsmile of amused scepticism on his face, heard him out in complete\nsilence and with all due gravity.\n\nIndeed, Paul's manner left him no room for further unbelief. His tale,\nwild and improbable as it was, was too consistent and elaborate for any\nschoolboy to have invented, and, besides, the imposture would have been\nso entirely purposeless.\n\nWhen his brother-in-law had come to the end of his sad history, Paradine\nwas silent for some time. It was some relief to know that the darkest\nsecrets of his life had not been ferreted out by a phenomenally sharp\nnephew; but the change in the situation was not without its\ndrawbacks--it remained to be seen how it might affect himself. He\nalready saw his reign in Westbourne Terrace threatened with a speedy\ndetermination unless he played his cards well.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, with a swift, keen glance at Paul, who sat\nanxiously waiting for his next words; \"suppose I were to say that I\nthink there may be something in this story of yours, what then? What is\nit you want me to do for you?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Paul, \"with all you owe to me, now you know the horrible\ninjustice I have had to bear, you surely don't mean to say that you\nwon't help me to right myself?\"\n\n\"And if I did help you, what then?\"\n\n\"Why, I should be able to recover all I have lost, of course,\" said Mr.\nBultitude. He thought his brother-in-law had grown very dull.\n\n\"Ah, but I mean, what's to become of _me_?\"\n\n\"You?\" repeated Paul (he had not thought of that). \"Well, hum, from what\nI know and what you know that I know about your past life, you can't\nexpect me to encourage you to remain here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Uncle Marmaduke. \"Of course not; very right and proper.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Paul, willing to make all reasonable concessions, \"anything\nI can do to advance your prospects--such as paying your passage out to\nNew York, you know, and so on--I should be very ready to do.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said the other.\n\n\"And even, if necessary, provide you with a small fund to start afresh\nupon--honestly,\" said Paul; \"you will not find me difficult to deal\nwith.\"\n\n\"It's a dazzling proposition,\" remarked Paradine drily. \"You have such\nan alluring way of putting things. But the fact, is, you'll hardly\nbelieve it, but I'm remarkably well off here. I am indeed. Your son, you\nknow, though not you (except as a mere matter of form), really makes, as\nthey say of the marmalade in the advertisements, an admirable\nsubstitute. I doubt, I do assure you, whether you yourself would have\nreceived me with quite the same warmth and hospitality I have met with\nfrom him.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Paul; \"very much.\"\n\n\"Just so; for, without your admirable business capacity and\nextraordinary firmness of character, you know, he has, if you'll excuse\nmy saying so, a more open guileless nature, a more entire and touching\nfaith in his fellow-man and brother-in-law, than were ever yours.\"\n\n\"To say that to me,\" said Paul hotly, \"is nothing less than sheer\nimpudence.\"\n\n\"My dear Paul (it does seem deuced odd to be talking to a little shrimp\nlike you as a grown-up brother-in-law. I shall get used to it presently,\nI daresay). I flatter myself I am a man of the world. We're dealing with\none another now, as the lawyers have it, at arm's length. Just put\nyourself in my place (you're so remarkably good at putting yourself in\nother people's places, you know). Look at the thing from my point of\nview. Accidentally dropping in at your offices to negotiate (if I could)\na small temporary loan from anyone I chanced to meet on the premises, I\nfind myself, to my surprise, welcomed with effusion into what I then\nimagined to be your arms. More than that, I was invited here for an\nindefinite time, all my little eccentricities unmentioned, overlooked. I\nwas deeply touched (it struck me, I confess, at one time that you must\nbe touched too), but I made the best use of my opportunities. I made hay\nwhile the sun shone.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to make me lose my temper?\" interrupted Paul. \"It will not\ntake much more.\"\n\n\"I have no objection. I find men as a rule easier to deal with when they\nhave once lost their temper, their heads so often go too. But to return:\na man with nerve and his fair share of brains, like myself, only wants a\ncapitalist (he need not be a millionaire) at his back to conquer the\nworld. It's not by any means my first campaign, and I've had my\nreverses, but I see victory in my grasp, sir, in my grasp at last!\"\n\nPaul groaned.\n\n\"Now you--it's not your fault, I know, a mere defect of constitution;\nbut you, as a speculator, were, if I may venture to put it so, not worth\nyour salt; no boldness, no dash, all caution. But your promising son is\na regular whale on speculation, and I may tell you that we stand in\ntogether in some little ventures that would very probably make your hair\nstand on end--_you_ wouldn't have touched them. And yet there's money in\nevery one of them.\"\n\n\"_My_ money!\" said Paul savagely; \"and it won't come out again.\"\n\n\"You don't know much about these things, you see,\" said Marmaduke; \"I\ntell you I have my eye on some fine openings for capital.\"\n\n\"Your pockets always were very fine openings for capital,\" retorted\nPaul.\n\n\"Ha, ha, deuced sharp that! But, to come to the point, you were always a\nsensible practical kind of a fellow, and you must see, that, for me to\nback you up and upset this young rascal who has stepped into your\nslippers, might be morally meritorious enough, but, treating it from a\npurely pecuniary point of view, it's not business.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Mr. Bultitude heavily; \"then you side against me?\"\n\n\"Did I ever say I would side against you? Let us hear first what you\npropose to do.\"\n\nPaul, upon this, explained that, as he believed the Stone still retained\nits power of granting one wish to any other person who happened to get\nhold of it, his idea was to get possession of it somehow from Dick, who\nprobably would have it about him somewhere, and then pass it on to some\none whom he could trust not to misuse it so basely.\n\n\"A good idea that, Paul, my boy,\" said Paradine, smiling; \"but you\ndon't imagine our young friend would be quite such an idiot as not to\nsee your game! Why, he would pitch the Stone in the gutter or stamp it\nto powder, rather than let you get hold of it.\"\n\n\"He's quite capable of it,\" said Paul; \"in fact, he threatened to do\nworse than that. I doubt if I shall ever be able to manage it myself;\nbut what am I to do? I must try, and I've no time to lose about it\neither.\"\n\n\"I tell you this,\" said Marmaduke, \"if you let him see you here, it's\nall up with you. What you want is some friend to manage this for you,\nsome one he won't suspect. Now, suppose I were willing to risk it for\nyou?\"\n\n\"You!\" cried Paul, with involuntary distrust.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Marmaduke, with a touch of feeling. \"Ah, I see, you\ncan't trust me. You've got an idea into your head that I'm a\nthorough-paced rascal, without a trace of human feeling about me. I\ndaresay I deserve it, I daresay I do; but it's not generous, my boy, for\nall that. I hope to show you your mistake yet, if you give me the\nchance. You allow yourself to be prejudiced by the past, that's where\nyou make your mistake. I only put before you clearly and plainly what it\nwas I was giving up in helping you. A fellow may have a hard cynical\nkind of way of putting things, and yet, take my word for it, Paul, have\na heart as tender as a spring chicken underneath. I believe I'm\nsomething like that myself. I tell you I'm sorry for you. I don't like\nto see a family man of your position in such a regular deuce of a hole.\nI feel bound to give you a lift out of it, and let my prospects take\ntheir own chance. I leave the gratitude to you. When I've done, kick me\ndown the doorsteps if you like. I shall go out into the world with the\nglow of self-approval (and rapid motion) warming my system. Take my\nadvice, don't attempt to tackle Master Dick yourself. Leave him to me.\"\n\n\"If I could only make up my mind to trust you!\" muttered Paul.\n\n\"The old distrust!\" cried Marmaduke; \"you can't forget. You won't\nbelieve a poor devil like me can have any gratitude, any\ndisinterestedness left in him. Never mind, I'll go. I'll leave it to\nyou. I'll send Dick in here, and we shall see whether he's such a fool\nas you think him.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"no; I feel you're right; that would never do.\"\n\n\"It would be for my advantage, I think,\" said the other, \"but you had\nbetter take me while I am in a magnanimous mood, the opportunity may\nnever occur again. Come, am I to help you or not? Yes or no?\"\n\n\"I must accept,\" said Paul reluctantly; \"I can't find Boaler now, and it\nmight take hours to make him see what I wanted. I'll trust to your\nhonour. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Do? Get away from this, he'll be coming in here very soon to see me.\nRun away and play with the children or hide in the china\ncloset--anything but stay here.\"\n\n\"I--I must be here while you are managing him,\" objected Paul.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Paradine angrily. \"I tell you it will spoil all, unless\nyou--who's that? it's his step--too late now--dash it all! Behind that\nscreen, quick--don't move for your life till I tell you you may come\nout!\"\n\nMr. Bultitude had no choice; there was just time to set up an old\nfolding screen which stood in a corner of the room and slip behind it\nbefore the door opened.\n\nIt might not be the highest wisdom to trust everything to his new ally\nin this manner; but what else could he do, except stand by in forced\ninactivity while the momentous duel was being fought out? Just then, at\nall events, he saw no other course.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18. _Run to Earth_\n\n     \"The is noon in this hous schuld bynde me this night.\"\n                                 --_The Coke's Tale of Gamelyn._\n\n\nDick burst open the door of the billiard-room rather suddenly, and then\nstood holding on to the handle and smiling down upon his relative in a\nhappy and affectionate but rather weak manner.\n\n\"So here you are!\" he said. \"Been lookin' for you everywhere. What's\ngood of shutting 'self in here? Come up and play gamesh. No? Come in and\nhave shupper. I've had shupper.\"\n\n\"So I perceive,\" observed Uncle Marmaduke; and the fact was certainly\nobvious enough.\n\n\"Tell y'what I did,\" giggled the wretched Dick. \"You know I never did\nget what I call regular good blow out--always some one to shay 'had\nquite 'nough' 'fore I'd begun. So I thought this time I would have a\ntuck-in till--till I felt tired, and I--he-he-he--I got down 'fore\nanybody elsh and helped myshelf. Had first go-in. No one to help to\nthingsh. No girlsh to bother. It was prime! When they've all gone up\nagain you and me'll go in and have shome more, eh?\"\n\n\"You're a model host,\" said his uncle.\n\n\"It's a good shupper,\" Dick went on. \"I ought to know. I've had some of\neverything. It'sh almost too good for kids. But it'sh a good thing I\nwent in first. After I'd been in a little time I saw a sponge-cake on\nthe table, and when I tried it, what d'ye think I found? It was as full\ninside of brandy-an'-sherry as it could be. All it could do to shtand! I\nsaw d'rectly it washn't in condition come to table, and I said, 'Take it\naway! take it away! It'sh drunk; it'sh a dishgraceful sight for\nchildren!' But they wouldn't take it away; sho I had to take it away.\nBut you can't take away a whole tipshy-cake!\"\n\n\"I am quite sure you did your best,\" murmured Paradine.\n\n\"Been having such gamesh upstairs!\" said Dick, with another giggle.\n\"That lil' Dolly Merridew's jolly girl. Not sho nice as Dulcie, though.\nHere, you, let'sh go up and let off fireworksh on balcony, eh? Letsh\nhave jolly lark!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said his uncle. \"You and I are too old for that sort of thing.\nYou should leave the larks to the young fellows.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm too old for sorterthing?\" said Dick, with an\noffended air.\n\n\"Well, you're not a young man any longer, you know. You ought to behave\nlike the steady old buffer you look.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Dick; \"why should I behave like shteady ole buffer, when\nI don't feel shteady ole buffer? What do you want shpoil fun for? Tell\nyou I shall do jus' zackly wharriplease. And, if you shay any more, I'll\npunch y' head!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said his uncle, slightly alarmed at this intimation. \"Come,\nyou're not going to quarrel with me, I'm sure!\"\n\n\"All ri',\" said Dick. \"No; I won' quarrel. Don' wanter quarrel anybody.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Paradine. \"I knew you were a noble fellow!\"\n\n\"Sho I am,\" said Dick, shaking hands with effusion. \"Sho are you. Nearly\nash noble 'sh me. There, you're jolly good fellow. I say, I've goo' mind\ntell you something. Make you laugh. But I won't; not now.\"\n\n\"Oh, you can tell me,\" said Marmaduke. \"No secrets between friends, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Shan't tell you now,\" said Dick. \"Keep shecret little longer.\"\n\n\"Do you know, my friend, that there's something very odd about you I've\nnoticed lately? Something that makes me almost fancy sometimes you're\nnot what you pretend to be.\"\n\nDick sat down heavily on one of the leather benches placed against the\nwall.\n\n\"Eh, what d'you shay?\" he gasped. \"Shay tharragain.\"\n\n\"You look to me,\" said Marmaduke slowly, \"like some one excellently made\nup for the part of heavy father, without a notion how to play it. Dick,\nyou young dog, you see I know you! You can't take me in with all this.\nYou'd better tell me all about it.\"\n\nDick seemed almost sobered by this shock.\n\n\"You've found me out,\" he repeated dully. \"Then it's all up. If you've\nfound me out, everybody elsh can find me out!\"\n\n\"No, no; it's not so bad as that, my boy. I've better eyes than most\npeople, and then I had the privilege of knowing your excellent father\nrather well once upon a time. You haven't studied his little\npeculiarities closely enough; but you'll improve. By the way, where _is_\nyour excellent father all this time?\"\n\n\"He's all right,\" said Dick, beginning to chuckle. \"He-he. He's at\nschool, he is!\"\n\n\"At school. You mean to say you've put him to school at his time of\nlife! He's rather old for that sort of thing, isn't he? They don't take\nhim on the ordinary terms, do they?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Dick, \"that'sh where it is. He isn't old, you see, now, to\nlook at.\"\n\n\"Not old to look at! Then how on earth---- I should like to know how you\nmanaged all that. What have you been doing to the poor gentleman?\"\n\n\"That'sh my affair,\" said Dick. \"An' if I don' tell you you won' find\nthat out anyway!\"\n\n\"There's only one way you could have done it,\" said Paradine, pretending\nto hesitate. \"It must have been done by some meddling with magic. Now\nwhat---- Let me see--yes---- Surely the Stone I brought your poor mother\nfrom India was given to me as a talisman of some sort? You can't have\nbeen sharp enough to get hold of that!\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" cried Dick sharply. \"Who told you?\"\n\n\"I am right, then? Well, you are a clever fellow. I should like to know\nhow you did it, now?\"\n\n\"Did it with the Shtone,\" said Dick, evidently discomposed by such\nunexpected penetration, but unable to prevent a little natural\ncomplacency. \"All my own idea. No one helped me. It--it washn't sho bad\nfor me, wash it?\"\n\n\"Bad! it was capital!\" cried Marmaduke enthusiastically. \"It was a\nstroke of genius! And so my Indian Stone has done all this for you.\nSounds like an Arabian Night, by Jove! By-the-by, you don't happen to\nhave it about you, do you? I should rather like to look at it again.\nIt's a real curiosity after this.\"\n\nPaul trembled with anxiety. Would Dick be induced to part with it? If\nso, he was saved! But Dick looked at his uncle's outstretched hand, and\nwagged his head with tipsy cunning.\n\n\"I dareshay you would,\" he said, \"but I'm not sho green as all that.\nDon't let that Stone out of my hands for anyone.\"\n\n\"Why, I only wanted to look at it for a minute or two,\" said Marmaduke;\n\"I wouldn't hurt it or lose it.\"\n\n\"You won' get chance,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Paradine carelessly, \"just as you please, it\ndoesn't matter; though when we come to talk things over a little, you\nmay find it better to trust me more than that.\"\n\n\"Wha' do you mean?\" said Dick uneasily.\n\n\"Well, I'll try to explain as well as I can, my boy (drink a little of\nthis soda water first, it's an excellent thing after supper); there,\nyou're better now, aren't you? Now, I've found you out, as you see; but\nonly because I knew something of the powers of this Stone of yours, and\nguessed the rest. It doesn't at all follow that other people, who know\nnothing at all, will be as sharp; if you're more careful about your\nbehaviour in future--unless, unless, young fellow----\" and here he\npaused meaningly.\n\n\"Unless what?\" asked Dick suspiciously.\n\n\"Unless I chose to tell them what I've found out.\"\n\n\"What would you tell them?\" said Dick.\n\n\"What? Why, what I know of this talisman; tell them to use their eyes;\nthey wouldn't be very long before they found out that something was\nwrong. And when one or two of your father's friends once get hold of the\nidea, your game will be very soon over--you know that as well as I do.\"\n\n\"But,\" stammered Dick, \"you wouldn't go and do beastly mean thing like\nthat? I've not been bad fellow to you.\"\n\n\"The meanness, my dear boy, depends entirely upon the view you take of\nit. Now, the question with me, as a man of honour (and I may tell you an\nover-nice sense of honour has been a drawback I've had to struggle\nagainst all my life), the question with me is this: Is it not my plain\nduty to step in and put a stop to this topsy-turvy state of things, to\nshow you up as the barefaced young impostor you are, and restore my\nunhappy brother-in-law to his proper position?\"\n\n\"Very well expressed,\" thought Paul, who had been getting uncomfortable;\n\"he has a heart, as he said, after all!\"\n\n\"How does that seem to strike you?\" added Paradine.\n\n\"It shtrikes me as awful rot,\" said Dick, with refreshing candour.\n\n\"It's the language of conscience, but I don't expect you to see it in\nthe same light. I don't mind confessing to you, either, that I'm a poor\ndevil to whom money and a safe and respectable position (all of which I\nhave here) are great considerations. But whenever I see the finger of\nduty and honour and family affection all beckoning me along a particular\nroad, I make a point of obeying their monitions--occasionally. I don't\nmean to say that I never have bolted down a back way, instead, when it\nwas made worth my while, or that I never will.\"\n\n\"I wonder what he's driving at now,\" thought Paul.\n\n\"I don't know about duty and honour, and all that,\" said Dick; \"my head\naches, it's the noise they're making upstairs. Are you goin' to tell?\"\n\n\"The fact is, my dear boy, that when one has had a keen sense of honour\nin constant use for several years, it's like most other articles, apt to\nbecome a little the worse for wear. Mine is not what it used to be,\nDicky (that's your name, isn't it?). Our powers fail as we grow old.\"\n\n\"I don' know what you're talking about!\" said Dick helplessly. \"Do tell\nme what you mean to do.\"\n\n\"Well then, your head's clear enough to understand this much, I hope,\"\nsaid Paradine a little impatiently, \"that, if I did my duty and exposed\nyou, you wouldn't be able to keep up the farce for a single hour, in\nspite of all your personal advantages--you know that, don't you?\"\n\n\"I shpose I know that,\" said Dick feebly.\n\n\"You know too, that if I could be induced--mind, I don't say I can--to\nhold my tongue and stay on here and look after you and keep you from\nbetraying yourself by any more of these schoolboy follies, there's not\nmuch fear that anyone else will ever find out the secret----\"\n\n\"Which are you going to do, then?\" said Dick.\n\n\"Suppose I say that I like you, that you have shown me more kindness in\na single week than ever your respectable father has since I first made\nhis acquaintance? Suppose I say that I am willing to let the sense of\nhonour and duty, and all the rest of it, go overboard together; that we\ntwo together are a match for Papa, wherever he may be and whatever he\nchooses to say and do?\"\n\nThere was a veiled defiance in his voice that seemed meant for more than\nDick, and alarmed Mr. Bultitude; however, he tried to calm his\nuneasiness and persuade himself that it was part of the plot.\n\n\"Will you say that?\" cried Dick excitedly.\n\n\"On one condition, which I'll tell you by-and-by. Yes, I'll stand by\nyou, my boy, I'll coach you till I make you a man of business every bit\nas good as your father, and a much better man of the world. I'll show\nyou how to realise a colossal fortune if you only take my advice. And\nwe'll pack Papa off to some place abroad where he'll have no holidays\nand give no trouble!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dick firmly; \"I won't have that. After all, he's my\ngovernor.\"\n\n\"Do what you like with him then, he can't do much harm. I tell you, I'll\ndo all this, on one condition--it's a very simple one----\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"This. You have, somewhere or other, the Stone that has done all this\nfor you--you may have it about you at this very moment--ah!\" (as Dick\nmade a sudden movement towards his white waistcoat) \"I thought so! Well,\nI want that Stone. You were afraid to leave it in my hands for a minute\nor two just now; you must trust me with it altogether.\"\n\nPaul was relieved; of course this was merely an artifice to recover the\nGarudÃ¢ Stone, and Marmaduke was not playing him false after all--he\nwaited breathlessly for Dick's answer.\n\n\"No,\" said Dick, \"I can't do that; I want it too.\"\n\n\"Why, man, what use is it to you? it only gives you one wish, you can't\nuse it again.\"\n\nDick mumbled something about his being ill, and Barbara wishing him well\nagain.\n\n\"I suppose I can do that as well as Barbara,\" said his uncle. \"Come,\ndon't be obstinate, give me the Stone; it's very important that it\nshould be in safe hands.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dick obstinately; he was fumbling all the time irresolutely\nin his pockets; \"I mean to keep it myself.\"\n\n\"Very well then, I have done with you. To-morrow morning I shall step up\nto Mincing Lane, and then to your father's solicitor. I think his\noffices are in Bedford Row, but I can easily find out at your father's\nplace. After that, young man, you'll have a very short time to amuse\nyourself in, so make the best of it.\"\n\n\"No, don't leave me, let me alone for a minute,\" pleaded Dick, still\nfumbling.\n\nAt this a sudden suspicion of his brother-in-law's motives for wishing\nto get the Stone into his own hands overcame all Paul's prudence. If he\nwas so clever in deceiving Dick, might he not be cheating _him_, too,\njust as completely? He could wait no longer, but burst from behind the\nscreen and rushed in between the pair.\n\n\"Go back!\" screamed Paradine. \"You infernal old idiot, you've ruined\neverything!\"\n\n\"I won't go back,\" said Paul, \"I don't believe in you. I'll hide no\nlonger. Dick, I forbid you to trust that man.\"\n\nDick had risen in horror at the sudden apparition, and staggered back\nagainst the wall, where he stood staring stupidly at his unfortunate\nfather with fixed and vacant eyes.\n\n\"Badly as you've treated me, I'd rather trust you than that shifty\nplausible fellow there. Just look at me, Dick, and then say if you can\nlet this cruelty go on. If you knew all I've suffered since I have been\namong those infernal boys, you would pity me, you would indeed.... If\nyou send me back there again, it will kill me.... You know as well as I\ndo that it is worse for me than ever it could be for you.... You can't\nreally justify yourself because of a thoughtless wish of mine, spoken\nwithout the least intention of being taken at my word. Dick, I may not\nhave shown as much affection for you as I might have done, but I don't\nthink I deserve all this. Be generous with me now, and I swear you will\nnever regret it.\"\n\nDick's lips moved; there really was something like pity and repentance\nin his face, muddled and dazed as his general expression was by his\nrecent over-indulgence, but he said nothing.\n\n\"Give papa the Stone by all means,\" sneered Paradine. \"If you do, he\nwill find some one to wish the pair of you back again, and then, back\nyou go to school again, the laughing-stock of everybody, you silly young\ncub!\"\n\n\"Don't listen to him, Dick,\" urged Paul. \"Give it to me, for Heaven's\nsake; if you let him have it, he'll use it to ruin us all.\"\n\nBut Dick turned his white face to the rival claimants and said, getting\nthe words out with difficulty: \"Papa, I'm shorry. It is a shame. If I\nhad the Shtone, I really would give it you, upon my word-an'-honour I\nwould. But--but, now I can't ever give it up to you. It'sh gone. Losht!\"\n\n\"Lost!\" cried Marmaduke. \"When, where? When do you last recollect seeing\nit? you must know!\"\n\n\"In the morning,\" said Dick, twirling his chain, where part of the cheap\ngilt fastening still hung.\n\n\"No; afternoon. I don't know,\" he added helplessly.\n\nPaul sank down on a chair with a heartbroken groan; a moment ago he had\nfelt himself very near his goal, he had regained something of his old\ninfluence over Dick, he had actually managed to touch his heart--and now\nit was all in vain!\n\nParadine's jaw fell; he, too, had had his dreams of doing wonderful\nthings with the talisman after he had cajoled Dick to part with it.\nWhether the restoration of his brother-in-law formed any part of his\nprogramme, it is better, perhaps, not to inquire. His dreams were\nscattered now; the Stone might be anywhere, buried in London mud, lying\non railway ballast, or ground to powder by cartwheels. There was little\nchance, indeed, that even the most liberal rewards would lead to\ndiscovery. He swore long and comprehensively.\n\nAs for Mr. Bultitude, he sat motionless in his chair, staring in dull,\nspeechless reproach at the conscience-stricken Dick, who stood in the\ncorner blinking and whimpering with an abject penitence, odd and painful\nto see in one of his portly form. The children had now apparently\nfinished supper, for there were sounds above as of dancing, and \"Sir\nRoger de Coverley,\" with its rollicking, never-wearying repetition, was\ndistinctly audible above the din and laughter. Once before, a week ago\nthat very day, had that heartless piano mocked him with its untimely\ngaiety.\n\nBut things were not at their worst even yet, for, while they sat like\nthis, there was a sharp, short peal at the house-bell, followed by loud\nand rather angry knocking, for carriages being no longer expected, the\nservants and waiters had now closed the front-door, and left the passage\nfor the supper-room.\n\n\"The visitors' bell!\" cried Paul, roused from his apathy; and he rushed\nto the window which commanded a side-view of the portico; it might be\nonly a servant calling for one of the children, but he feared the worst,\nand could not rest till he knew it.\n\nIt was a rash thing to do, for as he drew the blind, he saw a large\nperson in a heavy Inverness cloak standing on the steps, and (which was\nworse) the person both saw and recognised _him_!\n\nWith fascinated horror, Mr. Bultitude saw the Doctor's small grey eyes\nfixed angrily on him, and knew that he was hunted down at last.\n\nHe turned to the other two with a sort of ghastly composure: \"It's all\nover now,\" he said. \"I've just seen Dr. Grimstone standing on my\ndoorstep; he has come after me.\"\n\nUncle Marmaduke gave a malicious little laugh: \"I'm sorry for you, my\nfriend,\" he said, \"but I really can't help it.\"\n\n\"You can,\" said Paul; \"you can tell him what you know. You can save me.\"\n\n\"Very poor economy that,\" said Marmaduke airily. \"I prefer spending to\nsaving, always did. I have my own interests to consider, my dear Paul.\"\n\n\"Dick,\" said poor Mr. Bultitude, disgusted at this exhibition of\nselfishness, \"you said you were sorry just now. Will you tell him the\ntruth?\"\n\nBut Dick was quite unnerved, he cowered away, almost crying; \"I\ndaren't, I daren't,\" he stammered; \"I--I can't go back to the fellows\nlike this. I'm afraid to tell him. I--I want to hide somewhere.\"\n\nAnd certainly he was in no condition to convince an angry schoolmaster\nof anything whatever, except that he was in a state very unbecoming to\nthe head of a family.\n\nIt was all over; Paul saw that too well, he dashed frantically from the\nfatal billiard-room, and in the hall met Boaler preparing to admit the\nvisitor.\n\n\"Don't open the door!\" he screamed. \"Keep him out, you mustn't let him\nin. It's Dr. Grimstone.\"\n\nBoaler, surprised as he naturally was at his young master's\nunaccountable appearance and evident panic, nevertheless never moved a\nmuscle of his face; he was one of those perfectly bred servants, who, if\nthey chanced to open the door to a ghoul or a skeleton, would merely\ninquire, \"What name, if you please?\"\n\n\"I must go and ask your Par, then, Master Dick; there's time to 'ook it\nupstairs while I'm gone. I won't say nothing,\" he added compassionately.\n\nPaul lost no time in following this suggestion, but rushed upstairs, two\nor three steps at the time, stumbling at every flight, with a hideous\nnightmare feeling that some invisible thing behind was trying to trip up\nhis heels.\n\nHe rushed blindly past the conservatory, which was lit up by Chinese\nlanterns and crowded with little \"Kate Greenaway\" maidens crowned with\nfantastic headdresses out of the crackers, and comparing presents with\nboy-lovers; he upset perspiring waiters with glasses and trays, and\nscattered the children sitting on the stairs, as he bounded on in his\nreckless flight, leaving crashes of glass behind him.\n\nHe had no clear idea of what he meant to do; he thought of barricading\nhimself in his bedroom and hiding in the wardrobe; he had desperate\nnotions of getting on to the housetop by means of a step-ladder and the\nsky-light above the nursery landing; on one point he was resolved--he\nwould not be retaken _alive_!\n\nNever before in this commonplace London world of ours was an unfortunate\nhouseholder hunted up his own staircase in this distressing manner; even\nhis terror did not blind him to the extreme ignominy and injustice of\nhis position.\n\nAnd below he heard the bell ringing more and more impatiently, as the\nDoctor still remained on the wrong side of the door. In another minute\nhe must be admitted--and then!\n\nWho will not sympathise with Mr. Bultitude as he approaches the crisis\nof his misfortunes? I protest, for my own part, that as I am compelled\nto describe him springing from step to step in wild terror, like a\nhighly respectable chamois before some Alpine marksman, my own heart\nbleeds for him, and I hasten to end my distressing tale, and make the\nrest of it as little painful as I may with honesty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19. _The Reckoning_\n\n     MONTR.   The father is victorious.\n     BELF.                              Let us haste\n              To gratulate his conquest.\n     1ST CAPT.                          We to mourn\n              The fortune of the son.\n                        MASSINGER. _The Unnatural Combat._\n\n\nPoor Mr. Bultitude, springing wildly upstairs in a last desperate effort\nto avoid capture, had now almost reached his goal. Just above him was\nthe nursery landing, with its little wooden gate, and near it, leaning\nagainst the wall, was a pair of kitchen steps, with which he had hopes\nof reaching the roof, or the cistern loft, or some other safe and\ninaccessible place. Better a night spent on the slates amongst the\nchimney-pots than a bed in that terrible No. 6 Dormitory!\n\nBut here, too, fate was against him. He was not more than half-a-dozen\nsteps from the top, when, to his unspeakable horror, he saw a small form\nin a white frock and cardinal-red sash come running out of the nursery,\nand begin to descend slowly and cautiously, clinging to the banisters\nwith one chubby little hand.\n\nIt was his youngest son, Roly, and as soon as he saw this, he lost hope\nonce and for all; he could not escape being recognised, the child would\nprobably refuse to leave him, and even if he did contrive to get away\nfrom him, it would be hopeless to make Roly understand that he was not\nto betray his hiding-place.\n\nSo he stopped on the stairs, aghast at this new misfortune, and feeling\nhimself at the end of all his resources. Roly knew him at once, and\nbegan to dance delightedly up and down on the stair in his little bronze\nshoes. \"Buzzer Dicky,\" he cried, \"dear buzzer Dicky, tum 'ome to party!\"\n\n\"It's not brother Dicky,\" said Paul miserably; \"it's all a mistake.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is though,\" said Roly; \"and you don't know what Roly's\nfound.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Paul, trying to pass (which, as Roly persisted in leaping\njoyously from side to side of the narrow stair, was difficult); \"you\nshall show me another time. I'm in a hurry, my boy, I've got an\nappointment.\"\n\n\"Roly's got something better than that,\" observed the child.\n\nMr. Bultitude, in spite of his terror, was too much afraid of hurting\nhim by brushing roughly past to attempt such a thing, so he tried\ndiplomacy. \"Well, what has Roly found--a cracker?\"\n\n\"No, no, better than a cwacker--you guess.\"\n\n\"I can't guess,\" said Paul; \"never mind, I don't want to know.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Roly, \"there.\" And he slowly unclosed a fat little\nfist, and in it Paul saw, with a revulsion of feeling that turned him\ndizzy and faint, the priceless talisman itself, the identical GarudÃ¢\nStone, with part of the frail gilt ring still attached to it.\n\nThe fastening had probably given way during Master Dick's uproarious\nrevels in the drawing-room, and Roly must have picked it up on the\ncarpet shortly afterwards.\n\n\"Isn't it a pitty sing?\" said Roly, insisting that his treasure should\nbe duly admired.\n\n\"A very pretty thing,\" said his father, hoarse and panting; \"but it's\nmine, Roly, it's mine!\"\n\nAnd he tried to snatch it, but Roly closed his fist over it and pouted,\n\"It isn't yours,\" he said, \"it's Roly's. Roly found it.\"\n\nPaul's fears rose again; would he be wrecked in port after all? His ear,\nunnaturally strained, caught the sound of the front door being opened,\nhe heard the Doctor's deep voice booming faintly below, then the noise\nof persons ascending.\n\n\"Roly shall have it, then,\" he said perfidiously, \"if he will say after\nme what I tell him. Say, 'I wish Papa and Brother Dick back as they were\nbefore,' Roly.\"\n\n\"Ith it a game?\" asked Roly, his face clearing and evidently delighted\nwith his eccentric brother Dick, who had run all the way home from\nschool to play games with him on the staircase.\n\n\"No--yes!\" cried Paul, \"it's a very funny game; only do what I tell you.\nNow say, 'I wish Papa and Brother Dick back again as they were before.'\nI'll give you a sugar-plum if you say it nicely.\"\n\n\"What sort of sugar-plum?\" demanded Roly, who inherited business\ninstincts.\n\n\"Any sort you like best!\" almost shrieked Paul; \"oh, do get on!\"\n\n\"Lots of sugar-plums, then. 'I with'--I forget what you told me--oh, 'I\nwith Papa and----' there'th thomebody tummin' upsthairs!\" he broke off\nsuddenly; \"it'h nurth tummin' to put me to bed. I don't want to go to\nbed yet.\"\n\n\"And you shan't go to bed!\" cried Paul, for he too thought he heard\nsome one. \"Never mind nurse, finish the--the game.\"\n\n--'Papa and Buzzy Dicky back again as--as they were before,' repeated\nRoly at last. \"What a funny--ow, ow, it'h Papa! it'h Papa! and he told\nme it wath Dicky. I'm afwaid! Whereth Dicky gone to? I want Bab, take me\nto Bab!\"\n\nFor the Stone had done its work once more, and this time with happier\nresults; with a supreme relief and joy, which no one who has read this\nbook can fail to understand, Mr. Bultitude felt that he actually was his\nold self again.\n\nJust when all hope seemed cut off and relief was most unlikely, the\nmagic spell that had caused him such intolerable misery for one hideous\nweek was reversed by the hand of his innocent child.\n\nHe caught Roly up in his arms and kissed him as he had never been kissed\nin his whole life before, at least by his father, and comforting him as\nwell as he could, for the poor child had naturally received rather a\nsevere shock, he stepped airily down the staircase, which he had mounted\nwith such different emotions five minutes before.\n\nOn his way he could not resist going into his dressing-room and assuring\nhimself by a prolonged examination before the cheval-glass that the\nStone had not played him some last piece of jugglery; but he found\neverything quite correct; he was the same formal, precise and portly\nperson, wearing the same morning dress even as on that other Monday\nevening, and he went on with greater confidence.\n\nHe took care, however, to stop at the first window, when he managed,\nafter some coaxing, to persuade Roly to give up the GarudÃ¢ Stone. As\nsoon as he had it in his hands again, he opened the window wide and\nflung the dangerous talisman far out into the darkness. Not till then\ndid he feel perfectly secure.\n\nHe passed the groups of little guests gathered about the conservatory,\nand lower down he met Boaler, the nurse, and one or two servants and\nwaiters, rushing up in a state of great anxiety and flurry; even\nBoaler's usual composure seemed shaken. \"Please, sir,\" he asked, \"the\nschoolmaster gentleman, Master Dick--he've run upstairs, haven't you\nseen him?\"\n\nPaul had almost forgotten Dick in his new happiness; there would be a\nheavy score to settle with him; he had the upper hand once more, and\nyet, somehow, he did not feel as much righteous wrath and desire for\nrevenge as he expected to do.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" he said, waving them back with more benignity than\nhe thought he had in him. \"Master Dick is safe enough. I know all about\nit. Where is Dr. Grimstone? In the library, eh? Very well, I will see\nhim there.\"\n\nAnd leaving Roly with the nurse, he went down to the library; not, if\nthe truth must be told, without a slight degree of nervousness,\nunreasonable and unaccountable enough now, but quite beyond his power to\ncontrol.\n\nHe entered the room, and there, surrounded by piles of ticketed hats and\ncoats, under the pale light of one gas-burner, he saw the terrible man\nbefore whom he had trembled for the last seven horrible days.\n\nA feeling of self-defence made Paul assume rather more than his old\nstiffness as he shook hands. \"I am very glad to see you, Dr. Grimstone,\"\nhe said, \"but your coming at this time forces me to ask if there is any\nunusual reason for, for my having the--a--pleasure of seeing you here?\"\n\n\"I am exceedingly distressed to have to say that there is,\" said the\nDoctor solemnly, \"or I should not have troubled you at this hour. Try to\ncompose yourself, my dear sir, to bear this blow.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Paul, \"I will try.\"\n\n\"The fact is then, and I know how sad a story it must be for a parent's\near, but the fact is, that your unhappy boy has had the inconceivable\nrashness to quit my roof.\" And the Doctor paused to watch the effect of\nhis announcement.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" cried Paul. \"You don't say so!\"\n\n\"I do indeed; he has, in short, run away. But don't be alarmed, my dear\nMr. Bultitude, I think I can assure you he is quite safe at the present\nmoment\" (\"Thank Heaven, he is!\" thought Paul, thinking of his own\nmarvellous escape). \"I should certainly have recaptured him before he\ncould have left the railway station, where he seems to have gone at\nonce, only, acting on information (which I strongly suspect now was\nintentionally misleading), I drove on to the station on the up-line,\nthinking to find him there. He was not there, sir, I believe he never\nwent there at all; but, guessing how matters were, I searched the train,\ncarriage by carriage, compartment by compartment, when it came up.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry you should have had so much trouble,\" said Paul, with a\nvivid recollection of the exploring stick; \"and so you found him?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said the Doctor passionately, \"I did not find him, but he was\nthere; he must have been there! but the shameless connivance of two\nexcessively ill-bred persons, who positively refused to allow me access\nto their compartment, caused him to slip through my fingers.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude observed, rather ungratefully, that, if this was so, it\nwas a most improper thing for them to do.\n\n\"It was, indeed, but it is of no consequence fortunately. I was forced\nto wait for the next train, but that was not a very slow one, and so I\nwas able to come on here before a very late hour and acquaint you with\nwhat had taken place.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Paul.\n\n\"It's a painful thing to occur in a school,\" observed the Doctor after a\npause.\n\n\"Most unfortunate,\" agreed Paul, coughing.\n\n\"So apt to lead persons who are not acquainted with the facts to imagine\nthat the boy was unhappy under my care,\" continued the Doctor.\n\n\"In this case, I assure you, I have no doubts,\" protested Paul with\npoliteness and (seldom a possible combination) perfect truth.\n\n\"Very kind of you to say so; really, it's a great mystery to me. I\ncertainly, as I felt it my duty to inform you at the time, came very\nnear inflicting corporal punishment upon him this morning--very near.\nBut then he was pardoned on your intercession; and, besides, the boy\nwould never have run away for fear of a flogging.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, perfectly absurd!\" agreed Paul again.\n\n\"Such a merry, high-spirited lad, too,\" said the Doctor, sincerely\nenough; \"popular with his schoolfellows; a favourite (in spite of his\nfaults) with his teachers.\"\n\n\"No, was he though?\" said Paul with more surprise, for he had not been\nfortunate enough to reap much vicarious benefit from his son's\npopularity, as he could not help remembering.\n\n\"All this, added to the comforts (or, may I say, the luxuries?) he\nenjoyed under my supervision, does make it seem very strange and\nungrateful in the boy to take this sudden and ill-considered step.\"\n\n\"Very, indeed; but do you know, Dr. Grimstone, I can't help\nthinking--and pray do not misunderstand me if I speak plainly--that,\nperhaps, he had reasons for being unhappy you can have no idea of?\"\n\n\"He would have found me ready to hear any complaints and prompt to\nredress them, sir,\" said the Doctor. \"But, now I think of it, he\ncertainly did appear to have something on his mind which he wished to\ntell me; but his manner was so strange and he so persistently refused to\ncome to the point, that I was forced to discourage him at last.\"\n\n\"You did discourage him, indeed!\" said Paul inwardly, thinking of those\nattempted confidences with a shudder. \"Perhaps some of his schoolfellows\nmay have--eh?\" he said aloud.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" exclaimed the Doctor, \"quite out of the question!\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Paul, not being able to resist the suggestion.\n\"And yet, do you know, some of them did not appear to me to look\nvery--very good-natured, now.\"\n\n\"A more manly, pleasant, and gentlemanly set of youths never breathed!\"\nsaid the Doctor, taking up the cudgels for his boys, and, to do him\njustice, probably with full measure of belief in his statement. \"Curious\nnow that they should have struck you so differently!\"\n\n\"They certainly did strike me very differently,\" said Paul. \"But I may\nbe mistaken.\"\n\n\"You are, my dear sir. And, pardon me, but you had no opportunity of\ntesting your opinion.\"\n\n\"Oh, pardon me,\" retorted Paul grimly, \"I had indeed!\"\n\n\"A cursory visit,\" said the Doctor, \"a formal inspection--you cannot\nfairly judge boys by that. They will naturally be reserved and\nconstrained in the presence of an elder. But you should observe them\nwithout their knowledge--you want to know them, my dear Mr. Bultitude,\nyou want to go among them!\"\n\nIt was the very last thing Paul did want--he knew them quite well\nenough, but it was of no use to say so, and he merely assented politely.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Doctor, \"with regard to your misguided boy. I have\nto tell you that he is here, in this very house. I tracked him here,\nand, ten minutes ago, saw him with my own eyes at one of your windows.\n\n\"Here!\" cried Paul, with a well-executed start; \"you astonish me!\"\n\n\"It has occurred to me within the last minute,\" said the Doctor, \"that\nthere may be a very simple explanation of his flight. I observe you are\ngiving a--a juvenile entertainment on a large scale.\"\n\n\"I suppose I am,\" Paul admitted. \"And so you think----?\"\n\n\"I think that your son, who doubtless knew of your intention, was hurt\nat being excluded from the festivities and, in a fit of mad wilful\nfolly, resolved to be present at them in spite of you.\"\n\n\"My dear Doctor,\" cried Paul, who saw the conveniences of this theory,\n\"that must be it, of course--that explains it all!\"\n\n\"So grave an act of insubordination,\" said the Doctor, \"an act of double\ndisobedience--to your authority and mine--deserves the fullest\npunishment. You agree with me, I trust?\"\n\nThe memory of his wrongs overcame Mr. Bultitude for the moment: \"Nothing\ncan be too bad for the little scoundrel!\" he said, between his teeth.\n\n\"He shall have it, sir, I swear to you; he shall be made to repent this\nas long as he lives. This insult to me (and of course to you also) shall\nbe amply atoned for. If you will have the goodness to deliver him over\nto my hands, I will carry him back at once to Market Rodwell, and\nto-morrow, sir, to-morrow, I will endeavour to awaken his conscience in\na way he will remember!\"\n\nThe Doctor was more angry than an impartial lover of justice might\nperhaps approve of, but then it must be remembered that he had seen\nhimself completely outwitted and his authority set at nought in a very\nhumiliating fashion.\n\nHowever, his excessive wrath cooled Paul's own resentment instead of\ninflaming it; it made him reflect that, after all, it was he who had the\nbest right to be angry.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, rather coldly, \"we must find him first, and then\nconsider what shall be done to him. If you will allow me I will ring\nand----\"\n\nBut before he could lay his hand upon the bell the library door opened,\nand Uncle Marmaduke made his appearance, dragging with him the unwilling\nDick: the unfortunate boy was effectually sobered now, pale and\ntrembling and besmirched with coal-dust--in fact, in very much the same\nplight as his ill-used father had been in only three hours ago.\n\nThere was a brazen smile of triumph on Mr. Paradine's face as he met\nPaul's eyes with a knowing wink, which the latter did not at all\nunderstand.\n\nSuch audacity astonished him, for he could hardly believe that Paradine,\nafter his perfidious conduct in the billiard-room, could have the clumsy\nimpudence to try to propitiate him now.\n\n\"Here he is, my boy,\" shouted Paradine; \"here's the scamp who has given\nus all this trouble! He came into the billiard-room just now and told me\nwho he was, but I would have nothing to do with him of course. Not my\nbusiness, as I told him at the time. Then--(I think I have the pleasure\nof seeing Dr. Grimstone? just so) well, then you, sir, arrived--and he\nmade himself scarce. But when I saw him in the act of making a bolt up\nthe area, where he had been taking shelter apparently in the\ncoal-cellar, I thought it was time to interfere, and so I collared him.\nI have much pleasure in handing him over now to the proper authorities.\"\n\nAnd, letting Dick go, he advanced towards his brother-in-law, still with\nthe same odd expression of having a secret understanding with him, which\nmade Paul's blood boil.\n\n\"Stand where you are, sir,\" said Paul to his son. \"No, Dr. Grimstone,\nallow me--leave him to me for the present, please.\"\n\n\"That's much better,\" whispered Paradine approvingly; \"capital. Keep it\nup, my boy; keep it up! Papa's as quiet as a lamb now. Go on.\"\n\nThen Paul understood; his worthy brother-in-law had not been present at\nthe last transformation and was under a slight misapprehension: he\nevidently imagined that he had by this last stroke made himself and Dick\nmasters of the situation--it was time to undeceive him.\n\n\"Have the goodness to leave my house at once, will you!\" he said\nsternly.\n\n\"You young fool!\" said Marmaduke, under his breath, \"after all I have\ndone for you, too! Is this your gratitude? You know you can't get on\nwithout me. Take care what you're about!\"\n\n\"If you can't see that the tables are turned at last,\" said Paul slowly,\n\"you're a duller knave than I take you to be.\"\n\nMarmaduke started back with an oath: \"It's a trick,\" he said savagely;\n\"you want to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"I certainly intend to,\" said Paul. \"Are you satisfied? Do you want\nproofs--shall I give them--I did just now in the billiard-room?\"\n\nParadine went to Dick and shook him angrily: \"You young idiot!\" he said,\nin a furious aside, \"why didn't you tell me? What did you let me make a\nfool of myself like this for, eh?\"\n\n\"I did tell you,\" muttered Dick, \"only you wouldn't listen. It just\nserves you right!\"\n\nMarmaduke soon collected himself after this unexpected shock; he tried\nto shake Paul's hands with an airy geniality. \"Only my little joke,\" he\nsaid, laughing; \"ha, ha, I thought I should take you in!... Why, I knew\nit directly.... I've been working for you all the time--but it wouldn't\nhave done to let you see my line.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Paul; \"it was not a very straight one, as usual.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Marmaduke, \"I shouldn't have stopped Master Dick there if I\nhadn't been on your side, should I now? I knew you'd come out of it all\nright, but I had a difficult game to play, don't you know? I don't\nwonder that you didn't follow me just at first.\"\n\n\"You've lost your game,\" said Paul; \"it's no use to say any more. So\nnow, perhaps, you'll go?\"\n\n\"Go, eh?\" said Paradine, without showing much surprise at the failure\nof so very forlorn a hope, \"oh, very well, just as you please, of\ncourse. Let your poor wife's only brother go from your doors without a\npenny in the world!--but I warn you that a trifle or so laid out in\nstopping my mouth would not be thrown away. Some editors would be glad\nenough of a sensation from real life just now, and I could tell some\nvery odd tales about this little affair!\"\n\n\"Tell them, if a character for sanity is of no further use to you,\" said\nPaul. \"Tell them to anyone you can get to believe you--tell the\ncrossing-sweeper and the policemen, tell your grandmother, tell the\nhorse-marines--it will amuse them. Only, you shall tell them on the\nother side of my front door. Shall I call anyone to show you out?\"\n\nParadine saw his game was really played out, and swaggered insolently to\nthe door: \"Not on my account, I beg,\" he said. \"Good-bye, Paul, my boy,\nno more dissolving views. Good-bye, my young friend Richard, it was good\nfun while it lasted, eh? like the Servian crown--always a pleasant\nreminiscence! Good evening to you, Doctor. By the way, for educational\npurposes let me recommend a 'Penang lawyer'--buy one as you go back for\nthe boys--just to show them you haven't forgotten them!\"\n\nAnd, having little luggage to impede him, the front door closed upon him\nshortly afterwards--this time for ever.\n\nWhen he had gone, Dick looked imploringly at his father and then at the\nDoctor, who, until Paradine's parting words had lashed him into fury\nagain, had been examining the engravings on the walls with a studied\ndelicacy during the recent painful scene, and was now leaning against\nthe chimney-piece with his arms folded and a sepulchral gloom on his\nbrow.\n\n\"Richard,\" said Mr. Bultitude, in answer to the look, \"you have not done\nmuch to deserve consideration at my hands.\"\n\n\"Or at mine!\" added the Doctor ominously.\n\n\"No,\" said Dick, \"I know I haven't. I've been a brute. I deserve a jolly\ngood licking.\"\n\n\"You do,\" said his father, but in spite of his indignation, the\nbroken-down look of the boy, and the memory of his own sensations when\nwaiting to be caned that morning, moved him to pity. And then Dick had\nshown some compunction in the billiard-room: he was not entirely lost to\nfeeling.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"you've acted very wrongly. Because I thought\nit best that you should not--ahem, leave your studies for this party,\nyou chose to disobey me and alarm your master by defying my orders and\ncoming home by stealth--that was your object, I presume?\"\n\n\"Y--yes,\" said Dick, looking rather puzzled, but seeing that he was\nexpected to agree; \"that was it.\"\n\n\"You know as well as I do what good cause I have to be angry; but, if I\nconsent to overlook your conduct this time, if I ask Dr. Grimstone to\noverlook it too\" (the Doctor made an inarticulate protest, while Dick\nstared, incredulous), \"will you undertake to behave better for the\nfuture--will you?\"\n\nDick's voice broke at this, and his eyes swam--he was effectually\nconquered. \"Oh, I will!\" he cried, \"I will, really. I never meant to go\nso far when I began.\"\n\n\"Then, Dr. Grimstone,\" said Paul, \"you will do me a great favour if you\nwill take no further notice of this. You see the boy is sorry, and I am\nsure he will apologise to you amply for the grave slight he has done\nyou. And by the way--I should have mentioned it before--but he will have\nto leave your care at the end of the term for a public school--I intend\nto send him to Harrow, so he will require some additional preparation,\nperhaps: I may leave that in your hands?\"\n\nDr. Grimstone looked deeply offended, but he only said, \"I will see to\nthat myself, my dear sir. I am sorry you did not tell me this earlier.\nBut, may I suggest that a large public school has its pitfalls for a\nboy of your son's disposition? And I trust this leniency may not have\nevil consequences, but I doubt it--I greatly doubt it.\"\n\nAs for Dick, he ran to his father, and hung gratefully on to his arm\nwith a remorseful hug, a thing he had never dared to do, or thought of\nattempting, in his life till then.\n\n\"Dad,\" he said in a choked voice, \"you're a brick! I don't deserve any\nof it, but I'll never forget this as long as I live.\"\n\nMr. Bultitude too, felt something spring up in his heart which drew him\ntowards the boy in an altogether novel manner, but no one will say that\neither was the worse for it.\n\n\"Well,\" he said mildly, \"prove to me that I have made no mistake. Go\nback to Crichton House now, work and play well, and try to keep out of\nmischief for the rest of the term. I trust to you,\" he added, in a lower\ntone, \"while you remain at Market Rodwell, to keep my--my connection\nwith it a secret; you owe that at least to me. You may probably\nhave--ahem, some inconveniences to put up with--inconveniences you are\nnot prepared for. You must bear them as your punishment.\"\n\nAnd soon afterwards a cab was called, and Dr. Grimstone prepared to\nreturn to Market Rodwell, with the deserter, by the last train.\n\nAs Paul shook hands through the cab window with his prodigal son, he\nrepeated his warning. \"Mind,\" he said, \"_you_ have been at school all\nthis past week; you have run away to attend this party, you understand?\nGood-bye, my boy, and here's something to put in your pocket, and\nanother for Jolland; but he need not know it comes from me.\" And when\nDick opened his hand afterwards, he found two half-sovereigns in it.\n\nSo the cab rolled away, and Paul went up to the drawing-room, where,\nalthough he certainly allowed the fireworks on the balcony and in the\ngarden to languish forgotten on their sticks, he led all the other\nrevels up to an advanced hour with jovial _abandon_ quite worthy of\nDick, and none of his little guests ever suspected the change of host.\n\nWhen it was all over, and the sleepy children had driven off, Paul sat\ndown in an easy chair by the bright fire which sparkled frostily in his\nbedroom, to think gratefully over all the events of the day--events\nwhich were beginning already to take an unreal and fantastic shape.\n\nBitterly as he had suffered, and in spite of the just anger and thirst\nfor revenge with which he had returned, I am glad to say he did not\nregret the spirit of mildness that had stayed his hand when his hour of\ntriumph came.\n\nHis experiences, unpleasant as they had been, had had their advantages:\nthey had drawn him and his family closer together.\n\nIn his daughter Barbara, as she wished him good-night (knowing nothing,\nof course, of the escape), he had suddenly become aware of a girlish\nfreshness and grace he had never looked for or cared to see before. Roly\nafter this, too, had a claim upon him he could never wish to forget, and\neven with the graceless Dick there was a warmer and more natural feeling\non both sides--a strange result, no doubt, of such unfilial behaviour,\nbut so it was.\n\nMr. Bultitude would never after this consider his family as a set of\ntroublesome and thankless incumbrances; thanks to Dick's offices during\nthe interregnum, they would henceforth throw off their reserve and\nconstraint in their father's presence, and in so doing, open his eyes to\nqualities of which he had hitherto been in contented ignorance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt would be pleasanter perhaps to take leave of Mr. Bultitude thus, as\nhe sits by his bedroom fire in the first flush of supreme and unalloyed\ncontent.\n\nBut I feel almost bound to point out a fact which few will find any\ndifficulty in accepting, namely, that, although the wrong had been\nretrieved without scandal or exposure, for which Paul could not be too\nthankful, there were many consequences which could not but survive it.\n\nNeither father nor son found himself exactly in the same position as\nbefore their exchange of characters.\n\nIt took Mr. Bultitude considerable time and trouble to repair all the\ndamage his son's boyish excesses had wrought both at Westbourne Terrace\nand in the City. He found the discipline of his clerks' room and\ncounting-house sorely relaxed, and his office-boy in particular\nattempted a tone towards him of such atrocious familiarity that he was\nindignantly dismissed, much to his astonishment, the very first day. And\nprobably Paul will never quite clear himself of the cloud that hangs\nover a man of business who, in the course of however well regulated a\ncareer, is known to have been at least once \"a little odd.\"\n\nAnd his home, too, was distinctly demoralised: his cook was an artist,\nunrivalled at soups and entrÃ©es; but he had to get rid of her\nnotwithstanding.\n\nIt was only too evident that she looked upon herself as the prospective\nmistress of his household, and he did not feel called upon as a parent\nto fulfil any expectations which Dick's youthful cupboard love had\nunintentionally excited.\n\nFor some time, as fresh proof of Dick's extravagances came home to him,\nPaul found it cost him no little effort to restrain a tendency to his\nformer bitterness and resentment, but he valued the new understanding\nbetween himself and his son too highly to risk losing it again by any\nopen reproach, and so with each succeeding discovery the victory over\nhis feelings became easier.\n\nAs for Dick, he found the inconveniences at which his father had hinted\nanything but imaginary, as will perhaps be easily understood.\n\nIt was an unpleasant shock to discover that in one short week his\nfather had contrived somehow to procure him a lasting unpopularity. He\nwas obviously looked upon by all, masters and boys, as a confirmed\ncoward and sneak. And although some of his companions could not fairly\nreproach him on the latter score, the imputation was particularly\ngalling to Dick, who had always treated such practices with sturdy\ncontempt.\n\nHe was sorely tempted at times to right himself by declaring the real\nstate of the case; but he remembered his promise and his father's\nunexpected clemency and his gratitude always kept him silent.\n\nHe never quite understood how it was that the whole school seemed to\nhave an impression that they could kick and assault him generally with\nperfect impunity; but a few very unsuccessful experiments convinced them\nthat this was a popular error on their part.\n\nAlthough, however, in everything else he did gradually succeed in\nrecovering all the ground his father had lost him, yet there was one\nrespect in which, I am sorry to say, he found all his efforts to\nretrieve himself hopeless.\n\nHis little sweetheart, with the grey eyes and soft brown hair, cruelly\nrefused to have anything more to do with him. For Dulcie's pride had\nbeen wounded by what she considered his shameless perfidy on that\nmemorable Saturday by the parallel bars; the last lingering traces of\naffection had vanished before Paul's ingratitude on the following\nMonday, and she never forgave him.\n\nShe did not even give him an opportunity of explaining himself, never by\nword or sign up to the last day of the term showing that she was even\naware of his return. What was worse, in her resentment she transferred\nher favour to Tipping, who became her humble slave for a too brief\nperiod; after which he was found wanting in polish, and was\nignominiously thrown over for the shy new boy Kiffin, whose head Dick\nfound a certain melancholy pleasure in punching in consequence.\n\nThis was Dick's punishment, and a very real and heavy one he found it.\nHe is at Harrow now, where he is doing fairly well; but I think there\nare moments even yet when Dulcie's charming little face, her pretty\nconfidences, and her chilling disdain, are remembered with something as\nnearly resembling a heartache as a healthy unsentimental boy can allow\nhimself.\n\nPerhaps, if some day he goes back once more to Crichton House \"to see\nthe fellows,\" this time with the mysterious glamour of a great public\nschool about him, he may yet obtain forgiveness, for she is getting\nhorribly tired of Kiffin, who, to tell the truth, is something of a\nmilksop.\n\nAs for the GarudÃ¢ Stone, I really cannot say what has become of it.\nPerhaps it was dashed to pieces on the cobble-stones of the stables\nbehind the terrace, and a good thing too. Perhaps it was not, and is\nstill in existence, with all its dangerous powers as ready for use as\never it was; and in that case the best I can wish my readers is, that\nthey may be mercifully preserved from finding it anywhere, or if they\nare unfortunate enough to come upon it, that they may at least be more\ncareful with it than Mr. Paul Bultitude, by whose melancholy example I\ntrust they will take timely warning.\n\nAnd with these very sincere wishes I beg to bid them a reluctant\nfarewell.\n\n\n",
