Whether I have succeeded or not, is for\n    others to judge.\"\n                                        Sir William Temple.\n\n\nThe minds of young people are now manufactured like webs of linen, all\nalike, and nothing left to nature. From the hour when children can\nspeak, till they come to years of discretion or of indiscretion, they\nare carefully prompted what to say, and what to think, and what to look,\nand how to feel; while in most school-rooms nature has been turned out\nof doors with obloquy, and art has entirely supplanted her.\n\nWhen a quarrel takes place, both parties are generally in some degree to\nblame; therefore if Art and Nature could yet be made to go hand in hand\ntowards the formation of character and principles, a graceful and\nbeautiful superstructure might be reared, on the solid foundation of\nChristian faith and sound morality; so that while many natural weeds and\nwild flowers would be pruned and carefully trained, some lovely blossoms\nthat spring spontaneously in the uncultivated soil, might still be\ncherished into strength and beauty, far excelling what can be planted or\nreared by art.\n\nEvery infant is probably born with a character as peculiar to himself as\nthe features in his countenance, if his faults and good qualities were\npermitted to expand according to their original tendency; but education,\nwhich formerly did too little in teaching \"the young idea how to shoot,\"\nseems now in danger of over-shooting the mark altogether, by not\nallowing the young ideas to exist at all. In this age of wonderful\nmechanical inventions, the very mind of youth seems in danger of\nbecoming a machine; and while every effort is used to stuff the memory,\nlike a cricket-ball, with well-known facts and ready-made opinions, no\nroom is left for the vigour of natural feeling, the glow of natural\ngenius, and the ardour of natural enthusiasm. It was a remark of Sir\nWalter Scott's many years ago, to the author herself, that in the rising\ngeneration there would be no poets, wits, or orators, because all play\nof imagination is now carefully discouraged, and books written for young\npersons are generally a mere dry record of facts, unenlivened by any\nappeal to the heart, or any excitement to the fancy. The catalogue of a\nchild's library would contain Conversations on Natural Philosophy,--on\nChemistry,--on Botany,--on Arts and Sciences,--Chronological Records of\nHistory,--and travels as dry as a road-book; but nothing on the habits\nor ways of thinking, natural and suitable to the taste of children;\ntherefore, while such works are delightful to the parents and teachers\nwho select them, the younger community are fed with strong meat instead\nof milk, and the reading which might be a relaxation from study, becomes\na study in itself.\n\nIn these pages the author has endeavoured to paint that species of\nnoisy, frolicsome, mischievous children which is now almost extinct,\nwishing to preserve a sort of fabulous remembrance of days long past,\nwhen young people were like wild horses on the prairies, rather than\nlike well-broken hacks on the road; and when, amidst many faults and\nmany eccentricities, there was still some individuality of character and\nfeeling allowed to remain. In short, as Lord Byron described \"the last\nman,\" the object of this volume is, to describe \"the last boy.\" It may\nbe useful, she thinks, to show, that amidst much requiring to be\njudiciously curbed and corrected, there may be the germs of high and\ngenerous feeling, and of steady, right principle, which should be the\nchief objects of culture and encouragement. Plodding industry is in the\npresent day at a very high premium in education; but it requires the\nleaven of mental energy and genius to make it work well, while it has\nbeen remarked by one whose experience in education is deep and\npractical, that \"those boys whose names appear most frequently in the\nblack book of transgression, would sometimes deserve to be also most\ncommonly recorded, if a book were kept for warm affections and generous\nactions.\"\n\nThe most formidable person to meet in society at present, is the mother\nof a promising boy, about nine or ten years old; because there is no\npossible escape from a volume of anecdotes, and a complete system of\neducation on the newest principles. The young gentleman has probably\nasked leave to bring his books to the breakfast-room,--can scarcely be\ntorn away from his studies at the dinner-hour,--discards all\ntoys,--abhors a holiday,--propounds questions of marvellous depth in\npolitics or mineralogy,--and seems, in short, more fitted to enjoy the\nlearned meeting at Newcastle, than the exhilarating exercises of the\ncricket-ground; but, if the axiom be true, that \"a little learning is a\ndangerous thing,\" it has also been proved by frequent, and sometimes by\nvery melancholy experience, that, for minds not yet expanded to\nmaturity, a great deal of learning is more dangerous still, and that in\nthose school-rooms where there has been a society for the suppression of\namusement, the mental energies have suffered, as well as the health.\n\nA prejudice has naturally arisen against giving works of fiction to\nchildren, because their chief interest too often rests on the detection\nand punishment of such mean vices as lying and stealing, which are so\nfrequently and elaborately described, that the way to commit those\ncrimes is made obvious, while a clever boy thinks he could easily avoid\nthe oversights by which another has been discovered, and that if he does\nnot yield to similar temptations, he is a model of virtue and\ngood-conduct.\n\nIn writing for any class of readers, and especially in occupying the\nleisure moments of such peculiarly fortunate young persons as have\nleisure moments at all, the author feels conscious of a deep\nresponsibility, for it is at their early age that the seed can best be\nsown which shall bear fruit unto eternal life, therefore it is hoped\nthis volume may be found to inculcate a pleasing and permanent\nconsciousness, that religion is the best resource in happier hours, and\nthe only refuge in hours of affliction.\n\nThose who wish to be remembered for ever in the world,--and it is a very\ncommon object of ambition,--will find no monument more permanent, than\nthe affectionate remembrance of any children they have treated with\nkindness; for we may often observe, in the reminiscences of old age, a\ntender recollection surviving all others, of friends in early days who\nenlivened the hours of childhood by presents of playthings and comfits.\nBut above all, we never forget those who good-humouredly complied with\nthe constantly recurring petition of all young people in every\ngeneration, and in every house--\"Will you tell me a story?\"\n\nIn answer to such a request, often and importunately repeated, the\nauthor has from year to year delighted in seeing herself surrounded by a\ncircle of joyous, eager faces, listening with awe to the terrors of Mrs.\nCrabtree, or smiling at the frolics of Harry and Laura. The stories,\noriginally, were so short, that some friends, aware of their popularity,\nand conscious of their harmless tendency, took the trouble of copying\nthem in manuscript for their own young friends; but the tales have since\ngrown and expanded during frequent verbal repetitions, till, with\nvarious fanciful additions and new characters, they have enlarged into\ntheir present form, or rather so far beyond it, that several chapters\nare omitted, to keep the volume within moderate compass.\n\nPaley remarks, that \"any amusement which is innocent, is better than\nnone; as the writing of a book, the building of a house, the laying out\nof a garden, the digging of a fish-pond, even the raising of a\ncucumber;\" and it is hoped that, while the author herself has found much\ninteresting occupation in recording these often repeated stories, the\ntime of herself and her young readers may be employed with some degree\nof profit, or she will certainly regret that it was not better occupied\nin the rearing of cucumbers.\n\nCHAPTER I. CHIT CHAT.\n\n  A school-boy, a dog, and a walnut tree,\n  The more you strike 'em, the better they be.\n\n\nLaura and Harry Graham could scarcely feel sure that they ever had a\nmama, because she died while they were yet very young indeed; but Frank,\nwho was some years older, recollected perfectly well what pretty\nplaythings she used to give him, and missed his kind, good mama so\nextremely, that he one day asked if he might \"go to a shop and buy a new\nmama?\" Frank often afterwards thought of the time also, when he kneeled\nbeside her bed to say his prayers, or when he sat upon her knee to hear\nfunny stories about good boys and bad boys--all very interesting, and\nall told on purpose to show how much happier obedient children are, than\nthose who waste their time in idleness and folly. Boys and girls all\nthink they know the road to happiness without any mistake, and choose\nthat which looks gayest and pleasantest at first, though older people,\nwho have travelled that road already, can tell them that a very\ndifficult path is the only one which ends agreeably; and those who\nbegin to walk in it when they are young, will really find that \"wisdom's\nways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" It was\ntruly remarked by Solomon, that \"even a child is known by his doings,\nwhether his work be pure, and whether it be right.\" Therefore, though\nFrank was yet but a little boy, his friends, who observed how carefully\nhe attended to his mama's instructions, how frequently he studied his\nBible, and how diligently he learned his lessons, all prophesied that\nthis merry, lively child, with laughing eyes, and dimpled cheeks, would\nyet grow up to be a good and useful man; especially when it became\nevident that, by the blessing of God, he had been early turned away from\nthe broad road that leadeth to destruction, in which every living person\nwould naturally walk, and led into the narrow path that leadeth to\neternal life.\n\nWhen his mama, Lady Graham, after a long and painful illness, was at\nlast taken away to the better world, for which she had been many years\npreparing, her only sorrow and anxiety seemed to be that she left behind\nher three such very dear children, who were now to be entirely under the\ncare of their papa, Sir Edward Graham; and it was with many prayers and\ntears that she tried to make her mind more easy about their future\neducation, and future happiness.\n\nSir Edward felt such extreme grief on the death of Lady Graham, that\ninstead of being able to remain at home with his young family, and to\ninterest his mind as he would wish to have done, by attending to them,\nhe was ordered by Dr. Bell, to set off immediately for Paris, Rome, and\nNaples, where it was hoped he might leave his distresses behind him\nwhile he travelled, or at all events, forget them.\n\nLuckily the children had a very good, kind uncle, Major David Graham,\nand their grandmama, Lady Harriet Graham, who were both exceedingly\nhappy to take charge of them, observing that no house could be cheerful\nwithout a few little people being there, and that now they would have\nconstant amusement in trying to make Frank, Harry, and Laura, as happy\nas possible, and even still happier.\n\n\"That is the thing I am almost afraid of!\" said Sir Edward, smiling.\n\"Uncles and grandmamas are only too kind, and my small family will be\nquite spoiled by indulgence.\"\n\n\"Not if you leave that old vixen, Mrs. Crabtree, as governor of the\nnursery,\" answered Major Graham, laughing. \"She ought to have been the\ndrummer of a regiment, she is so fond of the rod! I believe there never\nwas such a tyrant since the time when nursery-maids were invented. Poor\nHarry would pass his life in a dark closet, like Baron Trenck, if Mrs.\nCrabtree had her own way!\"\n\n\"She means it all well. I am certain that Mrs. Crabtree is devotedly\nfond of my children, and would go through fire and water to serve them;\nbut she is a little severe perhaps. Her idea is, that if you never\nforgive a first fault, you will never hear of a second, which is\nprobably true enough. At all events, her harshness will be the best\nremedy for your extreme indulgence; therefore let me beg that you and my\nmother will seldom interfere with her 'method,' especially in respect to\nHarry and Laura. As for Frank, if all boys were like him, we might make\na bonfire of birch rods and canes. He is too old for nursery discipline\nnow, and must be flogged at school, if deserving of it at all, till he\ngoes to sea next year with my friend Gordon, who has promised to rate\nhim as a volunteer of the first class, on board the Thunderbolt.\"\n\nIn spite of Mrs. Crabtree's admirable \"system\" with children, Harry and\nLaura became, from this time, two of the most heedless, frolicsome\nbeings in the world, and had to be whipped almost every morning; for in\nthose days it had not been discovered that whipping is all a mistake,\nand that children can be made good without it; though some\nold-fashioned people still say--and such, too, who take the God of truth\nfor their guide--the old plan succeeded best, and those who \"spare the\nrod will spoil the child.\" When Lady Harriet and Major Graham spoke\nkindly to Harry and Laura, about anything wrong that had been done, they\nboth felt more sad and sorry, than after the severest punishments of\nMrs. Crabtree, who frequently observed, that \"if those children were\nshut up in a dark room alone, with nothing to do, they would still find\nsome way of being mischievous, and of deserving to be punished.\"\n\n\"Harry!\" said Major Graham one day, \"you remind me of a monkey which\nbelonged to the colonel of our regiment formerly. He was famous for\ncontriving to play all sorts of pranks when no one supposed them to be\npossible, and I recollect once having a valuable French clock, which the\nmalicious creature seemed particularly determined to break. Many a time\nI caught him in the fact, and saved my beautiful clock; but one day,\nbeing suddenly summoned out of the room, I hastily fastened his chain to\na table, so that he could not possibly, even at the full extent of his\npaw, so much as touch the glass case. I observed him impatiently\nwatching my departure, and felt a misgiving that he expected to get the\nbetter of me; so after shutting the door, I took a peep through the\nkey-hole, and what do you think Jack had done, Harry? for, next to Mr.\nMonkey himself, you are certainly the cleverest contriver of mischief I\nknow.\"\n\n\"What did he do?\" asked Harry eagerly; \"did he throw a stone at the\nclock?\"\n\n\"No! but his leg was several inches longer than his arm, so having\nturned his tail towards his object, he stretched out his hind-paw, and\nbefore I could rush back, my splendid alabaster clock had been upset and\nbroken to shivers.\"\n\nLaura soon became quite as mischievous as Harry, which is very\nsurprising, as she was a whole year older, and had been twice as often\nscolded by Mrs. Crabtree. Neither of these children intended any harm,\nfor they were only heedless lively romps, who would not for twenty\nworlds have told a lie, or done a shabby thing, or taken what did not\nbelong to them. They were not greedy either, and would not on any\naccount have resembled Peter Grey, who was at the same school with\nFrank, and who spent all his own pocket-money, and borrowed a great deal\nof other people's, to squander at the pastry-cook's, saying, he wished\nit were possible to eat three dinners, and two breakfasts, and five\nsuppers every day.\n\nHarry was not a cruel boy either; he never lashed his pony, beat his\ndog, pinched his sister, or killed any butterflies, though he often\nchased them for fun, and one day he even defended a wasp, at the risk of\nbeing stung, when Mrs. Crabtree intended to kill it.\n\n\"Nasty, useless vermin!\" said she angrily, \"What business have they in\nthe world! coming into other people's houses, with nothing to do! They\nsting and torment every body! Bees are very different, for they make\nhoney.\"\n\n\"And wasps make jelly!\" said Harry resolutely, while he opened the\nwindow, and shook the happy wasp out of his pocket handkerchief.\n\nMrs. Crabtree allowed no pets of any description in her territories, and\nordered the children to be happy without any such nonsense. When Laura's\ncanary-bird escaped one unlucky day out of its cage, Mrs. Crabtree was\nstrongly suspected by Major Graham, of having secretly opened the door,\nas she had long declared war upon bulfinches, white mice, parrots,\nkittens, dogs, bantams, and gold fish, observing that animals only made\na noise and soiled the house, therefore every creature should remain in\nits own home, \"birds in the air, fish in the sea, and beasts in the\ndesert.\" She seemed always watching in hopes Harry and Laura might do\nsomething that they ought to be punished for; and Mrs. Crabtree\ncertainly had more ears than other people, or slept with one eye open,\nas, whatever might be done, night or day, she overheard the lowest\nwhisper of mischief, and appeared able to see what was going on in the\ndark.\n\nWhen Harry was a very little boy, he sometimes put himself in the\ncorner, after doing wrong, apparently quite sensible that he deserved to\nbe punished, and once, after being terribly scolded by Mrs. Crabtree, he\ndrew in his stool beside her chair, with a funny penitent face, twirling\nhis thumbs over and over each other, and saying, \"Now, Mrs. Crabtree!\nlook what a good boy I am going to be!\"\n\n\"You a good boy!\" replied she contemptuously: \"No! no! the world will be\nturned into a cream-cheese first!\"\n\nLady Harriet gave Harry and Laura a closet of their own, in which she\nallowed them to keep their toys, and nobody could help laughing to see\nthat, amidst the whole collection, there was seldom one unbroken. Frank\nwrote out a list once of what he found in this crowded little\nstore-room, and amused himself often with reading it over afterwards.\nThere were three dolls without faces, a horse with no legs, a drum with\na hole in the top, a cart without wheels, a churn with no bottom, a kite\nwithout a tale, a skipping-rope with no handles, and a cup and ball that\nhad lost the string. Lady Harriet called this closet the hospital for\ndecayed toys, and she often employed herself as their doctor, mending\nlegs and arms for soldiers, horses, and dolls, though her skill seldom\nsucceeded long, because play-things must have been made of cast-iron to\nlast a week with Harry. One cold winter morning when Laura entered the\nnursery, she found a large fire blazing, and all her wax dolls sitting\nin a row within the fender staring at the flames. Harry intended no\nmischief on this occasion, but great was his vexation when Laura burst\ninto tears, and showed him that their faces were running in a hot stream\ndown upon their beautiful silk frocks, which were completely ruined, and\nnot a doll had its nose remaining. Another time, Harry pricked a hole in\nhis own beautiful large gas ball, wishing to see how the gas could\npossibly escape, after which, in a moment, it shrivelled up into a\nuseless empty bladder,--and when his kite was flying up to the clouds,\nHarry often wished that he could be tied to the tail himself, so as to\nfly also through the air like a bird, and see every thing.\n\nMrs. Crabtree always wore a prodigious bunch of jingling keys in her\npocket, that rung whenever she moved, as if she carried a dinner bell in\nher pocket, and Frank said it was like a rattlesnake giving warning of\nher approach, which was of great use, as everybody had time to put on a\nlook of good behaviour before she arrived. Even Betty, the under\nnursery-maid, felt in terror of Mrs. Crabtree's entrance, and was\nobliged to work harder than any six house-maids united. Frank told her\none day that he thought brooms might soon be invented, which would go by\nsteam and brush carpets of themselves, but, in the meantime, not a grain\nof dust could lurk in any corner of the nursery without being dislodged.\nBetty would have required ten hands, and twenty pair of feet, to do all\nthe work that was expected; but the grate looked like jet, the windows\nwould not have soiled a cambric handkerchief, and the carpet was\nswitched with so many tea-leaves, that Frank thought Mrs. Crabtree often\ntook several additional cups of tea in order to leave a plentiful supply\nof leaves for sweeping the floor next morning.\n\nIf Laura and Harry left any breakfast, Mrs. Crabtree kept it carefully\ntill dinner time, when they were obliged to finish the whole before\ntasting meat; and if they refused it at dinner, the remains were kept\nfor supper. Mrs. Crabtree always informed them that she did it \"for\ntheir good,\" though Harry never could see any good that it did to\neither of them; and when she mentioned how many poor children would be\nglad to eat what they despised, he often wished the hungry beggars had\nsome of his own hot dinner, which he would gladly have spared to them;\nfor Harry was really so generous, that he would have lived upon air, if\nhe might be of use to anybody. Time passed on, and Lady Harriet engaged\na master for some hours a-day to teach the children lessons, while even\nMrs. Crabtree found no other fault to Harry and Laura, except that in\nrespect to good behaviour their memories were like a sieve, which let\nout every thing they were desired to keep in mind. They seemed always to\nhope, somehow or other, when Mrs. Crabtree once turned her back, she\nwould never shew her face again; so their promises of better conduct\nwere all \"wind without rain,\"--very loud and plenty of them, but no good\neffect to be seen afterwards.\n\nAmong her many other torments, Mrs. Crabtree rolled up Laura's hair\nevery night on all sides of her head, in large stiff curl-papers, till\nthey were as round and hard as walnuts, after which, she tied on a\nnight-cap, as tightly as possible above all, saying this would curl the\nhair still better. Laura could not lay any part of her head on the\npillow, without suffering so much pain that, night after night, she sat\nup in bed, after Mrs. Crabtree had bustled out of the room, and quietly\ntook the cruel papers out, though she was punished so severely for doing\nso, that she obeyed orders at last and lay wide awake half the night\nwith torture; and it was but small comfort to Laura afterwards, that\nLady Harriet's visitors frequently admired the forest of long glossy\nringlets that adorned her head, and complimented Mrs. Crabtree on the\ntrouble it must cost her to keep that charming hair in order. Often did\nLaura wish that it were ornamenting any wig-block, rather than her own\nhead; and one day Lady Harriet laughed heartily, when some strangers\nadmired her little grand-daughter's ringlets, and Laura asked, very\nanxiously, if they would like to cut off a few of the longest, and keep\nthem for her sake.\n\n\"Your hair does curl like a cork-screw,\" said Frank, laughing. \"If I\nwant to draw a cork out of a beer bottle any day, I shall borrow one of\nthose ringlets, Laura!\"\n\n\"You may laugh, Frank, for it is fun to you and death to me,\" answered\npoor Laura, gravely shaking her curls at him. \"I wish we were all bald,\nlike uncle David! During the night, I cannot lie still on account of\nthose tiresome curls, and all day I dare not stir for fear of spoiling\nthem, so they are never out of my head.\"\n\n\"Nor off your head! How pleasant it must be to have Mrs. Crabtree\ncombing and scolding, and scolding and combing, for hours every day!\nPoor Laura! we must get Dr. Bell to say that they shall be taken off on\npain of death, and then, perhaps, grandmama would order some Irish\nreapers to cut them down with a sickle.\"\n\n\"Frank! what a lucky boy you are to be at school, and not in the\nnursery! I wish next year would come immediately, for then I shall have\na governess, after which good-bye to Mrs. Crabtree, and the wearisome\ncurl-papers.\"\n\n\"I don't like school!\" said Harry. \"It is perfect nonsense to plague me\nwith lessons now. All big people can read and write, so, of course, I\nshall be able to do like others. There is no hurry about it!\"\n\nNever was there a more amiable, pious, excellent boy than Frank, who\nread his Bible so attentively, and said his prayers so regularly every\nmorning and evening, that he soon learned both to know his duty and to\ndo it. Though he laughed heartily at the scrapes which Harry and Laura\nso constantly fell into, he often also helped them out of their\ndifficulties; being very different from most elderly boys, who find an\nodd kind of pleasure in teazing younger children--pulling their\nhair--pinching their arms--twitching away their dinners--and twenty\nmore plans for tormenting, which Frank never attempted to enjoy, but he\noften gave Harry and Laura a great deal of kind, sober, good advice,\nwhich they listened to very attentively while they were in any new\ndistress, but generally forgot again as soon as their spirits rose.\nFrank came home only upon Saturdays and Sundays, because he attended\nduring most of the week at Mr. Lexicon's academy, where he gradually\nbecame so clever, that the masters all praised his extraordinary\nattention, and covered him with medals, while Major Graham often filled\nhis pockets with a reward of money, after which he ran towards the\nnearest shop to spend his little fortune in buying a present for\nsomebody. Frank scarcely ever wanted anything for himself, but he always\nwished to contrive some kind generous plan for other people; and Major\nGraham used to say, \"if that boy had only sixpence in the world, he\nwould lay it all out on penny tarts to distribute among half-a-dozen of\nhis friends.\" He even saved his pocket-money once, during three whole\nmonths, to purchase a gown for Mrs. Crabtree, who looked almost\ngood-humoured during the space of five minutes, when Frank presented it\nto her, saying, in his joyous merry voice, \"Mrs. Crabtree! I wish you\nhealth to wear it, strength to tear it, and money to buy another!\"\n\nCertainly there never was such a gown before! It had been chosen by\nFrank and Harry together, who thought nothing could be more perfect. The\ncolour was so bright an apple-green, that it would have put any body's\nteeth on edge to look at it, and the whole was dotted over with large\nround spots of every colour, as if a box of wafers had been showered\nupon the surface. Laura wished Mrs. Crabtree might receive a present\nevery day, as it put her in such good-humour, and nearly three weeks\nafter passed this, without a single scold being heard in the nursery;\nso Frank observed that he thought Mrs. Crabtree would soon be quite out\nof practice.\n\n\"Laura!\" said Major Graham, looking very sly one morning, \"have you\nheard all the new rules that Mrs. Crabtree has made?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied she in great alarm; \"what are they?\"\n\n\"In the first place, you are positively not to tear and destroy above\nthree frocks a-day; secondly, you and Harry must never get into a\npassion, unless you are angry; thirdly, when either of you take\nmedicine, you are not to make wry faces, except when the taste is bad;\nfourthly, you must never speak ill of Mrs. Crabtree herself, until she\nis out of the room; fifthly, you are not to jump out of the windows, as\nlong as you can get out at the door\"----\n\n\"Yes!\" interrupted Laura, laughing, \"and sixthly, when uncle David is\njoking, we are not to be frightened by anything he says!\"\n\n\"Seventhly, when next you spill grandmama's bottle of ink, Harry must\ndrink up every drop.\"\n\n\"Very well! he may swallow a sheet of blotting paper afterwards, to put\naway the taste.\"\n\n\"I wish every body who writes a book, was obliged to swallow it,\" said\nHarry. \"It is such a waste of time reading, when we might be amusing\nourselves. Frank sat mooning over a book for two hours yesterday when we\nwanted him to play. I am sure, some day his head will burst with\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"That can never happen to you, Master Harry,\" answered Major Graham;\n\"you have a head, and so has a pin, but there is not much furniture in\neither of them.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE GRAND FEAST.\n\n  She gave them some tea without any bread,\n  She whipp'd them all soundly, and sent them to bed.\n\n                                         Nursery Rhymes.\n\n\nLady Harriet Graham was an extremely thin, delicate, old lady, with a\nvery pale face, and a sweet gentle voice, which the children delighted\nto hear, for it always spoke kindly to them, and sounded like music,\nafter the loud, rough tones of Mrs. Crabtree. She wore her own grey\nhair, which had become almost as white as the widow's cap which covered\nher head. The rest of her dress was generally black velvet, and she\nusually sat in a comfortable arm-chair by the fire-side, watching her\ngrandchildren at play, with a large work-bag by her side, and a\nprodigious Bible open on the table before her. Lady Harriet often said\nthat it made her young again to see the joyous gambols of Harry and\nLaura; and when unable any longer to bear their noise, she sometimes\nkept them quiet, by telling the most delightful stories about what had\nhappened to herself when she was young.\n\nOnce upon a time, however, Lady Harriet suddenly became so very ill,\nthat Dr. Bell said she must spend a few days in the country, for change\nof air, and accordingly she determined on passing a quiet week at\nHoliday House with her relations, Lord and Lady Rockville. Meanwhile,\nHarry and Laura were to be left under the sole care of Mrs. Crabtree, so\nit might have been expected that they would both feel more frightened\nfor her, now that she was reigning monarch of the house, than ever.\nHarry would obey those he loved, if they only held up a little finger;\nbut all the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree, and her cat-o'-nine-tails, were\ngenerally forgotten soon after she left the room; therefore he thought\nlittle at first about the many threats she held out, if he behaved ill,\nbut he listened most seriously when his dear sick grandmama told him, in\na faint weak voice, on the day of her departure from home, how very well\nhe ought to behave in her absence, as no one remained but the maids to\nkeep him in order, and that she hoped Mrs. Crabtree would write her a\nletter full of good news about his excellent conduct.\n\nHarry felt as if he would gladly sit still without stirring, till his\ngrandmama came back, if that could only please her; and there never was\nany one more determined to be a good boy than he, at the moment when\nLady Harriet's carriage came round to the door. Laura, Frank, and Harry\nhelped to carry all the pillows, boxes, books, and baskets which were\nnecessary for the journey, of which there seemed to be about fifty; then\nthey arranged the cushions as comfortably as possible, and watched very\nsorrowfully when their grandmama, after kindly embracing them both, was\ncarefully supported by Major Graham and her maid Harrison, into the\nchariot. Uncle David gave each of the children a pretty picture-book\nbefore taking leave, and said, as he was stepping into the carriage,\n\"Now, children! I have only one piece of serious, important advice to\ngive you all, so attend to me!--never crack nuts with your teeth!\"\n\nWhen the carriage had driven off, Mrs. Crabtree became so busy scolding\nBetty, and storming at Jack the foot-boy, for not cleaning her shoes\nwell enough, that she left Harry and Laura standing in the passage, not\nknowing exactly what they ought to do first, and Frank, seeing them\nlooking rather melancholy and bewildered at the loss of their grandmama,\nstopped a moment as he passed on the way to school, and said in a very\nkind, affectionate voice,\n\n\"Now, Harry and Laura, listen both of you!--here is a grand opportunity\nto show everybody, that we can be trusted to ourselves, without getting\ninto any scrapes, so that if grandmama is ever ill again, and obliged to\ngo away, she need not feel so sad and anxious as she did to-day. I mean\nto become nine times more attentive to my lessons than usual this\nmorning, to show how trust-worthy we are, and if you are wise, pray\nmarch straight up to the nursery yourselves. I have arranged a gown and\ncap of Mrs. Crabtree's on the large arm-chair, to look as like herself\nas possible, that you may be reminded how soon she will come back, and\nyou must not behave like the mice when the cat is out. Good bye! Say the\nalphabet backward, and count your fingers for half-an-hour, but when\nMrs. Crabtree appears again, pray do not jump out of the window for\njoy.\"\n\nHarry and Laura were proceeding directly towards the nursery, as Frank\nhad recommended, when unluckily they observed in passing the\ndrawing-room door, that it was wide open; so Harry peeped in, and they\nbegan idly wandering round the tables and cabinets. Not ten minutes\nelapsed before they both commenced racing about as if they were mad,\nperfectly screaming with joy, and laughing so loudly at their own funny\ntricks, that an old gentleman who lived next door, very nearly sent in a\nmessage to ask what the joke was.\n\nPresently Harry and Laura ran up and down stairs till the housemaid was\nquite fatigued with running after them. They jumped upon the fine damask\nsofas in the drawing-room, stirred the fire till it was in a blaze, and\nrushed out on the balcony, upsetting one or two geraniums and a myrtle.\nThey spilt Lady Harriet's perfumes over their handkerchiefs,--they\nlooked into all the beautiful books of pictures,--they tumbled many of\nthe pretty Dresden china figures on the floor,--they wound up the little\nFrench clock till it was broken,--they made the musical work-box play\nits tunes, and set the Chinese mandarins nodding, till they very nearly\nnodded their heads off. In short, so much mischief has seldom been done\nin so short a time, till at last Harry, perfectly worn out with laughing\nand running, threw himself into a large arm-chair, and Laura, with her\nringlets tumbling in frightful confusion over her face, and the beads of\nher coral necklace rolling on the floor, tossed herself into a sofa\nbeside him.\n\n\"Oh! what fun!\" cried Harry, in an ecstacy of delight; \"I wish Frank had\nbeen here, and crowds of little boys and girls, to play with us all day!\nIt would be a good joke, Laura, to write and ask all our little cousins\nand companions to drink tea here to-morrow evening! Their mamas could\nnever guess we had not leave from grandmama to invite everybody, so I\ndare say we might gather quite a large party! oh! how enchanting!\"\n\nLaura laughed heartily when she heard this proposal of Harry's, and\nwithout hesitating a moment about it, she joyously placed herself before\nLady Harriet's writing-table, and scribbled a multitude of little notes,\nin large text, to more than twenty young friends, all of whom had at\nother times been asked by Lady Harriet to spend the evening with her.\n\nLaura felt very much puzzled to know what was usually said in a card of\ninvitation, but after many consultations, she and Harry thought at last,\nthat it was very nicely expressed, for they wrote these words upon a\nlarge sheet of paper to each of their friends:--\n\nMaster Harry Graham and Miss Laura wish you to have the honour of\ndrinking tea with us to-morrow, at six o'clock.\n\n    (Signed) Harry and Laura.\n\nLaura afterwards singed a hole in her muslin frock, while\nlighting one of the Vesta matches to seal these numerous notes; and\nHarry dropped some burning sealing-wax on his hand, in the hurry of\nassisting her; but he thought that little accident no matter, and ran\naway to see if the cards could be sent off immediately.\n\nNow, there lived in the house a very old footman, called Andrew, who\nremembered Harry and Laura since they were quite little babies; and he\noften looked exceedingly sad and sorry when they suffered punishment\nfrom Mrs. Crabtree. He was ready to do anything in the world when it\npleased the children, and would have carried a message to the moon, if\nthey had only shown him the way. Many odd jobs and private messages he\nhad already been employed in by Harry, who now called Andrew up stairs,\nentreating him to carry out all those absurd notes as fast as possible,\nand to deliver them immediately, as they were of the greatest\nconsequence. Upon hearing this, old Andrew lost not a moment, but threw\non his hat, and instantly started off, looking like the twopenny\npostman, he carried such a prodigious parcel of invitations, while Harry\nand Laura stood at the drawing-room window, almost screaming with joy\nwhen they saw him set out, and when they observed that, to oblige them,\nhe actually ran along the street at a sort of trot, which was as fast as\nhe could possibly go. Presently, however, he certainly did stop for a\nsingle minute, and Laura saw that it was in order to take a peep into\none of the notes, that he might ascertain what they were all about; but\nas he never carried any letters without doing so, she thought that quite\nnatural, and was only very glad when he had finished, and rapidly\npursued his way again.\n\nNext morning, Mrs. Crabtree and Betty became very much surprised to\nobserve what a number of smart livery servants knocked at the street\ndoor, and gave in cards, but their astonishment became still greater,\nwhen old Andrew brought up a whole parcel of them to Harry and Laura,\nwho immediately broke the seals, and read the contents in a corner\ntogether.\n\n\"What are you about there, Master Graham?\" cried Mrs. Crabtree, angrily,\n\"how dare any body venture to touch your grandmama's letters?\"\n\n\"They are not for grandmama!--they are all for us!--every one of them!\"\nanswered Harry, dancing about the room with joy, and waving the notes\nover his head. \"Look at this direction! For Master and Miss Graham! put\non your spectacles, and read it yourself, Mrs. Crabtree! What delightful\nfun! the house will be as full as an egg!\"\n\nMrs. Crabtree seemed completely puzzled what to think of all this, and\nlooked so much as if she did not know exactly what to be angry at, and\nso ready to be in a passion if possible, that Harry burst out a\nlaughing, while he said, \"Only think Mrs. Crabtree! here is every body\ncoming to tea with us!--all my cousins, besides Peter Grey, Robert\nStewart, Charles Forrester, Adelaide Cunninghame, Diana Wentworth, John\nFordyce, Edmund Ashford, Frank Abercromby, Ned Russel, and Tom ----\"\n\n\"The boy is distracted!\" exclaimed Betty, staring with astonishment.\n\"What does all this mean, Master Harry?\"\n\n\"And who gave you leave to invite company into your grandmama's house?\"\ncried Mrs. Crabtree, snatching up all the notes, and angrily thrusting\nthem into the fire. \"I never heard of such things in all my life before,\nMaster Harry! but as sure as eggs is eggs, you shall repent of this, for\nnot one morsel of cake, or anything else shall you have to give any of\nthe party; no! not so much as a crust of bread, or a thimbleful of tea!\"\n\nHarry and Laura had never thought of such a catastrophe as this before;\nthey always saw a great table covered with every thing that could be\nnamed for tea, whenever their little friends came to visit them, and\nwhether it rose out of the floor, or was brought by Aladdin's lamp, they\nnever considered it possible that the table would not be provided as\nusual on such occasions, so this terrible speech of Mrs. Crabtree's\nfrightened them out of their wits. What was to be done! They both knew\nby experience that she always did whatever she threatened, or something\na great deal worse, so they began by bursting into tears, and begging\nMrs. Crabtree for this once to excuse them, and to give some cakes and\ntea to their little visitors, but they might as well have spoken to one\nof the Chinese mandarins, for she only shook her head, with a positive\nlook, declaring over and over again that nothing should appear upon the\ntable except what was always brought up for their own supper--two\nbiscuits and two cups of milk.\n\n\"Therefore say no more about it!\" added she, sternly. \"I am your best\nfriend, Master Harry, trying to teach you and Miss Laura your duty, so\nsave your breath to cool your porridge.\"\n\nPoor Harry and Laura looked perfectly ill with fright and vexation when\nthey thought of what was to happen next, while Mrs. Crabtree sat down to\nher knitting, grumbling to herself, and dropping her stitches every\nminute with rage and irritation. Old Andrew felt exceedingly sorry after\nhe heard what distress and difficulty Harry was in, and when the hour\nfor the party approached, he very good-naturedly spread out a large\ntable in the dining-room, where he put down as many cups, saucers,\nplates, and spoons as Laura chose to direct; but in spite of all his\ntrouble, though it looked very grand, there was nothing whatever to eat\nor drink, except the two dry biscuits, and the two miserable cups of\nmilk, which seemed to become smaller every time that Harry looked at\nthem.\n\nPresently the clock struck six, and Harry listened to the hour very much\nas a prisoner would do in the condemned cell in Newgate, feeling that\nthe dreaded time was at last arrived. Soon afterwards, several handsome\ncarriages drove up to the door filled with little Masters and Misses,\nwho hurried joyfully into the house, talking and laughing all the way up\nstairs, being evidently quite happy at coming out to tea, while poor\nHarry and Laura almost wished the floor would open and swallow them up,\nso they shrunk into a distant corner of the room, quite ashamed to show\ntheir faces.\n\nThe young ladies were all dressed in their best frocks, with pink\nsashes, and pink shoes; while the little boys appeared in their holiday\nclothes, with their hair newly brushed, and their faces washed. The\nwhole party had dined at two o'clock, so they were as hungry as hawks,\nlooking eagerly round, whenever they entered, to see what was on the\ntea-table, and evidently surprised that nothing had yet been put down.\nLaura and Harry soon afterwards heard their visitors whispering to each\nother about Norwich buns, rice cakes, spunge biscuits, and maccaroons;\nwhile Peter Grey was loud in praise of a party at George Lorraine's the\nnight before, where an immense plum-cake had been sugared over like a\nsnow storm, and covered with crowds of beautiful amusing mottoes; not to\nmention a quantity of noisy crackers, that exploded like pistols;\nbesides which, a glass of hot jelly had been handed to each little guest\nbefore he was sent home.\n\nEvery time the door opened, all eyes were anxiously turned round,\nexpecting a grand feast to be brought in; but quite the contrary--it was\nonly Andrew showing up more hungry visitors; while Harry felt so\nunspeakably wretched, that, if some kind fairy could only have turned\nhim into a Norwich bun at the moment, he would gladly have consented to\nbe cut in pieces, that his ravenous guests might be satisfied.\n\nCharles Forrester was a particularly good-natured boy, so Harry at last\ntook courage and beckoned him into a remote corner of the room, where he\nconfessed, in whispers, the real state of affairs about tea, and how\nsadly distressed he and Laura felt, because they had nothing whatever to\ngive among so many visitors, seeing that Mrs. Crabtree kept her\ndetermination of affording them no provisions.\n\n\"What is to be done!\" said Charles, very anxiously, as he felt extremely\nsorry for his little friends. \"If Mama had been at home, she would\ngladly have sent whatever you liked for tea, but unluckily she is dining\nout! I saw a loaf of bread lying on a table at home this evening, which\nshe would make you quite welcome to! Shall I run home, as fast as\npossible, to fetch it? That would, at any rate, be better than nothing!\"\n\nPoor Charles Forrester was very lame, therefore, while he talked of\nrunning he could hardly walk, but Lady Forrester's house stood so near,\nthat he soon reached home, when, snatching up the loaf, he hurried back\ntowards the street with his prize, quite delighted to see how large and\nsubstantial it looked. Scarcely had he reached the door, however, before\nthe housekeeper ran hastily out, saying,\n\n\"Stop, Mr. Charles! stop! sure you are not running away with the loaf\nfor my tea, and the parrot must have her supper too. What do you want\nwith that there bread?\"\n\n\"Never mind, Mrs. Comfit!\" answered Charles, hastening on faster than\never, while he grasped the precious loaf more firmly in his hand, and\nlimped along at a prodigious rate, \"Polly is getting too fat, so she\nwill be the better of fasting for this one day.\"\n\nMrs. Comfit, being enormously fat herself, became very angry at this\nremark, so she seemed quite desperate to recover the loaf, and hurried\nforward to overtake Charles, but the old housekeeper was so heavy and\nbreathless, while the young gentleman was so lame, that it seemed an\neven chance which won the race. Harry stood at his own door, impatiently\nhoping to receive the prize, and eagerly stretched out his arms to\nencourage his friend, while it was impossible to say which of the\nrunners might arrive first. Harry had sometimes heard of a race between\ntwo old women tied up in sacks, and he thought they could scarcely move\nwith more difficulty; but at the very moment when Charles had reached\nthe door, he stumbled over a stone, and fell on the ground. Mrs. Comfit\nthen instantly rushed up, and seizing the loaf, she carried it off in\ntriumph, leaving the two little friends ready to cry with vexation, and\nquite at a loss what plan to attempt next.\n\nMean time, a sad riot had arisen in the dining-room, where the boys\ncalled loudly for their tea; and the young ladies drew their chairs all\nround the table, to wait till it was ready. Still nothing appeared; so\nevery body wondered more and more how long they were to wait for all the\nnice cakes and sweetmeats which must, of course, be coming; for the\nlonger they were delayed, the more was expected.\n\nThe last at a feast, and the first at a fray, was generally Peter Grey,\nwho now lost patience, and seized one of the two biscuits, which he was\nin the middle of greedily devouring, when Laura returned with Harry to\nthe dining-room, and observed what he had done.\n\n\"Peter Grey!\" said she, holding up her head, and trying to look very\ndignified, \"you are an exceedingly naughty boy, to help yourself! As a\npunishment for being so rude, you shall have nothing more to eat all\nthis evening.\"\n\n\"If I do not help myself, nobody else seems likely to give me any\nsupper! I appear to be the only person who is to taste anything\nto-night,\" answered Peter, laughing, while the impudent boy took a cup\nof milk, and drank it off, saying, \"Here's to your very good health,\nMiss Laura, and an excellent appetite to everybody!\"\n\nUpon hearing this absurd speech, all the other boys began laughing, and\nmade signs, as if they were eating their fingers off with hunger. Then\nPeter called Lady Harriet's house \"Famine Castle,\" and pretended he\nwould swallow the knives like an Indian juggler.\n\n\"We must learn to live upon air, and here are some spoons to eat it\nwith,\" said John Fordyce. \"Harry! shall I help you to a mouthful of\nmoonshine?\"\n\n\"Peter! would you like a roasted fly?\" asked Frank Abercromby, catching\none on the window. \"I dare say it is excellent for hungry people,--or a\nslice of buttered wall?\"\n\n\"Or a stewed spider?\" asked Peter. \"Shall we all be cannibals, and eat\none another?\"\n\n\"What is the use of all those forks, when there is nothing to stick upon\nthem?\" asked George Maxwell, throwing them about on the floor. \"No\nbuns!--no fruit!--no cakes!--no nothing!\"\n\n\"What are we to do with those tea-cups, when there is no tea?\" cried\nFrank Abercromby, pulling the table-cloth till the whole affair fell\nprostrate on the floor. After this, these riotous boys tossed the plates\nup in the air, and caught them, becoming, at last, so outrageous, that\npoor old Andrew called them a \"meal mob.\" Never was there so much broken\nchina seen in a dining-room before! It all lay scattered on the floor,\nin countless fragments, looking as if there had been a bull in a china\nshop, when suddenly Mrs. Crabtree herself opened the door and walked in,\nwith an aspect of rage enough to petrify a milestone. Now old Andrew had\nlong been trying all in his power to render the boys quiet and\ncontented. He had made them a speech,--he had chased the ring-leaders\nall round the room,--and he had thrown his stick at Peter, who seemed\nthe most riotous,--but all in vain; they became worse and worse,\nlaughing into fits, and calling Andrew \"the police-officer,\" and \"the\nbailiff.\" It was a very different story, however, when Mrs. Crabtree\nappeared, so flaming with fury, she might have blown up a powder-mill.\n\nNobody could help being afraid of her. Even Peter himself stood\nstock-still, and seemed withering away to nothing, when she looked at\nhim; and when she began to scold in her most furious manner, not a boy\nventured to look off the ground. A large pair of tawse then became\nvisible in her hand, so every heart sunk with fright, and the riotous\nvisitors began to get behind each other, and to huddle out of sight as\nmuch as possible, whispering and pushing, and fighting, in a desperate\nscuffle to escape.\n\n\"What is all this!\" cried she, at the full pitch of her voice, \"has\nbedlam broke loose! who smashed these cups? I'll break his head for him,\nlet me tell you that! Master Peter! you should be hissed out of the\nworld for your misconduct; but I shall certainly whip you round the room\nlike a whipping-top.\"\n\nAt this moment, Peter observed that the dining-room window, which was\nonly about six feet from the ground, had been left wide open, so\ninstantly seizing the opportunity, he threw himself out with a single\nbound, and ran laughing away. All the other boys immediately followed\nhis example, and disappeared by the same road; after which, Mrs.\nCrabtree leaned far out of the window, and scolded loudly, as long as\nthey remained in sight, till her face became red, and her voice\nperfectly hoarse.\n\nMeantime, the little misses sat soberly down before the empty table, and\ntalked in whispers to each other, waiting till their maids came to take\nthem home, after which they all hurried away as fast as possible, hardly\nwaiting to say \"good bye,\" and intending to ask for some supper at home.\n\nDuring that night, long after Harry and Laura had been scolded, whipped,\nand put to bed, they were each heard in different rooms, sobbing and\ncrying, as if their very hearts would break, while Mrs. Crabtree\ngrumbled and scolded to herself, saying she must do her duty, and make\nthem good children, though she were to flay them alive first.\n\nWhen Lady Harriet returned home some days afterwards, she heard an\naccount of Harry and Laura's misconduct from Mrs. Crabtree, and the\nwhole story was such a terrible case against them, that their poor\ngrandmama became perfectly astonished and shocked, while even uncle\nDavid was preparing to be very angry; but before the culprits appeared,\nFrank most kindly stepped forward, and begged that they might be\npardoned for this once, adding all in his power to excuse Harry and\nLaura, by describing how very penitent they had become, and how very\nseverely they had already been punished.\n\nFrank then mentioned all that Harry had told him about the starving\nparty, which he related with so much humour and drollery, that Lady\nHarriet could not help laughing; so then he saw that a victory had been\ngained, and ran to the nursery for the two little prisoners.\n\nUncle David shook his walking-stick at them, and made a terrible face,\nwhen they entered; but Harry jumped upon his knee with joy at seeing him\nagain, while Laura forgot all her distress, and rushed up to Lady\nHarriet, who folded her in her arms, and kissed her most affectionately.\n\nNot a word was said that day about the tea-party, but next morning,\nMajor Graham asked Harry, very gravely, \"if he had read in the\nnewspapers the melancholy accounts about several of his little\ncompanions, who were ill and confined to bed from having ate too much at\na certain tea-party on Saturday last. Poor Peter Grey has been given\nover, and Charles Forrester, it is feared, may not be able to eat\nanother loaf of bread for a fortnight!\"\n\n\"Oh! uncle David! it makes me ill whenever I think of that party!\" said\nHarry, colouring perfectly scarlet; \"that was the most miserable evening\nof my life!\"\n\n\"I must say it was not quite fair in Mrs. Crabtree to starve all the\nstrange little boys and girls, who came as visitors to my house, without\nknowing who had invited them,\" observed Lady Harriet. \"Probably those\nunlucky children will never forget, as long as they live, that scanty\nsupper in our dining-room.\"\n\nAnd it turned out exactly as Lady Harriet had predicted; for though they\nwere all asked to tea, in proper time, the very next Saturday, when\nMajor Graham showered torrents of sugar-plums on the table, while the\nchildren scrambled to pick them up, and the side-board almost broke down\nafterwards under the weight of buns, cakes, cheesecakes, biscuits,\nfruit, and preserves, which were heaped upon each other--yet, for years\nafterwards, Peter Grey, whenever he ate a particularly enormous dinner,\nalways observed, that he must make up for having once been starved at\nHarry Graham's; and whenever any one of those little boys or girls again\nhappened to meet Harry or Laura, they were sure to laugh and say, \"When\nare you going to give us another\n\n                              \"GRAND FEAST?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE TERRIBLE FIRE.\n\n  Fire rages with fury wherever it comes,\n  If only one spark should be dropped;\n  Whole houses, or cities, sometimes it consumes,\n  Where its violence cannot be stopped.\n\n\nOne night, about eight o'clock, Harry and Laura were playing in the\nnursery, building houses with bricks, and trying who could raise the\nhighest tower without letting it fall, when suddenly they were startled\nto hear every bell in the house ringing violently, while the servants\nseemed running up and down stairs, as if they were distracted.\n\n\"What can be the matter!\" cried Laura, turning round and listening,\nwhile Harry quietly took this opportunity to shake the walls of her\ncastle till it fell.\n\n\"The very house is coming down about your ears, Laura!\" said Harry,\nenjoying his little bit of mischief. \"I should like to be Andrew, now,\nfor five minutes, that I might answer those fifty bells, and see what\nhas happened. Uncle David must be wanting coals, candles, tea, toast,\nand soda water, all at once! What a bustle everybody is in! There! the\nbells are ringing again, worse than ever! Something wonderful is going\non! what can it be!\"\n\nPresently Betty ran breathlessly into the room, saying that Mrs.\nCrabtree ought to come down stairs immediately, as Lady Harriet had been\nsuddenly taken very ill, and, till the Doctor arrived, nobody knew what\nto do, so she must give her advice and assistance.\n\nHarry and Laura felt excessively shocked to hear this alarming news, and\nlistened with grave attention, while Mrs. Crabtree told them how\namazingly well they ought to behave in her absence, when they were\ntrusted alone in the nursery, with nobody to keep them in order, or to\nsee what they were doing, especially now, as their grandmama had been\ntaken ill, and would require to be kept quiet.\n\nHarry sat in his chair, and might have been painted as the very picture\nof a good boy during nearly twenty minutes after Mrs. Crabtree departed;\nand Laura placed herself opposite to him, trying to follow so excellent\nan example, while they scarcely spoke above a whisper, wondering what\ncould be the matter with their grandmama, and wishing for once, to see\nMrs. Crabtree again, that they might hear how she was. Any one who had\nobserved Harry and Laura at that time, would have wondered to see two\nsuch quiet, excellent, respectable children, and wished that all little\nboys and girls were made upon the same pattern; but presently they began\nto think that probably Lady Harriet was not so very ill, as no more\nbells had rung during several minutes, and Harry ventured to look about\nfor some better amusement than sitting still.\n\nAt this moment Laura unluckily perceived on the table near where they\nsat, a pair of Mrs. Crabtree's best scissors, which she had been\npositively forbid to touch. The long troublesome ringlets were as usual\nhanging over her eyes in a most teazing manner, so she thought what a\ngood opportunity this might be to shorten them a very little, not above\nan inch or two; and without considering a moment longer, she slipped\nupon tiptoe, with a frightened look, round the table, and picked up the\nscissors in her hand, then hastening towards a looking-glass, she began\nsnipping off the ends of her hair. Laura was much diverted to see it\nshowering down upon the floor, so she cut and cut on, while the curls\nfell thicker and faster, till at last the whole floor was covered with\nthem, and scarcely a hair left upon her head. Harry went into fits of\nlaughing when he perceived what a ridiculous figure Laura had made of\nherself, and he turned her round and round to see the havoc she had\nmade, saying,\n\n\"You should give all this hair to Mr. Mills the upholsterer, to stuff\ngrandmama's arm-chair with! At any rate, Laura, if Mrs. Crabtree is ever\nso angry, she can hardly pull you by the hair of the head again! What a\nsound sleep you will have to-night, with no hard curl-papers to torment\nyou!\"\n\nHarry had been told five hundred times, never to touch the candles, and\nthreatened with twenty different punishments, if he ever ventured to do\nso; but now, he amused himself with trying to snuff one till he snuffed\nit out. Then he lighted it again, and tried the experiment once more,\nbut again the teazing candle went out, as if on purpose to plague him,\nso he felt quite provoked. Having lighted it once more, Harry prepared\nto carry the candlestick with him towards the inner nursery, though\nafraid to make the smallest noise, in case it might be taken from him.\nBefore he had gone five steps, down dropped the extinguisher, then\nfollowed the snuffers with a great crash, but Laura seemed too busy\ncropping her ringlets, to notice what was going on. All the way along\nupon the floor, Harry let fall a perfect shower of hot wax, which\nspotted the nursery carpet from the table where he had found the candle\ninto the next room, where he disappeared, and shut the door, that no one\nmight interfere with what he liked to do.\n\nAfter he had been absent some time, the door was hastily opened again,\nand Laura felt surprised to see Harry come back with his face as red as\na stick of sealing-wax, and his large eyes staring wider than they had\never stared before, with a look of rueful consternation.\n\n\"What is the matter!\" exclaimed Laura in a terrified voice. \"Has\nanything dreadful happened? Why do you look so frightened and so\nsurprised?\"\n\n\"Oh dear! oh dear! what shall I do?\" cried Harry, who seemed scarcely to\nknow how he spoke, or where he was. \"I don't know what to do, Laura!\"\n\n\"What can be the matter! do tell me at once, Harry,\" said Laura, shaking\nwith apprehension. \"Speak as fast as you can!\"\n\n\"Will you not tell Mrs. Crabtree, nor grandmama, nor anybody else?\"\ncried Harry, bursting into tears. \"I am so very, very sorry, and so\nfrightened! Laura! do you know, I took a candle into the next room,\nmerely to play with it.\"\n\n\"Well! go on, Harry! go on! what did you do with the candle?\"\n\n\"I only put it on the bed for a single minute, to see how the flame\nwould look there,--well! do you know it blazed away famously, and then\nall the bed clothes began burning too! Oh! there is such a terrible fire\nin the next room! you never saw anything like it! what shall we do? If\nold Andrew were to come up, do you think he could put it out? I have\nshut the door that Mrs. Crabtree may not see the flames. Be sure, Laura,\nto tell nobody but Andrew.\"\n\nLaura became terrified at the way she saw poor Harry in, but when she\nopened the door to find out the real state of affairs, oh! what a\ndreadful sight was there! all the beds were on fire, while bright red\nflames were blazing up to the roof of the room, with a fierce roaring\nnoise, which it was perfectly frightful to hear. She screamed aloud with\nterror at this alarming scene, while Harry did all he could to quiet\nher, and even put his hand over her mouth, that her cries might not be\nheard. Laura now struggled to get loose, and called louder and louder,\ntill at last every maid in the house came racing up stairs, three steps\nat a time, to know what was the matter. Immediately upon seeing the\nflames, they all began screaming too, in such a loud discordant way,\nthat it sounded as if a whole flight of crows had come into the\npassages. Never was there such an uproar heard in the house before, for\nthe walls echoed with a general cry of \"Fire! fire! fire!\"\n\nUp flew Mrs. Crabtree towards the nursery like a sky-rocket, scolding\nfuriously, talking louder than all the others put together, and asking\nwho had set the house on fire, while Harry and Laura scarcely knew\nwhether to be most frightened for the raging flames, or the raging Mrs.\nCrabtree; but, in the meantime, they both shrunk into the smallest\npossible size, and hid themselves behind a door.\n\nDuring all this confusion, Old Andrew luckily remembered, that, in the\nmorning, there had been a great washing in the laundry, where large tubs\nfull of water were standing, so he called to the few maids who had any\nof their senses remaining, desiring them to assist in carrying up some\nbuckets, that they might be emptied on the burning beds, to extinguish\nthe flames if possible. Every body was now in a hurry, and all elbowing\neach other out of the way, while it was most extraordinary to see how\nold Andrew exerted himself, as if he had been a fireman all his life,\nwhile Mrs. Marmalade, the fat cook, who could hardly carry herself up\nstairs in general, actively assisted to bring up the great heavy tubs,\nand to pour them out like a cascade upon the burning curtains, till the\nnursery-floor looked like a duck pond.\n\nMeantime Harry and Laura added to the confusion as much as they could,\nand were busier than anybody, stealing down the back-stairs whenever\nMrs. Crabtree was not in sight, and filling their little jugs with\nwater, which they brought up, as fast as possible, and dashed upon the\nflames, till at last, it is to be feared, they began to feel quite\namused with the bustle, and to be almost sorry when the conflagration\ndiminished. At one time, Laura very nearly set her own frock on fire, as\nshe ventured too near, but Harry pulled her back, and then courageously\nadvanced to discharge a shower from his own little jug, remaining\nstationary to watch the effect, till his face was almost scorched.\n\nAt last the fire became less and less, till it went totally out, but not\nbefore the nursery furniture had been reduced to perfect ruins, besides\nwhich, Betty had her arm sadly burned in the confusion. Mrs. Marmalade's\ncap was completely destroyed, and Mrs. Crabtree's best gown had so large\na hole burned in the skirt, that she never could wear it again!\n\nAfter all was quiet, and the fire completely extinguished, Major Graham\ntook Laura down stairs to Lady Harriet's dressing-room, that she might\ntell the whole particulars of how this alarming accident happened in the\nnursery, for nobody could guess what had caused so sudden and dreadful a\nfire, which seemed to have been as unexpected as a flash of lightning.\n\nLady Harriet had felt so terrified by the noise and confusion, that she\nwas out of bed, sitting up in an arm-chair, supported by pillows, when\nLaura entered, at the sight of whom, with her well-cropped head, she\nmade an exclamation of perfect amazement.\n\n\"Why! who on earth is that! Laura! my dear child! what has become of all\nyour hair? Were your curls burned off in the fire? or did the fright\nmake you grow bald? What is the meaning of all this?\"\n\nLaura turned perfectly crimson with shame and distress, for she now felt\nconvinced of her own great misconduct about the scissors and curls, but\nshe had been taught on all occasions to speak the truth, and would\nrather have died than told a lie, or even allowed any person to believe\nwhat was not true, therefore she answered in a low, frightened voice,\nwhile the tears came into her eyes, \"My hair has not been burned off,\ngrandmama! but--but--\"\n\n\"Well, child! speak out!\" said Lady Harriet, impatiently, \"did some\nhair-dresser come to the house and rob you?\"\n\n\"Or are you like the ladies of Carthage who gave their long hair for\nbows and arrows?\" asked Major Graham. \"I never saw such a little fright\nin my life as you look now; but tell us all about it?\"\n\n\"I have been quite as naughty as Harry!\" answered Laura, bursting into\ntears and sobbing with grief; \"I was cutting off my hair with Mrs.\nCrabtree's scissors all the time that he was setting the nursery on\nfire!\"\n\n\"Did any mortal ever hear of two such little torments!\" exclaimed Major\nGraham, hardly able to help laughing. \"I wonder if anybody else in the\nworld has such mischievous children!\"\n\n\"It is certainly very strange, that you and Harry never can contrive to\nbe three hours out of a scrape!\" said Lady Harriet gravely; \"now Frank,\non the contrary, never forgets what I bid him do. You might suppose he\ncarried Mrs. Crabtree in his pocket, to remind him constantly of his\nduty; but there are not two such boys in the world as Frank!\"\n\n\"No,\" added Major Graham; \"Harry set the house on fire, and Frank will\nset the Thames on fire!\"\n\nWhen Laura saw uncle David put on one of his funny looks, while he spoke\nin this way to Lady Harriet, she almost forgot her former fright, and\nbecame surprised to observe her grandmama busy preparing what she called\na coach-wheel, which had been often given as a treat to Harry and\nherself when they were particularly good. This delightful wheel was\nmanufactured by taking a whole round slice of the loaf, in the centre of\nwhich was placed a large tea-spoonful of jelly, after which long spokes\nof marmalade, jam, and honey, were made to diverge most tastefully in\nevery direction towards the crust, and Laura watched the progress of\nthis business with great interest and anxiety, wondering if it could be\nhoped that her grandmama really meant to forgive all her misconduct\nduring the day.\n\n\"That coach-wheel is, of course, meant for me!\" said Major Graham,\npretending to be very hungry, and looking slyly at Laura; \"It cannot\npossibly be intended for our little hair-dresser here!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is!\" answered Lady Harriet, smiling. \"I have some thoughts of\nexcusing Laura this time, because she always tells me the truth, without\nattempting to conceal any foolish thing she does. It will be very long\nbefore she has any hair to cut off again, so I hope she may be older and\nwiser by that time, especially considering that every looking-glass she\nsees for six months will make her feel ashamed of herself. She certainly\ndeserves some reward for having prevented the house to-night from being\nburned to the ground.\"\n\n\"I am glad you think so, because here is a shilling that has been\nburning in my pocket for the last few minutes, as I wished to bestow it\non Laura for having saved all our lives, and if she had behaved still\nbetter, I might perhaps have given her a gold watch!\"\n\nLaura was busily employed in eating her coach-wheel, and trying to fancy\nwhat the gold watch would have looked like which she might probably have\ngot from uncle David, when suddenly the door burst open, and Mrs.\nCrabtree hurried into the room, with a look of surprise and alarm, her\nface as red as a poppy, and her eye fixed on the hole in her best gown,\nwhile she spoke so loud and angrily, that Laura almost trembled.\n\n\"If you please, my lady! where can Master Harry be? I cannot find him in\nany corner!--we have been searching all over the house, up stairs and\ndown stairs, in vain. Not a garret or a closet but has been ransacked,\nand nobody can guess what has become of him!\"\n\n\"Did you look up the chimney, Mrs. Crabtree?\" asked Major Graham,\nlaughing to see how excited she looked.\n\n\"Indeed, Sir! it is no joke,\" answered Mrs. Crabtree, sulkily; \"I am\nalmost afraid Master Harry has been burned in the fire! The last time\nBetty saw him, he was throwing a jug of water into the flames, and no\none has ever seen or heard of him since! There is a great many ashes and\ncinders lying about the room, and----\"\n\n\"Do you think, in sober seriousness, Mrs. Crabtree, that Harry would\nmelt away like a wax doll, without asking any body to extinguish him?\"\nsaid Major Graham, smiling. \"No! no! little boys are not quite so easily\ndisposed of. I shall find Harry in less than five minutes, if he is\nabove ground.\"\n\nBut uncle David was quite mistaken in expecting to discover Harry so\neasily, for he searched and searched in vain. He looked into every\npossible or impossible place--the library, the kitchen, the garrets, the\nlaundry, the drawing-room, all without success,--he peeped under the\ntables, behind the curtains, over the beds, beneath the pillows, and\ninto Mrs. Crabtree's bonnet-box,--he even opened the tea-chest, and\nlooked out at the window, in case Harry had tumbled over, but nowhere\ncould he be found.\n\n\"Not a mouse is stirring!\" exclaimed Major Graham, beginning now to look\nexceedingly grave and anxious. \"This is very strange! The house-door is\nlocked, therefore, unless Harry made his escape through the key-hole, he\nmust be here! It is most unaccountable what the little pickle can have\ndone with himself!\"\n\nWhen Major Graham chose to exert his voice, it was as loud as a trumpet,\nand could be heard half a mile off; so he now called out, like thunder,\nfrom the top of the stairs to the bottom, saying, \"Hollo, Harry! hollo!\nCome here, my boy! Nobody shall hurt you! Harry! where are you!\"\n\nUncle David waited to listen, but all was still,--no answer could be\nheard, and there was not a sound in the house, except poor Laura at the\nbottom of the stairs, sobbing with grief and terror about Harry having\nbeen lost, and Mrs. Crabtree grumbling angrily to herself, on account of\nthe large hole in her best gown.\n\nBy this time Lady Harriet nearly fainted with fatigue, for she was so\nvery old, and had been ill all day; so she grew worse and worse, till\neverybody said she must go to bed, and try if it would be possible to\nfall asleep, assuring her that Harry must soon be found, as nothing\nparticular could have happened to him, or some person would have seen\nit.\n\n\"Indeed, my lady! Master Harry is just like a bad shilling that is sure\nto come back,\" said Mrs. Crabtree, helping her to undress, while she\ncontinued to talk the whole time about the fire, showing her own\nunfortunate gown, describing the trouble she had taken to save the house\nfrom being burned, and always ending every sentence with a wish that she\ncould lay her hands on Harry to punish him as he deserved.\n\n\"The truth is, I just spoil and indulge the children too much, my lady!\"\nadded Mrs. Crabtree, in a self-satisfied tone of voice. \"I really blame\nmyself often for being over easy and kind.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to accuse yourself of in that respect,\" answered Lady\nHarriet, unable to help smiling.\n\n\"Your ladyship is very good to say so. Major Graham is so fond of our\nyoung people, that it is lucky they have some one to keep them in order.\nI shall make a duty, my lady, of being more strict than ever. Master\nHarry must be made an example of this time!\" added Mrs. Crabtree,\nangrily glancing at the hole in her gown. \"I shall teach him to\nremember this day the longest hour he has to live!\"\n\n\"Harry will not forget it any how,\" answered Lady Harriet languidly.\n\"Perhaps, Mrs. Crabtree, we might as well not be severe with the poor\nboy on this occasion. As the old proverb says, 'there is no use in\npouring water on a drowned mouse.' Harry has got a sad fright for his\npains, and at all events you must find him first, before he can be\npunished. Where can the poor child be hid?\"\n\n\"I would give sixpence to find out that, my lady!\" answered Mrs.\nCrabtree, helping Lady Harriet into bed, after which she closed the\nshutters, put out the candles, and left the room, angrily muttering,\n\"Master Harry cares no more for me than the poker cares for the tongs,\nbut I shall teach him another story soon.\"\n\nLady Harriet now feebly closed her eyes, being quite exhausted, and was\nbeginning to feel the pleasant, confused sensation that people have\nbefore going to sleep, when some noise made her suddenly start quite\nawake. She sat up in bed to listen, but could not be sure whether it had\nbeen a great noise at a distance, or a little noise in the room; so\nafter waiting two or three minutes, she sunk back upon the pillows, and\ntried to forget it. Again, however, she distinctly heard something\nrustling in the bed curtains, and opened her eyes to see what could be\nthe matter, but all was dark. Something seemed to be breathing very near\nher, however, and the curtains shook worse than before, till Lady\nHarriet became really alarmed.\n\n\"It must surely be a cat in the room!\" thought she, hastily pulling the\nbell rope, till it nearly came down. \"That tiresome little animal will\nmake such a noise, I shall not be able to sleep all night!\"\n\nThe next minute Lady Harriet was startled to hear a loud sob close\nbeside her; and when everybody rushed up stairs to ask what was the\nmatter, they brought candles to search the room, and there was Harry!\nHe lay doubled up in a corner, and crying as if his heart would break,\nyet still endeavouring not to be seen; for Harry always thought it a\nterrible disgrace to cry, and would have concealed himself anywhere,\nrather than be observed weeping. Laura burst into tears also, when she\nsaw what red eyes and pale cheeks Harry had; but Mrs. Crabtree lost no\ntime in pulling him out of his place, being quite impatient to begin her\nscold, and to produce her tawse, though she received a sad\ndisappointment on this occasion, as uncle David unexpectedly interfered\nto get him off.\n\n\"Come now, Mrs. Crabtree,\" said he good-naturedly; \"put up the tawse for\nthis time; you are rather too fond of the leather. Harry seems really\nsorry and frightened, so we must be merciful. That cataract of tears he\nis shedding now, would have extinguished the fire if it had come in\ntime! Harry is like a culprit with the rope about his neck; but he shall\nnot be executed. Let me be judge and jury in this case; and my sentence\nis a very dreadful one. Harry must sleep all to-night in the burned\nnursery, having no other covering than the burned blankets, with large\nholes in them, that he may never forget\n\n                              \"THE TERRIBLE FIRE!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE PRODIGIOUS CAKE.\n\n                            Yet theirs the joy\n  That lifts their steps, that sparkles in their eyes;\n  That talks or laughs, or runs, or shouts, or plays,\n  And speaks in all their looks, and all their ways.\n\n                                        Crabbe.\n\n\nNext day after the fire, Laura could think of nothing but what she was\nto do with the shilling that uncle David had given her; and a thousand\nplans came into her head, while many wants entered her thoughts, which\nnever occurred before; so that, if twenty shillings had been in her hand\ninstead of one, they would all have gone twenty different ways.\n\nLady Harriet advised that it should be laid bye till Laura had fully\nconsidered what she would like best; reminding her very truly, that\nmoney is lame in coming, but flies in going away. \"Many people can get a\nshilling, Laura,\" said her grandmama; \"but the difficulty is to keep it;\nfor you know the old proverb tells that 'a fool and his money are soon\nparted.'\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss! so give it to me, and I shall take care of your shilling!\"\nadded Mrs. Crabtree, holding out her hand to Laura, who fell that if her\nmoney once disappeared into that capacious pocket, she would never see\nit again. \"Children have no use for money! that shilling will only burn\na hole in your purse, till it is spent on some foolish thing or other.\nYou will be losing your thimble soon, or mislaying your gloves; for all\nthese things seem to fly in every direction, as if they got legs and\nwings as soon as they belong to you; so then that shilling may replace\nwhat is lost.\"\n\nMrs. Crabtree looked as if she would eat it up; but Laura grasped her\ntreasure still tighter in her hand, exclaiming,\n\n\"No! no! this is mine! Uncle David never thought of my shilling being\ntaken care of! He meant me to do whatever I liked with it! Uncle David\nsays he cannot endure saving children, and that he wishes all money were\nturned into slates, when little girls keep it longer than a week.\"\n\n\"I like that!\" said Harry, eagerly; \"it is so pleasant to spend money,\nwhen the shopkeeper bows to me over the counter so politely, and asks\nwhat I please to want.\"\n\n\"Older people than you like spending money, Master Harry, and spend\nwhether they have it or no; but the greatest pleasure is to keep it. For\ninstance, Miss Laura, whatever she sees worth a shilling in any shop,\nmight be hers if she pleases; so then it is quite as good as her own. We\nshall look in at the bazaar every morning, to fix upon something that\nshe would like to have, and then consider of it for two or three days.\"\n\nLaura thought this plan so very unsatisfactory, that she lost no time in\ngetting her shilling changed into two sixpences, one of which she\nimmediately presented to Harry, who positively refused for a long time\nto accept of it, insisting that Laura should rather buy some pretty\nplaything for herself; but she answered that it was much pleasanter to\ndivide her fortune with Harry, than to be selfish, and spend it all\nalone. \"I am sure, Harry,\" added she, \"if this money had been yours, you\nwould have said the same thing, and given the half of what you got to\nme; so now let us say no more about that, but tell me what would be the\nbest use to make of my sixpence?\"\n\n\"You might buy that fine red morocco purse we saw in the shop window\nyesterday,\" observed Harry, looking very serious and anxious, on being\nconsulted. \"Do you remember how much we both wished to have it?\"\n\n\"But what is the use of a purse, with no money to keep in it!\" answered\nLaura, looking earnestly at Harry for more advice. \"Think again of\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"Would you like a new doll?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I have nothing to dress her with!\"\n\n\"Suppose you buy that pretty geranium in a red flower-pot at the\ngardener's!\"\n\n\"If it would only live for a week, I might be tempted to try; but\nflowers will always die with me. They seem to wither when I so much as\nlook at them. Do you remember that pretty fuchsia that I almost drowned\nthe first day grandmama gave it me; and we forgot for a week afterwards\nto water it at all. I am not a good flower doctor.\"\n\n\"Then buy a gold watch at once,\" said Harry, laughing; \"or a fine pony,\nwith a saddle, to ride on.\"\n\n\"Now, Harry, pray be quite in earnest. You know I might as well attempt\nto buy the moon as a gold watch; so think of something else.\"\n\n\"It is very difficult to make a good use of money,\" said Harry,\npretending to look exceedingly wise. \"Do you know, Laura, I once found\nout that you could have twelve of those large ship biscuits we saw at\nthe baker's shop for sixpence. Only think! you could feed the whole\ntown, and make a present to everybody in the house besides! I dare say\nMrs. Crabtree might like one with her tea. All the maids would think\nthem a treat. You could present one to Frank, another to old Andrew, and\nthere would still be some left for these poor children at the cottage.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is the very thing!\" cried Laura, running out of the room to\nsend Andrew off with a basket, and looking as happy as possible. Not\nlong afterwards, Frank, who had returned from school, was standing at\nthe nursery window, when he suddenly called out in a voice of surprise\nand amazement,\n\n\"Come here, Harry! look at old Andrew! he is carrying something tied up\nin a towel, as large as his own head! what can it be?\"\n\n\"That is all for me! these are my biscuits!\" said Laura, running off to\nreceive the parcel, and though she heard Frank laughing, while Harry\ntold all about them, she did not care, but brought her whole collection\ntriumphantly into the nursery.\n\n\"Oh fancy! how perfect!\" cried Harry, opening the bundle; \"this is very\ngood fun!\"\n\n\"Here are provisions for a siege!\" added Frank. \"You have at least got\nenough for your money, Laura!\"\n\n\"Take one yourself, Frank!\" said she, reaching him the largest, and\nthen, with the rest all tied in her apron, Laura proceeded up and down\nstairs, making presents to every person she met, till her whole store\nwas finished; and she felt quite satisfied and happy because everybody\nseemed pleased and returned many thanks, except Mrs. Crabtree, who said\nshe had no teeth to eat such hard things, which were only fit for\nsailors going to America or the West Indies.\n\n\"You should have bought me a pound of sugar, Miss Laura, and that might\nhave been a present worth giving.\"\n\n\"You are too sweet already, Mrs. Crabtree!\" said Frank, laughing. \"I\nshall send you a sugar-cane from the West Indies, to beat Harry and\nLaura with, and a whole barrel of sugar for yourself, from my own\nestate.\"\n\n\"None of your nonsense, Master Frank! Get out of the nursery this\nmoment! You with an estate indeed! You will not have a place to put your\nfoot upon soon except the topmast in a man-of-war, where all the bad\nboys in a ship are sent.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, as you are not to be the captain, I may escape, and be dining\nwith the officers sometimes! I mean to send you home a fine new India\nshawl, Mrs. Crabtree, the very moment I arrive at Madras, and some china\ntea-cups from Canton.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks and nonsense!\" said Mrs. Crabtree, who sometimes enjoyed a\nlittle jesting with Frank. \"Keep all them rattle-traps till you are a\nrich nabob, and come home to look for Mrs. Frank,--a fine wife she will\nbe! Ladies that get fortunes from India are covered all over with gold\nchains, and gold muslins, and scarlet shawls. She will eat nothing but\ncurry and rice, and never put her foot to the ground except to step into\nher carriage.\"\n\n\"I hope you are not a gipsey, to tell fortunes!\" cried Harry, laughing;\n\"Frank would die rather than take such a wife.\"\n\n\"Or, at least, I would rather have a tooth drawn than do it,\" added\nFrank, smiling. \"Perhaps I may prefer to marry one of those old wives on\nthe chimney-tops; but it is too serious to say I would rather die,\nbecause nobody knows how awful it is to die, till the appointed day\ncomes.\"\n\n\"Very true and proper, Master Frank,\" replied Mrs. Crabtree; \"you speak\nlike a printed book sometimes, and you deserve a good wife.\"\n\n\"Then I shall return home some day with chests of gold, and let you\nchoose one for me, as quiet and good-natured as yourself, Mrs.\nCrabtree,\" said Frank, taking up his books and hastening off to school,\nrunning all the way, as he was rather late, and Mr. Lexicon, the master,\nhad promised a grand prize for the boy who came most punctually to his\nlessons, which everybody declared that Frank was sure to gain, as he had\nnever once been absent at the right moment.\n\nMajor Graham often tried to teaze Frank, by calling him \"the\nProfessor,\"--asking him questions which it was impossible to answer,\nand then pretending to be quite shocked at his ignorance; but no one\never saw the young scholar put out of temper by those tricks and trials,\nfor he always laughed more heartily than any one else, at the joke.\n\n\"Now show me, Frank,\" said uncle David, one morning, \"how do you advance\nthree steps backwards?\"\n\n\"That is quite impossible, unless you turn me into a crab.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, which is the principal town in Caffraria?\"\n\n\"Is there any town there? I do not recollect it.\"\n\n\"Then so much the worse!--how are you ever to get through life without\nknowing the chief town in Caffraria! I am quite ashamed of your\nignorance. Now let us try a little arithmetic! Open the door of your\nunderstanding and tell me, when wheat is six shillings a bushel, what is\nthe price of a penny loaf. Take your slate and calculate that.\"\n\n\"Yes, uncle David, if you will find out, when gooseberries are two\nshillings the pint, what is the price of a threepenny tart. You remind\nme of my old nursery song--\n\n  'The man in the wilderness asked me,\n  How many strawberries grew in the sea;\n  I answered him, as I thought it good,\n  As many red herrings as grew in the wood.'\"\n\nSome days after Laura had distributed the biscuits, she became very\nsorry for having squandered her shilling, without attending to Lady\nHarriet's good advice, about keeping it carefully in her pocket for at\nleast a week, to see what would happen. A very pleasant way of using\nmoney now fell in her way, but she had been a foolish spendthrift, so\nher pockets were empty, when she most wished them to be full. Harry came\nthat morning after breakfast into the nursery, looking in a great\nbustle, and whispering to Laura, \"What a pity your sixpence is gone! but\nas Mrs. Crabtree says, 'we cannot both eat our cake and have it!'\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Laura, as seriously as if she had never thought of this\nbefore, \"but why do you so particularly wish my money back to-day?\"\n\n\"Because such a very nice, funny thing is to be done this morning. You\nand I are asked to join the party, but I am afraid we cannot afford it!\nAll our little cousins and companions intend going with Mr. Harwood, the\ntutor, at twelve o'clock, to climb up to the very top of Arthur's Seat,\nwhere they are to dine and have a dance. There will be about twenty boys\nand girls of the party, but every body is to carry a basket filled with\nprovisions for dinner, either cakes, or fruit, or biscuits, which are to\nbe eat on the great rock at the top of the hill. Now grandmama says we\nought to have had money enough to supply what is necessary, and then we\nmight have gone, but no one can be admitted who has not at least\nsixpence to buy something.\"\n\n\"Oh! how provoking!\" said Laura, sadly, \"I wonder when we shall learn\nalways to follow grandmama's advice, for that is sure to turn out best\nin the end. I never take my own way without being sorry for it\nafterwards, so I deserve now to be disappointed and remain at home; but,\nHarry, your sixpence is still safe, so pray join this delightful party,\nand tell me all about it afterwards.\"\n\n\"If it could take us both, I should be very happy, but I will not go\nwithout you, Laura, after you were so good to me, and gave me this in a\npresent. No, no! I only wish we could do like the poor madman grandmama\nmentioned, who planted sixpences in the ground that they might grow into\nshillings.\"\n\n\"Pray! what are you two looking so solemn about?\" asked Frank, hurrying\ninto the room, at that moment, on his way to school. \"Are you talking of\nsome mischief that has been done already, or only about some mischief\nyou are intending to do soon?\"\n\n\"Neither the one nor the other,\" answered Laura. \"But, oh! Frank, I am\nsure you will be sorry for us, when we tell you of our sad\ndisappointment!\"\n\nShe then related the whole story of the party to Arthur's Seat,\nmentioning that Mr. Harwood had kindly offered to take charge of Harry\nand herself, but as her little fortune had been so foolishly squandered,\nshe could not go, and Harry said it would be impossible to enjoy the fun\nwithout her, though Lady Harriet had given them both leave to be of the\nparty.\n\nAll the time that Laura spoke, Frank stood, with his hands in his\npockets, where he seemed evidently searching for something, and when the\nwhole history was told, he said to Harry, \"Let me see this poor little\nsixpence of yours! I am a very clever conjuror, and could perhaps turn\nit into a shilling!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Frank!\" said Laura, laughing; \"you might as well turn Harry\ninto uncle David!\"\n\n\"Well! we shall see!\" answered Frank, taking up the sixpence. \"I have\nput the money into this box!--rattle it well!--once! twice!\nthrice!--there, peep in!--now it is a shilling! I told you so!\"\n\nFrank ran joyously out of the room, being much amused with the joke, for\nhe had put one of his own shillings into the box for Harry and Laura,\nwho were excessively surprised at first, and felt really ashamed to take\nthis very kind present from Frank, when he so seldom had money of his\nown; but they knew how generous he was, for he often repeated that\nexcellent maxim, \"It is more blessed to give than to receive.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes, they remembered that nothing could prevent them now\nfrom going with Mr. Harwood to Arthur's Seat, which put Laura into such\na state of ecstacy, that she danced round the room for joy, while Harry\njumped upon the tables and chairs, tumbled head over heels, and called\nBetty to come immediately that they might get ready.\n\nWhen Mrs. Crabtree heard such an uproar, she hastened also into the\nroom, asking what had happened to cause this riot, and she became very\nangry indeed, to hear that Harry and Laura had both got leave to join in\nthis grand expedition.\n\n\"You will be spoiling all your clothes, and getting yourselves into a\nheat! I wonder her ladyship allows this! How much better you would be\ntaking a quiet walk with me in the gardens! I shall really speak to Lady\nHarriet about it! The air must be very cold on the top of them great\nmountains! I am sure you will both have colds for a month after this\nTom-foolery.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Mrs. Crabtree! I promise not to catch cold!\" cried Harry,\neagerly; \"and, besides, you can scarcely prevent our going now, for\ngrandmama has set out on her long airing in the carriage, so there is\nnobody for you to ask about keeping us at home, except uncle David!\"\n\nMrs. Crabtree knew from experience, that Major Graham was a hopeless\ncase, as he always took part with the children, and liked nothing so\nmuch for old and young as \"a ploy;\" so she grumbled on to herself, while\nher eyes looked as sharp as a pair of scissors with rage. \"You will come\nback, turned into scare-crows, with all your nice clean clothes in\ntatters,\" said she, angrily; \"but if there is so much as a speck upon\nthis best new jacket and trowsers, I shall know the reason why.\"\n\n\"What a comfort it would be, if there were no such things in the world\nas 'new clothes,' for I am always so much happier in the old ones,\" said\nHarry. \"People at the shops should sell clothes that will never either\ndirty or tear!\"\n\n\"You ought to be dressed in fur, like Robinson Crusoe, or sent out\nnaked, like the little savages,\" said Mrs. Crabtree, \"or painted black\nand blue like them wild old Britons that lived here long ago!\"\n\n\"I am black and blue sometimes, without being painted,\" said Harry,\nescaping to the door. \"Good-bye, Mrs. Crabtree! I hope you will not die\nof weariness without us! On our return we shall tell you all our\ndelightful adventures.\"\n\nAbout half an hour afterwards, Harry and Laura were seen hurrying out of\nthe pastry-cook, Mrs. Weddell's shop, bearing little covered baskets in\ntheir hands, but nobody could guess what was in them. They whispered and\nlaughed together with very merry faces, looking the very pictures of\nhappiness, and running along as fast as they could to join the noisy\nparty of their cousins and companions, almost fearing that Mr. Harwood\nmight have set off without them. Frank often called him \"Mr.\nPunctuality,\" as he was so very particular about his scholars being in\ngood time on all occasions; and certainly Mr. Harwood carried his watch\nmore in his hand than in his pocket, being in the habit of constantly\nlooking to see that nobody arrived too late. Mail-coaches or steamboats\ncould hardly keep the time better, when an hour had once been named, and\nthe last words that Harry heard when he was invited were, \"Remember!\nsharp twelve.\"\n\nThe great clock of St. Andrew's Church was busy striking that hour, and\nevery little clock in the town was saying the same thing, when Mr.\nHarwood himself, with his watch in his hand, opened the door, and walked\nout, followed by a dozen of merry-faced boys and girls, all speaking at\nonce, and vociferating louder than the clocks, as if they thought\neverybody had grown deaf.\n\n\"I shall reach the top of Arthur's Seat first,\" said Peter Grey. \"All of\nyou follow me, for I know the shortest way. It is only a hop, step, and\na jump!\"\n\n\"Rather a long step!\" cried Robert Fordyce. \"But I could lead you a much\nbetter way, though I shall show it to nobody but myself.\"\n\n\"We must certainly drink water at St. Anthony's Well,\" observed Laura;\n\"because whatever any one wishes for when he tastes it, is sure to\nhappen immediately.\"\n\n\"Then I shall wish that some person may give me a new doll,\" said Mary\nForrester. \"My old one is only fit for being lady's maid to a fine new\ndoll.\"\n\n\"I am in ninety-nine minds what to wish for,\" exclaimed Harry; \"we must\ntake care not to be like the foolish old woman in the fairy tale, who\ngot only a yard of black pudding.\"\n\n\"I shall ask for a piebald pony, with a whip, a saddle, and a bridle!\"\ncried Peter Grey; \"and for a week's holidays,--and a new watch,--and a\nspade,--and a box of French plums,--and to be first at the top of\nArthur's Seat,--and--and--\"\n\n\"Stop, Peter!--stop! you can only have one wish at St. Anthony's Well,\"\ninterrupted Mr. Harwood. \"If you ask more, you lose all.\"\n\n\"That is very hard, for I want everything,\" replied Peter. \"What are you\nwishing for, Sir?\"\n\n\"What shall I ask for?\" said Mr. Harwood, reflecting to himself. \"I have\nnot a want in the world?\"\n\n\"O yes, Sir! you must wish for something!\" cried the whole party,\neagerly. \"Do invent something to ask, Mr. Harwood!\"\n\n\"Then I wish you may all behave well till we reach the top of Arthur's\nSeat, and all come safely down again.\"\n\n\"You may be sure of that already!\" said Peter, laughing. \"I set such a\nvery good example to all my companions, that they never behave ill when\nI am present,--no! not even by accident! When Dr. Algebra examined our\nclass to-day, he asked Mr. Lexicon, 'What has become of the best boy in\nyour school this morning?' and the answer was, 'Of course your mean\nPeter Grey! He is gone to the top of Arthur's Seat with that excellent\nman, Mr. Harwood!'\"\n\n\"Indeed!--and pray, Master Peter, what bird whispered this story into\nyour ear, seeing it has all happened since we left home!--but people who\nare praised by nobody else, often take to praising themselves!\"\n\n\"Who knows better!--and here is Harry Graham, the very ditto of\nmyself,--so steady he might be fit to drill a whole regiment. We shall\nlead the party quite safely up the hill, and down again, without any\nladders.\"\n\n\"And without wings,\" added Harry, laughing; \"but what are we to draw\nwater out of the well with?--here are neither buckets, nor tumblers, nor\nglasses!\"\n\n\"I could lend you my thimble!\" said Laura, searching her pocket. \"That\nwill hold enough of water for one wish, and every person may have the\nloan of it in turn.\"\n\n\"This is the very first time your thimble has been of use to anybody!\"\nsaid Harry, slyly; \"but I dare say it is not worn into holes with too\nmuch sewing, therefore it will make a famous little magical cup for St.\nAnthony's Well. You know the fairies who dance here by moonlight, lay\ntheir table-cloth upon a mushroom, and sit round it, to be merry, but I\nnever heard what they use for a drinking cup.\"\n\nHarry now proceeded briskly along to the well, singing as he went, a\nsong which had been taught him by uncle David, beginning,\n\n  I wish I were a brewer's horse,\n  Five quarters of a year,\n  I'd place my head where was my tail,\n  And drink up all the beer.\n\nBefore long the whole party seated themselves in a circle on the grass\nround St. Anthony's Well, while any stranger who had chanced to pass\nmight have supposed, from the noise and merriment, that the Saint had\nfilled his well with champagne and punch for the occasion, as everybody\nseemed perfectly tipsy with happiness. Mr. Harwood laughed prodigiously\nat some of the jokes, and made a few of his own, which were none of the\nbest, though they caused the most laughter, for the boys thought it very\nsurprising that so grave and great a man should make a joke at all.\n\nWhen Mary Forrester drank her thimbleful of water, and wished for a new\ndoll, Peter and Harry privately cut out a face upon a red-cheeked apple,\nmaking the eyes, nose, and mouth, after which, they hastily dressed it\nup in pocket handkerchiefs, and gave her this present from the fairies,\nwhich looked so very like what she had asked for, that the laugh which\nfollowed was loud and long. Afterwards Peter swallowed his draught,\ncalling loudly for a piebald pony, when Harry in his white trowsers, and\ndark jacket, went upon all-fours, and let Peter mount on his back. It\nwas very difficult, however, to get Peter off again, for he enjoyed the\nfun excessively, and stuck to his seat like Sinbad's old man of the sea,\ntill at last Harry rolled round on his back, tumbling Peter head over\nheels into St. Anthony's Well, upon seeing which, Mr. Harwood rose,\nsaying, he had certainly lost his own wish, as they had behaved ill, and\nmet with an accident already. Harry laughingly proposed that Peter\nshould be carefully hung upon a tree to dry, till they all came down\nagain; but the mischievous boy ran off so fast, he was almost out of\nsight in a moment, saying, \"Now for the top of Arthur's Seat, and I\nshall grow dry with the fatigue of climbing.\"\n\nThe boys and girls immediately scattered themselves all over the hill,\ngetting on the best way they could, and trying who could scramble up\nfastest, but the grass was quite short, and as slippery as ice,\ntherefore it became every moment more difficult to stand, and still more\ndifficult to climb. The whole party began sliding whether they liked it\nor not, and staggered and tried to grasp the turf, but there was nothing\nto hold, while occasionally a shower of stones and gravel came down from\nPeter, who pretended they fell by accident.\n\n\"Oh, Harry!\" cried Laura, panting for breath, while she looked both\nfrightened and fatigued, \"If this were not a party of pleasure, I think\nwe are sometimes quite as happy in our own gardens! People must be very\nmiserable at home, before they come here to be amused! I wish we were\ncats, or goats, or any thing that can stand upon a hill without feeling\ngiddy.\"\n\n\"I think this is very good fun!\" answered Harry, gasping and trying not\nto tumble for the twentieth time; \"you would like perhaps to be back in\nthe nursery with Mrs. Crabtree.\"\n\n\"No! no! I am not quite so bad as that! But Harry! do you ever really\nexpect to reach the top? for I never shall; so I mean to sit down\nquietly here, and wait till you all return.\"\n\n\"I have a better plan than that, Laura! you shall sit upon the highest\npoint of Arthur's Seat as well as anybody, before either of us is an\nhour older! Let me go first, because I get on famously, and you must\nnever look behind, but keep tight hold of my jacket, so then every step\nI advance will pull you up also.\"\n\nLaura was delighted with this plan, which succeeded perfectly well, but\nthey ascended rather slowly, as it was exceedingly fatiguing to Harry,\nwho looked quite happy all the time to be of use, for he always felt\nglad when he could do any thing for anybody, more particularly for\neither Laura or Frank. Now, the whole party was at last safely assembled\non the very highest point of Arthur's Seat, so the boys threw their caps\nup in the air, and gave three tremendous cheers, which frightened the\nvery crows over their heads, and sent a flock of sheep scampering down\nthe mountain side. After that, they planted Mr. Harwood's walking-stick\nin the ground, for a staff, while Harry tore off the blue silk\nhandkerchief which Mrs. Crabtree had tied about his neck, and without\ncaring whether he caught cold or not, he fastened it on the pole for a\nflag, being quite delighted to see how it waved in the wind most\ntriumphantly, looking very like what sailors put up when they take\npossession of a desert island.\n\n\"Now, for business!\" said Mr. Harwood, sitting down on the rock, and\nuncovering a prodigious cake, nearly as large as a cheese, which he had\ntaken the trouble to carry, with great difficulty, up the hill. \"I\nsuppose nobody is hungry after our long walk! Let us see what all the\nbaskets contain!\"\n\nNot a moment was lost in seating themselves on the grass, while the\nstores were displayed, amidst shouts of laughter and applause which\ngenerally followed whatever came forth. Sandwiches, or, as Peter Grey\ncalled them, \"savages;\" gingerbread, cakes, and fruit, all appeared in\nturn. Robert Fordyce brought a dozen of hard-boiled eggs, all dyed\ndifferent colours, blue, green, pink, and yellow, but not one was white.\nEdmund Ashford produced a collection of very sour-looking apples, and\nCharles Forrester showed a number of little gooseberry tarts, but when\nit became time for Peter's basket to be opened, it contained nothing\nexcept a knife and fork to cut up whatever his companions would give\nhim!\n\n\"Peter! Peter! you shabby fellow!\" said Charles Forrester, reaching him\none of his tarts, \"you should be put in the tread-mill as a sturdy\nbeggar!\"\n\n\"Or thrown down from the top of this precipice,\" added Harry, giving him\na cake. \"I wonder you can look any of us in the face, Peter!\"\n\n\"I have heard,\" said Mr. Harwood, \"that a stone is shown in Ireland,\ncalled 'the stone of Blarney,' and whoever kisses it, is never\nafterwards ashamed of any thing he does. Our friend Peter has probably\npassed that way lately!\"\n\n\"At any rate, I am not likely to be starved to death amongst you all!\"\nanswered the impudent boy, demolishing every thing he could get; and it\nis believed that Peter ate, on this memorable occasion, three times more\nthan any other person, as each of the party offered him something, and\nhe never was heard to say, \"No!\"\n\n\"I could swallow Arthur's Seat if it were turned into a plum-pudding,\"\nsaid he, pocketing buns, apples, eggs, walnuts, biscuits, and almonds,\ntill his coat stuck out all round like a balloon. \"Has any one any thing\nmore to spare?\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear,\" said Mr. Harwood, \"that a pigeon eats its own\nweight of food every day? Now, I am sure, you and I know one boy in the\nworld, Peter, who could do as much.\"\n\n\"What is to be done with that prodigious cake you carried up here, Mr.\nHarwood?\" answered Peter, casting a devouring eye upon it; \"the crust\nseems as hard as a rhinoceros' skin, but I dare say it is very good. One\ncould not be sure though, without tasting it! I hope you are not going\nto take the trouble of carrying that heavy load back again?\"\n\n\"How very polite you are become all on a sudden, Peter!\" said Laura,\nlaughing. \"I should be very sorry to attempt carrying that cake to the\nbottom of the hill, for we would both roll down, the shortest way,\ntogether.\"\n\n\"I am not over-anxious to try it either,\" observed Charles Forrester,\nshaking his head. \"Even Peter, though his mouth is constantly ajar,\nwould find that cake rather heavy to carry, either as an inside or an\noutside passenger.\"\n\n\"I can scarcely lift it at all!\" continued Laura, when Mr. Harwood had\nagain tied it up in the towel; \"what can be done?\"\n\n\"Here is the very best plan!\" cried Harry, suddenly seizing the\nprodigious cake; and before any body could hinder him, he gave it a\ntremendous push off the steepest part of Arthur's Seat, so that it\nrolled down like a wheel, over stones and precipices, jumping and\nhopping along with wonderful rapidity, amidst the cheers and laughter of\nall the children, till at last it reached the bottom of the hill, when a\ngeneral clapping of hands ensued.\n\n\"Now for a race!\" cried Harry, becoming more and more eager. \"The first\nboy or girl who reaches that cake shall have it all to himself!\"\n\nMr. Harwood tried with all his might to stop the commotion, and called\nout that they must go quietly down the bank, for Harry had no right to\ngive away the cake, or to make them break their legs and arms with\nracing down such a hill: but he might as well have spoken to an east\nwind, and asked it not to blow. The whole party dispersed, like a hive\nof bees that has been upset; and in a moment they were in full career\nafter the cake.\n\nSome of the boys tried to roll down, hoping to get on more quickly.\nOthers endeavoured to slide, and several attempted to run, but they all\nfell; and many of them might have been tumblers at Sadler's Wells, they\ntumbled over and over so cleverly. Peter Grey's hat was blown away, but\nhe did not stop to catch it. Charlie Hume lost his shoe, Robert Fordyce\nsprained his ancle, and every one of the girls tore her frock. It was a\nfrightful scene; such devastation of bonnets and jackets as had never\nbeen known before; while Mr. Harwood looked like the General of a\ndefeated army, calling till he became hoarse, and running till he was\nout of breath, vainly trying thus to stop the confusion, and to bring\nthe stragglers back in better order.\n\nMeantime, Harry and Peter were far before the rest, though Edward\nAshford was following hard after them in desperate haste, as if he still\nhoped to overtake their steps. Suddenly, however, a loud cry of distress\nwas heard over-head; and when Harry looked up, he saw so very alarming a\nsight, that he could scarcely believe his eyes, and almost screamed out\nhimself with the fright it gave him, while he seemed to forget in a\nmoment, the race, Peter Grey, and the prodigious cake.\n\nLaura had been very anxious not to trouble Harry with taking care of her\nin coming down the bank again; for she saw that during all this fun\nabout the cake, he perfectly forgot that she was not accustomed every\nday to such a scramble on the hills, and would have required some help.\nAfter looking down every side of the descent, and thinking that each\nappeared steeper than another, while they all made her equally giddy,\nLaura determined to venture on a part of the hill which seemed rather\nless precipitous than the rest; but it completely cheated her, being the\nmost difficult and dangerous part of Arthur's Seat. The slope became\nsteeper and steeper at every step; but Laura always tried to hope her\npath might grow better, till at last she reached a place where it was\nimpossible to stop herself. Down she went, down! down! whether she would\nor not, screaming and sliding on a long slippery bank, till she reached\nthe very edge of a dangerous precipice, which appeared higher than the\nside of a room. Laura then grappled hold of some stones and grass,\ncalling loudly for help, while scarcely able to keep from falling into\nthe deep ravine, which would probably have killed her. Her screams were\nechoed all over the hill, when Harry seeing her frightful situation,\nclambered up the bank faster than any lamplighter, and immediately flew\nto Laura's assistance, who was now really hanging over the chasm, quite\nunable to help herself. At last he reached the place where poor Laura\nlay, and seized hold of her by the frock; but for some time it seemed an\nequal chance whether she dragged him into the hole, or he pulled her\naway from it. Luckily, however, by a great effort, Harry succeeded in\ndelivering Laura, whom he placed upon a secure situation, and then,\nhaving waited patiently till she recovered from the fright, he led her\ncarefully and kindly down to the bottom of Arthur's Seat.\n\nNow, all the boys had already got there, and a violent dispute was going\non about which of them first reached the cake. Peter Grey had pushed\ndown Edward Ashford, who caught hold of Robert Fordyce, and they all\nthree rolled to the bottom together, so that nobody could tell which had\nwon the race; while Mr. Harwood laboured in vain to convince them that\nthe cake belonged neither to the one nor the other, being his own\nproperty.\n\nThey all laughed at Harry for being distanced, and arriving last; while\nMr. Harwood watched him coming down, and was pleased to observe how\ncarefully he attended to Laura, though still, being annoyed at the riot\nand confusion which Harry had occasioned, he determined to appear\nexceedingly angry, and put on a very terrible voice, saying,\n\n\"Hollo! young gentleman! what shall I do to you for beginning this\nuproar? As the old proverb says, 'one fool makes many.' How dare you\nroll my fine cake down the hill in this way, and send everybody rolling\nafter it? Look me in the face, and say you are ashamed of yourself!\"\n\nHarry looked at Mr. Harwood--and Mr. Harwood looked at Harry. They both\ntried to seem very grave and serious, but somehow Harry's eyes glittered\nvery brightly, and two little dimples might be seen in his cheeks. Mr.\nHarwood also had his eye-brows gathered into a terrible frown, but still\nhis eyes were likewise sparkling, and his mouth seemed to be pursed up\nin a most comical manner. After staring at each other for several\nminutes, both Mr. Harwood and Harry burst into a prodigious fit of\nlaughing, and nobody could tell which began first or laughed longest.\n\n\"Master Graham! you must send a new frock to every little girl of the\nparty, and a suit of clothes to each of the boys, for having caused\ntheirs to be all destroyed. I really meant to punish you severely for\nbeginning such a riot, but something has made me change my mind. In\nalmost every moment of our lives, we either act amiably of unamiably,\nand I observed you treat Miss Laura so kindly and properly all this\nmorning, that I shall say not another word about\n\n                              \"THE PRODIGIOUS CAKE.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE LAST CLEAN FROCK.\n\n  \"For,\" said she, in spite of what grandmama taught her,\n  \"I'm really remarkably fond of the water.\"\n\n         *       *       *       *       *\n\n  She splashed, and she dashed, and she turned herself round,\n  And heartily wished herself safe on the ground.\n\n\nOnce upon a time Harry and Laura had got into so many scrapes, that\nthere seemed really no end to their misconduct. They generally forgot to\nlearn any lessons--often tore their books--drew pictures on their\nslates, instead of calculating sums--and made the pages of their\ncopy-books into boats; besides which, Mrs. Crabtree caught them one day,\nwhen a party of officers dined at Lady Harriet's, with two of the\ncaptain's sword-belts buckled round their waists, and cocked hats upon\ntheir heads, while they beat the crown of a gentleman's hat with a\nwalking-stick, to sound like a drum.\n\nStill it seemed impossible to make uncle David feel sufficiently angry\nat them, though Mrs. Crabtree did all she could to put him in a passion,\nby telling the very worst; but he made fifty excuses a-minute, as if he\nhad been the naughty person himself, instead of Harry or Laura, and\nabove all he said that they both seemed so exceedingly penitent when he\nexplained their delinquencies, and they were both so ready to tell upon\nthemselves, and to take all the blame of whatever mischief might be\ndone, that he was determined to shut his eyes and say nothing, unless\nthey did something purposely wrong.\n\nOne night, when Mrs. Crabtree had gone out, Major Graham felt quite\nsurprised on his return home from a late dinner party, to find Laura and\nHarry still out of bed. They were sitting in his library when he\nentered, both looking so tired and miserable that he could not imagine\nwhat had happened; but Harry lost no time in confessing that he and\nLaura feared they had done some dreadful mischief, so they could not\nsleep without asking pardon, and mentioning whose fault it was, that the\nmaids might not be unjustly blamed.\n\n\"Well, you little imps of mischief! what have I to scold you for now?\"\nasked uncle David, not looking particularly angry. \"Is it something that\nI shall be obliged to take the trouble of punishing you for? We ought to\nlive in the Highlands, where there are whole forests of birch ready for\nuse? Why are your ears like a bell-rope, Harry? because they seem made\nto be pulled. Now, go on with your story. What is the matter?\"\n\n\"We were playing about the room, uncle David, and Laura lost her ball,\nso she crept under that big table which has only one large leg. There is\na brass button below, so we were trying if it would come off, when all\non a sudden, the table fell quite to one side, as you see it now,\ntumbling down those prodigious books and tin boxes on the floor! I\ncannot think how this fine new table could be so easily broken; but\nwhenever we even look at anything, it seems to break!\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry! You remind me of Meddlesome Matty in the nursery rhymes,\n\n  \"Sometimes she'd lift the teapot lid\n  To peep at what was in it,\n  Or tilt the kettle, if you did\n  But turn your back a minute.\n  In vain you told her not to touch,\n  Her trick of meddling grew so much.\"\n\nYou have scarcely left my poor table a leg to stand upon! How am I ever\nto get it mended?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the carpenter could do it to-morrow!\"\n\n\"Or, perhaps uncle David could do it this moment,\" said Major Graham,\nraising the fallen side with a sudden jerk, when Harry and Laura heard a\nsound under the table like the locking of a door, after which the whole\naffair was rectified.\n\n\"Did I ever--!\" exclaimed Harry, staring with astonishment, \"so we have\nsuffered all our fright for nothing, and the table was not really\nbroken! I shall always run to you, uncle David, when we are in a scrape,\nfor you are sure to get us off.\"\n\n\"Do not reckon too certainly on that, Master Harry; it is easier to get\ninto one than to get out of it, any day; but I am not so seriously angry\nat the sort of scrapes Laura and you get into, because you would not\nwillingly and deliberately do wrong. If any children commit a mean\naction, or get into a passion, or quarrel with each other, or omit\nsaying their prayers and reading their Bibles, or tell a lie, or take\nwhat does not belong to them, then it might be seen how extremely angry\nI could be; but while you continue merely thoughtless and forgetful, I\nmean to have patience a little longer before turning into a cross old\nuncle with a pair of tawse.\"\n\nHarry sprung upon uncle David's knee, quite delighted to hear him speak\nso very kindly, and Laura was soon installed in her usual place there\nalso, listening to all that was said, and laughing at his jokes.\n\n\"As Mrs. Crabtree says,\" continued Major Graham, \"'we cannot put an old\nhead on young shoulders;' and it would certainly look very odd if you\ncould.\"\n\nSo uncle David took out his pencil, and drew a funny picture of a cross\nold wrinkled face upon young shoulders, like Laura's, and after they had\nall laughed at it together for about five minutes, he sent the children\nboth to bed, quite merry and cheerful.\n\nA long time elapsed afterwards without anything going wrong; and it was\nquite pleasant to see such learning of lessons, such attention to rules,\nand such obedience to Mrs. Crabtree, as went on in the nursery during\nseveral weeks. At last, one day, when Lady Harriet and Major Graham were\npreparing to set off on a journey, and to pay a short visit at Holiday\nHouse, Laura and Harry observed a great deal of whispering and talking\nin a corner of the room, but they could not exactly discover what it was\nall about, till Major Graham said very earnestly, \"I think we might\nsurely take Laura with us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Lady Harriet, \"both the children have been invited, and\nare behaving wonderfully well of late, but Lord Rockville has such a\ndislike to noise, that I dare not venture to take more than one at a\ntime. Poor Laura has a very severe cough, so she may be recovered by\nchange of air. As for Harry, he is quite well, and therefore he can stay\nat home.\"\n\nNow, Harry thought it very hard that he was to be left at home, merely\nbecause he felt quite well, so he immediately wished to be very ill\nindeed, that he might have some chance of going to Holiday House; but\nthen he did not exactly know how to set about it. At all events, Harry\ndetermined to catch a cold like Laura's, without delay. He would not,\nfor the whole world have pretended to suffer from a cough if he really\nhad none, because uncle David had often explained that making any one\nbelieve an un-truth was the same as telling a lie; but he thought there\nmight be no harm in really getting such a terrible cold, that nothing\ncould possibly cure it except change of air, and a trip to Holiday\nHouse with Laura. Accordingly Harry tried to remember every thing that\nMrs. Crabtree had forbid him to do \"for fear of catching cold.\" He\nsprinkled water over his shirt collar in the morning before dressing,\nthat it might be damp; he ran violently up and down stairs to put\nhimself in a heat, after which he sat between the open window and door\ntill he felt perfectly chilled; and when going to bed at night, he\nwashed his hair in cold water without drying it. Still, all was in vain!\nHarry had formerly caught cold a hundred times when he did not want one;\nbut now, such a thing was not to be had for love or money. Nothing\nseemed to give him the very slightest attempt at a cough; and when the\nday at last arrived for Lady Harriet to begin her journey, Harry still\nfelt himself most provokingly well. Not so much as a finger ached, his\ncheeks were as blooming as roses, his voice as clear as a bell, and when\nuncle David accidentally said to him in the morning, \"How do you do?\"\nHarry was obliged, very much against his will, to answer, \"Quite well, I\nthank you!\"\n\nIn the meantime, Laura would have felt too happy if Harry could only\nhave gone with her; and even as it was, being impatient for the happy\nday to arrive, she hurried to bed an hour earlier than usual the night\nbefore, to make the time of setting out appear nearer; and she could\nscarcely sleep or eat for thinking of Holiday House, and planning all\nthat was to be done there.\n\n\"It is pleasant to see so joyous a face,\" said Major Graham. \"I almost\nenvy you, Laura, for being so happy.\"\n\n\"Oh! I quite envy myself! but I shall write a long letter every day to\npoor Harry, telling him all the news, and all my adventures.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Miss Laura! wait till you come home,\" said Mrs. Crabtree.\n\"Who do you think is going to pay postage for so many foolish letters?\"\n\n\"I shall!\" answered Harry. \"I have got sixpence, and two pence, and a\nhalf penny, so I shall buy every one of Laura's letters from the\npostman, and write her an answer immediately afterwards. She will like\nto hear, Mrs. Crabtree, how very kind you are going to be, when I am\nleft by myself here. Perhaps you will play at nine pins with me, and\nLaura can lend you her skipping rope.\"\n\n\"You might as well offer uncle David a hobby-horse,\" said Frank,\nlaughingly, throwing his satchel over his shoulders. \"No, Harry! you\nshall belong to me now. Grandmama says you may go every day to my\nplay-ground, where all the school-boys assemble, and you can have plenty\nof fun till Laura comes back. We shall jump over the moon every morning,\nfor joy.\"\n\nHarry brightened up amazingly, thinking he had never heard such good\nnews before, as it was a grand piece of promotion to play with real big\nschool-boys; so he became quite reconciled to Laura's going away for a\nshort time without him; and when the hour came for taking leave, instead\nof tears being shed on either side, it would have been difficult to say,\nas they kissed each other and said a joyous good-bye, which face looked\nthe most delighted.\n\nAll Laura's clothes had been packed the night before, in a large chaise\nseat, which was now put into the carriage along with herself, and every\nthing seemed ready for departure, when Lady Harriet's maid was suddenly\ntaken so very ill, as to be quite unfit for travelling; therefore she\nwas left behind, and a doctor sent for to attend her; while Lady Harriet\nsaid she would trust to the maids at Holiday House, for waiting upon\nherself and Laura.\n\nIt is seldom that so happy a face is seen in this world, as Laura wore\nduring the whole journey. It perfectly sparkled and glittered with\ndelight, while she was so constantly on a broad grin laughing, that\nMajor Graham said he feared her mouth would grow an inch wider on the\noccasion.\n\n\"You will tire of sitting so long idle! It is a pity we did not think of\nbringing a few lesson-books in the carriage to amuse you, Laura,\" said\nthe Major, slyly. \"A piece of needle-work might have beguiled the way. I\nonce knew an industrious lady who made a ball dress for herself in the\ncarriage during a journey.\"\n\n\"How very stupid of her to miss seeing all the pretty trees, and\ncottages, and farm-houses! I do like to watch the little curly-headed,\ndirty children, playing on the road, with brown faces, and hair bleached\nwhite in the sun; and the women hanging out their clothes on the hedges\nto dry; and the blacksmith shoeing horses, and the ducks swimming in the\ngutters, and the pigs thrusting their noses out of the sty, and the old\nwomen knitting stockings, and the workmen sitting on a wall to eat their\ndinners! It looks all so pretty, and so pleasant!\"\n\n\"What a picture of rural felicity! You ought to be a poet or a painter,\nLaura!\"\n\n\"But I believe poets always call this a miserable world: and I think it\nthe happiest place I have ever been in, uncle David! Such fun during the\nholidays! I should go wild altogether, if Mrs. Crabtree were not rather\ncross sometimes.\"\n\n\"Or very cross always,\" thought Major Graham. \"But here we are, Laura,\nnear our journey's end. Allow me to introduce you to Holiday House! Why,\nyou are staring at it like a dog looking at a piece of cold beef! My\ndear girl, if you open your eyes so wide, you will never be able to shut\nthem again!\"\n\nHoliday House was not one of those prodigious places, too grand to be\npleasant, with the garden a mile off in one direction, and the farm a\nmile off in another, and the drawing-room a mile off from the\ndining-room; but it was a very cheerful modern mansion, with rooms\nenough to hold as many people as any one could desire to see at once,\nall very comfortably furnished. A lively, dashing river, streamed past\nthe windows; a small park, sprinkled with sheep, and shaded by fine\ntrees, surrounded the house; and beyond were beautiful gardens filled\nwith a superabundance of the gayest and sweetest common flowers. Roses,\ncarnations, wall flowers, holly-hocks, dahlias, lilies, and violets,\nwere assembled there in such crowds, that Laura might have plucked\nnosegays all day, without making any visible difference; and she was\nalso made free of the gooseberry bushes and cherry-trees, with leave to\ngather, if she pleased, more than she could eat.\n\nEvery morning, Laura entered the breakfast-room with cheeks like the\nroses she carried, bringing little bouquets for all the ladies, which\nshe had started out of bed early, in order to gather; and her great\ndelight was to see them worn and admired all the forenoon, while she was\ncomplimented on the taste with which they had been selected and\narranged. She filled every ornamental jar, basin, and tea-cup in the\ndrawing-room, with groups of roses, and would have been the terror of\nany gardener but the one at Holiday House, who liked to see his flowers\nso much admired, and was not keeping up any for a horticultural show.\n\nLaura's chief delight, however, was in the dairy, which seemed the most\nbeautiful thing she had ever beheld, being built of rough transparent\nspar, which looked exactly like crystal, and reminded her of the ice\npalace built by the Empress of Russia. The windows were of painted\nglass; the walls and shelves were of Dutch tiles, and in the centre rose\na beautiful jet d'eau of clear bright water.\n\nLaura thought it looked like something built for the fairies; but within\nshe saw a most substantial room, the floor and tables in which were so\ncompletely covered with cheeses, that they looked like some old Mosaic\npavement. Here the good-natured dairy-maid showed Laura how to make\ncheese, and afterwards manufactured a very small one about the size of a\nsoup plate, entirely for the young lady herself, which she promised to\ntake home after her visit was over; and a little churn was also filled\nfull of cream, which Laura one morning churned into butter, and\nbreakfasted upon, after having first practised printing it into a\nvariety of shapes. It was altered about twenty times from a swan into a\ncow, and from a cow into a rose, and from a rose back to a swan again,\nbefore she could be persuaded to leave off her amusement.\n\nLaura continued to become more and more delighted with Holiday House;\nand she one day skipped about Lady Harriet's room, saying, \"Oh! I am too\nhappy! I scarcely know what to do with so much happiness. How delightful\nit would be to stay here all my life, and never to go to bed, nor say\nany more lessons as long as I live!\"\n\n\"What a useless, stupid girl you would soon become,\" observed Lady\nHarriet. \"Do you think, Laura, that lessons were invented for no other\npurpose but to torment little children?\"\n\n\"No, grandmama; not exactly! They are of use also to keep us quiet.\"\n\n\"Come here, little madam, and listen to me. I shall soon be very old,\nLaura, and not able to read my Bible, even with spectacles; for, as the\nScriptures told us, in that affecting description of old age, which I\nread to you yesterday, 'the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the\ngrinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the\nwindows be darkened:' what then do you think I can do, because the Bible\nnow is my best comfort, which I shall need more and more every day, to\ntell me all about the eternal world where I am going, and to shew me the\nway.\"\n\n\"Grandmama! you promised long ago to let me attend on you when you grow\nold and blind! I shall be very careful, and very--very--very kind. I\nalmost wish you were old and blind now, to let you feel how much I love\nyou, and how anxious I am to be as good to you as you have always been\nto me. We shall read the Bible together every morning, and as often\nafterwards as you please.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear child! but you must take the trouble of learning to\nread well, or we shall be sadly puzzled with the difficult words. A\nfriend of mine once had nobody that could read to her when she was ill,\nbut the maid, who bargained that she might leave out every word above\none syllable long, because they were too hard for her; and you could\nhardly help laughing at the nonsense it sometimes made; but I hope you\nwill manage better.\"\n\n\"O certainly, grandmama! I can spell chrononhotonthologos, and all the\nother five-cornered words in my 'Reading Made Easy,' already.\"\n\n\"Besides that, my dear Laura! unless you learn to look over my bills, I\nmay be sadly cheated by servants and shop-keepers. You must positively\nstudy to find out how many cherries make five.\"\n\n\"Ah! grandmama! nobody knows better than I do, that two and two make\nfour. I shall soon be quite able to keep your accounts.\"\n\n\"Very well! but you have not yet heard half the trouble I mean to give\nyou. I am remarkably fond of music, and shall probably at last be\nobliged to hire every old fiddler as he passes in the street, by giving\nhim sixpence in order to enjoy some of my favourite tunes.\"\n\n\"No, grandmama! you shall hear them all from me. I can play Malbrook,\nand Auld Robin Grey, already; and Frank says if I practise two hours\nevery day for ten years, I shall become a very tolerable player, fit for\nyou and uncle David to hear, without being disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Then that will be more than seven thousand hours of musical lessons\nwhich you have yet to endure, Laura! There are many more things of\nstill greater importance to learn also, if you wish to be any better\nthan a musical snuff-box. For instance, when visitors come to see me,\nthey are often from France or Italy; but perhaps you will not mind\nsitting in the room as if you were deaf and dumb, gazing at those\nforeigners, while they gaze at you, without understanding a syllable\nthey say, and causing them to feel strange and uncomfortable as long as\nthey remain in the house.\"\n\n\"No! I would not for the world seem so unkind and uncivil. Pray, let me\nlearn plenty of languages.\"\n\n\"Very well! but if you study no geography, what ridiculous blunders you\nwill be falling into! asking the Italians about their native town\nMadrid, and the Americans if they were born at Petersburgh. You will be\nfancying that travellers go by steam-boats to Moscow, and travel in a\nday from Paris, through Stockholm to Naples. How ashamed I should be of\nsuch mistakes!\"\n\n\"And so should I, grandmama, still more than you; for it would be quite\na disgrace.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, Laura, your uncle David laughing, when he last went to\nlive at Leamington, about poor Mrs. Marmalade coming up stairs to say,\nshe did not wish to be troublesome, but should feel greatly obliged if\nhe would call at Portsmouth occasionally to see her son Thomas. And when\nCaptain Armylist's regiment was ordered last winter to the village of\nBathgate near this, he told me they were to march in the course of that\nmorning, all the way to Bagdad.\"\n\n\"Yes, grandmama! and Mrs. Crabtree said some weeks ago, that if her\nbrother went to Van Dieman's Land, she thought he would of course in\npassing, take a look at Jerusalem; and Frank was amused lately to hear\nPeter Grey maintain, that Gulliver was as great a man as Columbus,\nbecause he discovered Liliput!\"\n\n\"Quite like him! for I heard Peter ask one day lately, what side\nBonaparte was on at the battle of Leipsic? We must include a little\nhistory I think, Laura, in our list of studies, or you will fancy that\nLord Nelson fought at the battle of Blenheim, and that Henry VIII. cut\noff Queen Mary's head.\"\n\n\"Not quite so bad as that, grandmama! I seem to have known all about\nLord Nelson and Queen Mary, ever since I was a baby in long frocks! You\nhave shewn me, however, that it would be very foolish not to feel\nanxious for lessons, especially when they are to make me a fit companion\nfor you at last.\"\n\n\"Yes, Laura! and not only for me, but for many whose conversation will\nentertain and improve you more than any books. The most delightful\naccomplishment that a young person can cultivate, is that of conversing\nagreeably; and it is less attended to in education than any other. You\ncannot take a harp or piano about with you, but our minds and tongues\nare always portable, and accompany us wherever we go. If you wish to be\nloved by others, and to do good to your associates, as well as to\nentertain them, take every opportunity of conversing with those who are\neither amiable or agreeable; not only attending to their opinions, but\nalso endeavouring to gain the habit of expressing your own thoughts with\nease and fluency; and then rest assured, that if the gift of\nconversation be rightly exercised, it is the most desirable of all, as\nno teaching can have greater influence in leading people to think and\nact aright, than the incidental remarks of an enlightened Christian,\nfreely and unaffectedly talking to his intimate friends.\"\n\n\"Well, grandmama! the moral of all this is, that I shall become busier\nthan any body ever was before, when we get home; but in the meantime, I\nmay take a good dose of idleness now at Holiday House, to prepare me for\nsettling to very hard labour afterwards,\" said Laura, hastily tying on\nher bonnet. \"I wonder if I shall ever be as merry and happy again!\"\n\nMost unfortunately, all the time of Laura's visit at Holiday House, she\nhad been, as usual, extremely heedless, in taking no care whatever of\nher clothes; consequently her blue merino frock had been cruelly torn;\nher green silk dress became frightfully soiled; four white frocks were\nutterly ruined; her Swiss muslin seemed a perfect object, and her pink\ngingham was both torn and discoloured. Regularly every evening Lady\nHarriet told her to take better care, or she would be a bankrupt in\nfrocks altogether; but whatever her grandmama said on that subject, the\nmoment she was out of sight, it went out of mind, till another dress had\nshared the same deplorable fate.\n\nAt last, one morning, as soon as Laura got up, Lady Harriet gravely led\nher towards a large table on which all the ill-used frocks had been laid\nout in a row; and a most dismal sight they were! Such a collection of\nstains and fractures was probably never seen before! A beggar would\nscarcely have thanked her for her blue merino; and the green silk frock\nlooked like the tattered cover of a worn-out umbrella.\n\n\"Laura,\" said Lady Harriet, \"in Switzerland a lady's wardrobe descends\nto many generations; but nobody will envy your successor! One might\nfancy that a wild beast had torn you to pieces every day! I wonder what\nan old clothesman would give for your whole baggage! It is only fit for\nbeing used as rags in a paper manufactory!\"\n\nPoor Laura's face became perfectly pink when she saw the destruction\nthat a very short time had occasioned: and she looked from one tattered\ngarment to another, in melancholy silence, thinking how lately they had\nall been fresh and beautiful; but now not a vestige of their former\nsplendour remained. At last her grandmama broke the awful silence, by\nsaying,\n\n\"My dear girl! I have warned you very often lately that we are not at\nhome, where your frocks could be washed and mended as soon as they were\nspoiled; but without considering this you have, every day, destroyed\nseveral, so now the maid finds, on examining your drawers, that there is\nonly one clean frock remaining!\"\n\nLaura looked gravely at the last clean frock, and wondered much what her\ngrandmama would say next.\n\n\"I do not wish to make a prisoner of you at home during this very fine\nweather, yet in five minutes after leaving the house, you will, of\ncourse, become unfit to be seen, which I should very much regret, as a\nnumber of fine people are coming to dinner, whom you would like to see.\nThe great General Courteney, and all his Aide-de-Camps, intend to be\nhere on their way from a review, besides many officers and ladies who\nknow your papa very well, and wish to see my little grand-daughter; but\nI would not on any account allow you to appear before them, looking like\na perfect tatterdemalion, as you too often do. They would suppose you\nhad been drawn backwards through a hedge! Now my plan is, that you shall\nwear this old pink gingham for romping all morning in the garden, and\ndress in your last clean frock for dinner; but remember to keep out of\nsight till then. Remain within the garden walls, as none of the company\nwill be walking there, but be sure to avoid the terrace and shrubberies\ntill you are made tidy, for I shall be both angry and mortified if your\npapa's friends see you for the first time looking like rag-fair.\"\n\nLaura promised to remember her grandmama's injunctions, and to remain\ninvisible all morning; so off she set to the garden, singing and\nskipping with joy, as she ran towards her pleasant hiding-place,\nplanning twenty ways in which the day might be delightfully spent alone.\nBefore long she had strung a long necklace of daisies--she had put many\nbright leaves in a book to dry--she had made a large ball of cowslips\nto toss in the air--she had watered the hyacinths, with a watering-pot,\ntill they were nearly washed away--she had plucked more roses than could\npossibly be carried, and eat as many gooseberries and cherries as it was\nconvenient to swallow,--but still there were several hours remaining to\nbe enjoyed, and nothing very particular, that Laura could think of, to\ndo.\n\nMeantime, the miserable pink frock was torn worse than ever, and seemed\nto be made of nothing but holes, for every gooseberry-bush in the garden\nhad got a share of it. Laura wished pink gingham frocks had never been\ninvented, and wondered why nothing stronger could be made! Having become\nperfectly tired of the garden, she now wished herself anywhere else in\nthe world, and thought she was no better off, confined in this way\nwithin four walls, than a canary bird in a cage.\n\n\"I should like so much to go, if it were only for five minutes, on the\nterrace!\" said she to herself. \"How much pleasanter it is than this.\nGrandmama did not care where I went, provided nobody saw me! I may at\nleast take a peep to see if any one is there!\"\n\nLaura now cautiously opened the garden-door, and put her head out,\nintending only to look for a moment, but the moment grew longer and\nlonger, till it stretched into ten minutes.\n\n\"What crowds of fine people are walking about on the terrace!\" thought\nshe. \"It looks as gay as a fair! Who can that officer be in a red coat,\nand cocked hat with white feathers. Probably General Courteney paying\nattention to Lady Rockville. There is a lady in a blue cloak and blue\nflowers! how very pretty! Everybody is so exceedingly smart! and I see\nsome little boys too! Grandmama never told me any children were coming!\nI wonder how old they are, and if they will play with me in the evening!\nIt would be very amusing to venture a little nearer, and get a better\nglimpse of them all!\"\n\nIf Laura's wishes pointed one way and her duty pointed the other, it was\na very sad thing how often she forgot to pause and consider which she\nought to follow; and on this occasion, as usual, she took the naughty\nside of the question, and prepared to indulge her curiosity, though very\nanxious that nothing might happen to displease her grandmama. She\nobserved at some distance on the terrace, a remarkably large thick\nholly-bush, near which the great procession of company would probably\npass before long, therefore, hoping nobody could possibly see her there,\nshe stole hastily out of the garden, and concealed herself behind it;\nbut when children do wrong, in hopes of not being found out, they\ngenerally find themselves mistaken, as Laura soon discovered to her\ncost. It is very lucky, however, for the culprits, when they are\ndetected, that they may learn never to behave so foolishly again,\nbecause the greatest misfortune that can happen to a child is, not to be\nfound out and punished when he does wrong.\n\nA few minutes after Laura had taken her station behind the holly-bush,\ncrowds of ladies and officers came strolling along, so very near her\nhiding-place, that she saw them all distinctly, and felt excessively\namused and delighted at first, to be perched like a bird in a tree\nwatching this grand party, while nobody saw her, nor guessed that she\nwas there. Presently, however, Laura became sadly frightened when an\nofficer in a scarlet coat happened to look towards the holly-bush, and\nexclaimed, with some surprise,\n\n\"There is surely something very odd about that plant! I see large pink\nspots between the leaves!\"\n\n\"Oh no, Captain Digby, you are quite mistaken,\" answered one of the\nladies, dressed in a bright yellow bonnet and green pelisse. \"I see\nnothing particular there! only a common ugly bush of holly! I wonder you\never thought of noticing it!\"\n\n\"But, Miss Perceval! there certainly is something very curious behind!\nI would bet five to one there is!\" replied Captain Digby, stepping up,\nclose to the holly-bush, and peeping over: \"What have we here! a ragged\nlittle girl, I do believe! in a pink frock!\"\n\nPoor Laura was now in a terrible scrape; she started up immediately to\nrun away. Probably she never ran so fast in her life before, but Captain\nDigby was a person who enjoyed a joke, so he called out\n\n    \"Tally-ho! a race for a thousand pounds!\"\n\nOff set the Captain, and away flew Laura. At any other time she would\nhave thought it capital fun, but now she was frightened out of her wits,\nand tore away at the very top of her speed. The whole party of ladies\nand gentlemen stood laughing, and applauding, to see how fast they both\ncleared the ground, while Laura, seeing the garden gate still wide open,\nhoped she might be able to dart in, and close it, but alas! when she\narrived within four steps of the threshold, feeling almost certain of\nescape, Captain Digby seized hold of her pink frock behind. It instantly\nbegan tearing, so she had great hopes of leaving the piece in his hand\nand getting off; but he was too clever for that, as he grasped hold of\nher long sash, which was floating far out behind, and led Laura a\nprisoner before the whole company.\n\nWhen Lady Harriet discovered that this was really Laura advancing, her\nhead hanging down, her hair streaming about her ears, and her face like\na full moon, she could scarcely credit her own eyes, and held her hands\nup with astonishment, while uncle David shrugged his shoulders, till\nthey almost met over his head, but not a word was said on either side\nuntil they got home, when Lady Harriet at last broke the awful silence\nby saying,\n\n\"My dear girl! you must, of course, be severely punished for this act of\ndisobedience, and it is not so much on account of feeling angry at your\nmisconduct that I mean to correct you, but because I love you, and wish\nto make you behave better in future. Parents are appointed by God to\ngovern their children as he governs us, not carelessly indulging their\nfaults, but wisely correcting them, for we are told that our Great\nFather in heaven chastens those whom he loves, and only afflicts us for\ngreat and wise purposes. I have suffered many sorrows in the world, but\nthey always made me better in the end, and whatever discipline you meet\nwith from me, or from that Great Being who loves you still more than I\ndo, let it teach you to consider your ways, to repent of your\nwilfulness, and to pray that you may be enabled to act more properly in\nfuture.\"\n\n\"Yes, grandmama,\" replied Laura, with tears in her eyes, \"I am quite\nwilling to be punished, for it was very wrong indeed to make you so\nvexed and ashamed, by disobeying your orders.\"\n\n\"Then here is a long task which you must study before dinner, as a\npenalty for trespassing bounds. It is a beautiful poem on the death of\nSir John Moore, which every school-girl can repeat, but being rather\nlong, you will scarcely have time to learn it perfectly, before coming\ndown to dessert, therefore, that you may be quite ready, I shall ring\nnow for Lady Rockville's maid, and have you washed and dressed\nimmediately. Remember this is your last clean frock, and be sure not to\nspoil it.\"\n\nWhen Laura chose to pay attention, she could learn her lessons\nwonderfully fast, and her eyes seemed nailed to the book for some time\nafter Lady Harriet went away, till at last she could repeat the whole\npoem perfectly well. It was neither \"slowly nor sadly\" that Laura \"laid\ndown\" her book, after practising it all, in a sort of jig time, till she\ncould rattle over the poem like a rail-road, and she walked to the\nwindow, still murmuring the verses to herself with prodigious glee, and\ngiving little thought to their melancholy subject.\n\nA variety of plans suggested themselves to her mind for amusing herself\nwithin doors, as she had been forbidden to venture out, and she lost no\ntime in executing them. First, she tried on all her grandmama's caps at\na looking-glass, none of which were improved by being crushed and\ntumbled in such a way. Then she quarrelled with Lady Rockville's\nbeautiful cockatoo, till it bit her finger violently, and after that,\nshe teazed the old cat till it scratched her; but all these diversions\nwere not sufficiently entertaining, so Laura began to grow rather tired,\ntill at last she went to gaze out at the portico of Holiday House, being\nperfectly determined, on no account whatever, to go one single step\nfarther.\n\nHere Laura saw many things which entertained her extremely, for she had\nscarcely ever seen more of the country than was to be enjoyed with Mrs.\nCrabtree in Charlotte Square. The punctual crows were all returning home\nat their usual hour for the evening, and looked like a black shower over\nher head, while hundreds of them seemed trying to make a concert at\nonce; the robins hopped close to her feet, evidently accustomed to be\nfed; a tame pheasant, as fat as a London alderman, came up the steps to\nkeep her company; and the peacock, spreading his tail, and strutting\nabout, looked the very picture of silly pride and vanity.\n\nLaura admired and enjoyed all this extremely, and crumbled down nearly a\nloaf of bread, which she scattered on the ground, in order to be popular\namong her visitors, who took all they could get from her, and quarrelled\namong themselves about it, very much as boys and girls would perhaps\nhave done in the same circumstances.\n\nIt happened at this moment, that a large flock of geese crossed the\npark, on their way towards the river, stalking along in a slow majestic\nmanner, with their heads high in the air. Laura observed them at a\ndistance, and thought they were the prettiest creatures in the world,\nwith their pure white feathers and yellow stockings, so she wondered\nwhat kind of birds these were, having never seen a goose before, except\nwhen roasted for dinner, though, indeed, she was a sad goose herself, as\nwill very soon be told.\n\n\"How I should like to examine those large, white, beautiful birds, a\nlittle nearer,\" thought Laura to herself. \"I wonder if they could swim\nor fly!--oh! how perfect they would look, floating like water-lilies on\nthe river, and then I might take a bit of bread to throw in, and they\nwould all rush after it!\"\n\nLaura, as usual, did not wait to reflect what her grandmama might be\nlikely to think; indeed it is to be feared Laura forgot at the moment\nthat she had a grandmama at all, for her mind was never large enough to\nhold more than one thing at a time, and now it was entirely filled with\nthe flock of geese. She instantly set off in pursuit of them, and began\nchasing the whole party across the park, making all sorts of dreadful\nnoises, in hopes they might fly; but, on the contrary, they held up\ntheir heads, as if she had been a dancing-master, and marched slowly on,\ncackling loudly to each other, and evidently getting extremely angry.\n\nLaura was now quite close to her new acquaintances, and even threw a\npebble to hurry them forward, when suddenly an old gander stopped, and\nturned round in a terrible rage. The whole flock of geese then did the\nsame, after which they flew towards Laura, with their bills wide open,\nhissing furiously, and stretching out their long necks in an angry\nmenacing way, as if they wished to tear her in pieces.\n\nPoor Laura became frightened out of any wits she ever had, and ran off,\nwith all the geese after her! Anybody must have laughed into fits, could\nthey have heard what a triumphant cackle the geese set up, and had they\nseen how fast she flew away. If Laura had borrowed a pair of wings from\nher pursuers, she could scarcely have got more quickly on.\n\nIn the hurry of escaping, she always looked back to see if the enemy\nfollowed, and scarcely observed which way she ran herself, till suddenly\nher foot stumbled over a large stone, and she fell headlong into the\nriver!--oh, what a scream Laura gave! it terrified even the old gander\nhimself, and sent the whole flock of geese marching off, nearly as fast\nas they had come; but Laura's cries also reached, at a great distance,\nthe ears of somebody, who she would have been very sorry to think had\nheard them.\n\nLady Harriet, and all her friends at Holiday House, were taking a\ndelightful walk under some fine old fir trees, on the banks of the\nriver, admiring the beautiful scenery, while Miss Perceval was admiring\nnothing but her own fine pocket handkerchief, which had cost ten\nguineas, being worked with her name, trimmed with lace, and perfumed\nwith eau de Cologne; and Captain Digby was admiring his own scarlet\nuniform, reflected in the bright clear water, and varying his employment\noccasionally by throwing pebbles into the stream, to see how far they\nwould go. Suddenly, however, he stopped, with a look of surprise and\nalarm, saying, \"What noise can that be!--a loud scream in the water!\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no! it was only one of those horrid peacocks,\" answered Miss\nPerceval, waving her fine pocket handkerchief. \"They are the most\ndisagreeable, noisy creatures in the world! If mama ever keeps one, I\nshall get him a singing-master, or put a muzzle on his mouth!\"\n\n\"But surely there is something splashing in the river at a great\ndistance. Do you not see that!--what can it be?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, depend upon it! I could bet the value of my pocket\nhandkerchief, ten guineas, that it is nothing. Officers who live\nconstantly in barracks are so unaccustomed to the country, that they\nseem to expect something wonderful shall happen every minute! That is\nprobably a salmon or a minnow.\"\n\n\"I am determined, however, to see. If you are quite sure this is a\nsalmon, will you promise to eat for your dinner whatever we find,\nprovided I can catch it?\"\n\n\"Certainly! unless you catch a whale! Oh! I have dropped my pocket\nhandkerchief,--pray pick it up!\"\n\nCaptain Digby did so; but without waiting to examine the pattern, he\ninstantly ran forward, and to his own very great astonishment, saw Laura\nup to her knees in the river, trying to scramble out, while her face was\nwhite with terror, and her limbs trembled with cold, like a poodle dog\nnewly washed.\n\n\"Why, here you are again!--the very same little girl that I caught in\nthe morning,\" cried he, laughing heartily, while he carefully pulled\nLaura towards the bank, though, by doing so, he splashed his beautiful\nuniform most distressingly. \"We have had a complete game at bo-peep\nto-day, my friend! but here comes a lady who has promised to eat you up,\ntherefore I shall have no more trouble.\"\n\nLaura would have consented to be eaten up with pleasure, rather than\nencounter Lady Harriet's eye, who really did not recognize her for the\nfirst minute, as no one can suppose what a figure she appeared. The last\nclean frock had been covered entirely over with mud--her hair was\ndripping with water--and her new yellow sash might be any colour in the\nworld. Laura felt so completely ashamed she could not look up from the\nground, and so sorry she could not speak, while hot tears mingled\nthemselves with the cold water which trickled down her face.\n\n\"What is the matter! Who is this?\" cried Lady Harriet, hurrying up to\nthe place where they stood. \"Laura!! Impossible!!!\"\n\n\"Let me put on a pair of spectacles, for I cannot believe my eyes\nwithout them!\" said Major Graham. \"Ah! sure enough it is Laura, and\nsuch a looking Laura as I never saw before. You must have had a nice\ncold bath!\"\n\n\"I have heard,\" continued Lady Harriet, \"that naughty people are often\nducked in the water as a punishment, and in that respect I am sure Laura\ndeserves what she has got, and a great deal more.\"\n\n\"She reminds me,\" observed Captain Digby, \"of the Chinese bird which has\nno legs, so it constantly flies about from place to place, never a\nmoment at rest.\"\n\n\"Follow me, Laura,\" said Lady Harriet, \"that I may hear whether you have\nanything to say for yourself on this occasion. It is scarcely possible\nthat there can be any excuse, but nobody should be condemned unheard.\"\n\nWhen Laura had been put into dry clothes, she told her whole history,\nand entreated Lady Harriet to hear how very perfectly she had first\nlearned her task, before venturing to stir out of the room; upon which\nher grandmama consented, and amidst tears and sobs, the monody on Sir\nJohn Moore was repeated without a single mistake. Lady Rockville then\ncame in, to entreat that, as this was the last day of the visit to\nHoliday House, Laura might be forgiven and permitted to appear at\ndessert, as all the company were anxious to see her, and particularly\nCaptain Digby, who regretted that he had been the means at first of\ngetting her into a scrape.\n\n\"Indeed, my dear Lady Rockville! I might perhaps have agreed to your\nwishes,\" answered Lady Harriet, \"particularly as Laura seems sincerely\nsorry, and did not premeditate her disobedience; but she actually has\nnot a tolerable frock to appear in now!\"\n\n\"I must lend her one of my velvet dresses to destroy next,\" said Lady\nRockville, smiling.\n\n\"Uncle David's Mackintosh cloak would be the fittest thing for her to\nwear,\" replied Lady Harriet, rising to leave the room. \"Laura, you must\nlearn a double task now! Here it is! and at Lady Rockville's request I\nexcuse you this once; though I am sorry that, for very sufficient\nreasons, we cannot see you at dessert, which otherwise I should have\nbeen most happy to do.\"\n\nLaura sat down and cried during a quarter of an hour after Lady Harriet\nhad gone to dinner. She felt sorry for having behaved ill, and sorry to\nhave vexed her good grandmama; and sorry not to see all the fine party\nat dessert; and sorry to think that next day she must leave Holiday\nHouse; and sorry, last of all, to consider what Mrs. Crabtree would say\nwhen all her ruined frocks were brought home. In short, poor Laura felt\nperfectly overwhelmed with the greatness and variety of her griefs, and\nscarcely believed that any one in the world was ever more miserable than\nherself.\n\nHer eyes were fixed on her task, while her thoughts were wandering fifty\nmiles away from it, when a housemaid, who had frequently attended upon\nLaura during her visit, accidentally entered the room, and seemed much\nsurprised, as well as concerned, to find the young lady in such a way,\nfor her sobbing could be heard in the next room. It was quite a relief\nto see any one; so Laura told over again all the sad adventures of the\nday, without attempting to conceal how naughty she had been; and most\nattentively was her narrative listened to, till the very end.\n\n\"You see, Miss!\" observed Nelly, \"when people doesn't behave well, they\nmust expect to be punished.\"\n\n\"So they should!\" sobbed Laura; \"and I dare say it will make me better!\nI would not pass such a miserable day as this again, for the world; but\nI deserve to be more punished than I am.\"\n\n\"That's right, Miss!\" replied Nelly, pleased to see the good effect of\nher admonitions. \"Punishment is as sure to do us good when we are\nnaughty, as physic when we are ill. But now you'll go down to dessert,\nand forget it all.\"\n\n\"No! grandmama would have allowed me, and Lady Rockville and every body\nwas so very kind about inviting me down; but my last clean frock is\nquite unfit to be seen, so I have none to put on. Oh, dear! what a\nthousand million of pities!\"\n\n\"Is that all, Miss! Then dry your eyes, and I can wash the frock in ten\nminutes. Give it to me, and learn your lesson, so as to be ready when I\ncome back.\"\n\nLaura sprung off her seat with joy at this proposal, and ran--or rather\nflew--to fetch her miserable object of a frock, which Nelly crumpled\nunder her arm, and walked away with, in such haste that she was\nevidently determined to return very soon; while Laura took her good\nadvice, and sat down to learn her task, though she could hardly look at\nthe book during two minutes at a time--she watched so impatiently for\nher benefactress from the laundry.\n\nAt length the door flew open, and in walked Nelly, whose face looked as\nred and hot as a beefsteak; but in her hand she carried a basket, on\nwhich was laid out, in great state, the very cleanest frock that ever\nwas seen! It perfectly smelled of soap and water, starch and hot irons,\nand seemed still almost smoking from the laundry; while Laura looked at\nit with such delight and admiration, it might have been supposed she\nnever saw a clean frock before.\n\nWhen Lady Harriet was sitting after dinner that day, sipping her wine,\nand thinking about no thing very particular, she became surprised to\nfeel somebody gently twitching her sleeve to attract notice. Turning\ninstantly round to ascertain what was the matter, and who it could be,\nwhat was her astonishment to see Laura at her elbow, looking rather shy\nand frightened.\n\n\"How did you get here, child!\" exclaimed Lady Harriet, in accents of\namazement, though almost laughing. \"Am I never to see the last of you\nto-day! Where did you get that frock! It must have dropped from the\nclouds! Or did some good fairy give you a new one?\"\n\n\"That good fairy was Nelly the housemaid,\" whispered Laura. \"She first\ntossed my frock into a washing-tub; and then at the great kitchen fire\nshe toasted it, and----\"\n\n\"----And buttered it, I hope,\" added Major Graham. \"Come here, Laura! I\ncan read what is written in your grandmama's face at this moment; and it\nsays, 'you are a tiresome little puss, that nobody can keep in any order\nexcept uncle David;' therefore sit down beside him, and eat as many\nalmonds and raisins as he bids you.\"\n\n\"You are a nice, funny uncle David!\" whispered Laura, crushing her way\nin between his chair and Miss Perceval's, \"nobody will need a tongue\nnow, if you can read so exactly what we are all thinking.\"\n\n\"But here is Miss Perceval, still more wonderful; for she knows by the\nbumps on your head, all that is contained inside. Let me see if I could\ndo so! There is a large bump of reading, and a small one of writing and\narithmetic. Here is a terrible organ of breaking dolls and destroying\nfrocks. There is a very small bump of liking uncle David, and a\nprodigious one of liking almonds and raisins!\"\n\n\"No! you are quite mistaken! It is the largest bump for loving uncle\nDavid, and the small one for every thing else,\" interrupted Laura,\neagerly. \"I shall draw a map of my head some day, to show you how it is\nall divided.\"\n\n\"And leave no room for any thing naughty or foolish! Your head should be\nswept out, and put in order every morning, that not a single cobweb may\nremain in your brains. What busy brains they must be for the next ten\nyears! But in the meantime let us hope that you will never again be\nreduced to your\n\n                              \"LAST CLEAN FROCK.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE LONG LADDER.\n\n  There was a young pickle, and what do you think?\n  He liv'd upon nothing but victuals and drink;\n  Victuals and drink were the chief of his diet,\n  And yet this young pickle could never be quiet.\n\n\nOne fine sultry day in the month of August, Harry and Laura stood at the\nbreakfast-room window, wondering to see the large broken white clouds,\nlooking like curds and whey, while the sun was in such a blaze of heat,\nthat every thing seemed almost red hot. The street door had become\nblistered by the sun-beams. Jowler the dog lay basking on the pavement;\nthe green blinds were closed at every opposite house; the few gentlemen\nwho ventured out, were fanning themselves with their pocket\nhandkerchiefs; the ladies were strolling lazily along, under the\numbrageous shade of their green parasols; and the poor people who were\naccustomed in winter to sell matches for lighting a fire, now carried\nabout gaudy paper hangings for the empty grates. Lady Harriet found the\nbutter so melted at breakfast, that she could scarcely lift it on her\nknife; and uncle David complained that the sight of hot smoking tea put\nhim in a fever, and said he wished it could be iced.\n\n\"I wonder how iced porridge would taste!\" said Harry. \"I put mine at the\nopen window to cool, but that only made it seem hotter. We were talking\nof the gentleman you mentioned yesterday, who toasted his muffins at a\nvolcano; and certainly yours might almost be done at the drawing-room\nwindow this morning.\"\n\n\"Wait till you arrive at the countries I have visited, where, as\nsomebody remarked, the very salamanders die of heat. At Agra, which is\nthe hottest part of India, we could scarcely write a letter, because the\nink dries in the pen before you can get it to the paper. I was obliged,\nwhen our regiment was there, to lie down in the middle of the day,\nduring several hours, actually gasping for breath; and to make up for\nthat, we all rose at midnight. An officer of ours, who lived long in\nIndia, got up always at three in the morning, after we returned home,\nand walked about the streets of Portsmouth, wondering what had become of\neverybody.\"\n\n\"I shall try not to grumble about weather any more,\" said Laura. \"We\nseem no worse off than other people.\"\n\n\"Or rather we are a great deal better off! At Bermuda, where my regiment\nstopped on the way to America, the inhabitants are so tormented with\nhigh winds, that they build 'hurricane houses'--low, flat rooms, where\nthe families must retire when a storm comes on, as trees, houses,\npeople, and cattle, are all whirled about with such violence, that not a\nlife is safe on the island while it lasts.\"\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Lady Harriet, \"of a droll mistake made yesterday\nby the African camel, when he landed at Leith. His keepers were leading\nhim along the high road to be made a show of in Edinburgh, at a time\nwhen the wind was particularly high; and the poor animal encountering\nsuch clouds of dust, thought this must be a simoon of the desert, and\nthrew himself flat down, burying his nose in the ground, according to\ncustom on those occasions. It was with great difficulty that he could at\nlast be induced to face the danger, and proceed.\"\n\n\"Quite a compliment to our dust,\" observed Laura. \"But really in such a\nhot day, the kangaroos and tigers might feel perfectly at home here.\nOh! how I should like to visit the GEOlogical Gardens in London!\"\n\n\"Then suppose we set off immediately!\" said Major Graham, pretending to\nrise from his chair. \"Your grandmama's donkey-carriage holds two.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you could carry the donkey-carriage more easily than it could\ncarry you!\"\n\n\"Shall I try? Well, if we go, who is to pay the turnpikes, for I\nremember the time, not a hundred years ago, when Harry and you both\nthought that paying the gates was the only expense of travelling. You\nasked me then how poor grandmama could afford so many shillings and\nsixpences.\"\n\n\"We know all about every thing now though!\" said Harry, nodding in a\nvery sagacious manner. \"I can tell exactly how much time it takes going\nby the public coach to London, and it sleeps only one night on the\nroad.\"\n\n\"Sleeps!\" cried uncle David. \"What! it puts on a night-cap, and goes to\nbed?\"\n\n\"Yes! and it dines and breakfasts too, Mr. uncle David, for I heard Mrs.\nCrabtree say so.\"\n\n\"Never name anybody, unless you wish to see her immediately,\" said Major\nGraham, hearing a well-known tap at the door. \"As sure as you mention an\nabsent person, if he is supposed to be fifty miles off at the time, it\nis rather odd, but he instantly appears!\"\n\n\"Then there is somebody that I shall speak about very often.\"\n\n\"Who can this Mr. Somebody be?\" asked uncle David, smiling. \"A foolish\nperson that spoils you both I dare say, and gives you large slices of\nbread and jelly like this. Hold them carefully! Now, good bye, and joy\nbe with you.\"\n\nBut it was with rather rueful faces that Harry and Laura left the room,\nwishing they might have remained another hour to talk nonsense with\nuncle David, and dreading to think what new scrapes and difficulties\nthey would get into in the nursery, which always seemed to them a place\nof torture and imprisonment.\n\nMajor Graham used to say that Mrs. Crabtree should always have a\nthermometer in her own room when she dressed, to tell her whether the\nweather was hot or cold, for she seemed to feel no difference, and\nscarcely ever made any change in her own attire, wearing always the same\npink gown and scarlet shawl, which made her look like a large red\nflower-pot, while she was no more annoyed with the heat than a\nflower-pot would have been. On this very oppressive morning she took as\nmuch pains in suffocating Harry with a silk handkerchief round his neck,\nas if it had been Christmas, and though Laura begged hard for leave to\ngo without one of her half-a-dozen wrappings, she might as well have\nasked permission to go without her head, as Mrs. Crabtree seemed\nperfectly deaf upon the subject.\n\n\"This day is so very cold and so very shivering,\" said Harry, slyly,\n\"that I suppose you will make Laura wear at least fifty shawls.\"\n\n\"Not above twenty,\" answered Mrs. Crabtree, dryly. \"Give me no more of\nyour nonsense, Master Harry! This is no business of yours! I was in the\nworld long before you were born, and must know best; so hold your\ntongue. None but fools and beggars need ever be cold.\"\n\nAt last Mrs. Crabtree had heaped as many clothes upon her two little\nvictims, as she was pleased to think necessary; so she sallied forth\nwith them, followed by Betty, and proceeded towards the country, taking\nthe sunny side of the road, and raising clouds of dust at every step,\ntill Harry and Laura felt as if they had been made of wax, and were\nmelting away.\n\n\"Mrs. Crabtree!\" said Harry, \"did you hear uncle David's funny story\nyesterday? One hot morning a gentleman was watching an ant's nest, when\nhe observed, that every little insect, as it came out, plucked a small\nleaf, to hold over its head, as a parasol! I wish we could find leaves\nlarge enough for us.\"\n\n\"You must go to the Botanical Gardens, where one leaf of a palm-tree was\nshown to grandmama, which measured fourteen feet long,\" observed Laura.\n\"How horrid these very warm countries must be, where the heat is all the\nyear round like this!\"\n\n\"You may well say that,\" answered Mrs. Crabtree. \"I would not go to them\nEast Indies--no! not if I were Governess-General,--to be running away\nwith a tiger at your back, and sleeping with real live serpents twisted\nround the bed-post, and scorpions under your pillow! Catch me there! I'm\noften quite sorry for Master Frank, to think that his ship is maybe\ngoing that way! I'm told the very rats have such a smell in that\noutlandish place, that if they touch the outside of a bottle with their\ntails, it tastes of musk ever after; and when people are sitting\ncomfortably down, expecting to enjoy their dinner, a swarm of great ants\nwill come, and fall, an inch thick, on all the side-dishes. I've no\ndesire whatever to see foreign parts!\"\n\n\"But I wish to see every country in the universe,\" said Harry; \"and I\nhope there will be a rail-road all round the world before I am grown up.\nOnly think, Mrs. Crabtree, what fun lion-hunting must be, and catching\ndolphins, and riding on elephants.\"\n\nThe pedestrians had now arrived at the pretty village of Corstorphine,\nwhen they were unexpectedly met by Peter Grey, who joined them without\nwaiting to ask leave. Here the hills are so beautifully wooded, and the\nvillas so charming, that Harry, Peter, and Laura stopped a moment, to\nconsider what house they would like best to live in. Near one side of\nthe road stood a large cart of hay, on the top of which were several\nmen, forking it in at the window of a high loft, which could only be\nentered by a long ladder that leaned against the wall. It was a busy\njoyous scene, and soon attracted the children's whole attention, who\nwere transfixed with delight, seeing how rapidly the people ran up and\ndown, with their pitchforks in their hands, and tilted the hay from the\ncart into the loft, while they had many jokes and much laughter among\nthemselves. At last their whole business was finished, and the workmen\ndrove away for another supply, to the neighbouring fields, where they\nhad been raking and tossing it all morning, as merry as crickets.\n\n\"What happy people!\" exclaimed Harry, looking wistfully after the party,\nand wishing he might have scrambled into the cart beside them. \"I would\nbe a haymaker for nothing, if anybody would employ me; would not you,\nPeter?\"\n\n\"It is very strange,\" said Master Grey, \"why little ladies and gentlemen\nseem always obliged to endure a perfectly useless walk every day, as you\nand Laura are doing now. You never saw animals set out to take a stroll\nfor the good of their healths! How odd it would be to see a couple of\ndogs set off for a country walk!\"\n\n\"Miss Laura!\" said Mrs. Crabtree, \"Master Harry may rest here for a\nminute or two with Master Peter, and let them count their fingers, while\nyou come with Betty and me to visit a sick old aunt of mine who lives\nround the corner; but be sure, boys, you do not presume to wander about,\nor I shall punish you most severely. We are coming back in two minutes.\"\n\nMrs. Crabtree had scarcely disappeared into a small shabby-looking\ncottage, before Peter turned eagerly to Harry, with a face of great joy\nand importance, exclaiming, \"Only see how very lucky this is! The\nhaymakers have left their long ladder, standing on purpose for us! The\nwindow of that loft is wide open, and I must climb up immediately to\npeep in, because never, in all my life, did I see the inside of a\nhay-loft before!\"\n\n\"Nor I!\" added Harry. \"Uncle David says, that all round the floor there\nare deep holes, called mangers, down which food is thrown for the\nhorses, so that they can thrust their heads in, to take a bite, whenever\nthey choose.\"\n\n\"How I should hate to have my dinner hung up always before my nose in\nthat way! Suppose the kitchen were placed above your nursery, and that\nMrs. Marmalade showered down tarts and puddings, which were to remain\nthere till you ate them, you would hate the sight of such things at\nlast. But now, Harry, for the hay-loft.\"\n\nPeter scrambled so rapidly up the ladder, that he soon reached the top,\nand instantly vanished in at the window, calling eagerly for Harry to\nfollow. \"You never saw such a nice, clean, funny place as this, in all\nyour life!--make haste!--come faster!--never mind crushing your hat or\ntearing your jacket,--I'll put it all to rights. Ah! there!--that's the\nthing!--walk up, gentlemen! walk up!--the grand show!--sixpence each,\nand children half-price!\"\n\nAll this time, Harry was slowly, and with great difficulty, picking his\nsteps up the ladder, but a most troublesome business it was! First, his\nfoot became entangled in a rope,--then his hat got squeezed so out of\nshape, it looked perfectly tipsy,--next, one of his shoes nearly came\noff,--and afterwards he dropped his gloves; but at last he stumbled up\nin safety, and stood beside Peter in the loft, both laughing with\ndelight at their own enterprize.\n\nThe quantity of hay piled up on all sides, astonished them greatly,\nwhile the nice, wide floor between, seemed larger than any drawing-room,\nand was certainly made on purpose for a romp. Harry rolled up a large\nball of hay to throw at Peter, while he, in return, aimed at him, so\nthey ran after each other, round and round the loft, raising such a\nriot, that the very \"rafters dirled.\"\n\nThe hay now flew about in clouds, while they jumped over it, or crept\nunder it, throwing handfuls about in every direction, and observing that\nthis was the best play-room they had ever been in.\n\n\"How lucky that we came here!\" cried Peter. \"I should like to stay an\nhour at least!\"\n\n\"Oh! two hours,--or three,--or all day,\" added Harry. \"But what shall we\ndo about Mrs. Crabtree? She has not gone to settle for life with that\nold sick aunt, so I am afraid we must really be hurrying back, in case\nshe may find out our expedition, and that, you know, Peter, would be\ndreadful!\"\n\n\"Only fancy, Harry, if she sees you and me clinging to the ladder, about\nhalf way down! what a way she would be in!\"\n\n\"We had better make haste,\" said Harry, looking around. \"What would\ngrandmama say!--I wish we had never come up!\"\n\nAt this moment, Harry was still more brought to his senses, by hearing\nMrs. Crabtree's voice, exclaiming, in loud angry accents, \"Where in all\nthe world can those troublesome boys be gone! I must tether them to a\ntree the next time they are left together! Why! sure! they would not\nventure up that long ladder in the hay-loft! If they have, they had\nbetter never come down again, for I shall shew who is master here.\"\n\n\"Peter Grey would run up a ladder to the stars, if he could find one,\"\nreplied Betty. \"Here are Master Harry's gloves lying at the bottom of\nit. They can be gone nowhere else, for I have searched every other\nplace. We must send the town-crier with his bell after them, if they are\nnot found up there!\"\n\nMrs. Crabtree now seemed fearfully angry, while Laura began to tremble\nwith fright for Harry, who was listening overhead, and did not know very\nwell what to do, but foolishly thought it best to put off the evil hour\nof being punished as long as possible; so he and Peter silently crept in\nbelow a great quantity of hay, and hid themselves so cunningly, that\neven a thief-catcher could scarcely have discovered their den. In this\ndark corner, Harry had time to reflect and to feel more and more alarmed\nand sorry for his misconduct, so he said, in a very distressed voice,\n\"Oh, Peter! what a pity it is ever to be naughty, for we are always\nfound out, and always so much happier when we are good!\"\n\n\"I wonder how Mrs. Crabtree will get up the long ladder?\" whispered\nPeter, laughing. \"I would give my little finger, and one of my ears, to\nsee her and Betty scrambling along!\"\n\nHarry had to pinch Peter's arm almost black and blue before he would be\nquiet; and by the time he stopped talking, Mrs. Crabtree and Betty were\nboth standing in the hay-loft, exceedingly out of breath with climbing\nso unusually high, while Mrs. Crabtree very nearly fell, having stumbled\nover a step at the entrance.\n\n\"Why, sure! there's nobody here!\" exclaimed she, in a disappointed tone.\n\"And what a disorderly place this is! I thought a hay-loft was always\nkept in such nice order, with the floor all swept! but here is a fine\nmess! Those two great lumps of hay in the corner look as if they were\nmeant for people to sleep upon!\"\n\nHarry gave himself up for lost when Mrs. Crabtree noticed the place\nwhere he and Peter had buried themselves alive; but to his great relief,\nno suspicion seemed to have been excited, and neither of the two\nsearchers were anxious to venture beyond the door, after having so\nnearly tripped upon the threshold.\n\n\"They must have been stolen by a gipsey, or perhaps fallen into a well,\"\nsaid Betty, who rather liked the bustle of an accident. \"I always\nthought Master Peter would break his neck, or something of that kind.\nPoor thing! how distressed his papa will be!\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" interrupted Mrs. Crabtree, angrily. \"I wish people\nwould either speak sense, or not speak at all! Did you hear a noise\namong the hay?\"\n\n\"Rats, I dare say! or perhaps a dog!\" answered Betty, turning hastily\nround, and hurrying down the ladder faster than she had come up. \"I\ncertainly thought something moved in yon far corner.\"\n\n\"Where can that little shrimp of a boy be hid?\" added Mrs. Crabtree,\nfollowing. \"He must have obedience knocked like a nail into his head,\nwith a few good severe blows. I shall beat him to powder when once we\ncatch him.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon it,\" persisted Betty, \"that some gipsey has got the\nboys for the sake of their clothes. It will be a great pity, because\nMaster Harry had on his best blue jacket and trowsers.\"\n\nNo sooner was the loft cleared of these unwelcome visitors, than Harry\nand Peter began to recover from their panic, and jumped out of the hay,\nshaking themselves free from it, and skipping about in greater glee than\never.\n\nWhile they played about, as they had done before, and tumbled as if they\nhad been tumblers at Ducrow's, poor Harry got into such spirits, that he\ncompletely forgot about the deep holes called mangers, for containing\nthe horse's food, till all at once, when Peter was running after him, he\nfell, with a loud crash, headlong into one of them! Oh! what a scream he\ngave!--it echoed through the stable, terrifying a whole team of horses\nthat were feeding there, more particularly the one into whose manger he\nhad fallen. The horse gave a tremendous start when Harry plunged down\nclose to his nose, and not being able to run away, he put back his ears,\nopened his mouth, and kicked and struggled in the most frightful manner,\nwhile Harry, who could not make his escape any more than the horse,\nshouted louder and louder for help.\n\nPeter did all he could to assist Harry in this extraordinary\npredicament, but finding it impossible to be of any use, he forgot their\nterror of Mrs. Crabtree in his fears about Harry, and rushed to the\nwindow, calling back their two pursuers, who were walking away at a\ngreat distance. He screamed and hollooed, and waved his handkerchief,\nwithout ceasing, till at last Mrs. Crabtree heard him, and turned round,\nbut never was anybody more astonished then she was, on seeing him there,\nso she scolded, stormed, and raged, up to the very foot of the ladder.\n\n\"Now, you are the besiegers, and I am the garrison!\" cried Peter, when\nhe saw Mrs. Crabtree panting and toiling in her ascent. \"We must make a\ntreaty of peace together, for I could tumble you over in a minute, by\nmerely pushing this end a very little more to one side!\"\n\n\"Do not touch it, Master Peter!\" cried Mrs. Crabtree, almost afraid he\nwas in earnest. \"There is a good boy,--be quiet!\"\n\n\"A good boy!!\" whispered Peter to himself. \"What a fright Mrs. Crabtree\nmust be in, before she said that!\"\n\nThe next moment Mrs. Crabtree snatched Harry out of the manger, and\nshook him with rage. She then scolded and beat him, till he was\nperfectly stupified with fright and misery, after which the whole party\nwere allowed to proceed towards home, while Harry stumbled along the\nroad, and hung down his head, wishing, fifty times over, that he and\nPeter Grey had never gone up\n\n                              THE LONG LADDER.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE MAD BULL.\n\n  There's something in a noble boy,\n  A brave, free-hearted, careless one;\n  With his uncheck'd, unbidden joy,\n  His dread of books and love of fun.\n  And in his clear and ready smile,\n  Unshaded by a thought of guile\n  And unrepress'd by sadness,--\n  Which brings me to my childhood back,\n  As if I trod its very track,\n  And felt its very gladness.\n\n                                        Willis.\n\n\nOne evening, when Harry and Laura came down to dessert, they were\nsurprised to observe the two little plates usually intended for them,\nturned upside down, while uncle David pretended not to notice anything,\nthough he stole a glance to see what would happen next. On lifting up\nthese mysterious plates, what did they see lying underneath, but two\nletters with large red seals, one directed to \"Master Harry Graham,\" and\nthe other to \"Miss Laura Graham.\"\n\n\"A letter for me!!\" cried Harry, in a tone of delighted astonishment,\nwhile he tore open the seal, and his hand shook with impatience, so that\nhe could hardly unfold the paper. \"What can it be about! I like getting\na letter very much! Is it from papa? Did the postman bring it?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did,\" said uncle David: \"and he left a message that you must\npay a hundred pounds for it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Very likely, indeed,\" said Laura; \"you should pay that for telling me\nsuch a fine story; but my letter is worth more than a hundred pounds,\nfor it is inviting me to spend another delightful week at Holiday\nHouse.\"\n\n\"I am asked too! and not Mrs. Crabtree!\" cried Harry, looking at his\nletter, and almost screaming out for joy, whilst he skipped about the\nroom, rubbing his hands together, and ended by twirling Laura round and\nround, till they both fell prostrate on the floor.\n\n\"If that be meant as a specimen of how you intend to behave at Holiday\nHouse, we had better send your apology at once,\" observed Lady Harriet,\nsmiling. \"Lord Rockville is very particular about never hearing any\nnoise, and the slamming of a door, or even the creaking of a pair of\nunruly shoes, would put him distracted.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" added uncle David, \"Holiday House is as quiet as Harry's drum\nwith a hole in it. If a pin drops in any part of the mansion, Lord\nRockville becomes annoyed, and the very wasps scarcely dare to buz at\nhis window so loud as at any other person's. You will feel quite\nfish-out-of-water-ish, trying to be quiet and hum-drum for a whole week,\nso let me advise you not to go.\"\n\n\"The meaning of advice always is something that one would rather wish\nnot to do,\" observed Laura, gravely. \"I never in my life was advised to\nenjoy anything pleasant! Taking physic--or learning lessons--or staying\nat home, are very often advised, but never playing--or having a\nholiday--or amusing ourselves!\"\n\n\"You know, Laura! that Harry's little Shetland pony, Tom Thumb, in my\nfield, is of no use at present, but kicks, and capers, and runs about\nall day; yet presently he will be led out fastened to a rope, and made\nto trot round and round in a circle, day after day, till he has no\nlonger a will of his own,--that is education. Afterwards he shall have a\nbridle put in his mouth, which some little girls would be much the\nbetter of also, when he shall be carefully guided ever afterwards in the\nbest ways; and you likewise will go much more steadily for all the\nreining-in and whipping you have got from Mrs. Crabtree and me, which\nmay, perhaps, make you keep in the road of duty more easily hereafter.\"\n\n\"Uncle David!\" said Harry, laughing, \"we have read in the Arabian\nNights, about people being turned into animals, but I never thought you\nwould turn Laura into a horse! What shall we do with my little Shetland\npony if I go away next week?\"\n\n\"I have thought of a capital plan for making Tom Thumb useful during the\nwhole winter! Your grandmama wants a watch-dog in the country, so we\nshall build him a kennel--put a chain round his neck, and get some one\nto teach him to bark.\"\n\n\"Uncle David should be Professor of Nonsense at the University,\" said\nLady Harriet, smiling. \"But, my dear children, if you are allowed to pay\nthis visit at Holiday House, I hope you will endeavour to behave\ncreditably?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Major Graham, \"I understand that Lord Rockville wished to\nhave some particularly quiet children there, for a short time, so he\nfixed upon Harry and Laura! Poor, mistaken Lord Rockville! But, my good\nfriends, try not to break all his china ornaments the first day--spare a\nfew jars and tea-cups--leave a pane of glass or two in the windows, and\nthrow none of your marbles at the mirrors.\"\n\n\"I remember hearing,\" said Lady Harriet, \"that when Miss Pelham was\nmarried last year, her old aunt, Mrs. Bouverie, sent for her and said,\nthat as she could not afford to give baubles or trinkets, she would give\nher a very valuable piece of advice; and what do you think it was,\nLaura?\"\n\n\"I have no idea! Do tell me.\"\n\n\"Then I shall bestow it on you, as the old lady did on her niece--'Be\ncareful of china, paper and string, for they are all very transitory\npossessions in this world!'\"\n\n\"Very true! and most judicious!\" observed Major Graham, laughing. \"I\ncertainly know several persons who must have served an apprenticeship\nunder that good lady. Many gentlemen now, who despatch all their\nepistles from the club, because there the paper costs them nothing, and\na number of ladies, who, for the same good reason, never write letters\ntill they are visiting in a country house.\"\n\nHaving received so many warnings and injunctions about behaving well,\nHarry and Laura became so quiet during the first few days at Holiday\nHouse, that they were like shadows flitting through the rooms, going\nalmost on tiptoe, scarcely speaking above a whisper, and observing that\nvaluable rule for children, to let themselves be seen, but not heard.\nLord Rockville was quite charmed with such extreme good conduct, for\nthey were both in especial awe of him, and thought it a great\ncondescension if he even looked at them, he was so tall, so grand, and\nso grave, wearing a large powdered wig and silver spectacles, which gave\nhim a particularly venerable appearance, though Harry was one day very\nnear getting into disgrace upon that subject. His Lordship had a habit\nof always carrying two pairs of spectacles in his pocket, and often,\nafter thrusting one pair high on his forehead, he forgot where they\nwere, and put the others on his nose, which had such a droll appearance,\nthat the first time Harry saw it, he felt quite taken by surprise, and\nburst into a fit of laughter, upon which Lord Rockville gave him such a\ncomical look of surprise and perplexity, that Harry's fit of laughing\ngot worse and worse. The more people know they are wrong, and try to\nstop, the more convulsive it becomes, and the more difficult to look\ngrave again, so at last, after repeated efforts to appear serious and\ncomposed, Harry started up, and in his hurry to escape, very nearly\nslammed the door behind him, which would have given the last finish to\nhis offences.\n\nBoth the little visitors found Lady Rockville so extremely indulgent and\nkind, that she seemed like another grandmama, therefore they gradually\nventured to talk some of their own nonsense before her, and even to try\nsome of their old ways, and frolicsome tricks, which she seldom found\nany fault with, except when Harry one day eloped with Lord Rockville's\nfavourite walking-stick, to be used as a fishing-rod among the minnows,\nwith a long thread at the end for a line, and a crooked pin to represent\nthe hook, while, on the same day, Laura privately mounted the ass that\ngave Lord Rockville's ass's milk, and rode it all round the park, while\nhe sat at home expecting his usual refreshing tumbler. Still they both\npassed muster for being very tolerable children, and his Lordship was\nheard once to say, in a voice of great approbation, that Master and Miss\nGraham were so punctual at dinner, and so perfectly quiet, he really\noften forgot they were in the house. Indeed, Harry's complaisance on the\nday after he had laughed so injudiciously about the spectacles, was\nquite unheard of, as he felt anxious to make up for his misconduct; and\nwhen Lord Rockville asked if he would like a fire in the play-room, as\nthe evening was chilly, he answered very politely, \"Thank you, my Lord!\nWe are ready to think it hot or cold, just as you please!\"\n\nAll this was too good to last! One morning, when Harry and Laura looked\nout of the window, it was a most deplorably wet day. The whole sky\nlooked like a large grey cotton umbrella, and the clouds were so low\nthat Harry thought he could almost have touched them. In short, as Lord\nRockville remarked, \"it rained cats and dogs,\" so his Lordship knitted\nhis brows, and thrust his hands into his waistcoat pockets, walking up\nand down the room in a perfect fume of vexation, for he was so\naccustomed to be obeyed, that it seemed rather a hardship when even the\nweather contradicted his wishes. To complete his vexation, as \"single\nmisfortunes never come alone,\" his valet, when carelessly drying the\nMorning Post at a large kitchen fire, had set it in flames, so that all\nthe wonderful news it contained became reduced to ashes, therefore Lord\nRockville might well have given notice, that, for this day at least, he\nhad a right to be in extremely bad humour.\n\nLady Rockville privately recommended Harry and Laura to sit quietly down\nand play at cat's cradle, which accordingly they did, and when that\nbecame no longer endurable, some dominos were produced. Thus the morning\nwore tediously away till about two o'clock, when suddenly the rain\nstopped, the sun burst forth with prodigious splendour, every leaf in\nthe park glittered, as if it had been sprinkled with diamonds, and a\nhundred birds seemed singing a chorus of joy, while bees and butterflies\nfluttered at the windows and flew away rejoicing.\n\nHarry was the first to observe this delightful change, and with an\nexclamation of delight, he sprang from his seat, pulled Laura from hers,\nupset the domino-table, and rushed out of the room, slamming the door\nwith a report like twenty cannons. Away they both flew to the forest,\nLaura swinging her bonnet in her hand, and Harry tossing his cap in the\nair, while Lord Rockville watched them angrily from the drawing-room\nwindow, saying, in a tone of extreme displeasure, \"That boy has a voice\nthat might do for the town-crier! He laughs so loud, it is enough to\ncrack every glass in the room! I wish he were condemned to pass a week\nin those American prisons where no one is allowed to speak. In short, he\nwould be better anywhere than here, for I might as well live with a\nhammer and tongs, as with the two children together. They are more\nrestless than the quicksilver figures from China, and I wish they were\nas quiet, but my only comfort is, that at any rate they come home\npunctually to dinner at five. Nothing is so intolerable as people\ndropping in too late and disordering the table.\"\n\nMeantime, the woods at Holiday House rung with sounds of mirth and\ngaiety, while Harry scrambled up the trees like a squirrel, and swung\nupon the branches, gathering walnuts and crab-apples for Laura, after\nwhich they both cut their names upon the bark of Lord Rockville's\nfavourite beech, so that every person who passed that way must observe\nthe large distinct letters. They were laughing and chatting over this\nexploit, both talking at once, as noisy and happy as possible, and\nexpecting nothing particular to happen, when, all on a sudden, Laura\nturned pale, and grasped hold of Harry's arm, saying, in a low\nfrightened voice,\n\n\"Hush, Harry!--hush!--I hear a very strange noise. It sounds like some\nwild beast! What can that be?\"\n\nHarry listened as if he had ten pair of ears, and nearly cracked his\neye-balls staring round him, to see what could be the matter. A curious\ndeep growling sound might be heard at some distance, while there was the\nnoise of something trampling heavily on the ground, and of branches\nbreaking off the trees, as if some large creature was forcing his way\nthrough. Harry and Laura now stood like a couple of little statues, not\ndaring to breathe, they felt so terrified! The noise grew louder and\nlouder, while it gradually came nearer and nearer, till at length a\nlarge black bull burst into view, with his tail standing high in the\nair, while he tore up the ground with his horns, bellowing as loudly as\nhe could roar, and galloping straight towards the place where they\nstood.\n\nLaura's knees tottered under her, and she instantly dropped on the\nground with terror, feeling as if she would die the next minute of\nfright, while, as for attempting to escape, it never entered her head to\nthink that possible. Harry felt quite differently, for he was a bold\nboy, not easily scared out of his senses, and instantly saw that\nsomething must be done, or they would both be lost. Many selfish people\nwould have run away alone, without caring for the safety of any one but\nthemselves, which was not at all the case with Harry, who thought first\nof his poor frightened companion. \"Hollo, Laura! are you hiding in a\ncart rut?\" he exclaimed, pulling her hastily off the ground. \"The bull\nwill soon find you there! Come! come! as fast as possible! we must have\na race for it yet! That terrible beast can scarcely make his way through\nthe trees and branches, they grow so closely! Perhaps we may get on as\nfast as he!\"\n\nAll this time, Harry was dragging Laura along, and running himself into\nthe thickest part of the plantation; but it was very difficult to make\nany progress, as she had become quite faint and bewildered with fright.\n\n\"Oh, Harry!\" cried she, trembling all over, \"you must get on alone! I am\nso weak with terror, it is impossible to run a step farther.\"\n\n\"Do not waste your breath with talking,\" answered Harry, still pushing\non at full speed. \"How can you suppose I would be so shabby as to make\nmy escape without you! No! no! we must either both be caught, or both\nget off!\"\n\nLaura felt so grateful to Harry when he said this, that she seemed for a\nmoment almost to forget the bull, which was still coming furiously on\nbehind, while she now made a desperate exertion to run faster than she\nhad been able to do before, clearing the ground almost as rapidly as\nHarry could have done, though he still held her firmly by the hand, to\nencourage her.\n\nThe trampling noise continued, the breaking of branches, and the\nfrightful bellowing of this dreadful animal, when at last Harry caught\nsight of a wooden paling, which he silently pointed out to Laura, being\nquite unable now to speak. Having rushed forward to it, with almost\nfrantic haste, Harry threw himself over the top, after which he helped\nLaura to squeeze herself through underneath, when they proceeded rather\nmore leisurely onwards.\n\n\"That fence will puzzle Mr. Bull,\" said Harry triumphantly, yet gasping\nfor breath. \"We can push through places where his great hoof could\nscarcely be thrust! I saw him coming along, with his heels high in the\nair, and his head down, like an enormous wheel-barrow.\"\n\nScarcely had Harry spoken, before the infuriated animal advanced at full\ngallop towards the fence, and after running along the side a little way,\nhe suddenly tore up the paling with his horns, as if it had been made of\npaper, and rushed forward more rapidly than ever.\n\nHarry now began to fear that indeed all was over, for his strength had\nbecome nearly exhausted, when, to his great joy, he espied a large,\nrough stone wall, not very far off, which was as welcome a sight as land\nto a shipwrecked sailor.\n\n\"Run for your life, Laura!\" he cried, pointing it out, to encourage her.\n\"There is safety, if we reach it.\"\n\nOn they both flew, faster than the wind, and Harry having scrambled up\nthe wall, like a grasshopper, pulled Laura up beside him, and there they\nboth stood at last, encamped quite beyond the reach of danger, though\nthe enemy arrived a few minutes afterwards, pawing the air, and foaming\nand bellowing with disappointment.\n\n\"Laura!\" said Harry, after she had a little recovered from her fright,\nand was walking slowly homewards, while she cast an alarmed glance\nfrequently behind, thinking she still heard the bull in pursuit, \"you\nsee, as uncle David says, whatever danger people are in, it is foolish\nto be quite in despair, but we should rather think what it is best to\ndo, and do it directly.\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry! and I shall never forget that you would not forsake me,\nbut risked your own life, like a brave brother, in my defence. I should\nlike to do as much for you another time!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Laura, as much as if you had, but I hope we shall never be\nin such a scrape again! If Frank were here, he would put us both in mind\nto thank a merciful God for taking so much care of us, and bringing us\nsafely home!\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry! It is perhaps a good thing being in danger sometimes, to\nremind us that we cannot be safe or happy an hour without God's care, so\nin our prayers to-night we must remember what has happened, and return\nthanks very particularly.\"\n\nIt was long past five before Harry and Laura reached Holiday House,\nwhere Lord Rockville met them at the drawing-room door, looking taller,\nand grander, and graver than ever, while Lady Rockville rose from her\nsofa, and came up to them, saying, in a tone of gentle reproach,\n\n\"My dear children! you ought to return home before the dinner hour, and\nnot keep his Lordship waiting!\"\n\nThe very idea of Lord Rockville waiting dinner was too dreadful ever to\nhave entered their heads till this minute; but Harry and Laura\nimmediately explained how exceedingly sorry they were for what had\noccurred, and to show that it was their misfortune rather than their\nfault, they told the whole frightful story of the mad bull, to which\nLady Rockville listened, as if her very hair were standing upon end, to\nhear of such doings. She even turned up her eyes with astonishment to\nthink what a wonderful escape they had made; but his Lordship frowned\nthrough his spectacles, and leaned his chin upon his stick, looking, as\nHarry thought, very like a bear upon a pole.\n\n\"Pshaw!--nonsense!\" exclaimed Lord Rockville impatiently. \"The bull\nwould have done you no harm! He is a most respectable, quiet,\nwell-disposed animal, and brought an excellent character from his last\nplace! I never heard a complaint of him before!\"\n\n\"It is curious,\" observed Laura, \"that all bulls are reckoned peaceable\nand tame, till they have tossed two or three people, and killed them!\"\n\n\"I thought,\" added Lord Rockville, looking very grand and contemptuous,\n\"that Harry was grown more a man than to be so easily put to flight.\nWhen a bull, another time, threatens to toss you, seize hold of his\ntail,--or toss him!--or, in short, do anything rather than run away the\nfirst time an animal looks at you. This is a mere cock-and-a-bull story,\nto excuse your keeping me waiting almost a quarter of an hour for my\ndinner!--you should be made guard of a mail-coach for a month, to teach\nyou punctuality, Master Graham.\"\n\nLord Rockville gravely looked at his watch, while Harry luckily\nconsidered how often his grandmama had recommended him to make no answer\nwhen he was scolded, so he nearly bit off the tip of his tongue to keep\nit quiet, while he could not but wish, in his own mind, that my Lord\nhimself saw how very fierce the bull had looked.\n\nLaura felt more vexed on Harry's account than her own, and the dinner\nwent on as uncomfortably as possible; for even when a French cook has\ndressed it, if ill-humour be the sauce, any dish becomes unpalatable.\nNothing was to be seen reflected on the surface of many fine silver\ncovers, but very cross, or very melancholy faces; while Lady Rockville\ntried to make her own countenance look both cheerful and good-natured.\nShe told Harry and Laura, to divert them, that old Mrs. Bouverie had\nonce been pursued by a furious milch cow, along a lane, flanked on both\nsides by such very high walls, that escape seemed impossible, so the\ngood lady, who was fat and breathless, became so desperate, that without\na hope of getting off, she seized the enraged animal by the horns, and\nscreamed in its face, till the cow herself became frightened. The\ncreature stared, stepping backwards and backwards, with increasing\nalarm, till at last, to the old lady's great relief and surprise, she\nfairly turned her tail and ran off.\n\nIn the evening, Lord Rockville had not yet recovered his equanimity, and\nwent out, rather in bad humour, to take his usual walk before supper.\nWithout once remembering about Harry and the bull, he strolled a great\nway into the woods, marking several trees to be cut down, and admiring a\nfine forest which he had planted himself long ago, but without\nparticularly considering what way he turned. It was beginning, at last,\nto grow very dark and gloomy, so Lord Rockville had some thoughts of\nreturning home, when he became suddenly startled by hearing a loud roar\nnot far off, and a moment afterwards the furious bull dashed out of a\nneighbouring thicket, raging and foaming, and tearing the ground with\nhis horns, exactly as Harry had described in the morning, while poor\nLord Rockville, who seldom moved faster than a very dignified walk,\ninstantly quickened his pace, in an opposite direction, striding away\nfaster and faster, till at last,--it must be confessed,--his Lordship\nended by running!!!\n\nIn spite of all Lord Rockville's exertions, the bull continued rapidly\nto gain upon him, for his Lordship, being rather corpulent and easily\nfatigued, stopped every now and then to gasp for breath; till at last,\nfeeling it impossible to get on faster, though the stables were now\nwithin sight, he seized the branch of a large oak tree, which swept\nnearly to the ground, and contrived, with great difficulty, to scramble\nout of reach.\n\nThe enraged bull gazed up into the tree and bellowed with fury, when he\nsaw Lord Rockville so judiciously perched overhead, and he remained for\nhalf-an-hour, watching to see if his Lordship would venture down again.\nAt last the tormenting animal began leisurely eating grass under the\ntree, but gradually he moved away, turning his back while he fed, till\nLord Rockville vainly deluded himself with the hope of stealing off\nunobserved. Being somewhat rested and refreshed, while the enemy was\nlooking in another direction, he descended cautiously, as if he had been\ngoing to tread upon needles and pins; but, unaccustomed to such\nmovements, he jumped so heavily upon the ground, that the bull hearing a\nnoise, turned round, and set up a loud furious roar, when he saw his\nintended victim again within reach.\n\nNow the race began once more with redoubled agility! The odds seemed\ngreatly in favour of the bull, and Lord Rockville thought he already\nfelt the animal's horns in his side, when a groom, who saw the party\napproaching, instantly seized a pitchfork and flew to the rescue of his\nmaster. Lord Rockville never stopped his career till he reached the\nstable, and ran up into a loft, from the window of which he gave the\nalarm and called for more assistance, when several ploughmen and\nstable-boys assembled, who drove the animal with great difficulty, into\na stall, where he continued so ungovernable, that iron chains were put\nround his neck, and some days afterwards, seeing no one could manage\nhim, Lord Rockville ordered the bull to be shot, and his carcase turned\ninto beef for the poor of the parish, who all, consequently, rejoiced at\nhis demise; though the meat turned out so tough, that it required their\nbest teeth to eat it with.\n\nMeantime, on that memorable evening of so many adventures, Harry, Laura,\nand Lady Rockville, wondered often what had become of his Lordship, and,\nat last, when supper appeared at the usual hour, his absence became\nstill more unaccountable!\n\n\"What can be the matter?\" exclaimed Lady Rockville, anxiously. \"This is\nvery odd! His Lordship is as punctual as the postman in general!\nespecially for supper; and here is Lord Rockville's favourite dish of\nsago and wine, which will become uneatably cold in ten minutes, if he\ndoes not return home to enjoy it!\"\n\nScarcely had she finished speaking, when the door opened and Lord\nRockville walked majestically into the room. There was something so\ndifferent from usual in his manner and appearance, however, that Harry\nand Laura exchanged looks of astonishment; his neckcloth was loose--his\nface excessively red--and his hand shook, while he breathed so hard,\nthat he might have been heard at the porter's lodge. Lady Rockville\ngazed with amazement at all she saw, and then asked what he chose for\nsupper; but when Lord Rockville tried to speak, the words died on his\nlips, so he could only point in silence to the sago and wine.\n\n\"What in all the world has happened to you this evening, my Lord?\"\nexclaimed Lady Rockville, unable to restrain her curiosity a moment\nlonger. \"I never saw you in such a way before! Your eyes are perfectly\nblood-shot--your dress strangely disordered--and you seem so hot and so\nfatigued! Tell me!--what is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" answered Lord Rockville, drawing himself up, while he tried\nto look grander and graver than ever, though his Lordship could not help\npanting for breath--putting his hands to his sides--and wiping his\nforehead with his pocket-handkerchief in an agony of fatigue. Harry\nobserved all this for some time, as eagerly and intently as a cat\nwatches a bird on a tree. He saw that something extraordinary had\noccurred, and he began to have hopes that it really was the very thing\nhe wished; because, seeing Lord Rockville now perfectly safe, he would\nnot have grudged him a pretty considerable fright from his friend the\nbull. At last, unable any longer to control his impatience, Harry\nstarted off his chair, gazing so earnestly at Lord Rockville, that his\neyes almost sprung out of their sockets, while he rubbed his hands with\necstacy, saying,\n\n\"I guess you've seen the bull? Oh! I am sure you did! Pray tell us if\nyou have? Did he run after you,--and did you run away?\"\n\nLord Rockville tried more than he had ever done in his life to look\ngrave, but it would not do. Gradually his face relaxed into a smile,\ntill at last he burst into loud peals of laughter, joined most heartily\nby Harry, Laura, and Lady Rockville. Nobody recovered any gravity during\nthe rest of that evening, for whenever they tried to think or talk\nquietly about anything else, Harry and Laura were sure to burst forth\nagain upon the subject, and even after being safely stowed in their beds\nfor the night, they both laughed themselves to sleep at the idea of Lord\nRockville himself having been obliged, after all, to run away from that\n\"most respectable, quiet, well-disposed animal,\n\n                              \"THE MAD BULL!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE BROKEN KEY.\n\n  First he moved his right leg,\n  Then he moved his left leg,\n  Then he said, \"I pardon beg,\"\n          And sat upon his seat.\n\n\n\"Oh! uncle David! uncle David!\" cried Laura, when they arrived from\nHoliday House, \"I would jump out of the carriage window with joy to see\nyou again; only the persons passing in the street might be surprised!\"\n\n\"Not at all! They are quite accustomed to see people jumping out of the\nwindows with joy, whenever I appear.\"\n\n\"We have so much to tell you,\" exclaimed Harry and Laura, each seizing\nhold of a hand, \"we hardly know where to begin!\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen! If you both talk at once, I must get a new pair\nof ears! So you have not been particularly miserable at Holiday House?\"\n\n\"No! no! uncle David! we did not think there had been so much happiness\nin the world,\" answered Laura, eagerly. \"The last two days we could do\nnothing but play and laugh, and\"----\n\n\"And grow fat! Why! you both look so well fed, you are just fit for\nkilling! I shall be obliged to shut you up two or three days, without\nanything to eat, as is done to pet lap-dogs, when they are getting\ncorpulent and gouty.\"\n\n\"Then we shall be like bears living on our paws,\" replied Harry, \"and\nuncle David! I would rather do that, than be a glutton like Peter Grey.\nHe went to a cheap shop lately, where old cheese-cakes were sold at\nhalf-price, and greedily devoured nearly a dozen, thinking that the dead\nflies scattered on the top were currants, till Frank shewed him his\nmistake!\"\n\n\"Frank should have let him eat in peace! There is no accounting for\ntastes. I once knew a lady who liked to swallow spiders! She used to\ncrack and eat them with the greatest delight, whenever she could catch\none.\"\n\n\"Oh! what a horrid woman! That is even worse than grandmama's story\nabout Dr. Manvers having dined on a dish of mice, fried in crumbs of\nbread!\"\n\n\"You know the old proverb, Harry, 'one man's meat is another man's\npoison.' The Persians are disgusted at our eating lobsters; and the\nHindoos think us scarcely fit to exist, because we live on beef; while\nwe are equally amazed at the Chinese for devouring dog pies, and\nbirds'-nest soup. You turn up your nose at the French for liking frogs;\nand they think us ten times worse with our singed sheep's head, oat\ncakes, and haggis.\"\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Lady Harriet, \"that when Charles X. lived in\nwhat he called the 'dear Canongate,' His Majesty was heard to say, that\nhe tried every sort of Scotch goose, 'the solan goose, the wild goose,\nand the tame goose; but the best goose of all, was the hag-goose.'\"\n\n\"Very polite, indeed, to adopt our national taste so completely,\"\nobserved uncle David, smiling. \"When my regiment was quartered in Spain,\nan officer of ours, a great epicure, and not quite so complaisant, used\nto say that the country was scarcely fit to live in, because there it is\ncustomary to dress almost every dish with sugar. At last, one day, in a\nrage, he ordered eggs to be brought up in their shells for dinner,\nsaying, 'that is the only thing the cook cannot possibly spoil.' We\nplayed him a trick, however, which was very like what you would have\ndone, Harry, on a similar occasion. I secretly put pounded sugar into\nthe salt-cellar, and when he tasted his first mouthful, you should have\nseen the look of fury with which he sprung off his seat, exclaiming,\n'the barbarians eat sugar even with their eggs!'\"\n\n\"That would be the country for me to travel in,\" said Harry. \"I could\nlive in a barrel of sugar; and my little pony, Tom Thumb, would be happy\nto accompany me there, as he likes anything sweet.\"\n\n\"All animals are of the same opinion. I remember the famous rider,\nDucrow, telling a brother-officer of mine, that the way in which he\ngains so much influence over his horses, is merely by bribing them with\nsugar. They may be managed in that way like children, and are quite\naware, if it be taken from them as a punishment for being restive.\"\n\n\"Oh! those beautiful horses at Ducrow's! How often I think of them since\nwe were there!\" exclaimed Harry. \"They were quite like fairies, with\nfine arched necks, and long tails!\"\n\n\"I never heard before of a fairy with a long tail, Master Harry; but\nperhaps in the course of your travels you may have seen such a thing.\"\n\n\"How I should like to ride upon Tom Thumb, in Ducrow's way, with my toe\non the saddle!\"\n\n\"Fine doings indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, who had entered the room\nat this moment. \"Have you forgotten already, Master Harry, how many of\nthe nursery plates you broke one day when I was out, in trying to copy\nthat there foolish Indian juggler, who tossed his plates in the air, and\ntwirled them on his thumb! There must be no more such nonsense; for if\nonce your neck is broke by a fall off Tom Thumb, no doctor that I know\nof can mend it again. Remember what a terrible tumble you had off Jessy\nlast year!\"\n\n\"You are always speaking about that little overturn, Mrs. Crabtree; and\nit was not worth recollecting above a week! Did you never see a man\nthrown off his horse before?\"\n\n\"A man and horse indeed!\" said uncle David, laughing, when he looked at\nHarry. \"You and your charger were hardly large enough then for a\ntoy-shop; and you must grow a little more, Captain Gulliver, before you\nwill be fit for a dragoon regiment.\"\n\nHarry and Laura stayed very quietly at home for several weeks after\ntheir return from Holiday House, attending so busily to lessons, that\nuncle David said he felt much afraid they were going to be a pair of\nlittle wonders, who would die of too much learning.\n\n\"You will be taken ill of the multiplication table some day, and\nconfined to bed with a violent fit of geography! Pray take care of\nyourselves, and do not devour above three books at once,\" said Major\nGraham one day, entering the room with a note in his hand. \"Here is an\ninvitation that I suppose you are both too busy to accept, so perhaps I\nmight as well send an apology; eh, Harry?\"\n\nDown dropped the lesson-books upon the floor, and up sprung Harry in an\necstacy of delight. \"An invitation! Oh! I like an invitation so very\nmuch! Pray tell us all about it!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is an invitation to spend a month with Dr. Lexicon. What\nwould you say to that? They breakfast upon Latin grammars at school, and\nhave a dish of real French verbs, smothered in onions, for dinner every\nday.\"\n\n\"But in downright earnest, uncle David! where are we going?\"\n\n\"Must I tell you? Well! that good-natured old lady, Mrs. Darwin, intends\ntaking a large party of children next week, in her own carriage, to pass\nten days at Ivy Lodge, a charming country house about twenty miles off,\nwhere you are all to enjoy perfect happiness. I wish I could be ground\ndown into a little boy myself, for the occasion! Poor good woman! what a\nlife she will lead! There is only one little drawback to your delight,\nthat I am almost afraid to announce.\"\n\n\"What is that, uncle David?\" asked Harry, looking as if nothing in\nnature could ever make him grave again. \"Are we to bite off our own\nnoses before we return?\"\n\n\"Not exactly; but somebody is to be of the party who will do it for you.\nMrs. Darwin has heard that there are certain children who become\noccasionally rather unmanageable! I cannot think who they can be, for it\nis certainly nobody we ever saw; so she has requested that Mrs. Crabtree\nwill follow in the mail-coach.\"\n\nHarry and Laura looked as if a glass of cold water had been thrown in\ntheir faces, after this was mentioned; but they soon forgot every little\nvexation, in a burst of joy, when, some days afterwards, Mrs. Darwin\nstopped at the door to pick them up, in the most curious-looking\ncarriage they had ever seen. It was a very large open car, as round as a\nbird's nest, and so perfectly crowded with children, that nobody could\nhave supposed any room left even for a doll; but Mrs. Darwin said that\nwhatever number of people came in, there was always accommodation for\none more; and this really proved to be the case, for Harry and Laura\nsoon elbowed their way into seats and set off, waving their\nhandkerchiefs to Major Graham, who had helped to pack them in, and who\nnow stood smiling at the door.\n\nAs this very large vehicle was drawn by only one horse, it proceeded\nvery slowly; but Mrs. Darwin amused the children with several very\ndiverting stories, and gave them a grand luncheon in the carriage; after\nwhich, they threw what was left, wrapped up in an old newspaper, to some\npeople breaking stones on the road, feeling quite delighted to see the\nsurprise and joy of the poor labourers when they opened the parcel. In\nshort, everybody became sorry when this diverting journey was finished,\nand they drove up, at last, to the gate of a tall old house, that looked\nas if it had been built in the year one. The walls were very thick, and\nquite mouldy with age. Indeed, the only wonder was, that Ivy Lodge had\nstill a roof upon its head, for every thing about it looked so tottering\nand decayed. The very servants were all old; and a white-headed butler\nopened the door, who looked as frail and gloomy as the house; but before\nlong, the old walls of Ivy Lodge rung and echoed again with sounds of\nmirth and joy. It seemed to have been built on purpose for hide and\nseek; there were rooms with invisible doors, and closets cut in the\nwalls, and great old chests where people might have been buried alive\nfor a year, without being found out. The gardens, too, were perfectly\nenchanting. Such arbours to take strawberries and cream in! and such\nsummer-houses, where they drank tea out of doors every evening! Here\nthey saw a prodigious eagle, fastened to the ground by a chain, and\nlooking the most dull, melancholy creature in the world; while Harry\nwished the poor bird might be liberated, and thought how delightful it\nwould be to stand by and see him soaring away to his native skies.\n\n\"Yes! with a large slice of raw meat in his beak!\" said Peter Grey, who\nwas always thinking of eating. \"I dare say he lives much better here,\nthan he would do killing his own mutton up in the clouds there, or\ntaking his chance of a dead horse on the sea-shore occasionally.\"\n\nHarry and Peter were particularly amused with Mrs. Darwin's curious\ncollection of pets. There were black swans with red bills, swimming\ngracefully in a pond close to the window, and ready to rush forward on\nthe shortest notice, for a morsel of bread. The lop-eared rabbits also\nsurprised them, with their ears hanging down to the ground, and they\nwere interested to see a pair of carrier-pigeons which could carry\nletters as well as the postman. Mrs. Darwin showed them tumbler pigeons\ntoo, that performed a summerset in the air when they flew, and horsemen\nand dragoon pigeons, trumpeters and pouters, till Peter Grey at last\nbegged to see the pigeons that made the pigeon-pies, and the cow that\ngave the butter-milk; he was likewise very anxious for leave to bring\nhis fishing-rod into the drawing-room, to try whether he could catch one\nof the beautiful gold-fish that swam about in a large glass globe,\nsaying he thought it might perhaps be very good to eat at breakfast.\nMrs. Darwin had a pet lamb that she was exceedingly fond of, because it\nfollowed her everywhere, and Harry, who was very fond of the little\ncreature, said he wished some plan could be invented to hinder its ever\ngrowing into a great fat vulgar sheep; and he thought the white mice\nwere old animals that had grown grey with years.\n\nThere were donkies for the children to ride upon, and Mrs. Darwin had a\nboat that held the whole party, to sail in, round the pond, and she hung\nup a swing that seemed to fly about as high as the house, which they\nswung upon, after which they were allowed to shake the fruit-trees, and\nto eat whatever came down about their ears; so it very often rained\napples and pears in the gardens at Ivy Lodge, for Peter seemed never to\ntire of that joke; indeed the apple-trees had a sad life of it as long\nas he remained.\n\nPeter told Mrs. Darwin that he had \"a patent appetite,\" which was always\nready on every occasion; but the good lady became so fond of stuffing\nthe children at all hours, that even he felt a little puzzled sometimes\nhow to dispose of all she heaped upon his plate, while both Harry and\nLaura, who were far from greedy, became perfectly wearied of hearing the\ngong. The whole party assembled at eight every morning, to partake of\nporridge and butter-milk, after which, at ten, they breakfasted with\nMrs. Darwin on tea, muffins, and sweetmeats. They then drove in the\nround open car, to bathe in the sea, on their return from which,\nluncheon was always ready, and after concluding that, they might pass\nthe interval till dinner among the fruit-trees. They never could eat\nenough to please Mrs. Darwin at dinner; tea followed, on a most\nsubstantial plan; their supper consisted of poached eggs, and the maid\nwas desired to put a biscuit under every visitor's pillow, in case the\nyoung people should be hungry in the night, for Mrs. Darwin said she had\nbeen starved at school herself, when she was a little girl, and wished\nnobody ever to suffer, as she had done, from hunger.\n\nThe good lady was so anxious for everything to be exactly as the\nchildren liked it, that sometimes Laura felt quite at a loss what to say\nor do. One day, having cracked her egg-shell at breakfast, Mrs. Darwin\npeeped anxiously over her shoulder, saying,\n\n\"I hope, my dear! your egg is all right?\"\n\n\"Most excellent indeed!\"\n\n\"Is it quite fresh?\"\n\n\"Perfectly! I dare say it was laid only a minute before it was boiled!\"\n\n\"I have seen the eggs much larger than that.\"\n\n\"Yes! but then I believe they are rather coarse,--at least we think so,\nwhen Mrs. Crabtree gives us a turkey egg at dinner.\"\n\n\"If you prefer them small, perhaps you would like a guinea-fowl's egg?\"\n\n\"Thank you! but this one is just as I like them.\"\n\n\"It looks rather over-done! If you think so, we could get another in a\nminute!\"\n\n\"No! they are better well boiled!\"\n\n\"Then probably it is not enough done. Some people like them quite hard,\nand I could easily pop it into the slop-basin for another minute.\"\n\n\"I am really obliged to you, but it could not be improved.\"\n\n\"Do you not take any more salt with your egg?\"\n\n\"No, I thank you!\"\n\n\"A few more grains would improve it!\"\n\n\"If you say so, I dare say they will.\"\n\n\"Ah! now I am afraid you have put in too much! pray do get another!\"\n\nThis long-continued attack upon her egg was too much for Laura's\ngravity, who appeared for some minutes to have a violent fit of\ncoughing, and ending in a burst of laughter, after which she hastily\nfinished all that remained of it, and thus ended the discussion.\n\nIn the midst of all their happiness, while the children thought that\nevery succeeding day had no fault but being too short, and Harry even\nplanned with Peter to stop the clock altogether, and see whether time\nitself would not stand still, nobody ever thought for a moment of\nanything but joy; and yet a very sad and sudden distress awaited Mrs.\nDarwin. One forenoon she received a letter that seemed very hastily and\nawkwardly folded,--the seal was all to one side, and surrounded with\nstray drops of red wax,--the direction appeared sadly blotted, and at\nthe top was written in large letters, the words, \"To be delivered\nimmediately.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Darwin hurriedly tore open this very strange-looking letter,\nshe found that it came from her own housekeeper in town, to announce the\ndreadful event that her sister, Lady Barnet, had been that day seized\nwith an apoplectic fit, and was thought to be at the point of death,\ntherefore it was hoped that Mrs. Darwin would not lose an hour in\nreturning to town, that she might be present on the melancholy occasion.\nThe shock of hearing this news was so very great, that poor Mrs. Darwin\ncould not speak about it, but after trying to compose herself for a few\nminutes, she went into the play-room, and told the children that, for\nreasons she could not explain, they must get ready to return home in an\nhour, when the car would be at the door for their journey.\n\nNothing could exceed their surprise on hearing Mrs. Darwin make such an\nunexpected proposal. At first Peter Grey thought she was speaking in\njest, and said he would prefer if she ordered out a balloon to travel\nin, this morning; but when it appeared that Mrs. Darwin was really in\nearnest about their pleasant visit being over so soon, Harry's face grew\nperfectly red with passion, while he said in a loud angry voice,\n\n\"Grandmama allowed me to stay here till Friday!--and I was invited to\nstay,--and I will not go anywhere else!\"\n\n\"Oh fie, Master Harry!\" said Mrs. Crabtree. \"Do not talk so! You ought\nto know better! I shall soon teach you, however, to do as you are bid!\"\n\nSaying these words, she stretched out her hand to seize violent hold of\nhim, but Harry dipped down and escaped. Quickly opening the door, he\nran, half in joke and half in earnest, at full speed up two pairs of\nstairs, followed closely by Mrs. Crabtree, who was now in a terrible\nrage, especially when she saw what a piece of fun Harry thought this\nfatiguing race. A door happened to be standing wide open on the second\nlanding-place, which, having been observed by Harry, he darted in, and\nslammed it in Mrs. Crabtree's face, locking and double-locking it, to\nsecure his own safety, after which he sat down in this empty apartment\nto enjoy his victory in peace. When people once begin to grow\nself-willed and rebellious, it is impossible to guess where it will all\nend! Harry might have been easily led to do right at first, if any one\nhad reasoned with him and spoken kindly, but now he really was in a sort\nof don't-care-a-button humour, and scarcely minded what he did next.\n\nAs long as Mrs. Crabtree continued to scold and rave behind the door,\nHarry grew harder and harder; but at length the good old lady, Mrs.\nDarwin herself, arrived up stairs, and represented how ungrateful he\nwas, not doing all in his power to please her, when she had taken so\nmuch pains to make him happy. This brought the little rebel round in a\nmoment, as he became quite sensible of his own misconduct, and resolved\nimmediately to submit. Accordingly, Harry tried to open the door, but,\nwhat is very easily done cannot sometimes be undone, which turned out\nthe case on this occasion, as, with all his exertions, the key would not\nturn in the lock! Harry tried it first one way, then another. He twisted\nwith his whole strength, till his face became perfectly scarlet with the\neffort, but in vain! At last he put the poker through the handle of the\nkey, thinking this a very clever plan, and quite sure to succeed, but\nafter a desperate struggle, the unfortunate key broke in two, so then\nnobody could possibly open the door!\n\nAfter this provoking accident happened, Harry felt what a very bad boy\nhe had been, so he burst into tears, and called through the key-hole to\nbeg Mrs. Darwin's pardon, while Mrs. Crabtree scolded him through the\nkey-hole in return, till Harry shrunk away as if a cannonading had begun\nat his ear.\n\nMeantime, Mrs. Darwin hurried off, racking her brains to think what had\nbest be done to deliver the prisoner, since no time could be lost, or\nshe might perhaps not get to town at all that night, and the car was\nexpected every minute, to come round for the travellers. The gardener\nsaid he thought it might be possible to find a few ladders, which, being\ntied one above another, would perhaps reach as high as the window, where\nHarry had now appeared, and by which he could easily scramble down; so\nthe servants made haste to fetch all they could find, and to borrow all\nthey could see, till a great many were collected. These they joined\ntogether very strongly with ropes, but when it was at last reared\nagainst the wall, to the great disappointment of Mrs. Darwin, the\nladder appeared a yard and a-half too short!\n\nWhat was to be done?\n\nThe obliging gardener mounted to the very top of his ladder, and Harry\nleaned so far over the window, he seemed in danger of falling out, but\nstill they did not reach one another, so not a single person could guess\nwhat plan was to be tried next. At length Harry called out very loudly\nto the gardener,\n\n\"Hollo! Mr. King of Spades! If I were to let myself drop very gently\ndown from the window, could you catch me in your arms?\"\n\n\"Mr. Harry! Mr. Harry! if you dare!\" cried Mrs. Crabtree, shaking her\nfist at him. \"You'll be broken in pieces like a tea-pot, you'll be made\nas flat as a pancake! Stay where you are! Do ye hear!\"\n\nBut Harry seemed suddenly grown deaf, and was now more than half\nout--fixing his fingers very firmly on the ledge of the window, and\nslowly dropping his legs downwards.\n\n\"Oh Harry! you will be killed!\" screamed Laura. \"Stop! stop! Harry, are\nyou mad? can nobody stop him?\"\n\nBut nobody could stop him, for, being so high above everybody's head,\nHarry had it all his own way, and was now nearly hanging altogether out\nof the window, but he stopped a single minute, and called out, \"Do not\nbe frightened, Laura! I have behaved very ill, and deserve the worst\nthat can happen. If I do break my head, it will save Mrs. Crabtree the\ntrouble of breaking it for me, after I come down.\"\n\nThe gardener now balanced himself steadily on the upper step of the\nladder, and spread his arms out, while Harry slowly let himself drop.\nLaura tried to look on without screaming out, as that might have\nstartled him, but the scene became too frightful, so she closed her\neyes, put her hands over her face and turned away, while her heart beat\nso violently, that it might almost have been heard. Even Mrs. Crabtree\nclasped her hands in an agony of alarm, while Mrs. Darwin put up her\npocket handkerchief, and could not look on another moment. An awful\npause took place, during which, a feather falling on the ground would\nhave startled them, when suddenly a loud shout from Peter Grey and the\nother children, which was gaily echoed from the top of the ladder, made\nLaura venture to look up, and there was Harry safe in the gardener's\narms, who soon helped him down to the ground, where he immediately asked\npardon of everybody for the fright he had given them.\n\nThere was no time for more than half a scold from Mrs. Crabtree, as Mrs.\nDarwin's car had been waiting some time; so Harry said she might be\nowing him the rest, on some future occasion.\n\n\"Yes! and a hundred lashes besides!\" added Peter Grey, laughing. \"Pray\ntouch him up well, Mrs. Crabtree, when you are about it. There is no law\nagainst cruelty to boys!\"\n\nThis put Mrs. Crabtree into such a rage, that she followed Peter with a\nperfect hail-storm of angry words, till at last, for a joke, he put up\nMrs. Darwin's umbrella to screen himself, and immediately afterwards the\ncar drove slowly off.\n\nWhen uncle David heard all the adventures at Ivy Lodge, he listened most\nattentively to \"the confessions of Master Harry Graham,\" and shook his\nhead in a most serious manner after they were concluded, saying, \"I have\nalways thought that boys are like cats, with nine lives at least! You\nshould be hung up in a basket, Harry, as they do with unruly boys in the\nSouth Sea Islands, where such young gentlemen as you are left dangling\nin the air for days together without a possibility of escape!\"\n\n\"I would not care for that compared with being teazed and worried by\nMrs. Crabtree. I really wish, uncle David, that Dr. Bell would order me\nnever to be scolded any more! It is very bad for me! I generally feel an\nodd sort of over-all-ish-ness as soon as she begins; and I am getting\ntoo big now, for any thing but a birch-rod like Frank. How pleasant it\nis to be a grown-up man, uncle David, as you are, sitting all day at the\nclub with your hat on your head, and nothing to do but look out of the\nwindow. That is what I call happiness!\"\n\n\"But once upon a time, Harry,\" said Lady Harriet, \"when I stopped in the\ncarriage for your uncle David at the club, he was in the middle of such\na yawn at the window, that he very nearly dislocated his jaw! it was\nquite alarming to see him, and he told me in a great secret, that the\nlongest and most tiresome hours of his life are, when he has nothing\nparticular to do.\"\n\n\"Now, at this moment, I have nothing particular to do,\" said Major\nGraham, \"therefore I shall tell you a wonderful story, children, about\nliking to be idle or busy, and you must find out the moral for\nyourselves.\"\n\n\"A story! a story!\" cried Harry and Laura, in an ecstacy of delight, and\nas they each had a knee of uncle David's, which belonged to themselves,\nthey scrambled into their places, exclaiming, \"Now let it be all about\nvery bad boys, and giants, and fairies!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. UNCLE DAVID'S NONSENSICAL STORY ABOUT GIANTS AND FAIRIES.\n\n  \"Pie-crust and pastry-crust, that was the wall;\n  The windows were made of black-puddings and white,\n  And slated with pancakes--you ne'er saw the like!\"\n\n\nIn the days of yore, children were not all such clever, good sensible\npeople as they are now! Lessons were then considered rather a plague,\nsugar-plums were still in demand--holidays continued yet in fashion--and\ntoys were not then made to teach mathematics, nor story-books to give\ninstruction in chemistry and navigation. These were very strange times,\nand there existed at that period, a very idle, greedy, naughty boy, such\nas we never hear of in the present day. His papa and mama were----no\nmatter who,----and he lived, no matter where. His name was Master\nNo-book, and he seemed to think his eyes were made for nothing but to\nstare out of the windows, and his mouth for no other purpose but to eat.\nThis young gentleman hated lessons like mustard, both of which brought\ntears into his eyes, and during school-hours, he sat gazing at his\nbooks, pretending to be busy, while his mind wandered away to wish\nimpatiently for his dinner, and to consider where he could get the\nnicest pies, pastry, ices, and jellies, while he smacked his lips at\nthe very thoughts of them. I think he must have been first cousin to\nPeter Grey, but that is not perfectly certain.\n\nWhenever Master No-book spoke, it was always to ask for something, and\nyou might continually hear him say, in a whining tone of voice, \"Papa!\nmay I take this piece of cake? Aunt Sarah! will you give me an apple?\nMama! do send me the whole of that plum-pudding!\" Indeed, very\nfrequently when he did not get permission to gormandize, this naughty\nglutton helped himself without leave. Even his dreams were like his\nwaking hours, for he had often a horrible night-mare about lessons,\nthinking that he was smothered with Greek Lexicons, or pelted out of the\nschool with a shower of English Grammars, while one night, he fancied\nhimself sitting down to devour an enormous plum-cake, and that all on a\nsudden it became transformed into a Latin Dictionary!\n\nOne afternoon, Master No-book, having played truant all day from school,\nwas lolling on his mama's best sofa in the drawing-room, with his\nleather boots tucked up on the satin cushions, and nothing to do but to\nsuck a few oranges, and nothing to think of but how much sugar to put\nupon them, when suddenly an event took place which filled him with\nastonishment.\n\nA sound of soft music stole into the room, becoming louder and louder\nthe longer he listened, till at length, in a few moments afterwards, a\nlarge hole burst open in the wall of his room, and there stepped into\nhis presence, two magnificent fairies, just arrived from their castle in\nthe air, to pay him a visit. They had travelled all the way on purpose\nto have some conversation with Master No-book, and immediately\nintroduced themselves in a very ceremonious manner.\n\nThe fairy Do-nothing was gorgeously dressed with a wreath of flaming gas\nround her head, a robe of gold tissue, a necklace of rubies, and a\nbouquet in her hand, of glittering diamonds. Her cheeks were rouged to\nthe very eyes,--her teeth were set in gold, and her hair was of a most\nbrilliant purple; in short, so fine and fashionable looking a fairy\nnever was seen in a drawing-room before.\n\nThe fairy Teach-all, who followed next, was simply dressed in white\nmuslin, with bunches of natural flowers in her light brown hair, and she\ncarried in her hand a few neat small books, which Master No-book looked\nat with a shudder of aversion.\n\nThe two fairies now informed him, that they very often invited large\nparties of children, to spend some time at their palaces, but as they\nlived in quite an opposite direction, it was necessary for their young\nguests to choose which it would be best to visit first; therefore now\nthey had come to inquire of Master No-book, whom he thought it would be\nmost agreeable to accompany on the present occasion.\n\n\"In my house,\" said the fairy Teach-all, speaking with a very sweet\nsmile, and a soft, pleasing voice, \"you shall be taught to find pleasure\nin every sort of exertion, for I delight in activity and diligence. My\nyoung friends rise at seven every morning, and amuse themselves with\nworking in a beautiful garden of flowers,--rearing whatever fruit they\nwish to eat,--visiting among the poor,--associating pleasantly\ntogether,--studying the arts and sciences,--and learning to know the\nworld in which they live, and to fulfil the purposes for which they have\nbeen brought into it. In short, all our amusements tend to some useful\nobject, either for our own improvement or the good of others, and you\nwill grow wiser, better, and happier every day you remain in the Palace\nof Knowledge.\"\n\n\"But in Castle Needless where I live,\" interrupted the fairy Do-nothing,\nrudely pushing her companion aside, with an angry contemptuous look, \"we\nnever think of exerting ourselves for anything. You may put your head in\nyour pocket, and your hands in your sides as long as you choose to\nstay. No one is ever even asked a question, that he may be spared the\ntrouble of answering. We lead the most fashionable life that can be\nimagined, for nobody speaks to anybody! Each of my visitors is quite an\nexclusive, and sits with his back to as many of the company as possible,\nin the most comfortable arm-chair that can be imagined. There, if you\nare only so good as to take the trouble of wishing for anything, it is\nyours, without even turning an eye round to look where it comes from.\nDresses are provided of the most magnificent kind, which go on of\nthemselves, without your having the smallest annoyance with either\nbuttons or strings,--games which you can play without an effort of\nthought,--and dishes dressed by a French cook, smoking hot and hot under\nyour nose, from morning till night,--while any rain we have, is either\nmade of cherry brandy, lemonade, or lavender water,--and in winter it\ngenerally snows iced-punch for an hour during the forenoon.\"\n\nNobody need be told which fairy Master No-book preferred; and quite\ncharmed at his own good fortune in receiving so agreeable an invitation,\nhe eagerly gave his hand to the splendid new acquaintance, who promised\nhim so much pleasure and ease, and gladly proceeded, in a carriage lined\nwith velvet, stuffed with downy pillows, and drawn by milk-white swans,\nto that magnificent residence Castle Needless, which was lighted by a\nthousand windows during the day, and by a million of lamps every night.\n\nHere Master No-book enjoyed a constant holiday and a constant feast,\nwhile a beautiful lady, covered with jewels, was ready to tell him\nstories from morning till night, and servants waited to pick up his\nplaythings if they fell, or to draw out his purse or his\npocket-handkerchief when he wished to use them.\n\nThus Master No-book lay dozing for hours and days on rich embroidered\ncushions, never stirring from his place, but admiring the view of trees\ncovered with the richest burned almonds, grottoes of sugar-candy, a jet\nd'eau of champagne, a wide sea which tasted of sugar instead of salt,\nand a bright clear pond, filled with gold-fish, that let themselves be\ncaught whenever he pleased. Nothing could be more complete, and yet,\nvery strange to say, Master No-book did not seem particularly happy!\nThis appears exceedingly unreasonable, when so much trouble was taken to\nplease him; but the truth is, that every day he became more fretful and\npeevish. No sweetmeats were worth the trouble of eating, nothing was\npleasant to play at, and in the end he wished it were possible to sleep\nall day, as well as all night.\n\nNot a hundred miles from the fairy Do-nothing's palace, there lived a\nmost cruel monster called the giant Snap-'em-up, who looked, when he\nstood up, like the tall steeple of a great church, raising his head so\nhigh, that he could peep over the loftiest mountains, and was obliged to\nclimb up a ladder to comb his own hair.\n\nEvery morning regularly, this prodigiously great giant walked round the\nworld before breakfast for an appetite, after which, he made tea in a\nlarge lake, used the sea as a slop-basin, and boiled his kettle on Mount\nVesuvius. He lived in great style, and his dinners were most\nmagnificent, consisting very often of an elephant roasted whole, ostrich\npatties, a tiger smothered in onions, stewed lions, and whale soup; but\nfor a side-dish his greatest favourite consisted of little boys, as fat\nas possible, fried in crumbs of bread, with plenty of pepper and salt.\n\nNo children were so well fed, or in such good condition for eating, as\nthose in the fairy Do-nothing's garden, who was a very particular friend\nof the great Snap-'em-up's, and who sometimes laughingly said she would\ngive him a license, and call her own garden his \"preserve,\" because she\nallowed him to help himself, whenever he pleased, to as many of her\nvisitors as he chose, without taking the trouble even to count them,\nand in return for such extreme civility, the giant very frequently\ninvited her to dinner.\n\nSnap-'em-up's favourite sport was, to see how many brace of little boys\nhe could bag in a morning; so in passing along the streets, he peeped\ninto all the drawing-rooms without having occasion to get upon tiptoe,\nand picked up every young gentleman who was idly looking out of the\nwindows, and even a few occasionally who were playing truant from\nschool, but busy children seemed always somehow quite out of his reach.\n\nOne day, when Master No-book felt even more lazy, more idle, and more\nmiserable than ever, he lay beside a perfect mountain of toys and cakes,\nwondering what to wish for next, and hating the very sight of everything\nand everybody. At last he gave so loud a yawn of weariness and disgust,\nthat his jaw very nearly fell out of joint, and then he sighed so\ndeeply, that the giant Snap-'em-up heard the sound as he passed along\nthe road after breakfast, and instantly stepped into the garden, with\nhis glass at his eye, to see what was the matter. Immediately on\nobserving a large, fat, over-grown boy, as round as a dumpling, lying on\na bed of roses, he gave a cry of delight, followed by a gigantic peal of\nlaughter, which was heard three miles off, and picking up Master No-book\nbetween his finger and his thumb, with a pinch that very nearly broke\nhis ribs, he carried him rapidly towards his own castle, while the fairy\nDo-nothing laughingly shook her head as he passed, saying, \"That little\nman does me great credit!--he has only been fed for a week, and is as\nfat already as a prize ox! What a dainty morsel he will be! When do you\ndine to-day, in case I should have time to look in upon you?\"\n\nOn reaching home, the giant immediately hung up Master No-book by the\nhair of his head, on a prodigious hook in the larder, having first taken\nsome large lumps of nasty suet, forcing them down his throat to make him\nbecome still fatter, and then stirring the fire, that he might be\nalmost melted with heat, to make his liver grow larger. On a shelf quite\nnear, Master No-book perceived the dead bodies of six other boys, whom\nhe remembered to have seen fattening in the fairy Do-nothing's garden,\nwhile he recollected how some of them had rejoiced at the thoughts of\nleading a long, useless, idle life, with no one to please but\nthemselves.\n\nThe enormous cook now seized hold of Master No-book, brandishing her\nknife, with an aspect of horrible determination, intending to kill him,\nwhile he took the trouble of screaming and kicking in the most desperate\nmanner, when the giant turned gravely round and said, that as pigs were\nconsidered a much greater dainty when whipped to death than killed in\nany other way, he meant to see whether children might not be improved by\nit also; therefore she might leave that great hog of a boy till he had\ntime to try the experiment, especially as his own appetite would be\nimproved by the exercise. This was a dreadful prospect for the unhappy\nprisoner; but meantime it prolonged his life a few hours, as he was\nimmediately hung up again in the larder, and left to himself. There, in\ntorture of mind and body,--like a fish upon a hook,--the wretched boy\nbegan at last to reflect seriously upon his former ways, and to consider\nwhat a happy home he might have had, if he could only have been\nsatisfied with business and pleasure succeeding each other, like day and\nnight, while lessons might have come in, as a pleasant sauce to his\nplay-hours, and his play-hours as a sauce to his lessons.\n\nIn the midst of many reflections, which were all very sensible, though\nrather too late. Master No-book's attention became attracted by the\nsound of many voices laughing, talking, and singing, which caused him to\nturn his eyes in a new direction, when, for the first time, he observed\nthat the fairy Teach-all's garden lay upon a beautiful sloping bank not\nfar off. There a crowd of merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked boys, were busily\nemployed, and seemed happier than the day was long; while poor Master\nNo-book watched them during his own miserable hours, envying the\nenjoyment with which they raked the flower-borders, gathered the fruit,\ncarried baskets of vegetables to the poor, worked with carpenters'\ntools, drew pictures, shot with bows and arrows, played at cricket, and\nthen sat in the sunny arbours learning their tasks, or talking agreeably\ntogether, till at length, a dinner-bell having been rung, the whole\nparty sat merrily down with hearty appetites, and cheerful good-humour,\nto an entertainment of plain roast meat and pudding, where the fairy\nTeach-all presided herself, and helped her guests moderately, to as much\nas was good for each.\n\nLarge tears rolled down the cheeks of Master No-book while watching this\nscene; and remembering that if he had known what was best for him, he\nmight have been as happy as the happiest of these excellent boys,\ninstead of suffering ennui and weariness, as he had done at the fairy\nDo-nothing's, ending in a miserable death; but his attention was soon\nafter most alarmingly roused by hearing the giant Snap-'em-up again in\nconversation with his cook, who said, that if he wished for a good large\ndish of scolloped children at dinner, it would be necessary to catch a\nfew more, as those he had already provided would scarcely be a mouthful.\n\nAs the giant kept very fashionable hours, and always waited dinner for\nhimself till nine o'clock, there was still plenty of time; so, with a\nloud grumble about the trouble, he seized a large basket in his hand,\nand set off at a rapid pace towards the fairy Teach-all's garden. It was\nvery seldom that Snap-'em-up ventured to think of foraging in this\ndirection, as he had never once succeeded in carrying off a single\ncaptive from the enclosure, it was so well fortified and so bravely\ndefended; but on this occasion, being desperately hungry, he felt as\nbold as a lion, and walked, with outstretched hands, straight towards\nthe fairy Teach-all's dinner-table, taking such prodigious strides, that\nhe seemed almost as if he would trample on himself.\n\nA cry of consternation arose the instant this tremendous giant appeared;\nand as usual on such occasions, when he had made the same attempt\nbefore, a dreadful battle took place. Fifty active little boys bravely\nflew upon the enemy, armed with their dinner knives, and looked like a\nnest of hornets, stinging him in every direction, till he roared with\npain, and would have run away, but the fairy Teach-all, seeing his\nintention, rushed forward with the carving knife, and brandishing it\nhigh over her head, she most courageously stabbed him to the heart!\n\nIf a great mountain had fallen in the earth, it would have seemed like\nnothing in comparison of the giant Snap-'em-up, who crushed two or three\nhouses to powder beneath him, and upset several fine monuments that were\nto have made people remembered for ever; but all this would have seemed\nscarcely worth mentioning, had it not been for a still greater event\nwhich occurred on the occasion, no less than the death of the fairy\nDo-nothing, who had been indolently looking on at this great battle,\nwithout taking the trouble to interfere, or even to care who was\nvictorious, but, being also lazy about running away, when the giant\nfell, his sword came with so violent a stroke on her head, that she\ninstantly expired.\n\nThus, luckily for the whole world, the fairy Teach-all got possession of\nimmense property, which she proceeded without delay to make the best use\nof in her power.\n\nIn the first place, however, she lost no time in liberating Master\nNo-book from his hook in the larder, and gave him a lecture on activity,\nmoderation, and good conduct, which he never afterwards forgot; and it\nwas astonishing to see the change that took place immediately in his\nwhole thoughts and actions. From this very hour, Master No-book became\nthe most diligent, active, happy boy in the fairy Teach-all's garden;\nand on returning home a month afterwards, he astonished all the masters\nat school by his extraordinary reformation. The most difficult lessons\nwere a pleasure to him,--he scarcely ever stirred without a book in his\nhand,--never lay on a sofa again,--would scarcely even sit on a chair\nwith a back to it, but preferred a three-legged stool,--detested\nholidays,--never thought any exertion a trouble,--preferred climbing\nover the top of a hill to creeping round the bottom,--always ate the\nplainest food in very small quantities,--joined a Temperance\nSociety!-and never tasted a morsel till he had worked very hard and got\nan appetite.\n\nNot long after this, an old uncle, who had formerly been ashamed of\nMaster No-book's indolence and gluttony, became so pleased at the\nwonderful change, that, on his death, he left him a magnificent estate,\ndesiring that he should take his name; therefore, instead of being any\nlonger one of the No-book family, he is now called Sir Timothy\nBluestocking,--a pattern to the whole country round, for the good he\ndoes to every one, and especially for his extraordinary activity,\nappearing as if he could do twenty things at once. Though generally very\ngood-natured and agreeable, Sir Timothy is occasionally observed in a\nviolent passion, laying about him with his walking-stick in the most\nterrific manner, and beating little boys within an inch of their lives;\nbut on inquiry, it invariably appears that he has found them out to be\nlazy, idle, or greedy, for all the industrious boys in the parish are\nsent to get employment from him, while he assures them that they are far\nhappier breaking stones on the road, than if they were sitting idly in a\ndrawing-room with nothing to do. Sir Timothy cares very little for\npoetry in general; but the following are his favourite verses, which he\nhas placed over the chimney-piece at a school that he built for the\npoor, and every scholar is obliged, the very day he begins his\neducation, to learn them:--\n\n  Some people complain they have nothing to do,\n  And time passes slowly away;\n  They saunter about with no object in view,\n  And long for the end of the day.\n\n  In vain are the trifles and toys they desire,\n  For nothing they truly enjoy;\n  Of trifles, and toys, and amusements they tire,\n  For want of some useful employ.\n\n  Although for transgression the ground was accursed,\n  Yet gratefully man must allow,\n  'Twas really a blessing which doom'd him at first,\n  To live by the sweat of his brow.\n\n                                        Nursery Rhymes.\n\n\"Thank you, a hundred times over, uncle David!\" said Harry, when the\nstory was finished. \"I shall take care not to be found hanging any day\non a hook in the larder! Certainly, Frank, you must have spent a month\nwith the good fairy; and I hope she will some day invite me to be made a\nscholar of too, for Laura and I still belong to the No-book family.\"\n\n\"It is very important. Harry, to choose the best course from the\nbeginning,\" observed Lady Harriet. \"Good or bad habits grow stronger and\nstronger every minute, as if an additional string were tied on daily, to\nkeep us in the road where we walked the day before; so those who mistake\nthe path of duty at first, find hourly increasing difficulty in turning\nround.\"\n\n\"But grandmama!\" said Frank, \"you have put up some finger-posts to\ndirect us right; and whenever I see 'no passage this way,' we shall\nwheel about directly.\"\n\n\"As Mrs. Crabtree has not tapped at the door yet, I shall describe the\nprogress of a wise and a foolish man, to see which Harry and you would\nprefer copying,\" replied Lady Harriet, smiling. \"The fool begins, when\nhe is young, with hating lessons, lying long in bed, and spending all\nhis money on trash. Any books he will consent to read, are never about\nwhat is true or important; but he wastes all his time and thoughts on\nsilly stories that never could have happened. Thus he neglects to learn\nwhat was done, and thought, by all the great and good men who really\nlived in former times, while even his Bible, if he has one, grows dusty\non the shelf. After so bad a beginning, he grows up with no useful or\ninteresting knowledge; therefore his whole talk is to describe his own\nhorses, his own dogs, his own guns, and his own exploits; boasting of\nwhat a high wall his horse can leap over, the number of little birds he\ncan shoot in a day, and how many bottles of wine he can swallow without\ntumbling under the table. Thus, 'glorying in his shame,' he thinks\nhimself a most wonderful person, not knowing that men are born to do\nmuch better things than merely to find selfish pleasure and amusement\nfor themselves. Presently he grows old, gouty, and infirm--no longer\nable to do such prodigious achievements; therefore now his great delight\nis, to sit with his feet upon the fender, at a club all day, telling\nwhat a famous rider, shooter, and drinker, he was long ago; but nobody\ncares to hear such old stories; therefore he is called a 'proser,' and\nevery person avoids him. It is no wonder a man talks about himself, if\nhe has never read or thought about any one else. But at length his\nprecious time has all been wasted, and his last hour comes, during which\nhe can have nothing to look back upon but a life of folly and guilt. He\nsees no one around who loves him, or will weep over his grave; and when\nhe looks forward, it is towards an eternal world which he has never\nprepared to enter, and of which he knows nothing.\"\n\n\"What a terrible picture, grandmama!\" said Frank, rather gravely. \"I\nhope there are not many people like that, or it would be very sad to\nmeet with them. Now pray let us have a pleasanter description of the\nsort of persons you would like Harry and me to become.\"\n\n\"The first foundation of all is, as you already know, Frank, to pray\nthat you may be put in the right course and kept in it, for of ourselves\nwe are so sinful and weak that we can do no good thing. Then feeling a\nfull trust in the Divine assistance, you must begin and end every day\nwith studying your Bible, not merely reading it, but carefully\nendeavouring to understand and obey what it contains. Our leisure should\nbe bestowed on reading of wiser and better people than ourselves, which\nwill keep us humble while it instructs our understandings, and thus we\nshall be fitted to associate with persons whose society is even better\nthan books. Christians who are enlightened and sanctified in the\nknowledge of all good things, will show us an example of carefully using\nour time, which is the most valuable of all earthly possessions. If we\nwaste our money, we may perhaps get more--if we lose our health, it may\nbe restored--but time squandered on folly, must hereafter be answered\nfor, and can never be regained. Whatever be your station in life, waste\nnone of your thoughts upon fancying how much better you might have acted\nin some other person's place, but see what duties belong to that station\nin which you live, and do what that requires with activity and\ndiligence. When we are called to give an account of our stewardship, let\nus not have to confess at the last that we wasted our one talent,\nbecause we wished to have been trusted with ten; but let us prepare to\nrender up what was given to us, with joy and thankfulness, perfectly\nsatisfied that the best place in life is where God appoints, and where\nHe will guide us to a safe and peaceful end.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" added Major Graham. \"You have two eyes in your minds as well as\nin your bodies. With one of these we see all that is good or agreeable\nin our lot--with the other we see all that is unpleasant or\ndisappointing, and you may generally choose which eye to keep open. Some\nof my friends always peevishly look at the troubles and vexations they\nendure, but they might turn them into good, by considering that every\ncircumstance is sent from the same hand, with the same merciful\npurpose--to make us better now and happier hereafter.\"\n\n\"Well! my dear children,\" said Lady Harriet, \"it is time now for\nretiring to Bedfordshire; so good night.\"\n\n\"If you please, grandmama! not yet,\" asked Harry, anxiously. \"Give us\nfive minutes longer!\"\n\n\"And then in the morning you will want to remain five minutes more in\nbed. That is the way people learn to keep such dreadfully late hours at\nlast, Harry! I knew one very rich old gentleman formerly, who always\nwished to sit up a little later every night, and to get up a little\nlater in the morning, till at length, he ended by hiring a set of\nservants to rise at nine in the evening, as he did himself, and to\nremain in bed all day.\"\n\n\"People should regulate their sleep very conscientiously,\" added Major\nGraham, \"so as to waste as little time as possible; and our good king\nGeorge III. set us the example, for he remarked, that six hours in the\nnight were quite enough for a man--seven hours for a woman, and eight\nfor a fool. Or perhaps, Harry, you might like to live by Sir William\nJones' rule:\n\n  'Six hours to read, to soothing slumber seven,\n  Ten to the world allot--and all to Heaven.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE ILLUMINATION.\n\n  A neighbour's house he'd slyly pass,\n  And throw a stone to break the glass.\n\n\nOne fine morning in Charlotte Square, Peter Grey persuaded a party of\nhis companions to spend all the money they had on cakes and sugar-plums,\nto make a splendid entertainment under the trees, where they were to sit\nlike a horde of gypsies, and amuse themselves with telling fortunes to\neach other. Harry and Laura had no one with them but Betty, who gladly\njoined a group of nursery-maids at a distance, leaving them to their own\ndevices; upon which they rushed up to Peter and offered their\nassistance, subscribing all their pocket-money, and begging him to set\nforth and obtain provisions for them as well as for himself. Neither\nHarry nor Laura cared for eating the trash that was collected on this\noccasion, and would have been quite as well pleased to distribute it\namong their companions; but they both enjoyed extremely the bustle of\narranging this elegant déjeuné or \"_disjune_,\" as Peter called it. Harry\ngathered leaves off the trees to represent plates, on each of which\nPeter arranged some of the fruit or sweetmeats he had purchased, while\nthey placed benches together as a table, and borrowed Laura's white\nIndia shawl for a table-cloth.\n\n\"It looks like that grand public dinner we saw at the Assembly Rooms\none day!\" exclaimed Harry, in an ecstacy of admiration. \"We must have\nspeeches and toasts like real gentlemen and officers. Peter! if you will\nmake a fine oration, full of compliments to me, I shall say something\nwonderful about you, and then Laura must beat upon the table with a\nstick, to show that she agrees to all that we observe in praise of each\nother.\"\n\n\"Or suppose we all take the names of some great personages,\" added\nPeter, \"I shall be the Duke of Wellington, and Laura, you must be Joseph\nHume, and Harry, you are Sir Francis Burdett, that we may seem as\ndifferent as possible; but here comes the usher of the black rod to\ndisperse us all! Mrs. Crabtree hurrying into the square, her very gown\nflaming with rage! what can be the matter! she must have smelled the\nsugar-plums a mile off! one comfort is, if Harry and Laura are taken\naway, we shall have the fewer people to divide these cakes among, and I\ncould devour every one of them, for my own share.\"\n\nBefore Peter finished speaking, Mrs. Crabtree had come close up to the\ntable, and without waiting to utter a word, or even to scold, she\ntwitched up Laura's shawl in her hand, and thus scattered the whole\nfeast in every direction on the ground, after which she trampled the\nsugar-plums and cakes into the earth, saying,\n\n\"I knew how it would be, as soon as I saw whose company you were in,\nMaster Harry! Peter Grey is the father of mischief! he ought to be put\ninto the monkey's cage at the GEOlogical gardens! I would not be your\nmaid, Master Grey, for a hundred a-year.\"\n\n\"You would need to buy a thrashing machine immediately,\" said Peter,\nlaughing; \"what a fine time I should have of it! you would scarcely\nallow me, I suppose, to blow my porridge! how long would it take you,\nMrs. Crabtree, to make quite a perfectly good boy of me? Perhaps a\nmonth, do you think? or to make me as good as Frank, it might possibly\nrequire six weeks.\"\n\n\"Six weeks!\" answered Mrs. Crabtree; \"six years, or sixty, would be too\nshort. You are no more like Mr. Frank than a shilling is to a guinea, or\na wax light to a dip. If the news were told that you had been a good boy\nfor a single day, the very _statutes_ in the streets would come running\nalong to see the wonder. No! no! I have observed many surprising things\nin my day, but them great pyramuses in Egypt will turn upside down\nbefore you turn like Mr. Frank.\"\n\nSome days after this adventure of Harry and Laura's, there arrived\nnewspapers from London containing accounts of a great battle which had\nbeen fought abroad. On that occasion the British troops of course\nperformed prodigies of valour, and completely conquered the enemy, in\nconsequence of which, it was ordered by government, that, in every town,\nand every village, and every house throughout the whole kingdom, there\nshould be a grand illumination.\n\nNeither Harry nor Laura had ever heard of such a thing as an\nillumination before, and they were full of curiosity to know what it was\nlike; but their very faces became lighted up with joy, when Major Graham\ndescribed that they would see crowds of candles flaming in every window,\ntar-barrels blazing on every hill, flambeaux glaring at the doors, and\ntransparencies, fire-works, and coloured lamps shining in all the\nstreets.\n\n\"How delightful! and walking out in the dark to see it,\" cried Harry;\n\"that will be best of all! oh! and a whole holiday! I hardly know\nwhether I am in my right wits, or my wrong wits, for joy! I wish we\ngained a victory every day!\"\n\n\"What a warrior you would be, Harry! Cæsar was nothing to you,\" said\nFrank. \"We might be satisfied with one good battle in a year,\nconsidering how many are killed and wounded.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I hope all the wounded soldiers will recover.\"\n\n\"Or get pensions,\" added uncle David. \"It is a grand sight, Frank, to\nsee a whole nation rejoicing at once! In general, when you walk out and\nmeet fifty persons in the street, they are all thinking of fifty\ndifferent things, and each intent on some business of his own, but on\nthis occasion all are of one mind and one heart.\"\n\nFrank and Harry were allowed to nail a dozen of little candlesticks upon\neach window in the house, which delighted them exceedingly, and then,\nbefore every pane of glass, they placed a tall candle, impatiently\nlonging for the time when these were to be illuminated. Laura was\nallowed to carry a match, and assist in lighting them, but in the excess\nof her joy, she very nearly made a bonfire of herself, as her frock took\nfire, and would soon have been in a blaze, if Frank had not hastily\nseized a large rug and rolled it round her.\n\nIn every house within sight, servants and children were to be seen\nhurrying about with burning matches, while hundreds of lights blazed up\nin a moment, looking as if all the houses in town had taken fire.\n\n\"Such a waste of candles!\" said Mrs. Crabtree, angrily; \"can't people be\nhappy in the dark!\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Crabtree!\" answered Frank, laughing. \"They cannot be happy in\nthe dark! People's spirits are always in exact proportion to the number\nof lights. If you ever feel dull with one candle, light another; and if\nthat does not do, try a third, or a fourth, till you feel merry and\ncheerful. We must not let you be candle-snuffer to-night, or you will be\nputting them all out. You would snuff out the sun itself, to save a\nshilling.\"\n\n\"The windows might perhaps be broken,\" added Laura; \"for whatever pane\nof glass does not exhibit a candle, is to have a stone sent through it.\nHarry says the mob are all glaziers, who break them on purpose to mend\nthe damage next day, which they will be paid handsomely for doing.\"\n\nThere were many happy, joyous faces, to be seen that evening in the\nstreets, admiring the splendid illumination; but the merriest party of\nall, was composed of Frank, Harry, and Laura, under the command of uncle\nDavid, who had lately suffered from a severe fit of the gout; but it\nseemed to have left him this night, in honour of the great victory, when\nhe appeared quite as much a boy as either of his two companions. For\nmany hours they walked about in the streets, gazing up at the glittering\nwindows, some of which looked as if a constellation of stars had come\ndown for a night to adorn them; and others were filled with the most\nbeautiful pictures of Britannia carrying the world on her shoulders; or\nMars showering down wreaths of laurel on the Duke of Wellington, while\nvictory was sitting at his feet, and fame blowing a trumpet at his ear.\nHarry thought these paintings finer than any he had ever seen before,\nand stood for some moments entranced with admiration, on beholding a\nrepresentation in red, blue, yellow, and black, of Europe, Asia, Africa,\nand America, all doing homage to St. George mounted on a dragon, which\nbreathed out fire and smoke like a steam-boat. Nothing, however,\noccasioned the party such a burst of delightful surprise, as when they\nfirst beheld the line of blazing windows more than a mile long, from the\nbottom of the Canongate to the highest pinnacle of the Castle, where\nthey seemed almost to meet the stars shining above, in their perpetual\nglory. \"You see,\" remarked Major Graham, when he pointed them out to his\nyoung companions, \"there is a fit emblem of the difference between earth\nand heaven. These lights nearer and brighter to us at present; but when\nthey have blazed and glittered for one little hour, they come to an end;\nwhile those above, which we see so dimly now, will continue to shine\nfor ages and generations hereafter, till time itself is no more.\"\n\nOccasionally, during their progress, Harry felt very indignant to\nobserve a few houses perfectly dark; and whether the family were sick,\nor out of town, or whatever the reason might be, he scarcely became\nsorry when a frequent crash might be heard, as the mob, determined to\nhave their own way this night, aimed showers of stones at the offending\nwindows, till the very frames seemed in danger of being broken. At last\nuncle David led his joyous little party into Castle Street, in which not\na light was to be seen, and every blind seemed carefully closed. A crowd\nhad assembled, with an evident intention to attack these melancholy\nhouses, when Major Graham suddenly caught hold of Harry's arm, on\nobserving that he had privately picked up a large stone, which he was in\nthe very act of throwing with his whole force at one of the defenceless\nwindows. And now the whole party stood stock still, while uncle David\nsaid in a very angry and serious voice,\n\n\"Harry! you heedless, mischievous boy! will you never learn to consider\na moment before you do what is wrong? I am exceedingly displeased with\nyou for this! What business is it of yours whether that house be lighted\nup or not?\"\n\n\"But, uncle David! surely it is very wrong not to obey the government,\nand to be happy like everybody else! Besides, you see the mob will break\nthose windows at any rate, so it is no matter if I help them.\"\n\n\"Then, for the same reason, if they were setting the house on fire, I\nsuppose you would assist the conflagration, Harry. Your excuse is a very\nbad one; and when you hear what I have to say about this house, let it\nbe a lesson for the rest of your life, never to judge hastily, nor to\nact rashly. The officer to whom it belonged, has been killed in the\ngreat battle abroad; and while we are rejoicing in the victory that his\nbravery helped to gain, his widow and children are weeping within those\nwalls, for the husband and father who lies buried on a foreign shore.\nThink what a contrast these shouts of joy must be to their grief.\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle David! how sorry I am!\" said Harry. \"I deserve to go home\nthis moment, and not to see a candle again for a week. It was very wrong\nof me indeed. I shall walk all the way home, with my eyes shut, if you\nwill only excuse me.\"\n\n\"No, no, Harry! that is not necessary! If the eyes of your mind are\nopen, to see that you have acted amiss, then try to behave better in\nfuture. When people are happy themselves, they are too apt to forget\nthat others may be in distress, and often feel quite surprised and\nprovoked at those who appear melancholy; but our turn must come like\ntheirs. Life is made up of sunshine and shadow, both of which are sent\nfor our good, and neither of them last, in this world, for ever; but we\nshould borrow part of our joys, and part of our sorrows, from sympathy\nwith all those we see or know, which will moderate the excess of\nwhatever is our own portion in life.\"\n\nAt this moment, the mob, which had been gradually increasing, gave a\ntremendous shout, and were on the point of throwing a torrent of stones\nat the dark, mournful house, which had made so narrow an escape from\nHarry's vengeance, when Major Graham, forgetting his gout, hastily\nsprung upon a lamp-post, and calling for attention, he made a speech\nto the crowd, telling of the brave Captain D---- who had died for his\ncountry, covered with wounds, and that his mourning family was assembled\nin that house. Instantly the mob became as silent and motionless as if\nthey had themselves been turned into stones; after which they gradually\nstole away, with downcast eyes, and mournful countenances; while it is\nbelieved that some riotous people, who had been loudest and fiercest at\nfirst, afterwards stood at the top of the little street like sentinels,\nfor more than an hour, to warn every one who passed, that he should go\nsilently along, in respect for the memory of a brave and good officer.\nNot another shout was heard in the neighbourhood that night; and many a\nmerry laugh was suddenly checked from reverence for the memory of the\ndead, and the sorrow of the living; while some spectators remarked, with\na sigh of melancholy reflection, that men must ever join trembling with\ntheir mirth, because even in the midst of life they are in death.\n\n\"If we feel so much sorrow for this one officer and his family, it\nshows,\" said Frank, \"what a dreadful thing war is, which costs the lives\nof thousands and tens of thousands in every campaign, by sickness and\nfatigue, and the other sources of misery that accompany every army.\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank! and yet there has scarcely been a year on earth, while the\nworld has existed, without fighting in some country or another, for,\nsince the time when Cain killed Abel, men have been continually\ndestroying each other. Animals only fight in temporary irritation when\nthey are hungry, but pride, ambition, and folly of every kind, have\ncaused men to hate and massacre each other. Even religion itself has\ncaused the fiercest and most bloody conflicts, though, if that were only\nunderstood and obeyed as it ought to be, the great truths of Scripture\nwould produce peace on earth, and good-will among all the children of\nmen.\"\n\nThe whole party had been standing for some minutes opposite to the\npost-office, which looked like a rainbow of coloured lamps, and Harry\nwas beginning, for the twentieth time, to try if he could count how many\nthere were, when Major Graham felt something twitching hold of his coat\npocket behind, and on wheeling suddenly round, he perceived a little\nboy, not much older than Harry, darting rapidly off in another\ndirection, carrying his own purse and pocket-handkerchief in his hand.\nBeing still rather lame, and unable to move very fast, Major Graham\ncould only vociferate at the very top of his voice, \"Stop thief! stop\nthief!\" but not a constable appeared in sight, so the case seemed\ndesperate, and the money lost for ever, when Frank observed also what\nhad occurred, and being of an active spirit, he flew after the young\nthief, followed closely by Harry. An eager race ensued, up one street,\nand down another, with marvellous rapidity, while Frank was so evidently\ngaining ground, that the thief at last became terrified, and threw away\nthe purse, hoping thus to end the chase; but neither of his pursuers\npaused a moment to pick it up, they were so intent upon capturing the\nlittle culprit himself. At length Frank sprung forward and caught him by\nthe collar, when a fierce conflict ensued, during which the young thief\nwas so ingenious, that he nearly slipped his arms out of his coat, and\nwould have made his escape, leaving a very tattered garment in their\nhands, if Harry had not observed this trick, and held him by the hair,\nwhich, as it was not a wig, he could not so easily throw off.\n\nAt this moment, a large coarse ruffianly-looking man hurried up to the\nparty, evidently intending to rescue the little pick-pocket from their\ncustody; so Frank called loudly for help, while several police-officers\nwho had been sent by Major Graham, came racing along the street,\nspringing their rattles, and vociferating, \"Stop thief!\"\n\nNow, the boy struggled more violently than ever to disentangle himself,\nbut Frank and Harry grasped hold of their prisoner, as if they had been\na couple of Bow Street officers, till at length the tall fierce man\nthought it time to be off, though not before he had given Harry a blow\non the face, that caused him to reel back, and fall prostrate on the\npavement.\n\n\"There's a brave little gentleman!\" said one of the constables, helping\nhim up, while another secured the thief. \"You ought to be knighted for\nfighting so well! This boy you have taken is a sad fellow! He broke his\npoor mother's heart a year since by his wicked ways, and I have long\nwished to catch him. A few weeks on the tread-mill now, may save him\nfrom the gallows in future.\"\n\n\"He seems well practised in his business,\" observed Major Graham. \"I\nalmost deserved; however, to lose my pocket-book for bringing it out in\na night of so much crowding and confusion. Some lucky person will be all\nthe richer, though I fear it is totally lost to me.\"\n\n\"But here is your pocket-handkerchief, uncle David, if you mean to shed\nany tears for your misfortune,\" whispered Laura; \"how very lucky that\nyou felt it going!\"\n\n\"Yes, and very surprising too, for the trick was so cleverly executed!\nThat little rascal might steal the teeth out of one's head, without\nbeing noticed! When I was in India, the thieves there were so expert\nthat they really could draw the sheets from under a person sleeping in\nbed, without disturbing his slumbers.\"\n\n\"With me, any person could do that, because I sleep so very soundly,\"\nobserved Frank. \"You might beat a military drum at my ear, as they do in\nthe boy's sleeping rooms at Sandhurst, and it would not have the\nsmallest effect. I scarcely think that even a gong would do!\"\n\n\"How very different from me,\" replied Laura. \"Last night I was awakened\nby the scratching of a mouse nibbling in the wainscoat, and soon after\nit ran across my face.\"\n\n\"Then pray sleep to-night with your mouth open, and a piece of toasted\ncheese in it, to catch the mouse,\" said Major Graham. \"That is the best\ntrap I know!\"\n\n\"Uncle David,\" asked Frank, as they proceeded along the street, \"if\nthere is any hope of that wicked boy being reformed, will you try to\nhave him taught better? Being so very young, he must have learned from\nolder people to steal.\"\n\n\"Certainly he must! It is melancholy to know how carefully mere children\nare trained to commit the very worst crimes, and how little the mind of\nany young boy can be a match for the cunning of old, experienced\nvillains like those who lead them astray. When once a child falls into\nthe snare of such practised offenders, escape becomes as impossible as\nthat of a bird from a limed twig.\"\n\n\"So I believe,\" replied Frank. \"Grandmama told me that the very youngest\nchildren of poor people, when first sent to school in London, are often\nwaylaid by those old women who sell apples in the street, and who\npretend to be so good-natured that they make them presents of fruit. Of\ncourse these are very acceptable, but after some time, those wicked\nwretches propose that the child in return shall bring them a book, or\nanything he can pick up at home, which shall be paid for in apples and\npears. Few little boys have sufficient firmness not to comply, whether\nthey like it or not, and after that the case is almost hopeless,\nbecause, whenever the poor victim hesitates to steal more, those cruel\nwomen threaten to inform the parents of his misconduct, which terrifies\nthe boy into doing anything rather than be found out.\"\n\n\"Oh, how dreadful!\" exclaimed Laura. \"It all begins so smoothly! No poor\nlittle boy could suspect any danger, and then he becomes a hardened\nthief at once.\"\n\n\"Grandmama says, too, that pick-pockets, in London used to have the\nstuffed figure of a man hung from the roof of their rooms, and covered\nall over with bells, for the boys to practise upon, and no one was\nallowed to attempt stealing on the streets, till he could pick the\npocket of this dangling effigy, without ringing one of the many bells\nwith which it was ornamented.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Harry, \"when the young thieves saw that figure hanging\nin the air, it might have reminded them how soon they would share the\nsame fate. Even crows take warning when they see a brother crow hanging\ndead in a field.\"\n\n\"It is a curious thing of crows, Harry, that they certainly punish\nthieves among themselves,\" observed Major Graham. \"In a large rookery,\nsome outcasts are frequently to be observed living apart from the rest,\nand not allowed to associate with their more respectable brethren. I\nremember hearing formerly, that in the great rookery at --------, when\nall the other birds were absent, one solitary crow was observed to\nlinger behind, stealing materials for his nest from those around, but\nnext morning a prodigious uproar was heard among the trees,--the cawing\nbecame so vociferous, that evidently several great orators were\nagitating the crowd, till suddenly the enraged crows flew in a body upon\nthe nest of their dishonest associate, and tore it in pieces.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Frank. \"I do like to hear about all the odd ways of birds\nand animals! Grandmama mentioned lately, that, if you catch a crow, and\nfasten him down with his back to the ground, he makes such an outcry,\nthat all his black brothers come wheeling about the place, till one of\nthem at last alights to help him. Immediately the treacherous prisoner\ngrapples hold of his obliging friend, and never afterwards lets him\nescape; so, by fastening down one after another, we might entrap the\nwhole rookery.\"\n\n\"I shall try it some day!\" exclaimed Harry, eagerly. \"What fun to hear\nthem all croaking and cawing!\"\n\n\"We shall be croaking ourselves soon with colds, if we do not hurry\nhome,\" added uncle David. \"There is not a thimbleful of light remaining,\nand your grandmama will be impatient to hear all the news. This has\nreally been a most adventurous night, and I am sure none of us will soon\nforget it.\"\n\nWhen the whole party entered the drawing-room, in a blaze of spirits,\nall speaking at once, to tell Lady Harriet what had occurred, Mrs.\nCrabtree, who was waiting to take a couple of little prisoners off to\nbed, suddenly gave an exclamation of astonishment and dismay when she\nlooked at Harry, who now, for the first time since the robber had\nknocked him down, approached the light, when he did, to be sure, appear\na most terrible spectacle! His jacket was bespattered with mud, his\nshirt-frill torn and bloody, one eye almost swelled out of his head, and\nthe side of his face quite black and blue.\n\n\"What mischief have you been in now, Mr. Harry?\" cried Mrs. Crabtree,\nangrily; \"you will not leave a whole bone in your body, nor a whole\nshirt in your drawer!\"\n\n\"These are honourable scars, Mrs. Crabtree,\" interrupted Major Graham.\n\"Harry has been fighting my battles, and gained a great victory! we must\nilluminate the nursery!\"\n\nUncle David then told the whole story, with many droll remarks, about\nhis purse having been stolen, and said that, as Harry never complained\nof being hurt, he never supposed that anything of the kind could have\noccurred; but he felt very much pleased to observe how well a certain\nyoung gentleman was able to bear pain, as boys must expect hard blows in\nthe world, when they had to fight their way through life, therefore it\nwas well for them to give as few as they could, and to bear with\nfortitude what fell to their own share. Uncle David slyly added, that\nperhaps Harry put up with these things all the better for having so much\npractice in the nursery.\n\nMrs. Crabtree seemed rather proud of Harry's manly spirit, and treated\nhim with a little more respect than usual, saying, she would fetch him\nsome hot water to foment his face, if he would go straight up stairs\nwith Laura. Now, it very seldom happened, that Harry went straight\nanywhere, for he generally swung down the bannisters again, or took a\nleap over any thing he saw on the way, or got upon some of the tables\nand jumped off, but this night he had resolutely intended marching\nsteadily up to bed, and advanced a considerable way, when a loud shout\nin the street attracted his attention. Harry stopped, and it was\nrepeated again, so seizing Laura by the hand, they flew eagerly into\nLady Harriet's dressing-room, and throwing open a window, they picked up\na couple of cloaks that were lying on a chair, and both stepped out on a\nbalcony to find out what was going on; and in case any one should see\nthem in this unusual place, Harry quietly shut the window down,\nintending to remain only one single minute. Minutes run very fast away\nwhen people are amused, and nothing could be more diverting than the\nsight they now beheld, for at this moment a grand crash exploded of\nsquibs and rockets from the Castle-hill, which looked so beautiful in\nthe dark, that it seemed impossible to think of anything else. Some flew\nhigh in the air, and then burst into the appearance of twenty fiery\nserpents falling from the sky, others assumed a variety of colours, and\ndropped like flying meteors, looking as if the stars were all learning\nto dance, while many rushed into the air and disappeared, leaving not a\ntrace behind. Harry and Laura stood perfectly entranced with admiration\nand delight, till the fire-works neither burst, cracked, nor exploded\nany more.\n\nA ballad-singer next attracted their notice, singing the tune of \"Meet\nme by moonlight,\" and afterwards Laura shewed Harry the constellation of\nOrion mentioned in the Bible, which, besides the Great Bear, was the\nonly one she had the slightest acquaintance with. Neither of them had\never observed the Northern Lights so brilliant before, and now they felt\nalmost alarmed to see them shooting like lances of fire across the sky,\nand glittering with many bright colours, like a rainbow, while Laura\nremembered her grandmama mentioning some days ago, that the poor natives\nof Greenland believe these are the spirits of their fathers going forth\nto battle.\n\nMeantime, Lady Harriet called Frank, as usual, to his evening prayers\nand reading in her dressing-room, where it was well known that they were\non no account to be disturbed. After having read a chapter, and talked\nvery seriously about all it was intended to teach, they had begun to\ndiscuss the prospect of Frank going abroad very soon to become a\nmidshipman, and he was wondering much where his first great shipwreck\nwould take place, and telling Lady Harriet about the loss of the\nCabalvala, where the crew lived for eight days on a barren rock, with\nnothing to eat but a cask of raspberry jam, which accidentally floated\nwithin their reach. Before Frank had finished his story, however, he\nsuddenly paused, and sprung upon his feet with an exclamation of\nastonishment, while Lady Harriet, looking hastily round in the same\ndirection, became terrified to observe a couple of faces looking in at\nthe window. It was so dark, she could not see what they were like, but a\nmoment afterwards the sash began slowly and heavily opening, after which\ntwo figures leaped into the room, while Frank flew to ring a peal at the\nbell, and Lady Harriet sunk into her own arm-chair, covering her face\nwith her hands, and nearly fainting with fright.\n\n\"Never mind, grandmama! do not be afraid! it is only us!\" cried Harry;\n\"surely you know me?\"\n\n\"You!!!\" exclaimed Lady Harriet, looking up with amazement. \"Harry and\nLaura!! impossible! how in all the world did you get here? I thought you\nwere both in bed half an hour ago! Tiresome boy! you will be the death\nof me some time or other! I wonder when you will ever pass a day without\ndeserving the bastinado!\"\n\n\"Do you not remember the good day last month, grandmama, when I had a\nsevere toothache, and sat all morning beside the fire? Nobody found\nfault with me then, and I got safe to bed, without a single Oh fie! from\nnoon till night.\"\n\n\"Wonderful, indeed! what a pity I ever allowed that tooth to be drawn,\nbut you behaved very bravely on the occasion of its being extracted. Now\ntake yourselves off! I feel perfectly certain you will tell Mrs.\nCrabtree the exact truth about where you have been, and if she punishes\nyou, remember that it is no more than you both deserve. People who\nbehave ill are their own punishers, and should be glad that some one\nwill kindly take the trouble to teach them better.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE POOR BOY.\n\n  Not all the fine things that fine people possess,\n  Should teach them the poor to despise;\n  For 'tis in good manners, and not in good dress,\n  That the truest gentility lies.\n\n\nThe following Saturday morning, Frank, Harry, and Laura were assembled\nbefore Lady Harriet's breakfast hour, talking over all their adventures\non the night of the illumination; and many a merry laugh was heard while\nuncle David cracked his jokes and told his stories, for he seemed as\nfull of fun and spirits as the youngest boy in a play-ground.\n\n\"Well, old fellow!\" said he, lifting up Harry, and suddenly seating him\non the high marble chimney-piece. \"That is the situation where the poor\nlittle dwarf, Baron Borowloski was always put by his tall wife, when she\nwished to keep him out of mischief, and I wonder Mrs. Crabtree never\nthought of the same plan for you.\"\n\n\"Luckily there is no fire, or Harry would soon be roasted for the Giant\nSnap-'em-up's dinner,\" said Frank, laughing; \"he looks up there like a\nChina Mandarin. Shake your head, Harry, and you will do quite as well!\"\n\n\"Uncle David!\" cried Harry, eagerly, \"pray let me see you stand for one\nmoment as you do at the club on a cold day, with your feet upon the rug,\nyour back to the fire, and your coat-tails under your arms! Pray do,\nfor one minute!\"\n\nUncle David did as he was asked, evidently expecting the result, which\ntook place, for Harry sprung upon his back with the agility of a monkey,\nand they went round and round the room at a full gallop, during the next\nfive minutes, while Lady Harriet said she never saw two such noisy\npeople, but it was quite the fashion now, since the king of France\ncarried his grandchildren, in the same way, every morning, a picture of\nwhich had lately been shown to her.\n\n\"Then I hope his majesty gets as good an appetite with his romp as I\nhave done,\" replied Major Graham, sitting down. \"None of your tea and\ntoast for me! that is only fit for ladies. Frank, reach me these\nbeef-steaks, and a cup of chocolate.\"\n\nHarry and Laura now planted themselves at the window, gazing at crowds\nof people who passed, while, by way of a joke, they guessed what\neverybody had come out for, and who they all were.\n\n\"There is a fat cook with a basket under her arm, going to market,\" said\nHarry. \"Did you ever observe when Mrs. Marmalade comes home, she says to\ngrandmama, 'I have desired a leg of mutton to come here, my lady! and I\ntold a goose to be over also,' as if the leg of mutton and the goose\nwalked here, arm-in-arm, of themselves.\"\n\n\"Look at those children, going to see the wild beasts,\" added Laura,\n\"and this little girl is on her way to buy a new frock. I am sure she\nneeds one! that old man is hurrying along because he is too late for the\nmail-coach; and this lady with a gown like a yellow daffodil, is going\nto take root in the Botanical Gardens!\"\n\n\"Uncle David! there is the very poorest boy I ever saw!\" cried Harry,\nturning eagerly round; \"he has been standing in the cold here, for ten\nminutes, looking the picture of misery! he wears no hat, and has pulled\nhis long lank hair to make a bow, about twenty times. Do come and look\nat him! he is very pale, and his clothes seem to have been made before\nhe began to grow, for they are so much too small, and he is making us\nmany signs to open the window. May I do it?\"\n\n\"No! no! I never give to chance beggars of that kind, especially young\nable-bodied fellows like that, because there are so many needy,\ndeserving people whom I visit, who worked as long as they could, and\nwhom I know to be sober and honest. Most of the money we scatter to\nstreet beggars goes straight to the gin-shop, and even the very youngest\nchildren will buy or steal, to get the means of becoming intoxicated.\nOnly last week, Harry, the landlord of an ale-house at Portobello was\nseen at the head of a long table, surrounded with ragged beggar boys\nabout twelve or fourteen years of age, who were all perfectly drunk, and\nprobably your friend there might be of the party.\"\n\n\"Oh no! uncle David! this boy seems quite sober and exceedingly clean,\nthough he is so very poor!\" replied Laura; \"his black trowsers are\npatched and repatched, his jacket has faded into fifty colours, and his\nshoes are mended in every direction, but still he looks almost\nrespectable. His face is so thin you might use it for a hatchet. I wish\nyou would take one little peep, for he seems so anxious to speak to us.\"\n\n\"I daresay that! we all know what the youngster has to tell! Probably a\nwife and six small children at home, or, if you like it better, he will\nbe a shipwrecked sailor at your service. I know the whole affair\nalready; but if you have sixpence to spare, Laura, come with me after\nbreakfast, and we shall bestow it on poor blind Mrs. Wilkie, who has\nbeen bed-ridden for the last ten years; or old paralytic Jemmy Dixon the\nporter, who worked hard as long as he was able. If you had twenty more\nsixpences, I could tell you of twenty more people who deserve them as\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" added Lady Harriet. \"Street beggars, who are young and able\nto work, like that boy, it is cruelty to encourage. Parents bring up\ntheir children in profligate idleness, hoping to gain more money by\nlying and cheating, than by honest industry, and they too often succeed,\nespecially when the wicked mothers also starve and disfigure these poor\ncreatures, to excite more compassion. We must relieve real distress,\nHarry, and search for it as we would for hidden treasures, because thus\nwe show our love to God and man; but a large purse with easy strings\nwill do more harm than good.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, Frank, how long I suspected that old John Davidson was\nimposing upon me?\" said Major Graham. \"He told such a dismal story\nalways, that I never liked to refuse him some assistance; but yesterday,\nwhen he was here, the thought struck me by chance to say, 'What a fine\nsupper you had last night, John!' You should have seen the start he\ngave, and his look of consternation, when he answered, 'Eh, Sir! how did\nye hear of that! We got the turkey very cheap, and none of us took more\nthan two glasses of toddy.'\"\n\n\"That boy is pointing to his pockets, and making more signs for us to\nopen the window!\" exclaimed Laura. \"What can it all mean! he seems so\nvery anxious!\"\n\nMajor Graham threw down his knife and fork--rose hastily from\nbreakfast--and flung open the window, calling out in rather a loud,\nangry voice, \"What do you want, you idle fellow? It is a perfect shame\nto see you standing there all morning! Surely you don't mean to say that\nan active youngster like you would disgrace yourself by begging?\"\n\n\"No, Sir! I want nothing!\" answered the boy respectfully, but colouring\nto the deepest scarlet. \"I never asked for money in my life, and I never\nwill.\"\n\n\"That's right, my good boy!\" answered the Major, instantly changing his\ntone. \"What brings you here then?\"\n\n\"Please, Sir, your servants shut the door in my face, and every body is\nso hasty like, that I don't know what to do. I can't be listened to for\na minute, though I have got something very particular to say, that some\none would be glad to hear.\"\n\nMajor Graham now looked exceedingly vexed with himself, for having\nspoken so roughly to the poor boy, who had a thoughtful, mild, but\ncare-worn countenance, which was extremely interesting, while his manner\nseemed better than his dress.\n\nFrank was despatched, as a most willing messenger, to bring the young\nstranger up stairs, while uncle David told Harry that he would take this\nas a lesson to himself ever afterwards, not to judge hastily from\nappearances, because it was impossible for any one to guess what might\nbe in the mind of another; and he began to hope this boy, who was so\ncivil and well-spoken, might yet turn out to be a proper, industrious\nlittle fellow.\n\n\"Well, my lad! Is there anything I can do for you?\" asked Major Graham,\nwhen Frank led him kindly into the room. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Evan Mackay, at your service. Please, Sir, did you lose a pocket-book\nlast Thursday, with your name on the back, and nine gold sovereigns\ninside?\"\n\n\"Yes! that I did, to my cost! Have you heard anything of it?\"\n\nThe boy silently drew a parcel from his pocket, and without looking up\nor speaking, he modestly placed it on the table, then colouring very\ndeeply, he turned away, and hurried towards the door. In another minute\nhe would have been off, but Frank sprung forward and took hold of his\narm, saying, in the kindest possible manner, \"Stop, Evan! Stop a moment!\nThat parcel seems to contain all my uncle's money. Where did you get it?\nWho sent it here?\"\n\n\"I brought it, Sir! The direction is on the pocket-book, so there could\nbe no mistake.\"\n\n\"Did you find it yourself then?\"\n\n\"Yes! it was lying in the street that night when I ran for a Doctor to\nsee my mother, who is dying. She told me now to come back directly, Sir,\nso I must be going.\"\n\n\"But let us give you something for being so honest,\" said Frank. \"You\nare a fine fellow, and you deserve to be well rewarded.\"\n\n\"I only did my duty, Sir. Mother always says we should do right for\nconscience' sake, and not for a reward.\"\n\n\"Yes! but you are justly entitled to this,\" said Major Graham, taking a\nsovereign out of the purse. \"I shall do more for you yet, but in the\nmeantime here is what you have honestly earned to-day.\"\n\n\"If I thought so, Sir,\"----said the poor boy, looking wistfully at the\nglittering coin. \"If I was quite sure there could be no harm----, but I\nmust speak first to mother about it, Sir! She has seen better days once,\nand she is sadly afraid of my ever taking charity. Mother mends my\nclothes, and teaches me herself, and works very hard in other ways, but\nshe is quite bed-ridden, and we have scarcely anything but the trifle I\nmake by working in the fields. It is very difficult to get a job at all\nsometimes, and if you could put me in the way of earning that money,\nSir, it would make mother very happy. She is a little particular, and\nwould not taste a morsel that I could get by asking for it.\"\n\n\"That is being very proud!\" said Harry.\n\n\"No, Sir! it is not from pride,\" replied Evan; \"but mother says a\nmerciful God has provided for her many years, and she will not begin to\ndistrust Him now. Her hands are always busy, and her heart is always\ncheerful. She rears many little plants by her bedside, which we sell,\nand she teaches a neighbour's children, besides sewing for any one who\nwill employ her, for mother's maxim always was, that there can be no\nsuch thing as an idle Christian.\"\n\n\"Very true!\" said Lady Harriet. \"Even the apostles were mending their\nnets and labouring hard, whenever they were not teaching. Either the\nbody or the mind should always be active.\"\n\n\"If you saw mother, that is exactly her way, for she does not eat the\nbread of idleness. Were a stranger to offer us a blanket or a dinner in\ncharity, she would rather go without any than take it. A very kind lady\nbrought her a gown one day, but mother would only have it if she were\nallowed to knit as many stockings as would pay for the stuff. I dare not\ntake a penny more for my work than is due, for she says, if once I begin\nreceiving alms, I might get accustomed to it.\"\n\n\"That is the good old Scotch feeling of former days,\" observed Major\nGraham. \"It was sometimes carried too far then, but there is not enough\nof it now. Your mother should have lived fifty years ago.\"\n\n\"You may say so, indeed, Sir! We never had a drop of broth from the\nsoup-kitchen all winter, and many a day we shivered without a fire,\nthough the society offered her sixpence a-week for coals, but she says\n'the given morsel is soon done;' and now, many of our neighbours who\nwasted what they got, feel worse off than we, who are accustomed to\nsuffer want, and to live upon our honest labour. Long ago, if mother\nwent out to tea with any of our neighbours, she always took her own tea\nalong with us.\"\n\n\"But that is being prouder than anybody else,\" observed Frank, smiling.\n\"If my grandmama goes out to a tea-party, she allows her friends to\nprovide the fare.\"\n\n\"Very likely, Sir! but that is different when people can give as good as\nthey get. Last week a kind neighbour sent us some nice loaf bread, but\nmother made me take it back, with her best thanks, and she preferred our\nown oat cake. She is more ready to give than to take, Sir, and divides\nher last bannock, sometimes, with anybody who is worse off than\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Frank, compassionately; \"how much you must often\nhave suffered!\"\n\n\"Suffered!\" said the boy, with sudden emotion. \"Yes! I have suffered! It\nmatters nothing to be clothed in rags,--to be cold and hungry now! There\nare worse trials than that! My father died last year, crushed to death\nin a moment by his own cart-wheels,--my brothers and sisters have all\ngone to the grave, scarcely able to afford the medicines that might have\ncured them,--and I am left alone with my poor dying mother. It is a\ncomfort that life is not very long, and we may trust all to God while it\nlasts.\"\n\n\"Could you take us to see Mrs. Mackay?\" said Major Graham, kindly.\n\"Laura, get your bonnet.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir! that young lady could not stay half a minute in the place\nwhere my poor mother lives now. It is not a pretty cottage such as we\nread of in tracts, but a dark cold room, up a high stair, in the\nnarrowest lane you ever saw, with nothing to sit on but an old chest.\"\n\n\"Never mind that, Evan,\" replied Major Graham. \"You and your mother have\na spirit of honour and honesty that might shame many who are lying on\nsofas of silk and damask. I respect her, and shall assist you if it be\npossible. Show us the way.\"\n\nMany dirty closes and narrow alleys were threaded by the whole party,\nbefore they reached a dark ruinous staircase, where Evan paused and\nlooked round, to see whether Major Graham still approached. He then\nslowly mounted one flight of ancient crumbling steps after another,\nlighted by patched and broken windows, till at last they arrived at a\nnarrow wooden flight, perfectly dark. After groping to the summit, they\nperceived a time-worn door, the latch of which was gently lifted by\nEvan, who stole noiselessly into the room, followed by uncle David and\nthe wondering children.\n\nThere, a large cold room, nearly empty, but exceedingly clean, presented\nitself to their notice. In one corner stood a massive old chest of\ncarved oak, surrounded with a perfect glow of geraniums and myrtles in\nfull blossom; beside which were arranged a large antique Bible, a jug of\ncold water, and a pile of coarsely-knitted worsted stockings. Beyond\nthese, on a bed of clean straw, lay a tall, emaciated old woman,\napparently in the last stage of life, with a face haggard by suffering;\nand yet her thin, withered hands were busily occupied with needle-work,\nwhile, in low, faltering tones, she chanted these words,\n\n  \"When from the dust of death I rise,\n  To claim my mansion in the skies,\n  This, this shall be my only plea,\n  Jesus has liv'd and died for me.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" said Evan, wishing to arouse her attention. \"Look, mother!\"\n\n\"Good day, Mrs. Mackay,\" added Major Graham, in a voice of great\nconsideration, while she languidly turned her head towards the door. \"I\nhave come to thank you for restoring my purse this morning.\"\n\n\"You are kindly welcome, Sir! What else could we do!\" replied she, in a\nfeeble, tremulous voice. \"The money was yours, and the sooner it went\nout of our hands the better.\"\n\n\"It was perfectly safe while it stayed there,\" added Major Graham, not\naffecting to speak in a homely accent, nor putting on any airs of\ncondescension at all, but sitting down on the old chest as if he had\nnever sat on any thing but a chest in his life before, and looking at\nthe clean bare floor with as much respect as if it had been a Turkey\ncarpet. \"Your little boy's pocket seems to be as safe as the Bank of\nScotland.\"\n\n\"That is very true, Sir! My boy is honest; and it is well to keep a good\nconscience, as that is all he has in this world to live for. Many have a\nheavy conscience to carry with a heavy purse; but these he need not\nenvy. If we are poor in this world, we are rich in faith; and I trust\nthe money was not even a temptation to Evan, because he has learned from\nthe best of all teachers, that it would 'profit him nothing to gain the\nwhole world, and lose his own soul.'\"\n\n\"True, Mrs. Mackay! most true! We have come here this morning to request\nthat you and he will do me the favour to accept of a small recompense.\"\n\n\"We are already rewarded, Sir! This has been an opportunity of\ntestifying to our own hearts that we desire to do right in the eye of\nGod. At the same time, it was Providence who kindly directed my son's\nsteps to the place where that money was lying; and if anything seems\njustly due to poor Evan, let him have it. My wants are few, and must\nsoon be ended. But oh! when I look at that boy, and think of the long\nyears he may be struggling with poverty and temptation, my heart melts\nwithin me, and my whole spirit is broken. Faith itself seems to fail,\nand I could be a beggar for him now! It is not money I would ask, Sir,\nbecause that might soon be spent; but get him some honest employment,\nand I will thank you on my very knees.\"\n\nEvan seemed startled at the sudden energy of his mother's manner, and\ntears sprung into his eyes while she spoke with a degree of agitation so\ndifferent from what he had ever heard before; but he struggled to\nconceal his feelings, and she continued with increasing emotion,\n\n\"Bodily suffering, and many a year of care and sorrow, are fast closing\ntheir work on me. The moments are passing away like a weaver's shuttle;\nand if I had less anxiety about Evan, how blessed a prospect it would\nappear; but that is the bitterness of death to me now. My poor, poor\nboy! I would rather hear he was in the way of earning his livelihood,\nthan that he got a hundred a-year. Tell me, Sir!--and oh! consider you\nare speaking to a dying creature--can you possibly give him any\ncreditable employment, where he might gain a crust of bread, and be\nindependent?\"\n\n\"I honour your very proper feeling on the subject, Mrs. Mackay, and\nshall help Evan to the best of my ability,\" replied Major Graham, in a\ntone of seriousness and sincerity. \"To judge by these fine geraniums, he\nmust be fond of cultivating plants; and we want an under-gardener in the\ncountry; therefore he shall have that situation without loss of time.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother! mother! speak no more of dying! You will surely get better\nnow!\" said Evan, looking up, while his thin pale face assumed a\nmomentary glow of pleasure. \"Try now to get better! I never could work\nas well, if you were not waiting to see me come home! We shall be so\nhappy now!\"\n\n\"Yes! I am happy!\" said Mrs. Mackay, solemnly looking towards heaven,\nwith an expression that could not be mistaken. \"The last cord is cut\nthat bound me to the earth; and may you, Sir, find hereafter the\nblessings that are promised to those who visit the fatherless and widows\nin their affliction.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN.\n\n  When hands are link'd that dread to part,\n  And heart is met by throbbing heart;\n  Oh! bitter, bitter is the smart\n  Of them that bid farewell.\n\n                                        Heber.\n\n\nNext Monday morning, at an early hour, Frank had again found his way\nwith great difficulty to the house of Widow Mackay, where he spent all\nhis pocket money on two fine scarlet geraniums. If they had been nettles\nor cabbages, he would have felt the same pleasure in buying them; and\nhis eyes sparkled with animation when he entered uncle David's room,\ncarrying them in his hand, and saying, \"I was so glad to have some\nmoney! I could spare it quite well. There is no greater pleasure in\nbeing rich than to help such poor people as Evan Mackay and his poor\nsick mother!\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank, I often wonder that any enjoyment of wealth can be\nconsidered equal to the exercise of kind feelings, for surely the most\ndelightful sensation in this world is, to deserve and receive the\ngrateful affection of those around us,\" replied Major Graham. \"What a\nwretched being Robinson Crusoe was on the desert island alone, though he\nfound chests of gold, and yet many people are as unblessed in the midst\nof society, who selfishly hoard fortunes for themselves, unmindful of\nthe many around who ought to be gratefully receiving their daily\nbenefits.\"\n\n\"I was laughing to read lately of the West India slaves, who collected\nmoney all their lives in an old stocking,\" said Frank, \"and who watched\nwith delight as it filled from year to year; but the bank is only a\ngreat stocking, where misers in this country lay up treasures for\nthemselves which they are never to enjoy, though too often they lay up\nno treasures for themselves in a better world.\"\n\n\"I frequently think, Frank, if all men were as liberal, kind, and\nforbearing to each other as the Holy Scriptures enjoin, and if we lived\nas soberly, temperately, and godly together, what a paradise this world\nwould become, for many of our worst sufferings are brought on by our own\nfolly, or the unkindness of others. And certainly, if we wished to fancy\nthe wretchedness of hell itself, it would only be necessary to imagine\nwhat the earth would become if all fear of God and man were removed, and\nevery person lived as his own angry, selfish passions would dictate.\nGreat are the blessings we owe to Christianity, for making the world\neven what it is now, and yet greater would those blessings be, if we\nobeyed it better.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what grandmama says, and that we must attend to the\nGospel from love and gratitude to God, rather than from fear of\npunishment or hope of reward, which is precisely what we saw in poor\nwidow Mackay and Evan, who seemed scarcely to expect a recompense for\nbehaving so honestly.\"\n\n\"That was the more remarkable in them, as few Christians now are above\nreceiving a public recompense for doing their duty to God. Men of the\nworld have long rewarded each other with public dinners and pieces of\nplate, to express the utmost praise and admiration, but of late I never\nopen a newspaper without reading accounts of one clergyman or another,\nwho has been 'honoured with a public breakfast!' when he is presented\nby an admiring circle with 'a gold watch and appendages!' or a Bible\nwith a complimentary inscription, or a gown, or a pair of bands, worked\nby the ladies of his congregation! and all this, for labouring among his\nown people, in his own sphere of duty! What would Archbishop Leighton\nand the old divines have said to any one who attempted to rouse their\nvanity in this way, with the praise of men?\"\n\n\"What you say reminds me, uncle David,\" said Frank, \"that we have been\nasked to present our Universal-Knowledge-Master with a silver snuff-box,\nas a testimonial from the scholars in my class, because he is going soon\nto Van Dieman's Land, therefore I hope you will give me half-a-crown to\nsubscribe, or I shall be quite in disgrace with him.\"\n\n\"Not one shilling shall you receive from me, my good friend, for any\nsuch purpose! a snuff-box, indeed! your master ought to show his\nscholars an example of using none! a filthy waste of health, money, and\ntime. Such testimonials should only be given, as Archbishop Magee says,\nto persons who have got into some scrape, which makes their\nrespectability doubtful. If my grocer is ever publicly presented with a\npair of silver sugar tongs, I shall think he has been accused of\nadulterating the sugar, and give over employing him directly.\"\n\n\"Laura,\" said Frank, \"you will be having a silver thimble voted to you\nfor hemming six pocket-handkerchiefs in six years!\"\n\n\"I know one clergyman, Dr. Seton, who conscientiously refused a piece of\nplate, which was about to be presented in this way,\" continued Major\nGraham; \"he accidentally heard that such a subscription was begun among\nthe rich members of his congregation, and instantly stopped it, saying,\n'Let your testimonial consist in a regular attendance at church, and let\nmy sole reward be enjoyed hereafter, when you appear as my crown of joy\nand rejoicing in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming.'\"\n\nSir Edward Graham's particular friend, Captain Gordon, at last wrote to\nsay, that the Thunderbolt, 74, having been put in commission for three\nyears, was about to sail for the African station, therefore he wished\nFrank to join without delay; and as a farther mark of his regard, he\npromised that he would endeavour to keep his young protege employed\nuntil he had served out his time, because a midshipman once paid off,\nwas like a stranded whale, not very easily set afloat again.\n\nLady Harriet sighed when she read the letter, and looked paler all that\nday, but she knew that it was right and necessary for Frank to go,\ntherefore she said nothing to distress him on the occasion, only in her\nprayers and explanations of the Bible that evening, there was a deeper\ntone of feeling than ever, and a cast of melancholy, which had rarely\nbeen the case before, while he spoke much of that meeting in a better\nworld, which is the surest hope and consolation of those Christians who\nseparate on earth, and who know not what a day, and still less what many\nyears, may bring forth.\n\nMajor Graham tried to put a cheerful face on the matter also, though he\nevidently felt very sorry indeed about parting with Frank, and took him\nout a long walk to discuss his future prospects, saying, \"Now you are an\nofficer and a gentleman, entitled therefore to be treated with new\nrespect and attention, by all your brother officers, naval or military,\nin his Majesty's service.\"\n\nFrank himself, being a boy of great spirit and enterprize, felt glad\nthat the time had really come for his being afloat, and examining all\nthe world over with his own eyes; but he said that his heart seemed as\nif it had been put in a swing, it fell so low when he thought of leaving\nhis dear happy home, and then it rose again higher than ever at the very\nidea of being launched on the wide ocean, and going to the countries he\nhad so often read of, where battles had been fought and victories won.\n\n\"Frank!\" said Peter Grey, who was going to join the Thunderbolt, in\nabout a fortnight afterwards, \"you have no idea how beautiful I looked\nin uniform to-day! I tried mine on, and felt so impatient to use my\ndirk, I could have eat my dinner with it, instead of employing a common\nknife.\"\n\n\"You never forget to be hungry, Peter,\" said Frank, laughing. \"But now\nyou are like the old Lord Buchan, who used to say he could cook his\nporridge in his helmet, and stir it with his broad-sword.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Major Graham, \"you both intend to become very\ndistinguished officers, and to leave a name at which the world grows\npale.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Peter. \"All the old heroes we read of shall be\nmere nobodies compared to me! I mean to lose a leg or an arm in every\nbattle,\"----\n\n\"Till nothing is left of you but your shirt-collar and shoe-strings,\"\ninterrupted Frank, laughing.\n\n\"No! No! What remains of me at last shall die a Peer of the realm,\"\ncontinued Peter. \"We must climb to the top of the tree, Frank! What\ntitle do you think I should take?\"\n\n\"Lord Cockpit would suit you best for some time, Peter! It will not be\nso easy a business to rise as you think. Every one can run a race, but\nvery few can win,\" observed Major Graham. \"The rarest thing on earth is\nto succeed in being both conspicuous and respectable. Any dunce may\neasily be either the one or the other, but the chief puzzle with most\nmen is, how to be both. In your profession there are great\nopportunities, but at the same time let me warn you, that the sea is not\na bed of roses.\"\n\n\"No, uncle David! but I hope it will become a field of laurels to us,\"\nreplied Frank, laughing. \"Now tell me in real earnest who you think was\nthe greatest of our naval heroes till now, when Peter is to cut them all\nout.\"\n\n\"He must wait a few years. It is a long ladder to run up before reaching\nthe top. In France, the king's sons are all born Field Marshals, but\nnobody in this country is born an Admiral. The great Lord Duncan served\nduring half-a-century before gaining his most important victory, but\nprevious to that, he paved the way to success, not by mere animal\ncourage alone, but by being so truly good and religious a man, that his\nextraordinary firmness and benevolence of character gained the\nconfidence and respect of all those who served with him, and therefore\nhalf his success in battle was owing to his admirable conduct during\npeace.\"\n\n\"So I have heard!\" replied Frank; \"and when there was mutiny in every\nother ship, the Admiral's own crew remained faithful to him. How much\nbetter it is to be obeyed from respect and attachment than from fear,\nwhich is a mean feeling that I hope neither to feel myself, nor to\nexcite in others. I wish to be like Nelson, who asked, 'What is fear? I\nnever saw it.'\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank! Nelson was said to be 'brave as a lion, and gentle as a\nlamb.' Certainly both he and Lord Duncan were pre-eminently great; but\nneither Lord Duncan, nor any other enlightened Christian, would have\nsaid what Lord Nelson did, with his latent breath--'I have not been a\ngreat sinner!' No mortal could lift up his eyes at the day of judgment,\nand repeat those words again; for every man that breathes the breath of\nlife is a great sinner. We are living in God's own world without\nremembering him, continually; and amidst thousands of blessings we\ndisobey him. The chief purpose for which men are created, is to glorify\nGod, and to prepare for entering his presence in a better world; but\ninstead of doing so, we live as if there were no other object to live\nfor, than our own pleasures and amusements on earth. How, then, can we\nbe otherwise than great sinners? I hope, Frank, that you will endeavour\nto be, like Lord Duncan, not merely a good officer, but also a good\nChristian; for, besides fighting the battles of your country, you must\ngain a great victory over yourself, as all men must either conquer their\nown evil dispositions, or perish for ever.\"\n\nLady Harriet was particularly earnest in entreating Frank to write\nfrequently home; observing, that she considered it a religious duty in\nall children, to shew their parents this attention, as the Bible says\nthat \"a wise son maketh a glad father,\" and that \"the father of the\nrighteous shall greatly rejoice;\" but on the contrary, too many young\npersons leave their parents to mourn in suspense and anxiety, as to the\nhealth and happiness of those whom they love more than they can ever\nlove any one else.\n\n\"Tell us of every thing that interests you, and even all about the\nspouting whales, flying fish, and dying dolphins, which you will of\ncourse see,\" said Laura. \"Be sure to write us also, how many albatrosses\nyou shoot, and whether you are duly introduced to Neptune at the Cape.\"\n\n\"Yes, Laura! but Bishop Heber's Journal, or any other book describing a\nvoyage to the Cape, mentions exactly the same thing. It will quite bring\nme home again when I speak to you all on paper; and I shall be able to\nfancy what everybody will say when my letter is read. Mrs. Darwin sent\nfor me this morning on particular business; and it was to say that she\nwished me, in all the strange countries where the Thunderbolt touched,\nto employ my spare moments in chasing butterflies, that as many as\npossible might be added to her museum.\"\n\n\"Capital! How like Mrs. Darwin!\" exclaimed Major Graham, laughing. \"You\nwill of course be running all over Africa, hat in hand, pursuing painted\nbutterflies, till you get a _coup de soleil_, like my friend Watson, who\nwas killed by one. Poor fellow! I was with him then, and it was a\nfrightful scene. He wheeled round several times, in a sort of\nconvulsion, till he dropped down dead in my arms.\"\n\n\"I shall gild the legs and bills of some ducks before leaving home, and\nsend them to her as a present from Sierra Leone,\" said Peter. \"The wings\nmight be died scarlet, which would look quite foreign; and if an\nelephant falls in my way, it shall be stuffed and forwarded by express.\"\n\n\"Uncle David! Do you remember what fun we had, when you sent Mrs. Darwin\nthat stuffed bear in a present! I was desired to announce that a\nforeigner of distinction had arrived to stay at her house. What a bustle\nshe was in on hearing that he brought letters of introduction from you,\nand intended to remain some time. Then we told her that he could not\nspeak a word of English, and brought 'a Pole' with him; besides which he\nhad once been a great dancer. Oh! how amusing it was, when she at last\nventured into the passage to be introduced, and saw her fine stuffed\nbear.\"\n\n\"Whatever people collect,\" said Peter, \"every good-natured person\nassists. I mean to begin a collection of crooked sixpences immediately;\ntherefore, pray never spend another, but give me as many as you can\nspare; and the more crooked the better.\"\n\n\"Sing a song a sixpence!\" said Frank, laughing. \"Laura should begin to\ncollect diamonds for a necklace, and perhaps it might be all ready\nbefore she comes out. I shall return home on purpose to see you then,\nLaura.\"\n\n\"Pray do, Master Frank,\" said Mrs. Crabtree, with more than usual\nkindness; \"we shall have great rejoicings on the occasion of seeing you\nback--an ox roasted alive, as they do in England, and all them sort of\nTom-fooleries. I'll dance a jig then myself for joy--you certainly are a\nwonderful good boy, considering that I had not the managing of you.\"\n\nFrank's departure was delayed till after the examination of his school,\nbecause Mr. Lexicon had requested that, being the best scholar there, he\nmight remain to receive a whole library of prize-books, and a whole\npocketful of medals; for, as Peter remarked, \"Frank Graham deserved any\nreward, because he learned his lessons so perfectly, that he could not\nsay them wrong even if he wished!\"\n\nHarry and Laura were allowed to attend on the great occasion, that they\nmight witness Frank's success; and never, certainly, had they seen any\nthing so grand in their lives before! A hundred and forty boys, all\ndressed in white trowsers and yellow gloves, were seated in rows,\nopposite to six grave learned-looking gentlemen, in wigs and spectacles,\nwho seemed as if they would condemn all the scholars to death!\n\nThe colour mounted into Harry's cheeks with delight, and the tears\nrushed into his eyes, when he saw Frank, whose face was radiant with\ngood-humour and happiness, take his place as head boy in the school. All\nhis companions had crowded round Frank as he entered, knowing that this\nwas his last appearance in the class; while he spoke a merry or a kind\nword to each, leaning on the shoulder of one, and grasping the hand of\nanother with cordial kindness, for he liked everybody, and everybody\nliked him. No one envied Frank being dux, because they knew how hard he\nworked for that place, and how anxious he had been to help every other\nboy in learning as cleverly as himself; for all the boobies would have\nbecome duxes if Frank could have assisted them to rise, while many an\nidler had been made busy by his attention and advice. No boy ever\nreceived, in one day, more presents than Frank did on this occasion from\nhis young friends, who spent all their pocket-money in pen-knives and\npencil-cases, which were to be kept by Frank, in remembrance of them, as\nlong as he lived; and some of his companions had a tear in their eye on\nbidding him farewell, which pleased him more than all their gifts.\n\nMajor Graham took his place, with more gravity than usual, among the\njudges appointed to distribute the prizes; and now, during more than\ntwo hours, the most puzzling questions that could be invented were put\nto every scholar in succession, while Frank seemed always ready with an\nanswer, and not only spoke for himself, but often good-naturedly\nprompted his neighbours, in so low a tone that no one else heard him.\nHis eyes brightened, and his face grew red with anxiety, while even his\nvoice shook at first; but before long Frank collected all his wits about\nhim, and could construe Latin or repeat Greek with perfect ease, till at\nlength the whole examination concluded, and the great Dr. Clifford, who\nhad lately come all the way from Oxford, was requested to present the\nprizes. Upon this he rose majestically from his arm-chair, and made a\nlong speech, filled as full as it could hold with Latin and Greek. He\npraised Homer and Horace for nearly twenty minutes, and brought in\nseveral lines from Virgil, after which he turned to Frank, saying, in a\ntone of great kindness and condescension, though at the same time\nexceedingly pompous,\n\n\"It seems almost a pity that this young gentleman--already so very\naccomplished a scholar--who is, I may say, a perfect _multum in parvo_,\nshould prematurely pause in his classical career to enter the navy; but\nin every situation of life his extraordinary activity of mind, good\ntemper, courage and ability, must render him an honour to his country\nand his profession.\"\n\nDr. Clifford now glanced over the list of prizes, and read aloud--\"First\nprize for Greek--Master Graham!\"\n\nFrank walked gracefully forward, coloured and bowed, while a few words\nof approbation were said to him, and a splendidly-bound copy of\nEuripides was put into his hands by Dr. Clifford, who then hastily read\nover the catalogue of prizes to himself, in an audible voice, and in a\ntone of great surprise.\n\n\"First prize for Latin!--Master Graham! First for algebra,--first for\ngeography,--first for mathematics,--all Master Graham!!!--and last, not\nleast, a medal for general good conduct, which the boys are allowed to\nbestow upon the scholar they think most deserving,--and here stands the\nname of Master Graham again!!\"\n\nDr. Clifford paused, while the boys all stood up for a moment and\nclapped their hands with enthusiasm, as a token of rejoicing at the\ndestination of their own medal.\n\nFor the first time Frank was now completely overcome,--he coloured more\ndeeply than before, and looked gratefully round, first at his\ncompanions, then at his master, and last at Major Graham, who had a tear\nstanding in his eye when he smiled upon Frank, and held out his hand.\n\nFrank's lip quivered for a moment, as if he would burst into tears, but\nwith a strong effort he recovered himself, and affectionately grasping\nhis uncle's hand, hastily resumed his place on the bench, to remain\nthere while his companions received the smaller prizes awarded to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry had been watching Frank with a feeling of joy and\npride, such as he never experienced before, and could scarcely refrain\nfrom saying to every person near him, \"That is my brother!\" He looked at\nFrank long and earnestly, wishing to be like him, and resolving to\nfollow his good example at school. He gazed again and again, with new\nfeelings of pleasure and admiration, till gradually his thoughts became\nmelancholy, while remembering how soon they must be separated; and\nsuddenly the terrible idea darted into his mind, \"Perhaps we never may\nmeet again!\" Harry tried not to think of this; he turned his thoughts to\nother subjects; he forced himself to look at anything that was going on,\nbut still these words returned with mournful apprehension to his heart,\n\"Perhaps we never may meet again!\"\n\nFrank's first action, after the examination had been concluded, was\nhastily to gather up all his books, and bring a sight of them to Harry\nand Laura; but what was his astonishment when, instead of looking at\nthe prizes, Harry suddenly threw his arms round his neck, and burst into\ntears.\n\n\"My dear--dear boy! what has happened!\" exclaimed Frank, affectionately\nembracing him, and looking much surprised. \"Tell me, dear Harry, has any\nthing distressed you?\"\n\n\"I don't know very well, Frank! but you are going away,--and--and--I\nwish I had been a better boy! I would do any thing you bid me now!--but\nI shall never be so happy again--no! never, without you!\"\n\n\"But, dear Harry! you will have Laura and grandmama, and uncle David,\nall left, and I am coming back some day! Oh! what a happy meeting we\nshall have then!\" said Frank, while the tears stood in his eyes; and\ndrawing Harry's arm within his own, they walked slowly away together.\n\n\"I am very--very anxious for you and Laura to be happy,\" continued\nFrank, in the kindest manner; \"but, dear Harry, will you not take more\ncare to do as you are bid, and not always to prefer doing what you like!\nMrs. Crabtree would not be half so terrible if you did not provoke her\nby some new tricks every day. I almost like her myself; for as the old\nproverb says, 'her bark is worse than her bite;' and she often reminds\nme of that funny old fable, where the mice were more afraid of the loud,\nfierce-looking cock, than of the sleek, smooth-looking cat, for there\nare people carrying gentler tongues yet quite as difficult to deal with.\nAt the same time, seeing how uncomfortable you and Laura both feel with\nMrs. Crabtree, I have written a letter to papa, asking, as my last and\nonly request on leaving home, that he will make a change of ministry,\nand he is always so very kind, that I feel sure he will grant it.\"\n\n\"How good of you, Frank!\" said Harry. \"I am sure it is our own faults\nvery often when we are in disgrace, for we are seldom punished till we\ndeserve it; but I am so sorry you are going away, that I can think of\nnothing else.\"\n\n\"So am I, very sorry indeed; but my best comfort, when far from home,\nwould be, to think that you and Laura are happy, which will be the case\nwhen you become more watchful to please grandmama.\"\n\n\"That is very true, Frank! and I would rather offend twenty Mrs.\nCrabtrees than one grandmama; but perhaps uncle David may send me to\nschool now, when I shall try to be like you, sitting at the top of the\nclass, and getting prizes for good behaviour.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry! my pleasantest days at school have been those when I was\nbusiest, and you will find the same thing. How delightful it was, going\nover and over my tasks till they were quite perfect, and then rushing\nout to the play-ground, where my mind got a rest, while my body was\nactive; you know it is seldom that both mind and body work at once, and\nthe best way of resting the one is, to make the other labour. That is\nprobably the reason, Harry, why games are never half so pleasant as\nafter hard study.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Harry, doubtfully; \"but I always hate any thing that\nI am obliged to do.\"\n\n\"Then never be a sailor, as I shall be obliged to do fifty things a-day\nthat I would rather not; for instance, to get up in the middle of the\nnight, when very likely dreaming about being at home again; but, as\ngrandmama says, it is pleasant to have some duties, for life would not\nget on well without them.\"\n\n\"Yes--perhaps--I don't know!--we could find plenty to do ourselves,\nwithout anybody telling us. I should like to-morrow, to watch the boys\nplaying at cricket, and to see the races, and the Diorama, and in the\nevening to shoot our bows and arrows.\"\n\n\"My good Sir! what the better would you, or anybody else, be of such a\nlife as that! Not a thing in this world is made to be useless, Harry;\nthe very weeds that grow in the ground are for some serviceable purpose,\nand you would not wish to be the only creature on earth living entirely\nfor yourself. It would be better if neither of us had ever been born,\nthan that the time and opportunities which God gives us for improving\nourselves and doing good to others, should all be wasted. Let me hope,\nHarry, when I am away, that you will often consider how dull grandmama\nmay then feel, and how happy you might make her by being very attentive\nand obedient.\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank! but I could never fill your place!--that is quite\nimpossible! Nobody can do that!\"\n\n\"Try!--only try, Harry! grandmama is very easily pleased when people do\ntheir best. She would not have felt so well satisfied with me, if that\nhad not been the case.\"\n\n\"Frank!\" said Harry, sorrowfully, \"I feel as if ten brothers were going\naway instead of one, for you are so good to me! I shall be sure to\nmention you in my prayers, because that is all I can do for you now.\"\n\n\"Not all, Harry! though that is a great deal; you must write to me\noften, and tell me what makes you happy or unhappy, for I shall be more\ninterested than ever, now that we are separated. Tell me everything\nabout my school-fellows, too, and about Laura. There is no corner of the\nwide world where I shall not think of you both every day, and feel\nanxious about the very least thing that concerns you.\"\n\n\"My dear boys!\" said Major Graham, who had joined them some moments\nbefore, \"it is fortunate that you have both lived always in the same\nhome, for that will make you love each other affectionately as long as\nyou live. In England, children of one family are all scattered to\ndifferent schools, without any one to care whether they are attached or\nnot, therefore their earliest and warmest friendships are formed with\nstrangers of the same age, whom they perhaps never see again, after\nleaving school. In that case, brothers have no happy days of childhood\nto talk over in future life, as you both have,--no little scrapes to\nremember, that they got into together--no pleasures enjoyed at the same\nmoment to smile at the recollection of, and no friction of their tempers\nin youth, such as makes every thing go on smoothly between brothers when\nthey grow older; therefore, when at last grown up and thrown together,\nthey scarcely feel more mutual friendship and intimacy than any other\ngentlemen testify towards each other.\"\n\n\"I dare say that is very true,\" said Frank. \"Tom Brownlow tells me when\nhis three brothers come home from Eton, Harrow, and Durham, they quarrel\nso excessively, that sometimes no two of them are on speaking terms.\"\n\n\"Not at all improbable,\" observed Major Graham. \"In every thing we see\nhow much better God's arrangements are than our own. Families were\nintended to be like a little world in themselves--old people to govern\nthe young ones--young people to make their elders cheerful--grown-up\nbrothers and sisters to show their juniors a good example--and children\nto be playthings and companions to their seniors, but that is all at an\nend in the present system.\"\n\n\"Old Andrew says that large families 'squander' themselves all over the\nearth now,\" said Frank, laughing.\n\n\"Yes! very young children are thrust into preparatory schools--older\nboys go to distant academies--youths to College--and young men are\nshipped off abroad, while who among them all can say his heart is in his\nown home? Parents in the meantime, finding no occupation or amusement in\neducating their children, begin writing books, perhaps theories of\neducation, or novels; and try to fill up the rest of their useless hours\nwith plays, operas, concerts, balls, or clubs. If people could only know\nwhat is the best happiness of this life, it certainly depends on being\nloved by those we belong to; for nothing can be called peace on earth,\nwhich does not consist in family affection, built upon a strong\nfoundation of religion and morality.\"\n\nSir Edward Graham felt very proud of Frank, as all gentlemen are of\ntheir eldest sons, and wrote a most affectionate letter on the occasion\nof his going to sea, promising to meet him at Portsmouth, and lamenting\nthat he still felt so ill and melancholy he could not return home, but\nmeant to try whether the baths in Germany would do him any good. In this\nletter was enclosed what he called \"Frank's first prize-money,\" the\nlargest sum the young midshipman had ever seen in his life, and before\nit had been a day in his possession, more than the half was spent on\npresents to his friends. Not a single person seemed to be forgotten\nexcept himself; for Frank was so completely unselfish, that Peter Grey\nonce laughingly said, \"Frank scarcely remembers there is such a person\nas himself in the world, therefore it is astonishing how he contrives to\nexist at all.\"\n\n\"If that be his worst fault, you shew him a very opposite example,\nPeter,\" said Major Graham, smiling; \"number one is a great favourite\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Frank is also very obliging!\" added Lady Harriet; \"he would do anything\nfor any body.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor fellow! he can't help that,\" said Peter, in a tone of pity.\n\"Some people are born with that sort of desperate activity--flying to\nassist every one--running up stairs for whatever is wanted--searching\nfor whatever is lost--and picking up whatever has been dropped. I have\nseen several others like Frank, who were troubled with that sort of\nturn. He is indulging his own inclination in flying about everywhere for\neverybody, as much as I do in sitting still!--it is all nature!--you\nknow tastes differ, for some people like apples and some like onions.\"\n\nFrank had a black shade of himself, drawn in uniform and put into a\ngilt frame, all for one shilling, which he presented to his grandmama,\nwho looked sadly at the likeness when he came smiling into her\ndressing-room, and calling Harry to assist in knocking a nail into the\nwall, that it might be hung above the chimney-piece. \"I need nothing to\nremind me of you, dear Frank,\" observed Lady Harriet, \"and this is a sad\nexchange, the shadow for the substance.\" Frank gave a handsome new red\nmorocco spectacle-case to uncle David, and asked leave to carry away the\nold one with him as a remembrance. He bought gowns for all the maids,\nand books for all the men-servants. He presented Mrs. Crabtree with an\nelegant set of tea-cups and saucers, promising to send her a box of tea\nthe first time he went to China; and for Laura and Harry he produced a\nmagnificent magic lanthorn, representing all the stars and planets,\nwhich cost him several guineas. It was exhibited the evening before\nFrank went away, and caused great entertainment to a large party of his\ncompanions, who assembled at tea to take leave of him, on which occasion\nPeter Grey made a funny speech, proposing Frank's health in a bumper of\nbohea, when the whole party became very merry, and did not disperse till\nten.\n\nMajor Graham intended accompanying Frank to Portsmouth, and they were to\nset off by the mail next evening. That day was a sad one to Harry and\nLaura, who were allowed a whole holiday; but not a sound of merriment\nwas heard in the house, except when Frank tried to make them cheerful,\nby planning what was to be done after he came back, or when Major Graham\ninvented droll stories about the adventures Frank would probably meet\nwith at sea. Even Mrs. Crabtree looked more grave and cross than usual;\nand she brought Frank a present of a needle-case made with her own\nhands, and filled with thread of every kind, saying, that she heard all\n\"midshipmites\" learned to mend their things, and keep them decent, which\nwas an excellent custom, and ought to be encouraged; but she hoped he\nwould remember, that \"a stitch in time saves nine.\"\n\nLady Harriet stayed most of that day in her dressing-room, and tried to\nconceal the traces of many tears when she did appear; but it was only\ntoo evident how sadly her time had been passed alone.\n\n\"Grandmama!\" said Frank, taking her hand affectionately, and trying to\nlook cheerful; \"we shall meet again; perhaps very soon!\"\n\nLady Harriet silently laid her hand upon the Bible, to show that there\nshe found the certain assurance of another meeting in a better world;\nbut she looked at Frank with melancholy affection, and added, very\nsolemnly and emphatically,\n\n  \"'There is no union here of hearts,\n  That finds not here an end.'\"\n\n\"But, grandmama! you are not so very old!\" exclaimed Laura, earnestly.\n\"Lord Rockville was born ten years sooner, and besides, young people\nsometimes die before older people.\"\n\n\"Yes, Laura! young people may die, but old people must. It is not\npossible that this feeble aged frame of mine can long remain in the\nvisible world. 'The eye of him that hath seen me shall me no more.' I\nhave many more friends under the earth now, than on it. The streets of\nthis city would be crowded, if all those I once knew and still remember,\ncould be revived; but my turn is fast coming, like theirs, and Frank\nknows, as all of you do, where it is my hope and prayer that we may\ncertainly meet again.\"\n\n\"Grandmama!\" said Frank, in a low and broken voice, \"it wants but an\nhour to the time of my departure; I should like much if the servants\nwere to come up now for family prayers and if uncle David would read us\nthe 14th chapter of St. John.\"\n\nLady Harriet rung the bell, and before long the whole household had\nassembled, as not one would have been absent on the night of Master\nFrank's departure from home, which all were deeply grieved at, and even\nMrs. Crabtree dashed a tear from her cheek as she entered the room.\n\nFrank sat with his hand in Lady Harriet's, while Major Graham read the\nbeautiful and comforting chapter which had been selected, and when the\nwhole family kneeled in solemn prayer together, many a deep sob, which\ncould not be conquered, was heard from Frank himself. After all was\nover, he approached the servants, and silently shook hands with each,\nbut could not attempt to speak; after which Lady Harriet led him to her\ndressing-room, where they remained some time, till, the carriage having\narrived, Frank hastened into the drawing-room, clasped Harry and Laura\nin his arms, and having, in a voice choked with grief, bid them both a\nlong farewell, he hurried out of their presence.\n\nWhen the door closed, something seemed to fall heavily on the ground,\nbut this scarcely attracted any one's attention, till Major Graham\nfollowed Frank, and was shocked to find him lying on the staircase\nperfectly insensible. Instead of calling for assistance, however, uncle\nDavid carefully lifted Frank in his own arms, and carried him to the\ncarriage, where, after a few moments, the fresh air, and the rapid\nmotion revived his recollection, and he burst into tears.\n\n\"Poor grandmama! and Harry and Laura!\" cried he, weeping convulsively.\n\"Oh! when shall I see them all again!\"\n\n\"My dear boy!\" said Major Graham, trying to be cheerful; \"do you think\nnobody ever left home before? One would suppose you never expected to\ncome back! Three years seem an age when we look forward, but are nothing\nafter they have fled. The longer we live, the shorter every year\nappears, and it will seem only the day after to-morrow when you are\nrushing into the house again, and all of us standing at the door to\nwelcome you back. Think what a joyous moment that will be! There is a\nwide and wonderful world for you to see first, and then a happy home\nafterwards to revisit.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, good, kind uncle David! no one ever had a happier home; and\ntill the east comes to the west, I shall never cease to think of it with\ngratitude to you and grandmama. We shall surely all meet again. I must\nlive upon that prospect. Hope is the jewel that remains wherever we go,\nand the hope to which grandmama has directed me, is truly compared to a\nrainbow, which not only brightens the earth, but stretches to heaven.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE AMUSING DRIVE.\n\n  I would not enter on my list of friends\n  (Though grac'd with polish'd manners and fine sense,\n  Yet wanting sensibility) the man\n  Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.\n\n                                        Cowper.\n\n\nLady Harriet was confined to bed for several days after Frank's\ndeparture from home, and during all that week Harry and Laura felt so\nmelancholy, that even Mrs. Crabtree became sorry for them, saying it was\nquite distressing to see how quiet and good they had become, for Master\nHarry was as mild as milk now, and she almost wished he would be at some\nof his old tricks again.\n\nOn the following Monday, a message arrived from Lady Rockville, to say\nthat she was going a long drive in her phaeton, to visit some boys at\nMusselburgh school, and would be happy to take Harry and Laura of the\nparty, if their grandmama had no objection. None being made by anybody,\nthey flew up stairs to get ready, while Harry did not take above three\nsteps at a time, and Laura, when she followed, felt quite astonished to\nfind Mrs. Crabtree looking almost as pleased as herself, and saying she\nhoped the expedition would do them both good.\n\nBefore five minutes had elapsed, Harry was mounted on the dickey, where\nLady Rockville desired him to sit, instead of the footman, who was now\ndismissed, as no room could be made for both; so after that Harry\ntouched his hat whenever any of the party spoke to him, as if he had\nreally been the servant.\n\nLaura, meanwhile, was placed between Lady Rockville and Miss Perceval,\nwhere she could hardly keep quiet a minute for joy, though afraid to\nturn her head or to stir her little finger, in case of being thought\ntroublesome.\n\n\"I am told that the races take place at Musselburgh to-day,\" said Lady\nRockville. \"It is a cruel amusement, derived from the sufferings of\nnoble animals; they have as good a right to be happy in the world as\nourselves, Laura; but we shall pass that way, so Harry and you will\nprobably see the crowds of carriages.\"\n\n\"Oh, how enchanting!--I never saw a race-course in my life!\" exclaimed\nLaura, springing off her seat with delight. \"Harry! Harry! we are going\nto the races!\"\n\n\"Hurra!\" exclaimed Harry, clapping his hands; \"what a delightful\nsurprise! Oh! I am so dreadfully happy!\"\n\n\"After all, my dear Lady Rockville,\" said Miss Perceval, yawning, \"what\nhave horses got legs for, except to run?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not at such a pace! It always shocked me--formerly at\nDoncaster, where the jockeys were sometimes paid £1000 for winning--to\nsee how the poor animals were lashed and spurred along the course,\nfoaming with fatigue, gasping till they nearly expired. Horses, poor\ncreatures, from the hour of their birth till their death, have a sad\ntime of it!\"\n\n\"Grandmama once read me a beautiful description of a wild horse in his\nnatural state of liberty,\" said Laura. \"Among the South American forests\nhe was to be seen carrying his head erect, with sparkling eyes, flowing\nmane, and splendid tail, trotting about among the noble trees, or\ncropping the grass at his feet, looking quite princely, and doing\nprecisely what he pleased.\"\n\n\"Then look at the contrast,\" said Lady Rockville, pointing to a long row\nof cart-horses with galled sides, shrivelled skins, broken knees, and\nemaciated bodies, which were all dragging their weary load along.\n\"Animals are all meant for the use of man, but not to be abused, like\nthese poor creatures!\"\n\n\"As for racing,\" said Miss Perceval, \"a thorough-bred horse enters into\nthe spirit of it quite as much as his rider. Did you never hear of\nQuin's celebrated steed, which became so eager to win, that when his\nantagonist passed he seized him violently by the leg, and both jockeys\nhad to dismount that the furious animal might be torn away. The famous\nhorse Forester, too, caught hold of his opponent by the jaw, and could\nscarcely be disengaged.\"\n\n\"Think of all the cruel training these poor creatures went through\nbefore they came to that,\" added Lady Rockville; \"of the way in which\nhorses are beaten, spurred, and severely cut with the whip; then, after\ntheir strength fails, like the well-known 'high-mettled racer,' the poor\nanimal is probably sold at last to perpetual hard labour and ill-usage.\"\n\n\"Uncle David shewed me yesterday,\" said Laura, \"that horrid picture\nwhich you have probably seen, by Cruickshanks, of the Knackers' Yards in\nLondon, where old horses are sent to end their miserable days, after it\nis impossible to torture them any longer into working. Oh! it was\ndreadful! and yet grandmama said the whole sketch had been taken from\nlife.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" answered Lady Rockville. \"In these places the wretched\nanimals are literally put to death by starvation, and may be seen\ngnawing each other's manes in the last agonies of hunger.\"\n\n\"My dear Lady Rockville,\" exclaimed Miss Perceval, affectedly, \"how can\nyou talk of such unpleasant things!--there is an Act of Parliament\nagainst cruelty to animals, so of course no such thing exists now. Many\ngentlemen are vastly kind to old horses, turning them out to grass for\nyears, that they may enjoy a life of elegant leisure and rural\nretirement, to which, no doubt, some are well entitled; for instance,\nthe famous horse Eclipse, which gained his owner £25,000! I wish he had\nbeen mine!\"\n\n\"But think how many are ruined when one is enriched, and indeed both are\nruined in morals and good feeling; therefore I am glad that our sex have\nnever yet taken to the turf. It is bad enough, my dear Miss Perceval, to\nsee that they have taken to the moors; for were I to say all I think of\nthose amazons who lately killed their six brace of grouse on the 12th of\nAugust, they would probably challenge me to single combat. Lord\nRockville says, 'What with gentlemen doing worsted work, and ladies\nshouldering double-barrelled guns, he scarcely thinks this can be the\nsame world he was born in long ago.'\"\n\nThe carriage, at this moment, began to proceed along the road with such\nextraordinary rapidity, that there seemed no danger of their following\nin the dust of any other equipage, and Miss Perceval became exceedingly\nalarmed, especially when Lady Rockville mentioned that this was one of\nthe first times she had been driven by her new coachman, who seemed so\nvery unsteady on his seat, she had felt apprehensive, for some time,\nthat he might be drunk.\n\n\"A tipsy coachman! Dear Lady Rockville, do let me out! We shall\ncertainly be killed in this crowd of carriages! I can walk home! Pray\nstop him, Miss Laura! I came to look on at a race, but not to run one\nmyself! This fast driving is like a railroad, only not quite so\nstraight! I do verily believe we are run off with! Stop,\ncoachman!--stop!\"\n\nIn spite of all Miss Perceval's exclamations and vociferations, the\ncarriage flew on with frightful rapidity, though it reeled from side to\nside of the road, as if it had become intoxicated like the driver\nhimself, who lashed his horses and galloped along, within an inch of\nhedges and ditches all the way, till at last, having reached the\nrace-course, he pulled up so suddenly and violently, that the horses\nnearly fell back on their haunches, while he swore at them in the most\nfurious and shocking manner.\n\nLady Rockville now stood up, and spoke to the coachman very severely on\nhis misconduct, in first driving her so dangerously fast, and then being\ndisrespectful enough to use profane language in her presence, adding,\nthat if he did not conduct himself more properly, she must complain to\nLord Rockville as soon as the carriage returned home. Upon hearing this,\nthe man looked exceedingly sulky, and muttered angrily to himself in a\ntipsy voice, till at last he suddenly threw away the reins, and, rising\nfrom the box, he began to scramble his way down, nearly falling to the\nground in his haste, and saying, \"if your ladyship is not pleased with\nmy driving, you may drive yourself!\"\n\nAfter this the intoxicated man staggered towards a drinking-booth not\nfar off, and disappeared, leaving Miss Perceval perfectly planet-struck\nwith astonishment, and actually dumb during several minutes with wonder,\nat all she heard and saw. There sat Harry, alone on the dicky, behind\ntwo spirited blood-horses, foaming at the mouth with the speed at which\nthey had come, and ready to start off again at the slightest hint, while\nnoises on every side were to be heard enough to frighten a pair of\nhobby-horses. Piemen ringing their bells--blind fiddlers playing out of\ntune--boys calling lists of the horses--drums beating at the\nstarting-post--ballad singers squalling at the full pitch of their\nvoices--horses galloping--grooms quarrelling--dogs barking--and children\ncrying.\n\nIn the midst of all this uproar, Harry unexpectedly observed Captain\nDigby on horseback not far off. Without losing a moment, he stood up,\nwaving his handkerchief, and calling to beg he would come to the\ncarriage immediately, as they were in want of assistance; and Lady\nRockville told, as soon as he arrived, though hardly able to help\nlaughing while she explained it, the extraordinary predicament they had\nbeen placed in. Captain Digby, upon hearing the story, looked ready to\ngo off like a squib with rage at the offending coachman, and instantly\nseizing the driving-whip, he desired his servant to hold the horses'\nheads, while he proceeded towards the drinking-booth, flourishing the\nlong lash in his hand as he went in a most ominous manner. Several\nminutes elapsed, during which Harry overheard a prodigious outcry in the\ntent, and then the drunken coachman was seen reeling away along the\nroad, while Captain Digby, still brandishing the whip, returned, and\nmounting the dicky himself, he gathered up the reins, and insisted on\ndriving Lady Rockville's phaeton for her. Before long it was ranged\nclose beside a chariot so full of ladies, it seemed ready to burst, when\nHarry was amused to perceive that Peter Grey and another boy, who were\nseated on the rumble behind, had spread a table-cloth on the roof of the\ncarriage, using it for a dining-table, while they all seemed determined\nto astonish their appetites by the quantity of oysters and sandwiches\nthey ate, and by drinking at the same time large tumblers of porter.\nLady Rockville wished she could have the loan of Harry and Laura's\nspirits for an hour or two, when she saw how perfectly bewildered with\ndelight they were on beholding the thousands of eager persons assembled\non the race-ground,--jockeys riding about in liveries as gay as\ntulips--officers in scarlet uniform--red flags fluttering in the\nbreeze--caravans exhibiting pictures of the wildest-looking beasts in\nthe world--bands of music--recruiting parties--fire-eaters, who dined on\nred-hot pokers--portraits representing pigs fatter than the fattest in\nthe world--giants a head and three pair of shoulders taller than any\none else, and little dwarfs, scarcely visible with the naked eye--all of\nwhich were shown to children for half price!\n\nLady Rockville very good naturedly gave Harry half-a-crown, promising\nthat, before leaving the race-ground, he should either buy some oranges\nto lay the dust in his throat after so long a drive, or visit as many\nshows as he pleased for his half-crown; and they were anxiously\ndiscussing what five sights would be worth sixpence each, when a loud\nhurra was heard, the drums beat, and five horses started off for the\nfirst heat. Harry stood up in an ecstacy of delight, and spoke loudly in\nadmiration of the jockey on a grey horse, with a pink jacket, who took\nthe lead, and seemed perfectly to fly, as if he need never touch the\nground; but Harry exclaimed angrily against the next rider, in a yellow\ndress and green cap, who pulled back his own bay horse, as if he really\nwished to lose. To Laura's astonishment, however, Captain Digby\npreferred him, and Miss Perceval declared in favour of a light-blue\njacket and chesnut horse. Harry now thought everybody stupid not to\nagree with him, and called out in the height of his eagerness, \"I would\nbet this half-crown upon the pink jacket!\"\n\n\"Done!\" cried Peter, laughing. \"The yellow dress and green cap for my\nmoney!\"\n\n\"Then I shall soon have five shillings!\" exclaimed Harry in great glee;\nbut scarcely had he spoken, before a loud murmuring sound arose among\nthe surrounding crowd, upon hearing which he looked anxiously about, and\nwas astonished to see the green cap and yellow dress already at the\nwinning-post, while his own favourite grey horse cantered slowly along,\nfar behind all the others, carrying the jockey in the pink jacket, who\nhung his head, and was bent nearly double, with shame and fatigue.\n\nPeter Grey gave a loud laugh of triumph when he glanced at Harry's\ndisappointed angry countenance, and held out his hand for the\nhalf-crown, saying, \"Pay your debt of honour, Master Harry! It is rather\nfortunate I won, seeing that not one sixpence had I to have paid you\nwith! not a penny to jingle on a mile-stone. You had more money than\nwit, and I had more wit than money, so we are well met. Did you not see\nthat the grey horse had fallen lame? Good-bye, youngster! I shall tell\nall the giants and wild beasts to expect you another day!\"\n\n\"Harry!\" said Lady Rockville, looking gravely at his enraged\ncountenance, \"it is a foolish fish that is caught with every bait! I am\nquite relieved that you lost that money. This is an early lesson against\ngambling, and no one can ever be rich or happy who becomes fond of it.\nWe were wrong to bring you here at all; and I now see you could easily\nbe led into that dreadful vice, which has caused misery and ruin to\nthousands of young men. If you had possessed an estate, it would have\nbeen thrown away quite as foolishly as the poor half-crown, making you\nperhaps miserable afterwards for life.\"\n\n\"I thought myself quite sure to win!\" exclaimed Harry, still looking\nwith angry astonishment after Peter, who was making odd grimaces, and\nholding up the half-crown in a most teazing manner. \"I would rather have\nthrown my money into the sea than given it to Peter.\"\n\n\"Think, too, how many pleasanter and better ways there are, in which you\nmight have spent it!\" added Lady Rockville. \"Look at that poor blind man\nwhom you could have relieved, or consider what a nice present you should\nhave given to Laura! But there seem to be no more brains in your head,\nHarry, than in her thimble!\"\n\n\"Peter is quite a little black-leg already,\" observed Miss Perceval. \"I\nnever saw such a boy! So fond of attracting notice, that he would put on\na cap and bells if that would make him stared at. Last Saturday he\nundertook for a bet to make a ceremonious bow to every lamp-post along\nPrince's Street, and I wish you could have seen the wondering crowd that\ngradually collected as he went along, performing his task with the most\nperfect composure and impudence.\"\n\n\"For cool assurance, I hope there are not many boys equal to him,\" said\nLady Rockville. \"He scattered out of the window lately several red-hot\nhalf-pence, among some beggars, and I am told they perfectly stuck to\nthe poor creatures' fingers when trying to pick them up; and he was sent\na message, on his pony, one very cold day lately, to Lady De Vere's, who\noffered, when he was taking leave, to cut him one of her finest\ncamellias, to which he replied, 'I would much rather you offered me a\nhot potatoe!'\"\n\n\"Peter feels no sympathy in your disappointment, Harry,\" added Miss\nPerceval; \"but we might as well expect wool on a dog, as friendship from\na gambler, who would ruin his own father, and always laughs at those who\nlose.\"\n\n\"Go and cut your wisdom teeth, Harry!\" said Captain Digby, smiling. \"Any\none must have been born blind not to observe that the grey horse was\nfalling behind; but you have bought half-a-crown's worth of wisdom by\nexperience, and I hope it will last for life. Never venture to bet even\nthat your own head is on your shoulders, or it may turn out a mistake.\"\n\n\"Harry is now the monkey that has seen the world, and I think it will be\na whole year of Saturdays before he ever commits such a blunder again,\"\ncontinued Lady Rockville. \"We must for this once, not complain of what\nhas occurred to Lady Harriet, because she would be exceedingly\ndispleased, but certainly you are a most ingenious little gentleman for\ngetting into scrapes!\"\n\nHarry told upon himself, however, on his return home, because he had\nalways been accustomed to do so, knowing Major Graham and his grandmama\nwere never very angry at any fault that was confessed and repented of,\ntherefore he went straight up stairs, and related his whole history to\nuncle David, who gave him a very serious exhortation against the foolish\nand sinful vice of gambling. To keep him in mind of his silly adventure\nthat day, Harry was also desired, during the whole evening, to wear his\ncoat turned inside out, a very frequent punishment administered by Major\nGraham for small offences, and which was generally felt to be a terrible\ndisgrace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE UNEXPECTED EVENT.\n\n  His shout may ring upon the hill,\n  His voice be echoed in the hall,\n  His merry laugh like music trill,\n  I scarcely notice such things now.\n\n                                        Willis.\n\n\nSome weeks after Frank had left home, while lady Harriet and Major\nGraham were absent at Holiday House, Harry and Laura felt surprised to\nobserve, that Mrs. Crabtree suddenly became very grave and silent,--her\nvoice seemed to have lost half its loudness,--her countenance looked\nrather pale,--and they both escaped being scolded on several occasions,\nwhen Harry himself could not but think he deserved it. Once or twice he\nventured to do things that at other times he dared not have attempted,\n\"merely as an experiment,\" he said, \"like that man in the menagerie, who\nput his head into the lion's mouth, without feeling quite sure whether\nit would be bit off the next moment or not;\" but though Mrs. Crabtree\nevidently saw all that passed, she turned away with a look of sadness,\nand said not a word.\n\nWhat could be the matter? Harry almost wished she would fly into a good\npassion and scold him, it became so extraordinary and unnatural to see\nMrs. Crabtree sitting all day in a corner of the room, sewing in\nsilence, and scarcely looking up from her work; but still the wonder\ngrew, for she seemed to become worse and worse every day. Harry dressed\nup the cat in an old cap and frock of Laura's,--he terrified old Jowler\nby putting him into the shower-bath,--and let off a few crackers at the\nnursery window,--but it seemed as if he might have fired a cannon\nwithout being scolded by Mrs. Crabtree, who merely turned her head round\nfor a minute, and then silently resumed her work. Laura even fancied\nthat Mrs. Crabtree was once in tears, but that seemed quite impossible,\nso she thought no more about it, till one morning, when they had begun\nto despair of ever hearing more about the business, and were whispering\ntogether in a corner of the room, observing that she looked duller than\never, they were surprised to hear Mrs. Crabtree calling them both to\ncome near her. She looked very pale, and was beginning to say something,\nwhen her voice suddenly became so husky and indistinct, that she seemed\nunable to proceed; therefore, motioning with her hand for them to go\naway, she began sewing very rapidly, as she had done before, breaking\nher threads, and pricking her fingers, at every stitch.\n\nLaura and Harry silently looked at each other with some apprehension,\nand the nursery now became so perfectly still, that a feather falling on\nthe ground would have been heard. This had continued for some time, when\nat last Laura upon tiptoe stole quietly up to where Mrs. Crabtree was\nsitting, and said to her, in a very kind and anxious voice, \"I am afraid\nyou are not well, Mrs. Crabtree! Grandmama will send for a doctor when\nshe comes home. Shall I ask her?\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Miss Laura!--never mind me! Your grandmama knows\nwhat is the matter. It will be all one a hundred years hence,\" answered\nMrs. Crabtree, in a low husky voice. \"This is a thing you will be very\nglad to hear!--you must prepare to be told some good news!\" added she,\nforcing a laugh, but such a laugh as Harry and Laura never heard\nbefore, for it sounded so much more like sorrow than joy. They waited in\ngreat suspense to hear what would follow, but Mrs. Crabtree, after\nstruggling to speak again with composure, suddenly started off her seat,\nand hurried rapidly out of the room. She appeared no more in the nursery\nthat day, but next morning when they were at breakfast, she entered the\nroom with her face very much covered up in her bonnet, and evidently\ntried to speak in her usual loud bustling voice, though somehow it still\nsounded perfectly different from common. \"Well, children! Lady Harriet\nwas so kind as to promise that my secret should be kept till I pleased,\nand that no one should mention it to you but myself. I am going away!\"\n\n\"You!\" exclaimed Harry, looking earnestly in Mrs. Crabtree's face. \"Are\nyou going away?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Harry,--I leave this house to-day! Now, don't pretend to\nlook sorry! I know you are not! I can't bear children to tell stories.\nWho would ever be sorry for a cross old woman like me?\"\n\n\"But perhaps I am sorry! Are you in real earnest going away?\" asked\nHarry again, with renewed astonishment. \"Oh no! it is only a joke!\"\n\n\"Do I look as if this were a joke?\" asked Mrs. Crabtree, turning round\nher face, which was bathed with tears. \"No, no! I am come to bid you\nboth a long farewell. A fine mess you will get into now! All your things\ngoing to rack and ruin, with nobody fit to look after them!\"\n\n\"But, Mrs. Crabtree! we do not like you to go away,\" said Laura, kindly.\n\"Why are you leaving us all on a sudden? it is very odd! I never was so\nsurprised in my life!\"\n\n\"Your papa's orders are come. He wrote me a line some weeks ago, to say\nthat I have been too severe. Perhaps that is all true. I meant it well,\nand we are poor creatures, who can only act for the best. However, it\ncan't be helped now! There's no use in lamenting over spilt cream.\nYou'll be the better behaved afterwards. If ever you think of me again,\nchildren, let it be as kindly as possible. Many and many a time I shall\nremember you both. I never cared for any young people but yourselves,\nand I shall never take charge of any others. Master Frank was the best\nboy in the world, and you would both have been as good under my\ncare,--but it is no matter now!\"\n\n\"But it does matter a very great deal,\" cried Harry, eagerly. \"You must\nstay here, Mrs. Crabtree, as long as you live, and a great deal longer!\nI shall write a letter to papa all about it. We were very troublesome,\nand it was our own faults if we were punished. Never mind, Mrs.\nCrabtree, but take off your bonnet and sit down! I am going to do some\ndreadful mischief to-night, so you will be wanted to keep me in order.\"\n\nMrs. Crabtree laid her hand upon Harry's head in silence, and there was\nsomething so solemn and serious in her manner, that he saw it would be\nuseless to remonstrate any more. She then held out her hand to Laura,\nendeavouring to smile as she did so, but it was a vain attempt, for her\nlip quivered, and she turned away, saying, \"Who would ever believe I\nshould make such a fool of myself! Farewell to you both! and let nobody\nspeak ill of me after I am gone, if you can help it!\"\n\nWithout looking round, Mrs. Crabtree hurried out of the nursery and\nclosed the door, leaving Harry and Laura perfectly bewildered with\nastonishment at this sudden event, which seemed more like a dream than a\nreality. They both felt exceedingly melancholy, hardly able to believe\nthat she had formerly been at all cross, while they stood at the window\nwith tears in their eyes, watching the departure of her well-known blue\nchest, on a wheel-barrow, and taking a last look of her red gown and\nscarlet shawl as she hastily followed it.\n\nFor several weeks to come, whenever the door opened, Harry and Laura\nalmost expected her to enter, but month after month elapsed, and Mrs.\nCrabtree appeared no more, till one day, at their earnest entreaty, Lady\nHarriet took them a drive of some miles into the country, to see the\nneat little lodging by the sea-side where she lived, and maintained\nherself by sewing, and by going out occasionally as a sick-nurse. A more\ndelightful surprise certainly never could have been given than when\nHarry and Laura tapped at the cottage door, which was opened by Mrs.\nCrabtree herself, who started back with an exclamation of joyful\namazement, and looked as if she could scarcely believe her eyes on\nbeholding them, while they laughed at the joke till tears were running\ndown their cheeks. \"Is Mrs. Crabtree at home?\" said Harry, trying to\nlook very grave.\n\n\"Grandmama says we may stay here for an hour, while she drives along the\nshore,\" added Laura, stepping into the house with a very merry face.\n\"And how do you do, Mrs. Crabtree?\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss Laura, and very happy to see you. What a tall girl you\nare become! and Master Harry too! looking quite over his own shoulders!\"\n\nAfter sitting some time, Mrs. Crabtree insisted on their having some\ndinner in her cottage; so making Harry and Laura sit down on each side\nof a large blazing fire, she cooked some most delicious pancakes for\nthem in rapid succession, as fast as they could eat, tossing them high\nin the air first, and then rolling up each as it was fried, with a large\nspoonful of jam in the centre, till Harry and Laura at last said, that\nunless Mrs. Crabtree supplied fresh appetites, she need make no more\npancakes, for they thought even Peter Grey himself could scarcely have\nfinished all she provided.\n\nHarry had now been several months constantly attending school, where he\nbecame a great favourite with the boys, and a great torment to the\nmasters, while, for his own part, he liked it twenty times better than\nhe had expected, because the lessons were tolerably easy to a clever\nboy, as he really was, and the games at cricket and foot-ball in the\nplay-ground put him perfectly wild with joy. Every boy at school seemed\nto be his particular friend, and many called him \"the holiday-maker,\"\nbecause, if ever a holiday was wished for, Harry always became leader in\nthe scheme. The last morning of Peter Grey's appearing at school, he got\nthe name of \"the copper captain,\" because Mr. Lexicon having fined him\nhalf-a-crown, for not knowing one of his lessons, he brought the whole\nsum in half-pence, carrying them in his hat, and gravely counting them\nall out, with such a pains-taking, good-boy look, that any one, to see\nhim, would have supposed he was quite penitent and sorry for his\nmisconduct; but no sooner had he finished the task and ranged all the\nhalf-pence neatly in rows along Mr. Lexicon's desk, than he was desired,\nin a voice of thunder, to leave the room instantly, and never to return,\nwhich accordingly he never did, having started next day on the top of\nthe coach for Portsmouth, and the last peep Harry got of him, he was\nbuying a perfect mountain of gingerbread out of an old man's basket, to\neat by the way.\n\nMeantime Laura had lessons from a regular day-governess, who came every\nmorning at seven, and never disappeared till four in the afternoon, so,\nas Mrs. Crabtree remarked, \"the puir thing was perfectly deaved wi'\nedication,\" but she made such rapid progress, that uncle David said it\nwould be difficult to decide whether she was growing fastest in body or\nin mind. Laura seemed born to be under the tuition of none but\nill-tempered people, and Madame Pirouette appeared in a constant state\nof irritability. During the music-lessons, she sat close to the piano,\nwith a pair of sharp-pointed scissors in her hand, and whenever Laura\nplayed a wrong note, she stuck their points into the offending finger,\nsaying sometimes in an angry foreign accent, \"put your toe upon 'dis\nnote! I tell you, put your toe upon 'dis note!\"\n\n\"My finger, I suppose you mean?\" asked Laura, trying not to laugh.\n\n\"Ah! fingare and toe! dat is all one! Speak not a word! take hold of\nyour tongue.\"\n\n\"Laura!\" said Major Graham, one day, \"I would as soon hear a gong\nsounded at my ear for half an hour, as most of the fine pieces you\nperform now. Taste and expression are quite out of date, but the chief\nobject of ambition is, to seem as if you had four hands instead of two,\nfrom the torrent of notes produced at once. If ever you wish to please\nmy old-fashioned ears, give me melody,--something that touches the heart\nand dwells in the memory,--then years afterwards, when we hear it again,\nthe language seems familiar to our feelings, and we listen with deep\ndelight to sounds recalling a thousand recollections of former days,\nwhich are brought back by music (real music) with distinctness and\ninterest which nothing else can equal.\"\n\nDuring more than two years, while Harry and Laura were rapidly advancing\nin education, they received many interesting letters from Frank,\nexpressing the most affectionate anxiety to hear of their being well and\nhappy, while his paper was filled with amusing accounts of the various\nwonderful countries he visited; and at the bottom of the paper, he\nalways very kindly remembered to send them an order on his banker, as he\ncalled uncle David, drawn up in proper form, saying, \"Please to pay\nMaster Harry and Miss Laura Graham the sum of five shillings on my\naccount. Francis Arthur Graham.\"\n\nIn Frank's gay, merry epistles, he kept all his little annoyances or\nvexations to himself, and invariably took up the pen with such a desire\nto send cheerfulness into his own beloved home, that his letters might\nhave been written with a sun-beam, they were so full of warmth and\nvivacity. It seemed always a fair wind to Frank, for he looked upon the\nbest side of every thing, and never teazed his absent friends with\ncomplaints of distresses they could not remedy, except when he\nfrequently mentioned his sorrow at being separated from them, adding,\nthat he often wished it were possible to meet them during one day in\nevery year, to tell all his thoughts, and to hear theirs in return, for\nsometimes now, during the night watches, when all other resources\nfailed, he entertained himself, by imagining the circle of home all\ngathered around him, and by inventing what each individual would say\nupon any subjects he liked, while all his adventures acquired a double\ninterest, from considering that the recital would one day amuse his dear\nfriends when their happy meeting at last took place. Frank was not so\nover-anxious about his own comfort, as to feel very much irritated and\ndiscomposed at any privations that fell in his way, and once sitting up\nin the middle of a dark night, with the rain pouring in torrents, and\nthe wind blowing a perfect hurricane, he drew his watch-coat round him,\nsaying good humouredly to his grumbling companions, \"This is by no means\nso bad! and whatever change takes place now, will probably be for the\nbetter. Sunshine is as sure to come as Christmas, if you only wait for\nit, and in the meantime we are all more comfortably off than St.\nPatrick, when he had to swim across a stormy sea, with his head under\nhis arm.\"\n\nFrank often amused his messmates with stories which he had heard from\nuncle David, and soon became the greatest favourite imaginable with them\nall, while he frequently endeavoured to lead their minds to the same\nsure foundation of happiness which he always found the best security of\nhis own. He had long been taught to know that a vessel might as well be\nsteered without rudder or compass, as any individual be brought into a\nhaven of peace, unless directed by the Holy Scriptures; and his delight\nwas frequently to study such passages as these: \"When thou passest\nthrough the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they\nshall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt\nnot be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the\nLord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. AN UNEXPECTED VOYAGE.\n\n  Full little know'st thou, that hast not tried,\n  How strange it is in \"steam-boat\" long to bide,--\n  To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares,\n  To eat thy heart through comfortless despairs,\n  To speed to-day--to be put back to-morrow--\n  To feed on hope--to pine with fear and sorrow.\n\n                                        Spenser.\n\n\nAs Harry and Laura grew older, they were gradually treated like friends\nand companions by Lady Harriet and Major Graham, who improved their\nminds by frequent interesting conversations, in which knowledge and\nprinciple were insensibly instilled into their minds, not by formal\ninstruction, but merely by mentioning facts, or expressing opinions and\nsentiments such as naturally arose out of the subjects under discussion,\nand accustoming the young people themselves to feel certain that their\nown remarks and thoughts were to be heard with the same interest as\nthose of any other person. No surprise was expressed, if they appeared\nmore acute or more amusing than might have been expected,--no angry\ncontempt betrayed itself if they spoke foolishly, unless it were\nsomething positively wrong; and thus Major Graham and Lady Harriet\nsucceeded in making that very difficult transition from treating\nchildren as toys, to becoming their confidential friends, and most\ntrusted, as well as most respected and beloved associates.\n\nFrank had been upwards of five years cruizing on various stations\nabroad, and many officers who had seen him, gave such agreeable reports\nto Major Graham of his admirable conduct on several occasions, and of\nhis having turned out so extremely handsome and pleasing, that Lady\nHarriet often wished, with tears in her eyes, it were possible she might\nlive to see him once again, though her own daily increasing infirmities\nrendered that hope every hour more improbable. She was told that he\nspoke of her very frequently, and said once when he met an aged person\nat the Cape, \"I would give all I possess on earth, and ten times more,\nif I had it, to see my dear grandmother as well, and to meet her once\nmore.\" This deeply affected Lady Harriet, who was speaking one day with\nunusual earnestness of the comfort it gave, whatever might be the will\nof Providence in respect to herself, that Frank seemed so happy, and\nliked his profession so well, when the door flew open, and Andrew\nhastened into the room, his old face perfectly wrinkled with delight,\nwhile he displayed a letter in his hand, saying in a tone of breathless\nagitation, as he delivered it to Major Graham, \"The post-mark is\nPortsmouth, Sir!\"\n\nLady Harriet nearly rose from her seat with an exclamation of joy, but\nunable for the exertion, she sunk back, covering her face with her\nhands, and listening in speechless suspense to hear whether Frank had\nindeed returned. Harry and Laura eagerly looked over Major Graham's\nshoulder, and Andrew lingered anxiously at the door, till this welcome\nletter was hurriedly torn open and read. The direction was certainly\nFrank's writing, though it seemed very different from usual, but the\ncontents filled Major Graham with a degree of consternation and alarm,\nwhich he vainly endeavoured to conceal, for it informed him that, during\na desperate engagement with some slave-ships off the coast of Africa,\nFrank had been most severely wounded, from which he scarcely recovered\nbefore a violent attack of fever reduced him so extremely, that the\ndoctors declared his only chance of restoration was to be invalided home\nimmediately; \"therefore,\" added he, \"you must all unite a prayer for my\nrecovery, with a thanksgiving for my return, and I can scarcely regret\nan illness that restores me to home. My heart is already with you all,\nbut my frail shattered body must rest some days in London, as the voyage\nfrom Sierra Leone has been extremely fatiguing and tedious.\"\n\nLady Harriet made not a single remark when this letter was closed, but\ntears coursed each other rapidly down her aged cheeks, while she slowly\nremoved her hands from her face, and gazed at Major Graham, who seated\nhimself by her side, in evident agitation, and calling back Andrew when\nhe was leaving the room, he said, in accents of unusual emotion, \"Desire\nJohn to inquire immediately whether any steam-boat sails for London\nto-day.\"\n\n\"You are right!\" said Lady Harriet, feebly. \"Oh! that I could accompany\nyou! But bring him to me if possible. I dare not hope to go. Surely we\nshall meet at last. Now indeed I feel my own weakness, when I cannot fly\nto see him. But he will be quite able for the journey. Frank had an\nexcellent constitution,--he--he was--\"\n\nLady Harriet's voice failed, and she burst into a convulsive agony of\ntears.\n\nA few hours, and uncle David had embarked for London, where, after a\nshort passage, he arrived at his usual lodgings in St. James' Place; but\nsome days elapsed, during which he laboured in vain to discover the\nsmallest trace of Frank, who had omitted, in his hurried letter from\nPortsmouth, to mention where he intended living in town. One evening,\nfatigued with his long and unavailing search, Major Graham sat down, at\nthe British Coffee-house, to take some refreshment before resuming his\ninquiries, and was afterwards about to leave the room, when he observed\na very tall interesting young man, exceedingly emaciated, who strolled\nlanguidly into the room, with so feeble a step, that he scarcely seemed\nable to support himself. The stranger took off his hat, sunk into a\nseat, and passed his fingers through the dark masses of curls that hung\nover his pale white forehead, his large eyes closed heavily with\nfatigue, his cheek assumed a hectic glow, and his head sunk upon his\nhand. In a low subdued voice he gave some directions to the waiter, and\nMajor Graham, after gazing for a moment with melancholy interest at this\napparently consumptive youth, was about to depart, when a turn of the\nyoung man's countenance caused him to start; he looked again more\nearnestly--every fibre of his frame seemed suddenly to thrill with\napprehension, and at last, in a voice of doubt and astonishment, he\nexclaimed, \"Frank!\"\n\nThe stranger sprung from his seat, gazed eagerly round the room, rushed\ninto the arms of Major Graham, and fainted.\n\nLong and anxiously did uncle David watch for the restoration of Frank,\nwhile every means were used to revive him, and when at length he did\nregain his consciousness, no time was lost in conveying him to St.\nJames' Place, where, after being confined to bed, and attended by Sir\nAstley Cooper and Sir Henry Halford, during some days, they united in\nrecommending that he should be carried some miles out of town, to the\nneighbourhood of Hammersmith, for change of air, till the effect of\nmedicine and diet could be fully tried. Frank earnestly entreated that\nhe might be taken immediately to his own home, but this the doctors\npronounced quite impossible, privately hinting to Major Graham that it\nseemed very doubtful indeed whether he could ever be moved there at all,\nor whether he might survive above a few months.\n\n\"Home is anywhere that my own family live with me,\" said Frank in a\ntone of resignation, when he heard a journey to Scotland pronounced\nimpossible. \"It is not where I am, but who I see, that signifies; and\nthis meeting with you, uncle David, did me more good than an ocean of\nphysic. Oh! if I could only converse with grandmama for half-an-hour,\nand speak to dear Harry and Laura, it would be too much happiness. I\nwant to see how much they are both grown, and to hear their merry laugh\nagain. Perhaps I never may! But if I get worse, they must come here. I\nhave many things to say! Why should they not set off now?--immediately!\nIf I recover, we might be such a happy party to Scotland again. For\ngrandmama, I know it is impossible; but will you write and ask her about\nHarry and Laura? The sooner the better, uncle David, because I often\nthink it probable----\"\n\nFrank coloured and hesitated; he looked earnestly at his uncle for some\nmoments, who saw what was meant, and then added,\n\n\"There is one person more, far distant, and little thinking of what is\nto come, who must be told. You have always been a father to me, uncle\nDavid, but he also would wish to be here now. Little as we have been\ntogether, I know how much he loves me.\"\n\nFrank's request became no sooner known than it was complied with by Lady\nHarriet, who thought it better not to distress Harry and Laura, by\nmentioning the full extent of his danger, but merely said, that he felt\nimpatient for the meeting, and that they might prepare on the following\nday, to embark under charge of old Andrew and her own maid Harrison, for\na voyage to London, where she hoped they would find the dear invalid\nalready better; Laura was astonished at the agitation with which she\nspoke, and felt bewildered and amazed by this sudden announcement. She\nand Harry had once or twice in their lives caught cold, and spent a day\nin bed, confined to a diet of gruel and syrup, which always proved an\ninfallible remedy for the very worst attacks, and they had frequently\nwitnessed the severe sufferings of their grandmama, from which, however,\nshe always recovered, and which seemed to them the natural effects of\nher extreme old age; but to imagine the possibility of Frank's life\nbeing in actual danger, never crossed their thoughts for an instant,\nand, therefore, it was with a feeling of unutterable joy that they stood\non the deck of the Royal Pandemonium, knowing that they were now\nactually going to meet Frank.\n\nNothing could be a greater novelty to both the young travellers than the\nscene by which they were now surrounded; trumpets were sounding--bells\nringing--children crying--sailors, passengers, carriages, dogs, and\nbaggage all hurrying on board pell-mell, while a jet of steam came\nbellowing forth from the waste-pipe, as if it were struggling to get rid\nof the huge column of black smoke vomited forth by the chimney. Below\nstairs they were still more astonished to find a large cabin, covered\nwith gilding, red damask, and mirrors, where crowds of strange-looking\npeople, more than half sick, and very cross, were scolding and bustling\nabout, bawling for their carpet bags, and trying to be of as much\nconsequence as possible, while they ate and drank trash, to keep off\nsea-sickness, that might have made any one sick on shore--sipping brandy\nand water, or eating peppermint drops, according as the case required.\nAmong those in the ladies' cabin, Laura and Harry were amused to\ndiscover Miss Perceval, who had hastened into bed already, in case of\nbeing ill, and was talking unceasingly to any one who would listen,\nbesides ordering and scolding a poor sick maid, scarcely able to stand.\nHer head was enveloped in a most singular night-cap, ornamented with old\nribbons and artificial flowers--she wore a bright yellow shawl, and had\ntaken into the berth beside her, a little Blenheim spaniel--a\nparrot--and a cage of canary birds, the noisy inhabitants of which sung\nat the full pitch of their voices till the very latest hour of the\nnight, being kept awake by the lamp which swung from side to side, while\nnothing could be compared to their volubility except the perpetual\nclamour occasioned by Miss Perceval herself.\n\n\"I declare these little narrow beds are no better than coffins! I never\nsaw such places! and the smell is like singed blankets and cabbages\nboiled in melted oil! It is enough to make anybody ill! Mary! go and\nfetch me a cup of tea, and, do you hear! tell those people on deck not\nto make such a noise--it gives me a headache! Be sure you say that I\nshall complain to the Captain. Reach me some bread and milk for the\nparrot,--fetch my smelling bottle,--go to the saloon for that book I was\nreading,--and search again for the pocket-handkerchief I mislaid. It\ncost ten guineas, and must be found. I hope no one has stolen it! Now do\nmake haste with the tea! What are you dawdling there for? If you do not\nstop that noise on deck, Mary, I shall be exceedingly displeased! Some\nof those horrid people in the steerage were smoking too, but tell the\nCaptain that if I come up he must forbid them. It is a trick to make us\nall sick and save provisions. I observed a gun-case in the saloon too,\nwhich is a most dangerous thing, for guns always go off when you least\nexpect. If any one fires, I shall fall into hysterics. I shall, indeed!\nWhat a creaking noise the vessel makes! I hope there is no danger of its\nsplitting! We ought not to go on sailing after dusk. The Captain must\npositively cast anchor during the night, that we may have no more of\nthis noise or motion, but sleep in peace and quietness till morning.\"\n\nSoon after the Royal Pandemonium had set sail, or rather set fire, the\nwind freshened, and the pitching of the vessel became so rough, that\nHarry and Laura, with great difficulty, staggered to seats on the deck,\nleaving both Lady Harriet's servants so very sick below, that instead of\nbeing able to attend on them, they gave nine times the trouble that any\nother passenger did on board, and were not visible again during the\nwhole voyage. The two young travellers now sat down together, and\nwatched, with great curiosity, several groups of strangers on deck:\nladies, half sick, trying to entertain gentlemen in seal-skin travelling\ncaps and pale cadaverous countenances, smoking cigars; others opening\nbaskets of provisions, and eating with good sea-faring appetite; while\none party had a carriage on the deck so filled with luxuries of every\nkind, that there seemed no end to the multitude of Perigord pies, German\nsausages, cold fowls, pastry, and fruit that were produced during the\nevening. The owners had a table spread on the deck, and ate voraciously,\nbefore a circle of hungry spectators, which had such an appearance of\nselfishness and gluttony, that both his young friends thought\nimmediately of Peter Grey.\n\nAs evening closed in, Harry and Laura began to feel very desolate thus\nfor the first time in their lives alone, while the wide waste of waters\naround made the scene yet more forlorn. They had enjoyed unmingled\ndelight in talking over and over about their happy meeting with Frank,\nand planned a hundred times how joyfully they would rush into the house,\nand with what pleasure they would relate all that happened to\nthemselves, after hearing from his own mouth the extraordinary\nadventures which his letters had described. Laura produced from her\nreticule several of the last she had received, and laughed again over\nthe funny jokes and stories they contained, inventing many new questions\nto ask him on the subject, and fancying she already heard his voice, and\nsaw his bright and joyous countenance. But now the night had grown so\ndark and chilly, that both Harry and Laura felt themselves gradually\nbecoming cold, melancholy, and dejected. They made an effort to walk\narm-in-arm up and down the deck, in imitation of the few other\npassengers who had been able to remain out of bed, and they tried still\nto talk cheerfully, but in spite of every effort, their thoughts became\nmournful. After clinging together for some time, and staggering up and\ndown, without feeling in spirits to speak, they were still shiveringly\ncold, yet unwilling to separate for the night, when Harry suddenly stood\nstill, grasping Laura's arm with a look of startled astonishment, which\ncaused her hastily to glance round in the direction where he was eagerly\ngazing, but nothing became visible except the dim outline of a woman's\nfigure, rolled up in several enormous shawls, and with her bonnet\nslouched far over her face.\n\n\"I am certain it was her!\" whispered Harry, in a tone of breathless\namazement; \"almost certain!\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Laura, eagerly.\n\nWithout answering, Harry sprung forward, and seized the unknown person\nby the arm, who instantly looked round.----IT WAS MRS. CRABTREE!\n\n\"I am sorry you observed me, Master Harry! I did not intend to trouble\nyou and Miss Laura during the voyage,\" said she, turning her face slowly\ntowards him, when, to his surprise, he saw that the traces of tears were\non her cheek, and her manner appeared so subdued, and altogether so\ndifferent from former times, that Laura could scarcely yet credit her\nsenses. \"I shall not be at all in your way, children, but I ---- ---- I\nmust see Master Frank again. He was always too good for this world, and\nhe'll not be here long--Andrew told me all about it, and I could not\nstay behind. I wish we were all as well prepared, and then the sooner we\ndie the better.\"\n\nHarry and Laura listened in speechless consternation to these words. The\nvery idea of losing Frank had never before crossed their imaginations\nfor a moment, and they could have wished to believe that what Mrs.\nCrabtree said was like the ravings of delirium, yet an irresistible\nfeeling of awe and alarm rushed into their minds.\n\n\"Miss Laura! if you want any help in undressing, call to me at any time.\nI was sure that doited body Harrison could be of no service. She never\nwas fit to take care of herself, and far less of such as you. It put me\nwild to think of your coming all this way with nobody fit to look after\nyou, and then the distress that must follow.\"\n\n\"But surely, Mrs. Crabtree, you do not think Frank so very ill,\" asked\nLaura, making an effort to recover her voice, and speaking in a tone of\ndeep anxiety; \"he had recovered from the fever, but is only rather too\nweak for travelling.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Laura! grief always comes too soon, and I would have held my\ntongue had I thought you did not know the worst already. If I might\norder as in former days, it would be to send you both down directly, out\nof this heavy fog and cold wind.\"\n\n\"But you may order us, Mrs. Crabtree,\" said Harry, taking her kindly by\nthe hand; \"we are very glad to see you again! and I shall do whatever\nyou bid me! So you came all this way on purpose for us! How very kind!\"\n\n\"Master Harry, I would go round the wide world to serve any one of you!\nwho else have I to care for? But it was chiefly to see Master Frank. Let\nus hope the best, and pray to be prepared for any event that may come.\nAll things are ordained for good, and we can only make the best of what\nhappens. The world must go round,--it must go round, and we can't\nprevent it.\"\n\nHarry and Laura hung their heads in dismay, for there was something\nagitated and solemn in Mrs. Crabtree's manner, which astonished and\nshocked them, so they hurried silently to bed; and Laura's pillow was\ndrenched with tears of anxiety and distress that night, though\ngradually, as she thought of Frank's bright colour and sparkling eyes,\nhis joyous spirits and unbroken health, it seemed impossible that all\nwere so soon to fade away, that the wind should have already passed\nover them, and they were gone, till by degrees her mind became more\ncalm; her hopes grew into certainties; she told herself twenty times\nover, that Mrs. Crabtree must be entirely mistaken, and at last sunk\ninto a restless agitated slumber.\n\nNext day the sun shone, the sky was clear, and every thing appeared so\nfull of life and joy, that Harry and Laura would have fancied the whole\nscene with Mrs. Crabtree a distressing dream, had they not been awakened\nto recollection before six in the morning, by the sound of her voice,\nangrily rebuking Miss Perceval and other ladies, who with too good\nreason, were grumbling at the hardship of sleeping, or rather vainly\nattempting to sleep, in such narrow uncomfortable dog-holes. Laura heard\nMrs. Crabtree conclude an eloquent oration on the subject of\ncontentment, by saying, \"Indeed, ladies! many a brave man, and\nnoblemen's sons too, have laid their heads on the green grass, fighting\nfor you, so we should put up with a hard bed patiently for one night.\"\n\nMiss Perceval turned angrily away, and summoned her maid to receive a\nmultitude of new directions. \"Mary, tell the Captain that when I looked\nout last, there was scarcely any smoke coming out of the funnel, so I am\nsure he is saving fuel, and not keeping good enough fires to carry us\non! I never knew such shabbiness! Tell the engineer, that I insist on\nhis throwing on more coals immediately. Bring me some hot water, as fast\nas possible! These towels are so coarse, I cannot, on any account, use\nthem. After being accustomed to such pocket-handkerchiefs as mine, at\nten guineas each, one does become particular. Can you not find a larger\nbasin? This looks like a soup-plate, and it seems impossible here to get\nenough of hot water to wash comfortably.\"\n\n\"She should be put into the boiler of the steam-boat,\" muttered Mrs.\nCrabtree. \"I wish them animal-magnifying doctors would put the young\nlady to sleep till we arrive in London.\"\n\n\"Now!\" continued Miss Perceval, \"get me another cup of tea. The last was\ntoo sweet, the one before not strong enough, and the first half cold,\nbut this is worse than any. Do remember to mention, that yesterday night\nthe steward sent up a tin tea-pot, a thing I cannot possibly suffer\nagain. We must have the urn, too, instead of that black tea-kettle; and\ndesire him to prepare some butter-toast--I am not hungry, so three\nrounds will be enough. Let me have some green tea this time; and see\nthat the cream is better than last night, when I am certain it was\nthickened with chalk or snails. The jelly, too, was execrable, for it\ntasted like sticking-plaster--I shall starve if better can't be had; and\nthe table-cloth looked like a pair of old sheets. Tell the steward all\nthis, and say, he must get my breakfast ready on deck in half an hour;\nbut meantime, I shall sit here with a book while you brush my hair.\"\n\nThe sick persecuted maid seemed anxious to do all she was bid; so, after\ndelivering as many of the messages as possible, she tried to stand up\nand do Miss Perceval's hair, but the motion of the vessel had greatly\nincreased, and she turned as pale as death, apparently on the point of\nsinking to the ground, when Laura, now quite dressed, quietly slipped\nthe brush out of her hand, and carefully brushed Miss Perceval's thin\nlocks, while poor Mary silently dropped upon a seat, being perfectly\nfaint with sickness.\n\nMiss Perceval read on, without observing the change of abigails, till\nHarry, who had watched this whole scene from the cabin-door, made a\nhissing noise, such as grooms do when they currycomb a horse, which\ncaused the young lady to look hastily round, when great was Miss\nPerceval's astonishment to discover her new abigail, with a very\npains-taking look, brushing her hair, while poor Mary lay more dead than\nalive on the benches. \"Well! I declare! was there ever anything so\nodd!\" she exclaimed in a voice of amazement. \"How very strange! What can\nbe the matter with Mary! There is no end to the plague of servants!\"\n\n\"Or rather to the plague of mistresses!\" thought Laura, while she\nglanced from Miss Perceval's round, red bustling face, to the poor\nsuffering maid, who became worse and worse during the day, for there\ncame on what sailors call \"a capful of wind,\" which gradually rose to a\n\"stiff breeze,\" or, what the passengers considered a hurricane; and,\ntowards night, it attained the dignity of a real undeniable \"storm.\" A\nscene of indescribable tumult then ensued. The Captain attempted to make\nhis voice heard above the roaring tempest, using a torrent of\nunintelligible nautical phrases, and an incessant volley of very\nintelligible oaths. The sailors flew about, and every plank in the\nvessel seemed creaking and straining, but high above all, the shrill\ntones of Miss Perceval were audibly heard, exclaiming,\n\n\"Are there enough of 'hands' on board? Is there any danger? Are you sure\nthe boiler will not burst? I wish steam-boats had never been invented!\nPeople are sure to be blown up to the clouds, or sunk to the bottom of\nthe ocean, or scalded to death like so many lobsters. I cannot stand\nthis any longer! Stop the ship, and set me on shore instantly!\"\n\nLaura clung closer to Harry, and felt that they were like two mere\npigmies, amid the wide waste of waters, rolling and tossing around them,\nwhile his spirits, on the contrary, rose to the highest pitch of\nexcitement with all he heard and saw, till at length, wishing to enjoy\nmore of the \"fun,\" he determined to venture above board. By the time\nHarry's nose was on a level with the deck, he gazed around, and saw that\nnot a person appeared visible except two sailors, both lashed to the\nhelm, while all was silent now, except the deafening noise made by the\nwild waves and the stormy blast, which seemed as if it would blow his\nteeth down his throat. Harry thought the two men looked no larger than\nmice in such a scene, and stood, clinging to the bannisters, perfectly\nentranced with astonishment and admiration at the novelty of all he saw,\nand thinking how often Frank must have been in such scenes, when\nsuddenly a wave washed quite over the deck, and he felt his arm grasped\nby Mrs. Crabtree, who desired him to come down immediately, in a tone of\nauthority which he did not even yet feel bold enough to disobey;\ntherefore, slowly and reluctantly he descended to the cabin, where the\nonly living thing that seemed well enough to move, was Miss Perceval's\ntongue.\n\n\"Steward!\" she cried, in sharp angry accents. \"Steward! here is water\npouring down the sky-lights like a shower-bath! Look at my band-box\nswimming on the floor! Mary! Tiresome creature! don't you see that? My\nbest bonnet will be destroyed! Send the Captain here! He must positively\nstop that noise on deck; it is quite intolerable. My head aches, as if\nit would burst like the boiler of a steam-boat! Stupid man! Can't he put\ninto some port, or cast anchor? How can he keep us all uncomfortable in\nthis way! Mary! Mary, I say! are you deaf? Steward! send one of the\nsailors here to take care of this dog! I declare poor Frisk is going to\nbe sick! Mary! Mary! This is insufferable! I wish the Captain would come\nand help me to scold my maid! I shall certainly give you warning, Mary.\"\n\nThis awful threat had but little effect on one who thought herself on\nthe brink of being buried beneath the waves, besides being too sick to\ncare whether she died the next minute or not; and even Miss Perceval's\nvoice became drowned at last in the tremendous storm which raged\nthroughout the night, during which the Captain rather increased Laura's\npanic, if that were possible, by considerately putting his head into the\ncabin now and then to say, \"Don't be afraid, ladies! There is no\ndanger!\"\n\n\"But I must come up and see what you are about, Captain!\" exclaimed Miss\nPerceval.\n\n\"You had better be still, ma'am,\" replied Mrs. Crabtree. \"It is as well\nto be drowned in bed as on deck.\"\n\nNothing gives a more awful idea of the helplessness of man, and the\nwrath of God, than a tempestuous sea during the gloom of midnight; and\nevery mind on board became awed into silence and solemnity during this\nwar of elements, till at length, towards morning, while the hurricane\nseemed yet raging with undiminished fury, Laura suddenly gave an\nexclamation of rapture, on hearing a sailor at the helm begin to sing\nTom Bowling. \"Now I feel sure the danger is over,\" said she, \"otherwise\nthat man could not have the heart to sing! If I live a century, I shall\nalways like a sailor's song for the future.\"\n\nIt is seldom that any person's thankfulness after danger bears a fair\nproportion to the fear they felt while it lasted; but Harry and Laura\nhad been taught to remember where their gratitude was due, and felt it\nthe more deeply next day, when they entered the Yarmouth Roads, and were\nshewn the masts of several vessels, appearing partly above the water,\nwhich had on various occasions, been lost in that wilderness of shoals,\nwhere so many melancholy catastrophes have occurred.\n\nAfter sailing up the Thames, and duly staring at Greenwich hospital, the\nhulks, and the Tower of London, they landed at last; and having offered\nMrs. Crabtree a place in the hackney coach, they hurried impatiently\ninto it, eager for the happy moment of meeting with Frank. Harry, in his\nardour, thought that no carriage had ever driven so slowly before. He\nwished there had been a rail-road through the town; and far from wasting\na thought upon the novelties of Holborn or Piccadilly, he and Laura\ngained no idea of the metropolis, more distinct than that of the\nIrishman who complained he could not see London for the quantity of\nhouses. One only idea filled their hearts, and brightened their\ncountenances, while they looked at each other with a smile of delight,\nsaying, \"now, at last, we are going to see Frank!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE ARRIVAL.\n\n  What is life?----a varied tale,\n  Deeply moving, quickly told.\n\n                                        Willis.\n\n\n\"Oh! what a lovely cottage!\" exclaimed Laura, in an ecstacy of joy, when\nthey stopped before a beautiful house, with large airy windows down to\nthe ground; walls that seemed one brilliant mass of roses; rich flowery\nmeadows in front, and a bright smooth lawn behind, stretching down to\nthe broad bosom of the Thames, which reflected on its glassy surface\ninnumerable boats, filled with gay groups of merry people. \"That is such\na place as I have often dreamed of, but never saw before! It seems made\nfor perfect happiness!\"\n\n\"Yes! how delightful to live here with Frank and uncle David!\" added\nHarry. \"We shall be sailing on the water all day!\"\n\nThe cottage gate was now opened, and Major Graham himself appeared under\nthe porch; but instead of hurrying forward, as he always formerly did,\nto welcome them after the very shortest separation, he stood gravely and\nsilently at the door, without so much as raising his eyes from the\nground; and the paleness of his countenance filled both Harry and Laura\nwith astonishment. They flew to meet him, making an exclamation of joy;\nbut after embracing them affectionately, he did not utter a word, and\nled the way with hurried and agitated steps into a sitting room.\n\n\"Where is Frank?\" exclaimed Harry, looking eagerly round. \"Why is he not\nhere? Call him down! Tell him we are come!\"\n\nA long pause ensued; and Laura trembled when she looked at her uncle,\nwho was some moments before he could speak, and sat down taking each of\nthem by the hand, with such a look of sorrow and commiseration, that\nthey were filled with alarm.\n\n\"My dear Harry and Laura!\" said he solemnly, \"you have never known grief\ntill now, but if you love me, listen with composure. I have sad news to\ntell, yet it is of the very greatest consequence that you should bear up\nwith fortitude. Frank is extremely ill; and the joy he felt about your\ncoming, has agitated him so much, that he is worse than you can possibly\nconceive. It probably depends upon your conduct now, whether he survives\nthis night or not. Frank knows you are here; he is impatient for you to\nembrace him; he becomes more and more agitated every moment the meeting\nis delayed; yet if you give way to childish grief, or even to childish\njoy, upon seeing him again, the Doctors think it may cause his immediate\ndeath. You might hear his breathing in any part of this house. He is in\nthe lowest extreme of weakness! It will be a dreadful scene for you\nboth. Tell me, Harry and Laura, can you trust yourselves? Can you, for\nFrank's own sake, enter his room this moment, as quietly as if you had\nseen him yesterday, and speak to him with composure?\"\n\nLaura felt, on hearing these words, as if the very earth had opened\nunder her feet,--a choking sensation arose in her throat,--her colour\nfled,--her limbs shook,--her whole countenance became convulsed with\nanguish,--but making a resolute effort, she looked anxiously at Harry,\nand then said, in a low, almost inaudible voice,\n\n\"Uncle David! we are able,--God will strengthen us. I dare not think a\nmoment. The sooner it is done the better. Let us go now.\"\n\nMajor Graham slowly led the way without speaking, till they reach the\nbed-room door, where he paused for a moment, while Harry and Laura\nlistened to the gasping sound of Frank struggling for breath.\n\n\"Remember you will scarcely know him,\" whispered he, looking doubtfully\nat Laura's pallid countenance; \"but a single expression of emotion may\nbe fatal. Show your love for Frank now, my dear children. Spare him all\nagitation,--forget your own feelings for his sake.\"\n\nWhen Harry and Laura entered the room, Frank buried his face in his\nhands, and leaned them on the table, saying, in convulsive accents, \"Go\naway, Laura!--oh go away just now! I cannot bear it yet!--leave\nme!--leave me!\"\n\nIf Laura had been turned into marble at the moment, she could not have\nseemed more perfectly calm, for her mind was wound up to an almost\nsupernatural effort, and advancing to the place where he sat, without\nattempting to speak, she took Frank by the hand--Harry did the same; and\nnot a sound was heard for some moments, but the convulsive struggles of\nFrank himself, while he gasped for breath, and vainly tried to speak,\ntill at length he raised his head and fixed his eyes on Laura, who felt\nthen, for the first time, struck with the dreadful conviction, that this\nmeeting was but a prelude to their immediate and final separation. The\npale ashy cheek, the hollow eye, the sharp and altered features, all\ntold a tale of anguish such as she had never before conceived, and a\ncold tremor passed through her frame, as she stood amazed and bewildered\nwith grief, while the past, the present, and the future seemed all one\nmighty heap of agony. Still she gazed steadily on Frank, and said\nnothing, conscious that the smallest indulgence of emotion would bring\nforth a torrent which nothing could control, and determined, unless her\nheart ceased to beat, that he should see nothing to increase his\nagitation.\n\nAt length, in a low, faint, broken voice, Frank was able to speak, and\nlooking with affectionate sympathy at Laura, he said, \"Do not think,\ndear sister, that I always suffer as you see me now. This joy has been\ntoo much for me. I shall soon feel easier.\"\n\nMajor Graham observed a livid paleness come over Laura's countenance\nwhen she attempted to answer, and seeing it was impossible to sustain\nthe trial a moment longer, he made a pretext to hurry her away. Harry\ninstantly followed, and rushing into a vacant room, he threw himself\ndown in an agony of grief, and wept convulsively, till the very bed\nshook beneath him. Hours passed on, and Major Graham left them to\nexhaust their grief in weeping together, but every moment seemed only to\nincrease their agitation, as the conviction became more fearfully\ncertain that Frank was indeed lost to them for ever. This then was the\nmeeting they had so often, and so joyously anticipated! Laura sunk upon\nher knees beside Harry, and prayers were mingled with their tears, while\nthey asked for consolation, and tried to feel resigned. \"Alas!\" thought\nshe solemnly, \"how truly did grandmama say, 'If the sorrows of this\nworld are called 'light afflictions,' what must be those from which\nChrist died to save us!' It is merciful that we are not forbid to weep,\nfor, oh! who ever lost such a brother?--the kindest--the best of\nbrothers!--dear, dear Frank!--can nothing be done! Uncle David!\" added\nLaura, clinging to Major Graham, when he entered the room, \"oh! say\nsomething to us about Frank getting better,--do you think he will? May\nwe have a hope?--one single hope to live upon, that Frank may possibly\nbe spared; do not turn away--do not look so very sad--think how young\nFrank is,--and the Doctors are so skilful--and--and oh, uncle David! he\nis dying! I see it! I must believe it!\" continued she, wringing her\nhands with grief. \"You cannot give us one word of hope, though the whole\nworld would be nothing without him.\"\n\n\"My dear,--my very dear Laura! remember that consoling text in holy\nScripture, 'Be still, and know that I am God;'--we have no idea what He\ncan do in saving us from sorrow, or in comforting us when it comes,\ntherefore let us seek peace from Him, and believe that all shall indeed\nbe ordered well, even though our own hearts were to be broken with\naffliction. Frank has seen old nurse Crabtree, and is now in a\nrefreshing sleep, therefore I wish you to take the opportunity of\nsitting in his room, and accustoming yourselves, if possible, to the\nsight of his altered appearance. He is sometimes very cheerful, and\nalways patient, therefore we must keep up our own spirits, and try to\nassist him in bearing his sufferings, rather than increase them, by\nshowing what we feel ourselves. I was pleased with you both this\nmorning--that meeting was no common effort, and now we must show our\nsubmission to the Divine will, difficult as that may be, by a deep,\nheartfelt resignation to whatever He ordains.\"\n\nHarry and Laura still felt stupified with grief, but they mechanically\nfollowed Major Graham into Frank's room, and sat down in a distant\ncorner behind his chair, observing with awe and astonishment his pallid\ncountenance, his emaciated hands, and his drooping figure, while\nscarcely yet able to believe that this was indeed their own beloved\nFrank. After they had remained immoveably still for some time, though\nshedding many bitter tears, as they gazed on the wreck of one so very\ndear, he suddenly started awake, and glanced anxiously round the room,\nthen with a look of deep disappointment, he said to uncle David, in low,\nfeeble accents,\n\n\"It was only a dream! I have often dreamed the same thing, when far away\nat sea,--that would have been too much happiness! I fancied Harry and\nLaura were here!\"\n\n\"It was no dream, dear Frank! we are here,\" said Laura, trying to speak\nin a quiet, subdued voice.\n\n\"My dear sister! then all is well! but pray sit always where I can see\nyou. After wishing so long for our meeting, it appears nearly impossible\nthat we are together at last.\"\n\nFrank became exhausted with speaking so much, but pointed to a seat near\nhimself, where Harry and Laura sat down, after which he gazed at them\nlong and earnestly, with a look of affectionate pleasure, while his\nsmile, which had lost all its former cheerfulness, was now full of\ntenderness and sensibility. At length his countenance gradually changed,\nwhile large tears gathered in his eyes, and coursed each other silently\ndown his cheeks. Thoughts of the deepest sadness seemed passing through\nhis mind during some moments, but checking the heavy sigh that rose in\nhis breast, he riveted his hands together, and looked towards heaven\nwith an expression of placid submission, saying these words in a\nscarcely audible tone, though evidently addressed to those around,\n\n\"Weeping endureth for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" \"We know\nthat if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a\nbuilding of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\"\n\"Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; _but_ weep sore for him\nthat goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native\ncountry.\"[1]\n\n  [1] Jeremiah xxii. 10.\n\nThese words fell upon the ear of Harry and Laura like a knell of death,\nfor they now saw that Frank himself believed he was dying, and it\nappeared as if their last spark of hope expired when they heard this\nterrible dispensation announced from his own lips. He seemed anxious now\nthat they should understand his full meaning, and receive all the\nconsolation which his mind could afford, for he closed his eyes, and\nadded in solemn accents,\n\n\"I must have died at some time, and why not now? If I leave friends who\nare very dear on earth, I go to my chief best friend in heaven. The\nwhole peace and comfort of my mind rest on thinking of our Saviour's\nmerits. Let us all be ready to say, 'the will of the Lord be done.'\nThink often, Harry and Laura, of those words we so frequently repeated\nto grandmama formerly:\n\n  'Take comfort, Christians, when your friends\n    In Jesus fall asleep,\n  Their better being never ends,\n    Why then dejected weep?\n\n  Why inconsolable as those\n    To whom no hope is given?\n  Death is the messenger of peace,\n    And calls 'my' soul to Heaven.'\"\n\nFrank's voice failed, his head fell back upon the pillows, and he\nremained for a length of time, with his eyes closed in solemn meditation\nand prayer, while Laura and Harry, unable so much as to look at each\nother, leaned upon the table, and wept in silence.\n\nLaura felt as if she had grown old in a moment,--as if life could give\nno more joy--and as if she herself stood already on the verge of the\ngrave. It appeared like a dream that she had ever been happy, and a\ndreadful reality to which she was now awakened. \"Behold, God taketh\naway! who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?\"\n\"Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.\" These were texts\nwhich forced themselves on her mind, with mournful emphasis, while she\nfelt how helpless is earthly affection when the dispensations of God\nare upon us. All her love for Frank could not avert the stroke of\ndeath,--all his attachment to her must now be buried in the grave,--and\nthe very tenderness they felt for each other, only embittered the\nsorrows of this dreadful moment.\n\nFrom that day, Harry and Laura, according to the advice of uncle David,\ntestified their affection for Frank, not by tears and useless\nlamentations, though these were not always to be controlled in private,\nbut by the incessant, devoted attention with which they watched his\nlooks, anticipated his wishes, and thought every exertion a pleasure\nwhich could in the slightest degree contribute to his comfort. Frank, on\nhis part, spared their feelings, by often concealing what he suffered,\nand by speaking of his own death, as if it had been a journey on which\nhe must prepare with readiness to enter, reminding them, that never to\ndie, was never to be happy, as all they saw him endure from sickness,\nbecame nothing to what he endured from struggling against sin and\ntemptation, which were the great evils of existence,--and that from all\nthese he would be for ever freed by death. \"Those who are prepared for\nthe change,\" added he, solemnly, \"can neither live too long, nor die too\nsoon; for when God gives us His blessing, He then sends heaven, as it\nwere, into the soul before the soul ascends to heaven; and I trust to\nbeing gifted with faith and submission for all that may be ordained\nduring my few remaining hours upon earth.\"\n\nYet, with every desire to feel resigned, Frank himself was sometimes\nsurprised out of his usual fortitude, especially when thinking that he\nmust never more hope to see Lady Harriet, towards whom he cast many a\nlonging and affecting thought, saying once, with deep emotion, \"If I\ncould only see grandmama again, I should feel quite well!\" One evening,\nas he sat near an open window, gazing on the rich tints of twilight, and\nbreathing with more than usual ease, a wandering musician paused with\nher guitar, and sung several airs with great pathos and expression. At\nlength she played the tune of \"Home! sweet home,\" to which Frank\nlistened for some moments with intense agitation, till, clasping his\nhands and bursting into tears, he exclaimed, in accents of powerful\nemotion,\n\n\"Home! That happy home! Oh! never--never more,--_my_ home is in the\ngrave.\"\n\nLaura wept convulsively while he added in broken accents, \"I shall still\nbe remembered--still lamented--you must not love me too well,\nLaura,--not as I love you, or your sorrow would be too great; but long\nhence, when Harry and you are happy together, surrounded with friends,\nthink sometimes of one who must for ever be absent,--who loved you\nbetter than them all,--whose last prayer will be for you both. Oh! who\ncan tell what my feelings are! I can do nothing now but cause distress\nand anguish to those who love me best!\"\n\n\"Frank, I would not exchange your affection for the wealth of worlds. As\nlong as I live, it will be my greatest earthly happiness to have had\nsuch a brother; and if we are to suffer a sorrow that I cannot name, and\ndare not think of, you are teaching me how to bear it, and leaving us\nthe only comfort we can have, in knowing that you are happy.\"\n\n\"Many plans and many hopes I had for the future, Laura,\" added Frank;\n\"but there is no future to me now in this world. Perhaps I may escape a\nmultitude of sorrows, but how gladly would I have shared all yours, and\nensured my best happiness by uniting with Harry and you in living to\nGod. If you both learn more by my death than by my life, then, indeed, I\ndo rejoice. With respect to myself, it matters but little a few years or\nhours sooner, for I may say, in the words of Job, 'though He slay me,\nyet will I trust in Him.'\"\n\nFrank's sufferings increased every day, and became so very great at\nlast, that the Doctor proposed giving him strong doses of laudanum, to\nbring on a stupor and allay the pain; but when this was mentioned to\nhim, he said, \"I know it is my duty to take whatever you prescribe, and\nI certainly shall, but if we can do without opiates, let me entreat you\nto refrain from them. Often formerly at sea I used to think it very sad\nhow few of those I attended in sickness were allowed by the physician to\ndie in possession of their senses, on account of being made to take\nlaudanum, which gave them false spirits and temporary ease. Let me\nretain my faculties as long as they are mercifully granted to me. I can\nbear pain,--at least, God grant me strength to do so,--but I cannot\nwillingly enter the presence of my Creator in a state little short of\nintoxication.\"\n\nMany days of agony followed this resolution on the part of Frank, but\nthough the medicine, which would have brought some hours of oblivion,\nlay within reach, he persevered in wishing to preserve his\nconsciousness, whatever suffering it might cost; and though now and then\na prayer for bodily relief was wrung from him in his acute agony, the\nmost frequent and fervent supplications that he uttered night and day\nwere, in an accent of intense emotion, \"God have mercy upon my soul.\"\n\nHarry and Laura were surprised to find the fields and walks near London\nso very rural and beautiful as they appeared at Hammersmith, and to meet\nwith much more simplicity and kindness among the common people than they\nhad anticipated. The poorer neighbours, who became aware of their\naffliction, testified a degree of sympathy which frequently astonished\nthem, and was often afterwards remembered with pleasure, one instance of\nwhich seemed peculiarly touching to Laura. Frank always suffered most\nacutely during the night, and seldom closed his eyes in sleep till\nmorning, therefore she invariably remained with him, to beguile those\nweary hours, while any remonstrance on his part against so fatiguing a\nduty, became a mere waste of words, as she only grew sadder and paler,\nsaying, there would be time enough to take care of herself when she\ncould no longer be of use to him. The earliest thing that gave any\nrelief to Frank's cough every day, generally was, a tumbler of milk,\nwarm from the cow, which had been ordered for him, and was brought\nalmost as soon as the dawn of light. Once, when Frank had been unusually\nill, and sighed in restless agony till morning, Laura watched\nimpatiently for day, and when the milkman was seen, at six o'clock,\nslowly trudging through the fields, and advancing leisurely towards the\nhouse, Laura hurried eagerly down to meet him, exclaiming in accents of\njoy, while she held out the tumbler, \"Oh! I am so glad you are come at\nlast!\"\n\n\"At last, Miss!! I am as early as usual!\" replied he, gruffly. \"It's not\nmany poor folks that gets up so soon to their work, and if you had to\nlabour as hard as me all day, you would maybe think the morning came too\nsoon.\"\n\n\"I am seldom in bed all night,\" answered Laura, sadly. \"My poor sick\nbrother cannot rest till this milk is brought, and I wait with him, hour\nafter hour till daylight, wearying for you to come.\"\n\nThe old dairyman looked with sorrowful surprise at Laura, while she,\nthinking no more of what had passed, hurried away; but next morning,\nwhen sitting up again with Frank, she became surprised to observe the\nmilkman a whole hour earlier than usual, plodding along towards his\ncattle at a peculiarly rapid pace. He stayed not more than five minutes,\nonly milking one cow, though all the others gathered round him, and as\nsoon as he had filled his little pail, he came straight toward Major\nGraham's cottage, and knocked at the door. Laura instantly ran down to\nthank him with her whole heart for his kind attention, after which, as\nlong as Frank continued ill, the old dairyman rose long before his usual\ntime, to bring this welcome refreshment.\n\nFrank desired Laura to beg that he would not take so much trouble, or\nelse to insist on his accepting some remuneration, but the old man would\nneither discontinue the custom, nor receive any recompense.\n\n\"Let me see this kind good dairyman, to thank him myself,\" said Frank,\none night, when he felt rather easier; and next morning, Laura invited\npoor Teddy Collins to walk up stairs, who looked exceedingly astonished,\nthough very much pleased at the proposal, saying, \"May be, Ma'am, the\npoor young gentleman would not like to see a stranger like me!\"\n\n\"No one is a stranger who feels for him as you have done,\" replied\nLaura, leading the way, and Frank's countenance lighted up with a smile\nof pleasure when they entered his room. He held out his thin emaciated\nhand to Teddy, who looked earnestly and sorrowfully in his face as he\ngrasped hold of it, saying, \"You look very poorly, Sir! I'm afraid,\nindeed, you are sadly ill.\"\n\n\"That I am! as ill as any one can be on this side of eternity! My tale\nis told, my days are numbered; but I would not go out of this world\nwithout saying how grateful we both feel for your attention. As a cup of\ncold water given in Christian kindness shall hereafter be rewarded, I\ntrust also that your attention to me may not be forgotten.\"\n\n\"You are heartily welcome, Sir! It is a great honour for a poor old man\nlike me to oblige anybody. I shall not long be able for work now, seeing\nthat I am upwards of threescore and ten, and my days are already full of\nlabour and sorrow.\"\n\n\"To both of us, then, the night is far spent, and the day is at hand,\"\nreplied Frank--\"How strange it seems, that, old as you are. I am still\nolder; my feeble frame will be sooner worn out, and my body laid at rest\nin the grave! Let me hope that you have already applied your heart to\nwisdom, for every child of earth must, sooner or later, find how short\nis every thing but eternity. While I appear before you here as a\nspectacle of mortality, think how soon and how certainly you must\nfollow. May you then find, as I do, that even in the last extreme of\nsickness and sorrow, there is comfort in looking forward to such\nblessings as 'eye hath not seen, nor ear heard.' Farewell, my kind\nfriend! In this world we shall meet no more, but there is another and a\nbetter.\"\n\nThe old man, apparently unwilling to withdraw, paused for some moments\nafter Frank had ceased to speak. He muttered a few inaudible words in\nreply, and then slowly and sorrowfully left the room, while Frank's head\nsunk languidly on the pillows, and Laura retired to her room, where, as\nusual, she wept herself to sleep.\n\nWhen Harry and Laura first arrived at Hammersmith, Frank felt anxious\nthat they should walk out every day for the benefit of their health; but\nfinding that each made frequent excuses for remaining constantly with\nhim at home, he invented a plan which induced them to take exercise\nregularly.\n\nBeing early in June, strawberries were yet so exceedingly rare, that\nthey could scarcely be had for any money; but the Doctor had allowed his\npatient to eat fruit. Frank asked his two young attendants to wander\nabout in quest of gardens where a few strawberries could be got, and to\nbring him some. Accordingly, they set out one morning; and after a long,\nunsuccessful search, at last observed a small green-house near the road,\nwith one little basket in the window, scarcely larger than a thimble,\ncontaining two or three delicious King seedlings, perfectly ripe. These\nwere to be sold for five shillings; but hardly waiting to ascertain the\nprice, Laura seized this welcome prize with delight, and paid for it on\nthe spot. Every morning afterwards, her regular walk was to hasten with\nHarry towards this pretty little shop, where they talked to the gardener\nabout poor Frank being so very ill, and told him that this fine fruit\nwas wanted for their sick brother at home.\n\nOne day the invalid seemed so much worse than usual, that neither Harry\nnor Laura could bear to leave him a moment; so they requested Mrs.\nCrabtree to fetch the strawberries, which she readily agreed to do; but\non drawing out her purse in the shop, and saying that she came to buy\nthat little basket of fruit at the window, what was her astonishment\nwhen the gardener looked civil and sorry, answering that he would not\nsell those strawberries if she offered him a guinea a-piece.\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, getting into a rage; \"then what do you\nput them up at the window for? There is no use pretending to keep a\nshop, if you will not sell what is in it! Give me these strawberries\nthis minute, and here's your five shillings!\"\n\n\"It's quite impossible,\" replied the gardener, holding back the basket.\n\"You see, ma'am, every day last week a little Master and Miss came to\nthis here shop, buying my strawberries for a young gentleman who is very\nill; and they look both so sweet and so mournful-like, that I would not\ndisappoint them for all the world. They seem later to-day than usual,\nand are, may be, not coming at all; but if I lose my day's profits, it\ncan't be helped. They shall not walk here for nothing, if they please to\ncome!\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Crabtree explained that she belonged to the same family as\nHarry and Laura, the gardener looked hard at her to see if she were\nattempting to deceive him; but feeling convinced that she spoke the\ntruth, he begged her to carry off the basket to his young friends,\npositively refusing to take the price.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. THE LAST BIRTH-DAY.\n\n  Mere human power shall fast decay,\n  And youthful vigour cease;\n  But they who wait upon the Lord,\n  In strength shall still increase.\n\n\nFrank felt no unnatural apathy or indifference about dying, for he\nlooked upon it with awe, though not with fear; nor did he express any\nrapturous excitement on the solemn occasion, knowing that death is an\nappointed penalty for transgression, which, though deprived of its\nsharpest sting by the triumphs of the cross, yet awfully testifies to\nall succeeding generations, that each living man has individually\nmerited the utmost wrath of God, and that the last moment on earth, of\neven the most devoted Christian, must be darkened by the gloom of our\noriginal sin and natural corruption. Yet, \"as in Adam all die, so in\nChrist are all made alive;\" and amidst the throng of consolatory and\naffecting meditations that crowded into his mind on the great subject of\nour salvation, he kept a little book in which were carefully recorded\nsuch texts and reflections as he considered likely to strengthen his own\nfaith, and to comfort those he left behind--saying one day to Major\nGraham,\n\n\"Tell grandmama, that though my days have been few upon the earth, they\nwere happy! When you think of me, uncle David, after my sufferings are\nover, it may well be a pleasing remembrance, that you were always the\nbest, the kindest of friends. Oh! how kind! but I must not--cannot speak\nof that----. This is my birth-day!--my last birth-day! Many a joyous one\nwe kept together, but those merry days are over, and these sadder ones\ntoo shall cease; yet the time is fast approaching, so welcome to us\nboth,\n\n  'When death-divided friends at last\n  Shall meet to part no more.'\"\n\nIn the evening, Major Graham observed that Frank made Mrs. Crabtree\nbring everything belonging to him, and lay it on the table, when he\nemployed himself busily in tying up a number of little parcels,\nremarking, with a languid smile,\n\n\"My possessions are not valuable, but these are for some old friends and\nmessmates, who will be pleased to receive a trifling memorial of one who\nloved them. Send my dirk to Peter Grey, who is much reformed now. Here\nare all the letters any of you ever sent me; how very often they have\nbeen read! but now, even that intercourse must end; keep them, for they\nwere the dearest treasures I possessed. At Madras, formerly, I remember\nhearing of a nabob who was bringing his whole fortune home in a chest of\ngold, but the ropes for hoisting his treasure on board were so\ninsufficient, that the whole gave way, and it fell into the ocean, never\nto be recovered. That seemed a very sudden termination of his hopes and\nplans, but scarcely more unexpected than my own. 'We are a wind that\npasseth away and cometh not again.' Many restless nights are ordained\nfor me now, probably that I may find no resource but prayer and\nmeditation. Others can afford time to slumber, but I so soon shall sleep\nthe sleep of death, that it becomes a blessing to have such hours of\nsolitary thought, for preparing my heart and establishing my faith,\nduring this moment of need.\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank! but your prayers are not solitary, for ours are joined to\nyours,\" added Laura. \"I read in an old author lately, that Christian\nfriends in this world might be compared to travellers going along the\nsame road in separate carriages--sometimes they are together--often they\nare apart--sometimes they can exchange assistance, as we do now--and\noften they jostle against each other, till at last, having reached the\njourney's end, they are removed out of these earthly vehicles into a\nbetter state, where they shall look back upon former circumstances, and\nknow even as they are known.\"\n\nLaura was often astonished to observe the change which had taken place\nin her own character and feelings within the very short period of their\ndistress. Her extreme terror of a thunder-storm formerly, had occasioned\nmany a jest to her brothers, when Harry used, occasionally, to roll\nheavy weights in the room above her own, to imitate the loudest peals,\nwhile Frank sometimes endeavoured to argue her out of that excessive\napprehension with which she listened to the most distant surmise of a\nstorm. Now, however, at Hammersmith, long after midnight, the moon, on\none occasion, became completely obscured by dense heavy clouds, and the\nair felt so oppressively hot, that Frank, who seemed unusually\nbreathless, drew closer to the window. Laura supported his head, and was\ndeeply occupied in talking to him, when suddenly a broad flash of\nlightning glared into the room, followed by a crash of thunder, that\nseemed to crack the very heavens. Again and again the lightning gleamed\nin her face with such vividness, that Laura fancied she could\ndistinguish the heat of it, and yet she stirred not, nor did a single\nexclamation, as in former days, arise on her lips.\n\n\"Pray shut the window, Laura,\" said Frank languidly, raising his eyes;\n\"and be so kind as to close the shutters!\"\n\n\"Why, Frank?--you never used to be alarmed by thunder!\"\n\n\"No! nor am I now, dear Laura. What danger need a dying person fear?\nSome few hours sooner or later would be of little consequence--\n\n    Come he slow, or come he fast,\n    It is but death that comes at last.\n\nYet, Laura, do you think I have forgotten old times! Oh, no!--not while\nI live. You attend to my feelings, and surely it is my duty to remember\nyours.\"\n\n\"Never mind me, Frank!\" whispered Laura. \"I have got over all that\nfolly. When real fears and sorrows come, we care no more about those\nthat were imaginary.\"\n\n\"True, my dear sister; and there is no courage or fortitude like that\nderived from faith in a superintending providence. Though all creation\nreel, we may sleep in peace, for to Christians 'danger is safe, and\ntumult calm.'\"\n\nWhen Frank grew worse, he became often delirious. Yet as in health he\nhad been habitually cheerful, his mind generally wandered to agreeable\nsubjects. He fancied himself walking on the bright meadows, and picking\nflowers by the river side,--meeting Lady Harriet,--and even speaking to\nhis father, as if Sir Edward had been present; while Harry and Laura\nlistened, weeping and trembling, to behold the wreck of such a mind and\nheart as his. One evening, he seemed unusually well, and requested that\nhis arm-chair might be wheeled to the open window, where he gazed with\ndelight at the hills and meadows,--the clouds and glittering water,--the\ncattle standing in the stream,--the boats reflected on its surface,--and\nthe roses fluttering at every casement.\n\n\"Those joyous little birds!--their song makes me cheerful,\" said he, in\na tone of placid enjoyment. \"I have been in countries where the birds\nnever sing, and the leaves never fade; but they excited no sympathy or\ninterest. Here we have notes of gladness both in sunshine and storm,\nteaching us a lesson of grateful contentment,--while those drooping\nroses preach a sermon to me, for as easily might they recover freshness\nand bloom as myself. We shall both lie low before long in the dust, yet\na spring shall come hereafter to revive even 'the ashes of the urn.'\nThen, uncle David, we meet again,--not as now, amidst sorrow and\nsuffering, with death and separation before us,--but blessed by the\nconsciousness that our sins are forgiven,--our trials all ended,--and\nthat our afflictions which were but for a moment, have worked out for us\na far more exceeding, even an eternal weight of glory.\"\n\nSome hours afterwards the Doctor entered. After receiving a cordial\nwelcome from Frank, and feeling his pulse, he instantly examined his\narms and neck, which were covered entirely over with small red spots,\nupon observing which, the friendly physician suddenly changed\ncountenance, and stole an alarmed glance at Major Graham.\n\n\"I feel easier and better to-day, Doctor, than at any time since my\nillness,\" said Frank, looking earnestly in his face. \"Do you think this\neruption will do me good? Life has much that would be dear to me, while\nI have friends like these to live for. Can it be possible that I may yet\nrecover?\"\n\nThe Doctor turned away, unable to reply, while Frank intensely watched\nhis countenance, and then gazed at the pale agitated face of Major\nGraham. Gradually the hope which had brightened in his cheek began to\nfade,--the lustre of his eye became dim,--his countenance settled into\nan expression of mournful resignation,--and covering his face with his\nhands, he said, in a voice of deep emotion,\n\n\"I see how it is!--God's will be done!\"\n\nThe silence of death succeeded, while Frank laid his head on the pillow\nand closed his eyes. A few natural tears coursed each other slowly down\nhis cheek; but at length, an hour or two afterwards, being completely\nexhausted, he fell into a gentle sleep, from which the Doctor considered\nit very doubtful if he would ever awaken, as the red spots indicated\nmortification, which must inevitably terminate his life before next day.\n\nLaura retired to the window, making a strenuous effort to restrain her\nfeelings, that she might be enabled to witness the last awful scene; and\nfervently did she pray for such strength to sustain it with fortitude,\nas might still render her of some use to her dying brother. Her pale\ncountenance might almost have been mistaken for that of a corpse, but\nfor the expression of living agony in her eye; and she was sunk in deep,\nsolemn thought, when her attention became suddenly roused by observing a\nchariot and four drive furiously up to the gate, while the horses were\nfoaming and panting as they stopped. A tall gentleman, of exceedingly\nstriking appearance, sprung hurriedly out, walked rapidly towards the\ncottage door, and in another minute entered Frank's room, with the\nanimated look of one who expected to be gladly welcomed, and to occasion\nan agreeable surprise.\n\nHarry and Laura shrunk close to their uncle, when the stranger, now in\nevident agitation, gazed round the room with an air of painful\nastonishment, till Major Graham looked round, and instantly started up\nwith an exclamation of amazement, \"Edward! is it possible! This is\nindeed a consolation! you are still in time!\"\n\n\"In time!!\" exclaimed Sir Edward, grasping his brother's hand with\nvehement agitation. \"Do you mean to say that Frank is yet in danger!\"\n\nMajor Graham mournfully shook his head, and undrawing the bed curtains,\nhe silently pointed to the sleeping countenance of Frank, which was as\nstill as death, and already overspread by a ghastly paleness. Sir Edward\nthen sunk into a chair, and clenched his hands over his forehead with a\nlook of unspeakable anguish, saying, in an under-tone, \"Worn out, as I\nam, in mind and body, I needed not this to destroy me! Say at once,\nbrother, is there any hope?\"\n\n\"None, my dear Edward! None! Even now he is insensible, and I fear with\nlittle prospect of ever becoming conscious again.\"\n\nAt this moment Frank opened his eyes, which were dim and glassy, while\nit became evident that he had relapsed into a state of temporary\ndelirium.\n\n\"Get more candles! how very dark it is!\" he said. \"Who are all those\npeople? Send away everybody but grandmama! I must speak to her alone.\nNever tell papa of all this, it would only distress him--say nothing\nabout me. Why do Harry and Laura never come? They have been absent more\nthan a week! Who took away uncle David too?\"\n\nLaura listened for some time in an agony of grief, till at last, unable\nany longer to restrain her feelings, she clasped Frank in her arms and\nburst into tears, exclaiming, in accents of piercing distress, \"Oh\nFrank! dear Frank! have you forgotten poor Laura?\"\n\n\"Not till I am dead!\" whispered he, while a momentary gleam of\nrecollection lighted up his face. \"Laura! we meet again.\"\n\nSir Edward now wished to speak, but Frank had relapsed into a state of\nfeeble unconsciousness, from which nothing could arouse him; once or\ntwice he repeated the name of Laura in a low melancholy voice, till it\nbecame totally inaudible--his breath became shorter--his lips became\nlivid--his whole frame seemed convulsed--and some hours afterwards, all\nthat was mortal of Frank Graham ceased to exist. About four in the\nmorning his body was at rest, and his spirit returned to God who gave\nit.\n\nThe candles had burned low in their sockets, and still the mourners\nremained, unwilling to move from the awful scene of their bereavement.\nMrs. Crabtree at length, who laid out the body herself, extinguished the\nlights, and flung open the window curtains. Then suddenly a bright blaze\nof sunshine streamed into the room, and rested on the cold pale face of\nthe dead. To the stunned and bewildered senses of Harry and Laura, the\nbrilliant dawn of morning seemed like a mockery of their distress. Many\npersons were already passing by--the busy stir of life had begun, and a\nboy strolling along the road whistled his merry tune as he went gaily\non.\n\n\"We are indeed mere atoms in the world!\" thought Laura bitterly, while\nthese sights and sounds fell heavily on her heart. \"If Harry and I had\nboth been dead also, the sun would have shone as brightly, the birds\nsung as joyfully, and those people been all as gay and happy as ever!\nNobody is thinking of Frank--nobody knows our misery--the world is going\non as if nothing had happened, and we are breaking our hearts with\ngrief!\"\n\nLaura's heart became stilled as she gazed on the peaceful and almost\nhappy expression of those beautiful features, which had now lost all\nappearance of suffering. The eyes, from which nothing but kindness and\nlove had beamed upon her, were now closed for ever; the lips which had\nspoken only words of generous affection and pious hope, were silent; and\nthe heart which had beat with every warm and brotherly feeling, was for\nthe first time insensible to her sorrows; yet Laura did not give way to\nthe strong excess of her grief, for it sunk upon her spirit with a\nleaden weight of anguish, which tears and lamentations could not\nexpress, and could not even relieve. She rose and kissed, for the last\ntime, that beloved countenance, which she was never to look upon again\ntill they met in heaven, and stole away to the silence and solitude of\nher own room, where Laura tried in vain to collect her thoughts. All\nseemed a dreary blank. She did not sigh--she could not weep; but she sat\nin dark and vacant abstraction, with one only consciousness filling her\nmind--the bitter remembrance that Frank was dead--that she could be of\nno farther use to him--that she could have no future intercourse with\nhim--that even in her prayers she could no longer have the comfort of\nnaming him; and when at last she turned to his own Bible which he had\ngiven her, to seek for consolation, her eyes refused their office, and\nthe pages became blistered with tears.\n\nAfter Frank's funeral, Sir Edward became too ill to leave his bed; and\nMajor Graham remained with him in constant conversation; while Harry and\nLaura did every thing to testify their affection, and to fill the place\nnow so sadly vacant.\n\nOn the following Sunday, several of the congregation at Hammersmith\nobserved two young strangers in the rector's pew, dressed in the deepest\nmourning, with pale and downcast countenances, who glided early into\nchurch, and sat immoveably still, side by side, while Mr. Palmer gave\nout for his text the affecting and appropriate words which Frank himself\nhad often repeated during his last illness, \"In an hour that ye think\nnot, the Son of man cometh.\"\n\nNot a tear was shed by either Harry or Laura,--their grief was too great\nfor utterance; yet they listened with breathless interest to the sermon,\nintended not only to console them, but also to instruct other young\npersons, from the afflicting event of Frank's death.\n\nMr. Palmer took this opportunity to describe all the amiable\ndispositions of youth, and to show how much of what is pleasing may\nappear before religion has yet taken entire possession of the mind; but\nhe painted in glowing colours the beautiful consistency and harmony of\ncharacter which must ensue after that happy change, when the Holy Spirit\nrenews the heart and influences the life. It almost seemed to Harry and\nLaura as if Frank were visibly before their eyes, when Mr. Palmer spoke\nin eloquent terms of that humility which no praise could diminish--that\nbenevolence which attended to the feelings, as well as the wants of\nothers,--that affection which was ever ready to make any sacrifice for\nthose he loved,--that docility which obeyed the call of duty on every\noccasion,--that meekness in the midst of provocation which could not be\nirritated,--that gentle firmness in maintaining the truths of the\ngospel, which no opposition could intimidate,--that cheerful submission\nto suffering which saw a hand of mercy in the darkest hour,--and that\nfaith which was ever \"forgetting those things which are behind, and\nreaching forth unto those things which are before,--pressing toward the\nmark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\"\n\nIt seemed as if years had passed over the heads of Harry and Laura\nduring the short period of their absence from home--that home where\nFrank had so anxiously desired to go! All was changed within and around\nthem,--sorrow had filled their hearts, and no longer merry, thoughtless\ncreatures, believing the world one scene of frolicsome enjoyment and\ncareless ease; they had now witnessed its realities,--they had felt its\ntrials,--they had experienced the importance of religion,--they had\nlearned the frailty of all earthly joy,--and they had received, amidst\ntears and sorrows, the last injunction of a dying brother, to \"call upon\nthe Lord while He is near, and to seek Him while he may yet be found.\"\n\n\"Uncle David,\" said Laura one day, several months after their return\nhome, \"Mrs. Crabtree first endeavoured to lead us aright by\nseverity,--you and grandmama then tried what kindness could do, but\nnothing was effectual till now, when God Himself has laid His hand upon\nus. Oh! what a heavy stroke was necessary to bring me to my right mind,\nbut now, while we weep many bitter tears, Harry and I often pray\ntogether that good may come out of evil, and that 'we who mourn so\ndeeply, may find our best, our only comfort from above'.\"\n\n  Unthinking, idle, wild, and young,\n  I laugh'd, and talk'd, and danc'd, and sung;\n  And proud of health, of frolic vain,\n  Dream'd not of sorrow, care, or pain,\n  Concluding in those hours of glee,\n  That all the world was made for me.\n\n  But when the days of trial came,\n  When sorrow shook this trembling frame,\n  When folly's gay pursuits were o'er,\n  And I could dance or sing no more;\n  It then occurr'd how sad 'twould be\n  Were this world only made for me.\n\n                                        Princess Amelia.\n\n\nTHE END.\n",
