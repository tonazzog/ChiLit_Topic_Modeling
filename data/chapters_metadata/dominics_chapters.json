  "content": "The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's\nTalbot Baines Reed\n\nPREFACE.\n\n_The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's_ is a story of public-school life,\nand was written for the _Boy's Own Paper_, in the Fourth Volume of which\nit appeared.  The numbers containing it are now either entirely out of\nprint or difficult to obtain; and many and urgent have been the\nrequests--from boys themselves, as well as from parents, head masters,\nand others--for its re-issue as a book.\n\nOf the story itself little need be said.  It deals in a bright and\nvigorous style with the kaleidoscopic, throbbing life of a great public\nschool--that world in miniature which, in its daily opportunities and\ntemptations, ambitions and failures, has so often afforded superabundant\nmaterial for narratives powerful to enchain the attention and sway the\nemotions, whether to smiles or tears.  This will take its place, amongst\nthe best of them.\n\nThough the story is one of school life, its interest is by no means\nlimited to school or college walls.  Boys of all sorts and conditions--\nay, and their parents too--will follow its fortunes with unflagging zest\nfrom the first page to the last; and it is difficult to conceive of any\nreader, be he young or old, who would not be the better for its vivid\nportraiture and bracing atmosphere.  There is a breeziness about it\ncalculated to stir the better life in the most sluggish; and without\npretence or affectation it rings out its warnings, no less than its\nnotes of cheer, clear and rousing as trumpet blasts.\n\n  \"Do right, and thou hast nought to fear,\n  Right hath a power that makes thee strong;\n  The night is dark, but light is near,\n  The grief is short, the joy is long.\"\n\nWithout the most distant approach to that fatal kind of sermonising\nwhich all but inevitably repels those whom it is meant to benefit, the\nstory forcefully illustrates how rapidly they may sink who once tamper,\nfor seeming present advantage, with truth, and how surely, sooner or\nlater, a noble character comes to vindication and honour; and in all\nsuch respects it is eminently true to life.  These boys of Saint\nDominic's, even the best of them, are very human--neither angels nor\nmonstrosities, but, for the most part, ardent, impulsive, out-and-out,\nwork-a-day lads; with the faults and failings of inexperience and\nimpetuosity, no doubt, but also with that moral grit and downright\nhonesty of purpose that are still, we believe, the distinguishing mark\nof the true British public-school boy.  Hence one is impelled to take\nfrom the outset a most genuine interest in them and their affairs, and\nto feel quite as though one had known many of them personally for years,\nand been distinctly the better, too, for that knowledge.  Such boys\nstand at the antipodes alike of the unreal abstractions of an effeminate\nsentimentalism--the paragons who prate platitudes and die young--and of\nthe morbid specimens of youthful infamy only too frequently paraded by\nthe equally unreal sensationalism of to-day to meet the cravings of a\nvitiated taste.\n\n_The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's_ is the kind of book we should place\nwith confidence in the hands of our own boys when leaving the home\nshelter, whether for school or the sterner after-battle; and we cannot\nconceive of the parent who, having read it with care and pleasure, as we\nhave done, and knowing at the same time anything of the stress and\nstrain of daily life, would not, with gratitude to the author, gladly do\nthe same.  With all their faults, Oliver Greenfield and Wraysford are\nsplendid boys, of just the fibre that the Church needs, and the world\ncannot afford to do without; and yet their school career proves by no\nmeans a bed of roses.  To drift with the current is proverbially easy;\nto seek to stem it manfully, and steer by the stars, may, and often\ndoes, lay one open to misapprehension or envy, and all the ills that\nfollow in their train; yet--\n\n  \"God is God, and right is right,\n  And truth the day must win;\n  To doubt would be disloyalty,\n  To falter would be sin.\"\n\nOur heroes had their full share of trouble--what real hero has not?--but\nthey come out of the ordeal purified and strengthened, with nobler\naspirations after duty, and tenderer thoughts of helpfulness towards\nthose needing, if far from seeking, their succouring arm.\n\nHow all this comes about it is not for us to tell.  Readers will find\nthat out for themselves, and thank us for allowing them, unaided, to do\nso.  The school cricket match, the grand football struggle, the\never-memorable prize-day--these are matters that no alien pen may touch.\nOur prayer is that God may abundantly bless the book to the building up\nin our schools and families of strong Christian characters, who in the\nafter days shall do valiant service for Christ and humanity.\n\nG.A. Hutchison.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE NOTICE BOARD.\n\nThe four o'clock bell was sounding up the staircase and down the\npassages of Saint Dominic's school.  It was a minute behind its time,\nand had old Roach, the school janitor, guessed at half the abuse\nprivately aimed at his devoted head for this piece of negligence, he\nmight have pulled the rope with a good deal more vivacity than he at\npresent displayed.\n\nAt the signal there was a general shuffling of feet and uproar of\nvoices--twelve doors swung open almost simultaneously, and next moment\nfive hundred boys poured out, flooding the staircases and passages,\nshouting, scuffling, and laughing, and throwing off by one easy effort\nthe restraint and gravity of the last six hours.\n\nThe usual rush and scramble ensued.  Some boys, taking off their coats\nand tucking up their sleeves as they ran, made headlong for the\nplayground.  Some, with books under their arms, scuttled off to their\nstudies.  The heroes of the Sixth stalked majestically to their\nquarters.  The day boarders hurried away to catch the train at Maltby.\nA few slunk sulkily to answer to their names in the detention-room, and\nothers, with the air of men to whom time is no object and exertion no\ntemptation, lounged about in the corridors with hands in pockets,\nregarding listlessly the general stampede of their fellows, and\napparently not knowing exactly what to do with themselves.\n\nAmong these last happened to be Bullinger of the Fifth and his\nparticular friend Ricketts, who, neither of them having any more\ntempting occupation, were comfortably leaning up against the door of the\nFourth junior class-room, thereby making prisoners of some twenty or\nthirty youngsters, whose infuriated yells and howls from within appeared\nto afford the two gentlemen a certain languid satisfaction.\n\n\"Open the door! do you hear?\" shrieked one little treble voice.\n\n\"All right!\" piped another.  \"I know who you are, you cads.  See if I\ndon't tell Dr Senior!\"\n\n\"Oh, please, I say, I shall lose my train!\" whimpered a third.\n\n\"Wait till I get out; see if I don't kick your shins!\" howled a fourth.\n\nIt was no use.  In vain these bantams stormed and raved, and entreated\nand blubbered.  The handle would not turn, and the door would not yield.\nMr Bullinger and his friend vouchsafed no reply, either to their\nthreats or their supplications, and how long the blockade might have\nlasted it is impossible to say, had not a fresh dissension called the\nbeleaguerers away.  A cluster of boys at a corner of the big corridor\nnear the main entrance attracted their curiosity, and suggested a\npossibility of even more entertainment than the goading into fury of a\nparcel of little boys, so, taking advantage of a moment when the\nbesieged had combined, shoulder to shoulder, to make one magnificent and\ndesperate onslaught on to the obdurate door, they quietly \"raised the\nsiege,\" and quitting their hold, left the phalanx of small heroes to\ntopple head over heels and one over another on to the stone floor of the\npassage, while they sauntered off arm-in-arm to the scene of the new\nexcitement.\n\nThe object which had attracted the knot of boys whom they now joined was\nthe School Notice Board, on which, from time to time, were posted\nnotices of general and particular interest to the school.  On this\nparticular afternoon (the first Friday of the Summer term) it was, as\nusual, crowded with announcements, each interesting in its way.\n\nThe first was in the handwriting of Dr Senior's secretary, and ran as\nfollows:--\n\n\"A Nightingale Scholarship, value 50 pounds a year for three years, will\nfall vacant at Michaelmas.  Boys under seventeen are eligible.\nParticulars and subject of examination can be had any evening next week\nin the secretary's room.\"\n\n\"Fifty-pounds a year _for_ three years!\" exclaimed a small boy, with a\nhalf whistle.  \"I wouldn't mind getting that!\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you, you avaricious young Jew?  You're under seventeen,\nI suppose?\" retorted the amiable Mr Bullinger, thereby raising a laugh\nat the expense of this little boy of eleven, who retired from the scene\nextinguished.\n\nThe next notice was in the classical handwriting of the secretary of the\nSixth Form Literary Society, and ran as follows:--\n\n\"This Society will meet on Tuesday.  Subject for debate, `That the\npresent age is degenerate,' moved by A.E. Callander, opposed by T.\nWinter.  Boys from the Senior Fifth are invited as auditors.\"\n\nThis notice, even with the patronising postscript, would have passed\nwithout comment, as Sixth Form notices usually did, had not some\naudacious hand ventured to alter a word and make the subject of debate,\ninstead of \"That the present age is degenerate,\" read \"That the present\nSixth is degenerate.\"  Who the perpetrator of this outrage might be was\na mystery, but the alteration was quite enough to render the notice very\namusing to many of the readers, especially the Fifth Form boys, and very\nterrible to others, especially the small boys, who looked nervous and\nguilty, and did not dare by the slightest sign to join in the mirth of\ntheir irreverent seniors.  Most of the assembly agreed that \"there would\nbe a row about it,\" with which assurance they passed on to the next\nnotice.\n\n\"Wanted, a Smart Fag.  No Tadpoles or Guinea-pigs need apply.  Horace\nWraysford, Fifth Form.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Horatius!\" said Ricketts.  \"A lucky young cub it will be that he\ntakes on,\" added he, turning to a group of the small boys near.  \"He'll\ndo your sums and look over your exercises for you like one o'clock.\nUgh! though, I suppose every man Jack of you is a Tadpole or a Pig?\"\n\nTadpoles and Guinea-pigs, I should say, were the names given to two\ncombinations or clubs in the clannish Junior School, the mysteries of\nwhich were known only to their members, but which were not regarded with\nfavour by the older boys.\n\nAs no one answered this charge, Ricketts indulged in a few general\nthreats, and a few not very complimentary comments on the clubs in\nquestion, and then returned to the notice board, which contained two\nmore announcements.\n\n\"Cricket Notices.  To-morrow will be a final big practice, when the\nelevens for the `A to M _versus_ N to Z' match on the 25th will be\nchosen.  `Sixth _versus_ School' will be played on the 1st proxo.  The\nSchool Eleven will be selected from among players in the two above\nmatches.\"\n\n\"A private meeting of the Fifth will be held this afternoon at 4.30 to\ndiscuss an important matter.\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Bullinger, looking up at the clock, \"it's half-past now!\nCome along, Rick.\"\n\nAnd the two demagogues disappeared arm-in-arm down the passage, followed\nby the admiring glances of the juniors, who spent the next half-hour in\nwondering what could be the important matter under consideration at the\nprivate meeting of the Fifth.  The universal conclusion was that it had\nreference to the suppression of the Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs--a\nproceeding the very suggestion of which made those small animals tremble\nwith mingled rage and fear, and sent them off wriggling to their own\nquarters, there to deliberate on the means of defence necessary to\nprotect themselves from the common enemy.\n\nThe meeting in the Fifth, however, was to consider a far more important\nsubject than the rebellious clubs of the Junior School.\n\nThe reader will doubtless have inferred, from what has already been\nsaid, that the young gentlemen of the Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's\nentertained, among other emotions, a sentiment something like jealousy\nof their seniors and superiors in the sixth.  Perhaps Saint Dominic's is\nnot the only school in which such a feeling has existed; but, at any\nrate during the particular period to which I am referring, it was pretty\nstrong there.  Not that the two Forms were at war, or that there was any\nfear of actual hostilities.  It was not so bad as all that.  But the\nFifth were too near the heroes of the top Form to consent to submit to\ntheir authority.  They would be Sixth men themselves soon, and then of\ncourse they would expect the whole school to reverence them.  But till\nthat time they resented the idea of bowing before these future comrades;\nand not only that, they took every opportunity of asserting their\nauthority among the juniors, and claiming the allegiance for themselves\nthey refused to render to others.  And they succeeded in this very well,\nfor they took pains to make themselves popular in the school, and to\nappear as the champions quite as much as the bullies of the small fry.\nThe consequence was that while Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs quaked and\nblushed in the presence of the majestic Sixth, they quaked and smirked\nin the presence of the Fifth, and took their thrashings meekly, in the\nhope of getting a Latin exercise looked over or a minor tyrant punished\nlater on.\n\nJust at the present time, too, the Fifth was made up of a set of fellows\nwell able to maintain the peculiar traditions of their fellowship.  They\nnumbered one or two of the cleverest boys (for their age) in Saint\nDominic's; and, more important still in the estimation of many, they\nnumbered not a few of the best cricketers, boxers, football-players, and\nrunners in the school.  With these advantages their popularity as a body\nwas very great--and it is only due to them to say that they bore their\nhonours magnanimously, and distributed their kicks and favours with the\nstrictest impartiality.\n\nSuch was the company which assembled on this afternoon in their own\nclass-room, with closed doors, to deliberate on \"private and important\nbusiness.\"  About twenty boys were present, and the reader must let me\nintroduce a few of them, before his curiosity as to the occasion of\ntheir assembling themselves together can be satisfied.\n\nThat handsome, jovial-looking boy of sixteen who is sitting there\nastride of a chair, in the middle of the floor, biting the end of a\nquill pen, is the redoubtable Horace Wraysford, the gentleman, it will\nbe remembered, who is in want of a fag.  Wraysford is one of the best\n\"all-round men\" in the Fifth, or indeed in the school.  He is certain to\nbe in the School Eleven against the County, certain to win the mile race\nand the \"hurdles\" at the Athletic Sports, and is not at all unlikely to\ncarry off the Nightingale Scholarship next autumn, even though one of\nthe Sixth is in for it too.  Indeed, it is said he would be quite\ncertain of this honour, were it not that his friend and rival Oliver\nGreenfield, who is standing there against the wall, with his head\nresting on a map of Greece, is also in for it.  Greenfield does not\nstrike one as nearly so brilliant a fellow as his friend.  He is quieter\nand more lazy, and more solemn.  Some say he has a temper, and others\nthat he is selfish; and generally he is not the most popular boy in\nSaint Dominic's.  Wraysford, however, sticks to him through thick and\nthin, and declares that, so far from being ill-tempered and selfish, he\nis one of the best fellows in the school, and one of the cleverest.  And\nMr Wraysford is prepared to maintain his allegation at the point of\nthe--knuckle!  That hulking, ugly youth is Braddy, the bully, the terror\nof the Guinea-pigs, and the laughing-stock of his own class-mates.  The\nboy who is fastening a chalk duster on to the collar of Braddy's coat is\nTom Senior, the Doctor's eldest son, who, one would have imagined, might\nhave learned better manners.  Last, not least (for we need not\nre-introduce Messrs. Ricketts or Bullinger, or go out of our way to\npresent Simon, the donkey of the Form, to the reader), is Master Anthony\nPembury, the boy now mounting up onto a chair with the aid of two\nfriends.  Anthony is lame, and one of the most dreaded boys in Saint\nDominic's.  His father is editor of the _Great Britain_, and the son\nseems to have inherited his talent for saying sharp things.  Woe betide\nthe Dominican who raises Tony's dander!  He cannot box, he cannot\npursue; but he can _talk_, and he can ridicule, as his victims all the\nschool over know.\n\nHe it is who has, of his own sweet will, summoned together the present\nmeeting, and the business he is now about to explain.\n\n\"The fact is, you fellows,\" he begins, \"I wanted to ask your opinion\nabout a little idea of my own.  You know the _Sixth Form Magazine_?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" says Ricketts; \"awful rubbish too!  Papers a mile long in it\nabout Greek roots; and poetry about the death of Seneca, and all that\nsort of thing.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" continued Pembury; \"it's rubbish, and unreadable; and\nthough they condescend to let us see it, I don't suppose two fellows in\nthe Form ever wade through it.\"\n\n\"I know _I don't_, for one,\" says Wraysford, laughing; \"I _did_ make a\nstart at that ode on the birth of Senior junior in the last, which began\nwith--\n\n  \"`Hark, 'tis the wail of an infant that wakes the still echoes of\n  lofty Olympus,'\n\n\"but I got no farther.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says Tom Senior, \"Wren wrote that.  I felt it my duty to\nchallenge him for insulting the family, you know.  But he said it was\nmeant as a compliment, and that the Doctor was greatly pleased with it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Pembury, laughing, \"they won't allow any of us to\ncontribute.  I suggested it to the editor, and he said (you know his\nstuck-up way), `They saw no reason for opening their columns to any but\nSixth Form fellows.'  So what I propose is, that we get up a paper of\nour own!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, it's a splendid idea!\" exclaimed Wraysford, jumping up in\nraptures.  And every one else applauded Pembury's proposition.\n\n\"We've as good a right, you know,\" he continued, \"as they have, and\nought to be able to turn out quite as respectable a paper.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" says Ricketts, \"if you'll only get the fellows to write.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll manage that,\" said Anthony.\n\n\"Of course you'll have to be editor, Tony,\" says Bullinger.\n\n\"If you like,\" says the bashful Tony, who had no notion of _not_ being\neditor.\n\n\"Well, I call that a splendid idea,\" says Braddy.  \"Won't they be in a\nfury?  (Look here, Senior, I wish you wouldn't stick your pins into my\nneck, do you hear?)\"\n\n\"What shall we call it?\" some one asks.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" says Pembury, \"we ought to give it a good name.\"\n\n\"Call it the _Senior Wrangler_,\" suggested Ricketts.\n\n\"Sounds too like a family concern,\" cried Tom Senior.\n\n\"Suppose we call it the _Fifth Form War Whoop_,\" proposed Wraysford,\namid much laughter.\n\n\"Or the _Anti-Sixth_,\" says Braddy, who always professes an implacable\nenmity towards the Sixth when none of them are near to hear him.\n\n\"Not at all,\" says Greenfield, speaking now for the first time.  \"What's\nthe use of making fools of ourselves?  Call it the _Dominican_, and let\nit be a paper for the whole school.\"\n\n\"Greenfield is right,\" adds Pembury.  \"If we can make it a regular\nschool paper it will be a far better slap at the Sixth than if we did\nnothing but pitch into them.  Look here, you fellows, leave it to me to\nget out the first number.  We'll astonish the lives out of them--you\nsee!\"\n\nEvery one is far too confident of Tony's capacity to raise an objection\nto this proposal; and after a good deal more talk, in which the idea of\nthe _Dominican_ excites quite an enthusiasm among these amiable young\ngentlemen, the meeting breaks up.\n\nThat evening, as the fellows passed down the corridor to prayers, a new\nnotice appeared on the board:\n\n\"The first number of the _Dominican_ will appear on the 24th inst.\"\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asked Raleigh of the Sixth, the school captain, of\nhis companion, as they stopped to examine this mysterious announcement;\n\"there's no name to it.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's another prank of the Fifth.  By the way, do you see how\none of them has altered this debating society notice?\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Raleigh reading it, and smiling in spite of\nhimself, \"they are getting far too impudent.  I must send a monitor to\ncomplain of this.\"\n\nAnd so the two grandees walked on.\n\nLater in the evening Greenfield and Wraysford sat together in the study\nof the former.\n\n\"Well, I see the Nightingale is vacant at last.  Of course you are going\nin, old man?\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so; and you?\" asked the other.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  I'll have a shot, and do my best.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to let you have it, though,\" said Greenfield, \"for the\nmoney would be valuable to me if I ever go up to Oxford.\"\n\n\"Just the reason I want to get it,\" said Wraysford, laughing.  \"By the\nway, when is your young brother coming?\"\n\n\"This week, I expect.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he'll fag for me?\" asked Wraysford, mindful of his\ndestitute condition.\n\nGreenfield laughed.  \"You'd better ask the captain about that.  I can't\nanswer for him.  But I must be off now.  Good-night.\"\n\nAnd an hour after that Saint Dominic's was as still and silent as,\nduring the day, it had been bustling and noisy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. A NEW BOY.\n\n\"Good-Bye, my boy; God bless you! and don't forget to tell the\nhousekeeper about airing your flannel vests.\"\n\nWith this final benediction ringing in his ears, the train which was to\ncarry Master Stephen Greenfield from London to Saint Dominic's steamed\nslowly out of the station, leaving his widowed mother to return lonely\nand sorrowful to the home from which, before this day, her youngest son\nhad never wandered far without her.\n\nStephen, if the truth must be told, was hardly as affected by the\nparting as his poor mother.  Not that he was not sorry to leave home, or\nthat he did not love her he left behind; but with all the world before\nhim, he was at present far too excited to think of anything rationally.\nBesides, that last remark about the flannel vests had greatly disturbed\nhim.  The carriage was full of people, who must have heard it, and would\nbe sure to set him down as no end of a milksop and mollycoddle.\n\nHe blushed to the roots of his hair as he pulled up the window and sat\ndown in his corner, feeling quite certain every one of his\nfellow-travellers must be secretly smiling at his expense.  He wished\nhis mother would have whispered that last sentence.  It wasn't fair to\nhim.  In short, Stephen felt a trifle aggrieved; and, with a view to\nmanifesting his hardihood, and dispelling all false impressions caused\nby the maternal injunction, he let down the window and put his bare head\nout of it for about a quarter of an hour, until a speck of dust settled\nin his eye and drove him back to his seat.\n\nIt is decidedly awkward to get dust in your eye when you want to figure\nas a hero, for the eyes will water, and must be wiped, and that looks\nparticularly like weeping.  Stephen refrained from using his\nhandkerchief as long as he could; but it was no use; he must wipe his\neye in the presence of his fellow-passengers.  However, if he whistled a\ntune while doing so, no one could suspect him of real tears; so he\nstruck up, \"Glide along, my bonny boat,\" as cheerfully as he could, and\nmopped his smarting eye at the same time.  Alas! the dust only got\nfarther in, and the music, after half an hour's heroic perseverance,\nflagged altogether.  It was no use trying to appear heroic any longer,\nso, what with pain and a dawning sense of loneliness and home-sickness,\nStephen shed a _few_ real tears into his handkerchief, an indulgence\nwhich did him good in every way, for it not only relieved his drooping\nspirits, but washed that wretched piece of dust fairly out of its\nhiding-place.\n\nThis relief, with the aid of a bun and a bottle of ginger-beer at one of\nthe stations, set him, so to speak, on his feet again, and he was able\nto occupy the rest of his journey very pleasantly in drumming his heels\non the floor, and imagining to himself all the marvellous exploits which\nwere to mark his career at Saint Dominic's.  He was to be a prodigy in\nhis new school from the very first; in a few terms he was to be captain\nof the cricket club, and meanwhile was to gain the favour of the Sixth\nby helping them regularly in their lessons, and fighting any one against\nwhom a special champion should be requisite.  He was, indeed, just being\ninvited to dinner with the Doctor, who was about to consult him\nconcerning some points of school management, when the train suddenly\npulled up at Maltby, and his brother Oliver's head looked in at the\nwindow with a \"Hullo! here you are!  Tumble out!\"\n\nOliver and Stephen were Mrs Greenfield's only children.  Their father\nhad died twelve years ago, when Stephen was a baby, and the two boys had\nbeen left in charge of an uncle, who had carefully watched over their\neducation, and persuaded his sister to allow her elder boy to go to a\npublic school.  Mrs Greenfield had consented, with many tremblings, and\nOliver had, four years ago, been sent to Saint Dominic's, where he was\nnow one of the head boys in the Fifth Form.  Only a _few_ weeks before\nthe opening of this story the boys' uncle had died, leaving in his will\na provision for sending Stephen to the same school as his brother, or\nany other his mother might select.  The poor widow, loth to give up her\nboy, yet fain to accept the offer held out, chose to send Stephen to\nSaint Dominic's too, and this was the reason of that young gentleman's\npresent appearance on the stage at that centre of learning.\n\n\"I'll send up your traps by the carter; we can walk,\" said Oliver,\ntaking his young brother into charge.\n\nStephen was only too glad, as it gave him time to breathe before\nplunging at once into the scene of his future exploits.  \"Is it far?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Only a mile,\" said Oliver; \"come on.  Hullo, Rick, where have you been\nto?\"\n\nThis was addressed to Ricketts, whom they met just outside the station.\n\n\"Oh! to Sherren's about my togs.  I wanted them for the match to-morrow,\nyou know.  I've told him if he doesn't send them up in time we'll all\nget our things made in London, so I guess he'll hurry himself for once.\nOh, look here! did you get a paper with the result of the American\nmatch?  Bother!  Here, you kid, what's your name, cut back to the\nstation and get a daily.  Look sharp!  Bring it to me in my room.  Come\non, Greenfield.\"\n\nMaster Stephen looked so astonished at this cool request from a total\nstranger that both the elder boys laughed.\n\n\"This is my young brother, Rick, just come--\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Mr Ricketts, blushing, \"I'll go--\"\n\n\"No, I'll go,\" said Stephen, darting off, and expending a penny of his\nown to get this magnifico of the Fifth his paper.\n\nThis little incident served to break the ice for the new boy, who felt\nhighly honoured when Ricketts said he was \"much obliged to him.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" said Oliver, suddenly, \"I ought to get my togs up too.\nBother that Sherren!  I say, Rick, see my young brother up to the\nschool, will you? while I cut back; he can wait in my study.\"\n\nStephen felt very desolate to be left thus alone the moment after his\narrival, and it did not add to his pleasure to observe that Ricketts by\nno means appeared to look upon the task of seeing him to Saint Dominic's\nas a privilege.  They walked on in silence for about half a mile, and\nthen encountered several groups of boys strolling out along the road.\nRicketts stopped to talk to several of them, and was very nearly going\noff with one of the party, when he suddenly remembered his charge.  It\nwas rather humiliating this, for Stephen; and already his triumphal\nentry into Saint Dominic's was beginning to be shorn of some of its\nglory.  No one noticed him; and the only one that paid him the least\nattention appeared to look upon him as a nuisance.\n\n\"Here, Tony,\" suddenly shouted Ricketts to Pembury, who was jogging\nalong on his crutches a little way ahead, towards the school; \"do you\nmind showing this kid the way up?  I have to go back with Wren.  There's\na good fellow.\"\n\n\"Well, that's cool,\" replied Master Pembury; \"I'm not a kid-conductor!\nCome on, youngster; I suppose you haven't got a name, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Stephen Greenfield.\"\n\n\"Oh, brother of our dear friend Oliver; I hope you'll turn out a better\nboy than him, he's a shocking character.\"\n\nStephen looked concerned.  \"I'm sure he doesn't mean to do what's\nwrong,\" began he, apologetically.\n\n\"That's just it, my boy.  If he doesn't mean to do it, why on earth does\nhe do it?  I shall be sorry if he's expelled, very sorry.  But come on;\ndon't mind if I walk too fast,\" added he, hobbling along by Stephen's\nside.\n\nStephen did not know what to think.  If Ricketts had not addressed his\ncompanion as \"Tony\" he would have fancied he was one of the masters, he\nspoke with such an air of condescension.  Stephen felt very\nuncomfortable, too, to hear what had been told him about Oliver.  If he\nhad not been told, he could not have believed his brother was anything\nbut perfection.\n\n\"I'm lame, you see,\" said Pembury, presently.  \"You are quite sure you\nsee?  Look at my left leg.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Stephen, blushing; \"I--I hope it doesn't hurt.\"\n\n\"Only when I wash my face.  But never mind that Vulcan was lame too, but\nthen he never washed.  You know who Vulcan was, of course?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so,\" faltered Stephen, beginning to feel very uneasy\nand ignorant.\n\n\"Not know Vulcan!  My eye! where have you been brought up?  Then of\ncourse you don't know anything about the Tenth Fiji War?  No?  I thought\nnot.  Dreadful!  We shall have to see what you do know.  Come on.\"\n\nStephen entered Saint Dominic's thoroughly crestfallen, and fully\nconvinced he was the most ignorant boy that ever entered a public\nschool.  The crowds of boys in the playground frightened him, and even\nthe little boys inspired him with awe.  _They_, at any rate, had heard\nof Vulcan, and knew about the Tenth Fiji War!\n\n\"Here,\" said Anthony, \"is your brother's study.  Sit here till he\nreturns, and make the most of your time, for you'll have to put your\nbest foot foremost to-morrow in the Doctor's examination.\"\n\nSo saying, he left abruptly, and the poor lad found himself alone, in\nabout as miserable a frame of mind as a new boy would wish to be in.\n\nHe looked about the study; there were some shelves with books on them.\nThere was a little bed let into the wall on one side; there was an\neasy-chair, and what professed to be a sofa; and there was a pile of\nmiscellanies, consisting of bats and boots and collars and papers,\nheaped up in the corner, which appeared to be the most abundantly\nfurnished portion of the little room.  Stephen sat there, very dismal,\nand wishing himself home again once more, when the door suddenly opened\nand a small boy of his own age appeared.\n\n\"Hullo!  What do you want?\" demanded this hero.\n\n\"I'm waiting for my brother.\"\n\n\"Who's your brother?\"\n\n\"Oliver Greenfield.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right! you can get his tea as well as I can; you'll find all\nthe things in the cupboard there.  And look here, tell him Bullinger\nwants to know if he can lend him some jam--about half a pint, tell him.\"\n\nPoor Stephen! even the small boys ordered him about, and regarded him as\nnobody.  He would fain have inquired of this young gentleman something\nabout Vulcan, and have had the advantage of his experience in the\npreparation of his brother's tea; but the youth seemed pressed for time,\nand vanished.\n\nAs well as he could, Stephen extricated the paraphernalia of his\nbrother's tea-table from the cupboard, and set it out in order on the\ntable, making the tea as well as profound inexperience of the mystery\nand a kettle full of lukewarm water would permit.  Then he sat and\nwaited.\n\nBefore Oliver arrived, four visitors broke in upon Stephen's vigil.  The\nfirst came \"to borrow\" some tea, and helped himself coolly to two\nteaspoonfuls out of Oliver's canister.  Stephen stood by aghast and\nspeechless.\n\n\"Tell him I'll _owe_ it him,\" calmly remarked the young gentleman, as he\ndeparted with his booty, whistling a cheerful ditty.\n\nThen a fag came in and took a spoon, and after him another fag, with a\nmug, into which he poured half of the contents of Oliver's milk-jug; and\nfinally a big fellow rushed in in a desperate hurry and snatched up a\nchair and made off with it.\n\nStephen wondered the roof of Saint Dominic's did not fall in upon these\nshameless marauders, and was just contemplating putting the stores all\nback again into the cupboard to prevent further piracy, when the welcome\nsound of Oliver's voice in the passage put an end to further suspense.\n\n\"Well, here you are,\" said Oliver, entering with a friend.  \"Wray, this\nis my young brother, just turned up.\"\n\n\"How are you?\" said Wraysford, in a voice which won over Stephen at\nonce; \"I heard you were coming.  Have you--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" suddenly ejaculated Oliver, lifting up the lid of his teapot.  \"If\nthat young wretch Paul hasn't been and made my tea with coal-dust and\ncold water!  I'd like to scrag him!  And--upon my word--oh, this is too\nmuch!--just look, Wray, how he's laid the table out!  Those Guinea-pigs\nare beyond all patience.  Where _is_ the beggar?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Stephen, starting up, very red in the face, as his\nbrother went to the door; \"it wasn't him.  I made the tea.  The boy told\nme to, and I didn't know the way.  I had to guess.\"\n\nOliver and Wraysford both burst out laughing.\n\n\"A pretty good guess, too, youngster,\" said Wraysford.  \"When you come\nand fag for me I'll give you a few lessons to begin with.\"\n\n\"Oh! by the way, Wray,\" said Oliver, \"that's all knocked on the head.\nLoman makes out the captain promised him the first new boy that came.\nI'm awfully sorry.\"\n\n\"Just like Loman's cheek.  I believe he did it on purpose to spite me or\nyou.  I say, Greenfield, I'd kick-up a row about it if I were you.\"\n\n\"What's the use, if the captain says so?\" answered Oliver.  \"Besides,\nLoman's a monitor, bad luck to him!\"\n\n\"Loman's a fellow I don't take a great fancy to,\" said Wraysford.  \"I\nwouldn't care for a young brother of mine to fag to him.\"\n\n\"You are prejudiced, old man,\" said Oliver.  \"But I wish all the same\nStephen was to fag for you.  It's a pity, but it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"I'll speak to the captain, anyhow,\" growled Wraysford, sitting down to\nhis tea.\n\nAll this was not very pleasant for Stephen, who gathered that he was\ndestined to serve a not very desirable personage in the capacity of fag,\ninstead of, as he would have liked, his brother's friend Wraysford.\n\nHowever, he did justice to the tea, bad as it was, and the sardines\nOliver had brought from Maltby.  He was relieved, too, to find that his\nbrother was not greatly exasperated on hearing of the various raids\nwhich had been made on his provisions, or greatly disconcerted at Mr\nBullinger's modest request for half a pint of jam.\n\nThen, as the talk fell upon home, and cricket, and other cheerful\ntopics, the small boy gradually forgot his troubles, even down to the\nFiji War, and finished up his first evening at Saint Dominic's in a good\ndeal more cheerful frame of mind than that in which he had begun it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. A MORNING WITH A TADPOLE.\n\nIt so happened that on the day following Stephen Greenfield's arrival at\nSaint Dominic's, the head master, Dr Senior, was absent.\n\nThis circumstance gave great satisfaction to the new boy when his\nbrother told him of it, as it put off for another twenty-four hours the\nawful moment when he would be forced to expose his ignorance before that\nterrible personage.\n\n\"You'd better stick about in my room while I'm in school,\" said Oliver,\n\"and then you can come down to the cricket-field and see the practice.\nBy the way, some of the fellows may be in to bag my ink; they always run\nshort on Friday; but don't let them take it, for I shall want it\nto-night.  Ta, ta; give my love to the _mater_ if you're writing home.\nI'll be back for you after the twelve bell.\"\n\nAnd off he went, leaving Stephen to follow his own sweet devices for\nthree hours.\n\nThat young gentleman was at no loss how to occupy part of the time.  He\nmust write home.  So after much searching he unearthed a crumpled sheet\nof note-paper from one of the drawers, and set himself to his task.  As\nhe wrote, and his thoughts flew back to the home and the mother he had\nleft only yesterday, his spirits fell, and the home-sickness came over\nhim worse than ever.  What would he not give to change places with this\nvery letter, and go back home!\n\nHere, no one cared for him, every one seemed to despise him.  He wasn't\nused to those rough public schools, and would never get on at Saint\nDominic's.  Ah! that wretched Tenth Fiji War.  What _would_ become of\nhim to-morrow when the Doctor would be back?  There was no one to help\nhim.  Even Oliver seemed determined to let him fight his own battles.\n\nPoor boy!  He sat back in his chair and let his mind wander once more\nback to the snug little home he had left.  And, as he did so, his eyes\nunconsciously filled with tears, and he felt as if he would give\nanything to escape from Saint Dominic's.\n\nAt this moment the door opened and a small boy entered.\n\nHe did not seem to expect to find any one in the room, for he uttered a\nhurried \"Hullo!\" as he caught sight of Stephen.\n\nStephen quickly dashed away a tear and looked up.\n\n\"Where's Greenfield?\" demanded the small boy.\n\n\"He's in school,\" replied Stephen.\n\n\"Hullo! what are you blubbering at?\" cried the small boy, growing very\nbold and patronising all of a sudden, \"eh?\"\n\nStephen did not answer this home question.\n\n\"I suppose you are a new kid, just left your mammy?\" observed the other,\nwith the air of a man of forty; \"what's your name, young 'un?\"\n\n\"Stephen Greenfield.\"\n\n\"Oh, my! is it?  What form are you in?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"Haven't you been examined?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course; old Senior's away.  Never mind, you'll catch it\nto-morrow, blub-baby!\"\n\nThis last epithet was thrown in in such a very gratuitous and offensive\nway, that Stephen did not exactly like it.\n\nThe small youth, however, finding himself in a bantering mood, pursued\nhis questions with increasing venom.\n\n\"I suppose they call you Steenie at home?\" he observed, with a sneer\nthat was meant to be quite annihilating.\n\n\"No, they don't,\" replied Stephen; \"mother calls me Steevie.\"\n\n\"Oh, Steevie, does she?  Well, Steevie, were you ever licked over the\nknuckles with a ruler?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Stephen; \"why?\"\n\n\"Because you will be--I know who'll do it, too, and kick you on the\nshins, too, if you're cheeky!\"\n\nStephen was quite at a loss whether to receive this piece of news in the\nlight of information or a threat.  He was inclined to believe it the\nlatter; and as he was a rash youth, he somewhat tartly replied, \"_You_\nwon't!\"\n\nThe small boy looked astounded--not that he ever contemplated attempting\nthe chastisement about which he had talked; but the idea of a new boy\ndefying _him_, one of the chosen leaders of the Tadpoles, who had been\nat Saint Dominic's two years, was amazing.  He glared at the rash\nStephen for half a minute, and then broke out, \"Won't I? that's all! you\nsee, you pretty little blubber boy!  Yow-ow-ow! little sneak! why don't\nyou cut behind your mammy's skirt, if you're afraid?  I would cry if I\nwere you.  Where's his bottle?  Poor infant!  Yow-ow-boo-boo!\"\n\nThis tornado, delivered with increasing vehemence and offensiveness,\nquite overpowered Stephen, who stared at the boy as if he had been a\ntalking frog.\n\nThat youth evidently seemed to expect that his speech would produce a\nfar deeper impression than it did, for he looked quite angry when\nStephen made no reply.\n\n\"Wretched little sneak!\" the amiable one continued; \"I suppose he'll go\npeaching to his big brother.  Never mind, _we'll_ pay you out, see if we\ndon't!  Go and kiss your mammy, and tell your big brother what they did\nto little duckie Steevie, did they then? they shouldn't!  Give him a\nsuck of his bottle! oh, my!\" and he finished up with a most withering\nlaugh.  Then, suddenly remembering his errand, he walked up to the\ntable, and said, \"I want that inkpot!\"\n\nNow was Stephen's time.  He was just in the humour for an argument with\nthis young Philistine.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"What's that to you? give it up!\"\n\n\"I shan't give it up; Oliver said it was not to be taken.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" yelled the small boy, almost beside himself with rage\nand astonishment.  \"It's my brother's ink, and I'm not to give it up,\"\nsaid Stephen, shutting the top and keeping his hand on it.\n\nIt was enough!  The patriarch of the Tadpoles knew his strong point was\nin words rather than action; but this could not be endured.  At whatever\nrisk, the dignity of his order must be maintained, and this insolent,\nmad new boy must be--kicked.\n\n\"I'll kick you on the legs if you don't give it up,\" said the Tadpole,\nin a suppressed white heat.\n\nStephen said nothing, but kept his hand on the pot, and awaited what was\nto follow.\n\nThe hero stepped back a pace or two, to allow of a run worthy of the\ncoming kick; and what might have happened no one knows.  At that moment\nthe door opened, and Pembury entered on his crutches.\n\nAt sight of this Fifth Form celebrity the Tadpole cringed and cowered,\nand tried to sneak out of the study unobserved.  But Anthony was too\nquick for him.  Gently hooking him by the coat-collar with the end of a\ncrutch, he brought him back.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is,\" shouted Stephen; \"he's been trying to take, away Oliver's\nink.\"\n\n\"Silence, young gentleman, pray!\" said Pembury, very grandly.  Then,\nturning to the Tadpole, he added, \"Oh, so you've been trying to bag some\nink, have you?\"\n\n\"Well, I only wanted a little; and this--\"\n\n\"Silence! how much ink did you want?\"\n\n\"Only half a potful.\"\n\n\"You shall have half a potful!\" said Pembury.  \"Come here.\"\n\nThe Tadpole obeyed, and glared triumphantly at Stephen.\n\n\"Now, Master Greenfield,\" said Pembury, addressing Stephen; \"have the\nkindness to hand me the ink.\"\n\nStephen hesitated; he felt _sure_ Anthony was a master; and yet Oliver's\ndirections had been explicit.\n\n\"Do you hear?\" thundered Anthony.\n\n\"Do you hear?\" squeaked the Tadpole, delighted to have the tables turned\non his adversary.\n\n\"Oliver said I wasn't to let it go,\" faltered Stephen.\n\n\"Do you hear me, sir?\" again demanded Anthony.\n\n\"Do you hear? give it up!\" again squeaked the Tadpole.\n\nStephen sighed, and surrendered the inkpot.  There was an air of\nauthority about Pembury which he dared not defy.\n\n\"Now, Master Tadpole, here's your ink; half a pot you said?  Put your\nhands behind you, and stir if you dare!\" and Pembury looked so awful as\nhe spoke that the wretched boy was quite petrified.\n\nThe Fifth Form boy then solemnly emptied half the inkpot on to the top\nof the young gentleman's head, who ventured neither by word nor gesture\nto protest.\n\n\"Now you can go, sir!\" and without another word he led the small youth,\ndown whose face trickled a dozen tiny streams of black, making it look\nvery like a gridiron, to the door, and there gently but firmly handed\nhim into the passage.  The wretched youth flew off to proclaim his\nsorrows to his confederates, and vow vengeance all over Tadpole and\nGuinea-pig-land against his tormentor and the new boy, who was the\nauthor of all his humiliation.\n\nPembury meanwhile returned to Stephen.  That young gentleman had felt\nhis belief in Pembury's authority somewhat shaken by this unusual mode\nof punishment, but the Fifth Form boy soon reassumed his ascendency.  He\nproduced from his pocket a paper, and thus addressed Stephen: \"Dr\nSenior regrets that he should be absent at such an important time in the\nhistory of Saint Dominic's as the day of your arrival, Master\nGreenfield, but he will be back to-morrow.  Meanwhile, you are to occupy\nyourself with answering the questions on this paper, and take the\nanswers to the head master's study at ten to-morrow.  Of course you will\nnot be so dishonourable as to show the questions to any one, not even\nyour brother, or attempt to get the slightest help in answering them.\nGood-bye, my boy.  Don't trouble to stare at my left leg, if it _is_\nshorter than the other.  Good-bye.\"\n\nPoor Stephen felt so confused by the whole of this oration, particularly\nthe last sentence, which made him blush scarlet with shame, that for\nsome time after the lame boy had hobbled off he could not bring himself\nto look at the paper.  At last, however, he took it up.\n\nThis, then, was the awful examination paper which was to determine his\nposition at Saint Dominic's, or else expose his ignorance to the scorn\nof his masters.  How he wished he was on the other side of it, and that\nthe ordeal was over!\n\n\"Question 1.  Grammar.  Parse the sentence, `Oh, ah!' and state the\ngender of the following substantives: `and,' `look,' `here.'\"\n\nStephen scratched his head and rubbed his eyes.  This was not like\nanything he had learned at home.  They must learn out of quite different\nbooks at Saint Dominic's.\n\n\"Question 2.  History--\"\n\n\"Hullo,\" thought Stephen, \"they don't give many questions in grammar;\nthat's a good job.\"\n\n\"Question 2.  History.  Whose daughter was Stephen the Second, and why\nwas he nicknamed the `Green?'\"\n\nStephen laughed.  He had found out a mistake in his examiners.\n\"`Daughter,' the paper said, should be `son' of course.  Funny for Dr\nSenior to make such a slip,\" thought he.\n\n\"Question 3.  History and Geography.  Who built England? and state the\nlatitude and longitude of Saint Dominic's, and the boundaries of Gusset\nWeir.\"\n\n\"_However_ am I to know?\" murmured Stephen, in despair.  \"I was never\nhere before in my life.  Oh, dear, I shall _never_ pass!\"\n\n\"Question 4.  Compound Theology.  Give a sketch of the rise and history\nof the Dominicans from the time of Herod the Conqueror to the death of\nTitmus.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" was Stephen's despairing ejaculation.  \"I never heard of Titmus;\nit sounds like a Latin name.\"\n\n\"Question 5.  Pure Theology.  Who was Mr Finis?  Give a list of the\nworks bearing his signature, with a short abstract of their contents.\nWhat is he particularly celebrated for?\"\n\n\"Mr Finis?\" groaned Stephen.  \"How can they expect a boy like me to\nknow who he was?  And yet I seem to know the name.  Oh dear me!\"\n\n\"Question 6, and last but one,\" (\"That's a comfort,\" sighed Stephen).\n\"Mathematics.  What is a minus?  Describe its shape, and say how many\nare left when the whole is divided by seven.  Reduce your answer to\nvulgar decimals.\"\n\n\"I'm certain I can never do that.  Minus?  Minus?  I know the name, too.\nBut here's the last.\"\n\n\"Question 7.  Miscellaneous.  Give a brief history of your own life from\nthe earliest times, being particular to state your vicious deeds in\nchronological order.\"\n\nStephen sighed a sigh of relief.  \"I can answer that, after a fashion,\"\nhe said; \"but I can't even then be sure of all the dates.  As for the\nothers--\" and he dashed the paper down on the table with an air of\nbewildered despair.\n\n\"What am I to do?  They are all too hard for me.  Oh!  I wish I might\njust show them to Oliver.  If I was only at home, mother could help me.\nOh, dear!  I wish I had never come here!\"\n\nAnd he gave himself over to the extreme of misery, and sat staring at\nthe wall until the twelve bell rang, and Oliver and Wraysford broke in\non his solitude.\n\n\"Hullo, young 'un; in the dumps?  Never mind; you'll be used to it in a\nday or two, won't he, Wray?\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" said Wraysford, cheerily; \"it's hard lines at\nfirst.  Keep your pecker up, young 'un.\"\n\nThe young 'un, despite this friendly advice, felt very far from keeping\nup his pecker.  But he did his best, and worked his face into a\nmelancholy sort of a smile.\n\n\"Fish us my spike shoes out of that cupboard, Stee, there's a good\nfellow,\" said Oliver, \"and come along to the cricket-field.  There's a\nbig practice on this afternoon.\"\n\nStephen hesitated.\n\n\"I've got to do my exam before ten to-morrow.  Some one brought me up\nthe paper and said so.  Perhaps I'd better stop here and do it?\"\n\n\"I thought you weren't to be had up till the Doctor came back.  Who\nbrought you the paper?  I suppose it was Jellicott, the second master?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Stephen, who had never heard of Mr Jellicott in\nhis life before.\n\n\"Let's have a look at it,\" said the elder brother.\n\n\"I promised I wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, all serene; I only wanted to see the questions.  It's a new dodge\ngiving papers, isn't it, Wray?  We were examined _viva voce_ in the\nDoctor's study.  Well, come on, old man, or we shall be late.  You'll\nhave lots of time for that this evening.\"\n\nAnd off they went, the wretched Stephen wrestling mentally with his\nproblems all the while.\n\nOf course, profound reader, you have made the brilliant discovery by\nthis time that Master Stephen Greenfield was a very green boy.  So were\nyou and I at his age; and so, after all, we are now.  For the more we\nthink we know, the greener we shall find we are; that's a fact!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. FAGGING.\n\nThere is a queer elasticity about boys which no one, least of all\nthemselves, can account for.  A quarter of an hour after the big\npractice had begun Stephen had forgotten all about his examination, and\ncould think of nothing but cricket.\n\nAs he sat cross-legged on the grass among half a dozen youngsters like\nhimself, he even began to forget that he was a new boy, and was\nsurprised to find himself holding familiar converse with one and another\nof his companions.\n\n\"Well bowled, sir!\" shouted Master Paul, as a very swift ball from\nRicketts took Bullinger's middle stump clean out of the\nground--\"rattling well bowled!  I say,\" he added, turning round; \"if\nRicketts bowls like that to-day week, the others will be nowhere.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Stephen, to whom this remark seemed to be addressed.\n\nMaster Paul looked sharply round.\n\n\"Hullo, young 'un, is that you?  Jolly good play, isn't it?  Who are you\nfor, A or Z?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Mean?  Do you back the A's or the Z's? that's what I mean.  Oh, I\nsuppose you don't twig, though.  A to M, you know, against N to Z.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Stephen, \"I back the A to M's, of course; my brother is in\nthat half.\"\n\n\"So he is--isn't that him going in now?  Yes; you see if Ricketts\ndoesn't get him out in the first over!\"\n\nStephen watched most eagerly and anxiously.  They were not playing a\nregular game, only standing up to be bowled at in front of the nets, or\nfielding at fixed places; but each ball, and each hit, and each piece of\nfielding, was watched and applauded as if a victory depended on it, for\nout of those playing to-day the two elevens for the Alphabet match were\nto be chosen; and out of those two elevens, as every one knew, the\nSchool eleven, which would play the County in June, was to be selected.\nOliver, despite Paul's prophecy, stood out several overs of Rickett's,\nand Loman's, and the school captain's, one after the other, cutting some\nof their balls very hard, and keeping a very steady guard over his\nwicket.  At last a ball of Loman's got past him and snicked off his\nbails.\n\nStephen looked inquiringly round at Paul, and then at the small knot of\nSixth fellows who were making notes of each candidate's play.\n\n\"He's all right,\" said Paul; \"I guess Raleigh,\" (that was the school\ncaptain) \"didn't fancy his balls being licked about like that.  Never\nmind--there goes Braddy in.\"\n\nAnd so the practice went on, each candidate for the honour of a place in\nthe eleven submitting to the ordeal, and being applauded or despised\naccording as he acquitted himself.  Wraysford, of course, came out of\nthe trial well, as he always did.\n\n\"I declare, the Fifth could lick the Sixth this year, Tom,\" said Pembury\nto Tom Senior, as they sat together looking on.\n\n\"I'm sure they could; I hope we challenge them.\"\n\nJust then a Sixth Form fellow strolled up to where the speakers were\nstanding.\n\n\"I say, Loman,\" said Pembury, \"we were just saying our men could lick\nyours all to fits.  Don't you think so yourself?\"\n\n\"Can't say I do; but you are such a wonderful lot of heroes, you Fifth,\nthat there's no saying what you couldn't do if you tried,\" replied\nLoman, with a sneer.\n\n\"But you take such precious good care we shall not try, that's just it,\"\nsaid Pembury, winking at his companion.  \"Never mind, we'll astonish you\nsome day,\" growled the editor of the _Dominican_ as he hobbled away.\n\nLoman strolled up to where the small boys were sitting.\n\n\"Which of you is young Greenfield?\" he said.\n\n\"I am,\" said Stephen, promptly.\n\n\"Run with this letter to the post, then, and bring me back some stamps\nwhile you are there, and get tea ready for two in my study by half-past\nsix--do you hear?\"\n\nAnd off he went, leaving Stephen gaping at the letter in his hand, and\nquite bewildered as to the orders about tea.\n\nMaster Paul enjoyed his perplexity.\n\n\"I suppose you thought you were going to get off fagging.  I say, you'll\nhave to take that letter sharp, or you'll be late.\"\n\n\"Where's the post-office?\"\n\n\"About a mile down Maltby Road.  Look here, as you are going there, get\nme a pound of raisins, will you?--there's a good chap.  We'll square up\nto-night.\"\n\nStephen got up and started on his errands in great disgust.\n\nHe didn't see why he was to be ordered about and sent jobs for the other\nboys, just at a time, too, when he was enjoying himself.  However, it\ncouldn't be helped.\n\nThree or four fellows stopped him as he walked with the letter in his\nhand to the gates.\n\n\"Oh, are you going to the post?  Look here, young 'un, just call in at\nSplicer's about my bat, will you? thanks awfully!\" said one.\n\nAnother wanted him to buy a sixpenny novel at the library; a third\ncommissioned him to invest threepence in \"mixed sweets, chiefly\npeppermint;\" and a fourth to call at Grounding, the naturalist's, with a\ndead white mouse which the owner wanted stuffed.\n\nAfter this, Stephen--already becoming a little more knowing--stuffed the\nletter in his pocket, and took care, if ever he passed any one, not to\nlook as if he was going anywhere, for fear of being entrusted with a\nfurther mission.\n\nHe discharged all his errands to the best of his ability, including that\nrelating to the dead mouse, which he had great difficulty in rescuing\nfrom the clutches of a hungry dog on the way down, and then returned\nwith Paul's raisins in one pocket, the mixed sweets in another, the book\nin another, and the other boy's bat over his shoulder.\n\nPaul was awaiting him at the gate of Saint Dominic's.\n\n\"Got them?\" he shouted out, when Stephen was still twenty yards off.\n\nStephen nodded.\n\n\"How much?\" inquired Paul.\n\n\"Eighteenpence.\"\n\n\"You duffer!  I didn't mean them--pudding raisins I meant, about\nsixpence.  I say, you'd better take them back, hadn't you?\"\n\nThis was gratitude!  \"I can't now,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"I've got to get somebody's tea ready--I say, where's his study?\"\n\n\"Whose?  Loman's?  Oh, it's about the eighth on the right in the third\npassage; next to the one with the kicks on it.  What a young muff you\nare to get this kind of raisin!  I say, you'd have plenty of time to\nchange them.\"\n\n\"I really wouldn't,\" said Stephen, hurrying off, and perhaps guessing\nthat before he met Mr Paul again the raisins would be past changing.\n\nThe boy to whom belonged the mixed sweets was no more grateful than Paul\nhad been.\n\n\"You've chosen the very ones I hate,\" he said, surveying the selection\nwith a look of disgust.\n\n\"You said peppermint,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"But I didn't say green, beastly things!\" grumbled the other.  \"Here,\nyou can have one of them, it's sure to make you sick!\"\n\nStephen said \"Thank you,\" and went off to deliver up the bat.\n\n\"What a time you've been!\" was all the thanks he got in that quarter.\n\"Why couldn't you come straight back with it?\"\n\nThis was gratifying.  Stephen was learning at least one lesson that\nafternoon--that a fag, if he ever expects to be thanked for anything he\ndoes, is greatly mistaken.  He went off in a highly injured frame of\nmind to Loman's study.\n\nMaster Paul's directions might have been more explicit--\"The eighth door\non the right; next to the one with the kicks.\"  Now, as it happened, the\ndoor with the kicks on it was itself the eighth door on the right, with\na study on either side of it, and which of these two was Loman's Stephen\ncould not by the unaided light of nature determine.  He peeped into\nNumber 7; it was empty.\n\n\"Perhaps he's cut his name on the door,\" thought Stephen.\n\nHe might have done so, but as there were about fifty different letters\ncut on the door, he was not much wiser for that.\n\n\"I'd better look and see if his name is on his collars,\" Stephen next\nreflected, remembering with what care his mother had marked his own\nlinen.\n\nHe opened a drawer; it was full of jam-pots.  At that moment the door\nopened behind him, and the next thing Stephen was conscious of was that\nhe was half-stunned with a terrific box on the ears.\n\n\"Take that, you young thief!\" said the indignant owner of the study;\n\"I'll teach you to stick your finger in my jam.  What do you mean by\nit?\" and a cuff served as a comma between each sentence.\n\n\"I really didn't--I only wanted--I was looking for--\"\n\n\"That'll do; don't tell lies as well as steal; get away.\"\n\n\"I never stole anything!\" began Stephen, whose confusion was being\nrapidly followed by indignation at this unjust suspicion.\n\n\"That'll do.  A little boy like you shouldn't practise cheating.  Off\nyou go!  If I catch you again I'll take you to the Doctor.\"\n\nIn vain Stephen, now utterly indignant, and burning with a sense of\ninjustice, protested his innocence.  He could not get a hearing, and\npresently found himself out in the passage, the most miserable boy in\nall Saint Dominic's.\n\nHe wandered disconsolately along the corridor, trying hard to keep down\nhis tears, and determined to beg and beseech his brother to let him\nreturn home that very evening, when Loman and a friend confronted him.\n\n\"Hullo, I say, is tea ready?\" demanded the former.\n\n\"No,\" said Stephen, half choking.\n\n\"Why ever not, when I told you?\"\n\nStephen looked at him, and tried to speak, and then finally burst into\ntears.\n\n\"Here's an oddity for you!  Why, what's the row, youngster?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" stammered Stephen.\n\n\"That's a queer thing to howl at.  If you were weeping because you\nhadn't made my tea, I could understand it.  Come along, I'll show you\nhow to do it this time, young greenhorn.\"\n\nStephen accompanied him mechanically, and was ushered into the study on\nthe other side of the door with the kicks to that in which he had been\nso grievously wronged.\n\nHe watched Loman prepare the meal, and was then allowed to depart, with\norders to be in the way, in case he should be wanted.\n\nPoor Stephen!  Things were going from bad to worse, and life was already\na burden to him.  And besides--that exam paper!  It now suddenly dawned\nupon him.  Here it was nearly seven o'clock, and by ten to-morrow he was\nto deliver it up to Dr Senior!\n\nHow _ever_ was he to get through it?  He darted off to Oliver's study.\nIt was empty, and he sat down, and drawing out the paper, made a dash at\nthe first question.\n\nThe answer _wouldn't_ come!  Parse \"Oh, ah!\"\n\n\"Oh\" is an interjection agreeing with \"ah.\"\n\n\"Ah\" is an interjection agreeing with \"oh.\"  It wouldn't do.  He must\ntry again.\n\n\"Why,\" cried the voice of Wraysford, half an hour later, \"here's a\npicture of industry for you, Greenfield.  That young brother of yours is\nbeginning well!\"\n\nStephen hurriedly caught up his papers for fear any one should catch a\nglimpse of the hopeless attempts at answers which he had written.  He\nwas greatly tempted to ask Oliver about \"Mr Finis,\" only he had\npromised not to get any help.\n\n\"Let's have a look at the questions,\" again demanded Oliver, but at that\nmoment Loman's voice sounded down the passage.\n\n\"Greenfield junior, where are you?\"\n\nStephen, quite glad of this excuse for again refusing to show that\nwretched paper, jumped up, and saying, \"There's Loman wants his tea\ncleared away,\" vanished out of the room.\n\nPoor Stephen!  There was little chance of another turn at his paper that\nnight.  By the time Loman's wants had been attended to, and his\ndirections for future fagging delivered, the prayer-bell rang, and for\nthe half-hour following prayers the new boy was hauled away by Master\nPaul into the land of the Guinea-pigs, there to make the acquaintance of\nsome of his future class-fellows, and to take part in a monster\nindignation meeting against the monitors for forbidding single wicket\ncricket in the passage, with a door for the wicket, an old inkpot for\nthe ball, and a ruler for the bat.  Stephen quite boiled with rage to\nhear of this act of tyranny, and vowed vengeance along with all the rest\ntwenty times over, and almost became reconciled with his enemy of the\nmorning (but not quite) in the sympathy of emotion which this\ndemonstration evoked.\n\nThen, just as the memory of that awful paper rushed back into his mind,\nand he was meditating sneaking off to his brother's study, the first\nbed-bell sounded.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Paul, \"or they'll bag our blankets.\"\n\nStephen, wondering, and shivering at the bare idea, raced along the\npassage and up the staircase with his youthful ally to the dormitory.\nThere they found they had been anticipated by the blanket-snatchers; and\nas they entered, one of these, the hero of the inky head, was\ndeliberately abstracting one of those articles of comfort from Stephen's\nown bed.\n\n\"There's young Bramble got your blanket, Greenfield,\" cried Paul, \"pitch\ninto him!\"\n\nStephen, nothing loth, marched up to Master Bramble and demanded his\nblanket.  A general engagement ensued, some of the inhabitants of the\ndormitory siding with Stephen, and some with Bramble, until it seemed as\nif the coveted blanket would have parted in twain.  In the midst of the\nconfusion a sentry at the door suddenly put his head in and shouted\n\"Nix!\"  The signal had a magical effect on all but the uninitiated\nStephen, who, profiting by his adversaries' surprise, made one desperate\ntug at his blanket, which he triumphantly rescued.\n\n\"Look sharp,\" said Paul, \"here comes Rastle.\"  Mr Rastle was the small\nboys' tutor and governor.  Stephen took the hint, and was very soon\ncurled up, with his brave blanket round him, in bed, where, despite the\ndespairing thought of his paper, the cruel injustice of the owner of the\njam-pots, and the general hardness of his lot, he could not help feeling\nhe was a good deal more at home at Saint Dominic's than he had ever yet\nfound himself.\n\nOf one thing he was determined.  He would be up at six next morning, and\nmake one last desperate dash at his exam paper.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. SHAKING DOWN TO WORK.\n\n\"Master Greenfield, junior, is to go to the head master's study at\nhalf-past nine,\" called out Mr Roach, the school porter, putting his\nhead into the dormitory, at seven o'clock next morning.\n\nStephen had been up an hour, making fearful and wonderful shots of\nanswers to his awful questions, half of which he had already ticked off\nas done for better or worse.  \"If I write _something_ down to each,\"\nthought he to himself, \"I might happen to get one thing right; it'll be\nbetter than putting down no answer at all.\"\n\n\"Half-past nine!\" said he to Paul, on hearing this announcement; \"_ten_\nwas the time I was told.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"The gentleman who gave me my paper.\"\n\n\"What paper? you don't have papers.  It's _viva voce_.\"\n\n\"I've got a paper, anyhow,\" said Stephen, \"and a precious hard one, too,\nand I've only half done it.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll have to go at half-past nine, or you'll catch it,\" said\nPaul.  \"I say, there's Loman calling you.\"\n\nStephen, who, since the indignation meeting last night, had felt himself\ngrow very rebellious against the monitors, did not choose to hear the\ncall in question, and tried his hardest to make another shot at his\npaper.  But he could not keep deaf when Loman himself opened the door,\nand pulling his ear inquired what he meant by not coming when he was\ntold?  The new boy then had to submit, and sulkily followed his lord to\nhis study, there to toast some bread at a smoky fire, and look for about\nhalf an hour for a stud that Loman said had rolled under the chest of\ndrawers, but which really had fallen into one of that gentleman's boots.\n\nBy the time these labours were over, and Stephen had secured a mouthful\nof breakfast in his brother's study, it was time to go down to prayers;\nand after prayers he had but just time to wonder what excuse he should\nmake for only answering half his questions, when the clock pointed to\nthe half-hour, and he had to scuttle off as hard as he could to the\nDoctor's study.\n\nDr Senior was a tall, bald man, with small, sharp eyes, and with a\nface as solemn as an owl's.  He looked up as Stephen entered.\n\n\"Come in, my man.  Let me see; Greenfield?  Oh, yes.  You got here on\nTuesday.  How old are you?\"\n\n\"Nearly eleven, sir,\" said Stephen, with the paper burning in his\npocket.\n\n\"Just so; and I dare say your brother has shown you over the school, and\nhelped to make you feel at home.  Now suppose we just run through what\nyou have learned at home.\"\n\nNow was the time.  With a sigh as deep as the pocket from which he\npulled it, Stephen produced that miserable paper.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" he began, \"I've not had time--\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said the Doctor; \"put that away, and let us get on.\"\n\nStephen stared.  \"It's the paper you gave me!\" he said.\n\nThe Doctor frowned.  \"I hope you are not a silly boy,\" he said, rather\ncrossly.\n\n\"I'm afraid they are all wrong,\" said Stephen; \"the questions were--\nwere--rather hard.\"\n\n\"What questions?\" exclaimed the Doctor, a trifle impatient, and a trifle\npuzzled.\n\n\"These you sent me,\" said Stephen, humbly handing in the paper.\n\n\"Hum! some mistake; let's see, perhaps Jellicott--ah!\" and he put on his\nglasses and unfolded the paper.\n\n\"Question 1.  Grammar!\" and then a cloud of amazement fell over the\nDoctor's face.  He looked sharply out from under his spectacles at\nStephen, who stood anxiously and nervously before him.  Then he glanced\nagain at the paper, and his mouth twitched now and then as he read the\nstring of questions, and the boy's desperate attempts to answer them.\n\n\"Humph!\" he said, when the operation was over, \"I'm afraid, Greenfield,\nyou are not a very clever boy--\"\n\n\"I know I'm not, sir,\" said Stephen, quite relieved that the Doctor did\nnot at once order him to quit Saint Dominic's.\n\n\"Or you would have seen that this paper was a practical joke.\"  Then it\nburst all of a sudden on Stephen.  And all this about \"Mr Finis\", \"Oh,\nah,\" and the rest of it had been a cruel hoax, and no more!\n\n\"Come, now, let us waste no more time.  I'm not surprised,\" said the\nDoctor, suppressing a smile by a very hard twitch; \"I'm not surprised\nyou found these questions hard.  How far have you got in arithmetic?\"\n\nAnd then the Doctor launched Stephen into a _viva voce_ examination, in\nwhich that young prodigy of learning acquitted himself far more\nfavourably than could have been imagined, and at the end of which he\nheard that he would be placed in the fourth junior class, where it would\nbe his duty to strain every nerve to advance, and make the best use of\nhis time at Saint Dominic's.  Then the Doctor rang his bell.\n\n\"Tell Mr Rastle kindly to step here,\" said he to the porter.\n\nMr Rastle appeared, and to his charge, after solemnly shaking hands and\npromising to be a paragon of industry and good conduct, Stephen was\nconsigned by the head master.\n\n\"By the way,\" said the Doctor, as Stephen was leaving, \"will you tell\nthe boy who gave you this paper I wish to see him?\"\n\nStephen, who had been too much elated by the result of the real\nexamination to recollect for the moment the trickery of the sham one,\nnow blushed very red as he remembered what a goose he had been, and\nundertook to obey the Doctor's order.  And this it was very easy to do.\nFor as he opened the study-door he saw Pembury just outside, leaning\nagainst the wall with his eyes on the clock as it struck ten.\n\nAs he caught sight of Stephen emerging from the head master's study, his\ncountenance fell, and he said eagerly and half-anxiously, \"Didn't I tell\nyou ten o'clock, Greenfield?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Doctor said half-past nine.  And you are a cad to make a\nfool of me,\" added Stephen, rising with indignation, \"and--and--and--\"\nand here he choked.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my young friend,\" said Pembury.  \"It's such a hard thing\nto make a fool of you that, you know, and--and--and--!\"\n\n\"I shall not speak to you,\" stammered Stephen.\n\n\"Oh, don't apologise,\" laughed Pembury.  \"Perhaps it would comfort you\nto kick me.  Please choose my right leg, as the other is off the ground,\neh?\"\n\n\"The Doctor wants to speak to you, he says,\" said Stephen.\n\nPembury's face fell again.  \"Do you mean to say he saw the paper, and\nyou told him?\" he said, angrily.\n\n\"I showed him the paper, because I thought he had sent it; but I didn't\ntell him who gave it to me.\"\n\n\"Then why does he want me?\"\n\n\"He wants the boy who gave me the paper, that's all he said,\" answered\nStephen, walking off sulkily to his quarters, and leaving Anthony to\nreceive the rebukes of Dr Senior, and make his apologies for his evil\ndeeds as best he could.\n\nThe offence after all was not a very terrible one, and Pembury got off\nwith a mild reprimand on the evils of practical joking, at the end of\nwhich he found himself in his usual amiable frame of mind, and\nharbouring no malice against his innocent victim.\n\n\"Greenfield,\" said he, when shortly afterwards he met Oliver, \"I owe\nyour young brother an apology.\"\n\n\"What on earth for?\"\n\n\"I set him an examination paper to answer, which I'm afraid caused him\nsome labour.  Never mind, it was all for the best.\"\n\n\"What, did that paper he was groaning over come from you?  What a shame,\nTony, to take advantage of a little beggar like him!\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry, tell him; but I say, Greenfield, it'll make a\nsplendid paragraph for the _Dominican_.  By the way, are you going to\nlet me have that poem you promised on the Guinea-pigs?\"\n\n\"I can't get on with it at all,\" said Oliver.  \"I'm stuck for a rhyme in\nthe second line.\"\n\n\"Oh, stick down anything.  How does it begin?\"\n\n  \"`Oh, dwellers in the land of dim perpetual,'\"\n\nbegan Oliver.\n\n\"Very good; let's see; how would this do?--\n\n  \"`I hate the day when first I met you all,\n  And this I undertake to bet you all,\n  One day I'll into trouble get you all,\n  And down the playground steps upset you all,\n  And with a garden hose I'll wet you all,\n  And then--'\"\n\n\"Oh, look here,\" said Oliver, \"that'll do.  You may as well finish the\nthing right out at that rate.\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear fellow.  It was just a sudden inspiration, you\nknow.  Don't mention it, and you may like to get off that rhyme into\nanother.  But I say, Greenfield, we shall have a stunning paper for the\nfirst one.  Tom Senior has written no end of a report of the last\nmeeting of the Sixth Form Debating Society, quite in the parliamentary\nstyle; and Bullinger is writing a history of Saint Dominic's, `gathered\nfrom the earliest sources,' as he says, in which he's taking off most of\nthe Sixth.  Simon is writing a love-ballad, which is sure to be fun; and\nRicketts is writing a review of Liddell and Scott's _Lexicon_; and\nWraysford is engaged on `The Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse.'\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Oliver, \"and what are _you_ writing?\"\n\n\"Oh, the leading article, you know, and the personal notes, and `Squeaks\nfrom Guineapigland and Tadpoleopolis,' and some of the advertisements.\nCome up to my study, you and Wray, this evening after prayers, I say,\nand we'll go through it.\"\n\nAnd off hobbled the editor of the _Dominican_, leaving Oliver greatly\nimpressed with his literary talents, especially in the matter of finding\nrhymes for \"perpetual.\"\n\nBy the time he and Wraysford went in the evening to read over what had\nbeen sent in, the poem on the Guinea-pigs was complete.\n\nThey found Pembury busy over a huge sheet of paper, the size of his\ntable.\n\n\"What on earth have you got there?\" cried Wraysford.\n\n\"The _Dominican_, to be sure,\" said Anthony, gravely.\n\n\"Nonsense! you are not going to get it out in that shape?\"\n\n\"I am, though.  Look here, you fellows,\" said Anthony, \"I'll show you\nthe dodge of the thing.  The different articles will either be copied or\npasted into this big sheet.  You see each of these columns is just the\nwidth of a sheet of school paper.  Well, here's a margin all round--do\nyou twig?--so that when the whole thing's made up it'll be ready for\nframing.\"\n\n\"Framing!\" exclaimed Greenfield and his friend.\n\n\"To be sure.  I'm getting a big frame, with glass, made for it, with the\ntitle of the paper in big letters painted on the wood.  So the way we\nshall publish it will be to hang it outside our class-room, and then\nevery one can come and read it who likes--much better than passing it\nround to one fellow at a time.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Tony, it's a capital notion,\" exclaimed Wraysford,\nclapping the lame boy on the back; \"it does you credit, my boy.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" said Tony; \"and don't whack me like that again, or\nI'll refuse to insert your `Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse.'\"\n\n\"But, I say,\" said Greenfield, \"are you sure they'll allow it to hang\nout there?  It may get knocked about.\"\n\n\"I dare say we may have a row with the monitors about it; but we must\nsquare them somehow.  We shall have to keep a fag posted beside it,\nthough, to protect it.\"\n\n\"And to say `Move on!' like the policemen,\" added Wraysford.  \"Well,\nit's evident you don't want any help, Tony, so I'll go.\"\n\n\"Good-bye; don't ask me to your study for supper, please.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry, I promised Bullinger.  I know he has a dozen\nsausages in his cupboard.  Come along there.  Are you coming,\nGreenfield?\"\n\nAnd the worthy friends separated for a season.\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen had made his _debut_ in the Fourth Junior.  He was\nput to sit at the bottom desk of the class, which happened to be next to\nthe desk owned by Master Bramble, the inky-headed blanket-snatcher.\nThis young gentleman, bearing in mind his double humiliation, seemed by\nno means gratified to find who his new neighbour was.\n\n\"Horrid young blub-baby!\" was his affectionate greeting, \"I don't want\nyou next to me.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said Stephen.  \"I was put here.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, because you're such an ignorant young sneak; that's why.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's why you were at the bottom before I came--oh!\"\n\nThe last exclamation was uttered aloud, being evoked by a dig from the\namiable Master Bramble's inky pen into Stephen's leg.\n\n\"Who was that?\" said Mr Rastle, looking up from his desk.\n\n\"Now then,\" whispered Bramble, \"sneak away--tell tales, and get me into\na row--I'll pay you!\"\n\nStephen, feeling himself called upon, stood up.\n\n\"It was me,\" he said.\n\n\"It was I, would be better grammar,\" said Mr Rastle, quietly.\n\nMr Rastle was a ruddy young man, with a very good-humoured face, and a\nsly smile constantly playing at the corners of his mouth.  He no doubt\nguessed the cause of the disturbance, for he asked, \"Was any one\npinching you?\"\n\n\"Go it,\" growled Bramble, in a savage whisper.  \"Say it was me, you\nsneak.\"\n\nStephen said, No, no one had pinched him; but finished up his sentence\nwith another \"Oh!\" as the gentle Bramble gave him a sharp side-kick on\nthe ankle as he stood.\n\nMr Rastle's face darkened as he perceived this last piece of by-play.\n\n\"Bramble,\" said he, \"oblige me by standing on the form for half an hour.\nI should be sorry to think you were as objectionable as your name\nimplies.  Sit down, Greenfield.\"\n\nAnd then the class resumed, with Master Bramble perched like a statue of\nthe sulky deity on his form, muttering threats against Greenfield all\nthe while, and the most scathing denunciations against all who might be\neven remotely connected with big brothers, and mammies, and blub-babies.\n\nStephen, who was beginning to feel himself much more at home at Saint\nDominic's, betrayed no visible terror at these menaces, and only once\ntook any notice of his exalted enemy, when the latter attempted not only\nto stand on the form, but upon a tail of Stephen's jacket, and a bit of\nthe flesh of his leg at the same time.  Then he gave the offending foot\na knock with his fist and an admonitory push.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" squeaked the lordly Bramble, \"Greenfield junior is trying\nto knock me over.\"\n\n\"I was not,\" shouted Stephen; \"he was squashing me with his foot, and I\nmoved it away.\"\n\n\"Really, Bramble,\" said Mr Rastle, \"you are either very unfortunate or\nvery badly behaved.  Come and stand on this empty form beside my desk.\nThere will be no danger here of `squashing' any one's leg or of being\nknocked over.  Come at once.\"\n\nSo Mr Bramble took no advantage by his last motion, and served the rest\nof his term of penal servitude, in the face of the entire class, under\nthe immediate eye of Mr Rastle.\n\nDirectly class was over, Stephen had to go and wait upon Loman for a\nparticular purpose, which the reader must hear of in due time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. MR CRIPPS THE YOUNGER.\n\nLoman was a comparatively new boy at Saint Dominic's.  He had entered\neighteen months ago, in the Fifth Form, having come direct from another\nschool.  He was what many persons would call an agreeable boy, although\nfor some reason or other he was never very popular.  What that something\nwas, no one could exactly define.  He was clever, and good-tempered, and\ninoffensive.  He rarely quarrelled or interfered with any one, and he\nhad been known to do more than one good-natured act.  But whether it was\nthat he was conceited, or selfish, or not quite straight, or a little\nbit of all three, he never made any very great friends at Saint\nDominic's, and since he had got into the Sixth and been made a monitor,\nhe had quite lost the favour of his old comrades in the Fifth.\n\nAs far as Wraysford and Greenfield were concerned, this absence of\ngoodwill had ripened into something like soreness, by the way in which\nLoman had made use of his own position as a monitor, on a casual\nreference by Oliver to the probable coming of Stephen to Saint\nDominic's, to secure that young gentleman as his fag, although he quite\nwell knew that Wraysford was counting on having him.  Though of course\nthe captain's word was final, the two friends felt that they had not\nbeen quite fairly dealt with in the matter.  They took no trouble to\nconceal what they thought from Loman himself, who seemed to derive\nconsiderable satisfaction from the fact, and to determine to keep his\nhand on the new boy quite as much for the sake of \"scoring off\" his\nrivals as on the fag's own account.\n\nLoman, Wraysford, and Greenfield _were_ rivals in more matters than one.\nThey were all three candidates for a place in the school eleven, and\nall three candidates for the Nightingale Scholarship next autumn; and\nbesides this, they each of them aspired to control the Junior\nDominicans; and it was a sore mortification to Loman to find that,\nthough a monitor, his influence among the small fry was by no means as\ngreat as that of the two Fifth Form boys, who were notoriously popular,\nand thought much of by their juniors.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the relations between the two friends and\nLoman were at the present time a little \"strained.\"\n\nTo Stephen, however, Loman was all civility.  He helped him in his\nlessons, and gave him the reversion of his feasts, and exercised his\nmonitorial authority against Master Bramble in a way that quite charmed\nthe new boy, and made him consider himself fortunate to have fallen into\nthe hands of so considerate a lord.\n\nWhen he entered Loman's study after his first morning's work in class,\nhe found that youth in a highly amiable frame of mind, and delighted to\nsee him.\n\n\"Hullo, Greenfield!\" he said; \"how are you? and how are you getting on?\nI hear you are in the Fourth Junior; all among the Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles, eh?  Which do you belong to?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Stephen; \"they are going to draw lots for me\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"That's a nice way of being elected!  I say, have you any classes this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"No; Mr Rastle has given us a half-holiday.\"\n\n\"That's just the thing.  I'm going to scull up the river a bit after\ndinner, and if you'd like you can come and steer for me.\"\n\nStephen was delighted.  Of all things he liked boating.  They lived near\na river at home, he said, and he always used to steer for Oliver there.\n\nSo, as soon as dinner was over, the two went down to the boathouse and\nembarked.\n\n\"Which way shall you row?\" asked Stephen, as he made himself comfortable\nin the stern of the boat, and took charge of the rudder-lines.\n\n\"Oh, up stream.  Keep close in to the bank, out of the current.\"\n\nIt was a beautiful afternoon, and Loman paddled lazily and luxuriously\nup, giving ample time to Stephen, if so inclined, to admire the wooded\nbanks and picturesque windings of the Shar.  Gusset Lock was reached in\ndue time, and here Loman suggested that Stephen should get out and go\nround and look at the weir, while he went on and took the boat through.\nStephen acceded and landed, and Loman paddled on to the lock.\n\n\"Hello, maister,\" called down a feeble old voice, as he got up to the\ngate.\n\n\"Hullo, Jeff, is Cripps about?\" replied Loman.\n\n\"Yas; he be inside or somewheres, maister,\" replied the old lock-keeper.\n\n\"All right! take the boat up; I want to see Cripps.\"\n\nCripps was the son of the old man whom Loman had addressed as Jeff.  He\nwas not exactly a gentleman, for he kept the Cockchafer public-house at\nMaltby, and often served behind the bar in his own person.  Neither was\nhe altogether a reputable person, for he frequently helped himself to an\noverdose of his own beverages, besides being a sharp hand at billiards,\nand possessing several packs of cards with extra aces in them.  Neither\nwas he a particularly refined personage, for his choice of words was\noften more expressive than romantic, and his ordinary conversation was\nfrequently the reverse of edifying; it mainly had to do with details of\nthe stable or the card-room, and the anecdotes with which he enlivened\nit were often \"broader than they were long,\" to put it mildly.  In\nshort, Cripps was a blackguard by practice, whatever he was by\nprofession.  He had, however, one redeeming virtue; he was very partial\nto young gentlemen, and would go a good bit out of his way to meet one.\nHe always managed to know of something that young gentlemen had a fancy\nfor.  He could put them into the way of getting a thoroughbred bull-dog\ndirt-cheap; he could put them up to all the tips at billiards and \"Nap,\"\nand he could make up a book for them on the Derby or any other race,\nthat was bound to win.  And he did it all in such a pleasant, frank way\nthat the young gentlemen quite fell in love with him, and entrusted\ntheir cash to him with as much confidence as if he were the Bank of\nEngland.\n\nOf all the young gentlemen whose privilege it had been to make the\nacquaintance of Mr Cripps--and there were a good many--he professed the\ngreatest esteem and admiration for Loman, of Saint Dominic's school, to\nwhom he had been only recently introduced.  The two had met at the\nlock-keeper's house a week ago, when Loman was detained there an hour or\ntwo by stress of weather, and, getting into conversation, as gentlemen\nnaturally would, Loman chanced to mention that he wanted to come across\na really good fishing-rod.\n\nBy a most curious coincidence, Mr Cripps had only the other day been\nasked by a particular friend of his, who was removing from the country\nto London--\"where,\" said Mr Cripps, \"there ain't over much use for a\nrod,\"--if he knew of any one in want of a really good fishing-rod.  It\nwas none of your ordinary ones, made out of green wood with pewter\njoints, but a regular first-class article, and would do for trout or\nperch or jack, or any mortal fish you could think of.  Cripps had seen\nit, and flattered himself he knew something about rods, but had never\nseen one to beat this.  Reel and all, too, and a book of flies into the\nbargain, if he liked.  He had been strongly tempted to get it for\nhimself--it seemed a downright sin to let such a beauty go--and would\nhave it if he had not already got a rod, but of a far inferior sort, of\nhis own.  And he believed his friend would part with it cheap.\n\n\"I tell you what, young gentleman,\" said he, \"I'll bring it up with me\nnext time I come, and you shall have a look at it.  Of course, you can\ntake it or not, as you like, but if my advice is worth anything--well,\nnever mind, I suppose you are sure to be up stream in the course of the\nnext week or so.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Loman, who in the presence of this universal genius was\nquite deferential; \"when can you bring it?\"\n\n\"Well, my time ain't so very valuable, and I'd like to oblige you over\nthis little affair.  Suppose we say to-day week.  I'll have the rod\nhere, and you can try him.\"\n\n\"Thank you--have you--that is--about what--\"\n\n\"You mean, about what figure will he want for it?  Well, I don't know\nexactly.  They run so very various, do good rods.  You could get what\nthey call a rod for ten bob, I dare say.  But _you_ wouldn't hardly\nfancy that style of thing.\"\n\n\"Oh no; if it was a really good one,\" said Loman, \"I wouldn't mind\ngiving a good price.  I don't want a rotten one.\"\n\n\"That's just it.  This one I'm telling you of is as sound as a bell, and\nas strong as iron.  And _you_ know, as well as I do, these things are\nalways all the better after a little use.  My friend has only used this\ntwice.  But I'll find out about the price, and drop you a line, you\nknow.  May be 2 pounds or 3 pounds, or so.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's about what a really good rod ought to cost?\" said\nLoman, who liked to appear to know what was what, but secretly rather\ntaken aback by this estimate.\n\n\"So it is.  It's just a guess of mine though; but I know for _me_ he'll\nput it as low as he can.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shall be very much obliged to you,\" said Loman, \"if you can\nmanage it for me.\"\n\n\"Not at all, young gentleman.  I always like to oblige where I can;\nbesides, you would do as much for me, I'll wager.  Well, good-day, Mr--\nwhat's your name?\"\n\n\"Loman--at Saint Dominic's.  You'll send me a line, then about the\nprice?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Good-day, sir.\"\n\nBut Mr Cripps had forgotten to send the line, and to-day, when Loman,\naccording to arrangement, came up to the lock-keeper's to receive the\nrod, the keeper of the Cockchafer was most profuse in his apologies.  He\nwas most sorry, but his friend had been ill and not able to attend to\nbusiness.  He had been a _trifle_ afraid from what he heard that he was\nnot quite as anxious to part with that rod as formerly.  But Cripps had\ngone over on purpose and seen him, and got his promise that he should\nhave it to-morrow certain, and if Mr Loman would call or send up, it\nshould be ready for him, without fail.\n\nAt this stage, Stephen, having explored the weir, rejoined his\nschoolfellow, and the two, after partaking of a bottle of ginger-beer at\nMr Cripps's urgent request, returned with the stream to Saint\nDominic's.\n\nThe result of this delay was to make Loman doubly anxious to secure this\nfamous fishing-rod, on which his heart was set.  Next day, however, he\nhad classes all the afternoon, and could not go himself.  He therefore\ndetermined to send Stephen.\n\n\"I want you to run up to Gusset Weir,\" said he to his fag, \"to fetch me\na rod the keeper's son is getting for me.  Be quick back, will you? and\nask him what the price is.\"\n\nSo off Stephen trotted, as soon as school was over, in spite of the\ncounter attraction of a Guinea-pig cricket match.  When he reached the\nlock, Cripps had not arrived.\n\n\"He warn't be long, young maister,\" said old Jeff, who was one of the\nsnivelling order.  \"Take a seat, do 'ee.  Nice to be a young gemm'un, I\nsays--us poor coves as works wery 'ard, we'd like to be young gemm'un\ntoo, with lots o' money, and all so comfortable off.  Why, young\nmaister, you don't know now what it is to be in want of a shillun.  I\ndo!\"\n\nStephen promptly pulled out one of his five shillings of pocket-money in\nanswer to this appeal, and felt rather ashamed to appear \"comfortable\noff\" in the presence of this patriarch.\n\n\"Not that I complains o' my lot, young gemm'un,\" continued old Cripps,\npulling his forelock with one hand and pocketing the shilling with the\nother.  \"No, I says, the honest working man don't do no good\na-grumblin', but when he's got his famerly to feed,\" [old Cripps was a\nwidower, and his family consisted of the landlord of the Cockchafer],\n\"and on'y this here shillin' to do it with--\"\n\nStephen was _very_ green.  He almost cried at the sight of this\ndestitute, tottering, honest old man, and before the latter could get\nfarther in his lament another shilling was in his palsied old hand, and\nthe grey old forelock was enduring another tug.\n\nIt was well for Stephen that Mr Cripps junior turned up at this\njuncture, or the entire five shillings might have made its way into the\nold man's pouch.\n\nMr Cripps junior had the rod.  He had had a rare job, he said, to get\nit, for his friend had only yesterday had an offer of 3 pounds 15\nshillings, and was all but taking it.  However, here it was, and for\nonly 3 pounds 10 shillings tell Mr Loman; such a bargain as he wouldn't\noften make in his life, and he could get him the fly-book for a\nsovereign if he liked.  And Mr Cripps would charge him nothing for his\ntrouble.\n\nAfter this Mr Cripps junior and the boy got quite friendly.  The former\nwas greatly interested in hearing about Saint Dominic's, especially when\nhe understood Stephen was a new boy.  Cripps could remember the day when\n_he_ was a new boy, and had to fight three boys in three hours the first\nafternoon.  He was awfully fond of cricket when he was a boy.  Was\nStephen?\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Stephen; \"I like it more than anything.\"\n\n\"Ah, you should have seen the way we played.  Bless me!  I'd a bat, my\nboy, that could tip the balls clean over the school-house.  You've got a\nbat, of course, or else--\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" said Stephen.  \"I shall get one as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"Well, that _is_ lucky!  Look here, young gentleman,\" continued Cripps\nconfidentially; \"I've taken a fancy to you.  It's best to be plain and\nspeak out.  I've taken a fancy to you, and you shall have that bat.\nIt's just your size, and the finest bit of willow you ever set eyes on.\nI'll wager you'll make top score every time you use it.  You shall have\nit.  Never mind about the stumpy--\"\n\n\"Stumpy!\" ejaculated Stephen; \"I don't want stumps, only a bat.\"\n\n\"What I meant to say was, never mind about the price.  You can give me\nwhat you like for it.  I wish I could make you a present of it.  My eye,\nit's a prime bat!  Spliced!  Yes.  Treble-cane, as I'm a poor man.  I'll\nsend it up to you, see if I don't, and you can pay when you like.\"\n\nAnd so he chattered on, in a way which quite charmed Stephen, and made\nhim rejoice in his new friend, and still more at the prospect of the\nbat.\n\n\"If it's awfully dear,\" he said, at parting, with a sort of sigh, \"I\ncouldn't afford it.  My pocket-money's nearly all gone.\"\n\nHe did not say how.\n\n\"Oh, never mind, not if you don't pay at all,\" replied the genial\nCripps.  \"You'll be having more tin soon, I bet.\"\n\n\"Not till June,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Well, leave it till June--no matter.  But you may as well have the use\nof the bat now.  Good-day, Master Green--\"\n\n\"Greenfield, Stephen Greenfield,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Good-day, and give my respects to Mr Loman, and I hope I shall see you\nboth again.\"\n\nStephen hoped so too, and went off, highly elated, with Loman's rod\nunder his arm.\n\nLoman pulled rather a long face at hearing the price, and pulled a still\nlonger face when Stephen told him about the bat.  He read his fag a long\nlecture about getting into debt and pledging his pocket-money in\nadvance.\n\nThat evening Stephen was solemnly tossed up for by the Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles.  \"Heads, Guinea-pigs; tails, Tadpoles.\"  It turned up heads,\nand from that time forward Greenfield junior was a Guinea-pig.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. THE \"DOMINICAN,\" NUMBER ONE.\n\nThe eventful day had come at last.  Anthony and his confederates had\nworked hard, evening after evening, in the secrecy of their studies, and\nthe first number of the _Dominican_ was ready for publication.  The big\nframe had been smuggled in, and the big sheet was now safely lodged\nbehind the glass, with its eight broad columns of clearly-written\nmanuscript all ready to astonish Saint Dominic's.  Two nails had\nsurreptitiously been driven into the wall outside the Fifth Form room,\non which the precious document was to be suspended, and Tony only waited\nfor \"lights out\" to creep down and, with the aid of Ricketts and\nBullinger, fix it in position.  Everything succeeded well.  The secret\nhad been kept most carefully, and when, next morning, Saint Dominic's\nwoke up and swarmed down the passage past the Fifth Form class-room, the\nsight of a huge frame, with the words _The Dominican_ staring out from\nit, and several yards of writing underneath, fairly startled them.\nMaster Paul, the fag who had been deputed to the no easy task of\npreserving the structure from injury, had a hard time of it, there was\nsuch a hustling and crowding in front of it whenever classes were not\ngoing on.  The little boys squeezed in front; the bigger boys read over\ntheir heads; the Sixth examined it from the back of the crowd, and the\nFifth Form from various positions watched with complacency the effect of\nthis venture.\n\nAt first it was looked upon as a curiosity, then as a joke; then\ngradually it dawned on Saint Dominic's that it was a Fifth Form\nproduction, and finally it appeared in its true light as a school\nnewspaper.\n\nLoman, attracted by the crowd of boys, strolled down the passage to the\nplace and joined the group, just as a small boy was reading aloud the\nfollowing descriptive extract from:\n\n\"Our Special Correspondent in Guinea-pig Land.\n\n\"Last night the ceremony of admitting a new member into the ancient and\nhonourable craft of Guinea-pigs was celebrated with the usual mysteries.\nThe event took place in the fourth junior class-room.  The Guinea-pigs\nassembled in force, with blackened faces and false whiskers.  The lights\nbeing put out, Brother Bilke proposed, and Brother Smudge seconded, the\nelection of the new aspirant, and the motion being put to the\nGuinea-pigs, was received with a unanimous grunt.  The Guinea-pig elect\nwas then admitted.  He was classically attired in a pair of slippers and\na collar, and the ceremony of initiation at once commenced.  The\ncandidate was stretched across the lowest desk, face downwards, and in\nthis position greeted with the flat side of a cricket-bat by the junior\nbrother present.  He was then advanced to the next desk, where a similar\ncompliment was paid by the next youngest; and so on to the senior\nbrother present.  Half way through the ceremony the new member expressed\na desire to withdraw his candidature, but this motion was negatived by a\nlarge majority.  When our reporter left, the ceremony was being repeated\nwith the round side of the bat.  We understand the new Guinea-pig is\nkeeping his bed to-day after the exciting ceremony of initiation.\"\n\nThis was capital fun, and greatly appreciated by all--even by Stephen,\nwho knew it was intended to represent his own experience, which,\nmercifully, had not been nearly so sore as pictured.\n\nBut the next extract was not quite as pleasing.\n\n\"Cricket Notice.\n\n\"The Alphabet Match will be played on Saturday.  The following are the\ntwo elevens [and here the list followed].  Of these twenty-two players,\nit is worthy of mention that fourteen are from the Fifth, and only eight\nfrom the Sixth.  What is our Sixth coming to?\"\n\nThis was not at all gratifying to the Sixth Form fellows present.  It\nwas unfortunately true, but they did not at all fancy such prominence\nbeing given to the fact.  The next extract was still more pointed.\n\n\"Sixth Form Debating Society.\n\n\"The usual meeting of the Sixth Form Debating Society was held last\nweek, the Doctor in the chair.  A sprinkling of lads from the Fifth, in\ntheir Sunday coats and collars, was present, by kind permission.  The\nsubject for discussion was, `That the present Sixth is degenerate.'  In\nthe absence of any member of the Sixth to open the discussion, Master\nBramble, captain of the Tadpoles, kindly undertook the task.  He had no\nhesitation in asserting that the Sixth were degenerate.  They had fallen\noff in cricket since he could remember, and in intellect, he was sorry\nto say, the falling off was still worse.  If they would take his advice,\nthey would avoid the playground during the present season, and by all\nmeans withdraw their candidate for the Nightingale Scholarship, as he\nwas certain to be beaten by boys in a lower form.  As to behaviour, he\ncould point to virtuous behaviour among the Tadpoles, quite equal to\nthat of the monitors.  He didn't wish to ask questions, but would like\nto know what they all found so attractive in Maltby.  Then, too, they\nall oiled their hair.  No previous Sixth had ever been guilty of this\neffeminacy, or of wearing lavender kid gloves on Sundays.  He repeated,\n`What were we coming to?'\"\n\n\"Mr R-g-h opened in the negative.  He denied all the charges made by\nthe young gentleman who had last spoken.  He undertook to get up an\neleven to beat any eleven the Tadpoles could put into the field; and as\nto intellect, why, didn't the Tadpoles, some of them, get their sums\ndone by the Sixth?  Besides, even if their intellect was weak, couldn't\nthey use cribs?  He didn't use them himself, but he knew one or two who\ndid.  He didn't understand the objection to the hair-oil; he used it to\nmake the hair sit down on his head.  [Raleigh, it should be said, had a\nmost irrepressible bunch of curls on his head.]  He wore kid gloves on\nSunday because he had had a pair given him by his great-aunt Jane Ann.\nHe maintained the Sixth was not degenerate.\n\n\"Mr L-m-n followed on the same side.  He thought it the greatest\nliberty of any one to discuss the Sixth.  He was a Sixth Form fellow,\nand a monitor, and if he wasn't looked up to he ought to be, and he\nintended to be.  He was in the cricket eleven, and he was intellectual--\nvery, very much so.  He was going in for the Nightingale Scholarship,\nand had no doubt in his own mind as to the result.  He hardly understood\nhis friend's reference to Maltby.  Why shouldn't he go there and take\nhis fag too if he chose?  He didn't see what right the Fifth had to fags\nat all.  He had a fag, but then he was in the Sixth.  His fag admired\nhim, and he never told him not to.  The Sixth _could not_ be degenerate\nso long as _he_ was in it.\"\n\n\"Other speakers followed, including Mr W-r-n, who maintained that\nMichael Angelo was a greater musician than Queen Anne.  He was here\ncalled to order, and reminded that Michael Angelo had nothing to do with\nthe degeneracy of the Sixth.  He begged leave to explain--\n\n\"At this point our reporter fell asleep.\"\n\nThe laughter which greeted the reading of this extract was by no means\nshared by the Sixth Form boys present, who, had the next selection been\nin a similar strain, would have quitted the scene and taken their chance\nof satisfying their curiosity as to the rest of the contents of the\npaper at a more convenient season.\n\nBut the next lucubration was the unfortunate Stephen's examination\npaper, with the answers thereto embellished, and in many cases bodily\nsupplied, by the fertile Anthony.  The luckless Stephen, who was wedged\nup in the front row of readers, could have sunk into the earth on\nmeeting once more that hateful paper face to face, and feeling himself\nan object of ridicule to the whole school.  For the wonderful answers\nwhich now appeared were hardly any of them his own composition, and he\ndid not even get credit for the few correct things he had said.  Shouts\nof laughter greeted the reading, during which he dared not lift his eyes\nfrom the ground.  But the answer to Question 6, \"What is a minus?\" was\nmore than human flesh and blood could endure.\n\n\"What is a Minus?\"\n\n\"`Minus' is derived from two English words, `my,' meaning my, and `nus,'\nwhich is the London way of pronouncing `nurse.'  My nurse is a dear\ncreature; I love her still, especially now she doesn't wash my face.  I\nhated having my face washed.  My nurse's name is Mrs Blake, but I\nalways call her my own Noodle-oodle-oo.  I do love her so!  How I would\nlike to hug her!  She sewed the strings of my little flannel vest on in\nfront just before I came here because she knew I couldn't tie them\nbehind by myself--\"\n\n\"She didn't!\" shouted Stephen, in a voice trembling with indignation.\n\nPoor boy!  The laughter which greeted this simple exclamation was enough\nto finish up any one, and, with a bursting heart, and a face crimson\nwith confusion, he struggled out of the crowd and ran as fast as his\nlegs would take him to his own class-room.\n\nBut if he imagined in his misery that the whole school was going to\nspend the entire day jeering at him, and him alone, he was greatly\nmistaken, for once out of sight Stephen soon passed out of mind in\npresence of the next elegant extract read out for the benefit of the\nassembled audience.  This was no other than Simon's \"Love-Ballad.\"\n\nSimon, it should be known, was one of the dullest boys in Saint\nDominic's, and it was a standing marvel how he ever came to be in the\nFifth, for he was both a dunce and an idiot.  But he had one ambition\nand one idea, which was that he could write poetry; and the following\ntouching ballad from his pen he offered to the _Dominican_, and the\n_Dominican_ showed its appreciation of real talent by inserting it:--\n\n  \"A Love-Ballad.\n\n  \"I wish I was a buttercup,\n  Upon the mountain top,\n  That you might sweetly pick me up,\n  And sweetly let me drop.\n  I wish I was a little worm,\n  All rigling in the sun,\n  That I myself towards thee might turn\n  When thou along didst come.\n  Oh, I wish I was a doormat, sweet,\n  All prostrate on the floor,\n  If only thou wouldst wipe thy feet,\n  On me, what could I want more?\"\n\n  [\"Rigling\" is possibly \"wriggling\".]\n\nSimon, who, with true poet's instinct, was standing among the crowd\nlistening to his own poem, was somewhat perplexed by the manner in which\nhis masterpiece was received.  That every one was delighted there could\nbe no doubt.  But he had an impression he had meant the ballad to be\npathetic.  Saint Dominic's, however, had taken it up another way, and\nappeared to regard it as facetious.  At any rate his fame was made, and\nlooking as if a laurel wreath already encircled his brow, he modestly\nretired, feeling no further interest, now his own piece was ended.\n\nOliver's poem on the Tadpoles, with its marvellous rhymes, fell\ncomparatively flat after this; and Bullinger's first chapter of the\nHistory of Saint Dominic's failed to rivet the attention of the\naudience, which, however, became suddenly and painfully absorbed in the\n\"Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse,\" from the pen of Wraysford.  We must\ninflict a few passages from this document on the reader, as the paper\nwas the cause of some trouble hereafter.\n\n\"Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse.\n\n\"Monday.--Up early and took a good breakfast in one of the desks where\nthere was a jam sandwich and several toffee-drops.  The Sixth seem to\nlike jam sandwiches and toffee-drops, there are some of them in nearly\nevery desk.  The desk I was in had a packet of cigarettes in one corner.\nThey were labelled `Mild.'  I wonder why the Sixth like their\ncigarettes mild.  In the same desk were one or two books written by a\nman called Bohn; they seemed queer books, for they had Latin and Greek\nnames outside, but all the reading inside was English.  It is sad to see\nthe quarrelling that goes on in this room.  You would not suppose, to\nsee these monitors walking grandly up and down the passages striking\nterror into the hearts of all the small boys, that they could possibly\ncondescend to quarrel over the possession of an inkpot or the ownership\nof an acid-drop found among the cinders.  Alas! it is very sad.  They\ndon't seem anything like the Sixth of old days.  I shall emigrate if\nthis goes on.\n\n\"Wednesday.--A great row to-day when the Doctor was out of the room.\nThe two senior monitors engaged in a game of marbles--knuckle down--in\nthe course of which one player accused the other of cheating.  There was\nnearly a fight, only neither seemed exactly to like to begin, and both\nappeared relieved when the Doctor came in and confiscated the marbles.\"\n\nAnd so the diary went on, in a strain highly offensive to the Sixth and\nequally delighting to the lower forms.  After this the Sixth withdrew,\nnot caring to face further taunts of the kind, and leaving a free field\nto the rest of Saint Dominic's, who perused this wonderful broadside to\nthe end with unflagging interest.  Some of the advertisements with which\nTony had filled up the gaps caused considerable mirth--such as this: \"A\ngentleman about to clear out his desk, begs to give notice that he will\nSell by Auction to-morrow after `Lights out,' all those rare and\nvaluable articles, to wit:--one and a half gross best cherry-stones,\nlast year's, in excellent condition.  About twelve assorted bread\ncrusts, warranted dry and hard--one with a covering of fossilised\nsardine.  Six quires of valuable manuscript notes on various subjects,\ncomprising Latin, Greek, Mathematics, French, and Crambo.  One apple,\nwell seasoned, and embellished with a brilliant green fur of two years'\ngrowth.  And many other miscellaneous treasures, such as slate pencils,\nnutshells, an antique necktie, several defunct silkworms, a noble\nthree-bladed knife (deficient of the blades), and half a pound of putty.\nNo reserve price.  Must be cleared out at whatever sacrifice.\"\n\nAnd this was another:--\n\n\"This is to give notice, that whereas certain parties calling themselves\nGuinea-pigs have infringed on our patent rights, we, the Tadpoles of\nSaint Dominic's, have been and are from time immemorial entitled to the\nexclusive privilege of appearing in public with dirty faces, uncombed\nhair, and inky fingers.  We have also the sole right of making beasts of\nourselves on every possible occasion; and we hereby declare that it is\nour intention to institute proceedings against all parties, of whatever\nname, who shall hereafter trespass on these our inalienable rights.  By\norder, B. Smudgeface and T. Blacknose, Secretaries.\"\n\nThis final onslaught broke up the party.  The aggrieved Tadpoles rushed\nto their quarters and fumed and raged themselves into a state bordering\non, madness; and vowed revenge till they were hoarse.\n\nIt was a curious fact, nevertheless, that at prayers that evening there\nwere more clean faces among the Tadpoles than had been seen there since\nthe formation of that ancient and honourable fraternity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. A QUARREL AND A CRICKET MATCH.\n\nThe first number of the _Dominican_ had undoubtedly caused a sensation;\nand it would have created far more sensation but for the fact that the\nAlphabet Match was to be played on the following day.  But even this\ncounter-attraction could not wholly divert the mind of Saint Dominic's\nfrom this new literary marvel; and a skirmish took place on the very\nafternoon of its appearance.\n\nPembury and his friends had quite expected that the Sixth would attempt\na high-handed blow at their paper, and they were not disappointed.  For\nno sooner had Loman and his peers stalked away from the scene of their\nindignation, and found themselves in the retirement of their own room,\nthan they fell to talking in terms the reverse of pleasant about the\nevent of the morning.  The least important of their number was specially\nwroth.\n\n\"There's a great row out in the passage to-day,\" said Raleigh, who was\nblissfully ignorant of the whole matter; \"why can't some of you monitors\nkeep a little better order?  The Doctor will be wanting to know what\nit's all about!\"\n\n\"All very well,\" said Raikes, one of the monitors; \"but if the Fifth\nwill stick their tomfoolery out in the passage, there's sure to be a\nrow.\"\n\n\"What tomfoolery?  Some of you are for ever grumbling at the Fifth.\"\n\n\"And so would you if you saw the complimentary remarks they make about\nyou in this precious newspaper of theirs.\"\n\n\"Oh, the _Dominican_?  I must have a look at it by and by; but meanwhile\nsomething had better be done to stop that row, or we shall catch it\nourselves.\"\n\nAnd so saying, the captain left these injured youths to their own\ncounsels, which it is to be feared were moved more by dislike for the\n_Dominican_ than by a burning desire for the good order of the school.\n\nHowever, they must do something; and there would be nothing inconsistent\nwith their dignity in demanding the withdrawal of the obnoxious\nbroadside on account of the noise it caused.  This would be a safe move,\nand might be checkmate.  Loman was deputed to wait upon the Fifth with\nthe demand of the monitors, and lost no time in carrying out this\nwelcome task.  Class was just over, and the Fifth were just about to\nclear out of their room when Loman entered.  It was not often that a\nSixth Form fellow penetrated into their camp, and had they not guessed\nhis mission they might have resented the intrusion.\n\n\"Oh, you fellows,\" began Loman, feeling not quite so confident now as he\nhad felt five minutes ago, \"we can't have that thing of yours hanging\nout in the passage like that.  It makes a crowd--too much row.  Whose is\nit?\"\n\n\"Not mine,\" said Wraysford, laughing; \"ask Bully--perhaps it's his.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Bullinger; \"it's yours, isn't it, Simon?\"\n\n\"Only part,\" said the poet of the \"Love-Ballad\", \"and I presented that\nto the paper.\"\n\n\"Suppose it was mine?\" said Oliver, with a drawl.\n\n\"Then,\" said Loman, losing his temper, \"all I can say is, the sooner you\nclear it away the better.\"\n\n\"Oh! all right; only it's not mine.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Loman, \"I'm not going to fool about with you.  You may\nthink it all very funny, but I'll report it to the Doctor, and then\nyou'll look foolish.\"\n\n\"How nice!  So pleasant it will be to look for once like what you look\nalways,\" observed Pembury, gnawing the top of his crutch.\n\nAt that moment there was a loud shout of laughter in the passage\noutside, confirming the monitor's complaint.  Wraysford walked hastily\nto the door.\n\n\"The next time there's a row like that outside our door,\" called he to\nthe group outside, \"we'll--what do you mean by it, you young\nblackguard?\"\n\nSo saying, he caught Master Bramble, who happened to be the nearest\noffender within reach, by the collar of his coat, and lugged him bodily\ninto the class-room.\n\n\"There, now!  Do you know this gentleman?  He's a monitor.  Have a good\nlook at him.  He's been complaining of the row you are making, and quite\nrightly.  Take that, and tell all the little Pigs outside that if they\ndon't hold their noise they will find themselves, every man jack of\nthem, _mentioned by name_ in the next number!\"\n\nSo saying, with a gentle cuff he handed the ill-starred Master Bramble\nout again to his fellows, and from that time there was scarcely a sound\naudible from the passage.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Pembury, kissing his hand to Loman, who all this time\nhad been standing in the middle of the room, in a white heat, and\nperplexed what to do or say next.\n\n\"You aren't going to live here, are you?\" asked Bullinger.\n\n\"Any one got a toffee-drop?\" drily inquired Oliver.  To his surprise,\nand to the surprise of every one, Loman wheeled round towards the last\nspeaker, and without a word struck him a blow on the mouth with his\nhand.\n\nHe saw he had made a mistake, and looked ashamed the moment the deed was\ndone.  All eyes turned to Oliver, whose face was crimson with a sudden\nflush of pain and anger.  He sprang to his feet, and Braddy, the bully,\nwas already beginning to gloat over the prospect of a fight, when, to\nevery one's amazement, Oliver coolly put his hands back into his\npockets, and walking up to Loman said, quietly, \"Hadn't you better go?\"\n\nLoman stared at him in astonishment.  He had at least expected to be\nknocked down, and this, behaviour was quite incomprehensible.\n\nHe turned on his heel and quitted the room without a word; and somehow\nor other from that time the Fifth heard no more protests from the\nmonitors on the subject of the _Dominican_.\n\nBut Oliver's conduct, much as it had astonished the person chiefly\nconcerned, had astonished the Fifth still more.  For the first time in\nthe history of their class, as far as they could recollect, a blow\nstruck had not been returned, and they could not tell what to make of\nit.\n\nThe blow had been a cowardly one, and certainly unmerited, and by all\nschoolboy tradition one fairly demanding a return.  Could it be possible\ntheir man was lacking in courage?  The idea was a shock to most present,\nwho, although Oliver was never very popular among them, as has been\nsaid, had never before suspected his pluck.  In fact, it was an awkward\nmoment for all, and it was quite a relief when Simon broke silence by\nasking Oliver, \"Why didn't you knock him down, I say?\"\n\n\"Because I did not choose, if you want to know,\" replied Oliver,\nshortly.\n\n\"Oh!  I beg your pardon,\" replied Simon, rather taken aback by this\nbrusque answer.\n\nThis was not satisfactory.  Had the offender been a Guinea-pig, one\ncould have understood the thing; but when it was a Sixth Form fellow--a\ngood match in every respect, as well as a rival--the Fifth were offended\nat their man for drawing back as he had done.\n\n\"I suppose you _will_ fight him?\" said Ricketts, in a voice which\nimplied that there was no doubt about it.\n\n\"Do you?\" replied Oliver, briefly.\n\nThe boy's manner was certainly not winsome, and, when once put out, it\nwas evident he took no trouble to conceal the fact.  He refused to\nanswer any further questions on the subject, and presently quitted the\nroom, leaving more than half his class-fellows convinced that, after\nall, he _was_ a coward.\n\nAn angry discussion followed his departure.\n\n\"He ought to be made to fight, whether he likes or not,\" said Braddy the\nbully.\n\n\"Some one ought to pay Loman out,\" suggested Ricketts, \"if Greenfield\ndoesn't.\"\n\n\"A nice name we shall get, all of us,\" said Bullinger, \"when it gets\nabroad all over the school.\"\n\n\"It's a shame, because one fellow funks, for the whole Form to be\ndisgraced; that's what I say,\" said some one else.\n\nThere were, however, two boys who did not join in this general cry of\nindignation against Oliver, and they were Wraysford and Pembury.  The\nlatter was always whimsical in his opinions, and no one was surprised to\nsee him come out on the wrong side.  As for Wraysford, he always backed\nhis friend up, whether others thought him right or wrong.  These two\nscouted the idea of Oliver being a coward; the one with his usual weapon\nof ridicule, the other with all the warmth of friendship.\n\n\"Who calls him a coward?\" exclaimed Wraysford, glaring at the last\nspeaker.\n\nWraysford was not a coward, and looked so ready to avenge his friend by\nhard knocks, that the boy who had insinuated that Greenfield was afraid\nwithdrew his charge as mildly as he could.  \"I only meant, it looks as\nif he didn't like to fight,\" he said.\n\n\"And what business of yours is it what it looks like?\" demanded\nWraysford.\n\n\"Come, old man,\" said Pembury; \"don't eat him up!  I fancy Greenfield\nmight screw up courage to pull _his_ nose, whoever else he lets off, eh?\nIt's my private opinion, though, Oliver knew what he was about.\"\n\n\"Of course he did,\" sneered Braddy; \"he knew jolly well what he was\nabout.\"\n\n\"Dear me!  Is that you, Mr Braddy?  I had not noticed you here, or I\nshould not have ventured to speak on a matter having to do with pluck\nand heroism.  I'm glad you agree with me, though, although I didn't say\nhe knew _jolly_ well what he was about.  That is an expression of your\nown.\"\n\nBraddy, who as usual felt and looked extinguished when Pembury made fun\nof him, retired sulkily, and the editor of the _Dominican_ thereupon\nturned his attack on another quarter.  And so the dispute went on,\nneither party being convinced, and all satisfied only on one point--that\na cloud had arisen to mar the hitherto peaceful horizon of Fifth Form\nexistence.\n\nThe cricket match of the following day, however, served to divert the\nthoughts of all parties for a time.\n\nAs it was only the prelude to a much more important match shortly to\nfollow, I shall not attempt to describe it fully here, as the reader\nwill probably be far more interested in the incidents of Sixth versus\nSchool Match when it comes off.\n\nThe Alphabet Match was, to tell the truth, not nearly as interesting an\naffair as it promised to be, for from the very first the N's to Z's had\nthe best of it.  Stephen, who with a company of fellow-Tadpoles and\nGuinea-pigs was perched on the palings, looking on, felt his heart sink\nwithin him as first one and then another of his brother's side lost\ntheir wickets without runs.  For once he and Bramble were in sympathy,\nand he and Paul were at difference.  The row these small boys kicked up,\nby the way, was one of the most notable features of the whole match.\nEvery one of them yelled for his own side.  There had, indeed, been a\nquestion whether every Guinea-pig, whatever his private initial, ought\nnot to yell for the G's, and every Tadpole for the T's; but it was\neventually decided that each should yell \"on his own hook,\" and the\neffect was certainly far more diverting.\n\nThe first four men of the A to M went out for two runs between them, and\nStephen and Bramble sat in gloomy despair.  The next man in knocked down\nhis wicket before he had played a single ball.  It was frightful, and\nthe jeers of the Z's were hateful to hear.\n\nBut Stephen brightened as he perceived that the next batsman was his\nbrother.  \"Now they'll pick up!\" said he.\n\n\"No they won't!  Greenfield senior skies his balls too much for my\ntaste,\" cheeringly replied the small Bramble.\n\nBut Stephen was right.  For the first time that afternoon the A's made a\nstand.  Oliver's partner at the wickets was Callonby, of the Sixth, a\nsteady, plodding player, who hardly ever hit out, and got all his runs\n(if he got any) from the slips.  This afternoon he hardly scored at all,\nbut kept his wicket carefully while Oliver did the hitting.\n\nThings were looking up.  The telegraph went up from 2 to 20.  Wraysford,\nwho had hitherto been bowling with Ricketts against his friend, gave up\nthe ball to Raikes, and the field generally woke up to the importance of\ngetting rid of this daring player.\n\nStephen's throat was too hoarse to roar any more, so he resigned that\nduty to Bramble, and looked on in delighted silence.  The score crept\nup, till suddenly Callonby tipped a ball into cover-slip's hand and was\ncaught, to the great delight of the Z's, who guessed that, once a\nseparation had been effected, the survivor would soon be disposed of.\n\nThe next man in was Loman.  He was better as a bowler than a batsman;\nbut he followed Callonby's tactics and played a steady block, leaving\nthe boy he had struck yesterday to do the hitting.\n\nOliver was certainly playing in fine form, and for a moment his\nclass-fellows forgot their resentment against him in applauding his\nplay.  The score was at 35, and the new coalition promised to be as\nformidable as the last, when Oliver cut a ball past point.\n\n\"Run! no! yes, run!\" he shouted.  Loman started, then hesitated, then\nstarted again--but it was too late.  Before he could get across, the\nball was up and he was run out.  He was furious, and it certainly was\nhard lines for him, although there would have been time enough for the\nrun had he not pulled up in the middle.  Forgetful of all the rules of\ncricket, he turned round to Oliver and shouted, \"You are a fool!\" as he\nleft the wicket.\n\nStephen luckily was too much engrossed in watching the telegraph to hear\nor notice this remark; which, however, was not lost on the Fifth\ngenerally, who experienced a return of their former discontent when they\nobserved that Oliver (though he must have heard it) took not the\nslightest notice of the offensive expression.\n\nThe match passed off without further incident.  The Z's won in the end\nby two wickets, after a closer match than it had promised to be at\nfirst, and Stephen was comforted for the reverse by feeling sure that\nhis brother at any rate had played his best, and would certainly get his\nplace in the School Eleven.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. A ROD IN PICKLE.\n\nLoman, who had arrived at the same conclusion respecting Oliver's\nbravery as the majority in the Fifth, did not allow his conscience to\ntrouble him as to his share of the morning's business.  He never had\nliked Oliver, and lately especially he had come to dislike him.  He was\ntherefore glad to have made him smart; and now, since the blunder in the\ncricket match, he felt greatly inclined to repeat the blow, particularly\nas there did not seem much to fear if he did so.\n\nHe was quick, too, to see that Oliver had lost favour with his comrades,\nand had no hesitation in availing himself of every opportunity of\nwidening the breach.  He affected to be sorry for the poor fellow, and\nto feel that he had been too hard on him, and so on, in a manner which,\nwhile it offended the Fifth, as applied to one of their set, exasperated\nthem all the more against Oliver.  And so matters went on, getting more\nand more unsatisfactory.\n\nLoman, however, had other things to think of than his rival's cowardice,\nand foremost among these was his new fishing-rod--or rather, the rod\nwhich he coveted for his own.  Until the day after the Alphabet Match he\nhad not even had time to examine his treasure.  Three pounds ten was an\nappalling figure to pay for a rod; \"But then,\" thought Loman, \"if it's\nreally a good one, and worth half as much again, it would be a pity to\nmiss such a bargain;\" and every one knew the Crippses, father and son,\nwere authorities on all matters pertaining to the piscatorial art.\nLoman, too, was never badly off for pocket-money, and could easily raise\nthe amount, he felt sure, when he represented the case at home.  So he\ntook the rod out of its canvas bag, and began to put it together.\n\nNow, a boy's study is hardly the place in which to flourish a\nfishing-rod, and Loman found that with the butt down in one bottom\ncorner of the room, the top joint would have to be put on up in the\nopposite top corner.  When this complicated operation was over, there\nwas no room to move it from its position, still less to judge of its\nweight and spring, or attach the winch and line.  Happy thought! the\nwindow!  He would have any amount of scope there.  So, taking it to\npieces, and putting it together again in this new direction, he had the\nsatisfaction of testing it at its full length.  He was pleased with the\nrod, on the whole.  He attached the line, with a fly at the end, in\norder to give it a thorough trial, and gave a scientific \"cast\" into an\nimaginary pool.  It was a splendid rod, just right for him; how he\nwished he was up above Gusset Weir at that moment!  Why, he could--\n\nHere he attempted to draw up the rod.  There was an ugly tug and a crack\nas he did so, and he found, to his disgust, that the hook, having\nnothing else to catch, had caught the ivy on the wall, and, what was\nworse, that the top joint of the rod had either snapped or cracked in\nits inability to bring this weighty catch to shore.  It was a long time\nbefore Loman was able to disengage his line, and bring the rod in again\nat the window.  The top joint was cracked.  It looked all right as he\nheld it, but when he tried to bend it it had lost its spring, and the\ncrack showed only too plainly.  Another misfortune still was in store.\nThe reel in winding up suddenly stuck.  Loman, fancying it had only\ncaught temporarily, tried to force it, and in so doing the spring broke,\nand the handle turned uselessly round and round in his hand.  This _was_\na streak of bad luck, and no mistake!  The rod was not his, and what was\nworse, it was (so Cripps said) a rod of extraordinary excellence and\nvalue.  Loman had his doubts now about this.  A first-rate top-piece\nwould bend nearly double and then not break, and a reel that broke at\nthe least pressure could hardly be of the best kind.  Still, Cripps\nthought a lot of it, and Loman had undoubtedly himself alone to blame\nfor the accidents which had occurred.  As it was, the rod was now\nuseless.  He knew there was no place in Maltby where he could get it\nrepaired, and it was hardly to be expected that Cripps would take it\nback.\n\nWhat was to be done?  Either he must pay 3 pounds 10 shillings for a rod\nof no value, or--\n\nHe slowly took the rod to pieces and put it back into the canvas bag.\nThe top joint after all did not look amiss; and, yes, there was a\n_little_ bit of elasticity in it.  Perhaps the crack was only his fancy;\nor perhaps the crack was there when he got it.  As to the reel, it\nlooked as if it _ought_ to work, and perhaps it would if he only knew\nthe way.  Ah! suppose he just sent the rod back to Cripps with a message\nthat he found he did not require it?  He would not say he had not used\nit, but if Cripps chose to imagine he received it back just as he sent\nit, well, what harm?  Cripps would be sure to sell it to some one else,\nor else put it by (he had said he possessed a rod of his own).  If he,\nLoman, had felt quite certain that he had damaged the rod himself, of\ncourse he would not think of such a thing; but he was not at all certain\nthe thing was not defective to begin with.  In any case it was an\ninferior rod--that he had no doubt about--and Cripps was not acting\nhonestly by trying to pass it off on him as one of the best make.  Yes,\nit would serve Cripps right, and be a lesson to him, and he was sure,\nyes, quite sure now, it had been damaged to begin with.\n\nAnd so the boy argued with himself and coquetted with the tempter.\nBefore the afternoon was over he felt (as he imagined) quite comfortable\nin his own mind over the affair.  The rod was tied up again in its bag\nexactly as it had been before, and only wanted an opportunity to be\nreturned to Mr Cripps.\n\nAfter that Loman settled down to an evening's study.  But things were\nagainst him again.  Comfortable as his conscience was, that top joint\nwould not let him alone.  It seemed to get into his hand in place of the\npen, and to point out the words in the lexicon in place of his finger.\nHe tried not to mind it, but it annoyed him, and, what was worse,\ninterfered with his work.  So, shutting up his books, and imagining a\nchange of air might be beneficial, he went off to Callonby's study,\nthere to gossip for an hour or two, and finally rid himself of his\ntormentor.\n\nStephen, meanwhile, had had Mr Cripps on his mind too, for that\nafternoon his bat had come home.  It was addressed to \"Mr Greenfield,\nSaint Dominic's,\" and of course taken to Oliver, who wondered much to\nreceive a small size cricket-bat in a parcel.  Master Paul, however, who\nwas in attendance, was able to clear up the mystery.\n\n\"Oh! that's your young brother's, I expect; he said he had got a bat\ncoming.\"\n\n\"All I can say is, he must be more flush of cash than I am, to go in for\na thing like this.  Send him here, Paul.\"\n\nSo Paul vanished, and presently Stephen put in an appearance, blushing,\nand anxious-looking.\n\n\"Is this yours?\" asked the elder brother.\n\n\"Yes; did Mr Cripps send it?\"\n\n\"Mr Cripps the lock-keeper?\"\n\n\"No, his son.  He said he would get it for me.  I say, is that a good\nbat, Oliver?\"\n\n\"Nothing out of the way.  But, I say, young 'un, how much have you given\nfor it?\"\n\n\"Not anything yet.  Mr Cripps said I could pay in June, when I get my\nnext pocket-money.\"\n\n\"What on earth has he to do with when you get your pocket-money?\"\ndemanded Oliver.  \"Who is this young Cripps?  He's a cad, isn't he?\"\n\n\"He seemed a very nice man,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Well, look here! the less you have to do with men like him the better.\nWhat is the price of the bat?\"\n\n\"I don't know; it's one Mr Cripps had himself when he was a boy.  He\nsays it's a beauty!  I say, it looks as good as new, Oliver.\"\n\n\"You young muff!\" said the elder brother; \"I expect the fellow's\nswindling you.  Find out what he wants for it at once, and pay him; I'm\nnot going to let you run into debt.\"\n\n\"But I can't; I've only two shillings left,\" said Stephen, dejectedly.\n\n\"Why, whatever have you done with the five shillings you had last week?\"\n\nStephen blushed, and then faltered, \"I spent sixpence on stamps and\nsixpence on--on brandy-balls!\"\n\n\"I thought so.  And what did you do with the rest?\"\n\n\"Oh!  I--I--that is--I--gave them away.\"\n\n\"Gave them away!  Who to--to Bramble?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Stephen, laughing at the idea; \"I gave them to a poor old\nman!\"\n\n\"Where?--when?  Upon my word, Stephen, you _are_ a jackass--who to?\"\n\nAnd then Stephen confessed, and the elder brother rated him soundly for\nhis folly, till the little fellow felt quite miserable and ashamed of\nhimself.  In the end, Oliver insisted on Stephen finding out at once\nwhat the price of the bat was, and promised he would lend his brother\nthe money for it.  In return for this, Stephen promised to make no more\npurchases of this kind without first consulting Oliver, and at this\njuncture Wraysford turned up, and Stephen beat a retreat with his bat\nover his shoulder.\n\nThe two friends had not been alone together since _the fracas_ in the\nFifth two days before, and both now appeared glad of an opportunity of\ntalking over that and subsequent events.\n\n\"I suppose you know a lot of the fellows are very sore at you for not\nthrashing Loman?\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"I guessed they would be.  Are you riled, too, Wray?\"\n\n\"Not I!  I know what _I_ should have done myself, but I suppose you know\nyour own business best.\"\n\n\"I was greatly tempted to let out,\" said Oliver, \"but the fact is--I\nknow you'll jeer, Wray--the fact is, I've been trying feebly to turn\nover a new leaf this term.\"\n\nWraysford said \"Oh!\" and looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"And one of the things I wanted to keep out of was losing my temper,\nwhich you know is not a good one.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Wraysford, meaning quite the opposite to what he\nsaid.\n\n\"Well, if you'll believe me, I've lost my temper oftener in trying to\nkeep this resolution than I ever remember to have done before.  But on\nFriday it came over me just as I was going to thrash Loman.  That's why\nI didn't.\"\n\nWraysford looked greatly relieved when this confession was over.  \"You\nare a rum fellow, Noll,\" said he, after a pause, \"and of course it is\nall right; but the fellows don't know your reason, and think you showed\nthe white feather.\"\n\n\"Let them think!\" shouted Oliver, in a voice so loud and angry that\nMaster Paul came to the door and asked what he wanted.\n\n\"What do I care what they think?\" continued Oliver, forgetting all about\nhis temper; \"they can think what they like, but they had better let me\nalone.  I'd like to knock all their heads together! so I would!\"\n\n\"Steady, old man!\" said Wraysford, good-humouredly; \"I quite agree with\nyou.  But I say, Noll, I think it's a pity you don't put yourself right\nwith them and the school generally, somehow.  Everybody heard Loman call\nyou a fool yesterday, and you know our fellows are so clannish that they\nthink, for the credit of the Fifth, something ought to be done.\"\n\n\"Let them send Braddy to thrash him, then; I don't intend to fight to\nplease _them_!\"\n\n\"Oh! that's all right.  And if they all knew what you've told me they\nwould understand it; but as it is, they don't.\"\n\n\"They'll find out some day, most likely,\" growled Oliver; \"I'm not going\nto bother any more about it.  I say, Wray, do you know anything of\nCripps's son?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Don't you know he keeps a dirty public-house in Maltby?--a\nregular cad, they say.  The fishing-fellows have seen him up at the Weir\nnow and then.\"\n\n\"I don't know how he came across him, but my young brother has just been\nbuying a bat from him, and I don't much fancy it.\"\n\n\"No, the youngster won't get any good with that fellow; you had better\ntell him,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"So I have, and he won't do it again.\"\n\nShortly after this Pembury hobbled in on his way to bed.\n\n\"You're a pretty fellow,\" said he to Oliver; \"not one of our fellows\ncares a rush about the _Dominican_ since you made yourself into the\nlatest sensation.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't let us have that up again,\" implored Oliver.\n\n\"All very well, but what is to become of the _Dominican_?\"\n\n\"Oh, have a special extra number about me.  Call me a coward, and a\nfool, and a Tadpole, any mortal thing you like, only shut up about the\naffair now!\"\n\nPembury looked concerned.\n\n\"Allow me to feel your pulse,\" said he to Oliver.\n\n\"Feel away,\" said Oliver, glad of any diversion.\n\n\"Hum!  As I feared--feverish.  Oliver, my boy, you are not well.\nWandering a bit in your mind, too; get to bed.  Be better soon.  Able to\ntalk like an ordinary rational animal then, and not like an animated\ntom-cat.  Good-bye!\"\n\nAnd so saying he departed, leaving the friends too much amused to be\nangry at his rudeness.\n\nThe two friends did a steady evening's work after this, and the thought\nof the Nightingale Scholarship drove away for the time all less pleasant\nrecollections.\n\nThey slept, after it all, far more soundly than Loman, whose dreams were\ndisturbed by that everlasting top joint all the night long.\n\nThe reader will no doubt have already decided in his own mind whether\nOliver Greenfield did rightly or wrongly in putting his hands into his\npockets instead of using them to knock down Loman.  It certainly did not\nseem to have done him much good at the time.  He had lost the esteem of\nhis comrades, he had lost the very temper he had been trying to keep--\ntwenty times since the event--and no one gave him credit for anything\nbut \"the better part of valour\" in the whole affair.\n\nAnd yet that one effort of self-restraint was not altogether an unmanly\nact.  At least, so thought Wraysford that night, as he lay meditating\nupon his friend's troubles, and found himself liking him none the less\nfor this latest singular piece of eccentricity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. THE FOURTH JUNIOR AT HOME.\n\nStephen, before he had been a fortnight in the school, found himself\nvery much at home at Saint Dominic's.  He was not one of those\nexuberant, irrepressible boys who take their class-fellows by storm, and\nrise to the top of the tree almost as soon as they touch the bottom.\nStephen, as the reader knows, was not a very clever boy, or a very\ndashing boy, and yet he somehow managed to get his footing among his\ncomrades in the Fourth Junior, and particularly among his fellow\nGuinea-pigs.\n\nHe had fought Master Bramble six times in three days during his second\nweek, and was engaged to fight him again every Tuesday, Thursday, and\nFriday during the term.  He had also taken the chair at one indignation\nmeeting against the monitors, and spoken in favour of a resolution at\nanother.  He had distributed brandy-balls in a most handsome manner to\nhis particular adherents, and he had been the means of carrying away no\nless than two blankets from the next dormitory.  This was pretty good\nfor a fortnight.  Add to this that he had remained steadily at the\nbottom of his class during the entire period, and that once he had\nreceived an \"impot\" (or imposition) from Mr Rastle, and it will easily\nbe understood that he soon gained favour among his fellows.\n\nThis last cause of celebrity, however, was one which did not please\nStephen.  He had come to Saint Dominic's with a great quantity of good\nresolutions, the chief of which was that he would work hard and keep out\nof mischief, and it grieved him much to find that in neither aim was he\nsucceeding.\n\nThe first evening or two he had worked very diligently at preparation.\nHe had taken pains with his fractions, and looked out every word in his\nCaesar.  He had got Oliver to look over his French, and Loman had\nvolunteered to correct the spelling of his \"theme;\" and yet he stuck at\nthe bottom of the class.  Other boys went up and down.  Some openly\nboasted that they had had their lessons done for them, and others that\nthey had not done them at all.  A merry time they had of it; but\nStephen, down at the bottom, was in dismal dumps.  He could not get up,\nand he could not get down, and all his honest hard work went for\nnothing.\n\nAnd so, not content to give that system a longer trial, he grew more lax\nin his work.  He filched the answers to his sums out of the \"Key,\" and\ncopied his Caesar out of the \"crib.\"  It was much easier, and the result\nwas the same.  He did not get up, and he could not get down.\n\nOliver catechised him now and then as to his progress, and received\nvague answers in reply, and Loman never remembered a fag that pestered\nhim less with lessons.  Stephen was, in fact, settling down into the\nslough of idleness, and would have become an accomplished dunce in time,\nhad not Mr Rastle come to the rescue.  That gentleman caught the new\nboy in an idle mood, wandering aimlessly down the passage one afternoon.\n\n\"Ah, Greenfield, is that you?  Nothing to do, eh?  Come and have tea\nwith me, will you, in my room?\"\n\nStephen, who had bounded as if shot on hearing the master's unexpected\nvoice behind him, turned round and blushed very red, and said \"Thank\nyou,\" and then looked like a criminal just summoned to the gallows.\n\n\"That's right, come along;\" and the master took the lad by the arm and\nmarched him off to his room.\n\nHere the sight of muffins and red-currant jam, in addition to the\nordinary attractions of a tea-table, somewhat revived Stephen's drooping\nspirits.\n\n\"Make yourself comfortable, my boy, while the tea is brewing,\" said Mr\nRastle, cheerily.  \"Have you been playing any cricket since you came?\"\n\n\"Only a little, sir,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Well, if you only turn out as good a bat as your brother--how well he\nplayed in the Alphabet Match!\"\n\nStephen was reviving fast now, and embarked on a lively chat about his\nfavourite sport, by the end of which the tea was brewed, and he and Mr\nRastle sitting \"cheek by jowl\" at the table, with the muffins and jam\nbetween them.\n\nPresently Mr Rastle steered the talk round to Stephen's home, a topic\neven more delightful than cricket.  The boy launched out into a full\naccount of the old house and his mother, till the tears very nearly\nstood in his eyes and the muffins very nearly stuck in his throat.  Mr\nRastle listened to it all with a sympathetic smile, throwing in\nquestions now and then which it charmed the boy to answer.\n\n\"And how do you like Saint Dominic's?\" presently inquired the master.\n\"I suppose you've made plenty of friends by this time?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir.  It's not as slow as it was at first.\"\n\n\"That's right.  You'll soon get to feel at home.  And how do you think\nyou are getting on in class?\"\n\nStephen was astonished at this question.  If any one knew how he was\ngetting on in class Mr Rastle did, and, alas!  Mr Rastle must know\nwell enough that Stephen was getting on badly.\n\n\"Not very well, I'm afraid, sir, thank you,\" replied the boy, not\nfeeling exactly comfortable.\n\n\"Not?  That's a pity.  Are the lessons too hard for you?\" kindly\ninquired Mr Rastle.\n\n\"No, I don't think so--that is--no, they're not, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, your Latin exercise I thought was very fair in parts to-day.\"\n\nStephen stared at his master, and the master looked very pleasantly at\nStephen.\n\n\"I copied it off Raddleston,\" said the boy, in a trembling voice, and\nmentally resigning himself to his fate.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr Rastle, laughing; \"it's a funny thing, now, Greenfield, I\nknew that myself.  No two boys could possibly have translated `nobody'\ninto `_nullus corpus_' without making common cause!\"\n\nStephen was desperately perplexed.  He had expected a regular row on the\nhead of his confession, and here was his master cracking jokes about the\naffair!\n\n\"I'm very sorry I did it.  I won't do it again,\" said he.  \"That's\nright, my boy; Raddleston isn't infallible.  Much better do it yourself.\nI venture to say, now, you can tell me what the Latin for `nobody' is\nwithout a dictionary.\"\n\n\"_Nemo_,\" promptly replied Stephen.\n\n\"Of course! and therefore if you had done the exercise yourself you\nwouldn't have made that horrid--that fearful mistake!\"\n\nStephen said, \"Yes, sir,\" and meditated.\n\n\"Come now,\" said Mr Rastle, cheerily, \"I'm not going to scold you.  But\nif you take my advice you will try and do the next exercise by yourself.\nOf course you can't expect to be perfect all at once, but if you always\ncopy off Raddleston, do you see, you'll _never_ get on at all.\"\n\n\"I'll try, sir,\" said Stephen, meaning what he said.\n\n\"I know you will, my boy.  It's not easy work to begin with, but it's\neasier far in the long run.  Try, and if you have difficulties, as you\nare sure to have, come to me.  I'm always here in the evenings, and\nwe'll hammer it out between us.  School will not be without its\ntemptations, and you will find it hard always to do your duty.  Yet you\nhave, I hope, learnt the power of prayer; and surely the Saviour is able\nnot only to forgive us our sins, but also to keep us from falling.  At\nschool, my boy, as elsewhere, it is a safe rule, whenever one is in\ndoubt, to avoid everything, no matter who may be the tempter, of which\none cannot fearlessly speak to one's father or mother, and above all to\nour Heavenly Father.  Don't be afraid of Him--He will always be ready to\nhelp you and to guide you with His Holy Spirit.  Have another cup of\ntea?\"\n\nThis little talk, much as he missed at the time its deeper meaning,\nsaved Stephen from becoming a dunce.  He still blundered and boggled\nover his lessons, and still kept pretty near to the bottom form in his\nclass, but he felt that his master had an interest in him, and that\nacted like magic to his soul.  He declined Master Raddleston's\nprofessional assistance for the future, and did the best he could by\nhimself.  He now and then, though hesitatingly, availed himself of Mr\nRastle's offer, and took his difficulties to head-quarters; and he\nalways, when he did so, found the master ready and glad to help, and not\nonly that, but to explain as he went along, and clear the way of future\nobstacles of the same sort.\n\nAnd so things looked up with Stephen.  He wrote jubilant letters home;\nhe experienced all the joys of an easy conscience, and he felt that he\nhad a friend at court.\n\nBut as long as he was a member of the honourable fraternity of\nGuinea-pigs, Stephen Greenfield was not likely to be dull at Saint\nDominic's.\n\nThe politics of the lower school were rather intricate.  The Guinea-pigs\nwere not exactly the enemies of the Tadpoles, but the rivals.  They were\nalways jangling among themselves, it was true; and when Stephen, for the\nsecond time in one week, had hit Bramble in the eye, there was such\njubilation among the Guinea-pigs that any one might have supposed the\ntwo clans were at daggers drawn.  But it was not so--at least, not\nalways--for though they fell out among themselves, they united their\nforces against the common enemy--the monitors!\n\nMonitors, in the opinion of these young republicans, were an invention\nof the Evil One, invented for the sole purpose of interfering with them.\nBut for the monitors they could carry out their long-cherished scheme\nof a pitched battle on the big staircase, for asserting their right to\ngo down the left side, when they chose, and up on the right.  As it was,\nthe monitors insisted that they should go up on the left and come down\non the right.  It was intolerable tyranny!  And but for the monitors\ntheir comb-and-paper musical society might give daily recitals in the\ntop corridor and so delight all Saint Dominic's.  What right had the\nmonitors to forbid the performance and confiscate the combs?  Was it to\nbe endured?  And but for the monitors, once more, they might perfect\nthemselves in the art of pea-shooting.  Was such a thing ever heard of,\nas that fellows should be compelled to shoot peas at the wall in the\nprivacy of their own studies, instead of at one another in the passages?\nIt was a shame--it was a scandal--it was a crime!\n\nOn burning questions such as these, Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles sunk all\npetty differences, and thought and felt as one man; and not the least\nardent among them was Stephen.\n\n\"Come on, quick!  Greenfield junior,\" squeaked the voice of Bramble, one\nafternoon, as he and Stephen met on the staircase.\n\nStephen had fought Bramble yesterday at four o'clock, and was to fight\nhim again to-morrow at half-past twelve, but at the call of common\ndanger he forgot the feud and tore up the stairs, two steps at a time,\nbeside his chronic enemy.\n\n\"What's the row?\" he gasped, as they flew along.\n\n\"Row?  Why, what do you think?  Young Bellerby has been doctored for\ntying a string across the passage!\"\n\n\"Had up before the Doctor?  My eye, Bramble!\"\n\n\"It is your eye indeed!  One of the monitors tripped over it, and got in\na rage, and there's Bellerby now catching it in the Black Hole.  Come on\nto the meeting; quick!\"\n\nThe two rushed on, joined by one and another of their fellows who had\nheard the terrible news.  The party rushed pellmell into the Fourth\nJunior class-room, where were already assembled a score or more youths,\nshouting, and stamping, and howling like madmen.  At the sight of\nBramble, the acknowledged leader of all malcontents, they quieted down\nfor a moment to hear what he had to say.\n\n\"Here's a go!\" classically began that hero.\n\nAt this the clamour, swelled twofold by the new additions, rose louder\nthan ever.  It _was_ a go!\n\n\"I wish it had been _me_!\" again yelled Bramble; \"I have let them know.\"\n\nOnce more the shouts rose high and loud in approval of this noble\nsentiment.\n\n\"_I'd_ have kicked their legs!\" once more howled Bramble, as soon as he\ncould make himself heard.\n\n\"So would we; kicked their legs!\"\n\n\"They ought to be hanged!\" screamed Bramble.\n\n\"_I'll_ not fag any more for Wren!\" bellowed Bramble.\n\n\"I'll not fag any more for Greenfield senior!\" thundered Paul.\n\n\"I'll not fag any more for Loman!\" shrieked Stephen.\n\n\"Why don't some of you put poison in their teas?\" cried one.\n\n\"Or blow them up when they're in bed with gunpowder?\"\n\n\"Or flay them alive?\"\n\n\"Or boil them in tar?\"\n\n\"Or throw them into the lions' den?\"\n\n\"Those who say we won't stand it any longer,\" shouted Bramble, jumping\nup on to a form, \"hold up your hands!\"\n\nA perfect forest of inky hands arose, and a shout with them that almost\nshook the ceiling.\n\nAt that moment the door opened, and Wren appeared.  The effect was\nmagical; every one became suddenly quiet, and looked another way.\n\n\"The next time there's a noise like that,\" said the monitor, \"the whole\nclass will be detained one hour,\" and, so saying, departed.\n\nAfter that the indignation meeting was kept up in whispers.  Now and\nthen the feelings of the assembly broke out into words, but the noise\nwas instantly checked.\n\n\"If young Bellerby has been flogged,\" said Bramble, in a most sepulchral\nundertone, \"I've a good mind to fight every one of them!\"\n\n\"Yes, every one of them,\" whispered the multitude.\n\n\"They're all as bad as each other!\" gasped Bramble.\n\n\"_We'll_ let them know,\" muttered the audience.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I've a good mind to--to--ur--ur--I've a good mind\nto--ugh!\"\n\nAgain the door opened.  This time it was Callonby.\n\n\"Where's young Raddleston?--What _are_ you young beggars up to?--is\nRaddleston here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" mildly answered the voice of Master Raddleston, who a moment ago\nhad nearly broken a blood-vessel in his endeavours to scream in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Come here, then.\"\n\nThe fag meekly obeyed.\n\n\"Oh, and Greenfield junior,\" said Callonby, as he was turning to depart,\n\"Loman wants to know when you are going to get his tea; you're to go at\nonce, he says.\"\n\nStephen obeyed, and was very humble in explaining to Loman that he had\nforgotten (which was the case) the time.  The meeting in the Fourth\nclass-room lasted most of the afternoon; but as oratory in whispers is\ntedious, and constant repetition of the same sentiments, however\npatriotic, is monotonous, it flagged considerably in spirit towards the\nend, and degenerated into one of the usual wrangles between Guinea-pigs\nand Tadpoles, in the midst of which Master Bramble left the chair, and\nwent off in the meekest manner possible to get Wren to help him with his\nsums for next day.\n\nStephen meanwhile was engaged in doing a little piece of business for\nLoman, of which more must be said in a following chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. IN THE TOILS.\n\nThe afternoon of the famous \"indignation meeting\" in the Fourth Junior\nwas the afternoon of the week which Mr Cripps the younger, putting\naside for a season the anxieties and responsibilities of his \"public\"\nduties in Maltby, usually devoted to the pursuit of the \"gentle craft,\"\nat his worthy father's cottage by Gusset Weir.  Loman, who was aware of\nthis circumstance, and on whose spirit that restless top joint had\ncontinued to prey ever since the evening of the misadventure a week ago,\ndetermined to avail himself of the opportunity of returning the unlucky\nfishing-rod into the hands from which he had received it.\n\nHe therefore instructed Stephen to take it up to the lock-house with a\nnote to the effect that having changed his mind in the matter since\nspeaking to Cripps, he found he should not require the rod, and\ntherefore returned it, with many thanks for Mr Cripps's trouble.\n\nStephen, little suspecting the questionable nature of his errand,\nundertook the commission, and duly delivered both rod and letter into\nthe hands of Mr Cripps, who greatly astonished him by swearing very\nviolently at the contents of the letter.  \"Well,\" said he, when he had\nexhausted his vocabulary (not a small one) of expletives--\"well, of all\nthe grinning jackanapeses, this is the coolest go!  Do you take me for a\nfool?\"\n\nStephen, to whom this question appeared to be directly applied,\ndisclaimed any idea of the kind, and added, \"I don't know what you\nmean.\"\n\n\"Don't you, my young master?  All right!  Tell Mr Loman I'll wait upon\nhim one fine day, see if I don't!  Here's me, given up a whole blessed\nday to serve him, and a pot of money out of my pocket, and here he goes!\nnot a penny for my pains!  Chucks the thing back on my 'ands as cool as\na coocumber, all because he's changed his mind.  I'll let him have a bit\nof my mind, tell him, Mr Gentleman Schoolboy, see if I don't.  I ain't\na-going to be robbed, no! not by all the blessed monkeys that ever wrote\non slates!  _I'll_ wait upon him, see if I don't!\"\n\nStephen, to whom the whole of this oration, which was garnished with\nwords that we can hardly set down in print, or degrade ourselves by\nsuggesting, was about as intelligible as if it had been Hebrew, thought\nit better to make no reply, and sorrowed inwardly to find that such a\nnice man as Mr Cripps should possess so short a temper.  But the\nlandlord of the Cockchafer soon recovered from his temporary annoyance,\nand even proceeded to apologise to Stephen for the warmth of his\nlanguage.\n\n\"You'll excuse me, young gentleman,\" said he, \"but I'm a plain-spoken\nman, and I was--there, I won't deny it--I was a bit put out about this\nhere rod first go off.  You'll excuse me--of course I don't mean no\noffence to you or Mister Loman neither, who's one of the nicest young\ngentlemen I ever met.  Of course if you'd a' paid seventy bob out of\nyour own pocket it would give _you_ a turn; leastways, if you was a\nstruggling, honest working man, like me.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" snivelled, old Mr Cripps, who had entered during this last\nspeech; \"that's it, Benny, my boy, honest Partisans, that's what we is,\nwho knows what it are to be in want of a shillin' to buy a clo' or two\nfor the little childer.\"\n\nWhat particular little \"childer\" Mr Cripps senior and his son were\nspecially interested in no one knew, for neither of them was blessed\nwith any.  However, it was one of old Mr Cripps's heart-moving phrases,\nand no one was rude enough to ask questions.\n\nStephen did not, on the present occasion, feel moved to respond to the\nold man's lament, and Cripps junior, with more adroitness than filial\naffection, hustled the old gentleman out of the door.\n\n\"Never mind him,\" said he to Stephen.  \"He's a silly old man, and always\npretends he's starvin'.  If you believe me, he's a thousand pounds\nstowed away somewheres.  I on'y wish,\" added he, with a sigh, \"he'd give\nme a taste of it, for its 'ard, up-'ill work makin' ends meet,\nparticular when a man's deceived by parties.  No matter.  I'll pull\nthrough; you see!\"\n\nStephen once more did not feel called upon to pursue this line of\nconversation, and therefore changed the subject.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Cripps, how much is that bat?\"\n\n\"Bat!  Bless me if I hadn't nearly forgot all about it.  Ain't it a\nbeauty, now?\"\n\n\"Yes, pretty well,\" said Stephen, whose friends had one and all abused\nthe bat, and who was himself a little disappointed in his expectations.\n\n\"Pretty well!  I like that.  You must be a funny cricketer, young\ngentleman, to call that bat only pretty well.  I suppose you want me to\ntake _that_ back, too?\" and here Mr Cripps looked very fierce.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Stephen, hurriedly.  \"I only want to know what I am to\npay for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, we needn't mind about that.  That'll keep, you know.  As\nif I wanted the money.  Ha, ha!\"\n\nEven a green boy like Stephen could not fail to wonder why, if Mr\nCripps was as hard up as he had just described himself, he should now be\nso anxious to represent himself as not in want of money.\n\n\"Please, I want to know the price.\"\n\n\"As if I was a-going to name prices to a young gentleman like you!\nPlease yourself about it.  I shall not be disappointed if you gives me\nonly eighteenpence, and if _you_ thinks twelve bob is handsome, well,\nlet it be.  _I_ can struggle on somehow.\"\n\nThis was uncomfortable for Stephen, who, too green, fortunately, to\ncomprehend the drift of Mr Cripps's gentle hints, again asked that he\nwould name a price.\n\nThis time Mr Cripps answered more precisely.\n\n\"Well, that there bat is worth a guinea, if you want to know, but I'll\nsay a sovereign for cash down.\"\n\nStephen whistled a long-drawn whistle of dismay.\n\n\"A sovereign!  I can't pay all that!  I thought it would be about seven\nshillings!\"\n\n\"Did you?  You may think what you like, but that's my price, and you are\nlucky to get it at that.\"\n\n\"I shall have to send it back.  I can't afford so much,\" said Stephen,\ndespondingly.\n\n\"Not if I know it!  I'll have none of your second-hand bats, if I know\nit.  Come, young gentleman, I may be a poor man, but I'm not a fool, and\nyou'll find it out if I've any of your nonsense.  Do you suppose I've\nnothing to do but wait on jackanapeses like you and your mates?  No\nerror!  There you are.  That'll do, and if you don't like it--well, the\ngovernor shall know about it!\"\n\nStephen was dreadfully uncomfortable.  Though, to his knowledge, he had\ndone nothing wrong, he felt terribly guilty at the bare notion of the\nDoctor being informed of his transactions with Mr Cripps, besides\ngreatly in awe of the vague threats held out by that gentleman.  He did\nnot venture on further argument, but, bidding a hasty farewell, returned\nas fast as he could to Saint Dominic's, wondering whatever Oliver would\nsay, and sorely repenting the day when first he was tempted to think of\nthe unlucky bat.\n\nHe made a clean breast of it to his brother that evening, who, of\ncourse, called him an ass, and everything else complimentary, and was\ndeservedly angry.  However, Stephen had reason to consider himself lucky\nto possess an elder brother at the school who had a little more\nshrewdness than himself.  Oliver was determined the debt should be paid\nat once, without even waiting to write home, and by borrowing ten\nshillings from Wraysford, and adding to it the residue of his own\npocket-money, the sovereign was raised and dispatched that very night to\nMr Cripps; after which Oliver commanded his brother to sit down and\nwrite a full confession of his folly home, and ask for the money,\npromising never to make such a fool of himself again.  This task the\nsmall boy, with much shame and trembling at heart, accomplished; and in\ndue time an answer came from his mother which not only relieved his mind\nbut paid off his debts to Oliver and Wraysford, and once for all closed\nthe business of the treble-cane splice bat.\n\nIt would have been well for Loman if he could have got out of his\ndifficulties as easily and as satisfactorily.\n\nEver since he had gathered from Stephen Mr Cripps's wrath on receiving\nthe returned rod, he had been haunted by a dread lest the landlord of\nthe Cockchafer should march up to Saint Dominic's, and possibly make an\nexposure of the unhappy business before the Doctor and the whole school.\nHe therefore, after long hesitation and misgiving, determined himself\nto call at the Cockchafer, and try in some way to settle matters.  One\nthing reassured him.  If Cripps had discovered the crack or the fracture\nin the rod, he would have heard of it long before now; and if he had\nnot, then the longer the time the less chance was there of the damage\nbeing laid at his door.  So he let three weeks elapse, and then went to\nMaltby.  The Cockchafer was a small, unpretentious tavern, frequented\nchiefly by carriers and tradesmen, and, I regret to say, not wholly\nunknown to some of the boys of Saint Dominic's, who were foolish enough\nto persuade themselves that skittles, and billiards, and beer were\nluxuries worth the risk incurred by breaking one of the rules of the\nschool.  No boy was permitted to enter any place of refreshment except a\nconfectioner's in Maltby under the penalty of a severe punishment, which\nmight, in a bad case, mean expulsion.  Loman, therefore, a monitor and a\nSixth Form boy, had to take more than ordinary precautions to reach the\nCockchafer unobserved, which he succeeded in doing, and to his\nsatisfaction--as well as to his trepidation--found Mr Cripps the\nyounger at home.\n\n\"Ho, he! my young shaver,\" was that worthy's greeting, \"here you are at\nlast.\"\n\nThis was not encouraging to begin with.  It sounded very much as if Mr\nCripps had been looking forward to this visit.  However, Loman put as\nbold a face as he could on to it, and replied, \"Hullo, Cripps, how are\nyou?  It's a long time since I saw you; jolly day, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Jolly!\" replied Mr Cripps, looking very gloomy, and drawing a glass of\nbeer for the young gentleman before he ordered it.  Loman did not like\nit at all.  There was something about Cripps's manner that made him feel\nvery uncomfortable.\n\n\"Oh, Cripps,\" he presently began, in as off-hand a manner as he could\nassume under the depressing circumstances--\"Oh, Cripps, about that rod,\nby the way.  I hope you didn't mind my sending it back.  The fact is,\"\n(and here followed a lie which till that moment had not been in the\nspeaker's mind to tell)--\"the fact is, I find I'm to get a present of a\nrod this summer at home, or else of course I would have kept it.\"\n\nMr Cripps said nothing, but began polishing up a pewter pot with a\nnapkin.\n\n\"I hope you got it back all right,\" continued Loman, who felt as if he\nmust say something.  \"They are such fragile things, you know.  I thought\nI'd just leave it in the bag and not touch it, but send it straight\nback, for fear it should be damaged.\"\n\nThere was a queer smile about Mr Cripps's mouth as he asked, \"Then you\ndidn't have a look at it even?\"\n\n\"Well, no, I thought I would--I thought I wouldn't run any risk.\"\n\nLoman was amazed at himself.  He had suddenly made up his mind to tell\none lie, but here they were following one after another, as if he had\ntold nothing but lies all his life!  Alas, there was no drawing back\neither!\n\n\"The fact is,\" he began again, speaking for the sake of speaking, and\nnot even knowing what he was going to say--\"the fact is--\" Here the\nstreet door opened, and there entered hurriedly a boy whom Loman, to his\nconfusion and consternation, recognised as Simon of the Fifth, the\nauthor of the \"Love-Ballad.\"  What could the monitor say for himself to\nexplain his presence in this prohibited house?\n\n\"Hullo, Loman, I say, is that you?\" remarked Simon.\n\n\"Oh, Simon, how are you?\" faltered the wretched Loman; \"I've just popped\nin to speak to Cripps about a fishing-rod.  You'd better not come in;\nyou might get into trouble.\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind.  You won't tell of me, and I won't tell of you.  Glass\nof the usual, please, Cripps.  I say, Loman, was that the fishing-rod\nyou were switching about out of your window that afternoon three weeks\nago?\"\n\nLoman turned red and white by turns, and wished the earth would swallow\nhim!  And to think of this fellow, the biggest donkey in Saint\nDominic's, blurting out the very thing which of all things he had\nstriven to keep concealed!\n\nMr Cripps's mouth worked up into a still more ugly smile.\n\n\"I was below in the garden, you know, and could not make out what you\nwere up to.  You nearly had my eye out with that hook.  I say, what a\nsmash you gave it when it caught in the ivy.  Was it broken right off,\nor only cracked, eh?  Cripps will mend it for you, won't you, Cripps?\"\n\nNeither Mr Cripps nor Loman spoke a word.  The latter saw that\nconcealment was no longer possible; and bitterly he rued the day when\nfirst he heard the name of Cripps.\n\nThat worthy, seeing the game to have come beautifully into his own\nhands, was not slow to take advantage of it.  He beckoned Loman into the\ninner parlour, whither the boy tremblingly followed, leaving Simon to\nfinish his glass of \"the usual\" undisturbed.\n\nI need not repeat the painful conversation that ensued between the\nsharper and the wretched boy.  It was no use for the latter to deny or\nexplain.  He was at the mercy of the man, and poor mercy it was.\nCripps, with many oaths and threats, explained to Loman that he could,\nif he chose, have him up before a magistrate for fraud, and that he\nwould do so for a very little.  Loman might choose for himself between a\ncomplete exposure, involving his disgrace for life, or paying the price\nof the rod down and 20 besides, and he might consider himself lucky more\nwas not demanded.\n\nThe boy, driven to desperation between terror and shame, implored mercy,\nand protested with tears in his eyes that he would do anything, if only\nCripps did not expose him.\n\n\"You know what it is, then,\" replied Cripps.\n\n\"But how am I to get the 20 pounds?  I daren't ask for it at home, and\nthere's no one here will lend it me.  Oh, Cripps, what shall I do?\" and\nthe boy actually caught Mr Cripps's hand in his own as he put the\nquestion.\n\n\"Well, look here,\" said Mr Cripps, unbending a little, \"that 20 pounds\nI must have, there's no mistake about it; but I don't want to be too\nhard on you, and I can put you up to raising the wind.\"\n\n\"Oh, can you?\" gasped Loman, eager to clutch at the faintest straw of\nhope.  \"I'll do anything.\"\n\n\"Very good; then it's just this: I've just got a straight tip about the\nDerby that I know for certain no one else has got--that is, that Sir\nPatrick won't win, favourite and all as he is.  Now there's a friend of\nmine I can introduce you to, who's just wanting to put a twenty on the\nhorse, if he can find any one to take it.  It wouldn't do for me to make\nthe wager, or he'd smell a rat; but if you put your money _against_ the\nhorse, you're bound to win, and all safe.  What do you say?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about betting,\" groaned Loman.  \"Are you quite\nsure I'd win?\"\n\n\"Certain.  If you lose I'll only ask 10 pounds of you, there! that's as\ngood as giving you 10 pounds myself on the horse, eh?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Loman, \"I suppose I must.  Where is he?\"\n\n\"Wait here a minute, and I'll bring him round.\"\n\nLoman waited, racked by a sense of ignominy and terror.  Yet this seemed\nhis only hope.  Could he but get this 20 pounds and pay off Cripps he\nwould be happy.  Oh, how he repented listening to that first temptation\nto deceive!\n\nIn due time Mr Cripps returned with his friend, who was very civil on\nhearing Loman's desire to bet against Sir Patrick.\n\n\"Make it a 50 pounds note while you are about it,\" said he.\n\n\"No, 20 pounds is all I want to go for,\" replied Loman.\n\n\"Twenty then, all serene, sir,\" said the gentleman, booking the bet.\n\"What'll you take to drink?\"\n\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said Loman, hurriedly rising to leave.\n\n\"Good-day, sir,\" said Cripps, holding out his hand.\n\nLoman looked at the hand and then at Mr Cripps's face.  There was the\nsame ugly leer about the latter, into which a spark of anger was infused\nas the boy still held back from the proffered hand.\n\nWith an inward groan Loman gave the hand a spiritless grasp, and then\nhurried back miserable and conscience-stricken to Saint Dominic's.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. THE \"DOMINICAN\" AGAIN.\n\nThe circumstances which had attended the publication of the first number\nof the _Dominican_ had been such as to throw a damper over the future\nsuccess of that valuable paper.  It was most uncomfortably connected in\nthe minds of the Fifth with the cowardice of Oliver Greenfield, and with\nthe stigma which his conduct had cast upon the whole Form, and they one\nand all experienced a great diminution of interest in its future.\n\nThe Fifth were far more intent on vindicating their reputation with the\nSixth--and, indeed, with the rest of the school.  They sought every\nopportunity of bringing on a collision with the monitors.  One or two of\ntheir number went, so far as to pick quarrels with members of the rival\nclass, in hopes of a fight.  But in this they were not successful.  The\nSixth chose to look upon this display of feeling among their juniors as\na temporary aberration of mind, and were by no means to be tempted into\nhostilities.  They asserted their authority wherever they could enforce\nit, and sacrificed it whenever it seemed more discreet to do so.  Only\none thing evoked a temporary display of vexation from them, and that was\nwhen Ricketts and Braddy appeared one day, arm-in-arm, in the passages\nwith _tall hats_ on their heads.  Now, tall hats on week-days were the\nexclusive privilege of the Sixth at Saint Dominic's, and, worn by them\nduring school hours, served as the badge of monitorship.  This action on\nthe part of the Fifth, therefore, was as good as a usurpation of\nmonitorial rights, and that the Sixth were not disposed to stand.\nHowever, Raleigh, the captain, when appealed to, pooh-poohed the matter.\n\"Let them be,\" said he; \"what do you want to make a row about it for?\nIf the boys do mistake them for monitors, so much the less row in the\npassages.\"\n\nRaleigh was always a man of peace--though it was rumoured he could, if\nhe chose, thrash any two Dominicans going--and the monitors were much\ndisgusted to find that he did not authorise them to interfere with the\nFifth in the matter.  But the Fifth _were_ interfered with in another\nquarter, and in a way which caused them to drop their chimney-pots\ncompletely.  One afternoon the entire Fourth Junior appeared in the\ncorridors in their Sunday tiles!  In their Sunday tiles they slid down\nthe banisters; in their Sunday tiles they played leapfrog; in their\nSunday tiles they executed a monster tug-of-war in the bottom corridor!\nStephen and Bramble fought their usual battle in top hats, and Master\nPaul insisted on wearing the same decoration while washing up Oliver's\ntea-things.  It was a splendid hit, and for once in a way Guinea-pigs\nand Tadpoles scored one, for the Fifth appeared next day in their\nordinary \"boilers,\" and the dignity of the monitors was vindicated.\n\nBut the blood was up between Fifth and Sixth, and each Form looked\nforward to the match, Sixth _versus_ School, with redoubled interest.\n\n\"Were not these boys fools?\" some one asks.\n\nTo be sure they were, sir.  But what of that? they were none the less\nboys, and most of them fine young fellows, too, with all their nonsense.\n\nHowever, as has been said, all this came out of the circumstances which\nattended the bringing out of the first number of the _Dominican_, and\nthere seemed but a poor look-out for Number 2, which was now nearly due,\nin consequence.\n\n\"What on earth am I to do?\" asked Pembury of Tom Senior one day; \"I've\nnot got a single contribution yet.  There's you making out you're too\nbusy, and Rick the same.  It's all humbug, I know!  What are you busy at\nI'd like to know?  I never saw you busy yet.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, old man,\" said Tom, \"I'm awfully sorry, but I've got a\ntremendous lot to do.  I'm going to try for the French prize; I am,\nreally.\"\n\n\"And you'll get it, too; rather!  Wasn't it you who translated `I know\nthe way to write' into `_Je non le chemin a writer_' eh?  Oh, stick to\nFrench by all means, Tom; it's in your line!  But you might just as well\nwrite for Number 2.\"\n\n\"I really can't this time,\" said Tom.\n\nRicketts had an excuse very similar.  Bullinger had hurt his foot, he\nsaid, and could not possibly write; and Braddy had begun to study\nfossils, he said, and was bound to devote all his spare time to them.\nTo all of whom Master Pembury gave a piece of his mind.\n\n\"Wray, old man,\" said he, that evening, \"you and Noll and I shall have\nto do the whole thing between us, that's all about it.\"\n\n\"Awfully sorry!\" said Wraysford; \"you'll have to let me off this time.\nI'm working like nails for the Nightingale.\"\n\n\"Bother the Nightingale, I say!  What is it to the _Dominican_?  Come, I\nsay, old man, that won't do! you aren't going to leave me in the lurch\nlike all the rest?\"\n\nBut Wraysford was; he would gladly have helped if he could, but he\nreally must not this time; perhaps he would for the next.\n\nOliver was as bad; he declared the things he had written before--even\nwith Pembury's assistance--had taken him such ages to do, that he wasn't\ngoing in for the next number.  He was very sorry to disappoint, and all\nthat; but if Tony was in for a scholarship next Michaelmas he would\nunderstand the reason.  Why not let the thing drop this month?\n\nThis, however, by no means met Tony's views.  A pretty figure he would\ncut if it were to be said he couldn't keep up a paper for two numbers\nrunning!  No! his mind was made up.  Number 2 _should_ come out, even if\nhe wrote every word of it himself!  And with that determination he\nhobbled off to his study.  Here he met Simon waiting for him.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the poet; \"I only brought this, if you'll put it in.  I think\nit's not bad.  I could make it longer if you like.  I find poetry comes\nso easily, you know!\"\n\nTony glanced over the paper and grinned.  \"Thanks, awfully!  This will\ndo capitally; it would spoil it to make it any longer.  You're a brick,\nSimon!  I wish _I_ could write poetry.\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind.  I could do some more bits about other things, you\nknow, if you like.\"\n\nPembury said he didn't think he should require any more \"bits,\" but was\nawfully obliged by this one, which was first-rate, a recommendation\nwhich sent Simon away happy to his study, there immediately to compose\nthe opening stanza of his famous epic, \"The Sole's Allegery--a sacred\nPoem.\"\n\nWith one contribution in hand, Tony locked his door and sat down to\nwrite.  There was something out of the common about Pembury.  With the\nbody of a cripple he had the heart of a lion, and difficulties only made\nit more dauntless.  Any one else would have thought twice, indeed,\nbefore undertaking the task he was now setting himself to do, and\nninety-nine out of every hundred would have abandoned it before it was\nhalf done.  But Tony was indomitable.  Every night that week he locked\nhis study-door, and threats and kicks and entreaties would not open it\neven to his dearest friends.  And slowly the huge white sheet before him\nshowed the signs of his diligence.  The great long columns, one after\nanother, filled up; paragraph followed paragraph, and article article.\nHe coolly continued the \"History of Saint Dominic's\" begun last month by\nBullinger, and the \"Reports of the Sixth Form Debates\" commenced by Tom\nSenior.  And the \"Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse\" went on just as if\nWraysford had never abandoned it; and the poem on the Guinea-pigs,\npromised in Number 1, by the author of \"To a Tadpole,\" duly appeared\nalso.  Besides this, there were the continuations of Tony's own\narticles, and his \"Personal Notes,\" and \"Squeaks from Tadpoleopolis,\"\nand advertisements just as usual; until, in due time, the last column\nwas filled up, the sheet triumphantly fixed in its frame, and as\ntriumphantly hung up on its own particular nails on the wall outside the\nFifth Form door.\n\nIt was a feat to be proud of, and Tony was justly and pardonably proud.\nIt was at least a gratification next morning to see not only that the\nschool generally took unabated interest in the _Dominican_, but that he\nhad fairly astonished his own class-fellows.  Their admiration of the\neditor was unbounded and undisguised.  Their consciences had all, more\nor less, reproached them for backing out of their responsibilities in\nthe way they had; and now it quite touched them to see how,\nnotwithstanding, Anthony had by his own labour made up for their defect,\nand sustained the reputation of the Fifth before all the school.\n\nThe crush outside the door was greater than ever this time, and Master\nPaul, who again acted as policeman, was obliged to summon Stephen to his\nassistance in watching to see that no damage came to the precious\ndocument.\n\nThe account of the Alphabet Match was very graphic, and written quite in\nthe usual absurd \"sporting style,\" greatly to the amusement of most of\nthose who had taken part in it.  Here is a specimen:--\n\n\"At 4.30, sharp, the leather was taken into custody by `Gamey' Raikes,\nat the wash-house end, who tried what his artful `yorkers' could do in\nthe way of dissolving partnership.  But Teddy Loman kept his willow\nstraight up, and said `Not at home' to every poser, leaving Noll to do\nall the smacking.  This pretty business might have gone on till\nto-morrow week had the men's upper stories been as `O.K.' as their\ntimbers, but they messed about over a pretty snick of Noll's, and, after\npopping the question three times, Teddy got home just in time to see his\ntwo bails tumble out of their groove.  Teddy didn't like this, and\nbowled his partner a wide compliment, which Noll, like a sensible man,\ndidn't walk out to, and Teddy was astonished to find his party could get\non without him;\" and so on.\n\nThis version of the incident was by no means pleasant to Loman, but to\nevery one else it was highly diverting, and it actually made one or two\nof the Fifth think that Oliver, after all, had not done such a very\ndiscreditable thing in taking that angry word in silence.  If only he\nhad shown more spirit about the blow, they could have forgiven the rest.\n\nThen followed more from the \"Sixth Form Mouse\":--\n\n\"The Sixth held a Cabinet Council to-day to discuss who should go out\nfor nuts.  The choice fell on Callonby.  I wonder why the Sixth are so\nfond of nuts.  Why, monkeys eat nuts.  Perhaps that is the reason.  What\na popular writer Mr Bohn is with the Sixth! they even read him at\nlesson time!  I was quite sorry when the Doctor had to bone Wren's Bohn.\nI wonder, by the way, why that bird found it so hard to translate the\nsimplest sentence without his Bohn!  The Doctor really shouldn't--I hope\nhe will restore to Wren his backbone by giving him back his Bohn.  Hum!\nI heard some one smiling.  I'll go.\"\n\nThe Sixth, a good many of them, were imprudent enough to look very\nguilty at the reading of this extract, a circumstance which appeared to\nafford keenest delight to the Fifth.  But as Simon's poem followed, they\nhad other food for thought at the moment.  The poem was entitled--\n\n  A Revverie.\n\n  I.\n\n  I walked me in the garden, all in the garden fair,\n  And mused upon my hindmost sole all in the open air.\n  When lo!  I heard above my head a sound all like a wisk,\n  I stepped me aside thereat out of the way so brisk.\n\n  [Hindmost sole, possibly \"inmost soul\"; wisk, possibly \"whisk.\"]\n\n  II.\n\n  I looked me up, and there behold! and lo! a window broad,\n  And out thereof I did dizzern a gallant fishing-rod,\n  All sporting in the breaze untill the hook in ivy caught,\n  And then the little lad he tried to pull it harder than he ought.\n\n  III.\n\n  It broke, alas! and so messeems fades life's perplecksing dreems,\n  And vanish like that fishing-rod all in the dark messeems.\n  I wonder if my perplecksing dreems will vanish like the rod in the\n  dark,\n  And I shall rise and rise and rise and rise all like a lark.\n\n  IV.\n\n  Oh wood I was a lark, a lark all lofty in the sky,\n  I do not know what I should do to quench my blazing eye.\n  I'd look me down on Dominic's, and think of the days when I was young,\n  Or would I was an infant meek all sucking of my thumb.\n\nAgain Simon, who had watched with intense interest the reception of his\npoem, was perplexed to notice the amusement it had caused.  Even Pembury\nhad mistaken its \"inmost soul,\" for he had placed it in the column\ndevoted to \"Facetiae.\"  Nor could Simon understand why, for the next\nweek, every one he met had his thumb in his mouth.  It was very queer--\none of life's mysteries--and he had thoughts of embodying the fact in\nhis \"Sole's Allegery,\" which was now rapidly approaching completion.\n\nAfter this bubbling up of pure verse there followed a few remarks about\nGuinea-pigs and Tadpoles, which had the effect of highly incensing those\nyoung gentlemen.  The paragraph was entitled--\n\n\"Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Half a dozen mixed Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were offered for sale by\nauction on the centre landing yesterday.  There was only a small\nattendance.  The auctioneer said he couldn't honestly recommend the lot,\nbut they must be got rid of at any cost.  He had scrubbed their faces\nand combed their hair for the occasion, but couldn't guarantee that\nstate of things to last.  But they might turn out to be of use as\nsubstitutes in case worms should become scarce; and, any way, by boiling\ndown their fingers and collars, many gallons of valuable ink could be\nobtained.  The first bid was a farthing, which seemed to be far beyond\nthe expectation of the salesman, who at once knocked the lot down.  The\nsale was such a success that it is proposed to knock down several more\nlots in a like manner.\"\n\nThe rage of the Fourth Junior on reading this paragraph was something\nawful to witness.  Bramble, feeling he must kick somebody on the legs,\nkicked Stephen, who, forgetting that he was on police duty, seized\nBramble by the hair of his head and rushed off with him to the\n\"meeting,\" closely followed by Paul and the whole swarm.  That meeting\nlasted from three to five.  What awful threats were uttered, and what\nawful vows taken, no one knew.  At five o'clock Stephen's fight with\nBramble came off as usual, and all that evening Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles\ndid nothing but make paper darts.  It was certain a crisis had come in\ntheir history.  The \"dogs of war\" were let loose!  They would be\nrevenged on somebody!  So they at once began to be revenged on one\nanother, till it should be possible to unite their forces against the\ncommon foe.\n\nBut the remainder of the crowd stayed on to read one more extract from\nthe _Dominican_.  Under the title of \"Reviews of Books,\" Anthony had\nreviewed in style the last number of the _Sixth Form Magazine_ as\nfollows:--\n\n\"This book appears to be the praiseworthy attempt of some ambitious\nlittle boys to enter the field of letters.  We are always pleased to\nencourage juvenile talent, but we would suggest that our young friends\nmight have done better had they kept to their picture-books a little\nlonger before launching out into literature on their own account.  In\nthe words of the poet we might say--\n\n  \"Babies, wait a little longer,\n  Till the little wings are stronger,\n  Then you'll fly away.\"\n\n\"Nevertherless, we would refer to one or two of these interesting\nattempts.  Take, for example, the essay on the `Character of Julius\nCaesar,' by one who signs himself Raleigh.  This is very well written.\nPains have been taken about the formation of the letters, and some of\nthe capitals are specially worthy of praise.  For one so young, we\nrarely saw the capital D so well done.  Dr Smith, were he alive, would\nbe pleased to see his remarks on Caesar so well and accurately copied\nout.  Master Wren gives us some verse--a translation out of Horace.  We\nwonder if Mr Wren is any relation to the late Jenny Wren who married\nMr Cock Robin.  We should imagine from these verses that Mr Wren must\nbe well acquainted with _Robbin_.  Take one more, Master Loman's `A\nFunny Story.'  We are sorry to find Master Loman tells stories.  Boys\nshouldn't tell stories; it's not right.  But Master Loman unfortunately\ndoes tell stories, and this is one.  He calls it `A Funny Story.'  That\nis a story to begin with, for it is not funny.  We don't know what\nMaster Loman thinks funny; perhaps he calls being run out at cricket\nfunny, or hitting another boy in the mouth when he's looking another\nway.  In any case, we can't make out why he calls this story funny.  The\nonly funny thing about it is its title, and his spelling `attach'\n`attatch.'  The last is really funny.  It shows how partial Mr Loman is\nto _tea_.  If this funny story is the result of his partiality to tea,\nwe are afraid it was very weak stuff.\"\n\nLoman, who had already been made dreadfully uncomfortable by Simon's\npoem, made no secret of his rage over this number of the _Dominican_.\nHe was one of those vain fellows who cannot see a jest where it is\nlevelled at themselves.  The rest of the Sixth had the sense, whatever\nthey felt, to laugh at Anthony's hard hits.  But not so Loman; he lost\nhis temper completely.  He ordered the _Dominican_ to be taken down; he\nthreatened to report the whole Fifth to the Doctor.  He would not allow\nthe junior boys to stand and read it.  In short, he made a regular ass\nof himself.\n\nUndoubtedly Anthony had put a great deal of venom into his pen.  Still,\nby taking all the poison and none of the humour to himself Loman made a\ngreat mistake, and displayed a most unfortunate amount of weakness.\n\nHe shut himself up in his study in a fume; he boxed Stephen's ears for\nnothing at all, and would see no one for the rest of the evening.  He\nknew well he could not have given his enemies a greater crow over him\nthan such conduct, and yet he could not command his vanity to act\notherwise.\n\nBut that evening, just before tea-time, something happened which gave\nLoman more to think about than the _Dominican_.  A letter marked\n\"Immediate\" came to him by the post.  It was from Cripps, to say that,\nafter all, Sir Patrick _had_ won the Derby!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. COMPANY AT THE COCKCHAFER.\n\nCripps's letter was as follows:\n\n\"Hon. Sir,--This comes hoping you are well.  You may like to know Sir\nPatrick won.  The tip was all out.  Honourable Sir,--My friend would\nlike his ten pounds sharp, as he's a poor man.  Please call in on\nSaturday afternoon.  Your very humble servant, Ben Cripps.\"\n\nThis letter was startling enough to drive fifty _Dominicans_ out of\nLoman's head, and for a long time he could hardly realise how bad the\nnews it contained was.\n\nHe had reckoned to a dead certainty on winning the bet which Cripps had\nadvised him to make with his friend.  Not that Loman knew anything about\nracing matters, but Cripps had been so confident, and it seemed so safe\nto bet against this one particular horse, that the idea of events\nturning out otherwise had never once entered his head.\n\nHe went to the door and shouted for Stephen, who presently appeared with\na paper dart in his hand.\n\n\"Greenfield,\" said Loman, \"cut down at once to Maltby and bring me a\nnewspaper.\"\n\nStephen stared.\n\n\"I've got my lessons to do,\" he said.\n\n\"Leave them here, I'll do them,\" replied Loman; \"look sharp.\"\n\nStill Stephen hesitated.\n\n\"We aren't allowed out after seven without leave,\" he faltered, longing\nto get back to the war preparations in the Fourth Junior.\n\n\"I know that, and I give you leave--there!\" said Loman, with all the\nmonitorial dignity he could assume.  This quite disarmed Stephen.  Of\ncourse a monitor could do no wrong, and it was no use objecting on that\nscore.\n\nStill he was fain to find some other excuse.\n\n\"I say, will it do in the morning?\" he began.\n\nLoman's only reply was a book shied at his fag's head--quite explicit\nenough for all practical purposes.  So Stephen hauled down his colours\nand prepared to start.\n\n\"Look sharp back,\" said Loman, \"and don't let any one see you going out.\nLook here, you can get yourself some brandy-balls with this.\"\n\nStephen was not philosopher enough to argue with himself why, if he had\nleave to go out, he ought to avoid being seen going out.  He pocketed\nLoman's extra penny complacently, and giving one last longing look in\nthe direction of the Fourth Junior, slipped quietly out of the school\nand made the best of his way down to Maltby.\n\nIt was not easy at that time of day to get a paper.  Stephen tried half\na dozen stationers' shops, but they were all sold out.  They were\nevidently more sought after than brandy-balls, of which he had no\ndifficulty in securing a pennyworth at an early stage of his pilgrimage.\nThe man in the sweet-shop told him his only chance of getting a paper\nwas at the railway station.\n\nSo to the station he strolled, with a brandy-ball in each cheek.  Alas!\nthe stall was closed for the day.\n\nStephen did not like to be beaten, but there was nothing for it now but\nto give up this \"paper-chase,\" and return to Loman with a report of his\nill-success.\n\nAs he trotted back up High Street, looking about everywhere but in the\ndirection in which he was going (as is the habit of small boys), and\nwondering in his heart whether his funds could possibly stand the strain\nof another pennyworth of brandy-balls, he suddenly found himself in\nsharp collision with a man who expressed himself on the subject of\nclumsy boys generally in no very measured terms.\n\nStephen looked up and saw Mr Cripps the younger standing before him.\n\n\"Why!\" exclaimed that worthy, giving over his irascible expletives, and\nadopting an air of unfeigned pleasure, \"why, if it ain't young Master\nGreenhorn.  Ha, ha!  How do, my young bantam?  Pretty bobbish, eh?\"\n\nStephen did not know exactly what was meant by \"bobbish,\" but replied\nthat he was quite well, and sorry he had trodden on Mr Cripps's toes.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Mr Cripps, magnanimously, \"you're a light weight.\nAnd so you're taking a dander down town, are you? looking for lollipops,\neh?\"\n\nStephen blushed very red at this.  However had Mr Cripps guessed about\nthe brandy-balls?\n\n\"I came to get a paper for Loman,\" he said, \"but they're all sold out.\"\n\n\"No, are they?  I wonder what Mr Loman wants with a paper, now?\"\n\n\"He said it was very important, and I was to be sure to get one of\nto-day's,\" said Stephen.  \"Do you know where I can get one?\"\n\n\"Of course.  Come along with me; I've got one at home you can have.  And\nso he said it was very important, did he?  That's queer.  There's\nnothing in to-day's paper at all.  Only something about a low\nhorse-race.  He don't want it for that, I guess; eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I shouldn't think,\" said Stephen, trotting along beside his\namiable acquaintance.\n\nMr Cripps was certainly a very friendly man, and as he conducted\nStephen to the Cockchafer, Stephen felt quite a liking for him, and\ncouldn't understand why Oliver and Wraysford both ran him down.\n\nTrue, Mr Cripps did use some words which didn't seem exactly proper,\nbut that Stephen put down to the habit of men in that part.  The man\nseemed to take such an interest in boys generally, and in Stephen in\nparticular, and was so interested and amused to hear all about the\nGuinea-pigs, and the _Dominican_, and the Sixth _versus_ School, that\nStephen felt quite drawn out to him.  And then he told Stephen such a\nlot of funny stories, and treated him with such evident consideration,\nthat the small boy felt quite flattered and delighted.\n\nSo they reached the Cockchafer.  Here Stephen, whose former visits had\nall been to the lock-house, pulled up.\n\n\"I say,\" said he, \"is this a public-house?\"\n\n\"Getting on that way,\" said Mr Cripps.\n\n\"We aren't allowed to go in public-houses,\" said Stephen, \"it's one of\nthe rules.\"\n\n\"Ah, quite right too; not a good thing for boys at all.  We'll go in by\nthe private door into my house,\" said Mr Cripps.\n\nStephen was not quite comfortable at this evasion, but followed Mr\nCripps by the side door into his bar parlour.\n\n\"You won't forget the paper,\" he said, \"please.  I've got to be back in\nschool directly.\"\n\n\"I'll have a look for it.  Now, I guess you like ginger-beer, don't\nyou?\"\n\nStephen was particularly partial to ginger-beer, as it happened, and\nsaid so.\n\n\"That's the style,\" said Mr Cripps, producing a bottle.  \"Walk into\nthat while I go and get the paper.\"\n\nStephen did walk into it with great relish, and began to think Mr\nCripps quite a gentleman.  He was certain, even if that bat had been a\npoor one, it was quite worth the money paid for it, and Oliver was\nunjust in calling Cripps hard names.\n\nThe landlord very soon returned with the paper.\n\n\"Here you are, young governor.  Now don't hurry away.  It's lonely here\nall by myself, and I like a young gentleman like you to talk to.  I knew\na nice little boy once, just your age, that used to come and see me\nregular once a week and play bagatelle with me.  He was a good player at\nit too!\"\n\n\"Could he get clear-board twice running with two balls?\" asked Stephen,\nhalf jealous of the fame of this unknown rival.\n\n\"Eh!--no, scarcely that.  He wasn't quite such a dab as that.\"\n\n\"I can do it,\" said Stephen with a superior smile.\n\n\"You?  Not a bit of you!\" said Mr Cripps, incredulously.\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" reiterated Stephen, delighted to have astonished his host.\n\n\"I must see it before I can believe that,\" said Mr Cripps.  \"Suppose\nyou show me on my board.\"\n\nStephen promptly accepted the challenge, and forgetting in his\nexcitement all about school rules or Loman's orders accompanied Cripps\nto the bagatelle-room, with its sanded floor, smelling of stale tobacco\nand beer-dregs.  His first attempt, greatly to Mr Cripps's glee, was\nunsuccessful.\n\n\"I knew you couldn't,\" exclaimed that worthy.\n\n\"I know I can do it,\" said Stephen, excitedly.  \"Let's try again.\"\n\nAfter a few more trials he made the two clear-boards, and Mr Cripps was\nduly astonished and impressed.\n\n\"That's what I call smart play,\" said he.  \"Now, if I was a betting man,\nI'd wager a sixpence you couldn't do it again.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can, but I won't bet,\" said Stephen.  He did do it again, and\nMr Cripps said it was a good job for him the young swell didn't bet, or\nhe would have lost his sixpence.  Stephen was triumphant.\n\nHow long he would have gone on showing off his prowess to the admiring\nlandlord of the Cockchafer, and how far he might have advanced in the\nart of public-house bagatelle, I cannot say, but the sudden striking of\na clock and the entry of visitors into the room reminded him where he\nwas.\n\n\"I must go back now,\" he said, hurriedly.\n\n\"Must you?  Well, come again soon.  I've a great fancy to learn that\nthere stoke.  I'm a born fool at bagatelle.  What do you say to another\nginger-beer before you go?\"\n\nStephen said \"Thank you,\" and then taking the newspaper in his hand bade\nCripps good-bye.\n\n\"Good-bye, my fine young fellow.  You're one of the right sort, you are.\nNo stuck-up nonsense about you.  That's why I fancy you.  Bye-bye.  My\nlove to Mr Loman.\"\n\nStephen hurried back to Saint Dominic's as fast as his legs would carry\nhim.  He was not quite comfortable about his evening's proceedings,\nalthough he was not aware of having done anything wicked.  Loman, a\nmonitor, had given him leave to go down to Maltby, so that was hardly a\ncrime; and as to the Cockchafer--well, he had only been in the private\npart of the house, and not the public bar, and surely there had been no\nharm in drinking ginger-beer and playing bagatelle, especially when he\nhad distinctly refused to bet on the latter.  But, explain it as he\nwould, Stephen felt uncomfortable enough to determine him to say as\nlittle as possible about his expedition.\n\nHe found Loman impatiently awaiting him.\n\n\"Wherever have you been to all this time?\" he demanded.\n\n\"The papers were all sold out,\" said Stephen.  \"I tried seven places.\"\n\nLoman had eagerly caught up and opened the paper while Stephen nervously\nmade this explanation, and he took no further heed of his fag, who\npresently, seeing he was no longer wanted, and relieved to get out of\nreach of questions, prudently retired.\n\nA glance sufficed to confirm the bad news about the Derby.  Sir Patrick\nhad won, and it was a fact therefore that Loman owed Cripps and his\nfriend between them thirty pounds, without the least possibility of\npaying them.\n\nOne thing was certain.  He must see Cripps on Saturday, and trust to his\nluck (though that of late had not been very trustworthy) to pull him\nthrough, somehow.\n\nAlas! what a spirit this, in which to meet difficulties!  Loman had yet\nto learn that it is one thing to regret, and another thing to repent;\nthat it is one thing to call one's self a fool, and another thing,\nquite, to cease to be one.\n\nBut, as he said to himself, he must go through with it now, and the\nfirst step took him deeper than ever into the mire.\n\nFor the coming Saturday was the day of the great cricket match, Sixth\nversus School, from which a Dominican would as soon think of deserting\nas of emigrating.\n\nBut Loman must desert if he was to keep his appointment, and he managed\nthe proceeding with his now characteristic untruthfulness; a practice he\nwould have scorned only a few months ago.  How easy the first wrong\nstep!  What a long weary road when one, with aching heart, attempts to\nretrace the way!  And at present Loman had made no serious effort in\nthat direction.\n\nOn the Friday morning, greatly to the astonishment of all his\nclass-fellows, he appeared in his place with his arm in a sling.\n\n\"Hullo, Loman!\" said Wren, the first whom he encountered, \"what's the\nrow with you?\"\n\n\"Sprained my wrist,\" said Loman, to whom, alas!--so easy is the downward\npath when once entered on--a lie had become an easy thing to utter.\n\n\"How did you manage that?\" exclaimed Callonby.  \"Mind you get it right\nby to-morrow, or we _shall_ be in a fix.\"\n\nThis little piece of flattery pleased Loman, who said, \"I'm afraid I\nshan't be able to play.\"\n\n\"What!  Who's that won't be able to play?\" said Raleigh, coming up in\nunwonted excitement.\n\n\"Loman; he's sprained his wrist.\"\n\n\"Have you shown it to Dr Splints?\" said Raleigh.\n\n\"No,\" said Loman, beginning to feel uncomfortable.  \"It's hardly bad\nenough for that.\"\n\n\"Then it's hardly bad enough to prevent your playing,\" said Raleigh,\ndrily.\n\nLoman did not like this.  He and Raleigh never got on well together, and\nit was evident the captain was more angry than sympathetic now.\n\n\"Whatever shall we do for bowlers?\" said some one.\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" said Loman, wishing he was anywhere but where he\nwas; \"but how am I to help?\"\n\n\"Whatever induced you to sprain your wrist?\" said Wren.  \"You might just\nas well have put it off till Monday.\"\n\n\"Just fancy how foolish we shall look if those young beggars beat us, as\nthey are almost sure to do,\" said Winter.\n\nLoman was quickly losing his temper, for all this was, or seemed to be,\naddressed pointedly to him.\n\n\"What's the use of talking like that?\" he retorted.  \"You ass, you! as\nif I could help.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder if you could help,\" replied Winter.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested some one, \"it was the _Dominican_ put him out of\njoint.  It certainly did give him a rap over the knuckles.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Loman, angrily, and half drawing his\nsupposed sprained hand out of the sling.\n\n\"Shut up, you fellows,\" interposed Raleigh, authoritatively.  \"Baynes\nwill play in the eleven to-morrow instead of Loman, so there's an end of\nthe matter.\"\n\nLoman was sorely mortified.  He had expected his defection would create\nquite a sensation, and that his class-fellows would be inconsolable at\nhis accident.  Instead of that, he had only contrived to quarrel with\nnearly all of them, alienating their sympathy; and in the end he was to\nbe quietly superseded by Baynes, and the match was to go on as if he had\nnever been heard of at Saint Dominic's.\n\n\"Never mind; I'm bound to go and see Cripps.  Besides,\" said he to\nhimself, \"they'll miss me to-morrow, whatever they say to-day.\"\n\nNext day, just when the great match was beginning, and the entire school\nwas hanging breathless on the issue of every ball, Loman quietly slipped\nout of Saint Dominic's, and walked rapidly and nervously down to the\nCockchafer in Maltby.\n\n\"What _shall_ I say to Cripps?\" was the wild question he kept asking\nhimself as he went along; and the answer had not come by the time he\nfound himself standing within that worthy's respectable premises.\n\nMr Cripps was in his usual good humour.\n\n\"Why, it's Mr Loman! so it is!\" he exclaimed, in a rapture.  \"Now who\n_would_ have thought of seeing _you_ here?\"\n\nLoman was perplexed.\n\n\"Why, you told me to come this afternoon,\" said he.\n\n\"Did I?  Ah, I dare say!  Never mind.  Very kind of a young gentleman\nlike you to come and see the likes of me.  What'll you take?\"\n\nLoman did not know what to make of this at all.\n\n\"I came to see you about that--that horse you told me to bet against,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I remember.  What's his name?  Sir Patrick, wasn't it?  My friend told\nme that he'd had the best of that.  What was it?  Ten bob?\"\n\nThis affected ignorance of the whole matter in hand was utterly\nbewildering to Loman, who had fully expected that, instead of having to\nexplain himself, he would have the matter pretty plainly explained to\nhim by his sportive acquaintance.\n\n\"No, ten pounds.  That was what I was to pay if the horse won; and,\nCripps, I can't pay it, or the twenty pounds either, to you.\"\n\nCripps whistled.\n\n\"That's a go and no mistake!\" he said.  \"Afraid it won't do, mister.\"\n\n\"You told me Sir Patrick was sure not to win,\" said Loman.\n\n\"Ah, there was several of us took in over that there horse,\" coolly said\nMr Cripps.  \"I lost a shilling myself over him.  Nice to be you, flush\nof cash, and able to pay straight down.\"\n\n\"I can't pay,\" said Loman.\n\n\"Ah, but the governor can, I'll wager,\" insinuated Cripps.\n\n\"He would never do it!  It's no use asking him,\" said Loman.\n\nCripps whistled again.\n\n\"That's awkward.  And my friend wants his money, too, and so do I.\"\n\n\"I really can't pay,\" said Loman.  \"I say, Cripps, let us off that\ntwenty pounds.  I really didn't mean about that rod.\"\n\nMr Cripps fired up in righteous indignation.\n\n\"Ah, I dare say, mister.  You'll come and snivel now, will you?  But you\nwere ready enough to cheat a honest man when you saw a chance.  No, I'll\nhave my twenty or else there'll be a rumpus.  Make no mistake of that!\"\n\nThe bare idea of a \"rumpus\" cowed Loman at once.  Anything but that.\n\n\"Come, now,\" said Cripps, encouragingly, \"I'll wager you can raise the\nwind somewheres.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew how.  I see no chance whatever, unless--\" and here a\nbrilliant idea suddenly struck him--\"unless I get the Nightingale.  Of\ncourse; I say, Cripps, will you wait till September?\"\n\n\"What!  Three months!  And how do you suppose I'm to find bread to eat\ntill then?\" exclaimed Mr Cripps.\n\n\"Oh, do!\" said Loman.  \"I'm certain to be able to pay then.  I forgot\nall about the Nightingale.\"\n\n\"The Nightingale?  It must be an uncommon spicy bird to fetch in thirty\npound!\"\n\n\"It's not a bird,\" said Loman, laughing; \"it's a scholarship.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A scholarship.  I'm in for an exam, you know, and whoever's first gets\nfifty-pounds a year for three years.\"\n\n\"But suppose you ain't first? what then?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I'm _sure_ to be.  I've only got Fifth Form fellows against me,\nand I'm certain to beat them!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr Cripps, \"I don't so much care about your nightingales\nand cock-sparrows and scholarships, and all them traps, but I'd like to\noblige you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" cried Loman, delighted, and feeling already as if the\ndebt was paid.  \"And you'll get your friend to wait too, won't you?\"\n\n\"Can't do that.  I shall have to square up with him and look to you for\nthe lot, and most likely drop into the workhouse for my pains.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  You can be quite certain of getting the money.\"\n\n\"Well, blessed if I ain't a easy-going cove,\" said Mr Cripps, with a\ngrin.  \"It ain't every one as 'ud wait three months on your poll-parrot\nscholarships, or whatever you call 'em.  Come, business is business.\nGive us your promise on a piece of paper--if you must impose upon me.\"\nLoman, only too delighted, wrote at Mr Cripps's dictation a promise to\npay the thirty pounds, together with five pounds interest, in September,\nand quitted the Cockchafer with as light a heart as if he had actually\npaid off every penny of the debt.\n\n\"Of course I'm safe to get it!  Why ever didn't I think of that before?\nWon't I just work the rest of the term!  Nothing like having an object\nwhen you're grinding.\"\n\nWith this philosophical reflection he re-entered Saint Dominic's, and\nunobserved rejoined the spectators in the cricket-field, just in time to\nwitness a very exciting finish to a fiercely contested encounter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. SIXTH VERSUS SCHOOL.\n\nNever had a Sixth versus School Match been looked forward to with more\nexcitement at Saint Dominic's than the present one.  Party feeling had\nbeen running high all the term, intensified on the one hand by the\nunpopularity of some of the monitors, and on the other by the defiant\nattitude of the Fifth and the tone of their organ, the _Dominican_.\n\nThe lower school naturally looked on with interest at this rivalry\nbetween the two head forms, the result of which, as might have been\nexpected, was the reverse of beneficial for the discipline of the school\ngenerally.  If the big boys set a bad example and disregard rules, what\ncan one expect of the little ones?\n\nSo far, anything like conflict had been avoided.  The Fifth had\n\"cheeked\" the Sixth, and the Sixth had snubbed the Fifth; but with the\nexception of Loman's assault on Oliver, which had not led to a fight,\nthe war had been strictly one of words.  Now, however, the opposing\nforces were to be ranged face to face at cricket; and to the junior\nschool the opportunity seemed a grand one for a display of partisanship\none side or the other.\n\nThe School Eleven, on this occasion, moreover, consisted exclusively of\nFifth Form boys--a most unusual circumstance, and one which seemed to be\nthe result quite as much of management as of accident.  At least so said\nthe disappointed heroes of the Fourth.\n\nThe match was, in fact--whatever it was formally styled--a match between\nthe Sixth and the Fifth, and the partisans of either side looked upon it\nas a decisive event in the respective glories of the two top forms.\n\nAnd now the day had come.  All Saint Dominic's trooped out to the\nmeadows, and there was a rush of small boys as usual for the front\nbenches.  Stephen found himself along with his trusty ally, Paul, and\nhis equally trusty enemy, Bramble, and some ten other Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles, wedged like sardines upon a form that would comfortably hold\nsix, eagerly canvassing the prospects of the struggle.\n\n\"The Sixth are going to win in a single innings, if you fellows want to\nknow,\" announced Bramble, with all the authority of one who knows.\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" replied Paul.  \"The Fifth are safe to win, I tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"But they've got no decent bowlers,\" said Raddleston.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Stephen.  \"Loman's not going to play for the Sixth.\nHe's sprained his wrist.\"\n\n\"Hip, hip, hurrah?\" yelled Paul, \"that _is_ jolly!  They are sure to be\nlicked now.  Are you sure he's out of it?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Look at him there with his arm in a sling.\"\n\nAnd Stephen pointed to where Loman stood in his ordinary clothes talking\nto some of his fellows.\n\n\"Well, that _is_ a piece of luck!\" said Paul.  \"Who's to take his\nplace?\"\n\n\"Baynes, they say.  He's no use, though.\"\n\n\"Don't you be too cock-sure, you two,\" growled Bramble.  \"I say we shall\nbeat you even if Loman don't play.  Got any brandy-balls left,\nGreenfield?\"\n\nSimilar speculations and hopes were being exchanged all round the field,\nand when at last the Fifth went out to field, and Callonby and Wren went\nin to bat for the Sixth, you might have heard a cat sneeze, so\nbreathless was the excitement.\n\nAmid solemn silence the first few balls were bowled.  The third ball of\nthe first over came straight on to Wren's bat, who played it neatly back\nto the bowler.  It was not a run, only a simple block; but it was the\nfirst play of the match, and so quite enough to loosen the tongues of\nall the small boys, who yelled, and howled, and cheered as frantically\nas if a six had been run or a wicket taken.  And the ice once broken,\nevery ball and every hit were marked and applauded as if empires\ndepended on them.\n\nIt was in the midst of this gradually rising excitement that Loman\nslipped quietly and unobserved from the scene, and betook himself to the\nerrand on which we accompanied him in the preceding chapter.\n\nThe two Sixth men went quickly to work, and at the end of the second\nover had scored eight.  Then Callonby, in stepping back to \"draw\" one of\nWraysford's balls, knocked down his wicket.\n\nHow the small boys yelled at this!\n\nBut the sight of Raleigh going in second soon silenced them.\n\n\"They mean hard work by sending in the captain now,\" said Paul.  \"I\ndon't like that!\"\n\n\"No more do I,\" said Stephen.  \"He always knocks Oliver's bowling\nabout.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother; is your brother bowling?\" said Master Paul, quite\nunconscious of wounding any one's feelings.  \"It's a pity they've got no\none better.\"\n\nStephen coloured up at this, and wondered what made Paul such a horrid\nboy.\n\n\"Better look-out for your eyes,\" said Bramble, cheerily.  \"The captain\nalways knocks up this way, over square-leg's head.\"\n\nThere was a general buzz of youngsters round the field, as the hero of\nthe school walked up to the wicket, and coolly turned to face Oliver's\nbowling.\n\nThe scorer in the tent hurriedly sharpened his pencil.  The big fellows,\nwho had been standing up to watch the opening overs, sat down on the\ngrass and made themselves comfortable.  Something was going to happen,\nevidently.  The captain was in, and meant business.\n\nOliver gripped the ball hard in his hand, and walked back to the end of\nhis run.  \"Play!\" cried the umpire, and amid dead silence the ball shot\nfrom the bowler's hand.\n\nNext moment there rose a shout loud enough to deafen all Saint\nDominic's.  The ball was flying fifty feet up in the air, and Raleigh\nwas slowly walking, bat in hand, back to the tent he had only a moment\nago quitted!\n\nThe captain had been clean bowled, first ball!\n\nWho shall describe the excitement, the yelling, the cheering, the\nconsternation that followed?  Paul got up and danced a hornpipe on the\nbench; Bramble kicked the boy nearest to him.  \"Well bowled, sir!\"\nshouted some.  \"Hard lines!\" screamed others.  \"Hurrah for the Fifth!\"\n\n\"You'll beat them yet, Sixth!\" such were a few of the shouts audible\nabove the general clamour.\n\nAs for Stephen, he was wild with joy.  He was a staunch partisan of the\nFifth in any case, but that was nothing to the fact that it was _his_\nbrother, his own brother and nobody else's, who had bowled that eventful\nball, and who was at that moment the hero of Saint Dominic's.  Stephen\nfelt as proud and elated as if he had bowled the ball himself, and could\nafford to be absolutely patronising to those around him, on the head of\nthis achievement.\n\n\"That wasn't a bad ball of Oliver's,\" he said to Paul.  \"He can bowl\nvery well when he tries.\"\n\n\"It was a beastly fluke!\" roared Bramble, determined to see no merit in\nthe exploit.\n\n\"Shut up and don't make a row,\" said Stephen, with a bland smile of\nforgiveness.\n\nBramble promised his adversary to shut _him_ up, and after a little more\ndiscussion and altercation and jubilation, the excitement subsided, and\nanother man went in.  All this while the Fifth were in ecstasies.  They\ncontrolled their feelings, however, contenting themselves with clapping\nOliver on the back till he was nearly dead, and speculating on the\nchances of beating their adversaries in a single innings.\n\nBut they had not won the match yet.\n\nWinter was next man in, and he and Wren fell to work very speedily in a\ndecidedly business-like way.  No big hits were made, but the score\ncrawled up by ones and twos steadily, and the longer they were at it the\nsteadier they played.  Loud cheers announced the posting of thirty on\nthe signal-board, but still the score went on.  Now it was a slip, now a\nbye, now a quiet cut.\n\n\"Bravo! well played!\" cried Raleigh and his men frequently.  The\ncaptain, by the way, was in excellent spirits, despite his misfortune.\n\nThirty-five, forty!  The Fifth began to look hot and puzzled.  The\nbatsmen were evidently far too much at home with the bowling.  A change\nmust be made, even though it be to put on only a second-rate bowler.\n\nTom Senior was put on.  He was nothing like as good a bowler as either\nWraysford, or Oliver, or Ricketts.  He bowled a very ordinary slow lob,\nwithout either twist or shoot, and was usually knocked about\nplentifully; and this appeared likely to be his fate now, for Wren got\nhold of his first ball, and knocked it right over into the scorer's tent\nfor five.  The Fifth groaned, and could have torn the wretched Tom to\npieces.  But the next ball was more lucky; Winter hit it, indeed, but he\nhit it up, sky-high, over the bowler's head, and before it reached the\nground Bullinger was safe underneath it.  It was with a sigh of relief\nthat the Fifth saw this awkward partnership broken up.  The score was at\nforty-eight for three wickets; quite enough too!\n\nAfter this the innings progressed more evenly.  Men came in and went out\nmore as usual, each contributing his three or four, and one or two their\nten or twelve.  Among the latter was Baynes, who, at the last moment, it\nwill be remembered, had been put into the eleven to replace Loman.  By\ncareful play he managed to put together ten, greatly to his own delight,\nand not a little to the surprise of his friends.\n\nIn due time the last wicket of the Sixth fell, to a total of eighty-four\nruns.\n\nThe small boys on the bench had had leisure to abate their ardour by\nthis time.  Bramble had recovered his spirits, and Paul and Stephen\nlooked a little blue as they saw the total signalled.\n\n\"Eighty-four's a lot,\" said Stephen.\n\nPaul nodded glumly.\n\n\"Ya, ha!  How do you like it, Guinea-pigs?\" jeered Bramble.  \"I hope\n_you'll_ get half as much.  _I_ knew how it would be.\"\n\nThe two friends listened to these taunts in silent sorrow, and wished\nthe next innings would begin.\n\nIt did presently, and not very brilliantly either.  The Fifth only\nmanaged to score fifty-one, and to this total Wraysford was the only\nplayer who made anything like good scoring.  Oliver got out for six,\nRicketts for nine, and Tom Senior and Braddy both for a \"duck's-egg.\"\nAltogether it was a meagre performance, and things looked very gloomy\nfor the Fifth when, for a second time, their adversaries took the\nwickets.\n\nThings never turn out at cricket as one expects, however, and the second\ninnings of the Sixth was no exception to the rule.  They only made\nthirty-six runs.  Stephen and Paul were hoarse with yelling, as first\none wicket, then another, went down for scarcely a run.  Raleigh and\nBaynes seemed the only two who could stand up at all to the bowling of\nOliver and Wraysford, but even their efforts could not keep the wickets\nup for long.\n\nEvery one saw now that the final innings would be a desperate struggle.\nThe Fifth wanted sixty-nine to be equal and seventy to win, and the\nquestion was, Would they do it in time?\n\nStephen and his confederate felt the weight of this question so\noppressive that they left the irritating company of Mr Bramble, and\nwalked off and joined themselves to a group of Fourth Form fellows, who\nwere watching the match with sulky interest, evidently sore that they\nhad none of their men in the School Eleven.\n\n\"They'll never do it, and serve them right!\" said one.  \"Why didn't they\nput Mansfield in the eleven, or Banks?  They're far more use than Fisher\nor Braddy.\"\n\n\"For all that, it'll be a sell if the Sixth lick,\" said another.\n\n\"I wouldn't much care.  If we are going to be sat upon by those Fifth\nsnobs every time an eleven is made up, it's quite time we did go in with\nthe Sixth.\"\n\n\"Jolly for the Sixth!\" retorted the other; whereupon Stephen laughed,\nand had his ears boxed for being cheeky.  The Fourth Senior could not\nstand \"cheek.\"\n\nBut Saint Dominic's generally was \"sweet\" on the Fifth, and hoped they\nwould win.  When, therefore, Tom Senior and Bullinger went in first and\nbegan to score there was great rejoicing.\n\nBut the Fourth Form fellows, among whom Stephen now was, refused to\ncheer for any one; criticism was more in their line.\n\n\"Did you ever see a fellow hit across wickets more horribly than\nSenior?\" said one.\n\n\"Just look at that!\" cried another.  \"That Bullinger's a downright muff\nnot to get that last ball to leg!  I could have got it easily.\"\n\n\"Well, with that bowling, it's a disgrace if they _don't_ score; that's\nall I can say,\" remarked a third.\n\nAnd so these Fourth Form grandees went on, much to Stephen's wrath, who,\nwhen Oliver went in, removed somewhere else, so as to be out of ear-shot\nof any offensive remarks.\n\nOliver, however, played so well that even the Fourth Form critics could\nhardly run him down.  He survived all the other wickets of his side,\nand, though not making a brilliant score, did what was almost as\nuseful--played steadily, and gradually demoralised the bowling of the\nenemy.\n\nAs the game went on the excitement increased rapidly; and when at length\nthe ninth wicket went down for sixty-one, and the last man in appeared,\nwith nine to win, the eagerness on both sides scarcely knew bounds.\nEvery ball, every piece of fielding, was cheered by one side, and every\nhit and every piece of play was as vehemently cheered by the other.  If\nRaleigh and Wren had been nervous bowlers, they would undoubtedly have\nbeen disconcerted by the dead silence, followed by terrific applause,\namid which every ball--even a wide--was delivered.  But happily they\nwere not.\n\nIt was at this critical juncture that Loman reappeared on the scene,\nmuch consoled to have the interview with Cripps over, and quite ready\nnow to hear every one lament his absence from the match.\n\nThe last man in was Webster, a small Fifth boy, who in the last innings\nhad signalised himself by making a duck's-egg.  The Fifth scarcely dared\nhope he would stay in long enough for the nine runs required to be made,\nand looked on now almost pale with anxiety.\n\n\"Now,\" said Pembury, near whom Loman, as well as our two Guinea-pigs,\nfound themselves, \"it all depends on Oliver, and I back Oliver to do it,\ndon't you, Loamy?\"\n\nLoman, who since the last _Dominican_ had not been on speaking terms\nwith Pembury, did not vouchsafe a reply, \"I do!\" said Stephen, boldly.\n\n\"Do you, really?\" replied Pembury, looking round at the boy.  \"Perhaps\nyou back yourself to talk when you're not spoken to, eh, Mr Greenhorn?\"\n\n\"Bravo! bravo!  Well run, sir!  Bravo, Fifth!\" was the cry as Oliver,\nfollowing up the first ball of the over, pilfered a bye from the\nlong-stop.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you!\" exclaimed Pembury, delighted; \"he'll save us; he's\ngot down to that end on purpose to take the bowling.  Do you twig,\nLoamy?  And he'll stick to that end till the last ball of the over, and\nthen he'll run an odd number, and get up to the other end.  Do you\ncomprehend?\"\n\n\"You seem to know all about it,\" growled Loman, who saw the force of\nPembury's observations, but greatly disliked it all the same.\n\n\"Do I, really?\" replied the lame boy; \"how odd that is, now--\nparticularly without a crib!\"\n\nLoman was fast losing patience--a fact which seemed to have anything but\na damping effect on the editor of the _Dominican_.  But another hit or\ntwo by Oliver created a momentary diversion.  It was quite clear that\nPembury's version of Oliver's tactics was a correct one.  He could\neasily have run three, but preferred to sacrifice a run rather than\nleave the incompetent and flurried Webster to face the bowling.\n\n\"Six to win!\" cried Stephen; \"I'm _certain_ Oliver will do it!\"\n\n\"Yes, Oliver was always a plodding old blockhead!\" drily observed\nPembury, who seemed to enjoy the small boy's indignation whenever any\none spoke disrespectfully of his big brother.\n\n\"He's not a blockhead!\" retorted Stephen, fiercely.\n\n\"Go it!  Come and kick my legs, young 'un; there's no one near but\nLoamy, and he can't hurt.\"\n\n\"Look here, you lame little wretch!\" exclaimed Loman, in a passion; \"if\nI have any more of your impudence I'll box your ears!\"\n\n\"I thought your wrist was sprained?\" artlessly observed Pembury.  \"Here,\nyoung Paul, let's get behind you, there's a good fellow, I _am_ in such\na funk!\"\n\nWhether Loman would have carried out his threat or not is doubtful, but\nat that moment a terrific shout greeted another hit by Oliver--the best\nhe had made during the match--for which he ran four.  One to tie, two to\nwin! will they do it?\n\nIt was a critical moment for Saint Dominic's.  Had the two batsmen been\nplaying for their lives they could not have been more anxiously watched;\neven Pembury became silent.\n\nAnd now the last ball of the over is bowled in dead silence.  Onlookers\ncan even hear the whizz with which it leaves Wren's hand.\n\nIt is almost wide, but Oliver steps out to it and just touches it.\nWebster is half across the wickets already--ready for a bye.  Oliver\ncalls to him to come on, and runs.  It is a desperate shave--too\ndesperate for good play.  But who cares for that when that run has\npulled the two sides level, and when, best of all, Oliver has got up to\nthe proper end for the next over?\n\nEqual!  What a shout greets the announcement!  But it dies away\nsuddenly, and a new anxious silence ensues.  The game is saved, but not\nwon; another run is wanted.\n\nNo one says a word, but the Fifth everywhere look on with a confidence\nwhich is far more eloquent than words.\n\nRaleigh is the bowler from the lower end, and the Sixth send out their\nhearts to him.  He may save them yet!\n\nHe runs, in his usual unconcerned manner, up to the wicket and delivers\nthe ball.  It is one which there is but one way of playing--among the\nslips.\n\nOliver understands it evidently, and, to the joy of the Fifth, plays it.\nBut why does their cheer drop suddenly, and why in a moment is it\ndrowned, over and over and over again, by the cheers of the Sixth and\ntheir partisans, as the crowd suddenly breaks into the field, and the\nball shoots high up in the air?\n\nA catch!  Baynes, the odd man, had missed a chance a few overs back from\nstanding too deep.  This time he had crept in close, and saved the Sixth\nby one of the neatest low-catches that had ever been seen in a Dominican\nmatch.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. A LOWER SCHOOL FESTIVAL.\n\n\"I tell you what, Wray,\" said Oliver one evening about a week after the\nmatch, \"I heartily wish this term was over.\"\n\n\"Why, that's just what I heard your young brother say.  He is going to\nlearn the bicycle, he says, in the holidays.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not the holidays I want,\" said Oliver.  \"But somehow things\nhave gone all wrong.  I've been off my luck completely this term.\"\n\n\"Off your luck!--You great discontented, ungrateful bear.  Haven't you\ngot the English prize?  Aren't you in the School Eleven? and didn't you\nmake top score in the match with the Sixth last Saturday?  Whatever do\nyou mean by `off your luck'?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not that, you know,\" said Oliver, pulling a quill pen to bits.\n\"What I mean is--oh, bother!--a fellow can't explain it.\"\n\n\"So it seems,\" laughed Wraysford; \"but I wish a fellow could, for I've\nnot a notion what you're driving at.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean I'm not doing much good.  There's that young brother of\nmine, for instance.  What good have I been to him?  There have I let him\ngo and do just what he likes, and not looked after him a bit ever since\nhe came here.\"\n\n\"And I wager he's got on all the better for not being tied up to your\napron strings.  He's a fine honest little chap, is young Greenfield.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say; but somehow I don't seem to know as much of him now as\nI used to do before he came here.\"\n\n\"That's Loman's fault, I bet you anything,\" exclaimed Wraysford.  \"I'm\nsure he won't do the kid any good.  But Rastle was saying only yesterday\nhow well Stephen was getting on in class.\"\n\n\"Was he?  It's little thanks to me if he is,\" said Oliver, gloomily.\n\n\"And what else have you got to grumble about?\" asked his friend.\n\n\"Why, you know how I'm out with the Fifth over that affair with Loman.\nThey all set me down as a coward, and I'm not that.\"\n\n\"Of course you aren't,\" warmly replied the other.  \"But, Noll, you told\nme a little while ago you didn't care a snap what they thought.\"\n\n\"No more I do, in a way.  But it's very uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Why don't you tell them straight out why you didn't let out at Loman?\nThey are sure to respect your motive.\"\n\n\"Yes, and set me down as posing as a martyr or a saint!  No!  I'd sooner\npass as a coward than set up as a saint when I'm not one.  Why, Wray, if\nyou'll believe me, I've been a worse Christian since I began to try to\nbe one, than I ever was before.  I'm for ever losing my temper, and--\"\n\n\"Shut up that tune, now,\" interposed Wraysford, hurriedly.  \"If you are\nbeginning at that again, I'll go.  As if you didn't know you were the\nbest fellow in the school!\"\n\n\"I'm not the best, _or_ anything like,\" said Oliver, warmly; \"I hate\nyour saying so--I wish almost I had never told you anything about it.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said Wraysford, walking to the window and looking\nout.  \"Ever since you told me of it, I've been trying myself in a mild\nway to go straight.  But it's desperate hard work.\"\n\n\"Desperate hard work even if you try in more than a mild way,\" said\nOliver.\n\nBoth were silent for a little, and then Oliver, hurriedly changing the\nsubject, said, \"And then, to proceed with my growl, I'm certain to come\na howler over the Nightingale.\"\n\nWraysford turned from the window with a laugh.\n\n\"I suppose you expect me to sympathise with you about that, eh?  The\nbigger the howler the better for me!  I only wish you were a true\nprophet, Noll, in that particular.\"\n\n\"Why, of course you'll beat me--and if you don't Loman will.  I hear\nhe's grinding away like nuts.\"\n\n\"Is he, though?\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"Yes, and he's going to get a `coach' in the holidays too.\"\n\n\"More likely a dog-cart.  Anyhow, I dare say he will run us close.  But\nhe's such a shifty fellow, there's no knowing whether he will stay out.\"\n\nJust at that moment a terrific row came up from below.\n\n\"Whatever's up down there?\"\n\n\"Only the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles.  By the way,\" said Wraysford,\n\"they've got a grand `supper,' as they call it, on to-night to celebrate\ntheir cricket match.  Suppose we go and see the fun?\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Oliver.  \"Who won the match?\"\n\n\"Why, what a question!  Do you suppose a match between Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles _ever_ came to an end?  They had a free fight at the end of the\nfirst innings.  The Tadpole umpire gave one of his own men `not out'\nwhen he hit his wicket, and they made a personal question of it, and\nfell out.  Your young brother, I hear, greatly distinguished himself in\nthe argument.\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't seem to interfere with their spirits now, to judge of\nthe row they are making.  Just listen!\"\n\nBy this time they had reached the door of the Fourth Junior room, whence\nproceeded a noise such as one often hears in a certain popular\ndepartment of the Zoological Gardens.  Amid the tumult and hubbub the\ntwo friends had not much difficulty in slipping in unobserved and\nseating themselves comfortably in an obscure corner of the festive\napartment, behind a pyramid of piled-up chairs and forms.\n\nThe Junior \"cricket feast\" was an institution in Saint Dominic's, and\nwas an occasion when any one who had nerves to be excruciated or\near-drums to be broken took care to keep out of the way.  In place of\nthe usual desks and forms, a long table ran down the room, round which\nsome fifty or sixty urchins sat, regaling themselves with what was left\nof a vast spread of plum-cake, buns, and ginger-beer.  How these\nbanquets were provided was always a mystery to outsiders.  Some said a\nlevy of threepence a head was made; others, that every boy was bound in\nhonour to contribute something eatable to the feast; and others averred\nthat every boy had to bring his own bag and bottle, and no more.  Be\nthat as it might, the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles at present assembled\nlooked uncommonly tight about the jackets after it all, and not one had\nthe appearance of actual starvation written on his lineaments.\n\nThe animal part of the feast, however, was now over, and the\nintellectual was beginning.  The tremendous noise which had brought\nOliver and Wraysford on to the scene had indeed been but the applause\nwhich followed the chairman's opening song--a musical effort which was\nimperatively encored by a large and enthusiastic audience.\n\nThe chairman, by the way, was no other than our friend Bramble, who by\nreason of seniority--he had been two years in the Fourth Junior, and\nshowed no signs of rising higher all his life--claimed to preside on all\nsuch occasions.  He sat up at the top end in stately glory, higher than\nthe rest by the thickness of a Liddell and Scott, which was placed on\nhis chair to lift him up to the required elevation, blushingly receiving\nthe applause with which his song was greeted, and modestly volunteering\nto sing it again if the fellows liked.\n\nThe fellows did like.  Mr Bramble mounted once more on to the seat of\nhis chair, and saying, \"Look-out for the chorus!\" began one of the\ntime-honoured Dominican cricket songs.  It consisted of about twelve\nverses altogether, but three will be quite enough for the reader.\n\n  \"There was a little lad,\n  (Well bowled!)\n  And a little bat he had;\n  (Well bowled!)\n  He skipped up to the wicket,\n  And thought he'd play some cricket,\n  But he didn't, for he was--\n  Well bowled!\n\n  \"He thought he'd make a score\n  (So bold),\n  And lead-off with a four\n  (So bold);\n  So he walked out to a twister,\n  But somehow sort of missed her,\n  And she bailed him, for he was\n  Too bold.\n\n  \"Now all ye little boys\n  (So bold),\n  Who like to make a noise\n  (So bold),\n  Take warning by young Walker,\n  Keep your bat down to a yorker,\n  Or, don't you see? you'll be--\n  Well bowled!\"\n\nThe virtue of the pathetic ballad was in the chorus, which was usually\nnot sung, but spoken, and so presented a noble opportunity for variety\nof tone and expression, which was greedily seized upon by the riotous\nyoung gentlemen into whose mouths it was entrusted.  By the time the sad\nadventures of Master Walker had been rehearsed in all their twelve\nverses, the meeting was so hoarse that to the two elder boys it seemed\nas if the proceedings must necessarily come abruptly to a close for want\nof voice.\n\nBut no!  If the meeting was for the moment incapable of song, speech was\nyet possible and behold there arose Master Paul in his place to propose\na toast.\n\nNow Master Paul was a Guinea-pig, and accounted a mighty man in his\ntribe.  Any one might have supposed that the purpose for which he had\nnow risen was to propose in complimentary terms the health of his\ngallant opponents the Tadpoles.  This, however, was far from his\nintention.  His modesty had another theme.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he\nbegan.  There were no ladies present, but that didn't matter.\nTremendous cheers greeted this opening.  \"You all know me; I am one of\nyourselves.\"  Paul had borrowed this expression from the speech of a\nRadical orator, which had appeared recently in the papers.  Every one\nknew it was borrowed, for he had asked about twenty of his friends\nduring the last week whether that wouldn't be \"a showy lead-off for his\ncricket feast jaw?\"\n\nThe quotation was, however, now greeted as vociferously as if it had\nbeen strictly original, and shouts of \"So you are!\"\n\n\"Bravo, Paul!\" for a while drowned the orator's voice.  When silence was\nrestored his eloquence took a new and unexpected departure.  \"Jemmy\nWelch, I'll punch your head when we get outside, see if I don't!\"  Jemmy\nWelch was a Guinea-pig who had just made a particularly good shot at the\nspeaker's nose with a piece of plum-cake.  \"Now, ladies and gentlemen, I\nshall not detain you with a speech (loud cheers from all, and `Jolly\ngood job!' from Bramble).  I shall go on speaking just as long as I\nchoose, Bramble, so now!  (Cheers.)  I've as much right to speak as you\nhave.  (Applause.)  You're only a stuck-up duffer.  (Terrific cheers,\nand a fight down at the end of the table.)  I beg to drink the health of\nthe Guinea-pigs.  (Loud Guinea-pig cheers.)  We licked the old Tadpoles\nin the match.  (`No you didn't!'  `That's a cram!' and groans from the\nTadpoles.)  I say we did!  Your umpire was a cheat--they always are!  We\nbeat you hollow, didn't we, Stee Greenfield?\"\n\n\"Yes, rather!\" shouted Stephen, snatching a piece of cake away from a\nTadpole and shying it to a Guinea-pig.\n\n\"That's eight matches we've won,\" proceeded Paul; \"and--all right,\nSpicer!  I saw you do it this time!  See if I don't pay you for it!\"\nwhereat the speaker hurriedly quitted his seat and, amid howls and\nyells, proceeded to \"pay out\" Spicer.\n\nMeanwhile Stephen heard his name suddenly called upon for a song, an\ninvitation he promptly obeyed.  But as the clamour was at the time\ndeafening, and the attention of the audience was wholly monopolised by\nthe commercial transactions taking place between Paul and Spicer, the\neffect of the performance was somewhat lost.  Oliver certainly did see\nhis young brother mount up on the table, turn very red in the face, open\nhis mouth and shut it, smile in one part, look sorrowful in another, and\nwave his hand above his head in another.  But that was the only\nintimation he had of a musical performance proceeding.  Words and tune\nwere utterly inaudible by any one except the singer himself--even if\n_he_ heard them.\n\nThis was getting monotonous, and the two visitors were thinking of\nwithdrawing, when the door suddenly opened, and a dead silence\nprevailed.  The new-comer was the dirtiest and most ferocious-looking of\nall the boys in the lower school, who rushed into the room breathless,\nand in what would have been a white heat had his face been clean enough\nto show it.  \"What do you think?\" he gasped, catching hold of the back\nof a chair for support; \"Tony Pembury's kept me all this while brushing\nhis clothes!  I told him it was cricket feast, but he didn't care!  What\ndo you think of that?  Of course, you've finished all the grub; I knew\nyou would!\"\n\nThis last plaintive wail of disappointment was drowned in the clamour of\nexecration which greeted the boy's announcement.  Lesser feuds were\ninstantly forgotten in presence of this great insult.  The most sacred\ntraditions of Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were being trampled upon by the\ntyrants of the upper school!  Not even on cricket feast night was a fag\nto be let off fagging!\n\nIt was enough!  The last straw breaks the camel's back, and the young\nDominicans had now reached the point of desperation.\n\nIt was long before silence enough could be restored, and then the\nredoubtable Spicer yelled out, \"Let's strike!\"\n\nThe cry was taken up with yells of enthusiasm--\"Strike!  No more\nfagging!\"\n\n\"Any boy who fags after this,\" screamed Bramble, \"will be cut dead!\nThose who promise hold up your hands--mind, it's a promise!\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the temper of the meeting, every hand in the room\nwas held up.\n\n\"Mind now, no giving in!\" cried Paul.  \"Let's stick all together.\nGreenfield senior shall _kill_ me before I do anything more for him!\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" whispered Oliver, laughing; \"what a lot of martyrdoms\nhe'll have to put up with!\"\n\n\"And Pembury shall kill me,\" squealed the last comer, who had comforted\nhimself with several crusts of plum-cakes and the dregs of about a dozen\nbottles of ginger-beer.  And every one protested their willingness to\ndie in the good cause.\n\nAt this stage Oliver and Wraysford withdrew unobserved.  \"I'm afraid\nwe've been eavesdropping,\" said Oliver.  \"Anyhow, I don't mean to take\nadvantage of what I've heard.\"\n\n\"What a young ruffian your brother is!\" said Wraysford; \"he looked\ntremendously in earnest!\"\n\n\"Yes, he always is.  You'll find he'll keep his word far better than\nmost of them.\"\n\n\"If he does, I'm afraid Loman will make it unpleasant for him,\" said\nWraysford.\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to interfere.\"\n\n\"Why, what a bloodthirsty chap you are, Wray!  You are longing for me to\nquarrel with Loman.  I'll wait till young Stephen asks me to.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will?  He's a proud little chap.\"\n\nOliver laughed.  \"It'll serve him right if he does get a lesson.  Did\never you see such a lot of young cannibals as those youngsters?  Are you\ncoming to have supper with me?\"\n\nThe nine o'clock bell soon rang, and, as usual, Oliver went to his door\nand shouted for Paul.\n\nNo Paul came.\n\nHe shouted again and again, but the fag did not appear.  \"They mean\nbusiness,\" he said.  \"What shall I do?  Paul!\"\n\nThis time there came a reply down the passage--\"Shan't come!\"\n\n\"Ho, he!\" said Oliver; \"this is serious; they are sticking to their\nstrike with a vengeance!  I suppose I must go and look for my fag, eh,\nWray?  Discipline must be maintained.\"\n\nSo saying, Oliver stepped out into the passage and strolled off in the\ndirection from which the rebel's voice had proceeded.  The passages were\nempty; only in the Fourth Junior room was there a sound of clamour.\n\nOliver went to the door; it was shut.  He pushed; it was fortified.  He\nkicked on it; a defiant howl greeted him from the inside.  He called\naloud on his fag; another \"Shan't come!\" was his only answer.\n\nIt was getting past a joke, and Oliver's temper was, as we have seen not\nof the longest.  He kicked again, angrily, and ordered Paul to appear.\n\nThe same answer was given, accompanied with the same yell, and Oliver's\ntemper went faster than ever.  He forgot he was making himself\nridiculous; he forgot he was only affording a triumph to those whom he\ndesired to punish; he forgot the good resolutions which had held him\nback on a former occasion, and, giving way to sudden rage, kicked\ndesperately at the door once more.\n\nThis time his forcible appeal had some effect.  The lower panel of the\ndoor gave way before the blow and crashed inwards, leaving a breach\nlarge enough to admit a football.\n\nIt was an unlucky piece of success for Oliver, for next moment he felt\nhis foot grabbed by half a dozen small hands within and held firmly,\nrendering him unable to stir from his ridiculous position.  In vain he\nstruggled and raged; he was a tight prisoner, at the mercy of his\ncaptors.\n\nIt was all he could do to stand on his one foot, clinging wildly to the\nhandle of the door.  In this dignified attitude Wraysford presently\nfound his friend, and in such a state of passion and fury as he had\nnever before seen him.\n\nTo rap the array of inky knuckles inside with a ruler, and so disengage\nthe captive foot, was the work of a minute.  Oliver stood for a moment\nfacing the door and trembling with anger, but Wraysford, taking him\ngently by the arm, said, \"Come along, old boy!\"\n\nThere was something in his voice and look which brought a sudden flush\ninto the pale face of the angry Oliver.  Without a word, he turned from\nthe door and accompanied his friend back to the study.  There were no\nlong talks, no lectures, no remorseful confessions that evening.  The\ntwo talked perhaps less than usual, and when they did it was about\nordinary school topics.\n\nNo reference was made either then or for a long while afterwards to the\nevents of the evening.  And yet Oliver and Wraysford, somehow, seemed\nmore than ever drawn together, and to understand one another better\nafter this than had ever been the case before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16. GUINEA-PIGS AND TADPOLES ON STRIKE.\n\nIf anything had been required to make the \"strike\" of the Guinea-pigs\nand Tadpoles a serious matter, the \"affair of Greenfield senior's right\nfoot\" undoubtedly had that effect.  The _eclat_ which that heroic\nexploit lent to the mutiny was simply marvellous.  The story was told\nwith fifty exaggerations all over the school.  One report said that the\nwhole body of the monitors had besieged the Fourth Junior door, and had\nbeen repulsed with heavy slaughter.  Another declared that Oliver had\nbeen captured by the fags, and branded on the soles of his feet with a G\nand a T, to commemorate the emancipation of the Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles; and a third veracious narrative went so far as to say that the\nUpper Fifth and several members of the Sixth had humbly come and begged\nforgiveness for their past misdeeds, and were henceforth to become the\nfags of their late victims.\n\nTrue or untrue as these stories were, any amount of glory accompanied\nthe beginning of the strike, and there was sufficient sense of common\ndanger to unite the youngsters in very close bonds.  You rarely caught a\nGuinea-pig or a Tadpole alone now; they walked about in dozens, and were\nvery wide awake.  They assembled on every possible occasion in their\nroom, and fortified their door with chairs and desks, and their zeal\nwith fiery orations and excited conjurations.  One wretched youth who\nthe first evening had been weak enough to poke his master's fire, was\nexpelled ignominiously from the community, and for a week afterwards\nlived the life of an outcast in Saint Dominic's.  The youngsters were in\nearnest, and no mistake.  Stephen Greenfield, as was only natural, did\nnot altogether find cause for exultation over the event which led to the\nstrike.  For a whole day he was very angry on his brother's account, and\nthreatened to stand aloof from the revolution altogether; but when it\nwas explained to him this would lead to a general \"smash-up\" of the\nstrike, and when it was further explained that the fellows who caught\nhold of his big brother's right foot couldn't possibly be expected to\nknow to whom that foot belonged, he relented, and entered as\nenthusiastically as any one into the business.  Indeed, if all the\nrebels had been like Stephen, the fags at Saint Dominic's would be on\nstrike to this day.  He contemplated martyrdom with the utmost\nequanimity, and the Inquisition itself never saw a more determined\nvictim.\n\nThe morning after the famous \"cricket feast\" gave him his first\nopportunity of sacrificing himself for the good of his country.  Loman\nmet him in the passage after first-class.\n\n\"Why didn't you turn up and get my breakfast, you idle young vagabond?\"\ninquired the Sixth Form boy, half good-humouredly, and little guessing\nwhat was in the wind.  \"I'm not idle,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Then what do you mean by not doing your work?\"\n\n\"It's not my work.\"\n\nLoman opened his eyes in amazement, and stared at this bold young hero\nas if he had dropped from the clouds.  \"What!\" he cried; \"what do you\nsay?\"\n\n\"It's not my work,\" repeated Stephen, blushing, but very determined.\n\n\"Look here, young fellow,\" said Loman, when he was sure that he had\nreally heard correctly, \"don't you play any of your little games with\nme, or you'll be sorry for it.\"\n\nStephen said nothing, and waited with a tremor for what was to follow.\n\nLoman was hardly a bully naturally.  It was always easier for him to be\ncivil than to be angry, especially with small boys, but this cool\ndefiance on the part of his fag was too much for any one's civility, and\nLoman began to be angry.\n\n\"What do you mean by it?\" he said, catching the boy by the arm.\n\nStephen wrenched away his arm and stood dogged and silent.\n\nNothing could have irritated Loman more.  To be defied and resisted by a\nyoungster like this was an experience quite new to him.\n\n\"Just come to my room,\" said he, gripping his fag angrily by the\nshoulder.  \"We'll see who's master of us two!\"\n\nStephen was forced to submit, and allowed himself to be dragged to the\nstudy.\n\n\"Now!\" said Loman shutting the door.\n\n\"Now!\" said Stephen, as boldly as he could, and wondering what on earth\nwas to become of him.\n\n\"Are you going to do what you're told, or not?\" demanded Loman.\n\n\"Not what _you_ tell me,\" replied Stephen, promptly, but not exactly\ncheerfully.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Loman, his face becoming crimson, \"you're quite sure?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Then take that!\" said Loman.\n\nIt was a sharp box on the ears, suddenly administered.  Stephen recoiled\na moment, but only a moment.  He had expected something a good deal\nworse.  If that was all, he would brave it out yet.\n\n\"Don't you hit me!\" he said, defiantly.\n\nLoman could not stand to be defied.  His vanity was his weak point, and\nnothing offended his vanity so much as to find any one as determined as\nhimself.\n\nHe took up a ruler, and in his passion flung it at the luckless\nStephen's head.  It struck him hard on the cheek.  The blood flushed to\nthe boy's face as he stood a moment half-stunned and smarting with the\npain, confronting his adversary.  Then he rushed blindly in and flung\nhimself upon the bully.\n\nOf course it was no match.  The small boy was at the mercy of the big\none.  The latter was indeed taken aback for a moment at the fury of his\nyoung assailant, impotent as it was, but that was all.  He might have\ndefended himself with a single hand; he might have carried the boy under\none arm out into the passage.  But the evil spirit had been roused\nwithin him, and that spirit knew no mercy.  He struck out and fought his\nlittle foeman as if he had been one of his own size and strength.  For\nevery wild, feeble blow Stephen aimed, Loman aimed a hard and straight\nblow back.  If Stephen wavered, Loman followed in as he would in a\nprofessional boxing match, and when at last the small boy gave up,\nexhausted, bleeding, and scarcely able to stand, his foe administered a\nparting blow, which, if he had struck no other, would have stamped him\nas a coward for ever.\n\n\"Now!\" exclaimed Loman, looking down on his victim, \"will you do what\nyou're told now, eh?\"\n\nIt was a critical moment for poor Stephen.  After all, was the \"strike\"\nworth all this hardship?  A single word would have saved him; whereas if\nhe again defied his enemy, it was all up with him.\n\nHe did waver a moment; and lucky for him he did.  For just then the door\nopened, and Simon entered.  Stephen saw his chance.  Slipping to the\nopen door, he mustered up energy to cry as loud as he could, \"No, I\nwon't;\" and with that made good his escape into the passage, as done up\nas a small boy well could be without being quite floored.\n\nA dozen eager friends were at hand to aid in stopping the bleeding of\ntheir hero's nose, and to apply raw steak to his black eye.  The story\nof his desperate encounter flew on the wings of fame all over the\nschool, and the glory and pride of the youngsters reached its climax\nwhen, that afternoon, Stephen with his face all on one side, his eye a\nbright green and yellow, and his under lip about twice its ordinary\nthickness, took his accustomed place in the arithmetic class of the\nFourth Junior.\n\n\"Why, Greenfield,\" exclaimed Mr Rastle, when in due time the young\nhero's turn came to stand up and answer a question, \"what have you been\ndoing to yourself?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" remarked Stephen, mildly.\n\n\"How did you come by that black eye?\" asked the master.\n\n\"Fighting, sir,\" said Stephen, rather pompously.\n\n\"Ah! what did you say forty-eight sixths was equal to?\"\n\nThis was Mr Rastle's way.  He very rarely hauled a boy over the coals\nbefore the whole class.\n\nBut after the lesson he beckoned Stephen into his study.\n\n\"I'm afraid you got the worst of that fight,\" he said.\n\nStephen, who by this time knew Mr Rastle too well to be afraid of him,\nand too well, also, not to be quite frank with him, answered meekly,\n\"The fellow was bigger than me.\"\n\n\"I should guess that by the state of your face.  Now, I don't want to\nknow what the fight was about, though I dare say you'd like to tell me\n[Stephen was boiling to tell him].  You small boys have such peculiar\nreasons for fighting, you know, no one can understand them.\"\n\n\"But this was because--\"\n\n\"Hush!  Didn't I tell you I won't hear what it was about, sir!\" said Mr\nRastle, sharply.  \"Did you shake hands afterwards?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, _and I won't_!\" exclaimed Stephen, forgetting, in his\nindignation, to whom he was speaking.\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr Rastle, quietly, \"write me out one hundred lines of\nCaesar, Greenfield; and when you have recollected how to behave\nyourself, we will talk more about this.  You can go.\"\n\nMr Rastle _was_ a queer man; he never took things as one expected.\nWhen Stephen expected him to be furious he was as mild as a lamb.  There\nwas no making him out.\n\nBut this was certain: Stephen left his room a good deal more crestfallen\nthan he entered it.  He had hoped to win Mr Rastle's sympathy and\nadmiration by an account of his grievances, and, instead of that, he was\nsent off in disgrace, with an imposition for being rude, and feeling\nanything but a hero.\n\nEven the applause of his friends failed to console him quite.  Besides,\nhis head ached badly, and the bruise on his cheek, which he had scarcely\nfelt among his other wounds, now began to swell and grow painful.\nAltogether, he was in the wars.\n\nHe was groaning over his imposition late that evening in the class-room,\nfeeling in dreadful dumps, and wishing he had never come to Saint\nDominic's, when a hand laid on his shoulder made him start.  He looked\nup and saw Mr Rastle.\n\n\"Greenfield,\" said the master, kindly, \"how much of your imposition have\nyou done?\"\n\n\"Seventy lines, sir.\"\n\n\"Hum!  That will do this time.  You had better get to bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" exclaimed Stephen, moved far more by Mr Rastle's kind tone\nthan by his letting him off thirty lines of the Caesar, \"I'm so sorry I\nwas rude to you.\"\n\n\"Well, I was sorry, too; so we'll say no more about that.  Why, what a\ncrack you must have got on your cheek!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; that was the ruler did that.\"\n\n\"The ruler!  Then it wasn't a fair fight?  Now don't begin telling me\nall about it.  I dare say you were very heroic, and stood up against\nterrible odds.  But you've a very black eye and a very sore cheek now,\nso you had better get to bed as fast as you can.\"\n\nAnd certainly the pale, bruised, upturned face of the boy did not look\nvery bright at that moment.\n\nStephen Greenfield went off to bed that night in a perturbed state of\nmind and body.  He had stuck loyally to his promise not to fag, and he\nhad earned the universal admiration of his comrades.  But, on the other\nhand, he had been awfully knocked about, and, almost as bad, he had been\neffectively snubbed by Mr Rastle.  He did not exactly know what to\nthink of it all.  Had he done a fine deed or a foolish one? and what\nought he to do to-morrow?\n\nLike a sensible little man, he went sound asleep over these questions,\nand forgot all about them till the morrow.\n\nWhen he woke Stephen was like a giant refreshed.  His eye was certainly\na rather more brilliant yellow than the day before, and his cheek still\nwore a dull red flush.  But somehow he felt none of the misgivings and\ndumps that had oppressed him the night before.  He was full of hope\nagain and full of courage.  The Guinea-pigs should never charge _him_\nwith treachery and desertion, and what he had gone through already in\nthe \"good cause\" he would go through again.\n\nWith this determination he dressed and went down to school.  Loman,\nwhose summons he expected every moment to hear, did not put him to the\nnecessity of a renewed struggle.  From all quarters, too, encouraging\nreports came in from the various insurgents.  Paul announced that\nGreenfield senior took it \"like a lamb\"; Bramble recounted how his\n\"nigger-driver,\" as he was pleased to call Wren, had chased him twice\nround the playground and over the top of the cricket-shed without being\nable to capture him; and most of the others had exploits equally heroic\nto boast of.  Things were looking up in the Fourth Junior.\n\nThey spent a merry morning, these young rebels, wondering in whispers\nover their lessons what this and that Sixth or Fifth Form fellow had\ndone without them.  With great glee they imagined Raleigh blacking his\nown boots and Pembury boiling his own eggs, and the very idea of such\nwonders quite frightened them.  At that rate Saint Dominic's would come\nto a standstill altogether.\n\n\"Serve 'em right!\" said Bramble; \"they want a lesson.  I wish I'd two\nfellows to strike against instead of one!\"\n\n\"One's enough if he strikes you back,\" said Stephen, with a rueful grin.\n\nMaster Bramble evinced his sympathy by laughing aloud.  \"I say, you look\njust like a clown; doesn't he, Padger, with his eye all sorts of colours\nand his cheek like a house on fire?\"\n\n\"All very well,\" said Stephen; \"I wish you'd got my cheek.\"\n\n\"Bramby's got cheek enough of his own, I guess,\" put in Paul; whereat\nMaster Bramble fired up, and a quarrel became imminent.\n\nHowever, Stephen prevented it by calling back attention to his own\npicturesque countenance.  \"I don't mind the eye, that don't hurt; but I\ncan tell you, you fellows, my cheek's awful!\"\n\n\"I always said you'd got an awful cheek of your own, young Greenfield,\"\nsaid Bramble, laughing, as if _he_ was the inventor of the joke.\nStephen glowered at him.\n\n\"Well, you said so yourself,\" put in Bramble, a little mildly, for since\nStephen's exploit yesterday that young hero had advanced a good deal in\nthe respect of his fellows.  \"But, I say, why don't you stick some\nlotion or something on it?  It'll never get right if you don't, will it,\nPadger?\"\n\nPadger suggested that young Greenfield might possibly have to have his\ncheek cut off if he didn't look-out, and Paul said the sooner he\n\"stashed his cheek\" the better.\n\nThe result of this friendly and witty conference was that Stephen took\nit into his head to cure his cheek, and to that end applied for leave\nfrom Mr Rastle to go down that afternoon to Maltby to get something\nfrom the chemist.\n\nMr Rastle gave him leave, and told him the best sort of lotion to ask\nfor, and so, as soon as afternoon school was over, our young champion\nsallied boldly forth on his errand.  He felt very self-satisfied and\nforgiving to all the world as he walked along.  There was no doubt about\nit, he was a hero.  Every one seemed to take an interest in his black\neye and sore cheek, from Mr Rastle downwards.  Very likely that fight\nof his with Loman yesterday would be recorded as long as Saint Dominic's\nremained, as the event which saved the lower school from the tyranny of\nthe upper!\n\nHis way to the chemist's lay past the turning up to the Cockchafer, and\nthe idea occurred to him to turn in on the way back and talk over the\nevent of the hour with Mr Cripps, whom he had not seen since the\nbagatelle-lesson a week ago.  He was sure that good gentleman would\nsympathise with him, and most likely praise him; and in any case it\nwould be only civil, after promising to come and see him sometimes, to\nlook in.\n\nThe only thing was that the Cockchafer, whatever one might say about it,\nwas a public-house.  The private door at the side hardly sufficed to\nsatisfy Stephen that he was not breaking rules by going in.  He would\nnot have entered by the public door for worlds, and the thought did\noccur to him, Was there very much difference after all between one door\nand the other?  However, he had not answered the question before he\nfound himself inside, shaking hands with Mr Cripps.\n\nThat gentleman was of course delighted, and profuse in his gratitude to\nthe \"young swell\" for looking him up.  He listened with profound\ninterest and sympathy to his story, and made some very fierce remarks\nabout what he would do to \"that there\" Loman if he got hold of him.\nThen the subject of bagatelle happened to come up, and presently Stephen\nwas again delighting and astonishing the good gentleman by his skill in\nthat game.  Then in due time it came out that the boy's mother had\nbought him a bicycle, and he was going to learn in the holidays, a\nresolution Mr Cripps highly approved of, and was certain a clever young\nfellow like him would learn in no time, which greatly pleased Stephen.\n\nBefore parting, Mr Cripps insisted on lending his young friend a\nlantern for his bicycle, when he rode it in the dark.  It was a\nspecially good one, he said, and the young gentleman could easily return\nit to him after the holidays, and so on.\n\nAltogether it was a delightful visit, and Stephen wondered more than\never how some of the fellows could think ill of Mr Cripps.\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" said the boy, at parting; \"don't do what you said you would\nto Loman.  I'm not afraid of him, you know.\"\n\n\"I'd like to knock his ugly head off for him!\" cried Mr Cripps,\nindignantly.\n\n\"No, don't; please don't!  I'd rather not.  I dare say he's sorry for\nit.\"\n\n\"I'll see he is!\" growled Mr Cripps.\n\n\"Besides, I've forgiven him,\" said Stephen, \"and oughtn't to have told\ntales of him; so mind you don't do it, Mr Cripps, will you?\"\n\n\"I'll see,\" said Mr Cripps.  \"Good-bye for the present, young\ngentleman, and come again soon.\"\n\nAnd so, at peace with all the world, and particularly with himself,\nStephen strolled back to Saint Dominic's, whistling merrily.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17. THE DOCTOR AMONG THE GUINEA-PIGS.\n\nThe _Dominican_ appeared once more before the holidays, and, as might\nhave been expected (besides its usual articles at the expense of the\nSixth Form), made itself particularly merry over the rebellion of the\nGuinea-pigs and Tadpoles.\n\nPembury was not the fellow to give quarter in his own particular line of\nattack; and it must be confessed he had the proud satisfaction of making\nhis unfortunate young victims smart.\n\nThe \"leading article\" of the present number bore the suggestive title,\n\"Thank Goodness!\" and began as follows:\n\n\"Thank goodness, we are at last rid of the pest which has made Saint\nDominic's hideous for months past!  At a single blow, with a single clap\nof the hands, we have sent Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles packing, and can now\nbreathe pure air.  No longer shall we have to put up with the plague.\nWe are to be spared the disgust of seeing them, much more of talking to\nthem or hearing their hideous voices.  No longer will our morning milk\nbe burned; no longer will our herrings be grilled to cinders; no longer\nwill our jam be purloined; no longer will our books and door-handles be\nmade abominable by contact with their filthy hands!  Thank goodness!\nThe Doctor never did a more patriotic deed than this!  The small animals\nare in future to be kept to their own quarters, and will be forbidden\nthe liberty they have so long abused of mixing with their betters.  It\nis as well for all parties; and if any event could have brightened the\nlast days of this term, it is this--\" and so on.\n\nBefore this manifesto, a swarm of youngsters puzzled on the day of\npublication with no little bewilderment and fury.  They had refused to\nallow any of their number to act as policeman, and had secretly been\nmaking merry over the embarrassment of their late persecutors, and\nwondering whatever they would be able to say for their humiliated selves\nin the _Dominican_--and lo! here was an article which, if it meant\nanything, meant that the heroic rebellion of the juniors was regarded\nnot with dismay, but with positive triumph, by the very fellows it had\nbeen intended to \"squash!\"\n\n\"What does it mean, Padger?\" asked Bramble, who, never much of a\nscholar, was quite unable to master the meaning of this.\n\n\"It's all a pack of crams,\" replied Padger, not quite sure of the sense\nhimself.\n\n\"It means,\" said Stephen, \"the fellows say they are jolly glad to get\nrid of us.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" yelled Bramble; \"oh, I say, you fellows, come to the meeting!\nJolly glad!  They aren't a bit glad.\"\n\n\"They say so,\" said Paul.  \"Hold hard, Bramble, let's read the rest.\"\n\nIt was all his friends could do to restrain the ardent Bramble from\nsummoning a meeting on the spot to denounce the _Dominican_ and all its\n\"crams.\"  But they managed to hold him steady while they read on.\n\n\"The Doctor never did a more--pat--pat--ri--what do you call it?--\npatriotic deed than this!\"\n\n\"Hullo, I say, look here!\" cried Stephen, turning quite yellow; \"the\nDoctor's in it, they say, Bramble.  `The small animals'--that's you and\nPadger--`are to be kept in their own quarters.'  Whew! there's a go.\"\n\n\"What!\" shrieked Bramble, \"who says so?  The Doctor never said so.  I\nshall do what I choose.  He never said so.  Bother the Doctor!  Who's\ncoming to the meeting, eh?\"\n\nBut at that moment the grave form of Doctor Senior appeared in the midst\nof the group, just in time to hear Master Bramble's last complimentary\nshout.\n\nThe head master was in the most favourable times an object of terror to\nthe \"guilty-conscienced youth\" of the Fourth Junior, and the sight even\nof his back often sufficed to quell their tumults.  But here he stood\nface to face with his unhappy victims, one of whom had just cried,\n\"Bother the Doctor!\" and all of whom had by word and gesture approved of\nthe sentiment.  Why would not the pavement yawn and swallow them?  And\nwhich of them would not at that moment have given a thousand pounds (if\nhe had it) to be standing anywhere but where he was?\n\n\"Go to your class-room,\" said the Doctor, sternly, eyeing the culprits\none by one, \"and wait there for me.\"\n\nThey slunk off meekly in obedience to this order, and waited the hour of\nvengeance in blank dismay.\n\nDr Senior did not keep them long in suspense, however.  His slow, firm\nstep sounded presently down the corridor, and at the sound each wretched\nculprit quaked with horror.\n\nMr Rastle was in the room, and rose as usual to greet his chief; the\nboys also, as by custom bound, rose in their places.  \"Good morning, Mr\nRastle,\" said the Doctor.  \"Are your boys all here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we have just called over.\"\n\n\"Ah!  And what class comes on first?\"\n\n\"English literature, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Rastle, I will take the class this morning, please--instead\nof you.\"\n\nA groan of horror passed through the ranks of the unhappy Guinea-pigs\nand Tadpoles at these words.  Bramble looked wildly about him, if haply\nhe might escape by a window or lie hid in a desk; while Stephen, Paul,\nPadger, and the other ringleaders, gave themselves up for lost, and\nmentally bade farewell to joy for ever.\n\n\"What have the boys been reading?\" inquired Dr Senior of Mr Rastle.\n\n\"Grey's _Elegy_, sir.  We have just got through it.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Grey's _Elegy_!\" said the Doctor; and then, as if forgetting where\nhe was, he began repeating to himself,--\n\n  \"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\n  The lowing herds wind slowly o'er the lea.\"\n\n\"The first boy,--what can you tell me about the curfew?\"  The first boy\nwas well up in the curfew, and rattled off a \"full, true, and particular\naccount\" of that fine old English institution, much to everybody's\nsatisfaction.  The Doctor went on repeating two or three verses till he\ncame to the line,--\n\n  \"The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\"\n\n\"What does that line mean?\" he asked of a boy on the second desk.\n\nThe boy scarcely knew what it meant, but the boy below him did, and was\nquite eager for the question to be passed on.  It was passed on, and the\ngenius answered promptly, \"Four old men.\"\n\n\"Four rude old men,\" shouted the next, seeing a chance.\n\n\"Four rude old men who used to sleep in church,\" cried another, ready to\ncap all the rest.\n\nThe Doctor passed the question on no further; but gravely explained the\nmeaning of the line, and then proceeded with his repetition in rather a\nsadder voice.\n\nNow and again he stopped short and demanded an explanation of some\nobscure phrase, the answers to which were now correct, now hazy, now\nbrilliantly original.  On the whole it was not satisfactory; and when\nfor a change the Doctor gave up reciting, and made the boys read, the\neffect was still worse.  One boy, quite a master of elocution, spoilt\nthe whole beauty of the lines,--\n\n  \"Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\n  The short and simple annals of the Poor,--\"\n\nby reading \"animals\" instead of \"annals\"; while another, of an equally\nzoological turn of mind, announced that--\n\n  \"On some fond _beast_ the parting soul relies,--\"\n\ninstead of \"breast.\"\n\nBut the climax of this \"animal mania\" was reached when the wretched\nBramble, finally pitched upon to go on, in spite of all his efforts to\nhide, rendered the passage:--\n\n  \"Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,\n  Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn,\" etcetera, as--\n\n\"Happy some hairy-headed swine may say.\"\n\nThis was a little too much.\n\n\"That will do, sir,\" said the Doctor, sternly.  \"That will do.  What is\nyour name, sir?\"\n\n\"Bramble, please, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, Bramble, how long have you been in this class?\"\n\n\"Two years, sir.\"\n\n\"And have you been all the while on the bottom desk?\"\n\n\"Yes, please, sir.\"\n\n\"Sir, it displeases me.  You are a dunce, sir.\"\n\nAnd then, to Bramble's utter despair and to the terror of all the other\nunprofitable members of the class, the Doctor proceeded to catechise\nsharply the unhappy youth on his general knowledge of the subjects\ntaught during the term.\n\nAs might be expected, the exhibition was a miserable one; Bramble was\nfound wanting in every particular.  The simplest questions could hardly\ncoax a correct answer out of him, whereas an ordinary inquiry was\nhopelessly beyond his powers.  He mixed up William the Conqueror and\nWilliam of Orange; he subtracted what ought to be multiplied, and\nfloundered about between conjunctions and prepositions in a sickening\nway.  The Doctor did not spare him.  He went ruthlessly on--exposing the\nboy's ignorance, first in one thing, then another.  Bramble stood and\ntrembled and perspired before him, and wished he was dead, but the\nquestions still came on.  If he had answered a single thing correctly it\nwould have been a different matter, but he knew nothing.  I believe he\ndid know what twice two was, but that was the one question the Doctor\ndid not ask him.  As to French, Latin, Grammar, and Euclid, the clock on\nthe wall knew as much of them as Bramble.  It came to an end at last.\n\n\"Come here, Bramble,\" said the Doctor, gravely; \"and come here, you, and\nyou, and you,\" added he, pointing to Stephen and Paul and four or five\nothers of the party who had been reading the _Dominican_ that morning.\n\nThe luckless youngsters obeyed, and when they stood in a row before the\ndreaded Doctor, the bottom form and half of the bottom form but one were\nempty.\n\n\"Now, you boys,\" began the head master, very gravely, \"I hadn't intended\nto examine you to-day; but, from something I heard one of you say, I\nfelt rather anxious to know how some of you are doing in your studies.\nThese half-dozen boys I was particularly anxious to know of, because I\nheard them talking to-day as if they were the most important boys in the\nwhole school.  They _are_ the most important; for they are the most\nignorant, and require, and in future will receive, the closest looking\nafter.  You, little boys,\" said the Doctor, turning to the row of\nabashed culprits, \"take a word of warning from me.  Do not be silly as\nwell as dunces.  Do not think, as long as you know least of any one in\nthe school you can pretend to rule the school.  I hope some of you have\nbeen led to see to-day you are not as clever as you would like to be.\nIf you try, and work hard, and stick like men to your lessons, you will\nknow more than you do now; and when you do know more you will see that\nthe best way for little boys to get on is not by giving themselves\nridiculous airs, but by doing their duty steadily in class, and living\nat peace with one another, and submitting quietly to the discipline of\nthe school.  Don't let me hear any more of this recent nonsense.  You'll\nbe going off in a day or two for the holidays.  Take my advice, and\nthink over what I have said; and next term let me see you in your right\nminds, determined to work hard and do your part honestly for the credit\nof the good old school.  Go to your places, boys.\"\n\nAnd so the Doctor's visitation came to an end.  It made a very deep\nimpression on the youthful members of the Fourth Junior.  Most of them\nfelt very much ashamed of themselves; and nearly every one felt his\nveneration and admiration for the Doctor greatly heightened.  Only a few\nincorrigibles like Bramble professed to make light of the scene through\nwhich they had just passed, and even he, it was evident, was\nconsiderably chastened by his experience.\n\nThat evening, after the first bed-bell, Dr Senior requested some of the\nmasters to meet with him for a few minutes in his study.\n\n\"Do any of you know,\" asked the head master, \"anything about this\nnewspaper, the _Dominican_, which I see hanging outside the Fifth door?\"\n\n\"I hear a great many boys talking about it,\" said Mr Jellicott of the\nFifth.  \"It is the joint production of several of the boys in my form.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  A Fifth form paper!\" said the Doctor.  \"Has any one perused\nit?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Mr Rastle.  \"It seems to me to be cleverly managed,\nthough perhaps a little personal.\"\n\n\"Ah, only natural with schoolboys,\" said the Doctor.  \"I should like to\nsee it.  Can you fetch it, Rastle?\"\n\n\"It is nailed to the wall,\" said Mr Rastle, smiling, \"like Luther's\nmanifesto; but I can get one of the boys, I dare say, to unfasten it for\nyou.\"\n\n\"No, do not do that,\" said the Doctor.  \"If the mountain will not come\nto Mahomet, you know, Mahomet and his disciples must go to the mountain,\neh, Mr Harrison?  I think we might venture out and peruse it where it\nhangs.\"  So half-stealthily, when the whole school was falling asleep,\nDr Senior and his colleagues stepped out into the passage, and by the\naid of a candle satisfied their curiosity as to the mysterious\n_Dominican_.\n\nA good deal of its humour was, of course, lost upon them, as they could\nhardly be expected to understand the force of all the allusions it\ncontained.  But they saw quite enough to enable them to gather the\ngeneral tenor of the paper; it amused and it concerned them.\n\n\"It shows considerable ability on the part of its editor,\" said the\nDoctor, after the masters had returned to his study, \"but I rather fear\nits tone may give offence to some of the boys--in the Sixth for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"I fancy there is a considerable amount of rivalry between the two head\nforms,\" said Mr Harrison.\n\n\"If there is,\" said Mr Jellicott, \"this newspaper is hardly likely to\ndiminish it.\"\n\n\"And it seems equally severe on the juniors,\" said Mr Rastle.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Doctor, smiling, \"about that `strike.'  I can't\nunderstand that.  Really the politics of your little world, Rastle, are\ntoo intricate for any ordinary mortal.  But I gather the small boys have\na grievance against the big ones?\"\n\n\"Yes, on the question of fagging, I believe.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the Doctor.  \"I hope that is not coming up.  You know I'm\nheretic enough to believe that a certain amount of fagging does not do\nharm in a school like ours.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mr Jellicott.  \"But these small boys are really\nvery amusing.  They appear to be regularly organised, and some of them\nhave quite a martyr spirit about them.\"\n\n\"As I can testify,\" said Mr Rastle, proceeding to recount the case of\nStephen Greenfield and his sore cheek.  The Doctor listened to it all,\nhalf gravely, half amused, and presently said:\n\n\"Well, it is as well the holidays are coming.  Things are sure to calm\ndown in them; and next term I dare say we shall be all the wiser for the\nlessons of this.  Meanwhile I should like to see the editor of this\npaper to-morrow.  Who is he, Jellicott?\"\n\n\"I believe it is Pembury.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Send him to me, will you, to-morrow at ten?  Good-night.\nThank you for your advice!\"\n\nNext morning the Doctor talked to Pembury about the _Dominican_.  He\npraised the paper generally, and congratulated him on the success of his\nefforts.  But he took exception to its personal tone.\n\n\"As long as you can keep on the broad round of humour and pure fun,\nnothing can please us more than to see you improving your time in a\nmanner like this.  But you must be very careful to avoid what will give\npain or offence to any section of your schoolfellows.  I was sorry to\nsee in the present number a good deal that might have been well omitted\nof that kind.  Remember this, Pembury, I want all you boys, instead of\nseparating off one set from another, and making divisions between class\nand class, to try to make common cause over the whole school, and unite\nall the boys in common cause for the good of Saint Dominic's.  Now your\npaper could help not a little in this direction.  Indeed, if it does not\nhelp, it had better not be issued.  There!  I shall not refer to the\nmatter again unless you give me cause.  I do not want to discourage you\nin your undertaking, for it's really an excellent idea, and capitally\ncarried out.  And _verbum sap_, you know, is quite sufficient.\"\n\nAnthony, with rather a long face, retired from the Doctor's presence.\n\nA few days later the school broke up for the summer holidays.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18. A HOLIDAY ADVENTURE.\n\nWhen a big school like Saint Dominic's is gathered together within the\ncomparatively narrow compass of four walls, there _is_ some possibility\nof ascertaining how it prospers, and what events are interesting it.\nBut when the same school is scattered to the four winds of heaven during\nthe holidays, it would require a hundred eyes and more to follow its\nmovements.\n\nIt would be impossible, for instance, at one and the same time to\naccompany Raleigh and his sisters up Snowdon, and look on at Bramble\ncatching crabs on the rocks at Broadstairs; nor, while we follow Dr\nSenior among the peaks and passes of Switzerland (and remark, by the\nway, what a nice quiet boy Tom Senior is, when he has only his father\nand his mother to tempt him into mischief) can we possibly expect to\nregard very attentively the doings of Simon, as he gapes about before\nthe London shop-windows, and jerks off a score or more stanzas of his\n\"Hart's Earnings,\" which is now about a quarter done.\n\nSo the reader must imagine how most of the boys spent their holidays,\nhow they enjoyed them, and how they behaved themselves during the\nperiod, and be content to be told only about two groups of\nholiday-makers, about whom, as they are destined to figure pretty\nconspicuously in next term's doings at Saint Dominic's, it will be\ninteresting to hear rather more particularly now.\n\nAnd the first group--if we can call a single person a \"group\"--is Loman.\n\nLoman began his holidays in anything but cheerful spirits.  No one had\nseemed particularly sorry to say good-bye to him at Saint Dominic's, and\na good many had been unmistakably glad.  And he had quite enough on his\nmind, apart from this, to make his home-coming far less joyous than it\nmight have been.  It ought to have been the happiest event possible, for\nhe was coming home to parents who loved him, friends who were glad to\nsee him, and a home where every comfort and pleasure was within his\nreach.  Few boys, indeed, were more blessed than Loman with all the\nadvantages of a Christian and happy home; and few boys could have failed\nto return to such a home after a long absence without delight.  But to\nLoman, these holidays, the surroundings of home afforded very little\npleasure.  His mind was ill at ease.  The burden of debt was upon him,\nand the burden of suspense.  He had tried hard to assure himself that\nall would come right--that he would certainly win the scholarship, and\nso wipe off the debt; but his confidence became less and less\ncomfortable as time went on.\n\nHe dared not tell his troubles to his father, for he feared his\nupbraiding; and he would not confess them to his mother, for she, he\nknew, would tell all to his father.  He still clung to the hope that all\nwould come right in the end; and then what would have been gained by\ntelling his parents all about it?\n\nThe one thing was hard work--and Loman came home determined to work.\nHis parents saw him out of spirits, and were concerned.  They did what\nthey could to cheer him, but without much success.\n\n\"Come, Edward, put away your books to-day,\" his mother would say; \"I\nwant you to drive me over to Falkham in the pony-chaise.\"\n\n\"I really can't, mother; I must work for the scholarship.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, boy; what is a scholarship compared with your health?\nBesides, you'll work all the better if you take some exercise.\"\n\nBut for a week nothing could tempt him out.  Then, instead of\naccompanying his father or mother, he would take long solitary rides on\nhis own pony, brooding all the while over his troubles.\n\nOne day, when in the course of one of these expeditions he had taken the\ndirection of Maltby--which was only fifteen miles distant from his\nhome--he became suddenly aware of an approaching dog-cart in the road\nbefore him, and a familiar voice crying, \"Why, if it ain't young Squire\nLoman, riding a bit of very tidy horseflesh too, as I'm a Dutchman!\"\n\nIt was Cripps.  What evil spirit could have brought him on the scene\nnow?\n\n\"Well, I never reckoned to see you now,\" said he, in his usual jaunty\nmanner.  \"Fact is, I was just trotting over to see _you_.  I wanted to\ntry what this here cob was made of, and, thinks I, I may as well kill\ntwo birds with one stone, and look up my young squire while I'm about\nit.\"\n\n\"Coming to see me!\" exclaimed Loman, horrified.  \"I say, Cripps, you\nmustn't do that.  My father would be very angry, you know.\"\n\n\"Nice, that is!  As if I wasn't as good company as any one else!\"\n\n\"Oh! it's not that,\" said Loman, fearing he had given offence.  \"What I\nmean is--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know--about that there rod.  Bless me!  I won't let out on you,\nmy beauty--leastways, if you come up to scratch.  He'd like to hear the\nstory, though, the old gentleman, I fancy.  Wouldn't he now?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have him know it for worlds.  It'll be all right, Cripps,\nindeed it will about the money.\"\n\nMr Cripps looked very benignant.\n\n\"All right, young swell, I hope it will.  Funny I feel such an interest\nin you, 'specially since that young greeny friend of yours put in a word\nfor you.  He's a real nice sort, he is--he owes you one, and no\nmistake.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Loman, in surprise; \"who do you mean?  Young Greenfield?\"\n\n\"To be sure.  Regular young chum of mine, he is.  I know all about you,\nmy master, and no mistake!\"\n\n\"What--the young sneak?  What has he been saying about me?\"\n\n\"Eh!--what ain't he been saying!  In course you didn't half murder him,\neh?  In course you ain't a good hand at cheatin' all round up at the\nschool!  What?  In course you ain't saying nice things agin me all over\nthe place--and in course some of us wouldn't like to see you get a\nreg'lar good hiding, wouldn't we?  Bless you, I knows all about it; but\nI'm mum, never fear!\"  Loman was furious.\n\n\"The young liar!\" he exclaimed.  \"I did owe him one; I'll pay him when\nwe get back!\"\n\n\"Hold hard, young gentleman,\" said Cripps, coolly.  \"To be sure, he\nain't downright sweet on you; but I ain't a-going to have him smashed,\nmind, all to bits.  Well, never mind that.  I'll turn back with you,\nyoung gentleman, if I may.  We're only three miles from Maltby, and\nmaybe you'll honour a poor chap like me by having a look in at the\nCockchafer.\"\n\nLoman did not know how to say \"No,\" much as he disliked and feared his\nhost.  He returned with him to Maltby, and there spent an hour in the\nCockchafer.  He was introduced to several of Mr Cripps's low friends,\nin whose society he found it easy enough to become low himself.  Cripps,\nby a judicious mixture of flattery and sly threats, managed to keep the\nboy well in hand, and when at last he rose to go it was with a promise\nto return again before the holidays were over--\"to prevent Cripps having\nthe trouble of calling on him,\" as that virtuous gentleman significantly\nput it.\n\nLoman kept his promise, and visited Maltby once or twice, becoming each\ntime more familiar with Cripps and his low friends, who made a great\ndeal of him, and flattered him on all possible occasions, so that the\nboy presently found himself, as he imagined, quite a young hero at the\nCockchafer.\n\nMeanwhile, naturally, his reading fell behindhand.  His parents, only\ntoo glad to see their boy taking more regular exercise, never suspected\nor inquired as to the direction of his frequent solitary rides.  To them\nhe seemed the same quiet, clever boy they fondly believed him.  Little\nguessed they of the troubles that filled his breast or the toils that\nwere daily enwrapping him!\n\nThus Loman's holidays came to an end.  The farewell was once more said,\nparents and son parted, and on the first day of an eventful term the boy\nfound himself once more within the walls of Saint Dominic's.\n\nOliver and Stephen, meanwhile, had been spending a very different sort\nof holiday at home.  There was high feast and revelry when the two boys\nreturned once more to the maternal roof.  Stephen for once in a way had\nthe satisfaction of finding himself a most unmistakable hero.  He never\ntired telling of his adventures and discoursing on the whole manner of\nhis life since the day he left home for Saint Dominic's.  To his sister\nhe recounted in all the slang phraseology he had at his command, the\nfamous cricket matches in which he had borne a part; and she, though it\nwas exactly like Greek to her, drank in every word with interest.  And\nto his mother he narrated his various fights with Bramble, and the\nterrific adventures through which he had passed, till the good lady's\nhair nearly stood on end, and she began to think a public school was a\nterrible place to send a small boy to.\n\nOliver, of course, had his stories to tell too, only in a more sober\nmanner.\n\nThere was a great scene when, on the first day of the holidays, the\nelder brother produced his books and announced that he must study at\nleast two hours a day in prospect of the Nightingale Scholarship\nexamination.  But every one knew how much depended on his winning that\nscholarship, and in a few years being able to go to the university, so\nthat the family gave in in the end, and Oliver was allowed his two\nhours' study, but not a second more, every day.  Stephen, meanwhile,\ntaught his sister round-arm bowling, and devoted himself mind and body\nto the bicycle.\n\nThe two brothers, during these holidays, became very great cronies.  At\nschool Oliver had seen comparatively little of his young brother, but\nnow they were daily and hourly thrown together, the brotherly instincts\nin each blossomed wonderfully, and a mutual attachment sprang up which\nhad hardly been there before.\n\nIt had been arranged, before breaking-up, that Oliver and Wraysford\nshould spend the last week of the holiday together in rowing down the\nThames from Oxford to London.\n\nGreat was Stephen's joy and pride when one morning, near the appointed\ntime, Oliver said to him, \"Look here, Stee.  How would you like to come\nwith Wray and me next week?\"\n\n\"Like! wouldn't I rather!\" shouted the small boy in ecstasy.  \"Thanks,\nNoll, old man!  I say, it will be a spree.\"  And the youngster became so\nriotous over the prospect that his elder brother had to threaten not to\ntake him at all, and give him a thrashing into the bargain, before he\ncould be reduced to order.\n\nThey were to take a tent with them, and cooking utensils, so as to be\nquite independent of inns, and each voyager was to contribute his share\nof provender.  Quite a Robinson Crusoe business, even down to the desert\nisland, for on desert islands the boys had declared they intended every\nnight to take up their quarters, and, come hail, snow, or lightning,\nthere to sleep under their waterproof tent.\n\nMrs Greenfield didn't half like the idea, and became very pathetic on\nthe subject of ague and rheumatic fever.  But the boys carried the day\nby promising faithfully that they would catch neither malady.  The\nlooked-for day came at last, and to Oxford they went, where the familiar\nsight of Wraysford, in boating costume, at the railway station still\nfurther elated their high spirits.  The boat was ready.  The tent, the\nprovender, the blankets, were snugly stowed away on board.  The weather\nwas fine, the river was charming, everything promised well; and\npunctually that Monday afternoon the three adventurers loosed from their\nmoorings and turned the nose of their boat towards London.\n\nI wish I could tell the reader all the events of that wonderful voyage:\nhow they paddled down merrily with the stream; how they found their\ndesert island covered with nettles, which they had to mow down with\ntheir oars; how the soup-kettle wouldn't act, and the stew-pan leaked;\nhow grand the potted lobster tasted; how Stephen offered to make tea\nwith muddy water, and how the paraffin oil of their lanterns leaked all\nover their plum-cake and sandwiches; how Stephen was sent up inland to\nforage, and came back with wonderful purchases of eggs and milk; how\nthey started off one day leaving their tent behind them, and had to row\nback in a panic to recover it; how it rained one night, and a puddle\nformed on the roof of the tent, which presently grew so big that it\noverflowed and gave Wraysford a shower-bath; how each morning they all\ntook headers into the stream, much to the alarm of the sleepy ducks; how\nthey now and then ran foul of a boat, and now and then were turned off\ntheir camping ground by an indignant keeper!  It was glorious fun.  But\nit would take a volume to recount all that happened to them.\n\nThey were coming near the end of their cruise.  They had paddled down\npast the magnificent woods of Cliveden, and under the pretty bridge of\nMaidenhead; they had watched the boys bathing at \"Athens,\" and they had\nrowed through the gloomy shadow of Windsor Castle and on past Eton.\n\nHere the river is broken by a string of islands, which in many parts\nmake the stream narrow; and the river being full of boats and barges,\nour three adventurers found themselves called upon to exercise more than\nordinary precautions in keeping their course.  This responsibility\nbecame at last so irksome that Oliver said, \"I say, can't we get out of\nthis rabble anyhow?  Why shouldn't we take the other side of the\nislands?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  It would be a good deal quieter.  I wonder none of the\nboats do it.\"\n\n\"Let's try, anyhow.  We can't be far from the lock, and then the river\nwill be wider.  Take us up inside the next island, Stee, and mind you\ndon't foul any one while you're about it.\"\n\nStephen did as he was bid.  The stream was pretty strong just there, and\nthe two rowers had to pull pretty hard to get round without drifting on\nto the island.\n\nOnce out of the main stream, they were delighted to find the course\nclear.  Indeed, they had the channel all to themselves.\n\n\"What a jolly pace the stream is going at!\" said Stephen; \"why don't you\ndrift, you fellows, instead of pulling like that?\"\n\n\"Good idea for you, young 'un,\" said Wraysford, pulling in his oar.\nOliver followed his example.\n\n\"Keep a look-out ahead,\" said he to Stephen, \"and sing out if any\nthing's coming.\"\n\nStephen said, \"All right,\" but (careless pilot that he was) began\npulling on his socks and shoes, which he had dispensed with during the\nmorning.\n\nThus occupied, and the other two sitting with their backs to the prow,\nthe unnatural pace at which the boat flew along did not for a moment or\ntwo become apparent.  Suddenly, however, Wraysford started up.\n\n\"Get out your oar, Noll--quick!\"\n\n\"What's the row?\" said Oliver, proceeding leisurely to obey the order.\n\n\"The weir!  Quick, man, quick, or we shall be on to it!\"\n\nThey had indeed got into the race leading to the weir, and every moment\nthe stream, swelled by recent rains, rushed faster.\n\n\"Pull your right--hard!\" cried Wraysford, backing water while Oliver\nflew to his oar.\n\nThere was just time, by a tremendous effort, to save themselves; but\nOliver's oar was caught under one of the seats, and before he could\nextricate it the precious opportunity was lost.\n\nNo one said a word.  Stephen, with pale face, pulled his rudder string;\nand Wraysford, with his one oar, tried desperately to arrest the\nheadlong progress of the boat.\n\nThere was a shout from the bank, and a nearer and louder one from the\nlock.  They became conscious of a great half-open gate on their right,\nand a rush of footsteps beside them.  Then, in far shorter time than it\ntakes to write it, the boat, side on to the weir, lurched and dashed for\na moment in the troubled water, and the next instant turned over, and\nthe three boys were struggling in the water.\n\nIn an ordinary current such an adventure would have been of little\nmoment, for the boys could swim.  But in a torrent like this it was an\nawful peril.  The swift flood sweeps on and sucks under its prey with\nfearful force.  To resist it is impossible--to escape being dashed\nagainst its stony bottom is almost as impossible.\n\nMercifully for Oliver, he did escape this latter peril, and, being cool\nalways in the presence of danger, he offered no resistance to the\nstream, but struck out hard under the water for as long as his breath\nwould permit.\n\nWhen at last, exhausted and unable to swim farther, he rose to the\nsurface, he was in calm deep water many yards below the weir.  Help was\nat hand, or he could never have reached the bank.  As it was, when at\nlast friendly arms did drag him ashore, he was too exhausted even to\nutter his brother's name.\n\nWhere was Stephen? and where was Wraysford?\n\nWraysford had been more fortunate even than Oliver in his first capsize.\nHe was swept over the weir, indeed, but into a side eddy which brought\nhim up violently against a projecting branch, to which he clung wildly.\nHere he would have been safe, and even able to help himself to shore.\nBut at the moment when he began to draw himself up from the water on to\nthe branch, there was something--an arm cast wildly up--in the water\nbeside him.  In an instant Wraysford quitted his hold and plunged once\nmore into the rapid.  How, he knew not, but he just reached the hapless\nboy.  It was too late to recover the friendly branch.  All he could do\nwas to cling to Stephen and trust to reaching calm water safely.  Many a\nbruise the two received in that terrible passage, but the elder boy\nnever once quitted his hold of the younger.\n\nAt last--it seemed an age--calm water was reached, providentially near\nthe bank.  Still clinging to one another, they were pulled ashore,\nbruised, stunned, but safe.\n\nThus ended this famous holiday cruise.  The three boys kept their own\nsecret, and talked little about the adventure, even to one another.\n\nIn due time the holidays ended, and the Dominicans reassembled once more\nin their venerable Alma Mater.  Need I say there were three within those\nwalls who, whatever they were before, were now friends bound together by\na bond the closest of all--a bond which had stood the test of life and\ndeath?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19. AN OLD FIRE RE-KINDLED.\n\nSaint Dominic's reassembled after the holidays in an amiable frame of\nmind.\n\nThe Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, as the Doctor had prophesied, had cooled\ndown considerably in spirit during the period, and now returned quietly\nto work just as if the mighty \"strike\" had never existed.  Stephen's\nregular fights with Bramble recommenced the very first day, so that\neverything was quite like old times.\n\nOliver found that the Fifth, all but one or two, had quite forgotten\ntheir suspicions of his bravery which had spoiled the pleasure of his\nlast term, and there seemed every prospect of his getting through this\nwith less risk to his quick temper than before.\n\nAs for the Sixth, the Fifth had forgiven them all their offences, and\nwould have been quite prepared, had it been allowed, to live in peace\nwith their seniors, and forget all the dissensions of the Summer term.\nBut it was not allowed, and an event which happened early in the term\nserved to revive all the old animosities between the two head classes.\n\nAt Saint Dominic's, for reasons best known to the all-wise beings who\npresided over its management, the principal examinations and \"removes\"\nof the year took place not, as in most schools, at the end of the\nMidsummer term, but at the beginning of the Autumn term, about\nMichaelmas; consequently now, with the examinations looming in the\ndistance, everybody who had anything to hope for from hard work settled\ndown to study like mad.  Cricket was over for the year, and football had\nnot begun.  Except boating there was not much doing out of doors, and\nfor that reason the season was favourable for work.  Studies, which used\nto be bear-gardens now suddenly assumed an appearance of respectability\nand quiet.  Books took the place of boxing-gloves, and pens of\nfencing-sticks.  The disorderly idlers who had been in the habit of\ninvading at will the quarters of the industrious were now given to\nunderstand they must \"kick-up their heels\" elsewhere.  _They_ might not\nwant to grind, but others did.\n\nThe idlers of the Fifth, to whom this warning was addressed on every\nhand, had nothing for it but to obey, and, feeling themselves greatly\nill-used, to retire sadly, to some spot where \"they could kick-up a row\nto themselves.\"\n\nCasting about them for such a spot, it happened that Braddy and Ricketts\none day lit almost by accident on an old empty study, which some years\nsince had been a monitor's room, but was now empty and tenantless.\n\nIt at once occurred to these two astute heroes that this would be a\nmagnificent place for boxing-matches.  In the other studies one was\nalways banging against the corners of tables, or tripping over fenders,\nbut here there was absolutely nothing, but four bare walls to interfere\nwith anybody.\n\nThey called in two more friends--Tom Senior and another--who declared it\nwas a splendid find, and the four thereupon took formal possession of\ntheir new territory, and inaugurated the event by a terrific\neight-handed match.\n\nNothing could have been more satisfactory.  The room was well out of the\nway; the studious ones of the Fifth were spared all annoyance, and the\nriotous ones had an asylum to go to.  No one was a bit the worse for the\nmove; every one, on the contrary, found himself decidedly the better.\n\n\"Go and kick-up a row in the monitor's room,\" became quite a common\nobjurgation in the Form, among the diligent; as common, in fact, as\n\"Come along, old man, and have it out in the monitor's room,\" was among\nthe idlers.\n\nBut, as ill-luck would have it, this delightful retreat happened to be\nsituated immediately over the study occupied by Wren of the Sixth.  That\nworthy hero, seated one afternoon over his books, was startled by a\nterrific noise, followed by a vibration, followed by the rattling of all\nhis tumblers in the cupboard, followed by a dull, heavy thud over his\nhead, which tempted him to believe either that an earthquake was in\nprogress, or that one of the chimney-stacks had fallen on to the roof.\nWhen, however, the noise was repeated, and with it were blended laughter\nand shouts of \"Now then, let him have it!\"\n\n\"Well parried!\"\n\n\"Bravo, Bully!\" and the like, Wren began to change his mind, and laid\ndown his pen.  He walked up the stairs to the upper landing, where, at\nonce, the noise guided him to the old monitor's room.  Then the truth\ndawned upon him.  He stayed long enough to get a pretty clear idea of\nwho the \"new lodgers\" were, and then prudently retired without\nattempting a parley single-handed.\n\nBut next morning, when the festive rioters of the Fifth approached once\nmore the scene of their revels, what was their amazement and rage to\nfind the door locked, and the following notice, on a piece of school\npaper, affixed to the panel--\"Monitor's room.  This room is closed by\ndirection of the monitors.\"\n\nYou might have knocked them over with a feather, so stupefied were they\nby this announcement!  They stared at the door, they stared at one\nanother, and then they broke out into a tempest of rage.\n\n\"The blackguards! what do they mean?\" exclaimed Braddy, tearing down the\npaper and crushing it up in his hands.\n\n\"Monitor's room, indeed!\" cried Ricketts.  \"_We'll_ let them see whose\nroom it is!\"\n\n\"Kick open the door, can't you?\" said Tom Senior.\n\nThey did kick open the door between them.  The lock was a weak one, and\nsoon gave way.\n\nOnce inside, the evicted ones indulged their triumph by an uproar of\nmore than usual vehemence, longing that it might tempt into their\nclutches the daring intruders who had presumed to interfere with their\npossession.  No one came.  They had their fling undisturbed.  But before\nthey quitted their stronghold one of their number, by diligent\nsearching, had found in the lock of a neighbouring study-door a key\nwhich would fit theirs.  Repairing, therefore, the catch, damaged by\ntheir late forcible entry, they calmly locked the door behind them when\nthey went, and affixed to it, in the identical place where the other\nnotice had hung, \"Fifth Form.  Private study.  Not to be entered without\npermission.\"\n\nOf course, the news of this interesting adventure soon spread, and for a\nday or two the diligent as well as the idle on either side looked on\nwith increasing interest for the issue of the contest.\n\nFor a while the Fifth had the best of it.  They defied the enemy to turn\nthem out, and procured and fixed an additional lock on the door.  The\nSixth threatened to report the matter to the Doctor, and summoned the\ninvaders for the last time to capitulate.  The invaders laughed them to\nscorn, and protested the room belonged to them, and leave it they would\nnot for all the monitors in the world.  The monitors retired, and the\nFifth enjoyed their triumph.\n\nBut next day the Doctor abruptly entered the Fifth Form room, and said,\n\"There is an unoccupied room at the end of the top landing, which some\nboys in this class have been making use of to the annoyance of other\nboys.  This room, please remember, is not to be entered in future\nwithout my permission.\"\n\nCheckmate with a vengeance for the Fifth!\n\nThis event it was which, trivial in itself, re-kindled once more with\nredoubled heat the old animosity between the two head Forms at Saint\nDominic's.  Although the original quarrel had been confined to only\nhalf-a-dozen individuals, it became now a party question of intense\ninterest.  The Sixth, who were the triumphant party, could afford to\ntreat the matter lightly and smile over it, a demeanour which irritated\nthe already enraged Fifth past description.  The two Forms cut one\nanother dead in the passages.  The Fifth would gladly have provoked\ntheir rivals to blows, but, like sensible men, the Sixth kept the right\nside of the law, and refused to have anything to do with the challenges\ndaily hurled at them.\n\nAs might be expected, the affair did not long remain a secret from the\nrest of the school.  The Fourth Senior, as a body, stood up for the\nSixth, and the Third and Second, on the whole, sided with the Fifth.\nBut when it came to the junior school--the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles--all\nother partisanship was thrown quite into the shade.\n\nThe quarrel was one completely after their own hearts.  It had begun in\na row, it had gone on in a row, and, if it ever ended, it would end in a\nrow.\n\nA meeting was summoned at the earliest opportunity to take the momentous\nmatter into consideration.\n\n\"What I say,\" said Bramble, \"is, it's a jolly good job!\"\n\n\"What's a jolly good job?\" demanded Stephen, who, of course, was red-hot\nfor the Fifth.\n\n\"Why, chucking them out!  I'm glad to see it, ain't you, Padger?\"\n\n\"They didn't chuck them out!\" roared Paul; \"they went and sneaked to the\nDoctor, that's what they did!\"\n\n\"I don't care!  I say it's a jolly good job!  Those who say it's a jolly\ngood job hold up--\"\n\n\"Shut up your row!\" cried Stephen; \"you're always sticking yourself up.\nI say it's a beastly shame, and I hope the Fifth will let them know it!\"\n\n\"You're a young idiot, that's what you are!\" exclaimed Bramble in a\nrage.  \"What business have you got at the meeting?  Turn him out!\"\n\n\"I'll turn _you_ out!\" replied the undaunted Stephen; \"I've as much\nright here as you have.  So there!\"\n\n\"Turn him out, can't you?\" roared Bramble.  \"Bah! who goes and swills\nginger-beer down in a public-house in the town, eh?\"\n\nThis most unexpected turn to the conversation startled Stephen.  He\nturned quite pale as he replied, \"_I_ did, there!  But I didn't go in at\nthe public door.  And you've been sneaking!\"\n\n\"No, I haven't.  Padger told me, didn't you, Padger?  Padger peeped\nthrough the door, and saw you.  Oh, my eye! won't I kick-up a shine\nabout it!  I'll let out on you, see if I don't.  Bah, public-house boy!\npotboy, yah!\"\n\nStephen's only answer to this was a book, accurately shied at the head\nof his enemy.\n\nThe subsequent proceedings at the meeting were a trifle animated, but\notherwise not interesting to the reader.  The chief result was that the\nGuinea-pigs emerged as uncompromising champions for the Fifth, and the\nTadpoles equally strong for the Sixth, while Stephen felt decidedly\nuncomfortable as to the consequences of Bramble's discovery of his\nsecret visits last term to the Cockchafer.\n\nStephen had in a confidential moment during the holidays told Oliver of\nthese visits, and of his intimacy with Mr Cripps.  The elder brother\nwas very angry and astonished when he heard of it.  He set before the\nboy, in no measured terms, the risk he was running by breaking one of\nthe rules of the school; and, more than that, he said Cripps was a\nblackguard, and demanded of Stephen a promise, there and then, that he\nwould never again enter the Cockchafer under any pretext whatever.\nStephen, forced to submit, although not convinced that Cripps was such a\nwicked man as his brother made out, promised, but reserved to himself\nmentally the right to see Cripps at least once more at the Lock-House,\nthere to return him the bicycle lantern, which it will be remembered\nthat kind gentleman had lent the boy before the holidays.  As to the\nCockchafer, he was thoroughly frightened at the thought of having been\nseen there, and fully determined, even before Bramble's threat, never\nagain to cross its threshold.  After all, Stephen knew he had little\nenough to fear from that small braggadocio; Bramble had neither the wit\nnor the skill to use his discovery to any advantage.  For a day or two\nhe followed his adversary up and down the passages with cries of\n\"Potboy!\" till everybody was sick of the sound, and felt heartily glad\nwhen, one fine afternoon, Stephen quietly deposited his adversary on his\nback on the gravel of the playground.\n\nBut to return to the feud between Fifth and Sixth.\n\nThings after a little seemed to quiet down once more.  The exiled\nrioters, after a long and disheartening search, found rest for the soles\nof their feet in Tom Senior's study, which, though not nearly so\nconvenient, afforded them asylum during their pugilistic encounters.\n\nThe studious ones settled down once more to their work, and the near\napproach of the examinations presently absorbed all their attention.\n\nThe struggle for the Nightingale Scholarship naturally was regarded with\nthe most intense interest--not because it was the most important\nexamination of the year: it was not.  Not because it was worth 50 pounds\na year for three years.  That to most of the school was a minor\nconsideration.  It was as nothing to the fact that of the three\ncandidates for the scholarship one was a Sixth Form boy and two Fifth.\nIf only one of the latter could come out first, the Fifth and their\npartisans, all the school over, felt that the insult of the past month\nwould be wiped out, and the glory of the Form avenged for ever.  And it\nmust be confessed that the Sixth, however much they professed to ignore\nthe rivalry of their juniors, were equally anxious for their own man,\nand of late Loman had been working hard.  He had worked, so it was\nreported, during the holidays, and now, ever since term had begun, he\nhad remained more or less secluded in his study, or else, with a book\nunder his arm, had taken walks outside.\n\nOf course, the Sixth Form boy would win!  Who ever heard of a Fifth boy\nbeating a Sixth?  And yet, in Oliver and Wraysford, the Fifth, every one\nadmitted, had two strong men.  They would at least make a hard fight for\nthe prize.  The Sixth only hoped they would not run their man _too_\nclose, and so make the glory of his certain victory at all doubtful.\n\nLoman was not a favourite even with his own class-fellows, but they\ncould forgive anything now, provided he made sure of the Nightingale.\n\n\"He'll be all right!\" said Callonby to Wren one day, when the two\nhappened to hit on the topic of the hour; \"he's a great deal steadier\nthan he was last term.\"\n\n\"I wish he'd read indoors, then, and not be everlastingly trotting out\nwith his books.\"\n\n\"Oh!  I don't know; it's much jollier reading out of doors, if you can\ndo it.\"\n\n\"As long as he _does_ read.  Well, it will be a regular sell if he comes\nto grief; the Fifth will be intolerable.\"\n\n\"They're not far short of that now.  Hullo!\"  This exclamation was\nprovoked by the sight of Loman in the playground under their window.  He\nwas returning from one of his studious rambles, with his book under his\narm, slowly making for the school.\n\nThere was nothing in this to astonish the two boys as they looked down.\nWhat did astonish them was that he was walking unsteadily, with a queer,\nstupid look on his face, utterly unlike anything his schoolfellows had\never seen there before.  They watched him cross the playground and enter\nthe school-house.  Then Wren said, gravely, \"It's all up with the\nNightingale, at that rate.\"\n\n\"Looks like it,\" said the other, and walked away.  Loman was returning\nfrom one of his now frequent visits to the Cockchafer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20. A CRISIS.\n\nThe eventful day, which at the beginning of the term had seemed an age\naway, slowly but surely drew near.\n\nThis was Saturday.  On Monday the examination would be over, and in a\nweek the competitors would know their fates!\n\nSome of my readers may know the queer sensation one sometimes gets at\nthe approach of a long-looked-for and hardly-worked-for examination.\nFor a week or so you have quietly been counting up what you _do_ know.\nNow there breaks upon you an awful picture of what you do _not_ know,\nand with it the absolute conviction that what you do not know is exactly\nwhat you ought to know, and what you do know is no use at all.  It is\ntoo late to do anything.  You cannot get up in a day what it would take\nyou a fortnight to go through.  And it is not much good, now you are\nsure it is useless, to go over again what you have done.  You begin to\nfeel a sort of despair, which becomes, as the hours close in, positively\nreckless.  What do you care if you do miss?  What's the use of bothering\nany more about it?  It cannot be helped; why make yourself miserable?\nOnly, you would give worlds to have the thing all over.  Such at least\nwere the sensations which stirred in the breasts of Oliver Greenfield\nand Horace Wraysford as they sat somewhat dejectedly over their books in\nOliver's study that Saturday afternoon.\n\nThey had both worked hard since the holidays, generally together,\nneither concealing from the other what he had read or what he intended\nto read.  Very bad rivals were these two, for though each was intent on\nwinning the scholarship, each felt he would not break his heart if the\nother beat him, and that, as every one knows, is a most unheard-of piece\nof toleration.  Now, however, each felt he had had enough of it.  Oliver\nin particular was very despondent.  He slammed up his books suddenly,\nand said, \"I give it up; it's not a bit of use going on!\"\n\nWraysford pushed back his chair slowly, and said, not very cheeringly,\n\"Upon my word I think you're right, Noll.\"\n\n\"I've a good mind,\" said Oliver, looking very morose, \"to scratch, and\nleave you and Loman to fight it out.\"\n\n\"Don't be a jackass, Noll,\" replied Wraysford, half laughing.  \"That\n_would_ be a sensible thing to do!\"\n\n\"All very well for you to laugh,\" said Oliver, his brow clouding.  \"You\nknow you are well up and are going to win.\"\n\n\"I'm no better up than you are,\" said the other.\n\n\"You know you're going to win,\" repeated Oliver.\n\n\"I only wish I did,\" said Wraysford, with a sigh.\n\n\"Why,\" pursued Oliver, evidently bent on a melancholy tack, \"I assure\nyou, Wray, I've forgotten half even of what I did know.  I was going\nover some of those brutal Roman History dates in bed last night, for\ninstance, and I positively couldn't remember one.  Then I tried the map\nof Greece, but I was still worse there; I couldn't remember where one\nsingle place was except Athens and Corinth, and I'm sure I used to be\npretty well up in that.\"\n\n\"I expect you were half asleep at the time,\" suggested his friend.\n\n\"No, I wasn't; I couldn't sleep a wink.  I say, Wray, _wouldn't_ it be\njolly if we only knew now what the questions are going to be on Monday?\"\n\n\"Why don't you go and ask the Doctor?\" said Wraysford, laughing; \"he'd\nbe delighted to tell you.\"\n\n\"What a humbug you are, Wray!  I say, suppose we shut up work now and\nhave a turn on the river.  I'm certain it will do us more good than\ncracking our skulls here.\"\n\n\"Just what I had been thinking.  I'm game, and it can't make much\ndifference.\"\n\n\"I suppose Loman is grinding up to the last?\"\n\n\"I suppose so; I was almost in hopes he wouldn't keep it up.\"\n\n\"Never mind, it will all be over on Monday; that's a comfort!  Come\nalong, old man.  Suppose we get young Stee to cox us up to the lock and\nback.\"\n\nHue and cry was forthwith made for Stephen, but he was not to be found.\nHe was out, Paul said; at the post, or somewhere.\n\n\"Oh, all right; you can come and cox us yourself, youngster,\" said\nWraysford.\n\n\"Cox you!\" exclaimed Paul; \"why, ain't the Nightingale exam coming on,\nthen, on Monday?\"\n\n\"Of course it is!\"\n\n\"And you two going out to row!  I say, the Sixth will win it if you\ndon't look-out!\" said Paul, in a very concerned voice.\n\nIt was quite a revelation to the two boys to discover how great was the\ninterest taken by outsiders in the coming event.  Paul was in a great\nstate of alarm, and was actually inclined to refuse to aid and abet what\nhe imagined to be a wicked waste of precious opportunity, until, putting\nhis head into Loman's study, he found that the Sixth Form fellow was\nalso not at work.\n\nWhen Oliver and Wraysford appeared in boating flannels in the playground\nthey created as much sensation as if they had been ghosts.\n\n\"You don't mean to say you're going out, you fellows?\" exclaimed\nRicketts, one of the idle ones of the Fifth.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"But the Nightingale, I say?\"\n\n\"That's not till Monday.\"\n\n\"I know; but aren't you grinding for it?  I say, don't let them beat\nyou!  Hadn't you better work instead of going out?\"\n\nRicketts, by the way, had not done a stroke of work that he could\npossibly help all the term!\n\nAll the other Fifth Form fellows they encountered echoed more or less\nanxiously the same advice.  But the two friends were obdurate.  Threats,\npromises, entreaties, would not put them off their row up the river, and\nthey went on their way, leaving behind them an unusual gloom on the\nspirits of their dearest friends.\n\nThe only person who seemed really glad to see them leaving their work\nwas Bramble.  He, with his friend Padger, and a few other\nirreconcilables, were just returning from a rat-catching expedition, and\nthe sight of the Fifth Form heroes in boating costume filled them with\njoy.\n\n\"Hullo--my eye--hurrah!\" shouted Bramble, taking in the situation in a\nmoment.  \"There they go!  I hope they get drowned; don't you, Padger?\"\n\nPadger was understood to assent to this benevolent aspiration.\n\n\"Go it.  _You'll_ get the Nightingale!  I thought you would!  Hope you\nget drowned, do you hear!  Hurrah for the Sixth!\"\n\nAt this juncture Master Paul gave chase, and for a few moments Bramble\nand his friends were too much engaged to speak; but at last, when the\nchase was over, and further reprisals were out of the question, the hero\nof the Tadpoles summoned up all his remaining powers to yell:\n\n\"Yah boo, Nightingale!  Hope you get drowned!  Yah!\" after which he went\nhis way.\n\nThe two friends paddled quietly up the river.  They talked very little,\nbut both felt relieved to be away from their books.  As they went on\ntheir spirits rose, greatly to Paul's displeasure.  That young\ngentleman, immoderately jealous for the glory of the Fifth, was content\nas long as the two rowers remained grave and serious; he could then make\nhimself believe they were engaged in mental exercises favourable to\nMonday's examination.  But as soon as they began to whistle, and chaff\nhim and one another, and talk of their holiday adventures, Paul became\ndispleased, for they could not possibly do this and be inwardly\npreparing for the examination at the same time.\n\nHowever, he had to submit as best he could, and gave all his attention\nto steering them carefully, so that it should be no fault of his, at any\nrate, if they were prevented from showing up on the critical day.\n\n\"This old Shar isn't half such a jolly river as the Thames, is it,\nWray?\"\n\n\"Rather not!\" replied Wraysford, resting on his oar; \"and yet it's\npretty enough in parts.\"\n\n\"Oh, up at the weir?--yes.  But I'm out of love with weirs at present.\nI shudder every time I think of that one up the Thames.\"\n\n\"It wasn't pleasant, certainly,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"Pleasant!  Old man, if you hadn't been there it would have been a good\ndeal worse than unpleasant.  Poor Stee!\"\n\n\"Pull your left, Greenfield senior, or you'll be into the bank!\" sung\nout Paul.\n\nThey paddled on again until Gusset Lock came in sight.  There were very\nfew boats about; the season was, in fact, at an end, and the river,\nwhich a month or two ago had generally swarmed with boats just at this\npart on Saturday afternoons, looked quite deserted.\n\n\"Shall we go through the lock or turn round?\" inquired Paul.\n\n\"May as well turn, eh, Wray?\"\n\nPaul was about to obey the order and turn the boat, when, casting his\neyes on the bank, he started suddenly to his feet and exclaimed,\npointing towards the lock-house, \"Hullo!  I say, there's something up\nthere!\"\n\nThe two others looked round; something more lively than usual was\nundoubtedly taking place at old Mr Cripps's residence, to judge by the\nshouts and laughter which proceeded from the group of people assembled\nnear the door.\n\nFrom where they were the boys in the boat could not see what the nature\nof the excitement was, and therefore paddled on with a view to satisfy\ntheir curiosity.\n\nAs they came up to the lock Paul suddenly exclaimed, \"That's young\nGreenfield!\"\n\n\"What!\" said Oliver--\"Stephen?\"\n\n\"Yes, and--what _on earth_ are they doing to him?\"\n\nThe boat being low down under the bank, it was impossible to see what\nwas going on on the tow-path.  Oliver, however, having once heard\nStephen's name, ordered Paul to put them into the opposite bank quick,\nwhere they could land.\n\nWhile this was being done a shriek from the bank sent the blood suddenly\nto the faces of the two friends.  It was Stephen!  They dashed ashore,\nand in a moment were across the lock and on the spot.  The spectacle\nwhich met their eyes as they came up was a strange one.  The central\nfigure was the luckless Stephen, in the clutches of three or four\ndisreputable fellows, one of whom was Cripps the younger, who, with loud\nlaughter at the boy's struggles and brutal unconcern at his terror, were\nhalf dragging, half carrying him towards the water's edge.\n\nBeside them stood Loman, flushed, excited, and laughing loudly.  Poor\nStephen, very unlike himself, appeared to be utterly cowed and\nterrified, and uttered shriek upon shriek as his persecutors dragged him\nalong.\n\n\"Oh, don't!  Please, Cripps!  Don't let them, Loman--don't let them\ndrown me!\" he shouted.\n\nA laugh was the only answer.\n\nIt was at this moment, and just when, to all appearances, the boy was\nabout to be thrown into the water, that Oliver and Wraysford appeared on\nthe scene.\n\nTheir appearance was so sudden and unexpected that the fellows, even\nthough they did not know who the two boys were, were momentarily taken\naback and dropped their prey.\n\nWith a bound Oliver sprang furiously on Cripps, who happened to be\nnearest him, and before that respectable gentleman knew where he was,\nhad dealt him a blow which sent him staggering back in the utmost alarm\nand astonishment.  Wraysford, no less prompt, tackled one of the other\nblackguards, while Stephen, now released, and cured of his momentary\nterror by the appearance of the rescuers, did his share manfully with\none of the others.\n\nThe contest was short and sharp.  A pair of well-trained athletic\nschoolboys, with a plucky youngster to help them, are a match any day\nfor twice the number of half-tipsy cads.  In a minute or two the field\nwas clear of all but Cripps, who appeared, after his short experience,\nby no means disposed to continue the contest single-handed.  As for\nLoman, he had disappeared.\n\n\"What is all this?\" demanded Oliver, when at last, breathless and pale\nwith excitement, he could find words.\n\n\"Oh, Noll!\" cried Stephen, \"I'll tell you all about it.  But let's get\naway from here.\"\n\n\"No, I won't go!\" shouted Oliver--\"not till I know what it all means.\nYou fellow!\" added he, walking up to Cripps, \"you'd better speak or I'll\nthrash you!\"\n\nMr Cripps, who had had time to recover somewhat from his first\nsurprise, looked a little inclined to defy his young antagonist, but,\nthinking better of it, suddenly assumed his usual impudent swagger as he\nreplied, with a laugh, \"Come, I say, you _do_ do it well, you do!  It\nwas a joke--just a joke, young gentleman.  You've no occasion to flurry\nyourself; we wouldn't have hurt a hair of the young gentleman's head.\nAsk Mr Loman.\"\n\n\"Where's Loman?\" demanded Oliver.  \"Gone,\" said Stephen.  \"But I say,\nNoll, do come away.  I'll tell you all about it.  Do come.\"\n\nCripps laughed.  \"Don't you swallow all that young swell tells you.\nHe's a nice boy, he is, but--well, he'd better mind what he says, that's\nall!\"\n\n\"Do come away!\" once more entreated Stephen.\n\n\"Yes, do come away,\" laughed Cripps, mimicking the boy's tones.  \"When I\ncalls up at the school I'll let them all know what a nice young prig he\nis, coming down and drinking at my public-house and then turning round\non me.  Never fear!  _I'll_ let them know, my beauties!  I'll have a\ntalk with your Doctor and open his eyes for him.  Good-bye, you sneaking\nyoung--\"\n\n\"Look here!\" said Wraysford, quietly walking up to the blackguard in the\nmidst of this discourse, \"if you don't stop instantly you'll be sorry\nfor it.\"\n\nCripps stared a moment at the speaker, and at the first he held out.\nThen, without another word, he turned on his heel into the cottage,\nleaving the three boys standing in undisputed possession of the\ntow-path.\n\n\"Come on, how, old man!\" said Wraysford; \"we can't do any good by\nstaying here.\"\n\nOliver looked disposed to resist, and cast a glance at the cottage door\nby which Cripps had just vanished.  But he let himself be persuaded\neventually, and turned gloomily towards the boat.  Here Paul, who had\nbeen a witness of the _fracas_ on the tow-path, was waiting, ready to\nsteer home, and bursting with curiosity to hear all Stephen had to say.\n\nGreatly to his disgust, Oliver said, peremptorily, \"You'll have to walk\nhome, Paul; Stephen will steer.\"\n\n\"Why, you said I might steer.\"\n\nOliver was in no humour for an argument, so he gave Paul a light box on\nhis ears and advised him to go home quietly unless he wanted a\nthrashing, and not say a word to any one about what had occurred.\n\nPaul had nothing for it but sulkily to obey, and walk back.  At last the\nothers got on board and put off homeward.\n\n\"Now,\" said Oliver, presently, resting on his oar and bending forward\ntowards Stephen.\n\n\"Oh, Noll!\" began that unhappy youngster, \"I am so very, very sorry! it\nwas all--\"\n\n\"None of that,\" angrily interrupted the elder brother.  \"Just tell me\nhow it came about.\"\n\nStephen, quite cowed by his brother's angry manner, told his story\nshortly and hurriedly.\n\n\"Why,\" he said, \"you know I promised you never to go to the Cockchafer\nagain, and I didn't, but I thought I ought to see Cripps and give him\nback the bicycle-lamp.\"\n\n\"Young muff!\" ejaculated his brother.\n\n\"So,\" pursued Stephen, still more falteringly, \"I thought I'd come up\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"Well, go on, can't you?\" said Oliver, losing his temper at the poor\nboy's evident uneasiness.\n\n\"Cripps asked me into the cottage, and there were some fellows there,\nsmoking and drinking and playing cards.\"\n\n\"Was Loman one of them?\" put in Wraysford.\n\n\"I think so,\" said poor Stephen, who had evidently started his story in\nthe hope of keeping Loman's name quiet.\n\n\"_Think_ so, you young cad!\" cried Oliver.  \"Why can't you tell the\ntruth straight out?  Was he there or not?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was.  I did mean to tell the truth, Noll, really, only--only\nthere's no need to get Loman in a row.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"They made fun of me because I wouldn't smoke and play with them.  You\nknow I promised mother not to play cards, Noll.  I didn't mind that,\nthough, but when I wanted to go away they--that is, Cripps--wouldn't let\nme.  I tried to get away, but he stopped me, and they said they'd make\nme play.\"\n\n\"Who said?  Did Loman?\" inquired Oliver, again.  \"Why--yes,\" said\nStephen falteringly, \"he and the rest.  They held me down in a chair,\nand made me take hold of the cards, and one of them opened my mouth and\nshouted beastly words down into it--ugh!\"\n\n\"Was that Loman?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Stephen, relieved to be able to deny it.\n\n\"What did he do?\" demanded Oliver.\n\n\"They all--\"\n\n\"What did Loman do, I say?\" again asked Oliver.\n\nIt was no use trying to keep back anything.\n\n\"He pulled my ears, but not very hard.  Really I expect it was only fun,\nNoll.\"  This was said quite beseechingly.  \"I said I thought they were\nvery wicked to be doing what they did; but they only laughed at that,\nand called me a prig.\"\n\n\"Much better if you'd kept what you thought to yourself,\" said\nWraysford.  \"Well?\"\n\n\"Oh, then they did a lot of things to rile me, and knocked me about\nbecause I wouldn't drink their stuff, and they swore too.\"\n\n\"Did Loman swear?\"\n\n\"They all swore, I think,\" said Stephen; \"and then, you know, when I\nwouldn't do what they wanted they said they'd throw me in the river, and\nthen you fellows turned up.\"\n\n\"Did Loman tell them to throw you in the river?\" said Oliver, whose brow\nhad been growing darker and darker.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" exclaimed Stephen, \"he didn't, really!  I think he was sorry.\"\n\n\"Did he try to prevent it, then?\" asked Oliver.\n\n\"Well, no; I didn't hear him say--\" faltered Stephen; but Oliver shut\nhim up, and turning to Wraysford said, \"Wray, I shall thrash Loman.\"\n\n\"All serene,\" replied Wraysford; \"you'd better have it out to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, Noll!\" cried Stephen in great distress; \"don't fight, please.  It\nwas all my fault, for--\"\n\n\"Shut up, Stee,\" said Oliver, quietly, but not unkindly.  Then turning\nto Wraysford, he added, \"After tea, then, Wray, in the gymnasium.\"\n\n\"Right you are!\" replied his friend.\n\nAnd then, without another word, the three rowed back to Saint Dominic's.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21. THE FIGHT THAT DID NOT COME OFF.\n\nOn reaching Saint Dominic's the three boys discovered that the news of\ntheir afternoon's adventure had arrived there before them.  Paul,\ndespite his promise of secrecy, had not been able to refrain from\nconfiding to one or two bosom friends, in strict confidence, his version\nof the _fracas_ on the tow-path.  Of course the story became frightfully\ndistorted in its progress from mouth to mouth, but it flew like wildfire\nthrough Saint Dominic's all the same.\n\nWhen Oliver and his friend with Stephen entered the school-house, groups\nof inquisitive boys eyed them askance and whispered as they went by.  It\nseemed quite a disappointment to not a few that the three did not appear\ncovered with blood, or as pale as sheets, or with broken limbs.  No one\nknew exactly what had happened, but every one knew something had\nhappened, and it would have been much more satisfactory if the heroes of\nthe hour had had something to show for it.\n\nOliver was in no mood for gratifying the curiosity of anybody, and\nstalked off to his study in gloomy silence, attended by his chum and the\nanxious Stephen.\n\nA hurried council of war ensued.\n\n\"I must go and challenge Loman at once,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Let me go,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because most likely if you go you'll have a row in his study.  Much\nbetter wait and have it out decently in the gymnasium.  I'll go and tell\nhim.\"\n\nOliver yielded to this advice.\n\n\"Look sharp, old man,\" he said, \"that's all.\"\n\nWraysford went off on his mission without delay.\n\nHe found Loman in his study with his books before him.\n\n\"Greenfield senior wants me to say he'll meet you after tea in the\ngymnasium if you'll come there,\" said the ambassador.\n\nLoman, who was evidently prepared for the scene, looked up angrily as he\nreplied, \"Fight me?  What does he want to fight me for, I should like to\nknow!\"\n\n\"You know as well as I do,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"I know nothing about it, and what's more I'll have nothing to do with\nthe fellow.  Tell him that.\"\n\n\"Then you won't fight?\" exclaimed the astounded Wraysford.\n\n\"No, I won't to please him.  When I've nothing better to do I'll do it;\"\nand with the words his face flushed crimson as he bent it once more over\nhis book.\n\nWraysford was quite taken aback by this unexpected answer, and hesitated\nbefore he turned to go.\n\n\"Do you hear what I say?\" said Loman.  \"Don't you see I'm working?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Wraysford, \"I didn't think you were a coward.\"\n\n\"Think what you like.  Do you suppose I care?  If Greenfield wants so\nbadly to fight me, why didn't he do it last term when I gave him the\nchance?  Get out of my study, and tell him I'll have nothing to do with\nhim or any of your stuck-up Fifth!\"\n\nWraysford stared hard at the speaker and then said, \"I suppose you're\nafraid to fight _me_, either?\"\n\n\"If you don't clear out of my study I'll report you to the Doctor,\nthat's what I'll do,\" growled Loman.\n\nThere was no use staying, evidently; and Wraysford returned dejectedly\nto Oliver.\n\n\"He won't fight,\" he announced.\n\n\"Not fight!\" exclaimed Oliver.  \"Why ever not?\"\n\n\"I suppose because he's a coward.  He says because he doesn't choose.\"\n\n\"But he _must_ fight, Wray.  We must make him!\"\n\n\"You can't.  I called him a coward, and that wouldn't make him.  You'll\nhave to give it up this time, Noll.\"\n\nBut Oliver wouldn't hear of giving it up so easily.  He got up and\nrushed to Loman's study himself.  But it was locked.  He knocked, no one\nanswered.  He called through the keyhole, but there was no reply.\nEvidently Loman did not intend to fight, and Oliver returned crestfallen\nand disappointed to his study.\n\n\"It's no go,\" he said, in answer to his friend's inquiry.\n\n\"Oh, well, never mind,\" said Wraysford.  \"Even if you could have fought,\nI dare say it wouldn't have done much good, for he's such a sullen\nbeggar there would have been no making it up afterwards.  If I were you\nI wouldn't bother any more about it.  I'll let all the fellows know he\nrefused to fight you!\"\n\n\"What's the use of that?\" said Oliver.  \"Why tell them anything about\nit?\"\n\nBut tell them or not tell them, the fellows knew already.  It had oozed\nout very soon that a fight was coming off, and instantly the whole\nschool was in excitement.  For, however little some of them cared about\nthe personal quarrel between Oliver and Loman, a fight between Fifth and\nSixth was too great an event to be passed by unheeded.\n\nThe Fifth were delighted.  They knew their man could beat Loman any day\nof the week, and however much they had once doubted his courage, now it\nwas known he was the challenger every misgiving on that score was done\naway with.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said Ricketts to a small knot of his class-fellows, \"he\ncould finish him up easily in one round.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" chimed in another knowing one, \"Loman's got such a wretched knack\nof keeping up his left elbow, that he's not a chance.  A child could get\nin under his guard, I tell you; and as for wind, he's no more wind than\nan old paper bag!\"\n\n\"I wish myself it was a closer thing, as long as our man won,\" said Tom\nSenior, with a tinge of melancholy in his voice.  \"It will be such a\nmiserably hollow affair I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry it's not Wren, or Callonby, or one of them,\" said another of\nthese amiable warriors; \"there'd be some pleasure in chawing them up.\"\n\nAt this moment up came Pembury, with a very long face.\n\n\"It's no fight after all, you fellows,\" said he.  \"Loman funks it!\"\n\n\"What! he won't fight!\" almost shrieked the rest.  \"It must be wrong.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right, if it's wrong,\" snarled Pembury.  \"I tell you there's no\nfight; you can believe it or not as you like,\" and off he hobbled, in\nunusual ill-humour.\n\nThis was a sad blow to the Fifth.  They saw no comfort anywhere.  They\nflocked to Oliver's study, but he was not there, and Wraysford's door\nwas locked.  The news, however, was confirmed by other reporters, and in\ngreat grief and profound melancholy the Fifth swallowed their tea, and\nwondered if any set of fellows were so unlucky as they.\n\nBut their rage was as nothing to that of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles.\n\nThese amiable young animals had of course sniffed the battle from afar\nvery early in the evening, and, as usual, rushed into all sorts of\nextremes of enthusiasm on the subject.  A fight!  A fight between Fifth\nand Sixth!  A fight between Greenfield senior and a monitor!  Oh, it was\ntoo good to be true, a perfect luxury; something to be grateful for, and\nno mistake!\n\nOf course a meeting was forthwith assembled to gloat over the auspicious\nevent.\n\nBramble vehemently expressed his conviction that the Sixth Form man\nwould eat up his opponent, and went the length of offering to cut off\nhis own head and Padger's if it turned out otherwise.\n\nPaul and his friends, on the other hand, as vehemently backed the Fifth\nfellow.\n\n\"When's it to come off, I say?\" demanded Bramble.\n\n\"To-night, I should say, or first thing in the morning.\"\n\n\"Sure to be to-night.  My eye! won't Greenfield senior look black and\nblue after it!\"\n\n\"No, he won't,\" cried Paul.\n\n\"Turn him out!\" shouted Bramble.  \"No one wants you here; do we, Padger?\nGet yourself out of the meeting, you sneak!\"\n\n\"Get yourself out!\" retorted Paul.\n\nThe usual lively scene ensued, at the end of which the door suddenly\nopened, and a boy entered.\n\n\"Look sharp,\" he cried: \"it's half over by now.  They were--\"\n\nBut what the end of his sentence was to be, history recordeth not.  With\na simultaneous yell the youngsters rushed headlong from the room, down\nthe passages, out at the door, across the quadrangle, and into the\ngymnasium.  Alas! it was empty.  Only the gaunt parallel bars, and idle\nswings, and melancholy vaulting-horse.\n\nWith a yelp of anger the pack cried back, and made once more for the\nschool-house.  At the door they met Stephen.\n\n\"Where's the fight, young Greenfield?\" shouted Bramble.\n\n\"Nowhere,\" replied Stephen.\n\n\"What! not coming off?\" shrieked the youngsters.\n\n\"No,\" laconically answered Stephen.\n\n\"Has your brother funked it again?\" demanded Bramble, in his usual\nconciliatory way.\n\n\"He never funked, you young cad!\" retorted the young brother.\n\n\"Yes, he did, didn't he, Padger?  That time, you know, last term.  But I\nsay, Greenfield junior, why ever's the fight not coming off?\"\n\n\"Loman won't fight, that's why,\" said Stephen; and then, having had\nquite enough of catechising, turned on his heel and left the indignant\nyoungsters to continue their rush back to the Fourth Junior, there to\nspend an hour or so in denouncing the caddishness of everybody and to\nmake up by their own conflicts for the shortcomings of others.\n\nOliver meanwhile had settled down as best he could once more to work,\nand tried to forget all about the afternoon's adventures.  But for a\nlong time they haunted him and disturbed him.  Gradually, however, he\nfound himself cooling down under the influence of Greek accents and\nRoman history.\n\n\"After all,\" said he to Wraysford, \"if the fellow is a coward why need I\nbother?  Only I should have rather liked to thrash him for what he did\nto Stee.\"\n\n\"Never mind--thrash him over the Nightingale instead.\"\n\nThe mention of the Nightingale, however, did not serve to heighten\nOliver's spirits at all.\n\nHe turned dejectedly to his books, but soon gave up further study.\n\n\"You can go on if you like,\" said he to Wraysford.  \"I can't.  It's no\nuse.  I think I shall go to bed.\"\n\n\"What!  It's not quite nine yet.\"\n\n\"Is that all it is?  Never mind; good-night, old man.  I'm glad it will\nall be over on Monday.\"\n\nBefore Oliver went to bed he had a talk with Stephen in his study.  He\nsucceeded in putting pretty vividly before his young brother the\nposition in which he had placed himself by going down to the\npublic-house and associating with a man like Cripps.\n\n\"What I advise you is, to make a clean breast of it to the Doctor at\nonce.  If he hears of it any other way, you're done for.\"  Oliver\ncertainly had an uncompromising way of putting things.\n\n\"Oh, Noll, I never could!  I know I couldn't.  I say, will you?  You can\ntell him anything you like.\"\n\nOliver hesitated a moment, and then said, \"All serene; I'll do it.\nMind, I must tell him everything, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!  I say, do you think I'll be expelled?\"\n\n\"I hope not.  There's no knowing, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, Noll! what _shall_ I do?\"\n\n\"It's your only chance, I tell you.  If Cripps comes up and talks about\nit, or Loman tells, you're sure to be expelled.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Stephen, with a gulp, \"I suppose you'd better tell him,\nNoll.  Need I come too?\"\n\n\"No, better not,\" said Oliver.  \"I'll go and see if he's in his study\nnow.  You go up stairs, and I'll come and tell you what he says.\"\n\nStephen crawled dismally away, leaving his brother to fulfil his\nself-imposed task.\n\nOliver went straight to the Doctor's study.  The door stood half-open,\nbut the Doctor was not there.  He entered, and waited inside a couple of\nminutes, expecting that the head master would return; but no one came.\nAfter all, he would have to put off his confession of Stephen's\ndelinquencies till to-morrow; and, half relieved, half disappointed, he\nquitted the room.  As he came out he encountered Simon in the passage.\n\n\"Hullo, Greenfield!\" said that worthy; \"what have you been up to in\nthere?\"\n\n\"I want the Doctor,\" said Oliver; \"do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"If saw him go up stairs a minute ago; that is, I mean down stairs, you\nknow,\" said the lucid poet.\n\nThis information was sufficiently vague to determine Oliver not to\nattempt a wild-goose chase after the Doctor that night, so, bidding a\nhurried good-night to Simon, he took his way down the passage which led\nto Stephen's dormitory.\n\nHe had not, however, gone many steps when a boy met him.  It was Loman.\nThere was a momentary struggle in Oliver's breast.  Here was the--very\nopportunity which an hour or two ago he had so eagerly desired.  The\nwhole picture of that afternoon's adventures came up before his mind,\nand he felt his blood tingle as his eyes caught sight of Stephen's\npersecutor.  Should he pay off the score now?\n\nLoman saw him, and changed colour.  He evidently guessed what was\npassing through his enemy's mind, for a quick flush came to his face and\nan angry scowl to his brow.\n\nOliver for one moment slackened pace.  Then suddenly there came upon him\na vision of Stephen's appealing face as he interceded that afternoon for\nthe boy who had done him such mischief, and that vision settled the\nthing.\n\nHurriedly resuming his walk, Oliver passed Loman with averted eyes, and\nwent on his way.\n\n\"Well?\" said Stephen, in the midst of undressing, as his brother entered\nthe dormitory.\n\n\"He wasn't there.  I'll see him in the morning,\" said Oliver.\n\"Good-night, Stee.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Noll, old man!  I say, you are a brick to me!\" and as the\nboy spoke there was a tremble in his voice which went straight to his\nbrother's heart.\n\n\"You are a brick to me!\"  A pretty \"brick\" he had been, letting the\nyoungster drift anywhere--into bad company, into bad ways, without\nholding out a hand to warn him; and in the end coming to his help only\nby accident, and serving him by undertaking a task which would quite\npossibly result in his expulsion from the school.\n\nA brick, indeed!  Oliver went off to his own bed that night more\ndispirited and dissatisfied with himself than he had ever felt before.\nAnd all through his dreams his brother's troubled face looked up at him,\nand the trembling voice repeated, again and again, \"You are a brick to\nme--a brick to me!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22. THE NIGHTINGALE EXAMINATION.\n\nThe next morning early, before breakfast, Oliver joined the Doctor in\nhis study, and made a clean breast to him there and then of Stephen's\ndelinquencies.  He had evidently taken the right step in doing so, for,\nhearing it all thus frankly confessed by the elder brother, Dr Senior\nwas disposed to take a much more lenient view of the case than he would\nhad the information come to him through any other channel.\n\nBut at its best the offence was a grave one, and Oliver more than once\nfelt anxious at the sight of the head master's long face during the\nnarrative.  However, when it was all over his fears were at once\ndispelled by the doctor saying, \"Well, Greenfield, you've done a very\nproper thing in telling me all this; it is a straightforward as well as\na brotherly act.  Your brother seems to have been very foolish, but I\nhave no doubt he has got a lesson.  You had better send him to me after\nmorning service.\"\n\nAnd so, much relieved, Oliver went off and reported to the grateful\nStephen the success of his mission, and the two boys went off to the\nschool chapel together a good deal more happy than they had been the\nprevious day.\n\n\"I say,\" said Stephen, as they went along, \"I suppose you didn't say\nanything about Loman, did you?\"\n\n\"Of course not! he's no concern of mine,\" said Oliver, rather tartly.\n\"But look here, young 'un, I'm not going to let you fag any more for\nhim, or have anything to do with him.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Stephen, who had no desire to continue his\nacquaintance with his late \"proprietor.\"\n\n\"But the captain will row me, won't he?\"\n\n\"If he does I'll make that square.  You can fag for Wraysford if you\nlike, though, he wants a fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right!\" cried Stephen, delighted, \"that'll be jolly!  I like\nold Wray.\"\n\n\"Very kind of you,\" said a voice close by.\n\nIt was Wraysford himself, who had come in for this very genuine\ncompliment.\n\n\"Hullo!  I say, look here, Wraysford,\" said the beaming Stephen, \"I'm\ngoing to cut Loman and fag for you.  Isn't it jolly?\"\n\n\"Depends on whether I have you.  I don't want any Guinea-pigs in my\nstudy, mind.\"\n\nStephen's face fell.  For even such a privilege as fagging for Wraysford\nhe could not afford to sever the sacred ties which held him to the\nfellowship of the Guinea-pigs.  \"I really wouldn't kick-up shines,\" said\nhe, imploringly.\n\n\"You'd be a queer Guinea-pig if you didn't!\" was the flattering answer.\n\"And how many times a week would you go on strike, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Stephen, \"I'll never go on strike again; I don't like it.\"\n\nThe two friends laughed at this ingenuous admission, and then Wraysford\nsaid, \"Well, I'll have you; but mind, I'm awfully particular, and knock\nmy fags about tremendously, don't I, Noll?\"\n\n\"I don't mind that,\" said the delighted Stephen.  \"Besides, you've not\nhad a fag to knock about!\"\n\nAt that moment, however, the bell for morning chapel cut short all\nfurther talk for the present.  Stephen obeyed its summons for once in a\nsubdued and thankful frame of mind.  Too often had those weekly services\nbeen to him occasions of mere empty form, when with his head full of\nschool worries or school fun he had scarcely heard, much less heeded,\nwhat was said.\n\nTo-day, however, it was different.  Stephen was a sobered boy.  He had\npassed through perils and temptations from which, if he had escaped, it\nhad been through no merit of his own.  Things might have been far\ndifferent.  His life had been saved, so had his peace of mind, and now\neven the consequences of old transgressions had been lightened for him.\nWhat had he done to deserve all this?\n\nThis was the question which the boy humbly asked himself as he entered\nthe chapel that morning, and the Doctor's sermon fitted well with his\naltered frame of mind.\n\nIt was a sermon such as he had often heard before in that chapel; the\nwords struck him now with a new force which almost startled him.\n\"Forgetting those things which are behind--reaching forth unto those\nthings which are before,\"--this was the Doctor's text, and in the few\nsimple words in which he urged his hearers to lay the past, with all its\nburdens, and disappointments, and shame, upon Him in whom alone\nforgiveness is to be found, Stephen drank in new courage and hope for\nthe future, and in the thankfulness and penitence of his heart resolved\nto commit his way more honestly than ever to the best of all keeping,\ncompared with which even a brother's love is powerless.\n\nBefore the morning was over Stephen duly went to the Doctor, who talked\nto him very seriously.  I need not repeat the talk here.  Stephen was\nvery penitent, and had the good sense to say as little as possible; but\nwhen it was all over he thanked the Doctor gratefully, and promised he\nshould never have to talk to him for bad conduct again.\n\n\"You must thank your brother for my not dealing a great deal more\nseverely with the case,\" said Dr Senior; \"and I am quite ready to\nbelieve it will not occur again.  Now, good-bye.\"\n\nAnd off Stephen went, the happiest boy alive, determined more than ever\nto respect the Doctor's authority, and prove himself a model boy.\n\nSunday afternoon at Saint Dominic's was usually spent by the boys in\nfine weather, in strolling about in the gardens, or rambling into the\nwoods by the banks of the Shar.\n\nThis afternoon, however, was somewhat overcast, and a good many of the\nboys consequently preferred staying indoors to running the risk of\nspoiling their best hats in a shower.  Among those who kept the house\nwas Oliver, who, in reply to Wraysford's invitation to go out, pleaded\nthat he was not in the humour.\n\nThis indeed was the case, for, now that Stephen's affairs were settled,\nthe dread of the approaching Nightingale examination came back over him\nlike a nightmare, and made him quite miserable.  The nearer the hour of\ntrial came the more convinced did Oliver become that he stood no chance\nwhatever of winning, and with that conviction all the bright hopes of a\nuniversity course, and the prospects of after-success, seemed\nextinguished.\n\nOf course it was very ridiculous of him to worry himself into such a\nstate, but then, reader, he had been working just a little too hard, and\nit was hardly his fault if he was ridiculous.\n\nWraysford, though by no means in high spirits, kept his head a good deal\nbetter, and tried to enjoy his walk and forget all about books, as if\nnothing at all was going to happen to-morrow.  As for Loman, he was not\nvisible from morning till night, and a good many guessed, and guessed\ncorrectly, that he was at work, even on Sunday.\n\nThe small boys, not so much though, I fear, out of reverence for the day\nas for partisanship of the Fifth, were very indignant on the subject,\nand held a small full-dress meeting after tea, to protest against one of\nthe candidates taking such an unfair advantage over the others.\n\n\"He ought to be expelled!\" exclaimed Paul.\n\n\"All very well,\" said Bramble.  \"Greenfield senior's cramming too, he's\nbeen in all the afternoon.\"\n\n\"He's not cramming, he's got a headache!\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I dare say, don't you, Padger?  Got a headache--that's a nice\nexcuse for copying out of cribs on a Sunday.\"\n\n\"He doesn't use cribs, and I tell you he's not working!\" said Stephen,\nindignantly.\n\n\"Shut up, do you hear, or you'll get turned out, Potboy!\"\n\nThis was too much for Stephen, who left the assembly in disgust, after\nthreatening to take an early opportunity on the next day of giving his\nadversary \"one for himself,\" a threat which we may as well say at once\nhere he did not fail to carry out with his wonted energy.\n\nThe long Sunday ended at last--a Sunday spoiled to many of the boys of\nSaint Dominic's by distracting thoughts and cares--a day which many\nimpatiently wished over, and which some wished would never give place to\nthe morrow.\n\nBut that morrow came at last, and with it rose Oliver, strengthened and\nhopeful once more for the trial that lay before him.  He was early at\nWraysford's study, whom he found only just out of bed.\n\n\"Look alive, old man.  What do you say to a dip in the river before\nbreakfast?  We've got plenty of time, and it will wash off the cobwebs\nbefore the exam.\"\n\n\"All serene,\" said Wraysford, not very cheerily, though.  \"Anything's\nbetter than doing nothing.\"\n\n\"Why, Wray, I thought you weren't going to let yourself get down about\nit?\"\n\n\"I thought you weren't going to let yourself get up--why, you're quite\nfestive this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, a fellow can't do better than his best, and so as I have\ndone my best I don't mean to punish myself by getting in the blues.\"\n\n\"Pity you didn't make that resolution yesterday.  You were awfully glum,\nyou know, then; and now I've got my turn, you see.\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind, a plunge in the Shar will set you all right.\"\n\n\"Stee,\" said he, addressing his younger brother, who at that moment\nentered proudly in his new capacity as Wraysford's fag, \"mind you have\nbreakfast ready sharp by eight, do you hear? the best you can get out of\nWray's cupboard.  Come along, old boy.\"\n\nAnd so they went down to the river, Oliver in unusually good spirits,\nand Wraysford most unusually depressed and nervous.  The bathe was not a\ngreat success, for Wraysford evidently did not enjoy it.\n\n\"What's wrong, old man?\" said Oliver, as they walked back, \"aren't you\nwell?\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"But you're out of spirits.  It's odd that I was in dumps and you were\nin good spirits up to the fatal day, and now things are just reversed.\nBut, I say, you mustn't get down, you know, or it'll tell against you at\nthe exam.\"\n\n\"It strikes me every answer I give will tell against me.  All I hope is\nthat you get the scholarship.\"\n\n\"I mean to try, just like you and Loman.\"\n\nAnd so they went into breakfast, which was a solemn meal, and despite\nStephen's care in hunting up delicacies, not very well partaken of.\n\nIt seemed ages before the nine o'clock bell summoned them down to the\nFifth Form room.\n\nHere, however, the sympathy and encouragement of their class-fellows\namply served to pass the time till the examination began.\n\n\"Well, you fellows,\" cried Pembury, as the two entered, \"do you feel\nlike winning?\"\n\n\"Not more than usual,\" said Oliver.  \"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Oh, particularly cheerful, for I've nothing to do all day, I find.  I'm\nnot in for the Nightingale, or for the Mathematical Medal, or for the\nEnglish Literature.  Simon's in for that, you know, so there's no chance\nfor any one.\"\n\nSimon smiled very blandly at this side compliment.\n\n\"So you fellows,\" continued Tony, \"may command my services from morning\nto night if you like.\"\n\n\"Loman was grinding hard all yesterday,\" said Braddy.  \"I'm afraid he'll\nbe rather a hot one to beat.\"\n\n\"But we _must_ beat him, mind, you fellows,\" said Ricketts, calmly,\ncomprehending the whole class in his \"we.\"\n\n\"Why, Wray,\" said another, \"how jolly blue you look!  Don't go and funk\nit, old man, or it's all UP.\"\n\n\"Who's going to funk it?\" said Oliver, impatiently, on his friend's\nbehalf.  \"I tell you Wray will most likely win.\"\n\n\"Well, as long as one of you does,\" said Tom Senior, with noble\nimpartiality, \"we don't care which; do we, Braddy?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nSo, then, all this sympathy and encouragement were not for the two boys\nat all, but for their Form.  They might just as well have been two\ncarefully trained racehorses starting on a race with heavy odds upon\nthem.\n\nThe Doctor's entry, however, put an end to any further talk, and, as\nusual, a dead silence ensued after the boys had taken their seats.\n\nThe Doctor looked a little uneasy.  Doubtless he was impressed, too, by\nthe importance of the occasion.  He proceeded to call over the lists of\ncandidates for the different examinations in a fidgety manner, very\nunlike his usual self, and then turning abruptly to the class, said:\n\n\"The Mathematical Medal candidates will remain here for examination.\nThe English Literature and Nightingale Scholarship candidates will be\nexamined in the Sixth Form room.  Boys not in for either of these\nexaminations may go to their studies till the twelve o'clock bell rings.\nBefore you disperse, however,\"--and here the Doctor grew still more\nfidgety--\"I want to mention one matter which I have already mentioned in\nthe Sixth.  I mention it not because I suspect any boy here of a\ndishonourable act, but because--the matter being a mystery--I feel I\nmust not neglect the most remote opportunity of clearing it up.\"\n\nWhat on earth was coming?  It was as good as a ghost story, every one\nwas so spellbound and mystified.\n\n\"On Saturday evening I had occasion to leave my study for rather less\nthan five minutes, shortly after nine o'clock.  I had been engaged in\ngetting together the various papers of questions for to-day's\nexaminations, and left them lying on the corner of the table.  On\nreturning to my study--I had not been absent five minutes--I found that\none of the papers--one of the Nightingale Scholarship papers, which I\nhad only just copied out, was missing.  If I were not perfectly sure the\nfull number was there before I left the room, I should conclude I was\nmistaken, but of that I am sure.  I just wish to ask this one question\nhere, which I have already asked in the Sixth.  Does any boy present\nknow anything about the missing paper?\"\n\nYou might have heard a pin drop as the Doctor paused for a reply.\n\n\"No?  I expected not; I am quite satisfied.  You can disperse, boys, to\nyour various places.\"\n\n\"What a fellow the Doctor is for speeches, Wray,\" said Oliver, as he and\nhis friend made their way to the Sixth Form room.\n\n\"Yes.  But that's a very queer thing about the paper, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's certain to have mislaid it somewhere.  It's a queer thing\nsaying anything about it; for it looks uncommonly as if he suspected\nsome one.\"\n\n\"So it does.  Oh, horrors! here we are at the torture-chamber!  I wish\nit was all over!\"\n\nThey entered the Sixth Form room, which was regularly cleared for\naction.  One long desk was allotted to the three Nightingale candidates,\ntwo others to the English Literature boys, and another to the\ncompetitors in a Sixth Form Greek verse contest.\n\nLoman was already in his place, waiting with flushed face for the ordeal\nto begin.  The two friends took their seats without vouchsafing any\nnotice of their rival, and an uncomfortable two minutes ensued, during\nwhich it seemed as if the Doctor were never to arrive.\n\nHe did arrive at last, however, bringing with him the examination papers\nfor the various classes.\n\n\"Boys for the Greek verse prize come forward.\"\n\nWren, Raleigh, Winter, and Callonby advanced, and received each one his\npaper.\n\n\"Boys for the Nightingale Scholarship come forward.\"\n\nThe three competitors obeyed the summons, and to each was handed a\npaper.\n\nIt was not in human nature to forbear glancing hurriedly at the\nmomentous questions, as each walked slowly back to his seat.  The effect\nof that momentary glance was very different on the three boys.\nWraysford's face slightly lengthened, Loman's grew suddenly aghast,\nOliver's betrayed no emotion whatever.\n\n\"Boys for the English Literature prize come forward.\"\n\nThese duly advanced and were furnished, and then silence reigned in the\nroom, broken only by the rapid scratching of pens and the solemn tick of\nthe clock on the wall.\n\nReader, you doubtless know the horrors of an examination-room as well as\nI do.  You know what it is to sit biting the end of your pen, and\nglaring at the ruthless question in front of you.  You know what it is\nto dash nervously from question to question, answering a bit of this and\na bit of that, but lacking the patience to work steadily down the list.\nAnd you have experienced doubtless the aggravation of hearing the pen of\nthe man on your right flying along the paper with a hideous squeak,\nnever stopping for a moment to give you a chance.  And knowing all this,\nthere is no need for me to describe the vicissitudes of this particular\nday of ordeal at Saint Dominic's.\n\nThe work went steadily on from morning to afternoon.  More than one\nanxious face darted now and then nervous glances up at the clock, as the\nhour of closing approached.\n\nLoman was one of them.  He was evidently in difficulties, and the Fifth\nForm fellows, who looked round occasionally from their English\nLiterature papers, were elated to see their own men writing steadily and\nhard, while the Sixth man looked all aground.  There was one boy,\nhowever, who had no time for such observations.  That was Simon.  He had\ngot hold of a question which was after his own heart, and demanded every\nsecond of his attention--\"Describe, in not more than twelve lines of\nblank verse, the natural beauties of the River Shar.\"  Here was a chance\nfor the _Dominican_ poet!\n\n  \"The Shar is a very beautiful stream,\n  Of the Ouse a tributary;\n  Up at Gusset Weir it's prettiest, I ween,\n  Because there the birds sing so merry.\"\n\nThese four lines the poet styled, \"Canto One.\"  Cantos 2, 3, and 4 were\nmuch of the same excellence, and altogether the effusion was in one of\nSimon's happiest moods.  Alas! as another poet said, \"Art is long, time\nis fleeting.\"  The clock pointed to three long before the bard had\npenned his fifth canto; and sadly and regretfully he and his\nfellow-candidates gathered together and handed in their papers, for\nbetter or worse.\n\nAmong the last to finish up was Oliver, who had been working hammer and\ntongs during the whole examination.\n\n\"How did you get on?\" said Wraysford, as they walked back to the Fifth.\n\n\"Middling, not so bad as I feared; how did you?\"\n\n\"Not very grand, I'm afraid; but better than I expected,\" said\nWraysford.  \"But I say, did you see how gravelled Loman seemed?  I fancy\nhe didn't do very much.\"\n\n\"So I thought; but I hadn't time to watch him much.\"\n\nIn the Fifth there was a crowd of questioners, eager to ascertain how\ntheir champions had fared; and great was their delight to learn that\nneither was utterly cast down at his own efforts.\n\n\"You fellows are regular bricks if you get it!\" cried Ricketts.\n\n\"It'll be the best thing that has happened for the Fifth for a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" said Simon, suddenly, addressing Oliver in a peculiarly\nknowing tone, \"wasn't it funny, that about the Doctor losing the paper?\nJust the very time I met you coming out of his study, you know, on\nSaturday evening.  But of course I won't say anything.  Only wasn't it\nfunny?\"\n\nWhat had come over Oliver, that he suddenly turned crimson, and without\na single word struck the speaker angrily with his open hand on the\nforehead?\n\nWas he mad? or could it possibly be that--\n\nBefore the assembled Fifth could recover from their astonishment or\nconjecture as to the motive for this sudden exhibition of feeling, he\nturned abruptly to the door and quitted the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23. A TURN OF THE TIDE.\n\nAn earthquake could hardly have produced a greater shock than Oliver's\nstrange conduct produced on the Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's.  For a\nmoment or two they remained almost stupefied with astonishment, and then\nrose a sudden clamour of tongues on every hand.\n\n\"What can he mean?\" exclaimed one.\n\n\"Mean!  It's easy enough to see what he means,\" said another, \"the\nhypocrite!\"\n\n\"I should never have thought Greenfield senior went in for that sort of\nthing!\"\n\n\"Went in for what sort of thing?\" cried Wraysford, with pale face and in\na perfect tremble.\n\n\"Why--cheating!\" replied the other.\n\n\"You're a liar to say so!\" shouted Wraysford, walking rapidly up to the\nspeaker.\n\nThe other boys, however, intervened, and held the indignant Wraysford\nback.\n\n\"I tell you you're a liar to say so!\" again he exclaimed.  \"He's not a\ncheat, I tell you; he never cheated.  You're a pack of liars, all of\nyou!\"\n\n\"I say, draw it mild, Wray, you know,\" interposed Pembury.  \"You needn't\ninclude me in your compliments.\"\n\nWraysford glared at him a moment and then coloured slightly.\n\n\"_You_ don't call Oliver a cheat?\" he said, inquiringly.\n\n\"I shouldn't till I was cock-sure of the fact,\" replied the cautious\neditor of the _Dominican_.\n\n\"Do you mean to say you aren't sure?\" said Wraysford.\n\nPembury vouchsafed no answer, but whistled to himself.\n\n\"All I can say is,\" said Bullinger, who was one of Wraysford's chums,\n\"it looks uncommonly ugly, if what Simon says is true.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word that ass says.\"\n\n\"Oh, but,\" began Simon, with a most aggravating cheerfulness, \"I assure\nyou I'm not telling a lie, Wraysford.  I'm sorry I said anything about\nit.  I never thought there would be a row about it.  I promise I'll not\nmention it to anybody.\"\n\n\"You blockhead! who cares for your promises?  I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"Well, I know I met Greenfield senior coming out of the Doctor's study\non Saturday evening, about five minutes past nine.  I'm positive of\nthat,\" said Simon.\n\n\"And I suppose he had the paper in his hand?\" sneered Wraysford, looking\nvery miserable.\n\n\"No; I expect he'd put it in his pocket, you know, at least, that is, I\nwould have.\"\n\nThis candid admission on the part of the ingenious poet was too much for\nthe gravity of one or two of the Fifth.  Wraysford, however, was in no\nlaughing mood, and went off to his study in great perturbation.\n\nHe could not for a moment believe that his friend could be guilty of\nsuch a dishonourable act as stealing an examination paper, and his\nimpulse was to go at once to Oliver's study and get the suspicions of\nthe Fifth laid there and then.  But the fear of seeming in the least\ndegree to join in those suspicions kept him back.  He tried to laugh the\nthing to scorn inwardly, and called himself a villain and a traitor\ntwenty times for admitting even the shadow of a doubt into his own mind.\nYet, as Wraysford sat that afternoon and brooded over his friend's new\ntrouble, he became more and more uncomfortable.\n\nWhen on a former occasion the fellows had called in question Oliver's\ncourage, he had felt so sure, so very sure the suspicion was a\ngroundless one, that he had never taken it seriously to heart.  But\nsomehow this affair was quite different.  What possible object would\nSimon, for instance, have for telling a deliberate lie? and if it had\nbeen a lie, why should Oliver have betrayed such confusion on hearing\nit?\n\nThese were questions which, try all he would, Wraysford could not get\nout of his mind.\n\nWhen Stephen presently came in, cheery as ever, and eager to hear how\nthe examination had gone off, the elder boy felt an awkwardness in\ntalking to him which he had never experienced before.  As for Stephen,\nhe put down the short, embarrassed answers he received to Wraysford's\nown uneasiness as to the result of the examination.  Little guessed the\nboy what was passing in the other's mind!\n\nThere was just one hope Wraysford clung to.  That was that Oliver should\ncome out anywhere but first in the result.  If Loman, or Wraysford\nhimself, were to win, no one would be able to say his friend had\nprofited by a dishonourable act; indeed, it would be as good as proof he\nhad not taken the paper.\n\nAnd yet Wraysford felt quite sick as he called to mind the unflagging\nmanner in which Oliver had worked at his paper that morning, covering\nsheet upon sheet with his answers, and scarcely drawing in until time\nwas up.  It didn't look like losing, this.\n\nHe threw himself back in his chair in sheer misery.  \"I would sooner\nhave done the thing myself,\" groaned he to himself, \"than Oliver.\"  Then\nsuddenly he added, \"But it's not true!  I'm certain of it!  He couldn't\ndo it!  I'll never believe it of him!\"\n\nPoor Wraysford!  It was easier to say the generous words than feel them.\n\nPembury looked in presently with a face far more serious and overcast\nthan he usually wore.\n\n\"I say, Wray,\" said he, in troubled tones, \"I'm regularly floored by all\nthis.  Do you believe it?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" replied Wraysford, but so sadly and hesitatingly that had\nhe at once confessed he did, he could not have expressed his meaning\nmore plainly.\n\n\"I'd give anything to be sure it was all false,\" said Pembury, \"and so\nwould a lot of the fellows.  As for that fool Simon--\"\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed Wraysford, fiercely, \"the fellow ought to be kicked\nround the school.\"\n\n\"He's getting on that way already, I fancy,\" said Pembury.  \"I was\nsaying I'd think nothing at all about it if what he says was the only\nthing to go by, but--well, you saw what a state Greenfield got into\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Maybe he was just in a sudden rage with the fellow for thinking of such\na thing,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"It looked like something more than rage,\" said Pembury, dismally,\n\"something a good deal more.\"\n\nWraysford said nothing, but fidgeted in his chair.  A long silence\nfollowed, each busy with his own thoughts and both yearning for any sign\nof hope.  \"I don't see what good it could have done him if he did take\nthe paper.  He'd have no time to cram it up yesterday.  He was out with\nyou, wasn't he, all the afternoon?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Wraysford, not looking up, \"he had a headache and stayed in.\"\n\nPembury gave a low whistle of dismay.\n\n\"I say, Wray,\" said he, presently, \"it really does look bad, don't you\nthink so yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" said Wraysford, with a groan; \"I'm quite\nbewildered.\"\n\n\"It's no use pretending not to see what's as plain as daylight,\" said\nPembury, as he turned and hobbled away.\n\nThe Fifth meanwhile had been holding a sort of court-martial on the\naffair.\n\nSimon was made to repeat his story once more, and stuck to it too, in\nspite of all the browbeating he got.\n\n\"What makes you so sure of the exact time?\" asked one of his\ninquisitors.\n\n\"Oh, because, you know, I wanted to get off a letter by the post, and\nthought I was in time till I saw the clock opposite the Doctor's study\nsaid five minutes past.\"\n\n\"Did Greenfield say anything to you when he saw you?\" some one else\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, yes, he asked me if I knew where the Doctor was.\"\n\n\"Did you tell him?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I said he'd gone down to the hall or somewhere.\"\n\n\"And did Greenfield go after him?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you know, he went off the other way as quick as he could,\" said\nSimon, in a voice as though he would say, \"How can you ask such an\nabsurd question?\"\n\n\"Did you ask him what he wanted in the study?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but of course he didn't tell me--not likely.  But I say, I\nsuppose we're sure to win the Nightingale now, aren't we?  Mind, I'm not\ngoing to tell anybody, because, of course, it's a secret.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you miserable blockhead, unless you want to be kicked!\"\nshouted Bullinger.  \"No one wants to know what you're going to do.\nYou've done mischief enough already.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I didn't mean, you know,\" said the poet; \"all I said was I\nmet him coming--\"\n\n\"Shut up, do you hear? or you'll catch it!\" once more exclaimed\nBullinger.\n\nThe wretched Simon gave up further attempts to explain himself.  Still\nwhat he had said, in his blundering way, had been quite enough.\n\nThe thing was beyond a doubt; and as the Fifth sat there in judgment, a\nsense of shame and humiliation came over them, to which many of them\nwere unused.\n\n\"I know this,\" said Ricketts, giving utterance to what was passing in\nthe minds of nearly all his class-fellows, \"I'd sooner have lost the\nscholarship twenty times over than win it like this.\"\n\n\"Precious fine glory it will be if we do get it!\" said Braddy.\n\n\"Unless Wray wins,\" suggested Ricketts.\n\n\"No such luck as that, I'm afraid,\" said Bullinger.  \"That's just the\nworst of it.  He's not only disgraced us, but he's swindled his best\nfriend.  It's a blackguard shame!\" added he, fiercely.\n\n\"At any rate, Loman is out of it, from what I hear; he got regularly\nstuck in the exam.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" said Ricketts, \"I'd sooner have had Loman take the\nscholarship and our two men nowhere at all, than this.\"\n\nThere was nothing more than this to be said, assuredly, to prove the\ndisgust of the Fifth at the conduct of their class-fellow.\n\n\"I suppose Greenfield will have the grace to confess it, now it's all\ncome out,\" said Ricketts.\n\n\"If he doesn't I fancy we can promise him a pretty hot time of it among\nus,\" said Braddy.\n\nOne or two laughed at this, but to most of those present the matter was\npast a joke.\n\nFor it must be said of the Dominicans--and I think it may be said of a\ngood many English public schoolboys besides--that, however foolish they\nmay have been in other respects, however riotous, however jealous of one\nanother, however well satisfied with themselves, a point of honour was a\npoint which they all took seriously to heart.  They could forgive a\nschoolfellow for doing a disobedient act sometimes, or perhaps even a\nvicious act, but a cowardly or dishonourable action was a thing which\nnothing would excuse, and which they felt not only a disgrace to the boy\nperpetrating it, but a disgrace put upon themselves.\n\nHad Oliver been the most popular boy in the school it would have been\nall the same.  As it was, he was a long way from being the most popular.\nHe never took any pains to win the good opinion of his fellows.  When,\nby means of some achievement in which he excelled, he had contrived (as\nin the case of the cricket match last term) to bring glory on his school\nand to make himself a hero in the eyes of Saint Dominic's, he had been\nwont to take the applause bestowed on him with the utmost indifference,\nwhich some might even construe into contempt.  And in precisely the same\nspirit would he take the displeasure which he now and then managed to\nincur.\n\nBoys don't like this.  It irritates them to see their praise or blame\nmade little of; and for this reason, if for no other, Oliver would\nhardly have been a favourite.\n\nBut there was another reason.  Now that the Fifth found their faith in\nGreenfield senior rudely dashed to the ground, they were not slow to\nrecall the unpleasant incidents of last term, when, by refusing to\nthrash Loman, he had discredited the whole Form, and laid himself under\nthe suspicion of cowardice.\n\nMost of the fellows had at the time of the Nightingale examination\neither forgotten, or forgiven, or repented of their suspicions, and,\nindeed, by his challenge to Loman the previous Saturday Oliver had been\nconsidered quite to have redeemed his reputation in this respect.  But\nnow it all came up again.  A fellow who could do a cowardly deed at one\ntime could do a mean one at another.  If one was natural to his\ncharacter, so was the other, and in fact one explained the other.  He\nwas mean when he showed himself a coward last term.  He was a coward\nwhen he did a mean act this term.\n\nWhat wonder, in these circumstances, if the Fifth felt sore, very sore\nindeed, on the subject of Oliver Greenfield?\n\nTo every one's relief, he did not put in an appearance again that day.\nHe kept his study, and Paul brought down word at prayer time that he had\na headache and had gone to bed.\n\nAt this the Fifth smiled grimly and said nothing.\n\nNext morning, however, Oliver turned up as usual in his place.  He\nlooked pale, but otherwise unconcerned, and those who looked-for traces\nof shame and self-abasement in his face were sorely disappointed.\n\nHe surely must have known or guessed the resolution the Fifth had come\nto with regard to him; but from his unabashed manner he was evidently\ndetermined not to take it for granted till the hint should be given\npretty clearly.\n\nOn Ricketts, whose desk was next to that of Oliver, fell the task of\nfirst giving this hint.\n\n\"How did you get on yesterday in the English Literature?\" asked Oliver.\n\nRicketts' only answer was to turn his back and begin to talk to his\nother neighbour.\n\nThose who were watching this incident noticed a sudden flush on Oliver's\ncheek as he stared for an instant at his late friend.  Then with an\neffort he seemed to recover himself.\n\nHe did not, however, attempt any further conversation either with\nRicketts or his other neighbour, Braddy, who in a most marked manner had\nmoved as far as possible away from him.  On the contrary, he coolly\navailed himself of the extra room on the desk and busied himself\nsilently with the lessons for the day.\n\nBut he now and then looked furtively up in the direction of Wraysford,\nwho was seated at an opposite desk.  The eyes of the two friends met now\nand then, and when they did each seemed greatly embarrassed.  For\nWraysford, after a night's heart-searching, had come to the\ndetermination not, after all, to cut his friend; and yet he found it\nimpossible to feel and behave towards him as formerly.  He tried very\nhard indeed not to appear constrained, but the more he tried the more\nembarrassed he felt.  After class he purposely walked across the room to\nmeet his old chum.\n\n\"How are you?\" he said, in a forced tone and manner utterly unlike his\nold self.\n\nIt was a ridiculous and feeble remark to make, and it would have been\nfar better had he said nothing.  Oliver stared at him for a moment in a\nperplexed way, and then, without answering the question, walked\nsomewhere else.\n\nWraysford was quite conscious of his own mistake; still it hurt him\nsorely that his well-meant effort, which had cost him so much, should be\nthus summarily thrust aside without a word.  For the first time in his\nlife he felt a sense of resentment against his old friend, the beginning\nof a gap which was destined to become wider as time went on.\n\nThe only person in the room who did meet Oliver on natural ground was\nthe poetic Simon.  To him Oliver walked up and said, quietly, \"I beg\nyour pardon for hitting you yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Simon, with a giggle.  \"Oh, it's all right, Greenfield, you\nknow; I never meant to let it out.  It'll soon get hushed up; I don't\nintend to let it go a bit farther.\"\n\nThe poet was too much carried away by the enthusiasm of his own\nmagnanimity to observe that he was in imminent risk, during the delivery\nof this speech, of another blow a good deal more startling than that of\nyesterday.  When he concluded, he found Oliver had left him to himself\nand hurriedly quitted the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24. THE RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION.\n\nThe adventures of the morning did not certainly tend to make the Fifth\nthink better of Oliver Greenfield.\n\nHad he appeared before them humble and penitent, there were some who\neven then might have tried to forgive him and forget what was done.  But\ninstead of that he was evidently determined to brazen the thing out, and\nhad begun by snubbing the very fellows whom he had so deeply injured.\n\nWraysford felt specially hurt.  It had cost him a good deal to put on a\nfriendly air and speak as if nothing had happened; and to find himself\nscorned for his pains and actually avoided by the friend who had wronged\nhim was too much.  But even that would not have been so bad, had not\nOliver immediately gone and made up to Simon before all the class.\n\nWraysford did not remain to join in the chorus of indignation in which\nthe others indulged after morning school was over.  He left them and\nstrolled out dismally into the playground.\n\nHe must do something!  He must know one way or the other what to think\nof Oliver.  Even now he would gladly believe that it was all a dream,\nand that nothing had come between him and his old friend.  But the more\nhe pondered it the more convinced he became it was anything but a dream.\n\nHe wandered unconsciously beyond the playground towards the woods on the\nside of the Shar, where he and Oliver had walked so often in the old\ndays.\n\nThe old days!  It was but yesterday that they had last walked there.\nYet what an age ago it seemed! and how impossible that the old days\nshould ever come back again.\n\nHe had not got far into the wood when he heard what seemed to him\nfamiliar footsteps ahead of him.  Yesterday he would have shouted and\nwhistled and called on the fellow to hold hard.  But now he had no such\ninclination.  His impulse was to turn round and go back.\n\n\"And yet,\" thought he, \"why should _I go_ back?  If it is Oliver, what\nhave _I_ to feel ashamed of?\"\n\nAnd so he advanced.  The boy in front of him was walking slowly, and\nWraysford soon came in view of him.  As he expected, it was Oliver.\n\nAt the sight of his old friend, wandering here solitary and listless,\nall Wraysford's old affection came suddenly back.  At least he would\nmake one more effort.  So he quickened his pace.  Oliver turned and saw\nhim coming.  But he did not wait.  He walked on slowly as before,\napparently indifferent to the approach of anybody.\n\nThis was a damper certainly to Wraysford.  At least Oliver might have\nguessed why his friend was coming after him.\n\nIt was desperately hard to know how to begin a conversation.  Oliver\ntrudged on, sullen and silent, in anything but an encouraging manner.\nStill, Wraysford, now his mind was made up, was not to be put from his\npurpose.\n\n\"Noll, old man,\" he began, in as much of his old tone and manner as he\ncould assume.\n\n\"Well?\" said Oliver, not looking up.\n\n\"Aren't we to be friends still?\"\n\nThe question cost the speaker a hard effort, and evidently went home.\nOliver stopped short in his walk, and looking full in his old friend's\nface, said, \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Because I'm afraid we are not friends at this moment.\"\n\n\"And whose fault is that?\" said Oliver, scornfully.\n\nThe question stung Wraysford as much as it amazed him.  Was he, then, of\nall the fellows in the school, to have an explanation thus demanded of\nhim from one who had done him the most grievous personal wrong one\nschoolboy well could do to another?\n\nHis face flushed as he replied slowly, \"Your fault, Greenfield; how can\nyou ask?\"\n\nOliver gave a short laugh very like contempt, and then turned suddenly\non his heel, leaving Wraysford smarting with indignation, and finally\nconvinced that between his old friend and himself there was a gulf which\nnow it would be hard indeed to bridge over.\n\nHe returned moodily to the school.  Stephen was busy in his study\ngetting tea.\n\n\"Hullo, Wray,\" he shouted, as the elder boy entered; \"don't you wish it\nwas this time to-morrow?  I do, I'm mad to hear the result!\"\n\n\"Are you?\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"Yes, and so are you, you old humbug.  Noll says he thinks he did pretty\nwell, and that you answered well too.  I say, what a joke if it's a dead\nheat, and you both get bracketed first.\"\n\n\"Cut away now,\" said Wraysford, as coolly as he could, \"and don't make\nsuch a row.\"\n\nThere was something unusual in his tone which surprised the small boy.\nHe put it down, however, to worry about the examination, and quietly\nwithdrew as commanded.\n\nThe next day came at last.  Two days ago, in the Fifth Form, at any\nrate, it would have been uphill work for any master to attempt to\nconduct morning class in the face of all the eagerness and enthusiasm\nwith which the result of the examinations would have been looked-for.\nNow, however, there was all the suspense, indeed, but it was the\nsuspense of dread rather than triumph.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Ricketts to Pembury, after the two had been talking\nover the affair for the twentieth time.  \"Never mind; and there's just\nthis, Tony, if Wray is only second, it will be a splendid win for the\nFifth all the same.\"\n\n\"I see nothing splendid in the whole concern,\" said Pembury.  And that\nwas the general feeling.\n\nOliver entered and took his accustomed seat in silence.  No one spoke to\nhim, many moved away from him, and nearly all favoured him with a long\nand unfriendly stare.\n\nAll these things he took unmoved.  He sat coolly waiting for class to\nbegin, and when it did begin, any one would have supposed he was the\nonly comfortable and easy-minded fellow in the room.  The lesson dragged\non languidly that morning.  Most of the boys seemed to regard it as\nsomething inflicted on them to pass the time rather than as a serious\neffort of instruction.  The clock crawled slowly on from ten to eleven,\nand from eleven to half-past, and every one was glad when at last Mr\nJellicott closed his book.  Then followed an interval of suspense.  The\nDoctor was due with the results, and was even now announcing them in the\nSixth.  What ages it seemed before his footsteps sounded in the passage\noutside the Fifth!\n\nAt last he entered, and a hush fell over the class.  One or two glanced\nquickly up, as though they hoped to read their fate in the head master's\nface.  Others waited, too anxious to stir or look up.  Others groaned\ninwardly with a sort of prophetic foresight of what was to come.\n\nThe Doctor walked up to the desk and unfolded his paper.\n\nWraysford looked furtively across the room to where his old friend sat.\nThere was a flush in Oliver's face as he followed the Doctor with his\neyes; he was breathing hard, Wraysford could see, and the corners of his\nmouth were working with more than ordinary nervousness.\n\n\"Alas!\" thought Wraysford, \"I don't envy him his thoughts!\"\n\nThe Doctor began to speak.\n\n\"The following are the results of the various examinations held on\nMonday.  English Literature--maximum number of marks 100. 1st,\nBullinger, 72 marks; 2nd, West, 68; 3rd, Maybury, 51; 4th, Simon, 23.\nI'm afraid, Simon, you were a little too venturesome entering for an\nexamination like this.  Your paper was a very poor performance.\"\n\nSimon groaned and gulped down his astonishment.\n\n\"I say,\" whispered he to Oliver, who sat in front of him, \"I know it's a\nmistake: you know I wrote five cantos about the Shar--good too.  He's\nlost that.  I say, had I better tell him?\"\n\nOliver vouchsafing no reply, the unfortunate poet merely replied to the\nhead master's remarks, \"Yes, sir,\" and then subsided, more convinced\nthan ever that Saint Dominic's was not worthy of him.\n\n\"The Mathematical Medal--maximum number of marks 80. 1st, Heath, 65;\n2nd, Price, 54; 3rd, Roberts, 53.  Heath's answers, I may say, were very\ngood, and the examiners have specially commended him.\"\n\nHeath being a Sixth Form man, this information was absolutely without\ninterest to the Fifth, who wondered why the Doctor should put himself\nout of the way to announce it.\n\n\"The Nightingale Scholarship.\"\n\nAh, now!  There was a quick stir, and then a deeper silence than ever as\nthe Doctor slowly read out, \"The maximum number of marks possible, 120.\nFirst, Greenfield, Fifth Form, 112 marks.  And I must say I and the\nexaminers are astonished as well as highly gratified with this really\nbrilliant performance.  Greenfield, I congratulate you as well as your\nclass-fellows on your success.  It does you the very greatest credit!\"\n\nA dead silence followed this eulogium.  Those who watched Oliver saw his\nface first glow, then turn pale, as the Doctor spoke.  He kept his eyes\nsteadily fixed on the paper in the head master's hand, as if waiting for\nwhat was to follow.\n\nThe Doctor went on, \"Second, Wraysford, Fifth Form, 97 marks, also a\ncreditable performance.\"\n\nOne or two near Wraysford clapped him warmly on the back, and throughout\nthe class generally there was a show of satisfaction at this result, in\nstrange contrast with the manner in which the announcement of Oliver's\nsuccess had been received.\n\nStill, every one was too eager to hear the third and final announcement\nto disturb the proceedings by any demonstration just now.\n\n\"Loman, Sixth Form--\" and here the Doctor paused, and knitted his brows.\n\n\"Loman, Sixth Form, 70 marks!\"\n\nThis finally brought down the house.  Scarcely was the Doctor's back\nturned, when a general clamour rose on every hand.  He, good man, set it\ndown to applause of the winners, but every one else knew it meant\ntriumph over the vanquished.\n\n\"Bravo, Wray! old man.  Hurrah for the Fifth!\" shouted Bullinger.\n\n\"Ninety-seven to seventy.  Splendid, old fellow!\" cried another.\n\n\"I was certain you'd win,\" said another.\n\n\"I have not won,\" said Wraysford, drily, and evidently not liking these\nmarked congratulations; \"I'm second.\"\n\n\"So you are, I quite forgot,\" said Ricketts: then turning to Oliver, he\nadded, mockingly, \"Allow me to congratulate you, Greenfield, on your\nreally brilliant success. 112 marks out of 120!  You could hardly have\ndone better if you had seen the paper a day or two before the exam!\nYour class, I assure you, are very proud of you.\"\n\nA general sneer of contempt followed this speech, in the midst of which\nOliver, after darting one angry glance at the speaker, deliberately\nquitted the room.\n\nThis proceeding greatly irritated the Fifth, who had hoped at least to\nmake their class-fellow smart while they had the opportunity.  They\ngreeted his departure now with a general chorus of hissing, and revenged\nthemselves in his absence by making the most of Wraysford.\n\n\"Surely the fellow won't be allowed to take the scholarship after this?\"\nsaid Ricketts.  \"The Doctor must see through it all.\"\n\n\"It's very queer if he doesn't,\" said Bullinger.\n\n\"The scholarship belongs to Wray,\" said Braddy, \"and I mean to say it's\na blackguard shame if he doesn't get it!\"\n\n\"It's downright robbery, that's what it is!\" said another; \"the fellow\nought to be kicked out of the school!\"\n\n\"I vote some one tells the Doctor,\" said Braddy.\n\n\"Suppose you go and tell him now, yourself,\" said Pembury, with a\nsarcastic smile; \"you could do it capitally.  What do you say?\"\n\nBraddy coloured.  Pembury was always snubbing him.\n\n\"I don't want to tell tales,\" he said.  \"What I mean is, Wraysford ought\nnot to be cheated out of his scholarship.\"\n\n\"It's a lucky thing Wray has got you to set things right for him,\"\nsnarled Pembury, amid a general titter.\n\nBraddy subsided at this, and left his tormentor master of the situation.\n\n\"There's no use our saying or doing anything,\" said that worthy.  \"We\nshall probably only make things worse.  It's sure to come out in time,\nand till then we must grin and bear it.\"\n\n\"All very well,\" said some one, \"but Greenfield will be grinning too.\"\n\n\"I fancy not,\" said Pembury.  \"I'm not a particular angel myself, but\nI've a notion if I had cheated a schoolfellow I should be a trifle off\nmy grinning form; I don't know.\"\n\nThis modest confession caused some amusement, and helped a good deal to\nrestore the class to a better humour.\n\n\"After all, I don't envy the fellow his feelings this minute,\" continued\nPembury, following up his advantage.\n\n\"And I envy his prospects in the Fifth still less,\" said Ricketts.\n\n\"If you take my advice,\" said Pembury, \"you'll leave him pretty much to\nhimself.  Greenfield is a sort of fellow it's not easy to score off; and\nsome of you would only make fools of yourselves if you tried to do it.\"\n\nWraysford had stood by during this conversation, torn by conflicting\nemotions.  He was undoubtedly bitterly disappointed to have missed the\nscholarship; but that was as nothing to the knowledge that it was his\nfriend, his own familiar friend, who had turned against him and thus\ngrievously wronged him.  Yet with all his sense of injury he could\nhardly stand by and listen to all the bitter talk about Oliver in his\nabsence without a sense of shame.  Two days ago he would have flared up\nat the first word, and given the rash speaker something to remember.\nNow it was his misery to stand by and hear his old chum abused and\ndespised, and to feel that he deserved every word that was spoken of\nhim!\n\nIf he could only have found one word to say on his behalf!\n\nBut he could not, and so left the room as soon as it was possible to\nescape, and retired disconsolately to his own study.\n\nAs for the Fifth, Pembury's advice prevailed with them.  There were a\nfew who were still disposed to take their revenge on Oliver in a more\nmarked manner than by merely cutting him; but a dread of the tongue of\nthe editor of the _Dominican_, as well as a conviction of the\nuselessness of such procedure, constrained them to give way and fall in\nwith the general resolution.\n\nOne boy only was intractable.  That was Simon.  It was not in the poet's\nnature to agree to cut anybody.  When the class dispersed he took it\ninto his gifted head to march direct to Oliver's study.  Oliver was\nthere, writing a letter.\n\n\"Oh, I say, you know,\" began Simon, nervously, but smiling most affably,\n\"all the fellows are going to cut you, you know, Greenfield.  About that\npaper, you know, the time I met you coming out of the Doctor's study.\nBut _I_ won't cut you, you know.  We'll hush it all up, you know,\nGreenfield; upon my word we will.  But the fellows think--\"\n\n\"That will do!\" said Oliver, angrily.\n\n\"Oh, but you know, Greenfield--\"\n\n\"Look here, if you don't get out of my study,\" said Oliver, rising to\nhis feet, \"I'll--\"\n\nBefore he could finish his sentence the poet, who after all was one of\nthe best-intentioned jackasses in Saint Dominic's, had vanished.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25. LOMAN IN LUCK.\n\nWhile we have been talking of Oliver and Wraysford, and of the manner in\nwhich the results of the Nightingale examination affected them and the\nclass to which they belonged, the reader will hardly have forgotten that\nthere was another whose interest in that result was fully as serious and\nfully as painful.\n\nLoman had been counting on gaining the scholarship to a dead certainty.\nFrom the moment when it occurred to him he would be able to free himself\nof his money difficulties with Cripps by winning it, he had dismissed,\nor seemed to dismiss, all further anxiety from his mind.  He never\ndoubted that he in the Sixth could easily beat the two boys in the\nFifth; and though, as we have seen, he now and then felt a sneaking\nmisgiving on the subject, it never seriously disturbed his confidence.\n\nNow, however, he was utterly floored.  He did not need to wait for the\nannouncement of the results to be certain he had not won, for he had\nknown his fate the moment his eyes glanced down the questions on the\npaper on the morning of examination.\n\nAt his last interview with Cripps that memorable Saturday afternoon, he\nhad promised confidently to call at the Cockchafer next Thursday with\nthe news of the result, as a further guarantee for the payment of the\nthirty pounds, never doubting what that result would be.  How was he to\nface this interview now?\n\nHe could never tell Cripps straight out that he had been beaten in the\nexamination; that would be the same thing as telling him to go at once\nto the Doctor or his father with the document which the boy had signed,\nand expose the whole affair.  And it would be no use making a poor mouth\nto the landlord of the Cockchafer and begging to be forgiven the debt;\nLoman knew enough by this time to feel convinced of the folly of that.\nWhat was to be done?\n\n\"I shall have to humbug the fellow some way,\" said Loman to himself, as\nhe sat in his study the afternoon after the announcement of the result.\nAnd then followed an oath.\n\nLoman had been going from bad to worse the last month.  Ever since he\nhad begun, during the holidays, regularly to frequent the Cockchafer,\nand to discover that it was his interest to make himself agreeable to\nthe man he disliked and feared, the boy's vicious instincts had\ndeveloped strangely.  Company which before would have offended him, he\nnow found--especially when it flattered him--congenial, and words and\nacts from which in former days he would have shrunk now came naturally.\n\n\"I shall have to humbug the fellow somehow,\" said he; \"I only wish I\nknew how;\" and then Loman set himself deliberately to invent a lie for\nMr Cripps.\n\nA charming afternoon's occupation this for a boy of seventeen!\n\nHe sat and pondered for an hour or more, sometimes fancying he had hit\nupon the object of his search, and sometimes finding himself quite off\nthe tack.  Had Cripps only known what care and diligence was being\nbestowed on him that afternoon he would assuredly have been highly\nnattered.\n\nAt length he seemed to come to a satisfactory decision, and, naturally\nexhausted by such severe mental exertion, Loman quitted his study and\nsought in the playground the fresh air and diversion he so much needed.\nOne of the first boys he met there was Simon.  \"Hullo, Loman!\" said that\namiable genius, \"would you have believed it?\"\n\n\"Believed what?\" said Loman.\n\n\"Oh! you know, I thought you knew, about the Nightingale, you know.  I\nsay, how jolly low you came out!\"\n\n\"Look here! you'd better hold your row!\" said Loman, surlily, \"unless\nyou want a hiding.\"\n\n\"Oh; it's not that, you know.  What I meant was about Greenfield senior.\nIsn't that a go?\"\n\n\"What about him?  Why can't you talk like an ordinary person, and not\nlike a howling jackass?\"\n\n\"Why, you know,\" said Simon, off whom all such pretty side compliments\nas these were wont to roll like water off a duck's back--\"why, you know,\nabout that paper?\"\n\n\"What paper?\" said Loman, impatiently.  \"The one that was stolen out of\nthe Doctor's study, you know.  Isn't that a go?  But we're going to hush\nit up.  Honour bright!\"\n\nLoman's face at that moment was anything but encouraging.  Somehow, this\nroundabout way of the poet's seemed particularly aggravating to him, for\nhe turned quite pale with rage, and, seizing the unhappy bard by the\nthroat, said, with an oath, \"What do you mean, you miserable beast?\nWhat about the paper?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Simon, not at all put about by this rough handling--\"why,\ndon't you know? _we_ know who took it, we do; but we're all going to--\"\n\nBut at this point Simon's speech was interrupted, for the very good\nreason that Loman's grip on his throat became so very tight that the\nwretched poet nearly turned black in the face.\n\nWith another oath the Sixth Form boy exclaimed, \"Who took it?\"\n\n\"Why--don't you know?--oh!--oh, I say, mind my throat!--haven't you\nheard?--why, Greenfield senior, you know!\"\n\nLoman let go his man suddenly and stared at him.\n\n\"Greenfield senior?\" he exclaimed in amazement.\n\n\"Yes; would you have thought it?  None of us would--we're all going to\nhush it up, you know, honour bright we are.\"\n\n\"Who told you he took it?\"\n\n\"Why, you know, I saw him;\" and here Simon giggled jubilantly, to mark\nwhat astonishment his disclosure was causing.\n\n\"_You_ saw him take it?\" asked Loman, astounded.\n\n\"Yes; that is, I saw him coming out of the Doctor's study with it.\"\n\n\"You did?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is, of course he must have had it; and he says so himself.\"\n\n\"What, Greenfield says he took the paper?\" exclaimed Loman, in utter\nastonishment.\n\n\"Yes; that is, he doesn't say he didn't; and all the fellows are going\nto cut him dead, but we mean to hush it up if we can.\"\n\n\"Hush yourself up, that's what you'd better do,\" said Loman, turning his\nback unceremoniously on his informant, and proceeding, full of this\nstrange news, on his solitary walk.  What was in his mind as he went\nalong I cannot tell you.  I fancy it was hardly sorrow at the thought\nthat a schoolfellow could stoop to a mean, dishonest action, nor, I\nthink, was it indignation on Wraysford's or his own account.\n\nIndeed, the few boys who passed Loman that afternoon were struck with\nthe cheerfulness of his appearance.  Considering he had been miserably\nbeaten in the scholarship examination, this show of satisfaction was all\nthe more remarkable.\n\n\"The fellow seems quite proud of himself,\" said Callonby to Wren as they\npassed him.\n\n\"He's the only fellow who is, if that's so,\" said Wren.\n\nLoman stopped and spoke to them as they came up.\n\n\"Hullo! you fellows,\" said he, in as free and easy a manner as one\nfellow can assume to others who he knows dislike him, \"I wanted to see\nyou.  Which way are you going?--back to the school?\"\n\n\"Wren and I are going a stroll together,\" said Callonby, coldly;\n\"good-bye.\"\n\n\"Half a minute,\" said Loman.  \"I suppose you heard the results of the\nNightingale read out.\"\n\n\"Considering I was sitting on the same form with you when they were, I\nsuppose I did,\" said Wren.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Loman, evidently determined not to notice the\nsnubbing bestowed on him.  \"Mine wasn't a very loud score, was it?\nSeventy!  I was surprised it was as much!\"\n\nThe two Sixth boys looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"The fact is, I never tried to answer,\" said Loman, \"and for a very good\nreason.  I suppose you know.\"\n\n\"No--what?\" asked they.\n\n\"Haven't you heard?  I thought it was all over the school.  You heard\nabout the Doctor missing a paper?\"\n\n\"Yes; what about it?  Was it found, or lost, or what?\"\n\n\"No one owned to having taken it, that's certain.\"\n\n\"I should hope not.  Not the sort of thing any fellow here would do.\"\n\n\"That's just what I should have thought,\" said Loman.  \"But the fact is,\nsome one did take it--you can guess who--and you don't suppose I was\ngoing to be fool enough to take any trouble over my answers when I knew\none of the other fellows had had the paper in his pocket a day and a\nhalf before the exam.\"  And here Loman laughed.\n\n\"Do you mean to say Greenfield stole it?\" exclaimed both the friends at\nonce, in utter astonishment.\n\n\"I mean to say you're not far wrong.  But you'd better ask some of the\nFifth.  It's all come out, I hear, there.\"\n\n\"And you knew of it before the exam?\"\n\n\"I guessed it; or you may be sure I'd have taken a little more trouble\nover my answers.  It wasn't much use as it was.\"\n\nLoman had the satisfaction of seeing the two Sixth boys depart in\namazement, and the still greater satisfaction of seeing them a little\nlater in confidential conference with Simon, from whom he guessed pretty\ncorrectly they would be sure to get a full \"all-round\" narrative of the\nwhole affair.\n\n\"I'm all right with the Sixth, anyhow,\" muttered he to himself.  \"I only\nwish I was as right with that blackguard Cripps.\"\n\n\"That blackguard Cripps\" had, next afternoon, the peculiar pleasure of\nwelcoming his young friend and patron under the hospitable roof of the\nCockchafer.  As usual, he was as surprised as he was delighted at the\nhonour done him, and could not imagine for the life of him to what he\nwas indebted for so charming a condescension.  In other words, he left\nLoman to open the business as best he could.\n\n\"I promised to come and tell you about the exam, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Eh?  Oh, yes, to be sure.  That was last Saturday.  Upon my word, I'd\nquite forgotten.\"\n\nOf course Loman knew this was false; but he had to look pleasant and\nanswer, \"Well, you see, my memory was better than yours.\"\n\n\"Right you are, young captain.  And what about this here fifty-pound\ndicky-bird you've been after?\"\n\n\"The Nightingale?\" said Loman.  \"Oh, it's all right, of course; but the\nfact is, I forgot when I promised you the money now, that of course\nthey--\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, none of your gammon,\" said Mr Cripps, angrily; \"a\npromise is a promise, and I expect young swells as makes them to keep\nthem, mind that.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I'll keep them, Cripps.  What I was saying was that they\ndon't pay you the money till the beginning of each year.\"\n\nLoman omitted to mention, as he had omitted to mention all along, that\nyoung gentlemen who win scholarships do not, as a rule, have the money\nthey win put into their hands to do as they like with.  But this was a\ntrifling slip of the memory, of course!\n\n\"I don't care when they pay you your money!  All I know is I must have\nmine now, my young dandy.  Next week the time's up.\"\n\n\"But, Cripps, how _can_ I pay you unless I've got the money?\"\n\n\"No, no; I've had enough of that, young gentleman.  This time I'm\na-going to have my way, or the governor shall know all about it,--you\nsee!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't say that!\" said Loman.  \"Wait a little longer and it will be\nall right, it really will.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it.  That's what you said three months ago,\" replied\nCripps.\n\n\"I won't ask you again,\" pleaded the boy; \"just this time, Cripps.\"\n\n\"Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, that you ought,\" exclaimed\nthe virtuous landlord of the Cockchafer, \"a keeping a honest man out of\nhis money!\"\n\n\"Oh, but I'm certain to have it then--that is, next to certain.\"\n\n\"Oh! then what you're telling me about this here Nightingale of yours is\na lie, is it?\" said the 'cute Mr Cripps.  \"You ain't got it at all,\nain't you?\"\n\nLoman could have bitten his tongue off for making such a blunder.\n\n\"A lie?  No; that is--Why, Cripps, the fact is--\" he stammered, becoming\nsuddenly very red.\n\n\"Well, drive on,\" said Cripps, enjoying the boy's confusion, and proud\nof his own sharpness.\n\n\"The fact is--I was going to tell you, Cripps, I was really; there's\nbeen something wrong about this exam.  One of the fellows stole one of\nthe papers, and so got the scholarship unfairly.\"\n\n\"And I can make a pretty good guess,\" said Mr Cripps, with a grin,\n\"which of the fellows that gentleman was.\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't me, Cripps, really,\" said Loman, pale and quite humble in\nthe presence of his creditor; \"it was one of the others--Greenfield in\nthe Fifth; the fellow, you know, who struck you on Saturday.\"\n\n\"What, him?\" exclaimed Cripps, astonished for once in a way.  \"That\nbloke?  Why, he looked a honest sort of chap, he did, though I _do_ owe\nhim one.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Loman, following up this temporary advantage, \"he's a regular\nswindler, is Greenfield.  He stole the paper, you know, and so won the\nscholarship, of course.  I was certain of it, if it hadn't been for\nthat.  I mean to have a row made about it, and there's certain to be\nanother exam, so that I'm sure of the money if you'll only wait.\"\n\n\"And how long do you want me to wait, I'd like to know?\" said Cripps.\n\n\"Oh, till after Christmas, please, at any rate.  It'll be all right\nthen, I'll answer for that.\"\n\n\"You'll answer for a lot of things, it strikes me, young gentleman,\"\nsaid Cripps, \"before you've done.\"\n\nThere were signs of relenting in this speech which the boy was quick to\ntake advantage of.\n\n\"_Do_ wait till then!\" he said, beseechingly.\n\nCripps pretended to meditate.\n\n\"I don't see how I can.  I'm a poor man, got my rent to pay and all\nthat.  Look here, young gentleman, I must have 10 pounds down, if I'm to\nwait.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds!  I haven't as much in the world!\" exclaimed Loman.  \"I can\ngive you five pounds, though,\" he added.  \"I've just got a note from\nhome to-day.\"\n\n\"Five's no use,\" said Cripps, contemptuously, \"wouldn't pay not the\ninterest.  You'll have to make it a tenner, young gentleman.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Cripps, I'd gladly do it if I could; I'd pay you every\nfarthing, and so I will if you only wait.\"\n\n\"That's just the way with you young swells.  You get your own ways, and\nleave other people to get theirs best way they can.  Where's your\nfive-pound?\"\n\nLoman promptly produced this, and Cripps as promptly pocketed it,\nadding, \"Well, I suppose I'll have to give in.  How long do you say--two\nmonths?\"\n\n\"Three,\" said Loman.  \"Oh, thanks, Cripps, I really _will_ pay up then.\"\n\n\"You'd better, because, mind you, if you don't, I shall walk straight to\nthe governor.  Don't make any mistake about that.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, so you may,\" said the wretched Loman, willing to promise\nanything in his eagerness.\n\nFinally it was settled.  Cripps was to wait three months longer; and\nLoman, although knowing perfectly well that there was absolutely less\nchance then of having the money than there had been now, felt a weight\ntemporarily taken off his mind, and was all gratitude.\n\nOf course, he stayed a while as usual and tasted Mr Cripps's beer, and\nof course he met again not a few of his new friends--sharpers, most of\nthem, of Cripps's own stamp, or green young gentlemen of the town, like\nLoman himself.  From one of the latter Loman had the extraordinary \"good\nluck\" that afternoon to win three pounds over a wager, a sum which he at\nonce handed over to Cripps in the most virtuous way, in further\nliquidation of his debt.\n\nIndeed, as he left the place, and wandered slowly back to Saint\nDominic's, he felt quite encouraged.\n\n\"There's eight pounds of it paid right off,\" said he to himself; \"and\nbefore Christmas something is sure to turn up.  Besides, I'm sure to get\nsome more money from home between now and then.  Oh, it'll be all\nright!\"\n\nSo saying he tried to dismiss the matter from his mind and think of\npleasanter subjects, such, for instance, as Oliver's crime, and his own\nclever use of it to delude the Sixth.\n\nThings altogether were looking up with Loman.  Cheating, lying, and\ngambling looked as if they would pay after all!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26. AT COVENTRY.\n\nWere you ever at Coventry, reader?  I don't mean the quaint old\nWarwickshire city, but that other place where from morning till night\nyou are shunned and avoided by everybody?  Where friends with whom you\nwere once on the most intimate terms now pass you without a word, or\nlook another way as you go by?  Where, whichever way you go, you find\nyourself alone?  Where every one you speak to is deaf, every one you\nappear before is blind, every one you go near has business somewhere\nelse?  Where you will be left undisturbed in your study for a week, to\nfag for yourself, study by yourself, disport yourself with yourself?\nWhere in the playground you will be as solitary as if you were in the\ndesert, in school you will be a class by yourself, and even in church on\nSundays you will feel hopelessly out in the cold among your\nfellow-worshippers?\n\nIf you have ever been to such a place, you can imagine Oliver\nGreenfield's experiences during this Christmas term at Saint Dominic's.\n\nWhen the gentlemen of the Fifth Form had once made up their minds to\nanything, they generally carried it through with great heartiness, and\ncertainly they never succeeded better in any undertaking than in this of\n\"leaving Oliver to himself.\"\n\nThe only drawback to their success was that the proceeding appeared to\nhave little or no effect on the _very_ person on whose behalf it was\nundertaken.  Not that Oliver could be _quite_ insensible of the honours\npaid him.  He could not--they were too marked for that.  And without\ndoubt they were as unpleasant as they were unmistakable.  But, for any\nsign of unhappiness he displayed, the whole affair might have been a\nmatter of supreme indifference to him.  Indeed, it looked quite as much\nas if Greenfield had sent the Fifth to Coventry as the Fifth Greenfield.\nIf they determined none of them to speak to him, he was equally\ndetermined none of them should have the chance; and if it was part of\ntheir scheme to leave him as much as possible to himself, they had\nlittle trouble in doing it, for he, except when inevitable, never came\nnear them.\n\nOf course this was dreadfully irritating to the Fifth!  The moral\nrevenge they had promised themselves on the disgracer of their class\nnever seemed to come off.  The wind was taken out of their sails at\nevery turn.  The object of their aversion was certainly not reduced to\nhumility or penitence by their conduct; on the contrary, one or two of\nthem felt decidedly inclined to be ashamed of themselves and feel\nfoolish when they met their victim.\n\nOliver always had been a queer fellow, and he now came out in a queerer\nlight than ever.\n\nHaving once seen how the wind lay, and what he had to expect from the\nFifth, he altered the course of his life to suit the new circumstances\nwith the greatest coolness.  Instead of going up the river in a pair-oar\nor a four, he now went up in a sculling boat or a canoe, and seemed to\nenjoy himself quite as much.  Instead of doing his work with Wraysford\nevening after evening, he now did it undisturbed by himself, and, to\njudge by his progress in class, more successfully than ever.  Instead of\npractising with the fifteens at football, he went in for a regular\ncourse of practice in the gymnasium, and devoted himself with remarkable\nsuccess to the horizontal bar and the high jump.  Instead of casting in\nhis lot in class with a jovial though somewhat distracting set, he now\nkept his mind free for his studies, and earned the frequent commendation\nof the Doctor and Mr Jellicott.\n\nNow, reader, I ask you, if you had been one of the Fifth of Saint\nDominic's would not all this have been very riling?  Here was a fellow\nconvicted of a shameful piece of deceit, caught, one might say, in the\nvery act, and by his own conduct as good as admitting it.  Here was a\nfellow, I say, whom every sensible boy ought to avoid, not only showing\nhimself utterly indifferent to the aversion of his class-fellows, but\npositively thriving and triumphing before their very faces!  Was it any\nwonder if they felt very sore, and increasingly sore on the subject of\nOliver Greenfield?\n\nOne boy, of course, stuck to the exile through thick and thin.  If\nOliver had murdered all Saint Dominic's with slow poison, Stephen would\nhave stuck to him to the end, and he stuck to him now.  He, at least,\nnever once admitted that his brother was guilty.  When slowly he first\ndiscovered what were the suspicions of the Fifth, and what was the\ncommon talk of the school about Oliver, the small boy's indignation was\npast description.  He rushed to his brother.\n\n\"Do you hear the lies the fellows are telling about you, Noll?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Why don't you stop it, and tell them?\"\n\n\"What's the use?  I've told them once.  If they don't choose to believe\nit, they needn't.\"\n\nAny other boy would, of course, have taken this as clear evidence of the\nelder brother's guilt; but it only strengthened the small boy's\nindignation.\n\n\"_I'll_ let them know, if _you_ won't!\" and forthwith he went and\nproceeded to make himself a perfect nuisance in the school.  He began\nwith Wraysford.\n\n\"I say, Wray,\" he demanded, \"do you hear all the lies the fellows are\ntelling about Noll?\"\n\n\"Don't make a row now,\" said Wraysford, shortly.  \"I'm busy.\"  But\nStephen had no notion of being put down.\n\n\"The fellows say he stole an exam paper, the blackguards!  I'd like to\npunch all their heads, and I will too!\"\n\n\"Clear out of my study, now,\" said Wraysford, sharply.\n\nStephen stared at him a moment.  Then his face grew pale as he grasped\nthe meaning of it all.\n\n\"I say, Wray, surely _you_ don't believe it?\" he cried.\n\n\"Go away now,\" was Wraysford's only answer.\n\nBut this did not suit Stephen, his blood was up, and he meant to have it\nout.\n\n\"Surely _you_ don't believe it?\" he repeated, disregarding the\nimpatience of the other; \"_you_ aren't a blackguard, like the rest?\"\n\n\"Do you hear what I tell you?\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"No, and I don't mean to!\" retorted the irate Stephen.  \"If you were\nanything of a friend you'd stand up for Oliver.  You're a beast,\nWraysford, that's what you are!\" continued he, in a passion.  \"You're a\nblackguard! you're a liar!  I could kill you!\"\n\nAnd the poor boy, wild with rage and misery, actually flung himself\nblindly upon his brother's old friend--the saviour of his own life.\n\nWraysford was not angry.  There was more of pity in his face than anger\nas he took the small boy by the arm and led him to the door.  Stephen no\nlonger resisted.  After giving vent to the first flood of his anger,\nmisery got the upper hand of him, and he longed to go anywhere to hide\nit.  He could have endured to know that Oliver was suspected by a good\nmany of the fellows, but to find Wraysford among them was a cruel blow.\n\nBut in due time his indignation again came to the fore, and he ventured\non another crusade.  This time it was to Pembury.  He knew before he\nwent he had little enough to expect from the sharp-tongued editor of the\n_Dominican_, so he went hoping little.\n\nTo his surprise, however, Pembury was kinder than usual.  He told him\nplainly that he did suspect Oliver, and explained why, and advised\nStephen, if he were wise, to say as little about Oliver as possible at\npresent.  The young champion was quite cowed by this unexpected\nreception.  He did his best to fly in a rage and be defiant, but it was\nno use, and he retired woefully discomfited from the interview.\n\nOthers to whom he applied, when once again his anger got the better of\nhis wretchedness, met him with taunts, others with contempt, others with\npositive unkindness; and after a week Stephen gave it up and retired in\ndudgeon to the territory of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, determined\nthat there at least he would, at the edge of the knuckle, if needs be,\ncompel a faction to declare for his brother.\n\nIn this undertaking, I need hardly say, he was eminently successful.\nThere were those among the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles who were ready to\ndeclare for anybody or anything as long as there was a chance of a row\non the head of it.  Already the question of Greenfield senior had been\noccupying their magnificent minds.  When the story first fell suddenly\ninto their midst, it was so surprising that, like the frogs and the log\nin the fable, they were inclined to be a little shy of it.  But,\ngradually becoming accustomed to it, and looking carefully into it from\nall sides, it seemed somehow to contain the promise of a jolly row, and\ntheir hearts warmed to it proportionally.  No one quite liked to start\nthe thing at first, for fear doubtless of not doing it full justice, but\nit only wanted a spark to kindle the whole lower school on the question\nof Greenfield senior.  Stephen it was who supplied the spark.\n\nHe entered the Fourth Junior room one day, after one of the unsuccessful\ncrusades of which we have spoken, utterly cast down and out of humour.\nHe flung his cap on to the peg, and himself on to his seat, in an\nunusually agitated manner, and then, to the astonishment of everybody,\nbroke out into tears!\n\nThis was a rare and glorious opportunity, of course, for Bramble.\n\n\"Beastly young blub-baby!\" exclaimed that doughty hero, \"you're always\nblubbing!  I never knew such a fellow to blub, did you, Padger?\"\n\nPadger said it was worse than the baby at home, and the two thereupon\nstarted a mocking caterwaul on their own account, in which not a few of\ntheir nearest and dearest friends joined.\n\nThis performance had the effect of restoring Stephen's composure.\nHastily dashing away his tears, he flew with unwonted wrath at his\nenemy.  Bramble, however, managed to get behind Padger and the rest, and\nthus fortified shouted out, \"Yah, boo, howling young sucking pig! go\nhome to your mammy, or your great big cheat of a blackguard thief of a\ncaddish big brother!  Do you hear?  Who stole the exam paper?  Eh,\nPadger?  Yah, boo, pack of sneaking Guinea-pigs!\"\n\nThis last objurgation, which was quite unnecessary to the beauty or\nforce of the speech, gave rise to a huge tumult.\n\nThe Guinea-pigs present took it up as a direct challenge to themselves,\nand it decided them instantly to declare in favour of Stephen and his\nbig brother.  Paul led the attack.\n\n\"Shut up, you young cad, will you?\" said he; \"you know well enough _you_\nstole the paper.\"\n\nOf course no one, not even Paul himself, attached any meaning to such an\nabsurd accusation, but it came conveniently to hand.\n\nThis declaration of war was promptly taken up on all sides, and for a\nshort period the Fourth Junior had a rather dusty appearance.  When at\nlength a little order was restored, a lively discussion on the crime of\nGreenfield senior ensued.  The Tadpoles to a man believed in it, and\ngave it as their candid opinion that the fellow ought to be hung.  \"Yes,\nand expelled too!\" added a few of the more truculent.\n\nThe Guinea-pigs, on the other hand, whatever they thought, protested\nvehemently that Greenfield senior was the most virtuous, heroic,\nsaintly, and jolly fellow in all Saint Dominic's, and denounced the\nTadpoles and all the rest of the school as the most brutal ruffians in\nChristendom.\n\n\"They ought all to be expelled, every one of them,\" said one; \"all\nexcept Greenfield senior, and I hope they will be.\"\n\n\"All I know is,\" said Paul, \"I'll let them have a bit of my mind, some\nof them.\"\n\n\"So will I,\" said another.\n\n\"You haven't got any to give 'em a bit of,\" squealed Bramble, \"so now!\"\n\n\"All right, I'll give 'em a bit of _you_ then,\" retorted Paul.\n\n\"You wouldn't get any of them to touch him with a pair of tongs,\" added\nanother.\n\nThis was too much for Bramble, and another brief period of dust ensued.\nThen, comparative quiet once more prevailing, Paul said, \"I tell you\nwhat, _I_ mean to stick to Greenfield senior.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said another youth, with his face all over ink.  \"I mean _to\nfag_ for him.\"\n\n\"So do I!\" shouted another.\n\n\"So do I!\" shouted another.\n\nAnd a general chorus of assent hailed the idea.\n\n\"We'll all fag for him, I vote, eh, Stee?\" said Paul, \"the whole lot of\nus!  My eye, that'll be prime!  Won't the others just about look black\nand blue!\"\n\nIt was a magnificent idea!  And no sooner conceived than executed.\n\nThere was a great rush of Guinea-pigs to Oliver's study.  He was not\nthere.  So much the better.  They would give him a delightful surprise!\n\nSo they proceeded straightway to empty his cupboards and drawers, to\npolish up his cups, to unfold his clothes and fold them again, to take\ndown his books and put them up again, to upset his ink and mop it up\nwith one of his handkerchiefs, to make his tea and spill it on the\nfloor, to dirty his collars with their inky hands, to clean his boots\nwith his hat-brush, and many other thoughtful and friendly acts\ncalculated to make the heart of their hero glad.\n\nIn the midst of their orgies, Wraysford and Pembury passed the door, and\nstopped to look in, wondering what on earth the tumult was about.  But\nthey were greeted with such a storm of yells and hisses that they passed\non, a little uneasy in their minds as to whether or no hydrophobia had\nbroken out in Saint Dominic's.\n\nAfter them a detachment of Tadpoles, headed by Bramble appeared on the\nscene, for the purpose of mocking.  But, whatever their purpose may have\nbeen, it was abandoned for more active opposition when Paul presently\nemptied a tumblerful of lukewarm tea in the face of Master Bramble.\n\nA notable battle was fought on the threshold of Greenfield senior's\nstudy, in which many were wounded on both sides, and in the midst of\nwhich Oliver arrived on the scene, kicking right and left, and causing a\ngeneral rout.\n\nHow their hero appreciated the attentions his admirers had paid him\nduring his absence the Guinea-pigs did not remain or return to\nascertain.  They took for granted he was grateful, and bashfully kept\nout of the way of his thanks for a whole day.\n\nAfter that their enthusiasm returned, but this time it found a new vent.\nThey decided that, although they would all fag for him to the end of\nhis days, they would not for a season, at any rate, solicit jobs from\nhim, but rather encourage him by their sympathy and applause at a more\nrespectful distance.\n\nSo they took to cheering him in the playground, and following him down\nthe passages.  And this not being enough, they further relieved\nthemselves by hooting (at a respectful distance also) the chiefs of the\nsenior school, whose opinions on the question of Greenfield senior were\nknown not to agree with their own.\n\nIf Oliver was not grateful for all this moral support in his trouble, he\nmust have been a villain indeed of the deepest dye.  He never said in so\nmany words he was grateful; but then the Guinea-pigs remembered that\nfeelings are often too deep and too many for words, and so took for\ngranted the thanks which their consciences told them they deserved.\n\nMeanwhile a fresh number of the _Dominican_ was in progress, and rapidly\nnearing the hour of publication.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27. THE \"DOMINICAN\" ON THE SITUATION.\n\nThe examination at the beginning of the term had seriously interfered\nwith the prospects of the _Dominican_.  Pembury knew well enough it was\nno good trying to get anything out of the diligent section of his\nclass-fellows at such a time; and he knew equally well that a number\ncontributed entirely by the idlers of the Fifth would neither be\ncreditable to the paper nor appreciated by any one outside.\n\nSo like a prudent man he held back patiently till the examinations were\nover, and then pounced down on his men with redoubled importunity.\n\n\"Look here,\" said he one day to Ricketts, \"when are you going to let me\nhave that paper of yours?\"\n\n\"What paper do you mean?\" demanded Ricketts.\n\n\"Why for the _Dominican_, of course; you don't suppose I want one of\nyour cast-off exam papers, do you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't do anything for the _Dominican_ this time,\" said Ricketts.\n\n\"Yes, you can, and yes, you will,\" coolly replied Anthony.\n\n\"Who says I will?\" demanded Ricketts, inclined to be angry.\n\n\"It sounds as if _I_ do,\" replied the editor.  \"Why of course you'll do\nsomething for it, Rick?\"\n\n\"I'd be glad enough, but really I'm not in the humour,\" said Ricketts.\n\n\"Why ever not?\" demanded Tony.\n\n\"Why, the fact is,\" said Ricketts, \"I fancy the Fifth is not exactly\nlooking up at present, and we've nothing particular to be proud of.  If\nyou take my advice you'll keep the _Dominican_ quiet for a bit.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, that's the very thing we mustn't do.  Don't you see,\nyou old duffer you, that if we shut up shop and retire into private\nlife, everybody will be thinking we daren't hold up our heads?  I mean\nto hold up my head, for one,\" added Tony, proudly, \"if there were a\nthousand Greenfields in the class; and I mean to make you hold up yours\ntoo, old man.  It'll be time enough to do the hang-dog business when we\nall turn knaves; but till we do, we've as good a right to be known at\nSaint Dominic's as anybody else.  So none of your humbug, Rick.  We'll\nget out an extra good _Dominican_, and let the fellows see we're alive\nand kicking.\"\n\nThis speech had the required effect.  It not only won over Ricketts, but\nmost of the other leading spirits of the Fifth, who had been similarly\nholding back.\n\nTony was not the fellow to let an advantage go by.  Having once got his\nmen into a becoming frame of mind, he kept them well in hand and worked\nthem up into something like the old enthusiasm on the subject of the\n_Dominican_.\n\nEvery one was determined the present number should be an out-and-out\ngood one, and laboured and racked his brains accordingly.\n\nBut somehow or other the fellows had never found it so hard, first to\nget inspirations, and then to put them down on paper, as they did at\npresent.  Every one thought he had something very fine and very clever\nto say if he could only find expression for it.  The amount of\nbrain-cudgelling that went on over this _Dominican_ was simply awful.\nWraysford gave it up in disgust.  Ricketts, Bullinger, Tom Senior, and\nothers stumbled through their tasks, and could only turn out lame\nproductions at the best.  Even Pembury's lucubrations lacked a good deal\nof their wonted dash and spirit.  The cloud which was hanging over the\nFifth seemed to have overshadowed its genius for a while.\n\nStill Pembury kept his men at it and gave them no peace till their\nproductions, such as they were, were safe in his hands.  One boy only\nwas equal to the emergency; that I need hardly say was Simon.  He was\nindeed more eloquent than ever.  He offered Pembury a poem of forty\nverses, entitled, \"An Elegy on the Wick of a Candle that had just been\nblown out,\" to begin with, and volunteered to supplement this\ncontribution with one or two smaller pieces, such as, \"My Little Lark,\"\nor \"An Adventure outside the Dormitory Door,\" or \"Mind Mewsings.\"\n\nPembury prudently accepted all, and said he would insert what he thought\nfit, an assurance which delighted Simon, who immediately sat down and\nwrote some more \"pieces,\" in case at the last moment there might be room\nfor them too.  But, in spite even of these valuable contributions, the\n_Dominican_ fell flat.  There were a few good things in it here and\nthere, but it was far below its ordinary form; and not a few of the\nwriters repented sorely that ever they had put pen to paper to help\nproduce it.\n\nThe chief amusement of the paper was contained in a \"New Code of\nRegulations for the Better Management of Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles,\" from\nthe editor's pen.  It began thus:\n\n\"A society has lately been started at Saint Dominic's for the\npreservation and management of Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles.  The following\nare some of the rules to be observed:--\n\n\"Any one owning a Guinea-pig or Tadpole is to be responsible for washing\nit with soap and hot water at least twice a day.\n\n\"Any one owning a Guinea-pig or Tadpole is to supply the rest of the\nschool with cotton wool and scent.\n\n\"No Guinea-pig or Tadpole is on any account to use hair oil or grease\nwhich has not been sanctioned by a joint committee of the Fifth, Sixth,\nand masters.\n\n\"During the approaching winter, every one possessing a Guinea-pig or\nTadpole shall be at liberty, providing it is regularly washed, to use it\nas a warming-pan for his own bed.\"\n\nThe small tribe of furious juniors who as usual had crowded round the\npaper on the morning of publication to get \"first read,\" broke forth at\nthis point into a howl of exasperation.\n\n\"They won't!  I'll see they won't use me as a warming-pan, won't you,\nPadger?  The brutes!  I'll bite their horrid cold feet if they stick\nthem against me, that's what I'll do.\"\n\n\"I'll keep a pin to stick into them,\" said another.\n\n\"I'll get some leeches and put on their legs,\" shouted another.\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Stephen, changing the subject, \"it's cool\ncheek of them calling us `it,' as if we were things.\"\n\n\"So they have,\" exclaimed Paul; \"oh, I say, that's too much; I'll let\nthem know _I'm_ not a thing.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are a thing, isn't he, Padger?  A regular _it_,\" exclaimed the\nvindictive Bramble.  \"Yah, boo, old `_its_,' both of you.\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" said some one, just as the usual hostilities were about to\ncommence.  \"Listen to this.\"  And he read the next \"regulation\":--\n\n\"Immediate steps are to be taken to pickle a Tadpole as a specimen for\nthe school museum.  The following is a recipe for this.  Take the\nugliest, dirtiest, noisiest, and most ignorant specimen that can be\nfound.  Lift it carefully with a pair of tongs into a bath full of\nvinegar.  Close the lid and let it remain there to soak for a week.  At\nthe end of that time lift it out and scrape it well all over with a\nsharp substance, to get off the first coating of grime.  Soak again for\nanother week and scrape again, and so on till the ninth or tenth coating\nis removed.  After that the creature will appear thinner than when it\nbegan.  Hang it up to dry in a clean place, and be sure no other\nGuinea-pigs or Tadpoles come near it.  Then put it in a clean gown, and\nquickly, before it can get at the ink, put it in a large glass bottle\nand fasten down the stopper.  Label it, `Specimen of a curious reptile\nformerly found at Saint Dominic's.  Now happily extinct.'\"\n\n\"There you are,\" said Paul, when, after much blundering and sticking at\nwords, this remarkable paragraph had been read through.  \"There you are,\nBramble, my boy; what do you think of that?\"  Bramble had no difficulty\nin intimating what he thought of it in pretty strong language, and for\nsome little time the further reading of the _Dominican_ was suspended.\n\nWhen, however, the row was over, the group had been joined by several of\nthe elder boys, who appeared to appreciate Simon's poem, \"An Adventure\noutside the Dormitory Door.\"  It was called an \"epick,\" and began thus.\nThe reader must be contented with quite a short extract:--\n\n  \"Outside the Dormitory door\n  I walked me slow upon the floor\n  And just outside the Doctor's study\n  A youth I met all in a hurry;\n  His name perhaps I had better not tell\n  But like a snail retire into my shell.\"\n\nThis last simile had evidently particularly delighted the poet.  So much\nso, that he brought it in at the close of every succeeding verse.  The\n\"epick\" went on, of course, to unravel the threads of the \"adventure,\"\nand to intimate pretty plainly who \"the youth\" referred to was.  To any\none not interested in the poet or his epic the production was a dull\none, and the moral at the end was not quite clear even to the most\nintellectual.\n\n  \"Now I must say farewell; yet stay, methinks\n  How many many youths do sit on brinks.\n  Oh joy to feel the soft breeze sigh\n  And in the shady grove to wipe the eye,\n  It makes me feel a man I know full well,\n  But like a snail I'll now retire within my shell.\"\n\nThese were the only articles in the _Dominican_ that afforded any\namusement.  The remainder of the paper, made up of the usual articles\nsneering at the Sixth and crowing over the school generally, were very\ntame.  The result of the Nightingale Scholarship was announced as\nfollows:--\n\n  \"The examination for the Nightingale Scholarship was held on the 1st\n  October.  The scholarship was lost by Loman of the Sixth by 70 marks\n  to 97.  A good performance on the whole.\"\n\nThis manner of announcing the unfortunate result was ingenious, and did\nTony credit.  For, whether his object was to annoy the Sixth or to\nshield the Fifth, he succeeded amply in both.  There were some, however,\nin the Fifth who were by no means content that Greenfield should be let\noff so easily in the _Dominican_, and these read with interest the\nfollowing \"Notes from Coventry,\" contributed by Bullinger.  Anthony had\naccepted and inserted them against his better judgment.\n\n\"If the fellow is at Coventry, why not let him stay there?\" he said to\nBullinger.  \"The best thing we can possibly do is to let him alone.\"\n\n\"I don't see it,\" said Bullinger.  \"Everybody will think we are trying\nto shield him if we keep so quiet.  Anyhow, here's my paper.  You can\nput it in or not, which you like.  I'm not going to write anything\nelse.\"\n\nPembury took the paper and put it in.  The reader may like to hear a few\nof the \"Notes from Coventry.\"\n\n\"The quaint old city of Coventry has lately been visited by a\n`gentleman' from Saint Dominic's, who appears so charmed with all he has\nseen and heard that it is expected he will remain there for some\nconsiderable time.\n\n\"The object of his visit is of a private nature, possibly for the\npurpose of scientific research, for which absolute quiet is necessary.\nHis experiments are chiefly directed to the making or taking of\nexamination papers, and on his return we may look for valuable\ndiscoveries.  Meanwhile he sees very little company.  The society in\nwhich he most delights is that of certain Guinea-pigs, between whom and\nhimself a special bond of sympathy appears to exist.  It is a touching\nsight to see him taking his daily walks in company with these singular\nanimals; who, be it said, seem to be the only creatures able to\nappreciate his character.  Curiously enough, since he left us, Saint\nDominic's has not collapsed; indeed, it is a singular fact that now he\nis away it is no longer considered necessary for every fellow to lock\nhis study-door when he goes out, and keep the key.\"  And so on.\n\nMiserable stuff indeed, as Stephen thought, but quite stinging enough to\nwound him over and over again as he saw the sneers and heard the laughs\nwith which the reading of the extract was greeted.  Everybody evidently\nwas against his brother, and, with a deep disgust and fury at his heart,\nhe left them to laugh by themselves and returned to Oliver's study.\n\nHe found his brother in what were now his usual cheerful spirits.  For\nafter the first week or so of his being sent to Coventry, Oliver, in his\nown study at least, kept up a cheerful appearance.\n\n\"Hullo, Stee,\" said he as the young brother entered.  \"You're just in\ntime.  Here's a letter from mother.\"\n\n\"Is there?  How jolly!  Read it out, Noll.\"\n\nSo Oliver read it out.  It was an ordinary, kind, motherly epistle, such\nas thousands of schoolboys get every week of the school year.  All about\nhome, and what is going on, how the dogs are, where sister Mary has been\nto, how the boiler burst last week, which apple-tree bore most, and so\non; every scrap of news that could be scraped up from the four winds of\nheaven was in that letter.\n\nAnd to the two brothers, far away, and lonely even among their\nschoolfellows, it came like a breath of fresh air that morning.\n\n\"I have been so proud,\" went on Mrs Greenfield towards the end of the\nletter, \"ever since I heard of dear Oliver's success in winning the\nscholarship.  Not so much for the value of it, though that is pretty\nconsiderable, but because I am so sure he deserves it.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" put in Stephen.\n\n\"Poor Mr Wraysford!  I hope he is not very much disappointed.  How nice\nit would have been if there had been two scholarships, and each could\nhave had one!  I suppose the Fifth is making quite a hero of Oliver.  I\nknow one foolish old woman who would like to be with her boys this\nmoment to share their triumph.\"\n\nOliver laughed bitterly.\n\n\"That _would_ be a treat for her!\"\n\nStephen, very red in the face, was too furious for words, so Oliver went\non:\n\n\"And if, instead of triumph, they should ever be in trouble or sorrow,\nstill more would I love to be with them, to share it.  But most of all\ndo I trust and pray they may both make a constant friend of the Saviour,\nwho wants us all to cast our burdens on Him, and follow the example He\nhas left us in all things.\"\n\nThere was a silence for some moments after this home message fell on the\nbrothers' ears.  The hearts of both were full--too full for words--but I\nthink, had the widow-mother far away been able to divine the secret\nthoughts of her boys, hope would have mingled with all her pity and all\nher solicitude on their account.\n\nBut the old trouble, for the present at any rate, was destined to swamp\nall other emotions.\n\nOliver continued reading: \"Christmas will not be so very long now in\ncoming.  We must have a real snug, old-fashioned time of it here.  Uncle\nHenry has promised to come, and your cousins.  It would be nice if you\ncould persuade Mr Wraysford to come here then.  I am so anxious to see\nhim again.  Tell him from me I reckon on him to be one of our party if\nhe can possibly manage it.\"\n\n\"Baa!\" exclaimed Stephen.  \"The beast!  I'll let her know what sort of\nblackguard the fellow is!\"\n\n\"Easy all, young 'un,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"I shan't easy all, Noll!\" exclaimed the boy; \"he _is_ a blackguard, you\nknow he is, and I hate him.\"\n\n\"I think he's a fool just now,\" said Oliver, \"but--well, he fished you\nout of the Thames, Stee; you oughtn't to call him a blackguard.\"\n\n\"I wish he'd left me in the Thames,\" said Stephen, nearly breaking down.\n\"I've been miserable enough this term for half a dozen.\"\n\nOliver looked hard and long at his young brother.  It never seemed to\nhave occurred to him before how deeply the boy took the trouble of his\nelder brother to heart.\n\nNow if Oliver had really been innocent, the natural thing would have\nbeen--wouldn't it?--for him to be quite cut up at this exhibition of\nfeeling, and fall on his brother's neck and protest once more that he\nnever did or would or could do such a thing as that he was suspected of.\nBut instead of this, the hardened villain turned quite cross when he\nsaw his brother at the point of tears, and exclaimed, hurriedly, \"Don't\nmake a young fool of yourself, Stee, whatever you do.  It won't do a bit\nof good.\"\n\n\"But, Noll, old man,\" pleaded the boy, \"why ever don't you--\"\n\n\"Because I don't choose, and it would be no use if I did,\" retorted the\nother.\n\n\"But the fellows all suspect you!\"\n\n\"I can't help that, if they do.  Come now, Stee, we've had enough of\nthis.  It'll all come right some day, you see, and meanwhile what do you\nsay to a turn in the gymnasium?\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" persisted Stephen, not half satisfied, \"you surely aren't\ngoing to give mother's message to Wraysford?  _I_ don't want him home at\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"No one asked you if you did, you young duffer.  But I don't think, all\nthe same, I shall give it just yet.\"\n\nThey were walking down the big passage arm-in-arm in the direction of\nthe gymnasium, and as Oliver spoke these last words the subject of their\nconversation appeared advancing towards them.\n\nWho could have believed that those three friends who only a month or two\nago were quoted all over Saint Dominic's as inseparables could ever meet\nand pass one another as these three met and passed one another now?\n\nWraysford coloured as he caught sight of his old ally, and looked\nanother way.  Oliver, more composed, kept his eyes fixed straight ahead,\nand appeared to be completely unconscious of the presence of any one but\nStephen, who hung on to his arm, snorting and fuming and inwardly raging\nlike a young tiger held in by the chain from his prey.\n\nAn odd meeting indeed, and a miserable one; yet to none of the three so\nmiserable as to the injured Wraysford, who ever since the day of the\nNightingale examination had not known a happy hour at Saint Dominic's.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28. MR CRIPPS AT SAINT DOMINIC'S.\n\nOliver Greenfield's banishment from civilised society, however much it\nmay have gratified the virtuous young gentlemen of the Fifth, was\nregarded by a small section of fellows in the Sixth with unmitigated\ndisgust.  These fellows were the leading spirits of the Saint Dominic\nFootball Club, which was just about to open proceedings for the season.\nTo them the loss of the best half-back in the school was a desperate\ncalamity.\n\nThey raged and raved over the matter with all the fury of disappointed\nenthusiasts.  _They_ didn't care a bit, it almost seemed, whether the\nfellow was a cheat or not.  All they knew was, he was the quickest\nhalf-back and the safest drop-kick the school had, and here was the\nmatch with Landfield coming on, and, lo and behold! their man was in\nCoventry, forsooth, and not to be had out for love or money.  Thus\nbaulked, the Sixth Form athletes could afford to wax very virtuous and\nphilanthropic on the subject of Coventry generally.\n\n\"The Doctor ought to put a stop to it,\" said Stansfield, who this year\noccupied the proud position of captain of the fifteen.\n\n\"Why, we've not got a single man worth twopence behind the scrimmage!\"\n\nThis was gratifying for Loman, one of the council of war, who usually\nplayed quarter or half-back in the matches.\n\n\"I don't see why we shouldn't get him to play if he _is_ at Coventry,\"\nsaid Callonby; \"_we_ didn't send him there.\"\n\n\"All very well,\" said the captain; \"if we got him we should lose\nRicketts, and Bullinger, and Tom Senior, and Braddy, which would come to\nabout the same thing.\"\n\n\"And I shouldn't play either,\" said Loman, \"if Greenfield played.\"\n\nStansfield shrugged his shoulders and looked vicious.\n\n\"All child's play!\" said he.  \"They think it's very grand and a fine\nspectacle and all that.  But they ought to have more consideration for\nthe credit of the school.\"\n\n\"It's not much to the credit of the school,\" said Loman, \"to have a\nfellow like him in the fifteen.\"\n\n\"It's less credit to have a pack of louts who tumble head over heels\nevery time they try to pick up a ball, and funk a charge twice out of\nevery thrice!\" retorted Stansfield, who was one of the peppery order.\n\"Greenfield's worth any half-dozen of you, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Better get him to play Landfield by himself,\" growled Loman, who\ngenerally got the worst of it in discussions like this.\n\n\"It's a plaguey nuisance, that's what it is,\" said Stansfield; \"we are\nsure to get licked.  Who's to play half-back instead of him, I'd like to\nknow?\"\n\n\"Forrester, in the Fourth, plays a very good half-back,\" said Callonby;\n\"he's tremendously quick on his feet.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he can't kick.  I've a good mind to put Wraysford in the\nplace.  And yet he's such a rattling steady `back' I don't like to move\nhim.\"\n\n\"Wraysford told me yesterday,\" said Wren, \"he wasn't going to play.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Stansfield, starting up as if he had been shot.\n\"Wraysford not going to play!\"\n\n\"So he said,\" replied Wren.\n\n\"Oh, this is a drop too much!  Why ever not?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  He's been awfully down in the mouth lately; whether it\nis about the Nightingale, or--\"\n\nThe captain gave a howl of rage.\n\n\"I wish that miserable brute of a Nightingale had been scragged, that I\ndo!  Everything's stopped for the Nightingale!  Who cares a button about\nthe thing, I'd like to know?  Wraysford can get dozens more of them\nafter the football season's over.  Why, the Doctor gave out another\nscholarship to be gone in for directly after Christmas, only to-day.\nCan't he go in for that?\"\n\n\"So he will, I expect,\" said Wren; \"but I don't fancy he'll play, all\nthe same, on Saturday.\"\n\nStansfield groaned.  \"There go my two best men,\" he said; \"we may as\nwell shut up shop and go in for croquet.\"\n\nA powerful deputation waited on Wraysford that same evening to try to\nprevail upon him to play in the fifteen.  They had hard work to do it.\nHe said he was out of form, and didn't feel in the humour, and was\ncertain they could get on well enough without him.\n\n\"Oh, no, we can't,\" said Stansfield.  \"I say, Wraysford,\" he added,\nbluntly, \"I expect it's this Nightingale affair's at the bottom of all\nthis nonsense.  Can't you possibly patch it up, at any rate till after\nSaturday?  I'd give my head to get you and Greenfield in the team.\"\n\n\"Do play, Wraysford,\" put in Callonby.  \"Don't let the school be beaten\njust because you've got a row on with another fellow.\"\n\n\"It's not that at all,\" said Wraysford, feeling and looking very\nuncomfortable.  \"It's nothing to do with that.  It's just that I'm not\nin the humour.  I'd really rather not.\"\n\n\"Oh, look here,\" cried Stansfield; \"that won't wash.  Come to oblige me,\nthere's a good fellow.\"\n\nIn the end Wraysford gave in, and the captain went off half consoled to\ncomplete his preparations, and inveigh in his odd moments against all\nNightingales and Coventrys, and examinations, and all such enemies and\nstumbling-blocks to the glorious old English sport of football.\n\nLoman looked forward to the coming match with quite good spirits.\nIndeed, it was a long time since he had felt or appeared so\nlight-hearted.\n\nThat very day he had received a most unexpected present in the shape of\na five-pound note from an aunt, which sum he had promptly and virtuously\nput into an envelope and sent down to Mr Cripps in further liquidation\nof his \"little bill.\"  Was ever such luck?  And next week the usual\nremittance from home would be due; there would be another three or four\npounds paid off.  Loman felt quite touched at the thought of his own\nhonesty and solvency.  If only everybody in the world paid their debts\nas he did, what a happy state of things it would be for the country!\n\nSo, as I said, Loman looked forward to the football match in quite good\nspirits, just as a man who has been working hard and anxiously for\neleven long months looks forward to his well-earned summer holiday.\nThings were looking up with him, and no mistake.\n\nAnd then, just like his luck, the Doctor had that same day made the\nannouncement, already referred to, of another scholarship to be competed\nfor directly after Christmas.  It was for Sixth form boys under\nseventeen, and he meant to go in for it!  True, this scholarship was\nonly for twenty pounds for a single year, but that was something.  As\nfar as he could see, Wraysford, who would get his move up at Christmas,\nwould be the only man in against him, if he did go in, and he fancied he\ncould beat Wraysford.  For in the Nightingale exam he had not really\ntried his best, but this time he would and astonish everybody.\nGreenfield would scarcely go in for this exam, even if he got his move\nup; it was safe to conclude his recent exploit would suffice him in the\nway of exams, for some time to come.\n\nAnd then, what could be more opportune than its coming off just after\nChristmas, at the precise time when Cripps would be looking for a final\nsettlement of his account, or whatever little of it remained still to\npay!  Oh, dear! oh, dear!  What a thing it is to be straight and honest!\nEverything prospers with a man when he goes in for being honest!  Why,\nLoman was positively being bathed in luck at the present time!\n\nThe Saturday came at last.  Stansfield had drilled his men as well as he\ncould during the interval, and devoutly hoped that he had got a\nrespectable team to cope with the Landfield fellows.  If he could only\nhave been sure of his half-back he would have been quite happy; and\nnever a practice passed without his growling louder than ever at the\ndisgraceful custom of sending useful behind-scrimmage men to Coventry.\nAt the last moment he decided to give the responsible post to Loman,\nrather than move forward Wraysford from his position at \"back\"; and\nLoman's usual place at quarter-back was filled up by young Forrester of\nthe Fourth, greatly to that young gentleman's trepidation and to the\nexultation of the Fourth Senior as a body, who felt terrifically puffed\nup to have one of their men actually in the first fifteen.\n\nSome of my readers may perhaps know from actual experience what are the\nnumerous and serious anxieties which always beset the captain of the\nfootball fifteen.  If the fellow is worth his salt he knows to a nicety\nwhere he is strong and where he is weak; he knows, if the wind blows one\nway, which is the best quarter-back to put on the left and which on the\nright.  He knows which of his \"bulldogs\" he can safely put into the\nmiddle of the scrimmage, and which are most useful in the second tier.\nHe knows when to call \"Kick!\" to a man and when to call \"Run!\" and no\nman knows better when to throw the ball far out from touch, or when to\nnurse it along close to the line.  It is all very well for outsiders to\ntalk of football everlastingly as a _game_.  My dear, good people,\nfootball is a science if ever there was a science; the more you know of\nit the more you will find that out.\n\nThis piece of lecturing is thrown in here for the purpose of observing\nthat Stansfield was a model football captain.  However worried and\nworrying and crabby he was in his ordinary clothes, in his football togs\nand on the field of battle he was the coolest, quickest, readiest, and\ncunningest general you could desire.  He said no more than he could\nhelp, and never scolded his men while play was going on, and, best of\nall, worked like a horse himself in the thick of the fight, and looked\nto every one else to do the same.\n\nYet on this Saturday all the captain's prowess and generalship could not\nwin the match for Saint Dominic's against Landfield.\n\nThe match began evenly, and for the first half of the time the game was\none long succession of scrimmages in the middle of the ground, from\nwhich the ball hardly ever escaped, and when it did, escaped only to be\ndriven back next moment into the \"mush.\"\n\n\"It'll do at this rate!\" thinks Stansfield to himself.  \"As long as they\nkeep it among the forwards we shan't hurt.\"\n\nAlas! one might almost have declared some tell-tale evil spirit had\nheard the boast and carried it to the ear of the enemy, for next moment\nhalf-time was called, the sides changed over, and with them the\nLandfielders completely reversed their tactics.\n\nThe game was no longer locked up in a scrimmage in the middle of the\nground.  It became looser all along the line; the ball began to slip\nthrough the struggling feet into the hands of those behind, who sent it\nshooting over the heads of the forwards into more open ground.  The\nquarter-backs and half-backs on either side ran and got round the\nscrimmages; and when at last they were collared, took to ending up with\nan expiring drop-kick, which sent the ball far in the direction of the\ncoveted goals.\n\nNothing could have happened worse for Saint Dominic's, for the strain\nfell upon them just at their weakest point.  Stansfield groaned as he\nsaw chance after chance missed behind his scrimmages.  Young Forrester\nplayed pluckily and hard at quarter-back, and shirked nothing; but he\ncould not kick, and his short runs were consequently of little use.\nCallonby, of course, did good work, but Loman, the half-back, was\nwoefully unsteady.\n\n\"What a jackass I was to put the fellow there!\" said Stansfield to\nhimself.\n\nAnd yet Loman, as a rule, was a good player, with plenty of dash and not\na little courage.  It was odd that to-day he should be showing such\nspecially bad form.\n\nThere goes the ball again, clean over the forwards' heads, straight for\nhim!  He is going to catch it and run!  No; he is not!  He is going to\ntake a flying kick!  No, he is not; he is going to make his mark!  No,\nhe is not; he is going to dribble it through!  Now if there is one thing\nfatal to football it is indecision.  If you wobble about, so to speak,\nbetween half a dozen opinions, you may just as well sit down on the\nground where you are and let the ball go to Jericho.  Loman gets\nflurried completely, and ends by giving the ball a miserable side-kick\ninto touch--to the extreme horror of everybody and the unmitigated\ndisgust of the peppery Stansfield.\n\nYet had the captain and his men known the cause of all this--had they\nbeen aware that that flash, half-tipsy cad of a fellow who, with half a\ndozen of his \"pals,\" was watching the match with a critical air, there\nat the ropes was the landlord of the Cockchafer himself, the holder of\nLoman's \"little bill\" for 30 pounds, they would perhaps have understood\nand forgiven their comrade's clumsiness.  But they did not.\n\nWhatever had brought Cripps there?  A thousand possibilities flashed\nthrough Loman's mind as he caught sight of his unwelcome acquaintance in\nthe middle of the match.  Was he come to make a row about his money\nbefore all the school? or had anything fresh turned up, or what?  And\nwhy on earth did he bring those other cads with him, all of whom Loman\nrecognised as pot-house celebrities of his own acquaintance?  No wonder\nif the boy lost his head and became flurried!\n\nHe felt miserable every time the ball flew over to Cripps's side of the\nground.  There was a possibility the landlord of the Cockchafer had only\ncome up out of curiosity, and, if so, might not have recognised his\nyoung friend among the players.  But this delusion was soon dispelled.\n\nThe ball went again into touch--this time close to the spot occupied by\nthe unwelcome group, and was about to be thrown out.\n\nStansfield signalled to Loman.  \"Go up nearer the line: close up.\"\n\nLoman obeyed, and as he did so there fell on his ears, in familiar\ntones, the noisy greeting, \"What cheer, Nightingale?  What cheer, my\nhearty?  Stick to your man; eh, let him have it, Mr Loman!  Two to one\nin half-sovereigns on Mr Loman.\"\n\nA laugh greeted this encouraging appeal, in the midst of which Loman,\nknowing full well every one had heard every word, became completely\ndisconcerted, and let the ball go through his fingers as if it had been\nquicksilver.\n\nThis was too much for Stansfield's patience.\n\n\"Go up forward, for goodness' sake,\" he exclaimed, \"if you must play the\nfool!  I'll go half-back myself.\"\n\nLoman obeyed like a lamb, only too glad to lose himself in the\nscrimmages and escape observation.\n\nThe match went on--worse and worse for Saint Dominic's.  Despite\nStansfield's gallant efforts at half-back (where he had never played\nbefore), despite Wraysford's steady play in goal, the ball worked up\nnearer and nearer the Dominican lines.\n\nThe Landfield men were quick enough to see the weak point of their\nenemies, and make use of the discovery.  They played fast and loose,\ngiving the ball not a moment's peace, and above all avoiding scrimmages.\nThe Saint Dominic's forwards were thus made practically useless, and\nthe brunt of the encounter fell on the four or five players behind, and\nthey were not equal to it.\n\nThe calamity comes at last.  One of the Landfield men gets hold of the\nball, and runs down hard along the touch-line.  Forrester is the\nquarter-back that side, and gallant as the Fourth Form boy is, his big\nopponent runs over him as a mastiff runs over a terrier.\n\nStansfield, anticipating this, is ready himself at half-back, and it\nwill go hard with him indeed if he does not collar his man.  Alas! just\nas the Landfielder comes to close quarters, and the Saint Dominic's\ncaptain grips him round the waist, the ball flies neatly back into the\nhands of another of the enemy, who, amid the shouts of his own men and\nthe crowd, makes off with it like fury, with a clear field before him,\nand only Wraysford between him and the Dominican goal.\n\n\"Look-out behind there!\"\n\nNo need of such a caution to a \"back\" like Wraysford.  He is looking\nout, and has been looking out ever since the match began.\n\nBut if he had the eyes of an Argus, and the legs of an Atlas, he could\nnot prevent that goal.  For the Landfield man has no notion of coming to\nclose quarters; he is their crack drop-kick, and would be an ass indeed\nif he did not employ his talent with such a chance as this.  He only\nruns a short way.  Then he slackens pace.  Wraysford rushes forward in\nfront, the pursuing host rush on behind, but every one sees how it will\nbe.  The fellow takes a deliberate drop-kick at the goal, and up flies\nthe ball as true as a rocket, clean over the posts, as certain a goal as\nSaint Dominic's ever lost!  It was no use crying over spilt milk, and\nfor the rest of the game Stansfield relaxed no efforts to stay the tide\nof defeat.  And he succeeded too, for though the ball remained\ndangerously near the school goal, and once or twice slipped behind, the\nenemy were unable to make any addition to their score before \"Time\" was\ncalled.\n\nWhen the match was over, Loman tried his best to slip away unobserved by\nhis respectable town acquaintances; but they were far too polite to\nallow him.\n\n\"Well,\" cried Mr Cripps, coolly joining the boy as he walked with the\nother players back to the school--\"well, you _do_ do it, you do.  Bless\nme!  I call that proper sport, I do.  What do you put on the game, bobs\nor sovereigns, eh?  Never mind, I and my pals we wanted a dander, so we\nthought we'd look you up, eh?  You know Tommy Granger here?  I heard him\nsaying as we came along he wondered what you'd stand to drink after it\nall.\"\n\nAll Loman could do was to stand still as soon as this talk began, and\ntrust his schoolfellows would walk on, and so miss all Mr Cripps's\ndisgusting familiarities.\n\n\"I say,\" whispered he, in an agitated voice, \"for goodness' sake go\naway, Cripps!  I shall get into an awful row if you don't.\"\n\n\"Oh, all serene, my young bantam,\" replied Cripps, aloud, and still in\nthe hearing of not a few of the boys.  \"I'll go if you want it so\nparticular as all that.  _I_ can tear myself away.  Only mind you come\nand give us a look up soon, young gentleman, for I and my pals ain't\nseen you for a good while now, and was afraid something was up.  Ta! ta!\nGood-day, young gentlemen all.  By-bye, my young Nightingales.\"\n\nLoman's feelings can be more easily imagined than expressed when Cripps,\nsaying these words, held out his hand familiarly to be shaken.  The boy\ndid shake it, as one would shake hands with a wolf, and then, utterly\nashamed and disgraced, he made his way among his wondering schoolfellows\nup to the school.\n\nWas this his luck, after all?  A monitor known to be the companion and\nfamiliar friend of the disreputable cad at the Cockchafer!  The boy who,\nif not liked, had yet passed among most of his schoolfellows as a\nsteady, well-conducted fellow, now suddenly shown up before the whole\nschool like this!\n\nLoman went his way to his study, feeling that the mask was pretty nearly\noff his face at last, and that Saint Dominic's knew him almost as he\nreally was.  Yet did they know all?\n\nAs Loman passed Greenfield's study he stopped and peeped in at the door.\nThe owner was sitting in his armchair, with his feet upon the\nmantelpiece, laughing over a volume of _Pickwick_ till the tears came.\nAnd yet the crime Oliver was suspected of was theft and lying?  Was it\nnot strange--must it not have struck Loman as strange, in all his\nmisery, that any one under such a cloud as Greenfield could think of\nlaughing, while _he_, under a cloud surely no greater, felt the most\nmiserable boy alive!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29. A QUEER PRIZE-DAY.\n\nThe long Christmas term crawled slowly on unsatisfactorily to everybody.\nIt was unsatisfactory to Loman, who, after the football match,\ndiscovered that what little popularity or influence he ever had was\nfinally gone.  It was unsatisfactory to Wraysford, who, not knowing\nwhether to be ashamed of himself or wroth with his old friend, settled\ndown to be miserable for the rest of the term.  It was unsatisfactory to\nthe Fifth, who felt the luck was against them, and that the cloud\noverhead seemed to have stuck there for good.  It was unsatisfactory to\nStephen, who raged and fretted twenty times a day on his brother's\nbehalf, and got no nearer putting him right than when he began.  And\nundoubtedly it must have been unsatisfactory to Oliver, a banished man,\nforgetting almost the use of tongue and ears, and, except his brother,\nnot being able to reckon on a single friend at Saint Dominic's outside\nthe glorious community of the Guinea-pigs.\n\nIn fact, the only section in the school to whom the term was\nsatisfactory, was these last-named young gentlemen and their sworn foes,\nthe Tadpoles.\n\nNow, at last, they had a clear issue before them--Greenfield senior, was\nhe a hero or was he a blackguard?  There was no mistaking sides there.\nThere was no unpleasant possibility of having to make common cause and\nproclaim an armistice.  No! on the question of Greenfield senior,\nGuinea-pigs and Tadpoles had something to fight about from morning till\nnight, and therefore _they_, at any rate, were happy!\n\n\"Jellicott,\" said Dr Senior one day, as the masters met for five\nminutes' talk in the head master's study, \"Greenfield in the Fifth is\nnot well, I'm afraid.  I never see him out in the playground.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Mr Jellicott.  \"I'm so rarely out there that I haven't\nnoticed.  I believe, however, he is quite well.\"\n\n\"I hope he is not overworking,\" said the Doctor.  \"He has done so very\nwell this term that it would be a pity if he spoiled his chance by\nknocking himself up.\"\n\n\"Greenfield senior,\" put in Mr Rastle, \"appears to be unpopular just at\npresent; at least, so I gather from what I have heard.  I don't know\nwhat crime he has committed, but the tribunal of his class have been\nvery severe on him, I fancy.\"\n\nThe Doctor laughed.\n\n\"Boys will be boys!  Well, it's a relief if that's the solution of the\nmystery, for I was afraid he was ill.  We have no right to interfere\nwith these boyish freaks, as long as they are not mischievous.  But you\nmight keep your eye on the little comedy, Jellicott.  It would be a pity\nfor it to go too far.\"\n\nMr Jellicott did keep his eye on the little comedy, and came to the\nconclusion that, whatever Greenfield had done, he was being pretty\nseverely paid out.  He reported as much to the Doctor, who, however,\nstill deprecated interference.\n\n\"We might only make things worse,\" said he, \"by meddling.  Things like\nthis always right themselves far better than an outsider can right them.\nBesides, as Greenfield will get his move up after Christmas, he will be\nless dependent on the good graces of his present class-fellows.\"\n\nAnd so the matter ended for the present, as far as the masters were\nconcerned.  The reader will, perhaps, feel very indignant, and declare\nthe Doctor was neglecting his duty in treating so serious a matter so\nlightly.  He ought (some one says) to have investigated the whole affair\nfrom beginning to end, and made sure what was the reason of the Fifth's\ndispleasure and of Oliver's disgrace.  In fact, when one comes to think\nof it, it is a marvel how the Doctor had not long ago guessed who took\nthe lost examination paper, and treated the criminal accordingly.\n\nChristmas prize-day was always a great event at Saint Dominic's.  For,\nas all the examinations had been held at the beginning of the term, all\nthe rewards were naturally distributed at the end of it.\n\nFellows who were leaving made on these occasions their last appearance\nbefore their old companions.  Fellows who had earned their removes\nfigured now for the last time as members of their old classes; and\nfellows who had distinguished themselves during the last year generally\nwere patted on the back by the masters and cheered by their\nschoolfellows, and made much of by their sisters, and cousins, and\naunts.\n\nFor ladies turned up at the Christmas prize-day at Saint Dominic's;\nladies, and big brothers, and old boys, and the school governors, with\nthe noble Earl at their head to give away the prizes.  It was a great\noccasion.  The school was decorated with flags and evergreens; Sunday\ntogs were the order of the day; the Doctor wore his scarlet hood, and\nthe masters their best gowns.  The lecture-theatre was quite gay with\nred-baize carpet and unwonted cushions, and the pyramid of\ngorgeously-bound books awaiting the hour of distribution on the centre\ntable.\n\nPrize-day, too, was the object of all sorts of preparations long before\nthe eventful date came round.  Ten days at least before it arrived the\nGuinea-pigs and Tadpoles were wont secretly to buy pumice-stone for\ntheir finger ends, and used one by one to disappear casually into Maltby\nand come back with their hair cut.  Then the Fourth Senior, who were for\never getting up testimonials to their master (they gave him a\ntestimonial on an average twice every term), were very busy collecting\ncontributions and discussing whether Mr Brand would prefer an ormolu\nmustard-pot, or a steel watch-chain, or an antimacassar.  The musical\nset at the school, too, were busy rehearsing part songs for the\nevening's festivities, and the dramatic set were terribly immersed for a\nfortnight beforehand in the preparations for a grand charade.\n\nAltogether the end of the Christmas term at Saint Dominic's was a busy\ntime, and the present year was certainly no exception to the rule.\nGreatly to the relief of Stephen and Oliver, Mrs Greenfield found\nherself unable at the last moment to come down and take part in the\nproceedings of the eventful day.  As long as the boys had expected her\nto come they had looked forward to prize-day with something like horror,\nbut now that that danger was passed, Oliver recovered his old unconcern,\nand Stephen relapsed once more into his attitude of terror-in-chief to\nhis big brother, snapping and snarling at any one who dared so much as\nto mention the name of Greenfield senior in his hearing.\n\nWell, the day came at last, fully as grand an occasion as any one\nexpected.  The noble Earl turned up half an hour early, and spent the\ninterval in patting the greasy heads of all the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles\nhe came across.  The mothers and sisters swarmed up and down the\nstaircases and in and out the studies, escorted proudly by their dear\nJohnnys and precious Bobs.  The red robes of the Doctor flashed down the\ncorridor, and in the lecture-theatre there was such a rustling of silk\ngowns and waving of feather bonnets, and gleaming of white collars and\nsparkling patent-leather boots, as must have fairly astonished that\nsombre place.  Every one was there--every fellow nearly had got a mother\nor somebody to show off to.  Even Bramble turned up with a magnificent\ngrandmother, greatly to the envy of friend and foe, and would have been\nthe proudest Tadpole alive if the dear good old lady had not insisted on\ntaking her descendant's _hand_ instead of his arm, and trotting him\nabout instead of letting him trot her.  Oliver and Stephen alone had no\nkith and kin to see them on this proud day.\n\nIn due time the lecture-theatre filled up, crowded from floor to\nceiling.  The noble Earl walked in amid terrific cheers and took his\nseat.  The Doctor walked in after him, amid cheers almost as terrific,\nand after him the ordinary procession of governors, masters, and\nexaminers; and when they were all seated prize-day had begun.\n\nFor up steps Mr Raleigh, the captain of the school, on to the raised\ndais, whence, after bowing profoundly to the noble Earl and everybody,\nhe delivers a neat speech in honour of a good old soul who lived three\nor four centuries ago, and left behind him the parcel of ground on which\nSaint Dominic's now stands, and a hatful of money besides, to found the\nschool.  Raleigh having said his say (and how proud the smallest boys\nare of the captain's whiskers as they listen!), up steps Wren and\ncommences a similar harangue in Greek.  The small boys, of course, cheer\nthis even more than the English.  Then up gets Mr Winter and spins off\na Latin speech, but this does not go down so well, for the juniors know\na _little_ Latin, and so are a good deal more critical over that than\nover the Greek.  The French and German speeches however, restore them to\ngood humour, and then the speeches are done.\n\nThen comes the noble Earl.  He is an old, old man, and his voice is weak\nand wavering, and scarcely any one hears a word he says.  Yet how they\ncheer him, those youngsters!  They watch the back of his head, and when\nit bobs then they know the end of a sentence has come, and they let out\naccordingly.\n\n\"My dearie,\" says Bramble's grandmother, \"don't stamp so.  The poor old\ngentleman can't hear his own voice.\"\n\n\"That's no matter,\" says \"my dearie,\" pounding away with his feet.  \"If\nwe keep it up the old boy may give us an extra week's holiday.\"\n\nThe old lady subsided at this, in a resigned way; and certainly when the\ngood old nobleman did reach his final bob, his merry, jovial face looked\nparticularly promising for the extra week.  And now the Doctor advances\nto the table with the prize list in his hand.  The prize boys are\nmarshalled in the background, in the order in which their names appear,\nand Bramble tries hard to look as if nothing but his duty to his\ngrandmother would have kept him from forming one of that favoured band\nhimself.\n\nThe prize list is arranged backwards way; that is, the small boys come\non first and the great events last.\n\nIt is a treat to see the little mites of the First, Second, and Third\nJunior trot up to get their prizes.  They look so pleased, and they\nblush so, and look so wistfully up to where their relatives are sitting,\nthat it is quite pathetic, and the good old Earl has a vigorous wipe of\nhis spectacles before he calls up the Fourth Junior.\n\n\"General proficiency,\" reads the Doctor from his list--\"Watson.\"  No one\nknows Watson; he is quite an obscure member of the glorious community,\nand so he trots in and out again without much excitement.  In fact, all\nthe best prizes of the Form go without much applause, but when the\nDoctor summons \"Paul\" to advance and receive \"the second arithmetic\nprize,\" there rises a shout enough to bring down the house.\n\n\"Bravo, Guinea-pigs!\" shouts one small voice up somewhere near the\nceiling, whereat there is a mighty laugh and cheer, and Bramble turns\ncrimson in the face, and tells his grandmother gloomily, \"That fellow\nPaul is a beast!\"\n\nBut the youth's face brightens when the next name is called: \"Third\narithmetic--Padger.\"\n\nThen doth Bramble the Tadpole stand in his seat and cheer till he is\nhoarse, and till his grandmother pulleth him by the tail of his jacket.\nThe hero Padger, perspiring very much in the face, but otherwise\ncomposed, takes the homage of his chief and the third arithmetic prize\nwith becoming humility, and clears off the arena as fast as he\nconveniently can.\n\nSurely the Fourth Junior have come to an end now!  No! there is one more\nprize.\n\n\"First Latin--Greenfield junior.\"\n\nThis time there was a louder cheer than ever, for Stephen is a popular\nboy outside his own class.  Oliver joins in the cheer, and Pembury and\nWraysford and one or two others, and of course the Guinea-pigs, go in a\nlump for him.  It is quite a minute before the noble Earl can get hold\nof the words of presentation; and when at last Stephen is dispatched,\nthe Doctor turns round and says, \"If you boys will make a _little_ less\nnoise I dare say we shall get through the list quite as satisfactorily,\nand possibly a little more quickly.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" says one of the governors, and nod, nod goes the noble\nEarl's head.\n\nThe consequence of this is that the prizes to the First, Second, Third,\nand Fourth Senior are presented amid something very much like silence,\nwhich, however, grows less and less solemn as the proceedings go on.\nThe last Fourth Senior boy to be called is the hero Forrester, who is\nnow fully constituted a member of the first football fifteen.  He gets a\nvehement cheer at all costs, mingled with shouts of \"Well kicked, sir!\"\n\n\"Hack it through!\" and the like, which clearly show that the sympathy of\nSaint Dominic's is quite as much with the exploits accomplished by the\nyoung hero's feet as by those of his head.\n\nNow for the Fifth!  If the Doctor expects the company is to remain\nsolemn during the next quarter of an hour he knows nothing at all about\nthe school over which he presides.\n\n\"Fifth Form--(cheers)--French--(cheers)--Pembury--(terrific applause,\nduring which Tony walks in demurely on his crutches and receives his\nwell-merited award).  English history--(applause)--Pembury.\"\n\nOnce more enter Tony on his crutches to receive another prize.\n\n\"Bravo, Tony!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the _Dominican_!\"\n\n\"Well done, Editor!\" rise from various parts of the hall, in the midst\nof which Pembury retires positively for the last time.\n\n\"First Greek prize--Wraysford.\"\n\nWraysford advances gravely and slowly.  The instant he appears there\narises a cheer--the mightiest of any yet.  Everybody cheers, and when\nthey have done cheering they stamp, and when they have done stamping\nthey clap.  Wraysford stands disconcerted and flushed with the\ndemonstration, at a loss whether to smile or frown.  He knows the\nmeaning of that cheer as well as anybody, and it grates on his ear\nunpleasantly as he listens.  What ages it seems before it is done, and\nthe noble Earl at last holds out the book and says, \"I have great\npleasure, Wraysford, in handing you this prize.  Your schoolfellows are\nall proud of you; I feel sure you deserve their good opinion.  I wish\nyou success, Wraysford;\" and so saying, the good old gentleman bobs\naffably, and Wraysford, amid another tempest of applause, bows too, and\ntakes off his prize.\n\n\"The next name,\" says the Doctor, referring to his list, \"is that of the\nwinner of the Nightingale Scholarship--(sensation)--and I may tell your\nlordship that the boy is, in the opinion of his examiners and myself,\none of the most promising boys for his age that Saint Dominic's has\nknown.  The examiners report that his answers to the questions on the\npaper deserve the greatest credit.  I will say only this before his\nface: Nightingale Scholarship--Greenfield senior.\"\n\nA solemn silence marks the close of the Doctor's speech, in the midst of\nwhich Oliver, with pale face, but otherwise unmoved, advances to where\nthe noble Earl stands.  A few of the strangers greet his appearance with\na clapping of hands, but the sound falls strangely on the silence all\nround.\n\nThe noble Earl, who is evidently ready with a neat little speech which\nshall sum the applause that never comes, is disconcerted at this\nunwonted stillness.  You might hear a pin fall as the old gentleman, in\ndumb show, places the certificate into the boy's hand and tries to get\nat the words which the silence has scared away.\n\nOliver waits no longer than he can help.  With a bow, he takes the\nparchment and turns to quit the scene.\n\nIt is at this moment, that somewhere or other in the hall, there rises a\nfaint, almost whispered, hiss.  Slight as it is, it falls with startling\neffect upon the dead silence which reigns.  Then, like the first whisper\nof a storm, it suddenly grows and swells and rushes, angrily and\nwitheringly, about the head of the wretched Oliver.  Then as suddenly it\ndies away into silence, and the presentation of the Nightingale\nScholarship is at an end.\n\nThe visitors, the committee, the ladies, the noble Earl, look about them\nin blank astonishment and misery.  The Doctor's face flushes up mightily\nas he glares for one instant around him, and then drops his head over\nthe prize list.\n\nThe only thing there is for him to do he does.  He calls on the next\nname as composedly as he can, and proceeds with the business of the day.\n\nBut the magic has suddenly gone out of prize-day, and no coaxing can\nbring it back.  The Fifth, and after them the Sixth, advance and receive\ntheir rewards amidst the listless indifference of the audience, and\nuncheered by the faintest spark of enthusiasm.  No one takes the trouble\nto cheer anybody.  Even Raleigh, the captain, comes in and out almost\nunheeded; and when at last the final name is reached, it is a relief to\nevery one.\n\nThe rest of the day drags heavily--it is no use trying to get up the\nsteam.  The visitors are out of humour, and the noble Earl leaves early.\nThe musical feast provided by the glee club is a failure altogether.  A\nfew only come to it, and nothing interferes with music like a poor\naudience.\n\nAs to the charade, it is abandoned at the last moment.\n\nThen a great many mothers and aunts make the discovery that there is an\nevening train from Maltby; and having made it, act upon it; and the tide\nof emigration sets out forthwith.\n\nAmong the first to depart is Wraysford.\n\nAs he appears at the school door, trunk in hand, waiting for the school\nomnibus (which vehicle, by the way, is having a busy time of it),\nPembury hobbles up, similarly equipped for the road.\n\n\"You off by this train?\" says the latter to Wraysford.\n\n\"Yes; are you?\"\n\n\"I may as well.  I can get home by nine; and my people won't be in a\ngreat rage if I turn up earlier than they expect.\"\n\n\"Well, we may as well get a fly as wait for the wretched omnibus,\" says\nWraysford.  \"Come along; there are flies at the corner of Hall Street.\"\n\nOut walked the two, saying good-bye to one or two on the road.  At the\ndrive gate two boys are standing waiting for the omnibus.  Wraysford and\nPembury are upon them before they observe that these are Oliver and his\nbrother.\n\nWhat is to be done?  There is no escaping them--they must pass; yet both\nof them, somehow, would at that moment--they couldn't tell why--have\ndropped into the earth.\n\nOliver looks up as they approach.\n\nNow or never!  Wraysford feels he must say something!\n\n\"Good-bye, Greenfield,\" he says.  \"I hope--\"\n\nOliver quietly takes Stephen's arm and turns on his heel.\n\nWraysford stares after him for a moment, and then slowly goes on his\nway, breathing hard.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Pembury, after a long silence--\"I wonder, Wray, if it's\npossible we are wrong about that fellow?\"\n\nWraysford says nothing.\n\n\"He doesn't act like a guilty person.  Just fancy, Wray,\"--and here Tony\npulls up short, in a state of perturbation--\"just fancy if you and I and\nthe rest have been making fools of ourselves all the term!\"\n\nAh! my Fifth Form heroes, just fancy!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30. A NEW TURN OF THE TIDE.\n\nThe three weeks of Christmas holiday darted past only too rapidly for\nmost of the boys at Saint Dominic's.  Holidays have a miserable knack of\nsliding along.  The first few days seem delightfully long.  Then, after\nthe first week, the middle all of a sudden becomes painfully near.  And\nthe middle once passed, they simply tear, and bolt, and rush pitilessly\non to the end, when, lo and behold! your time is up before you well knew\nit had begun.\n\nSo it happened with most of the boys.  With one or two, however, the\nholiday dragged heavily, and one of these was Master Thomas Senior.\nThis forlorn youth, no longer now rollicking Tom of the Fifth, but the\nmeek and mild, and withal sulky, hopeful of the Reverend Thomas Senior,\nD.D., of Saint Dominic's, watched the last of his chums go off with\nanything but glee.  He was doomed to three weeks' kicking of his heels\nin the empty halls and playgrounds of Saint Dominic's, with nothing to\ndo and no one to do it with.  For the boy's mother was ill, which kept\nthe whole family at home, and Tom's baby brother, vivacious youth as he\nwas, was hardly of a companionable age yet.\n\nAs to the Doctor (Tom, by the way, even in the bosom of his family,\nalways thought and talked of his father as the \"Doctor\")--as for the\nDoctor, well, Tom was inclined to shirk the risk of more _tete-a-tetes_\nthan he could possibly help with so formidable a personage, even though\nhe _was_ his own parent.\n\nBut try all he could, Tom was let in for it once, when he found himself\nface to face one day at dinner with the Doctor, and no third person to\nhelp him out.\n\nThe occasion was quite early in the holidays, and was indeed about the\nfirst opportunity the father had had since breaking-up for anything like\na conversation with his affable son.\n\nTom's conversational powers were never very brilliant, and when in the\nsubduing presence of his father they always dwindled down to nothing.\nIt was, therefore, somewhat difficult, under the circumstances, to keep\nthe talk going, but the Doctor did his best.  Tom answered in\nmonosyllables, and looked fearfully sheepish, and found his best policy\nwas always to keep his mouth full, and so have the excuse of good\nmanners on his side for his silence.\n\n\"Tom,\" said the Doctor, presently, steering round to a subject which it\nhad been for some time in his mind to question his son about, \"that was\nan extraordinary demonstration on prize-day, when Greenfield senior came\nup to get his scholarship.\"\n\n\"It wasn't me,\" said Tom, colouring up.\n\n\"My dear boy, I never supposed it was,\" said the Doctor, laughing.  \"But\nit surprised me very much, as well as pained me.\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" again said Tom.\n\n\"Of course you couldn't, Tom.  But I am sorry to find Greenfield is so\nunpopular in the school.\"\n\nThe Doctor did not care to put a direct question to Tom on the matter\nthat was perplexing him.  He hoped to draw him out by more indirect\nmeans.  But he was mistaken if he ever expected it, for Tom, with the\nperversity of a fellow who _will_ take everything that is said as a\nrebuke to himself, showed no inclination to follow the lead.  The Doctor\nhad, therefore, to ask outright.\n\n\"What dreadful crime has he committed, Tom, to be treated so severely?\"\n\n\"I don't want to treat him severely,\" said Tom.  \"Tom,\" said the Doctor,\nhalf angrily, \"you are very foolish.  I was not referring to you\nparticularly, but to the whole school.\"\n\nTom sulked at this more than ever.  _He_ wasn't going to be called\nfoolish.  The Doctor, however, tried once more.\n\n\"What has he done to offend you all?  Has he missed a catch at cricket,\nor a kick at football?  I hope, whatever it is--\"\n\n\"It isn't me!\" once more growled Tom, heartily wishing the meal was\nover.\n\nThe Doctor gave it up as a bad job.  There was no use trying to get a\nrise out of Tom.  If that ingenuous youth had been trying to shield his\nForm, he could not have done it better.  As it was, he was only stupidly\ntrying to shield himself, and letting his dread of his \"Doctor\" father\nget the better of his common sense and good manners.\n\nLuckily for Tom, a friend wrote to invite him to spend the last week of\nthe holidays in London, an invitation which that youth, as well as his\nparent for him, thankfully accepted.  Indeed, during the holidays Mrs\nSenior became so ill that the poor Doctor had no thoughts to spare for\nanybody or anything but her and her hope of recovery.  He watched her\nnight and day through all the vicissitudes of her fever, and when at\nlast the crisis was over, and the doctors said she would recover, they\nsaid also that unless Dr Senior wanted to have an illness himself he\nmust go away and get perfect rest and change for a week or two at the\nvery least.\n\nThe consequence of all this was that Saint Dominic's had to reassemble\nafter the Christmas holidays without the Doctor.\n\nTo some of the boys this was sorrowful news; others regarded the\ncircumstance with indifference, while one section there was who received\nthe intelligence with positive joy.\n\nStrange that that section should contain in it two such opposites as\nLoman of the Sixth and Bramble of the Fourth Junior.\n\nLoman, despite his \"run of luck,\" had spent an uneasy holiday.  He had\nbeen in constant terror of seeing Cripps every time he ventured outside\nhis house; and he had been in still more terror of Cripps calling up at\nSaint Dominic's and telling the Doctor all about him directly after the\nholidays.  For now Loman's time was up.  Though he had in one way and\nanother paid off all his debt to the landlord of the Cockchafer but\neight pounds, still he knew Cripps could make himself quite as\nunpleasant about eight pounds as about thirty pounds, and probably\nwould.\n\nBut as long as the Doctor was away it didn't matter so much.  And,\nbesides, the examination for the exhibition would of course be\npostponed, which meant so much longer time for preparation--which meant\nso much better chance for Loman of winning it.  For, when he tried, he\ncould work hard and effectively.\n\nSo Loman was very glad to hear the Doctor was away ill.  So was Bramble!\n\nThat youth (who, by the way, had during the holidays quite recovered\nfrom the sobering effect of his grandmother's visit to the school) was\nalways on a look-out for escaping the eye of the constituted\nauthorities.  He hardly ever saw the Doctor from one month's end to\nanother; but somehow, to know he was away--to know any one was away who\nought to be there to look after him--was a glorious opportunity!  He\nlaunched at once into a series of revolutionary exploits on the strength\nof it.  He organised mutinies ten times a day, and had all the\nspecifications drawn up for blowing up Saint Dominic's with paraffin\noil.  There was nothing, in short, Bramble would not venture while the\nDoctor was away; and there is no knowing how far he might have carried\nhis bloodthirsty conspiracies into effect had not Mr Rastle caught him\none day with a saw, sawing the legs off the writing-master's stool, and\ngiven him such a chastisement, bodily and mental, as induced him for a\nbrief season to retire from public life, and devote all his spare time\nto copying out an imposition.\n\nOn the first morning after reassembling, Mr Jellicott, the master in\ncharge of Saint Dominic's, summoned the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth to meet\nhim in the lecture-theatre, and there announced to them the reason of\nthe head master's absence.\n\n\"In consequence of this,\" said Mr Jellicott, \"the removes gained last\nterm will not be put into force for a week or two, till the head master\nreturns; but, meanwhile, Dr Senior is anxious that the work of the\nschool should go on as usual.  We shall, therefore, resume studies\nto-morrow; and on Monday next the examination for the Waterston\nExhibition will be held, as arranged.  The three boys--Loman, Greenfield\nsenior, and Wraysford--entered for this will be excused ordinary lessons\ntill after the examination.\"\n\nGreenfield senior!  Then Oliver _was_ in for it after all!  The\nannouncement amazed Wraysford as much as it did Loman and every one\nelse.  It had never entered their minds that he would go in for it.\nHadn't he got the Nightingale? and wasn't that enough for one half-year?\nAnd didn't every one know _how_ he had got it, and how could the fellow\nnow have the assurance to put in for another examination?\n\nOliver always had been a queer fellow, and this move struck every one as\nqueerer than ever.\n\nBut to Wraysford and one or two others it occurred in a different light.\nIf Oliver had really won the Nightingale in the manner every one\nsuspected, he would hardly now boldly enter for another examination, in\nwhich he might possibly not succeed, and so prove those suspicions to be\ntrue.  For the subjects were almost exactly the same as those examined\nin for the Nightingale, and unless Oliver did as well here as he did\nthere--and that was _remarkably_ well--it would be open for anybody to\nsay, \"Of course--he couldn't steal the paper this time, that's why!\"\n\nWraysford, as he thought over it, became more and more uneasy and\nashamed of himself.  One moment he persuaded himself Oliver was a\nhypocrite, and the next that he was innocent.  \"At any rate,\" said he to\nhimself, \"this examination will settle it.\"\n\nIn due time the examination day came, and once more the three rivals\nheard their names called upon to come forward and occupy that memorable\nfront desk in the Sixth Form room.\n\nThis time at any rate there had been no chance for any one to take an\nunfair advantage, for the Doctor's papers did not reach Saint Dominic's\ntill the morning of the examination.  Indeed, Mr Jellicott was opening\nthe envelope which contained them when the boys entered the room.\n\nAny one closely observing the three boys as they glanced each down his\npaper would once more have been struck by the strange contrast in their\nfaces.  Oliver's, as his eyes glanced rapidly down the page, was\ncomposed and immovable; Wraysford's, as he looked first at his paper and\nthen hurriedly at Oliver and Loman, was perplexed and troubled; Loman's\nwas blank and pale and desponding.\n\nBut of the three, the happiest that morning was Wraysford--not that he\nwas sure of success, not that his conscience was clear of all reproach,\nbut because, as he sat there, working hard himself and hearing some\none's pen on his left flying with familiar sound quickly over the paper,\nhe felt at last absolutely sure that he had misjudged his friend, and\nequally resolved that, come what would of it, and humiliating as the\nconfession would be, he would, before that day ended, be reconciled to\nOliver Greenfield.  What mattered it to him, then, who won the\nexhibition?  Loman might win it for all _he_ cared, as long as he won\nback his friend.\n\nHowever, Loman at that moment did not look much like winning anything.\nIf he had been in difficulties in the former examination, he was utterly\nstranded now.  He tried first one question, then another, but no\ninspiration seemed to come; and at last, after dashing off a few lines\nat random, he laid down his pen, and, burying his face in his hands,\ngave himself up to his own wretched thoughts.  He must see Cripps soon;\nhe must go to him or Cripps would come up to Saint Dominic's, and then--\n\nWell, Loman did not do much execution that morning, and was thankful\nwhen presently Mr Jellicott said, \"Time will be up in five minutes,\nboys.\"\n\nThe announcement was anything but welcome to the other two competitors,\nboth of whom were writing, hammer and tongs, as though their lives\ndepended on it.  Loman looked round at them and groaned as he looked.\nWhy should they be doing so well and he be doing so ill?\n\n\"Look at those two beggars!\" said Callonby to Stansfield, in a whisper,\npointing to Wraysford and Oliver.  \"There's a neck-and-neck race for\nyou!\"\n\nSo it was.  Now Oliver seemed to be getting over the ground quicker, and\nnow Wraysford.  Now Wraysford lost a good second by looking up at the\nclock; now Greenfield made a bad shot with his pen at the inkpot, and\nhad to dip again, which threw him back half a second at least.\n\nUnconscious of the interest and amusement they were exciting among the\nsporting section of the Sixth, they kept the pace up to the finish, and\nwhen at last Mr Jellicott said, \"Cease writing and bring up your\npapers,\" both groaned simultaneously, as much as to say, \"A second or\ntwo more would have done it.\"\n\nThe examination was over, but the event of that memorable day was still\nto take place.\n\nFive minutes later Oliver, who had retired alone, as usual, to his\nstudy, there to announce to the anxious Stephen how he had fared in the\nexamination, caught the sudden sound of an old familiar footstep outside\nhis door, which sent the blood to his cheeks with strange emotion.\nStephen heard it, and knew it too.\n\n\"There's that beast Wraysford,\" he said, at the very instant that\nWraysford, not waiting to knock, flung open the door and entered.\n\nThere was no need for him to announce his errand.  It was written on his\nface as he advanced with outstretched hand to his old friend.\n\n\"Noll, old man,\" was all he could say, as their eyes met, \"the\nyoungster's right--I _am_ a beast!\"\n\nAt the first word--the first friendly word spoken to him for months--\nOliver started to his feet like one electrified; and before the sentence\nwas over his hand was tightly grasping the hand of his friend, and\nStephen had disappeared from the scene.  It is no business of ours to\npry into that happy study for the next quarter of an hour.  If we did\nthe reader would very likely be disappointed, or perhaps wearied, or\nperhaps convinced that these two were as great fools in the manner of\ntheir making up as they had been in the manner of their falling out.\n\nOh! the happiness of that precious quarter of an hour, when the veil\nthat has divided two faithful friends is suddenly dashed aside, and they\nrush one to the other, calling themselves every imaginable bad name in\nthe dictionary, insisting to the verge of quarrelling that it was all\ntheir fault, and no fault at all of the other, far too rapturous to talk\nordinary common sense, and far too forgetful of everything to remember\nthat they are saying the same thing over and over again every few\nminutes.\n\n\"The falling out of faithful friends\"--as the old copybooks say in\nelegant Virgilian Latin--\"renewing is of love.\"  And so it was with\nOliver and Wraysford.\n\nWhy, they were twice the friends they were before!  Twice!  Fifty times!\nAnd they laughed and talked and made fools of themselves for a whole\nhalf-hour over the discovery, and might have done so for an hour, had\nnot Stephen, who had patiently remained outside for a reasonable time,\nnow returned to join in the celebration.\n\n\"Stee, you young beggar,\" said Wraysford, as the boy entered, \"if you\ndon't have my tea piping hot to-night, and fresh herrings for three done\nto a regular turn, I'll flay you alive, my boy.  And now, if you're\ngood, you may come and kick me!\"\n\nStephen, overflowing with joy, and quite rickety with emotion, flew at\nhis old friend, and, instead of kicking him, caught hold of his arm, and\nturning to his brother, cried, \"Oh, Noll! _isn't_ this prime?  Why,\nhere's old Wray--\"\n\n\"That beast Wraysford,\" suggested the owner of the title; \"do give a\nfellow his proper name, young 'un.\"\n\nThis little interruption put Stephen off his speech; and the three,\nlocking the study-door, settled down to talk rationally, or, at any\nrate, as rationally as they could, over affairs.\n\n\"You see,\" said Wraysford, \"I can't imagine now what possessed me to\nmake such a fool of myself.\"\n\n\"Now you needn't begin at that again,\" said Oliver.  \"If I hadn't cut up\nso at that jackass Simon, when he began about my being in the Doctor's\nstudy that evening, it would never have happened.\"\n\n\"Bah! any one might have known the fellow was telling lies.\"\n\n\"But he wasn't telling lies,\" said Oliver.  \"I _was_ in the Doctor's\nstudy all alone that evening, and at the very time the paper went too.\nThat's just the queer thing about it.\"\n\n\"You were?\" exclaimed both the boys, for this was news even to Stephen.\n\n\"Yes, of course I was.  Don't you know I went to see him about Stephen,\nand that row he had up at the Lock?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Stephen, \"I remember.  I was in a regular blue funk that\nevening.\"\n\n\"Well, the Doctor wasn't there.  I hung about a few minutes for him, and\nthen, as he didn't turn up, I left, and met that old booby just as I was\ncoming out of the door.\"\n\n\"And he's gone and told everybody he saw you coming out with the paper\nin your pocket.\"\n\nOliver laughed loud at this.\n\n\"Upon my word, the fellow must have sharp eyes if he could do that!\nWell, I was so disgusted when he came up after the examination, and\nbegan to insinuate that I knew all about the missing paper, that--Well,\nyou know how I distinguished myself.\"\n\n\"It would have served him right if you'd throttled him,\" observed\nWraysford.  \"But I say, Noll,\" added he more gravely, \"why on earth, old\nman, didn't you say all this then?  What a lot of unpleasantness it\nwould have saved.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Oliver, suddenly firing up, \"do you suppose, when the\nfellows all chose to believe that miserable idiot's story, I was going\nto stir a finger or bother myself a snap about what they thought?  Bah!\nI'm not angry now, Wray; but, upon my word, when I think of that time--\"\n\n\"What a pack of curs we all were,\" said Wraysford, almost as angry as\nhis friend.\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" put in Stephen, an observation which had the effect of\nmaking the whole thing ridiculous and so restoring both the friends to\ntheir composure.\n\n\"But, Noll, I say, old man,\" said Wraysford, presently, \"of course you\ndidn't intend it, but if you meant to make every one believe you did it,\nyou couldn't have gone on better than you did.  I'm certain not half the\nfellows would have believed Simon if you hadn't--\"\n\n\"Made such an ass of myself,\" said Oliver, laughing.  \"Of course I can\nsee now how it would all work in beautifully against me, and I'm certain\nI've myself to thank for the whole business.\"\n\n\"Now, don't say that.  Nothing can excuse the way all of us treated you,\npoor old boy.  But, thank goodness, it's all right now.  I'll let them\nknow--\"\n\n\"Now, Wray, that's just what I won't have you do.  You must not say a\nword to them about it, or, seriously, I'll be in a great rage.  If they\ncan't think well of me of their own accord, I won't have them do it for\nanybody else's, so there.\"\n\n\"But, Noll, old man--\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Wray, I mean what I say.  Not a word to anybody.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you intend to live at Coventry all your life?\"\n\n\"It's not Coventry now, is it, Stee, old boy?\" said Oliver, with a\nbright smile.  \"And now, Wray,\" said he, \"I want to know how you got on\nin the exam to-day.  You were going ahead furiously, it seemed to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, but wasn't doing much good, I'm afraid.  How have you done?\"\n\n\"Pretty well; but I hadn't time to touch the last question.\"\n\n\"I knew, as soon as I saw you were entered for the exam,\" said\nWraysford, \"we had all been taking you up wrong.  I can guess now why\nyou went in for it.\"\n\n\"Well, it struck me it might be a way of putting myself right with the\nfellows if I won; but I'm half afraid I won't win, and then their\nhighnesses will be doubly sure of my villainy!\"\n\n\"I know you will win,\" said Wraysford.\n\n\"If I do I shall feel an awful blackguard, for you would have been\ncertain of it.\"\n\n\"I'm not so very sure.  However, I think I could have beaten Loman.\"\n\n\"He seemed out of it, quite.  Do you know I think that fellow is going\nto the dogs altogether?\"\n\n\"Pity,\" said Wraysford, \"if he is, but it does look like it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31. LOMAN IN LUCK AGAIN.\n\nIt certainly did look as if Loman was going to the dogs.  And any one\nable to see and know all that was going on in his mind would have found\nout that he was a good deal nearer \"the dogs\" even than he seemed.\n\nOn the evening after the examination he received a note from Cripps--\nbrought up in a most barefaced way by one of the potboys at the\nCockchafer--requesting the pleasure of Mr Loman's company at that\npleasant spot _immediately_, to talk over business!\n\n\"Why didn't he send it by post?\" demanded Loman, angrily, of the\ndisreputable messenger.  \"Don't you know if you were seen up here\nthere'd be a row?\"\n\n\"Dunno so much about that, but the governor, he says he's dead on the\njob this time, he says, and if you don't show up sharp with the stumpy,\nhe says he'll give you a call himself and wake you up, he says--\"\n\n\"Tell him I'll come, and go off quick,\" said Loman, hurriedly.\n\n\"Beg pardon, mister,\" said the potboy, with a leer, and touching his\ncap, \"anything allowed for this here little job--carrying up the\nletter?\"\n\n\"I'll allow you a kick if you don't go!\" exclaimed the wretched Loman,\nfuriously.\n\n\"Oh, very good,\" said the boy, making a long nose.  \"Wait till the\ngovernor walks up.  We'll see who'll kick then!\"\n\nAnd so saying the amiable and respectable youth departed.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Wren, coming up just at this moment, \"who's your friend,\nLoman?  He looks a nice sort of boy!\"\n\nWren was now captain and head monitor at Saint Dominic's--far too blunt\nand honest ever to be an object of anything but dislike and uneasiness\nto Loman.  Now the uneasiness was the more prominent of the two.  Loman\nreplied, confused and reddening, \"Oh, that boy?  Why--oh, he's a\nshop-boy from the town, come up about an order--you know--for a\nhat-box.\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Do you mean Morris's boy?\"\n\n\"Ye--yes.  A new boy of Morris's.\"\n\n\"Well, whoever he is, he's a precious cheeky specimen.  Why didn't you\nkick him?\"\n\n\"Eh?  Kick him?  Yes, I was just going to,\" began Loman, scarcely\nknowing what he said, \"when--\"\n\n\"When I turned up?  Well, I shouldn't have interfered.  By the way,\nLoman, I suppose you've given up going to that public now?  What's the\nfellow's name?\"\n\n\"Cripps,\" said Loman.  \"Oh, I never go near the place now.\"\n\n\"That's a good job.  It was awkward enough his turning up as he did last\nterm, and all a chance the Doctor didn't hear of it, I can tell you.\nAnyhow, now I'm captain, that sort of thing will have to drop, mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, I assure you I've never been near the place since,\" said Loman,\nmeekly, anxious if possible to keep the new captain in humour, much as\nhe disliked him.\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" said Wren, coldly.\n\nJust at that moment a third personage arrived on the scene.  This was\nSimon, who approached, not noticing Wren, and crying out with his usual\ngush, \"Hullo, Loman, I say.  I saw Cripps to-day.  He was asking after\nyou.  He says you've not been down since last Sat--Hullo, Wren!\"\n\nAnd here the poet caught sight of the captain.\n\n\"So _you've_ been down to the Cockchafer, have you?\" inquired Wren.\n\n\"Well.  Oh, don't tell, Wren, I say.  I don't often go.  Ask Loman if I\ndo.  He's always there, and could easily tell if I went.  Do I go often,\nLoman?  Besides, I've given it up now!\"\n\n\"Quick work,\" observed Wren, drily, \"if you were down there this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Simon, shifting his ground slightly, \"I didn't think there\ncould be any harm, as Loman goes.  _He's_ a monitor.  And then I don't\nowe Cripps money, do I, Loman?  Or play cards and bet, like you, do I?\nOh, look here, Wren, do let us off this time.  Don't report me, there's\na good fellow.  I promise I won't do it again!  Oh, I say, Loman, beg us\noff.  I never let out on you--not even when you got--\"\n\nWren, who had allowed this burst of eloquence to proceed thus far, here\nturned sharply on his heel, and left the two companions in wrong in\npossession of the field.\n\nNext morning, when Loman got up, he found the following note on his\ntable:\n\n\"Wraysford takes your place as monitor.  The Doctor will be told you\nhave `resigned.'--C.W.\"\n\nLoman crushed the paper angrily in his hand, and muttered a curse as he\nflung it into the fire.  He felt little enough gratitude to Wren for\ndescribing him merely as resigned, and not, as was actually the case,\ndismissed.  Yet, even in his wretchedness, there was an atom of relief\nin knowing that at least a shred of his good old name remained.\n\nPoor shred indeed! but better than nothing.\n\nEvery one treated him as usual--except Wren, who cut him contemptuously.\nThe Sixth, ever since the exposure at the football match last term, had\nlost any respect they ever had for their comrade, and many had wondered\nhow it was he was still allowed to remain a monitor.  Every one now\nsupposed he had taken \"the better part of valour\" in resigning, and, as\nit mattered very little to any one what he did, and still less what he\nthought, they witnessed his deposition from the post of honour with\nprofound indifference.\n\nPoor Loman!  Some righteous reader will be shocked at my pitying such a\nfoolish, miserable failure of a fellow as this Edward Loman; and yet he\nwas to be pitied, wasn't he?  He hadn't been naturally a vicious boy, or\na cowardly boy, or a stupid boy, but he had become all three; and as he\nsat and brooded over his hard luck, as he called it, that morning, his\nmind was filled with mingled misery and fear and malice towards every\none and everything, and he felt well-nigh desperate.\n\nHis interview with Cripps came off that afternoon.  The landlord of the\nCockchafer, as the reader may have gathered, had changed his tone pretty\nconsiderably the last few days, and Loman found it out now.\n\n\"Well?\" said he, gloomily, as the boy entered.\n\n\"Well?\" said Loman, not knowing how to begin.\n\n\"I suppose you've got my money?\" said Cripps.\n\n\"No, Cripps, I haven't,\" said the boy.\n\n\"All right,\" said Cripps; \"that's quite enough for me;\" and, to Loman's\nastonishment and terror, he walked away without another word, and left\nthe unhappy boy to stay or go as he pleased.\n\nLoman could not go, leaving things thus.  He must see Cripps again, if\nit was only to know the worst.  So he stayed in the bar for the\nlandlord's return.  Cripps took no notice of him, but went on with his\nordinary pursuits, smiling to himself in a way which perfectly terrified\nhis victim.  Loman had never seen Cripps like this before.\n\n\"Cripps,\" he said, after half an hour's waiting--\"Cripps, I want to\nspeak to you.\"\n\n\"You may want,\" was the surly reply.  \"I've done with you, young\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cripps, don't talk like that!  I do mean to pay you, every\nfarthing, but--\"\n\n\"Yes, you're very good at meaning, you are,\" said the other.  \"Anyhow,\nit don't much matter to me _now_.\"\n\n\"What _do_ you mean, Cripps?  Oh, do give me a little more time!  A\nweek--only a week longer.\"\n\n\"Aren't you done?\" was the only reply; \"aren't you going home?\"\n\n\"Will you, Cripps?  Have pity on me!  I'm so miserable!\"\n\nCripps only whistled pleasantly to himself.\n\nLoman, almost frantic, made one last effort.\n\n\"Give us just a week more,\" he entreated.\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Do speak, Cripps; say you will; please do!\"\n\nCripps only laughed and went on whistling.\n\n\"Oh, what shall I do, what _shall_ I do?\" cried the wretched boy.  \"I\nshall be ruined if you don't have some pity--\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Cripps, curtly, \"you'd better stop that noise here, my\nlad.  You can go; do you hear?  Look alive.\"\n\nIt was no use staying further.  Loman went What anguish he endured for\nthe next twenty-four hours no one knows.  What plans he turned in his\nhead, what wild schemes, what despair, what terrors filled him, only he\nhimself could tell.  Every moment he expected the fatal vision of Cripps\nat Saint Dominic's, and with it his own certain disgrace and ruin, and,\nas time went on, his perturbation became so great that he really felt\nill with it.\n\nBut Cripps did not come that day or the next.  The next day was one of\nmighty excitement in Saint Dominic's.  The result of the examination for\nthe Waterston Exhibition was announced.\n\nHad any other three boys but those actually taking part been the\ncompetitors, few outsiders would have felt much interest in the result\nof an ordinary examination confined to Sixth Form boys.  But on this\noccasion, as we have seen, the general curiosity was aroused.  No one\nexpected much of Loman.  The school had discovered pretty well by this\ntime that he was an impostor, and their chief surprise had been that he\nshould venture into the list against two such good men as Oliver and\nWraysford.\n\nBut which of those two was to win?  That was the question.  Every one\nbut a few had been positive it would be Wraysford, whom they looked upon\nas the lawful winner of the Nightingale last term, and whom, they were\nconvinced, Oliver was unable to beat by fair means.  And yet to these it\nhad been a great astonishment to hear that Oliver had entered for the\nexamination.  Unless he was certain of winning he would only do himself\nharm by it, and confirm the suspicions against him.  And yet, if he\nshould win after all--if he was able fairly to beat Wraysford--why\nshould he have gone to the trouble last term of stealing the examination\npaper and making himself the most unpopular boy in all Saint Dominic's?\n\nThese questions sorely exercised the school, and made them await eagerly\nthe announcement of the result.\n\nThe news came at last.\n\n\"I have just received,\" said Mr Jellicott that morning, when the Fifth\nand Sixth were assembled together in the lecture-theatre--\"I have just\nreceived from the examiners the report on the Waterston examination.\nThe result is as follows: First--Greenfield, 108 marks; second--\nWraysford, 96 marks; third--Loman, 20 marks.\"\n\nHere Mr Jellicott was interrupted by a laugh and a muttered \"Bravo,\nLoman! very good!\" in what sounded to the knowing something like\nPembury's voice.  The master looked up and frowned angrily, and then\nproceeded: \"The examiners add an expression of their very high approval\nof Greenfield's answers.  The highest marks obtainable were 120, and,\nconsidering he left the last question untouched--doubtless for want of\ntime--they feel that he has passed with very great distinction, and\nfully in accordance with their expectations of the winner of the\nNightingale Scholarship last term.  We will now proceed to the usual\nlessons.\"\n\nThis announcement made the strangest impression on all present.  No one\nattempted any demonstration, but while Mr Jellicott was speaking many\nperplexed and troubled faces turned to where Oliver, by the side of his\nfriend Wraysford, was sitting.  Wraysford's face was beaming as he\nclapped his friend on the back.  Oliver looked as unconcerned and\nindifferent as ever.  The fellow _was_ a puzzle, certainly.\n\nAs soon as lesson was over, the Fifth retired to its own quarters in a\nperturbed state of mind, there to ponder over what had happened.  Oliver\nspared them the embarrassment of his society as usual, and Wraysford was\nnot there either.  So the Fifth were left pretty much to their own\ndevices and the guidance of some lesser lights.\n\n\"Isn't it queer?\" said Ricketts.  \"Whoever would have thought of it\nturning out like this?\"\n\n\"One could understand it,\" said Braddy, \"if there had been any chance of\nhis repeating the dodge of last term.  But he couldn't have done that.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said another; \"he may have been up to some other dodge.\nPerhaps he copied off Wraysford.\"\n\n\"Hardly likely,\" said Bullinger, \"up on the front desk just under\nJellicott's nose.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't make it out at all,\" said Ricketts.\n\n\"Nor can I,\" said Bullinger.\n\nAll this while Pembury had not spoken, but he now turned to Simon, and\nsaid, \"What do _you_ think, Simon?  Did you see Greenfield stealing the\nexamination paper this time, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not this time,\" promptly replied the poet; \"last term it was,\nyou know.  I didn't see him this time.\"\n\n\"Oh, you didn't even see him with it in his pocket?  Now, be very\ncareful.  Are you sure he didn't have it in his pocket a day before the\nexam?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Simon, laughing at Pembury's innocence, \"how could I see\nwhat was in a fellow's pocket, Pembury, you silly!  I can't tell what's\nin your pocket.\"\n\n\"Oh, can't you?  I thought you could, upon my honour.  I thought you saw\nthe paper in Greenfield's pocket last term.\"\n\n\"So I did.  That is--\"\n\nHere the wretched poet was interrupted by a general laugh, in the midst\nof which he modestly retired to the background, and left the Fifth to\nsolve the riddle in hand by themselves.\n\n\"Suppose,\" began Pembury, after a pause--\"suppose, when Braddy's done\nplaying the fool, if such a time ever comes--\"\n\nHere Braddy collapsed entirely.  He would sooner be sat upon by Dr\nSenior himself than by Pembury.\n\n\"Suppose,\" once more began Pembury, amid dead silence--\"suppose, instead\nof Greenfield senior being a thief and liar, I and all of you have been\nfools and worse for the last six months?  Wouldn't that be funny, you\nfellows?\"\n\n\"Why, whatever do you mean?\" demanded Tom Senior.\n\n\"Why, you don't suppose I mean anything, do you?\" retorted the\ncross-grained Tony.  \"What's the use of saying what you mean--\"\n\n\"But do you really--\" began Bullinger.\n\n\"I say, suppose I and you, Bullinger, and one or two others here who\nought to have known better, have been making fools of ourselves,\nwouldn't that be funny?\"\n\nThere was a pause, till Simon, plucking up heart, replied, \"Very funny!\"\n\nThe gravity even of Pembury broke down at this, and the present\nconference of the Fifth ended without arriving at any nearer conclusion\non the question which was perplexing it.\n\nMeanwhile, Oliver and Wraysford were in their study, talking over the\nevent of the day.\n\n\"I was certain how it would be, old boy,\" said Wraysford, genuinely\ndelighted.  \"I wonder what the Fifth will say now?  Bah! it doesn't\nbecome me to say too much, though, for I was as bad as any of them\nmyself.\"\n\n\"No, you weren't, old boy; you never really believed it.  But I say,\nWray, I don't intend to take this exhibition.  You must have it.\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed Wraysford.  \"Not a bit of me.  You won it.\"\n\n\"But I never meant to go in for it, and wouldn't have if it had not been\nfor the Fifth.  After all, it's only twenty pounds.  Do take it, old\nman.  I've got the Nightingale, you know.\"\n\n\"What does that matter?  I wouldn't have this for anything.  The fellows\ntried to make me think _I_ was the real winner of the Nightingale, and I\nwas idiot enough half to believe it.  But I think I've had a lesson.\"\n\n\"But, Wray--\"\n\n\"Not a word, my dear fellow; I won't hear of it.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; I shall shy the money when I get it into the nearest\nfish-pond.\"\n\n\"All serene,\" said Wraysford, laughing; \"I hope the fish will relish\nit.\"\n\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Oliver.\n\nThe door opened, and, to the astonishment of the two boys, Loman\nentered.\n\nWas it peace, or war, or what?  Loman's miserable face and strange\nmanner quickly answered the question.\n\n\"Oh, Greenfield,\" he said, \"excuse me.  I want to speak to you;\" and\nhere he glanced at Wraysford, who rose to go.\n\n\"Stay where you are, Wray,\" said Oliver.  \"What is it, Loman?\"\n\nLoman, quite cowed, hardly knew how to go on.\n\n\"I was glad to hear you got the Waterston,\" he said.  \"I--I thought you\nwould.\"\n\nWhat was the fellow at?\n\nAfter a long pause, which seemed to drive Loman almost to despair, he\nsaid, \"You'll wonder what I have come here for.  I know we've not been\nfriends.  But--but, Greenfield, I'm in awful trouble.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" again asked Oliver.\n\n\"Why, the fact is,\" said Loman, gaining courage, as he found neither\nOliver nor Wraysford disposed to resent his visit--\"the fact is,\nGreenfield, I'm in debt.  I've been very foolish, you know, betting and\nall that.  I say, Greenfield, _could_ you possibly--would you lend me--\neight pounds?  I don't know why I ask you, but unless I can pay the\nmoney to-day, I shall--\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Oliver, \"eight pounds to pay your bets?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not all bets.  I've been swindled too--by Cripps.  You know\nCripps.\"\n\nAnd here Loman, utterly miserable, threw himself down on a chair and\nlooked beseechingly at the two friends.\n\n\"I could pay you back in a month or so,\" he went on; \"or at any rate\nbefore Easter.  Do lend it me, please, Greenfield.  I don't know where\nelse to go and ask, and I shall get into such an awful row if I can't\npay.  Will you?\"\n\nOliver looked at Wraysford; Wraysford looked at Oliver; and then both\nlooked at Loman.  The sight of the wretched boy there entreating money\nof the very fellow who had least reason in all Saint Dominic's to like\nhim, was strange indeed.\n\n\"Wray,\" said Oliver, abruptly, after another pause, during which he had\nevidently made up his mind, \"have you any money about you?\"\n\n\"I've three pounds,\" said Wraysford, taking out his purse.\n\nOliver went to his desk and took from it a five-pound note which was\nthere, his savings for the last year.  This, with Wraysford's three\nsovereigns, he handed without a word to Loman.  Then, not waiting to\nhear the thanks which the wretched boy tried to utter, he took\nWraysford's arm and walked out of the study.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32. THE \"DOMINICAN\" COMES ROUND.\n\nThe Fifth were a good while coming round on the question of Greenfield\nsenior.  But the delay was more on account of pride than because they\nstill considered their old class-fellow a knave.  They had taken up such\na grand position last term, and talked so magnificently about honour,\nand morality, and the credit of the school, that it was a sad come-down\nnow to have to admit they had all been wrong, and still more that they\nhad all been fools.  And yet, after what had happened, they could no\nlonger retain their suspicions of Oliver Greenfield.\n\nA few of the better sort, like Pembury and Bullinger, had the courage,\nat whatever cost, to act up to their convictions, and declared at once\nthat they had been wrong, and were ashamed of it.\n\nThe next step was to approach Oliver, and that was more difficult, for\nhe was such a queer fellow there was no knowing where to have him.\nHowever, Pembury's wit helped him over the difficulty as usual.\n\nHe was hobbling down the passage one morning when he suddenly\nencountered Oliver and Wraysford, arm-in-arm, approaching him.  If at\nany time in his life Pembury did feel uncomfortable and awkward he felt\nit now.  If he let Oliver go by this time without making it up somehow,\nthe chance might never come again; but how to set about it, that was the\ndifficulty, and every half-second brought the two nearer.  Twenty\ndifferent ideas flashed through his mind.  He was not the sort of fellow\nto go to any one and eat humble-pie straight off.  That was far too tame\na proceeding.  No, there was only one way he could think of, and he\nwould chance that.\n\n\"Noll, old man,\" said he, in the old familiar tones, \"you've got a spare\narm.  May I take it?\"\n\nOliver stopped short and looked at him for an instant in astonishment.\nNext moment, with a hearty \"Rather!\" he slipped his arm into that of the\nhappy Pembury, and the three went on their way rejoicing, a sight and a\nmoral for all Saint Dominic's.\n\nThat was the whole of Anthony Pembury's making up.  As for Bullinger, he\nwrote his man a letter, worded in beautiful English, in the most elegant\nhandwriting and punctuated to a nicety, setting forth his contrition,\nand his hope that Greenfield would henceforth reckon him among his\nfriends--\"Yours very sincerely, H. Bullinger.\"  This literary effort he\ncarefully dispatched by a Guinea-pig to its destination, and awaited a\nreply with the utmost impatience.  The reply was laconic, but highly\nsatisfactory.  It was a verbal one, given by Oliver himself in class\nthat afternoon, who volunteered the information to the delighted\nBullinger that it was a \"jolly day.\"\n\nIt was indeed a jolly day to that contrite youth.  He never believed it\nwould all be got over so easily.  He had dreaded all sorts of scenes and\nlectures and humiliations, but here he was, by a single word, passed\nback straight into friendship, and no questions asked.\n\nThe sight of Oliver surrounded by these three friends, of whom it would\nhave been hard to say which was the happiest, made a deep impression on\nthe rest of the Fifth, and certainly did not tend to make them feel more\ncomfortable as to what they ought to do in a similar direction.\n\n\"It's all very well,\" said Ricketts, when the question was being\ncanvassed for the hundredth time among his immediate friends.  \"I dare\nsay they are all right, but it makes it jolly uncomfortable for us.\"\n\n\"They oughtn't to have given in in this way without letting the rest of\nus know first,\" said Braddy.  \"Just see what a corner it puts us in.\"\n\n\"All I can say is,\" said Tom Senior, \"I'll be better satisfied when I\nknow who _did_ collar that paper if Greenfield didn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, but,\" said Simon, seeing a chance, \"I can assure you I saw him when\nhe took it.  I was going--\"\n\n\"Shut up, you great booby!\" cried Ricketts; \"who asked _you_ anything\nabout it?\"\n\nSimon modestly retired hereupon, and Braddy took up the talk.\n\n\"Yes, who did take the paper? that's it.  Greenfield must have done it.\nWhy, he as good as admitted it last term.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it's very queer those fellows making up to him,\" said\nRicketts.  \"It's no use our trying to send the fellow to Coventry when\nthe others don't back us up.\"\n\n\"Wraysford always was daft about Greenfield,\" said Tom Senior, \"but I am\nastonished at Pembury and Bullinger.\"\n\n\"All I can say is,\" said Braddy, \"Greenfield will have to ask me before\nI have anything to do with him.\"\n\n\"And do you know,\" said Ricketts, \"I heard to-day he is down to play in\nthe match against the County.\"\n\n\"Is he?\" exclaimed Braddy in excitement; \"very well, then.  _I_ shall\nnot play if he does.  That's all about that.\"\n\nRicketts laughed.\n\n\"Awfully sorry, old man, but you're not in the fifteen this time.\"\n\nBraddy's face was a picture at this moment--he turned red and blue and\nwhite in his astonishment.\n\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, as soon as he could find words.  \"I'm not in the\nteam!\"\n\n\"You'll see the list on the notice board; you'd better go and look.\"\n\nOff went the wretched Braddy to be convinced of his fate.\n\n\"You're in the team, Ricketts, I see,\" said Tom Senior.  \"Shall _you_\nplay if Greenfield does?\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" said Ricketts.  \"A fellow doesn't get a chance to play\nagainst the County every day.  It's precious awkward.\"\n\n\"So it is; that's just where we began, too,\" said Tom, philosophically.\nAnd, as a matter of fact, whenever these young gentlemen of the Fifth\nstarted the subject of Greenfield senior among themselves, they always\nfound themselves in the end at the identical place from which they had\nset out.\n\nNor were they the only boys at Saint Dominic's in this dilemma.  The\nGuinea-pigs and Tadpoles were equally taken aback by the new aspect of\naffairs.  These young gentlemen had looked upon Oliver's \"row\" with his\nclass as a peculiar mercy designed specially for their benefit.  They\nhad hardly known such a happy time as that during which the row had\nlasted.  Did they want a pretext for a battle?  Greenfield senior was a\nglorious bone of contention.  Did they want an object for an indignation\nmeeting?  What better object could they have than Greenfield senior?\nDid they want an excuse generally for laziness, disobedience, and\ntumult?  Greenfield senior served for this too.  Indeed, the name of the\nFifth Form Martyr had passed into a household word among the lower\nschool, either of glory or reproach, and round it the small fry rallied,\nas round an old flag of battle.\n\nBut now, both friend and foe were aghast.  To the Guinea-pigs half the\ncharm of their position had been that they were Greenfield senior's sole\nchampions in all Saint Dominic's.  While every one else avoided him,\nthey stuck to him, week-days and Sundays.  Now, however, they\ndiscovered, with something like consternation, that they no longer had\nthe field to themselves.\n\nThe sight of Greenfield senior walking down the passage one day,\narm-in-arm with Wraysford, and the next day with one arm in Wraysford's\nand the other in Pembury's, and the day after between Pembury and\nBullinger, with Wraysford and Stephen in the rear, struck bewilderment\nand bitter jealousy to their hearts.\n\nThey had come out into the passage to cheer, but they went away silently\nand sadly, feeling that their very occupation was departed.\n\nBramble, always quick to see a chance, took advantage as usual of this\npanic.\n\n\"Hullo, I say, Guinea-pigs, you can shut up shop now, you know.  We're\ngoing to let off Greenfield senior this time, ain't we, Padger?  Jolly\nfellow, Greenfield senior.\"\n\nThis was abominable!  To have their hero and idol thus calmly taken out\nof their hands and appropriated by a set of sneaking Tadpoles was more\nthan human patience could endure!\n\n\"Bah!  A lot he'll care for _your_ letting him off!\" exclaimed Paul, in\ndire contempt.  \"He wouldn't touch you with a shovel.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he would, though, wouldn't he, Padger?  And what do you think,\nGuinea-pigs? _we're going to get Greenfield senior to take the chair at\none of our meetings_!\"\n\nBramble came out with the last triumphant announcement with a positive\nshout, which made the hearts of his adversaries turn cold.  In vain they\nlaughed the idea to scorn; in vain they argued that if for the last six\nmonths he had never said a word even to the Guinea-pigs, he would hardly\nnow come and take up with the Tadpoles.  Bramble and Padger insisted on\ntheir story.\n\n\"Now, you fellows,\" concluded Bramble, at the end of another oration;\n\"those who say three cheers for Greenfield senior hold up--\"\n\nThe infuriated Paul here hurled the cap of a brother Guinea-pig, who was\nstanding near him, full at the face of the speaker, who thereupon,\naltering the current of his observations, descended from his form and\n\"went for\" his opponent.\n\nFrom that day a keener war raged round the head of Greenfield senior\nthan ever.  Not of attack and defence of his character, but of rivalry\nas to whom should be accounted his foremost champions.\n\nIt was at this critical period in the history of Saint Dominic's that a\nnew number of the _Dominican_ came out.  Pembury had been compelled to\nwrite it nearly all himself, for, in the present state of divided\nfeeling in the Fifth, he found it harder than ever to get contributions.\n\nEven those of his own way of thinking, Oliver, Wraysford, and Bullinger,\nbegged to be let off, and, indeed, the two former ingeniously pleaded\nthat, as they were now really Sixth Form fellows (though remaining in\ntheir old class till the Doctor came home), they had no right to have a\nhand in the Fifth Form magazine.  And their conscientious scruples on\nthis ground were so strong that no persuasions of Anthony's could shake\nthem.  So the unlucky editor had finally, as on a previous occasion, to\nretire into private life for a season, and get the whole thing out\nhimself, with only the aid of a few inches of \"Sonits\" from Simon.\n\nBut \"what man has done man can do,\" and this time the editor's efforts\nwere crowned with no less success than on the former occasion.\n\nThe _Dominican_ certainly did not seem to have lost its novelty, to\njudge by the crowd which once more assembled outside the classic portals\nof the Fifth, to peruse the contents of the now familiar big oak frame.\n\n\"School News\" was the first item of Tony's bill of fare.\n\nAfter announcing in appropriate terms the Doctor's illness, and\n\"universal hope of seeing him back in all his former vigour\" (one or two\nboys whistled low as they read this, and thought the editor might at\nleast have been content to \"speak for himself\"), Anthony went on to\nannounce the various school events which had happened since the\npublication of the last number.  Christmas prize-day of course came in\nfor a good share of the description, and contained a touch-off for\neverybody.\n\n\"The Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles,\" said the _Dominican_, \"looked quite\nunearthly in their cleanliness.  It was commonly reported that one or\ntwo of them had washed their faces twice in one week.  But this is\nhardly credible.  It is, however, a fact that Bramble was shut up in his\nstudy for half an hour with his grandmother and a basin of hot water,\nand that the conclusion come to from the yells and shrieks which\nproceeded from the torture-chamber that evening, and the appearance of\nthe dear child next day, is that he undoubtedly underwent one scrubbing\nthis term.\"\n\nBramble's face turned so purple at the reading of this that it was\nimpossible to say whether or not any traces of the scouring still\nremained.  He favoured Paul, who stood in front of him, with a furious\nkick, which that young gentleman, always punctual in his obligations,\npromptly repaid, and the two combatants somehow managed to miss a good\ndeal of what immediately followed.\n\nAfter describing the other incidents of prize-day, the _Dominican_ went\non as follows:\n\n\"But the event of the day was the presentation of the Nightingale\nScholarship, which will be sufficiently fresh in our readers' memories\nto need no comment here, save this one word--that the only Dominican who\nbehaved himself like a gentleman during that remarkable scene was the\nwinner of the scholarship himself!\"\n\nThis was coming round with a vengeance!  The Fifth had half expected it,\nand now they felt more uncomfortable than ever.\n\nNor did the succeeding paragraphs leave them much chance of recovery.\n\n\"The Waterston Exhibition, our readers will be glad to hear, has been\nwon--and won brilliantly--by Oliver Greenfield, now of the Sixth.  No\nfellow in Saint Dominic's deserves the honour better.\"\n\nThen, as if his penitence were not yet complete, Pembury went on boldly\nfarther on:\n\n\"Speaking of Greenfield senior, it is time some of us who have been\ndoing him injustice for a whole term did what little we could to make\namends now.  So here goes.  Take notice, all of you, that we, the\nundersigned, are heartily ashamed of our conduct to Greenfield senior,\nand desire all Saint Dominic's to know it.  Signed, A. Pembury, H.\nWraysford, T. Bullinger.\"\n\nThe effect of this manifesto was curious.  Pembury himself had been\nunable to prophesy how it would be taken.  The boys in front of the\nboard, as they heard it read out, couldn't tell exactly whether to laugh\nor be serious over the paragraph.  Most, however, did the latter, and\nhurried on to the next sentence:\n\n\"The following are also ashamed of themselves, but don't like to say so.\nThe _Dominican_ means to give them a leg up:--Tom Senior, G. Ricketts,\nR. Braddy, and the rest of the Fifth, except Simon, who never was or\ncould be ashamed of himself while he lived to write such pathetic,\nsoul-stirring lines as the following `Sonits:'\"\n\n[It was a great relief to one or two who stood by that Pembury had thus\ncunningly gone on from grave to gay, and left no pause after the very\nawkward paragraph about the Fifth.]\n\n  Sonit A.\n\n  To the _Dominican_.\n\n  I cannot write as I would like all in a noisy room\n  There's such a noise of mortal boys who sometimes go and come\n  Oh I will to the woods away all in the lonely shade\n  Where I no more of being disturbed need not to be afraid.\n\n  Sonit B.\n\n  To Dr Senior.\n\n  Dear Doctor I am very grieved to hear that you are not well\n  Oh cruel fate and yet methinks one cannot always tell\n  Things are so catching nowadays I wonder if I ever\n  Shall like unto the Doctor be by catching a low fever.\n\n  Sonit C.\n\n  To O-- G--.\n\n  Oh Greenfield melancholy wite hear me once before I go\n  'Tis sad to see the blossoms all in autumn time fall low\n  Canst thou recall that night in September when in the passage fair\n  I met you all so unexpectedly and you didn't seem to care\n  Oh may my hair turn white and me become a soreing lark\n  Before the memory of that day shines out in life's last spark.\n\n  [Wite, possibly wight.]\n\nThis was beautiful.  Saint Dominic's was beginning to appreciate poetry\nat last!  Simon was positively delirious with triumph when, after the\nburst of laughter (he called it applause) which greeted the reading of\nthis gem, some one cried out--\n\n\"Oh, I say! read that last one again, some one!\"  And then, amid\nredoubled hilarity, the whole effusion was encored.\n\nThe poet promptly sought out his enthusiastic admirer.\n\n\"Oh!  I say,\" said he, \"would you like a copy of it?\"\n\n\"Eh--oh, rather!\" was the reply.\n\n\"Very good.  You won't mind if I put a few more verses in, will you?\nPembury had to cut some out.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I shan't be happy unless I get at least twenty pages.\"\n\nSo off went the delighted Simon to work at this self-imposed task, and\ncaring little about the rest of the _Dominican_.\n\nBut some of that was worth reading, too.  Tony's leading article, for\ninstance, was an important document.  It was headed \"Gone Up,\" and\nbegan, \"Alas! our occupation's gone!  No longer will the _Dominican_ be\nable to bring its sledge-hammer down on high places and walk into the\nSixth.  For two of our men, O Fifth!--Greenfield and Wraysford--have\njoined the classic ranks of those who eat toffee in the top form, and\nplay `odds and evens' under the highest desks of Saint Dominic's.  We\nmust be careful now, or we shall catch it.  And yet we ought to\ncongratulate the Sixth!  At last they have got intelligence and high\nprinciple, and two good men behind a scrimmage among them; and more are\ncoming!  There's some hope for the Sixth yet, and we would not grudge\neven our two best men for such a good object as regenerating the top\nform of Saint Dominic's,\" and so on--not very flattering to the Sixth,\nor very comfortable for its two newest members, who, however, had\nprudently retired from the scene long ago, as soon as the first\nreferences to Oliver had been read out.\n\nThen came \"Notes from Coventry, continued,\" which were very brief.\n\"Since our last, the population of Coventry has undergone a change.  The\nformer inhabitant has walked out with flying colours, and the place is\nempty.  Who wants to go?\"\n\nThen came one or two odd paragraphs; one of them was:--\n\n\"By the way, the _Dominican_ wants to know why Loman is no longer a\nmonitor?  Do his engagements with friends in Maltby prevent his giving\nthe necessary time to this duty? or are the Sixth beginning to see that\nif they want order in the school they must have fellows who have at\nleast a little influence to do it?  They have done well in appointing\nWraysford.  But why is Loman resigned?  Who can tell?  It's a riddle.  A\nprize for the best answer in our next.\"\n\nThe finishing stroke, however, was Pembury's \"Notes and Queries from\nDown Below,\" supposed to be of special interest to the Fourth Junior.\nThe first was as follows:--\n\n\"Lessons.--Padger the Tadpole writes to ask, `How do you do lessons?'\nThe answer is a simple one, Padger.  If you are a member of the Fourth\nJunior, as we have a vague idea you are, the way of `doing' lessons\nthere is as follows: Sit at a desk full of old cherry-stones,\norange-peel, and dusty sherbet, and put your elbows on it.  Then with\nyour pen scatter as much ink as you conveniently can over your own\ncollar and face, and everybody else, without unduly exerting yourself.\nAfter that kick your right and left neighbours; then carefully rub your\nhands in the dust and pass them several times over your countenance, all\nthe while making the most hideous and abominable howls and shrieks you\ncan invent.  And then your lessons are `done.'\"\n\nThis paragraph so grievously incensed the honourable community at which\nit was directed, that for the first time for some months Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles made common cause to protest against the base insinuations it\ncontained.\n\nThe \"meeting\" in the Fourth Junior that afternoon lasted, on and off,\nfrom half-past four to half-past eight.  Among the speakers were\nBramble, Paul, and Stephen; while Padger, Walker, and Rook did very good\nexecution with their fists.  About half-past seven the dust was so dense\nthat it was impossible to see across the room; but those who knew\nreported that there was another row on about Greenfield senior, and that\nPaul and Padger were having their twenty-seventh round!  Anyhow, the\nGuinea-pigs and Tadpoles missed the rest of the _Dominican_, which,\nhowever, only contained one other paragraph of special interest:\n\n\"To-morrow week the football match of the season, School against County,\nwill be played in the Saint Dominic's meadow.  We are glad to say the\nSchool team will be a crack one, including this time Greenfield senior,\nand excluding one or two of the `incompetents' of last term.  The\nfollowing is the school fifteen:--Stansfield (football captain), Brown,\nWinter, Callonby, Duncan, Ricketts, T. Senior, Henderson, Carter, and\nWatkins, forwards; Wren (school captain) and Forrester (iv.),\nquarter-back; Greenfield and Bullinger, half-back; and Wraysford, back.\nWith a team like this the school ought to give a good account of itself\nagainst our visitors.\"\n\nThis announcement was interesting in more than one respect.  Greenfield\n_was_ in the team, Loman was _not_.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33. A STARTLING DISCOVERY.\n\nIt is now time to return to Loman, whom we left two chapters ago, with\nhis usual luck, standing in Greenfield's study with the 8 pounds in his\nhand which was finally to clear him of all his troubles, set him once\nfor all on his feet again, and take such a weight off his mind as ought\nto leave him the lightest-hearted boy in all Saint Dominic's.\n\nHe stood there for a minute or two after Oliver and Wraysford had left\nthe room, too bewildered to collect his thoughts or realise one-half of\nhis good fortune, for he had come to Oliver in his extremity as a\ndesperate chance, fully expecting an angry rebuff--or, at best, a\nchilling snub.  But to get through the interview like this, and find the\nmoney in his hand within three minutes of his entering the room--why, it\nquite took his breath away.\n\nOliver Greenfield _was_ a queer, unaccountable fellow, and no mistake!\n\nYet, strange to say, when Loman did come to himself he did not burst out\ninto a rapture of delight and gratitude.  On the contrary, he suddenly\nfelt himself growing to such a pitch of misery and low spirits as even\nin the worst of his troubles he had never experienced.  He repented\nbitterly of ever bringing himself to come and ask such a favour of his\nworst enemy, and, stranger than all, he felt his dislike for Greenfield\nincreased rather than swept away by this abrupt, startling piece of\ngenerosity.  Strange the whims that seize us!  Loman would almost have\nbeen happier in his old suspense about Cripps than to feel he owed such\na debt to such a creditor.\n\nHowever, the thought of Cripps, his other creditor, flashed suddenly\nthrough his mind at that moment, so, closing his hand over the money, he\nturned moodily and left the room.\n\nAt any rate, he would get clear of Cripps now he had the chance.\n\nAs soon as ever morning school was over he took his hat and traversed\nonce more the familiar road between Saint Dominic's and the Cockchafer.\n\"Is Cripps at home?\" he inquired of the potboy.\n\n\"Yas,\" said the boy.  \"Who wants him?\"\n\n\"I do, you young blockhead!\"\n\n\"You do?  Oh, all right!  I'll tell him, mister.  Don't you collar no\nmugs while I'm gone, mind!\"\n\nThe very potboys despised and ridiculed him!\n\nLoman waited patiently for a quarter of an hour, when the boy returned.\n\n\"Oh!\" said he, \"the governor can't see you, he says.  He's a-smoking his\npipe, he says, and he ain't a-goin' to put himself about, he says, for\nthe likes of you.  That's what he says!  Ti ridde tol rol ro!\" and here\nthe youth indulged in a spitefully cheerful carol as he resumed the\npolishing of the mugs.\n\n\"Look here!\" said Loman, miserable and half frightened, \"tell him I\n_must_ see him; I've got some money for him, tell him.\"\n\n\"No! have you?\" said the boy.  \"Well, wait till I've done this here\njob--I'm dead on this here job, I am!  You can keep, you can.\"\n\nThis was too much even for the dispirited and cowed Loman.  He caught\nthe impudent boy a box on the ear, which resounded all over the\nCockchafer, and sent him howling and yelling to his master.\n\nCripps appeared at last in a fury.  What, he demanded, with half a dozen\noaths, did Loman mean by coming there and assaulting him and his\nassistants?  \"What do you mean, you thieving jackanapes, you!  Get out\nof my shop, do you hear? or I'll get some one in who will help you out!\n_I'll_ teach you to come here and make yourself at home, you lying--\"\n\n\"Now, Cripps,\" began Loman.\n\n\"Hold your noise! do you hear?\" said Cripps, savagely.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Cripps,\" said the wretched boy; \"I didn't mean to hurt\nhim, but he--\"\n\n\"Oh! you won't go, won't you?  Very good! we'll see if we can make you;\"\nand Cripps departed from the bar, leaving his young \"patron\" in anything\nbut a comfortable frame of mind.\n\nFor once in a way, however, Loman was roused, and would not go.  The\nboy--miserable specimen as he was--had some courage in him, and when\nonce goaded up to the proper pitch it came out.  If he went, he argued\nto himself, Cripps would certainly come up to Saint Dominic's after him.\nIf he waited till the police or some of the roughs came and ejected him\nhe could not be much worse off; and there was a chance that, by\nremaining, he might still be able to pacify his evil genius.\n\nSo he stayed.  Another quarter of an hour passed; no one came to turn\nhim out.  A few customers came into the bar and were served by the sulky\npotboy, but there was no sign of Cripps.\n\n\"Go and tell your master I'm here still, and want to see him\nparticularly,\" said Loman, presently, to the boy.\n\nThe boy looked up and scowled and rubbed his ear, but somehow that\ntimely blow of Loman's had wrought wonders with his spirit, for he\nquietly went off and did as he was bid.\n\nIn a few minutes he came back and delivered the laconic message, \"You're\ngot to wait.\"\n\nThis was satisfactory as far as it went.  Loman did wait, simmering\ninwardly all the time, and not wholly losing his desperation before once\nagain Cripps appeared and beckoned him inside.\n\n\"Here's the rest of the money,\" said Loman, hurriedly.  \"You can give me\nback the bill now, Cripps.\"\n\nCripps took up the money, counted it and pocketed it, and then turned on\nhis victim with an impudent smile.\n\n\"Give me the bill,\" repeated Loman, suddenly turning pale with the\ndreadful misgiving that after all he had not got rid of the blackguard.\n\n\"What do you want the bill for?\" asked Cripps, laughing.\n\n\"Want it for?  Why, Cripps--\" and here Loman stopped short.\n\n\"Fire away,\" said Cripps.\n\n\"I've paid you all I owe,\" said Loman, trembling.\n\n\"What if you have?\"\n\n\"Then give me back that bill!\"\n\nCripps only laughed--a laugh which drove the boy frantic.  The villain\nwas going to play him false after all.  He had got the money, every\nfarthing of it, and now he was going to retain the bill which contained\nLoman's promise to pay the whole amount!  Poor Loman, he was no match in\ncunning for this rogue.  Who would believe him that he had paid, when\nCripps was still able to produce the promise signed with his own name to\ndo so?\n\nBitterly did the boy repent the day when first, by a yielding to deceit,\nhe had put himself in the power of such a villain!\n\nHe was too confounded and panic-struck to attempt either argument or\npersuasion.  He felt himself ruined, and muttering, in a voice which\ntrembled with misery, \"I must tell father all about it,\" he turned to\ngo.\n\nOh, Loman!  Why have you left such a resolve till now?  Why, like that\nother prodigal, have you waited till everything else has failed, till\nyour own resources and cunning have been exhausted to the last dregs,\nbefore you turn and say this!\n\nThe boy uttered the words involuntarily, not intending that they should\nbe heard.  Little he thought Cripps or any one would heed them.  But\nCripps did heed them.  His quick ear caught the words, and they _had_ a\nmeaning for him; for he might be able to cheat and browbeat and swindle\na boy, but when it came to dealing no longer with the boy, but with the\nboy's father, Cripps was sharp enough to know that was a very different\nmatter.  He had relied on the boy's fears of exposure and his dread of\nhis father's anger to carry his extortions to the utmost limit with\nconfidence.  But now he had gone a step too far.  When, in his\ndesperation, the boy naturally turned to the very being he had all along\nmost carefully kept ignorant of his proceedings, it was time for Cripps\nto pull up.\n\nHe stopped Loman as he was going away, with a laugh, as he said, in his\nold tones, \"Steady there, young gentleman, what a hurry you are in!  A\nman can't have a little bit of fun, just to see how you like it, but\nthere you go, and give it all up, and go and get yourself into a regular\nperspiration!  Tell the governor, indeed!  You don't suppose I'd let you\nget yourself into such a mess as all that, do you?  No, no.  You shall\nhave the bill, my man, never fear.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Cripps, thank you!\" cried Loman, in a sudden convulsion\nof gratitude and relief.\n\n\"'Pon my word, I might take offence, that I might, at your wanting the\npaper.  As if _I'd_ ever take advantage of a young gentleman like you!\nNo, no; honesty's the best policy for us poor folks as well as for you\nnobs.  No one can say I defrauded any one.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, of course not,\" cried Loman, enthusiastically.  \"I should like\nto see any one who did!\"\n\nMr Cripps, smiling sweetly and modestly, went to his cupboard, and\nafter a good deal of fumbling and search, produced the little slip of\nblue paper he was looking for.\n\n\"Is that it?\" cried the excited Loman.\n\n\"Looks like it,\" said Cripps, unfolding it and reading out, with his\nback to the boy, \"`Three months after date I promise to pay George\nCripps thirty-five pounds, value received.  Signed, E. Loman.'  That's\nabout it, eh, young gentleman?  Well, blessed if I ain't a soft-hearted\nchap after the doing you've given me over this here business.  Look\nhere; here goes.\"\n\nAnd so saying, Mr Cripps first tore the paper up into little bits, and\nthen threw the whole into the fire before the eyes of the delighted\nLoman.\n\n\"Thanks, Cripps, thanks,\" said the boy.  \"I am so glad everything's\nsettled now, and I am so sorry to have kept you waiting so long.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, as long as it's been an obligement to you, I don't so much\ncare,\" said the virtuous Cripps.  \"And now you've done with me I suppose\nyou'll cut me dead, eh, young gentleman?  Just the way.  You stick to us\nas long as you can get anything out of us, and then we're nobodies.\"\n\nAnd here Mr Cripps looked very dejected.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Loman, \"I don't mean to cut you, Cripps.  I shall come\ndown now and then--really I will--when I can manage it.  Good-bye now.\"\n\nAnd he held out his hand.\n\nFoolish and wicked as Loman was, there was still left in him some of\nthat boyish generosity which makes one ready to forget injuries and\nquick to acknowledge a good turn.  Loman forgot for a moment all the\nhideous past, with its suspense and humiliations and miseries, and\nremembered only that Cripps had torn up the bill and allowed him to\nclear off accounts once for all at the hated Cockchafer.  Alas! he had\nforgotten, too, about telling all to his father!\n\n\"Good-day, young gentleman,\" said Cripps, with a pensive face which made\nthe boy quite sorry to see.\n\nHe shook hands cordially and gratefully, and departed lighter in heart\nthan he had felt for some time.\n\nBut as he returned to Saint Dominic's the thought of Oliver, and of his\ndebt to him, returned, and turned again all his satisfaction into\nvexation.  He wished he had the money that moment to fling back into the\nfellow's face!\n\nI don't pretend to explain this whim of Loman's.  It may have been his\nconscience which prompted it.  For a mean person nearly always detests\nan honest one, and the more open and generous the one is, the meaner the\nother feels in his own heart by contrast.\n\nHowever, for some days Loman had not the painful reminder of his debt\noften before his eyes; for as long as the Doctor was absent Oliver\nremained in the Fifth.\n\nAt length, however, the head master returned, restored and well, and\nimmediately the \"removes\" were put into force, and Oliver and Wraysford\nfound themselves duly installed on the lowest bench of the Sixth--the\nonly other occupant of which was Loman.  The two friends, however, held\nvery little intercourse with their new class-fellow, and Oliver never\nonce referred to the eight pounds; and, like every one and everything\nelse, Loman grew accustomed to the idea of being his rival's debtor,\nand, as the days went on, ceased to be greatly troubled by the fact at\nall.\n\nBut an event happened one day, shortly after the Doctor's return, which\ngave every one something else to think about besides loans and debtors.\n\nIt was the morning of the day fixed for the great football match against\nthe County, and every one, even the Sixth and Fifth, chafed somewhat at\nthe two hours appointed on such a day for so mundane an occupation as\nlessons.\n\nWho could think of lessons when any minute the County men might turn up?\nWho could be bothered with dactyls and spondees when goal-posts and\ntouch-lines were far more to the point?  And who could be expected to\nfix his mind on hexameters and elegiacs when the height of human\nperfection lay in a straight drop-kick or a fast double past the enemy's\nhalf-backs?  However, the Doctor had made up his mind Latin verses\nshould get their share of attention that morning, and the two head forms\nwere compelled to submit as best they could.\n\nNow, on this occasion, the Doctor was specially interested in the\nsubject in hand, and waxed more than usually eloquent over the\ncomparative beauties of Horace and Virgil and Ovid, and went into the\nminutest details about their metres.  Over one line which contained what\nseemed to be a false quantity he really became excited.\n\n\"It is a most remarkable thing, and I am really pleased we have fallen\non the passage,\" said he, \"that this identical mistake, if it is a\nmistake, occurs in a line of Juvenal; it is in the--dear me, I have\nforgotten how it begins!  Has any one here a Juvenal?\"\n\n\"I have one in my study, sir,\" said Loman.  (Juvenal had been one of the\nLatin subjects for the Nightingale.)\n\n\"Ah!  Would you fetch it, Loman, please?  I think I know precisely where\nthe line occurs.\"\n\nLoman rose and went for the book, which he found upon his bookcase,\nenjoying a dignified and dusty repose on the top shelf.  Carefully\nbrushing off the dust, so as to give the volume a rather less unused\nlook, he returned with it to the class-room, and handed it to the\nDoctor.\n\n\"Thank you, Loman.  Now, it is in the Fourth--no, the Fifth Satire,\"\nsaid he, turning over the pages.  \"Let me see--yes, not far from--ah!\"\n\nThis last exclamation was uttered in a voice which made every boy in the\nroom look suddenly up and fix his eyes on the Doctor.  It was evidently\nsomething more than an exclamation of recognition on finding the desired\npassage.  There was too much surprise and too much pain in the word for\nthat.\n\nWas the Doctor ill?  He closed the book and sat back in his chair in a\nsort of bewilderment.  Then suddenly, and with an evident effort,\nrecovering himself, he let his eyes once more rest on the closed\nJuvenal.\n\n\"Loman,\" he said, \"will you come and find the passage for me?  Turn to\nthe Fifth Satire.\"\n\nLoman obeyed, much wondering, notwithstanding, why the Doctor should ask\nhim, of all people, to come up and turn to the passage.\n\nHe advanced to the head master's desk and took up the Juvenal.\n\n\"The Fifth Satire,\" repeated the Doctor, keeping his eyes on the book.\n\nCertainly the Doctor was very queer this morning.  One would suppose his\nlife depended on the discovery of that unlucky line, so keenly he\nwatched Loman as he turned over the pages.\n\nWas the book bewitched?  Loman, as he held it, suddenly turned deadly\nwhite, and closed it quickly, as if between the leaves there lay a\nscorpion!  Then again, seeing the Doctor's eye fixed on him, he opened\nit, and, with faltering voice, began to read the line.\n\n\"That will do.  Hand me the book, Loman.\"\n\nThe Doctor's voice, as he uttered these words, was strangely solemn.\n\nLoman hurriedly took a paper from between the leaves and handed the book\nto the Doctor.\n\n\"Hand me that paper, Loman!\"\n\nLoman hesitated.\n\n\"Obey me, Loman!\"\n\nLoman looked once at the Doctor, and once at the Juvenal; then, with a\ngroan, he flung the paper down on to the desk.\n\nThe Doctor took it up.\n\n\"This paper,\" said he, slowly, and in an agitated voice--\"this paper is\nthe missing paper of questions for the Nightingale Scholarship last\nterm.  Loman, remain here, please.  The other boys may go.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34. THE MATCH AGAINST THE COUNTY.\n\nThe boys, astounded and bewildered by this unexpected revelation, slowly\nrose to obey the Doctor's order, leaving Loman alone with the head\nmaster.\n\nThe boy was ashy pale as Dr Senior turned to him and said, solemnly--\n\n\"How do you account for this, Loman?\"\n\nLoman lowered his eyes and made no reply.\n\n\"Answer me please, Loman.  Can you account for this?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see this paper before?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know how it came into your Juvenal?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you know anything at all about the lost paper?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe Doctor looked long and searchingly at him as he said once more--\n\n\"Loman, are you sure you are telling me the truth?  You know nothing\nwhatever about the paper--never saw it before this moment?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You knew the paper had been missed off my desk?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Had you the least reason for believing any boy took it?\"\n\nLoman hesitated.\n\n\"I would rather not say,\" he said at last.\n\n\"You must please answer me frankly, Loman.  Had you any reason, I ask,\nfor believing any boy took the paper?\"\n\n\"Must I say?\" asked Loman.\n\n\"Yes--you must.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I did fancy some one had taken it.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Greenfield senior,\" said Loman, flushing quickly as he said the name.\n\n\"And what made you suspect Greenfield senior?\"\n\n\"All the boys suspected him.\"\n\n\"That is not an answer, Loman.  Why?\"\n\n\"Because, for one thing,\" said Loman, sullenly, \"he was seen coming out\nof your study that evening.\"\n\n\"And why else?\"\n\n\"Because he came out so high in the exam.\"\n\n\"And for these reasons you suspected Greenfield of taking the paper?\nWhy did you not mention the matter to me?\"\n\nLoman did his best to look virtuous.\n\n\"I did not wish to get any one into trouble.\"\n\n\"And you preferred to let an affair like this go on without taking any\nsteps to have it cleared up?  Did Greenfield deny the charge?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did he admit it?\"\n\n\"Very nearly.  He wouldn't speak to any one for months.\"\n\n\"And you really believe that Greenfield took the paper?\"\n\nLoman looked up at the Doctor for a moment and answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you lend him your Juvenal at any time?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose he put the paper in the book?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say; but I don't see who else could.\"\n\n\"That will do, Loman; you can go.  Kindly leave the paper and the\nJuvenal with me.\"\n\nLoman turned to go, but the Doctor stopped him with one more question.\n\n\"You know, I suppose, that the questions which you actually had set for\nthe Nightingale examination were quite different from those on the\npaper?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Loman.  \"I mean--that is,\" he added, stammering, and taking\nup the paper in question.  \"I see by this paper they were quite\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"Yes; you can go now, Loman.\"\n\nThere was something so solemn and hard in the head master's voice as he\ndismissed the boy that Loman felt very uncomfortable as he slowly\ndeparted to his own study.\n\n_He_, at any rate, was in no humour for enjoying the big football match\nwhich was just beginning.\n\nAnd it must be confessed the event of the morning had had the effect of\ndisconcerting a good many more than himself.  Stansfield had quite hard\nwork going round among his troops and rousing them once more to the\nproper pitch of enthusiasm.\n\n\"What--whatever does it matter,\" he said, \"if the fellow did take it?\n_You_ didn't take it, Winter, or you, Wren; and what on earth's the use\nof getting down in the mouth, and perhaps losing the match, because of\nit?  We're always having our football spoiled by something or other,\" he\nadded with a groan.  \"I'll tell you what it is, let's only lick these\nfellows this afternoon, and then I'll howl and groan and do anything you\nlike, for a week.\"\n\nThere was no resisting such a generous offer.  The fellows made up their\nminds to forget everything else that afternoon but the County, and so to\nplay that the County should have some difficulty in soon forgetting\nthem.\n\n\"Fire away, you fellows, and peel!\" cried Stansfield, as Oliver and\nWraysford sauntered past.\n\nThey fired away.  But while dressing they exchanged a few words on the\nforbidden subject.\n\n\"Did you ever expect it would be brought home to Loman like this, Noll?\"\nasked Wray.\n\n\"No, I didn't.  And yet in a way--\"\n\n\"Eh?  What do you say?\"\n\n\"Why, Wray, you remember me saying that evening, after I left the study,\nthe only fellow I met in the passage besides Simon was Loman?\"\n\n\"Yes; so you did.\"\n\n\"He was going towards the Doctor's study,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Hum!  I remember now you said so.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" continued Oliver, plunging into his jersey--\"and yet I can't\nsee how, if he did take the paper, he didn't do better in the exam.  He\ncame out so very low.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's queer, unless he took a fit of repentance all of a sudden,\nand didn't look at it.\"\n\n\"Then it's queer he didn't destroy it, instead of sticking it in his\nJuvenal.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose the Doctor will clear it up, now he's on the scent.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Oliver; \"but, I say, old man,\" he added, \"of course\nthere's no need for us to say anything about it to anybody.  The poor\nbeggar doesn't want _our_ help to get him into trouble.\"\n\n\"No, indeed.  I'd be as glad, quite, if it were found to be another\nwrong scent, after all,\" said Wraysford.  \"The fellow's in a bad enough\nway as it is.\"\n\n\"Are you nearly ready, you two?\" thundered Stansfield at the door.\n\n\"Just ready!\" they exclaimed; and in another minute they, too, had\ndismissed from their minds everything but Saint Dominic's versus County,\nas they trotted off to join the rest of their comrades on the field of\nbattle.\n\nAnd, indeed, for the next two hours there was no opportunity, even, had\nthey desired it, for any one to think of anything but this momentous\nstruggle.\n\nFor three years running the County had beaten the schoolboys, each time\nworse than before, until at last the latter had got to be afraid the\nothers would begin to think them foemen not worthy of their steel.  This\nyear they hardly dared hope a better fate than before, for the enemy\nwere down in force.  Yet the boys had determined to die hard, and at\nleast give their adversaries all the trouble they could before their\ngoal should fall; and of this they were all the more sanguine, because\ntheir team was the very best the school could muster, and not a man\namong them but knew his business, and could be depended on to do it too.\n\nBad luck!  Of course, just when it's not wanted there's a breeze got up,\nblowing right down the field, and in the very teeth of the schoolboys,\nwho have lost the toss, and have to play from the oak-tree end for the\nfirst half of the game!\n\n\"It's always the way,\" growls Ricketts.  \"They'll simply eat us up while\nthey've got the chance, you see!\"\n\n\"No they won't,\" says Stansfield, bound to take a cheerful view of\nthings.  \"We're strong in backs.  It's not like last match, when\nGreenfield wasn't playing, and Loman was there to make such a mess of\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a comfort, that, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" says the captain.  \"What you fellows have got to do\nis to keep the ball in close, and nurse it along all the while, or else\nrun--but you'd better let the quarter-backs do that.\"\n\nThis sage advice is not thrown away on the worthies who lead the van for\nSaint Dominic's, and an opportunity for putting it into practice occurs\nthe moment the game begins.  For the School has to kick-off, and to\nkick-off against that wind is a hopeless business.  Stansfield does not\nattempt anything like a big kick, but just drives the ball hard and low\non to the legs of the County forwards, sending his own men close after\nit, so that a scrimmage is formed almost at the very spot where the ball\ngrounds.\n\n\"Now, School, sit on it!  Do you hear?\" calls out the captain; and\ncertainly it looks as if that unhappy ball were never destined to see\nthe light again.  The enemy's forwards cannot get it out from among the\nfeet of the School forwards, try all they will, until, by sheer weight,\nthey simply force it through.  And then, when it does go through, there\nis young Forrester of the Fourth ready for it, and next moment it is\nback in its old place in the middle of the \"mush.\"  In due time, out it\ncomes again--this time on Wren's side--and once again, after a short\nrun, there it is again, on almost the identical spot of earth where it\nhas undergone its last two poundings.\n\n\"Played up, Dominies!\" cries out Stansfield, cheerily.  \"Stick to it\nnow!\"\n\nStick to it they do, with the wind fresh on their faces, and the County\nfellows charging and plunging and shoving like fury upon them.\n\nAh! there goes the ball, out at the County end for a wonder.  The\nspectators cheer loudly for the schoolboys.  Little they know!  It had\nmuch better have stayed there among their feet than roll out into the\nopen.  The County quarter-back has it in his hands in a twinkling, and\nin another twinkling he has lifted it with a drop-kick high into the\nair, all along the wind, which carries it, amid cheers and shouts, right\nup to the boundary of the School goal.\n\nSo much for cutting through the scrimmage!\n\nWraysford, the Dominican \"back,\" is ready for it when it drops, and,\nwithout touching-down, runs out with it.  He is a cautious fellow, is\nWraysford, and does not often try this game.  But the ball has far\noutstripped the enemy's forwards, and so he has a pretty open field.\nBut not for long.  In a _few_ seconds the County is upon him, and he and\nthe ball are no longer visible.  Then follow a lot more scrimmages, with\nsimilar results.  It is awfully slow for the spectators, but Stansfield\nrejoices over it, and the County men chafe.\n\n\"Can't you let it out there?  Play looser, and let it through,\" says\ntheir captain.\n\nLoose it is.\n\n\"That's better!\" says the County captain, as presently the ball comes\nout with a bound full into the quarter-back's hands, who holds it, and,\nto the horror of the boys, makes his mark before he can be collared.\n\nThe scrimmage has been near up to the Dominican goal--within a kick--and\nnow, as the schoolboys look round first at the goal and then at the\nCounty man with the ball, the distance looks painfully small.  And even\nif it were greater, this wind would do the business.\n\nThe County man takes plenty of room back from his mark, up to which the\nSchool forwards stand ready for one desperate rush the moment the ball\ntouches the ground.  Alas, it is no go!  They have a knowing hand and a\nquick foot to deal with.  Before they can cover the few yards which\ndivide them, the ball is dropped beautifully, and flies, straight as an\narrow, over the cross-bar, amid the tremendous cheers of the County men\nand their friends.\n\n\"Never mind!\" says Stansfield, as his men walk out once more to the\nfray, \"they shan't get another before half-time!\"\n\nWon't they?  Such is the perversity of that creature people call Luck,\nand such is the hatred it has for anything like a boast, that two\nminutes--only two minutes--after the words are out of the captain's\nmouth another Dominican goal has fallen.\n\nFor Stansfield in kicking off gets his foot too much under the ball,\nwhich consequently rises against the wind and presents an easy catch to\nany one who comes out to take it.  A County forward sees his chance.\nRushing up, he catches the ball, and instantaneously, so it seems,\ndrop-kicks it, a tremendous kick clean over the School goal, before even\nthe players have all taken up their places after the last catastrophe.\n\nThis is dreadful! worse than ever!  Never in their worst days had such a\nthing happened.  For once in a way Stansfield's hopefulness deserts him,\nand he feels the School is in for an out-and-out hiding.\n\nThe captain would like extremely to blow some one up, if he only knew\nwhom.  It is so aggravating sometimes to have no one to blow-up.\nNothing relieves the feelings so, does it?\n\nHowever, Stansfield has to bottle up his feelings, and, behold! once\nmore he and his men are in battle array.\n\nThis time it's steady all again, and the ball is kept well out of sight.\nIt can't even slip out behind now, as before; for the School\nquarter-backs are up to that dodge, and ready to pounce upon it before\nit can be lifted or sent flying.  Indeed, the only chance the wretched\nball has of seeing daylight is--\n\nHullo! half-time!\n\nThe announcement falls on joyful ears among the Dominicans.  They have\nworked hard and patiently against heavy odds; and they feel they really\ndeserve this respite.\n\nNow, at last, if the wind wouldn't change for them, they have changed\nover to the wind, which blows no longer in their faces, but gratefully\non to their backs.\n\nThe kick-off is a positive luxury under such circumstances; Stansfield\nneedn't be afraid of skying the ball now, and he isn't.  It shoots up\nwith a prodigious swoop and soars right away to touch-line, so that the\nCounty's \"back\" is the first of their men to go into action.  He brings\nthe ball back deftly and prettily, slipping in and out among his own\nmen, who get beside him as a sort of bodyguard, ready at any moment to\ncarry on the ball.  It is ludicrous to see Ricketts and Winter and\nCallonby flounder about after him.  The fellow is like an eel.  One\nmoment you have him, the next he's away; now you're sure of him, now\nhe's out of all reach.  Ah!  Stansfield's got him at last!  No he\nhasn't; but Winter has--No, Winter has lost him; and--just look--he's\npast all the School forwards, no one can say how.\n\nYoung Forrester tackles him gamely--but young Forrester is no hand at\neel-catching; in fact, the eel catches Forrester, and leaves him\ngracefully on his back.  Past the quarter-backs!  The man has a charmed\nlife!\n\nAh!  Greenfield has got him at last.  Yes, Mr Eel, you may wriggle as\nhard as you like, but you'd hardly find your way out of that grip\nwithout leave!\n\nAltogether this is a fine run, and makes the School see that even with\nthe wind they are not going to have it all their own way.  However, they\nwarm up wonderfully after this.\n\nSteady is still the word (what grand play we should get if it were\nalways the word at football, you schoolboys!  You may kick and run and\nscrimmage splendidly, but you are not steady--but this is digression).\nSteady is still the word, and _every_ minute Saint Dominic's pulls\nbetter together.  The forwards work like one man, and, lighter weight\nthough they are, command the scrimmages by reason of their good\n\"packing.\"\n\nWren and young Forrester, the quarter-backs, are \"dead on\" the ball the\nmoment it peeps out from the scrimmage; and behind them at half-back\nOliver and Bullinger are not missing a chance.  If they did, Wraysford\nis behind them, a prince of \"backs.\"\n\nOh, for a chance to put this fine machinery into motion!  Time is\nflying, and the umpire is already fidgeting with his watch.  Oh, for one\nchance!  And while we speak here it comes.  A County man has just darted\nup along the touch-line half the length of the field.  Wren goes out to\nmeet him, and behind Wren--too close behind--advances Oliver.  The\nCounty man thinks twice before delivering himself up into the clutches\nof one of these heroes, and ends his run with a kick, which, Oliver\nbeing not in his place, Wraysford runs forward to take.  Now Wraysford\nhas hardly had a run this afternoon.  He means to have one now!  And he\ndoes have one.  He takes the ball flying, gives one hurried look round,\nand then makes right for the thick of the fray.  Who backs him up?\nGreenfield for one, and all the rest of Saint Dominic's for the other.\n\n\"Stick close!\" he says to Oliver, as he flies past.  Oliver wants no\nbidding.  He follows his man like a shadow.  In and out among the\nforwards, and round about past the quarter-backs; and when at last\nWraysford is borne down by a combined force of half and\nthree-quarter-backs, Greenfield is there to take the ball on.\n\n\"Look-out there!\" cries the County captain, \"mark that man.\"  The County\ndoes mark that man, and they have the painful task of marking him pass\none half-back and floor another before he is arrested.\n\n\"I'm here!\" cries Wraysford's voice at that moment; and next instant the\nball is again hurrying on towards the County goal in Wraysford's arms,\nGreenfield once more being in close attendance.\n\nAnd now the County backs come into action, and the first of them collars\nWraysford.  But it is Oliver who collars the ball, and amid the shouts,\nand howls, and cheers of players and spectators rushes it still onward.\nThe second \"back\" is the County's only remaining hope, nor surely will\nhe fail.  He rushes at Oliver.  Oliver rushes at him.  Wraysford, once\nmore on his feet, rushes on them both.\n\n\"Look-out for the ball there!\" is the panic cry of the County.  Ay, look\nindeed!  Oliver is down, but Wraysford has it, and walks with it merrily\nover the County's goal-line, and deposits it on the ground in the exact\ncentre of the posts.\n\n\"There never was such a rush-up, or such a pretty piece of double play,\"\nsay the knowing ones among the onlookers; and when a minute later the\nball is brought out, and Stansfield kicks it beautifully over the goal,\nevery one says that it is one of the best-earned goals that old meadow\nhas ever seen kicked, and that Saint Dominic's, though beaten, has\nnothing in that day's performance to be ashamed of.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35. A VOCAL, INSTRUMENTAL, AND DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT IN THE FOURTH JUNIOR.\n\nNow among those who were present to witness the famous \"rush-up\" of\nGreenfield senior and Wraysford, which ended in the fall of the County\ngoal, was one boy who showed very little enthusiasm over the\nachievement, or very little delight at the glory which the school\nthereby derived.\n\nLoman, who, unable to sit in his study, and not knowing what else to do,\nhad wandered almost instinctively to the meadow, found himself on this\nparticular afternoon one of the most miserable boys in Saint Dominic's.\n\nTwo years ago, when he first entered the school, he was popular with his\nfellows and voted an acquisition on the cricket-ground and\nfootball-field whenever the youth of Saint Dominic's strove in emulation\nagainst their rivals.  He could remember a time when fellows strolled\narm-in-arm with him down to the matches; when the small boys looked\nquite meek in his presence, and the masters gave a friendly nod in\nanswer to his salutes.  That was when he was quite new at Saint\nDominic's; but how changed now!  This afternoon, for instance, as he\nstood looking on, he had the cheerful knowledge that not a boy in all\nthat assembly cared two straws about him.  Why wasn't _he_ playing in\nthe match?  Why did the fellows, as they came near him, look straight in\nfront of them, or go round to avoid him?  Why did the Guinea-pigs and\nTadpoles strut about and crack their vulgar jokes right under his very\nnose, as if he was nobody?  Alas, Loman! something's been wrong with you\nfor the last year or thereabouts; and if we don't all know the cause, we\ncan see the effect.  For it is a fact, you _are_ nobody in the eyes of\nSaint Dominic's at the present time.\n\nHowever, he was destined to become a somebody pretty soon; and, indeed,\nas soon as the football match was over, and the supper after it was\ndisposed of, and the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles (who, you know, had\nselected this same afternoon _for their_ great football match) had\nceased their rows in slumber, every one's mind, at least the mind of\nevery one in the two head forms, turned naturally to the strange and\nmysterious event of the morning.  What various conclusions they came to\nit is not for me to set down here.  They probably came to as good a\nconclusion as the reader has done, and waited impatiently to have the\nwhole thing cleared up.\n\nAnd it looked as if the Doctor were about to do this next morning, for\nhe summoned together the Fifth and Sixth, and thus solemnly addressed\nthem:--\n\n\"Before we begin the lesson for the day, boys, I wish to refer to an\nincident that happened here yesterday morning, which must be fresh in\nyour memories.  I mean the accidental discovery of the lost examination\npaper for the Nightingale Scholarship.  I hope you will not draw hasty\nconclusions from what then occurred.  The boy in whose book the paper\nwas found is present here, and has assured me on his honour he never saw\nthe paper before, and is quite ignorant how it came into his book.  That\nis so, Loman?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Loman.\n\n\"When a boy makes a statement to me on his honour, I accept it as such,\"\nsaid the Doctor, very gravely, and looking hard at the boy.  \"I accept\nit as such--\"\n\nLoman sat motionless with his eyes on the desk before him.\n\n\"But,\" went on the Doctor, turning again to the boys, \"before I dismiss\nthe subject I must do justice to one among you who I find, much to my\npain, has been an object of suspicion in connection with this same lost\npaper.  Greenfield senior, I have no hesitation in saying, is perfectly\nclear of any such imputation as that you put upon him.  I may say in his\npresence I believe him to be incapable of a fraudulent and mean act; and\nfurther than that, you boys will be interested to hear that the\nquestions which he answered so brilliantly in that examination were not\nthe questions which appeared on the lost paper at all, but an entirely\nnew set, which for my own satisfaction I drew up on the morning of\nexamination itself.\"\n\nThis announcement _did_ interest every one--the Fifth particularly, who\nfelt their own humiliation now fourfold as they looked at Oliver, and\nthought of what their conduct to him had been.\n\nIt interested Oliver and Wraysford as much as any one, but for a\ndifferent reason.  Supposing Loman had taken the paper--this was the\nreflection which darted through both their minds--supposing Loman _had_\ntaken the paper and worked up the answers from it, might not the sudden\nchange of questions described by the Doctor account for the low place he\nhad taken in the exam?\n\nAltogether the Doctor's speech left things (except as concerned Oliver)\nnot much more satisfactory than before.  The natural impulse of\neverybody was to suspect Loman.  But, then, six months ago the natural\nimpulse had been equally as strong to suspect Oliver, and--well, that\nhad somehow turned out a bad \"spec,\" and so might this.\n\nSo Saint Dominic's really didn't know what to think, and settled down to\nthe work of the term in an uneasy frame of mind, wishing something would\nturn up, to end the wretched affair of the lost paper definitely one way\nor another.\n\nOf course the report of the new state of affairs soon penetrated down to\nthe lower school, and the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles at any rate were not\nslow in making up _their_ minds on the burning question.\n\nThey turned out in a body and hooted Loman up and down the passages with\nas much, if not more, glee than some of them had lately hooted Oliver.\n\"Yah, boo!  Who stole the exam paper?--there! old Loman.\"  Such were the\ncries which presently became familiar in the school, until one day Mr\nRastle dropped down on some twenty of the \"howlers,\" and set them each\ntwelve propositions of Euclid to learn by heart, and two hours a-piece\nin the detention-room, there to meditate over their evil ways.\n\nThe quiet of the lower school during the next week was something\ndelicious.\n\nThe tyrannical proceeding on the part of Mr Rastle provoked bitter\nindignation, of course, in the breasts of the culprits.  Why weren't\nthey to be allowed to express their feelings?  And if Rastle did want to\n\"pot\" them, why should he give them Euclid to learn, when he knew\nperfectly well Euclid was the very thing not one of them _could_ learn\nby heart?  And if he did want to detain them, why _ever_ should he fix\non the identical week in which the grand \"Vocal, Instrumental, and\nDramatic Entertainment\" of the Fourth Junior was due to come off.\n\nIt was an abominable piece of spite, that was a fact; and Mr Rastle was\nsolemnly condemned one evening in the dormitory to be blown up with\ndynamite at the first convenient opportunity.  Meanwhile, come what\nwould, the \"Vocal, Instrumental, and Dramatic Entertainment\" _should_\ncome off, if it cost every man Jack of the \"entertainers\" his head.\n\nStephen, who by this time was a person of authority in his class, was\nappointed president of the \"V. I. and D. Society.\"  The manner of his\nelection to this honourable office had been peculiar, but emphatic.  He\nhad been proposed by Paul and seconded by himself in a short but elegant\nspeech, in which he asserted he would only serve if his appointment was\nunanimous.  It _was_ unanimous, for directly after this magnanimous\nstatement he and Paul and a few others proceeded summarily to eject\nBramble, Padger, and others who showed signs of opposition; and then,\nlocking the door, proceeded to an immediate vote, which, amid loud\nGuinea-pig cheers, was declared to be unanimous, one contumacious\nTadpole, who had escaped notice, having his hands held down by his sides\nduring the ceremony.  As soon as the doors were open, Bramble, who had\nmeanwhile collected a large muster of adherents, rushed in, and, turning\nout all the Guinea-pigs, had himself elected treasurer, and Padger\nhonorary secretary.  These exciting appointments having been made, the\nmeeting was \"thrown open,\" a programme was drawn up, and the\npreparations were in a very forward state when the sad interruption\noccasioned by Mr Rastle's brutal conduct took place.  But if Mr Rastle\nthought he was going to extinguish the \"Vocal, Instrumental, and\nDramatic Entertainment\" he was woefully mistaken.\n\nAs soon as ever, by superhuman exertions, Bramble and a few others of\nthe \"potted\" ones had struggled through their Euclid, and served their\nterm of detention, an evening was fixed upon for the great event to come\noff.\n\nImmediately a question arose.  Should the public be admitted?\n\n\"Rather!\" exclaimed Bramble, the treasurer, \"five bob each.\"\n\n\"Masters half price,\" suggested Padger.\n\n\"Greenfield senior free!\" shouted the loyal Paul.\n\n\"Bah! do you think Greenfield senior would come to hear you spout, you\nyoung muff!\" roared the amiable Bramble.\n\n\"I know what he would come for,\" retorted Paul, \"and I'd come with him\ntoo.  Guess!\"\n\n\"Shan't guess.  Shall I, Padger?\"\n\n\"May as well,\" suggested Padger.\n\n\"He'd come,\" cried Paul, not waiting for the Tadpole to guess--\"he'd\ncome a mile to see you hung.  So would I--there!\"\n\nIt was some time before the meeting got back to the subject of admitting\nthe public.  But it was finally agreed that, though the public were not\nto be invited, the door should be left open, and any one (\"presenting\nhis card,\" young Bilbury suggested) might come in, with the exception of\nLoman, Mr Rastle, Tom Braddy, and the school cat.\n\nFor the next few days the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were busy, learning\ntheir parts, practising their songs, arranging all the details of their\ndramatic performance, and so on; and Mr Rastle had to \"pot\" one or two\nmore of them, and detain one or two others, before he could get anything\nlike the ordinary work of the class done.  All this the young vocal,\ninstrumental, and dramatic enthusiasts bore patiently, devoting so many\nextra ounces of dynamite to Mr Rastle's promised blow-up for each\noffence.\n\nAt last the festival day arrived.  Stephen, on whom, somehow, all the\nwork had devolved, while the talking and discussion of knotty points had\nfallen on his two brother officers, looked quite pale and anxious on the\neventful morning.\n\n\"Well, young 'un,\" said Oliver, \"I suppose Wray and I are to be allowed\nto come and see the fun to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Stephen, with considerable misgivings about the \"fun.\"\n\n\"All serene; we'll be there, won't we, Wray?  Not the first Guinea-pig\nkick-up we've been witness to, either.\"\n\n\"Do you think Pembury will come?\" asked Stephen, nervously.\n\n\"Oh, rather.  He'll have to report it in the next _Dominican_.  I'll see\nhe comes.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think he needn't mind,\" said Stephen, with a queer shyness; \"I\ncould write out a report for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say; a nice report that would be.  No, Tony must be there.\nHe wouldn't miss it for a five-pound note.\"\n\nStephen retired to report these rather alarming prospects of an audience\nto his comrades.\n\n\"Talking of five-pound notes,\" said Wraysford, after he had gone, \"does\nLoman ever mean to pay up that 8 pounds?\"\n\n\"I don't know; it doesn't look like it,\" said Oliver.  \"The fact is, he\ncame to me yesterday to borrow another pound for something or another.\nHe said Cripps had been up to the school and tried to make out that\nthere was another owing, and had threatened, unless he got it, at once\nto speak to the head master.\"\n\n\"Did you lend it him?\" said Wraysford.  \"It's a regular swindle.\"\n\n\"I hadn't got it to lend.  I told him I was sure the fellow was a thief,\nand advised him to tell the Doctor.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Oh, he got in an awful state, and said he would get into no end of a\nrow, and wouldn't for the world have the Doctor know a word of it.\"\n\n\"I don't like it at all,\" said Wraysford.  \"Don't you have more to do\nthan you can help with that business, Noll, old man.\"\n\n\"But the poor beggar seems regularly at his wits' end.\"\n\n\"Never mind; you'll do him and yourself no good by lending him money.\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't done so, for a very good reason, as I tell you.  But\nI'm sorry for him.  I do believe he can't see that he's being fleeced.\nHe made me promise not to utter a word of it to the Doctor, so I really\ndon't know how to help him.\"\n\n\"It's my impression he's good reason to be afraid of the Doctor just\nnow,\" said Wraysford.  \"That Nightingale business has yet to be cleared\nup.\"\n\nThe two friends pursued this disagreeable topic no farther, but agreed,\nfor all Loman wasn't a nice boy, and for all they had neither of them\nmuch cause to love him, they would see the next day if they could not do\nsomething to help him in his difficulty.  Meanwhile they gave themselves\nover to the pure and refined enjoyment of the \"Vocal, Instrumental, and\nDramatic Entertainment.\"\n\nAt seven that evening, after tea, the Fourth Junior room became a centre\nof attraction to all Saint Dominic's.  Fellows from the Sixth and Fifth,\nalways ready for novelty in the way of amusement, looked in to see the\nsport.  The Fourth Senior grandly condescended to witness the vulgar\nexploits of their juniors, and the other classes were most of them\nrepresented by one or more spectators.\n\nThe programme had been carefully got up.  Stephen took the chair\nsolemnly at the appointed hour, and with a great deal of stammering\nannounced that the proceedings were now about to commence, and then sat\ndown.  An awful pause ensued.  At first it was borne with interest, then\nwith impatience; then, when Stephen began to whisper to Paul, and Paul\nbegan to signal to Bramble, and Bramble gesticulated in dumb show at\nPadger, and all four whispered together, and finally looked very gravely\nin an opposite direction to the audience, then they began to be amused.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Stephen, very red, turning round abruptly after this awkward\npause had continued for a minute or two--\"oh, that was wrong; he doesn't\nbegin, and the other fellow's away.  Look here, Bramble, do your thing\nnow.\"\n\n\"No, I can't,\" whispered Bramble in an audible voice.  \"I've forgotten\nthe first line.\"\n\n\"Something about a kid asleep,\" suggested Padger, also audibly.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bramble, starting up and blushing very red as he began.\n\n\"`Lines on Seeing my Wife and Two Children Asleep'--Hood.\"\n\nThis modest announcement of his subject was overwhelming in itself, and\nwas greeted with such yells of laughter that the poor elocutionist found\nit utterly impossible to go on.  He tried once or twice, but never got\nbeyond the first half line.\n\n\"And has the earth--\" and here he stuck, but in answer to the cheers\nbegan again, looking round for Padger to help.\n\n\"And has the earth--(Go it, Padger, give a fellow a leg up, can't you?)\"\n\n\"I can't find the place,\" said Padger, very hot and flurried, and\nwhipping over the pages of a book with his moist thumb.\n\n\"And has the earth--(Look in the index, you lout!  Oh, won't I give it\nto you afterwards!)\" once more began the wretched Bramble.  He got no\nfarther.  Even had he remembered the words his voice could never have\nrisen above the laughter, which continued as long as he remained on his\nfeet.\n\nHe retired at length in dudgeon, and Stephen called on Paul for a song.\nThis went off better, only everybody stamped the time with his feet, so\nthat the singer could neither be heard for the row nor seen for the\ndust.  After that followed another \"reading.\"  This time the subject was\na humorous one--\"Ben Battle,\" by T. Hood.  Every one, by the way, chose\nHood.  It was the only poetry-book to be had in the Fourth Junior.  The\nreading progressed satisfactorily for the first two lines--indeed, until\na joke occurred, and here the reader was so overcome with the humour of\nthe thing that he broke into a laugh, and every time he tried to begin\nthe next line he laughed before he could get it out, until at last it\ngot to be quite as monotonous as watching the hyena at the Zoological\nGardens.  Finally he did get through the line, but in a voice so weak,\nwavering by reason of his efforts not to laugh, that the effect was more\nludicrous than ever.  He could get no farther, however.  For the\nrecollection of the joke that had passed, and the anticipation of the\none that was coming, fairly doubled him up, and he let the book drop out\nof his hands in the middle of one of his convulsions.\n\nThe next performance was an \"instrumental\" one, which bade fair to be a\ngreat success.  Four of the boys had learned to whistle \"Home, Sweet\nHome\" in parts, and were now about to ravish the audience with this\ntime-honoured melody.  They stood meekly side by side in a straight line\nfacing the audience, waiting for the leader to begin, and screwing their\nmouths up into the proper shape.  Just as the signal was given, and each\nhad taken a long breath and was in the act of letting out, some lout in\nthe audience laughed!  The result may be imagined.  The first note,\nwhich was to have been so beautiful, sounded just like the letting off\nof steam from four leaky safety-valves, and no effort could recover the\nmelody.  The more they tried the more they laughed.  The more they\nlaughed the more the audience roared.  There they stood, with faces of\nmingled agony and mirth, frantically trying to get the sound out; but it\nnever came, and they finally had to retire, leaving the audience to\nimagine what the effect of \"Home, Sweet Home\" might have been had they\nonly got at it.\n\nHowever, as the \"dramatic\" performance came next, the audience were\ncomforted.  The modest subject chosen was _Hamlet_.\n\nStephen, who was combining the duties of master of the ceremonies with\nthose of president, rose and said to the company, \"All turn round, and\ndon't look till I tell you.\"\n\nOf course every one pretended to turn round, and of course everybody\nlooked as hard as he could.  And they saw Bramble hop up on a chair and\nlower the gas, to represent night.  And they saw Paul and Padger stick\nup two or three forms on end, to represent a castle.  And they saw two\nother boys walk majestically on to the platform in ulsters and billycock\nhats, and their trousers turned up, and sticks in their hands to\nrepresent soldiers.\n\n\"Now you can turn round,\" cried Stephen.\n\nThey did turn round, just at the very moment when Bramble, attempting to\nlower the gas still further, turned it right out.  The effect was\nremarkable.  No one and nothing was visible, but out of the black\ndarkness came the following singular dialogue:--\n\n\"_Who's there_?\"\n\n\"Have you got a lucifer about you, any of you?\"\n\n\"_Nay, answer me.  Stand and unfold yourself_.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool (in agitated accents); you're shoving me off the\nplatform.\"\n\n\"Why don't you light up?\"\n\n\"_Long live the king_.\"\n\n\"Ah, here's one.  What's become of the chair?\"\n\nNext moment, amid great applause, the gas was re-lit, and the thrilling\ntragedy proceeded.\n\nIt went on all right till the ghost enters, and here another calamity\noccurred.  Padger was acting ghost, dressed up in a long sheet, and with\nflour on his face.  Being rather late in coming on, he did so at a very\nunghostlike pace, and in the hurry tripped up on the bottom of his\nsheet, falling flop on the platform, which, being none of the cleanest,\nleft an impression of dust on his face and garment, which greatly added\nto the horror of his appearance.  He recovered the perpendicular with\nthe help of two soldiers and a few friends, and was about to proceed\nwith his part, when the door suddenly opened and Mr Rastle appeared.\n\nHe had evidently not come to see the show--indeed he hardly seemed aware\nthat a show was going on.  His face was grave, and his voice agitated,\nas he said--\n\n\"Has any one here seen Loman?\"\n\nNo one had seen him since breakfast that morning.\n\n\"Is Greenfield senior here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Oliver.\n\n\"Will you come with me to the Doctor at once, please?\"\n\nOliver was out in the passage in a moment, and hurrying with the master\nto Dr Senior's study.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Mr Rastle, as they went--\"I'm afraid something has\nhappened to Loman!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36. MISSING.\n\nSlowly Oliver followed Mr Rastle to the Doctor's study with strange\nforebodings at heart.\n\nWhat the \"something that must have happened to Loman\" could be, he could\nnot conjecture; but the recollection of his unhappy schoolfellow's\ntroubles and of his difficulties, and--worse still--of his dishonesty\n(for Oliver had no doubt in his mind that Loman had taken the\nexamination paper), all came to his mind now with terrifying force.\n\nOliver had never been fond of Loman, as the reader knows, but somehow\nthere are times when one forgets whether one is fond of another person\nor not, and Oliver felt as if he would give anything now to be sure--\n\nHere he was at the Doctor's study.\n\nDr Senior was standing at the fireplace with a very grave look,\nholding a letter in his hand.\n\n\"Greenfield,\" said he, the moment the boy entered, \"when did you see\nLoman last?\"\n\n\"Last night, sir, after preparation.\"\n\n\"He was not in his class this morning?\"\n\n\"No, sir--he sent down word he had a headache.\"\n\n\"You saw him last night--where?\"\n\n\"In my study.\"\n\nThe Doctor paused uncomfortably, and Mr Rastle put in a question.\n\n\"Are you and Loman great friends?\"\n\n\"No, we are not friends.\"\n\n\"Does he often come to your study?\"\n\n\"No, sir.  Very rarely.\"\n\n\"May I ask, Greenfield,\" said the Doctor, \"why he was in your study last\nnight?\"\n\nThis was getting close quarters for Oliver, who, however, had made up\nhis mind he must, if put to it, say all he knew.\n\n\"He came to--to ask me about something.\"\n\n\"Yes, what?\"\n\n\"He made me promise not to tell any one.\"\n\n\"Greenfield,\" said the Doctor, seriously, \"Loman has disappeared from\nSaint Dominic's.  Why, I cannot say.  If you know of anything which will\naccount for this proceeding, you owe it to yourself, to me, and to your\nschoolfellow, who may yet be recovered, to speak plainly now.\"\n\nThe Doctor's voice, which had been stern when he began to speak,\nbetrayed his emotion before the sentence was ended, and Oliver\nsurrendered without further demur.\n\n\"He came to borrow some money,\" he replied.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Doctor.\n\nOliver had nothing for it but to narrate all he knew of Loman's recent\nmoney difficulties, of his connection with Cripps, and of his own and\nWraysford's share in helping him out of his straits.\n\nThe Doctor heard all he had to say, putting in a question here and\nthere, whenever by the boy's manner there seemed to be anything kept in\nthe background which wanted some coaxing to bring out.\n\n\"And he wanted to borrow more money yesterday, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  He said Cripps had found there was another sovereign owing,\nand had threatened to expose Loman before you and the whole school\nunless he got it at once.  But I fancy that must only have been an\nexcuse.\"\n\n\"Yes.  And did you lend him the pound?\"\n\n\"I hadn't got it to lend,\" replied Oliver, \"the last lot had completely\ncleared me out.\"\n\n\"There is one other question I want to ask you, Greenfield,\" said the\nDoctor, fidgeting with the paper in his hand.  \"How long do you suppose\nthis has been going on?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir--but should think for some time.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"Because,\" replied Oliver--and there was no help for it--\"because at the\ntime I spoke to you about the scrape my young brother got into at the\nlock, last autumn, Loman was very thick with Cripps.\"\n\n\"Indeed?  That was just before the Nightingale examination, was it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Oliver, beginning to feel the ground very uncomfortable\nall round.  Here he was telling tales right and left, and no help for\nit.  Surely the Doctor was carrying it a little too far.\n\n\"Do you suppose Loman was in debt at that time?\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" replied the boy, wondering whatever that had to do\nwith Loman's disappearance now.\n\n\"You wonder why I ask this question,\" said the Doctor, apparently\nreading the boy's thoughts.  \"This letter will explain.  I will read it\nto you, as you may be able to throw some light on it.  I received it\njust now.  It is from Cripps.\"\n\n\"Hon. Sir,--I take the liberty of informing you that one of your young\ngents, which his name is Mister Loman, is a prig.  He's been a regular\ndown at my shop this twelve month, and never paid a farthing for his\nliquor.  More than that, he's been a-drawing money from me up to\nthirty-five pounds, which I've got his promissory note due last\nMicklemas.  He said he was a-going to get a Nightingale or something\nthen that would pay it all off, and I was flat enough to believe him.\nIf that ain't enough, he's a-been and played me nicely over a rod I sold\nhim.  I might have persecuted him over that job but I didn't.  He\ncracked it to rights, and then tries to pass it back on me for same as\nwhen he got it, and if I hadn't a-been a bit sharper nor some folk I\nshould have been clean done.  This is to tell you I ain't a-going to\nstand it no longer, and if I don't get my money there'll be a rumpus up\nat the school which won't be pleasant for none of you.  So the shortest\ncut is to send on the money sharp to your humble servant, Ben Cripps.\n\n\"P.S.--I've wrote and told the young swell I've put you on the job.\"\n\n\"It is evident,\" said Mr Rastle, \"this letter has something to do with\nLoman's disappearance.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Oliver, \"he was awfully frightened of you or his father\ngetting to know about it all, sir.\"\n\n\"Foolish boy!\" said the Doctor, with a half groan.\n\nWhat little could be done at that late hour was done.  Strict inquiries\nwere made on all hands as to when and where the missing boy was last\nseen, and it was ascertained that he must have left Saint Dominic's that\nmorning during early class time, when every one supposed him ill in bed\nwith a headache.\n\nBut where had he gone, and with what object?  A telegram was sent to his\nfather, and the reply came back that the boy had not gone home, and that\nMr Loman was on his way to Saint Dominic's.  At the Maltby railway\nstation no one had seen or heard anything of him.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Rastle had gone down to the Cockchafer to see Cripps.\nThe landlord was not at home, but, said the potboy, was most likely \"up\nalong with the old 'un at the lock-'us.\"  From which Mr Rastle gathered\nthere was a chance of seeing Mr Cripps junior at the residence of Mr\nCripps senior, at Gusset Lock-house, and thither he accordingly went.\nMr Cripps junior was there, sweetly smoking, and particularly amiable.\n\nIn answer to Mr Rastle's inquiries, he made no secret of his belief\nthat the boy had run away for fear of exposure.\n\n\"You see, Mister,\" said he, \"I don't like a-getting young folk into\ntrouble, but when it comes to robbing a man downright, why, I considers\nit my dooty to give your governor the tip and let him know.\"\n\nMr Rastle had no opinion to offer on this question of morals.  What he\nwanted to know was whether Cripps had seen the boy that day, or had the\nslightest idea what had become of him.\n\nMr Cripps laughed at the idea.\n\n\"Not likely,\" he said, \"he'd tell me where he was a-goin' to, when he'd\ngot thirty-five-pound of mine in his pocket, the young thief.  All I can\nsay is, he'd better not show up again in a hurry till that little bill's\nsquared up.\"  And here Mr Cripps relapsed into quite a state of\nrighteous indignation.\n\n\"Wait till he do come back, I says,\" he repeated.  \"I'll be on him,\nmister, no error.  I'll let the folks know the kind of young gents you\nturn out up at your school, so I will.\"\n\nMr Rastle took no notice of all this.  He admitted to himself that this\nman had some reason for being disagreeable, if Loman had really\nabsconded with such a debt as he represented.\n\n\"Thirty-five pounds,\" continued Cripps, becoming quite sentimental over\nhis wrongs, \"and if you won't believe me, look at this.  This here bit\nof paper's all I've got in return for my money--all I've got!\"\n\nAnd so saying he took from his pocket and exhibited to Mr Rastle the\nvery promissory note, signed by Loman, which he had pretended to tear up\nand burn the last time that unhappy boy was at the Cockchafer.\n\nHad Mr Rastle known as much as the reader knows he would not have\nwasted more time over Mr Cripps.  He would have seen that, whatever had\nhappened to the boy, Mr Cripps's purpose was to make money by it.  But\nhe did not know all, and looked at the bill with mingled astonishment\nand sorrow as an important piece of evidence.\n\n\"He really owed you this?\" he asked.\n\n\"He did so--every brass farthing, which I've waited ever since\nMichaelmas for it, mister.  But I ain't a-going to wait no longer.  I\nmust have my money slap down, I let you know, or somebody shall hear of\nit.\"\n\n\"But he has paid you something?\" said Mr Rastle, remembering Oliver's\naccount of the loan of eight pounds.\n\n\"Has he?\" exclaimed Cripps, satirically.  \"Oh, that's all right, only I\nain't seen it, that's all.\"\n\n\"Do you mean he hasn't paid you anything?\" demanded Mr Rastle, becoming\nimpatient with his jocular manner.\n\n\"Of course, as you says so, it ain't for me to say the contrairy; but if\nyou hadn't told me, I should have said he ain't paid me one brass\nfarthing, so now.\"\n\n\"Dear me, dear me!\" exclaimed Mr Rastle.  Of course, if that was so,\nLoman must have borrowed the eight pounds from Oliver on false\npretences, and kept it for his own use.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" broke in Mr Cripps, in the midst of this meditation,\n\"I don't want to do nothing unpleasant to you, or the governor, or\nanybody.  What I say is, you'd better see this little bill put square\namong you, and then the thing can be kept quiet, do you see?  It would\nbe awkward for you to have a regular shindy about it, my man, but that's\nwhat it'll come to if I don't get my money.\"\n\nThis declaration Mr Cripps delivered in a solemn voice which was his\nnearest approach to earnestness.  But he was mistaken in expecting Mr\nRastle to be much affected or overawed by it.  On the contrary, it gave\nthat gentleman a new insight into his acquaintance's character, which\ndecided him that a prolongation of this interview would neither be\npleasant nor profitable.\n\nSo Mr Rastle abruptly turned and went, much to the regret of Cripps,\nwho had not half spoken his mind yet.\n\nReturning to the school, the master reported all he had to say, which\nwas not much.  There an anxious night was spent by the masters and the\none or two boys who were in their confidence in the matter.\n\nThe half hope that Loman might return of his own accord before night was\nquickly dispelled.  Bed-time came, and no signs of him.  Later his\nfather arrived, anxious and excited, and was closeted for some time with\nthe Doctor.\n\nMeanwhile everything that could be done at that time of night was done.\nThe Maltby newspapers were communicated with, and the police.\nUnpleasant as it was, the masters decided the right thing to do was to\nmake the matter known at once, and not damage the chance of the boy's\ndiscovery by any attempt to keep his disappearance quiet.\n\nAt dawn next day an organised search was begun, and inquiries were\nstarted in every direction.  Mr Cripps, among others, once more\nreceived the honour of a visit, this time from Mr Loman himself, who,\ngreatly to the astonishment of the worthy landlord, called for his son's\npromissory note, which, being produced, he paid without a word.  Cripps\nwas fairly taken aback by this unexpected piece of business, and even a\ntrifle disconcerted.  It never suited him to be quite square with\nanybody, and now that Mr Loman had paid every farthing that could be\nclaimed against his son, he did not like the look of Mr Loman at all,\nand he liked it less before the interview ended.  For Mr Loman (who, by\nthe way, was a barrister by profession) put his man that morning through\na cross-examination which it wanted all his wits to get over creditably.\nAs it was, he was once or twice driven completely into a corner, and\nhad to acknowledge, for the sake of telling one lie, that the last\ntwenty statements he had made had been lies too.  Still Mr Loman kept\nat him.  Now he wanted to know exactly how often his son had visited the\nCockchafer?  When he was there last?  When the time before that?  What\nhe had done during his visits?  Had he played cards?  With whom?  With\nCripps?  Had he lost?  Had Cripps won?  Had Cripps gone on letting him\nrun up a score and lose money, even though he got no payment?  Why had\nCripps done so?  Where had he expected to get payment from in the end?\n\nAltogether it was hot quarters for Cripps that morning, and once or\ntwice he struck completely, and putting himself on his dignity, declared\n\"he wasn't a-going to be questioned and brow-beated as if he was a\ncommon pickpocket!\" which objection Mr Loman quietly silenced by saying\n\"Very well,\" and turning to go, a movement which so terrified the worthy\npublican that he caved in at once, and submitted to further questions.\n\nMr Loman then followed up his advantage by finding out all he could\nabout the companions whom his son had been in the habit of meeting on\nthe occasion of his visits to the Cockchafer.  What were their names,\noccupations, addresses, and so on?  Cripps, if any one had told him\ntwenty-four hours ago that he would be meekly divulging all this\ninformation to any one in his own house, would have scoffed at the idea.\nBut there was something about Mr Loman's voice, and Mr Loman's eye,\nand Mr Loman's note-book, which was too much for the publican, and he\nsubmitted like a lamb.\n\nIn due time the ordeal was over, and Mr Loman said he would now go and\ncall upon these young gentlemen, and see what they had to say, and that\nMr Cripps would most likely hear from him again.\n\nAltogether the landlord of the Cockchafer had hardly ever passed such an\nuncomfortable morning.\n\nMeanwhile the other searchers, among whom were Oliver and Wraysford,\nwere busy.\n\nFor a whole day there came no news of the missing boy.  No one could be\nmet who had seen him or heard of him.  Neither in Maltby nor up the\nriver, nor in the country roads round, could any tidings of him be\nfound.  Towards evening those who remained anxiously behind began to\nentertain fresh fears.  Had the boy been merely running away, some one\nwould surely have seen him or heard of him.  Had anything worse happened\nto him?\n\nMr Loman and the police-inspector paid a hurried visit to the\nboathouse.  Had the boy been there?  No, no one had been there for two\ndays.  They followed the paths through the woods, asking at every\ncottage and stopping every passer-by.  But no, no one knew anything.  No\nboat had passed through the lock, no passenger on foot had gone past it.\n\nThe night came, and with it most of the searchers returned, dejected and\nworn-out.\n\nThe school was strangely silent.  Not a sound could be heard in the\npassages or class-rooms.  Nothing but the heavy rain, which now began to\nfall dismally upon the roof and windows of the old school-house.\n\nBoys who heard it shuddered, and their minds went out into the dark wet\nnight after their lost schoolfellow, wherever he might be.\n\nWhere was he now? they wondered, and how was he faring?\n\n\"Has Greenfield returned?\" asked the Doctor, as about ten o'clock the\nmasters and Mr Loman met for the mockery of supper in the head master's\nstudy.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr Jellicott.  \"I have just been inquiring.  He has not\nreturned.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" said the Doctor; \"which direction did he take?\"\n\n\"Up towards Grandham,\" said Wraysford; \"we went together as far as the\ncross roads, and then I went off on the Dallingford road and back by the\nriver.\"\n\n\"He ought to be back now,\" said the Doctor, looking concerned.\n\n\"There is no railway or coach from Grandham,\" suggested Mr Rastle; \"he\nwould have to walk back most likely.\"\n\n\"And in this rain!\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Wraysford, \"he may have heard something.\"\n\nIt was a cheery suggestion.  If it could but be true!\n\n\"He would have telegraphed,\" said Mr Loman.\n\n\"There is no telegraph office there,\" said the Doctor; \"the Grandham\npeople have to come here or to Dallingford to telegraph.\"\n\nThey waited an hour, but Oliver did not return.\n\nThe night became more and more stormy.  The bleak February wind whistled\namong the chimneys, and the hard rain beat pitilessly at the windows and\non the gravel walk outside.\n\nThe Doctor rose and pulled up the blind and looked out.  It was a dreary\nprospect.  The rain had turned to sleet, and the wind was growing fast\nto a gale.  The trees round the house creaked and groaned beneath it.\n\n\"It is a dreadful night,\" said the Doctor.  \"Those two poor boys!\"\n\nNo one else said anything.  The storm grew fiercer and fiercer.  Boys in\ntheir dormitories sit up in bed and listened to the roar of the wind as\nit howled round the house.  And that silent party in the Doctor's study\nnever once thought of seeking rest.  Midnight came; but no Oliver, no\nLoman--and the storm as furious as ever.\n\nPresently there came a soft knock at the door, which made every one\nstart suddenly as the door opened.\n\nIt was Stephen in his night-shirt.  He, like every one else, had been\nawakened by the storm.  Oliver was the monitor of his dormitory; and now\nfor the first time the boy missed his elder brother.  Where was Oliver?\nhe asked.  No one could say.  He had been out all day, and no one had\nseen him since he got back.\n\nThis was enough for Stephen.  With bounding heart and quivering lips he\nsprang from his bed and hurried down stairs.  There was a light in the\nDoctor's study; and there he went.\n\nThe boy's alarm and terror on hearing that his brother had not returned\nwas piteous to see.  He begged to be allowed to go and look for him, and\nonly the Doctor's authoritative command could put him from this purpose.\nBut nothing would induce him to return to bed; so Wraysford fetched him\nan ulster to keep out the cold.\n\nThe night wore on, by inches; and the storm raged outside with unabated\nwildness.\n\nMore than once the impulse had seized Wraysford to sally out at all\nrisks and look for his friend.  But what _could_ one do in a night like\nthis, with a blinding sleet full in one's face, and a wind which mocked\nall attempts at progress or shouting!\n\nNo, there was nothing for it but to sit patiently and await daylight.\n\nOne, two, three o'clock came, and still nothing but the storm.  Stephen\ncrouched closer up beside Wraysford, and the elder boy, as he put his\narm round the younger, could feel how his chest heaved, and how his\nteeth chattered.\n\n\"You're cold, old boy,\" said he, kindly.\n\n\"No, I'm not, Wray,\" said the boy, with a gulp; \"but don't talk, Wray,\nI--\"\n\nThe next instant Stephen, with a sudden cry, had bounded to his feet and\nrushed to the window.\n\n\"Some one called!\" he cried.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37. FOUND!\n\nThe little company of watchers sprang to their feet with one accord and\nlistened, as Stephen wildly flung up the window.  The storm burst into\nthe room as he did so, with all its vehemence, drenching those who stood\nnear, and deafening every one with its roar.  But no other sound could\nbe heard.  Stephen, heedless of the weather, stood motionless with his\nhead out of the window, listening.  Alas! it must have been a false hope\nafter all--a brother's fancy.\n\n\"A mistake, I fear,\" said Dr Senior.  \"Greenfield, I think you had\nbetter close the window.  It will be daylight in--\"\n\nHe had not time to finish his sentence, for with a sudden exclamation\nand a shout of, \"There it is again; come, Wray!\" the boy had leapt from\nthe low window, half clad as he was, into the garden.\n\nFor Wraysford to follow him was the work of an instant. Mr Rastle and\nRoach the porter did the same, while the others went hurriedly out into\nthe passage to the hall door.  Close as they were to one another,\nWraysford lost sight of Stephen for a moment in the blinding sleet which\ndashed full in their faces.  But he heard him shouting a few yards off,\nand was at his side the same moment.\n\n\"No use shouting,\" said he, \"against the wind.\"\n\n\"I _must_ shout!\" exclaimed Stephen, calling out once more.\n\n\"Where--what did you hear?\" asked Wraysford.\n\n\"Some one shouting.  I'm positive of it!\" said the boy, plunging\nforward.\n\n\"Stand still, and listen again,\" said Wraysford; \"we may be going all\nwrong.\"\n\nIt was all he could do to keep the younger boy still for a few seconds.\nWhat ages those seconds seemed!\n\nA voice somewhere?  No, only Mr Rastle and Roach coming up behind.\n\n\"Well?\" inquired the master, breathlessly.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Stephen, turning his head to the wind to listen.\n\nWhat a wind it was!  Surely it would beat any voice to shreds!\n\n\"We may as well go on,\" said the boy, impatiently.\n\n\"Wait a second or two longer,\" said Wraysford.\n\nScarcely had he spoken when, joyous sound! there came on the wind from\nsomewhere what sounded like a feeble shout!\n\nIn an instant all four bounded forward and were once more lost in the\nstorm.\n\nBut they had hope, and every moment, a night like this, was precious.\nThey groped down the garden walk, and towards the meadow, shouting as\nthey went.  Then presently they halted again and listened.\n\nYes there was the call again, and nearer.  Thank Heaven! they were on\nthe right track.  On they went once more.  Another shout!  Nearer still!\n\nOh, for a lull in the tempest, that they might give one shout back!\n\n\"Try,\" said Mr Rastle, \"they may hear it.  Here, Roach, come and\nshout--one, two, three, and a--\"\n\nWhat a shout it was!  The wind got hold of it as if it had been a\nsparrow's twitter, and tossed it mockingly over their heads and far away\nbehind them, who knows where?  \"It's no go,\" said Wraysford.  \"Hullo,\nhere's the meadow ditch.  Hadn't we better follow it up and down?\nStephen and I will take the left.\"\n\nOnce more, as they turned, a shout!\n\n\"Oh, be quick!\" cried Stephen.  \"Where does it come from?  Come, Wray,\nquick!\"\n\nThey might as well have tried to fly as run against that wind; but they\ncrawled rapidly forward.\n\nSuddenly, close at their side, rose the shout again.  With a bound the\ntwo boys were over the ditch, and in another moment a fourfold shout\nproclaimed that the wanderers were found!\n\nOliver and Loman were crouching under a tree, the former without coat or\nwaistcoat, which he had thrown round the shivering and now senseless\nform of his companion.\n\nIt was no time for words, either of joy or explanation; time enough for\nthat when every one was safe indoors.  Mr Rastle and Roach between them\ncarried Loman, while Oliver, in scarcely better plight, was helped along\nby his brother and friend.\n\n\"Is it far?\" he asked, faintly.\n\n\"No, old man; that light there is Saint Dominic's.\"\n\n\"Is it?  I didn't know that when I shouted; I thought we were miles\naway.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!  Hold up, old boy; we're just there.\"\n\nAnd so this strange procession returned before the wind to Saint\nDominic's, and when, a few minutes later, watchers and rescuers and\nrescued all gathered in the Doctor's study, Oliver, as well as Loman,\nwas insensible.\n\nIt was some days before the true story of that terrible night could be\ntold, and then Oliver only told it briefly.\n\nLate in the afternoon, as he was about to turn back, he said, he heard\nfrom a farmer's boy that he had seen a stranger that morning asleep\nunder a hedge about a mile off.  Vague as this information was, it\ndecided Oliver at once to go forward, which he did.  As might have been\nexpected, there was no trace of the \"stranger\" at the hedge, and no\namount of searching along it could discover any clue.  Still, he did not\nlike to turn back while a chance remained.  He went on towards Grandham,\ninquiring of everybody and looking everywhere.\n\nAt last--it was getting dusk--he entered a field across which ran a\nfootpath which led direct to Grandham Green.  He was half way across,\nwondering if he could by any chance find a cart or vehicle of any kind\nto drive him back to Saint Dominic's, when at the other side of the\nfield he suddenly caught sight of a figure getting up from under the\nhedge and moving quickly away.  He instantly and instinctively gave\nchase.  The other, seeing he was discovered, began to run too.  It was\nLoman.  Oliver called to him to stop, but he paid no heed.  He continued\nto run as long as he could, and then, like a hunted animal, turned at\nbay.\n\nOliver told very few all that had passed when finally he did come up\nwith the wanderer.  His first impression, judging from the unhappy boy's\nstrange and excited manner, was that he had gone out of his mind.  He\nappeared reckless and desperate at first, and determined to resist all\nattempts to bring him back.  He would sooner die than go back to Saint\nDominic's, he said.  What right had Oliver to interfere with him and dog\nhim in this way?  He had a right to go where he chose, and no one should\nstop him.  Oliver let him talk on, not attempting to reply, and avoiding\nall appearance of using force to detain him.\n\nThis wise policy had its effect.  In time the poor fellow, who was\nreally suffering more from hunger and fatigue (he had not had a morsel\nof food since the afternoon before) than from anything else, quieted\ndown, and gave up further resistance.  Oliver told him, in as few words\nas he could, of the distress which his disappearance had caused at Saint\nDominic's and to his parents, and besought him to return quietly,\npromising forgiveness for the past, and undertaking that all would be\nmade right if he would only come home.\n\nLoman listened to all doggedly.  \"You're humbugging me!\" he said.  \"You\nknow I stole that paper?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't talk of that!\" cried Oliver.  \"Do come back!\"\n\n\"You know--can't you get me something to eat?\"\n\nAs he said this he sunk down with a groan upon the grass.  Oliver\nstarted wildly to rush to the nearest cottage.  As he did so, however, a\ndoubt crossed his mind, and he said, \"You'll promise to wait here, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! be quick.\"\n\nOliver flew on the wings of the wind towards the village.  There was a\ncottage a few hundred yards away.  As he neared it, he cast one look\nback.  The wretched boy was on his feet, hurrying away in an opposite\ndirection.\n\nAnother chase ensued, though only a short one.  For Loman was in no\ncondition to hold out long.  Oliver half led, half dragged him to\nGrandham, where at last he procured food, which the unhappy fugitive\ndevoured ravenously.  Then followed another talk, far more satisfactory\nthan the last.  Restored once more in body and mind, Loman consented\nwithout further demur to accompany Oliver back to Saint Dominic's, but\nnot before he had unburdened his mind of all that was on it.\n\nOliver implored him not to do it now, to wait till he got back, and then\nto tell all to his father, not to him.  But the poor penitent was not to\nbe put off.  Until he had confessed all he would not stir a foot back to\nthe school.\n\nThen Oliver heard all that sad story with which the reader is now\nfamiliar.  How that first act of fraud about the rod had been the\nbeginning of all this misery.  How Cripps had used his advantage to\ndrive the boy from one wickedness and folly to another--from deceit to\ngambling, from gambling to debt, from debt to more deceit, and so on.\nHow drinking, low company, and vicious habits had followed.  How all the\nwhile he was trying to keep up appearances at the school, though he saw\nthat he was gradually becoming an object of dislike to his fellows.  How\nhe had staked everything--his whole hope of getting free from Cripps--on\nthe result of the Nightingale examination; and how, when the critical\nmoment came, he yielded to the tempter and stole the paper.\n\n\"And you can fancy how punished I was when, after all, the Doctor missed\nthe paper and altered the questions, Greenfield.  I was so taken aback\nthat I didn't even answer as well as I could.  And then I lost the paper\nI had stolen--couldn't find it anywhere, and for weeks I was in constant\nterror lest it should turn up.  Then I saw the fellows were all\nsuspecting you to be the thief, and you know how meanly I took advantage\nof that to hide my own guilt.  Oh, Greenfield, what a wretch, what a\nmiserable wretch I have been!\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Oliver, with true sympathy.  \"But, I say, do let's\nbe going back, it's getting late, and looks as if it might rain.\"\n\n\"I _must_ tell you the rest, Greenfield, please.  You're the only fellow\nI can tell it to.  Somehow I think if I'd had a friend like you all the\nlast year I shouldn't have gone wrong as I have.  How I used to envy you\nand Wraysford, always together, and telling one another your troubles!\nWell, of course, after the Nightingale exam, things were worse than\never.  I'd given Cripps a bill, you know, a promise to pay in September.\nI don't know anything about bills, but he made me sign it.  Of course I\ncouldn't pay when it came due, and had to make all sorts of excuses and\ntell all sorts of lies to get him to give me more time; as if I was more\nlikely to pay later on than then!  But, somehow, if I could only get the\nthing off my mind for the present, I felt that was all I cared about.\nHe gave in at last, and I was able to pay it off bit by bit.  But I was\nin constant terror all that term of his coming up to Saint Dominic's.\nYou know he did come once, at the football match against Landfield, and\nI thought I was done for.\"\n\nHere Loman paused a moment, and Oliver, seeing that he was determined to\ntell his story to the end, waited patiently till he continued.\n\n\"Then there was that Waterston exam.  I fancied I might get that if I\nworked.  Ass that I was to think, after all my wasted time and sin, I\nhad any chance against you or Wraysford!  I tried to work, but soon gave\nit up, and went on going down to the Cockchafer instead, to keep Cripps\nin good humour, till I was quite a regular there.  You know what a\nfearful hash I made of the exam.  I could answer nothing.  That very day\nCripps had sent up to threaten to tell the Doctor everything unless I\npaid what I still owed.  I had paid off all the bill but eight pounds.\nI had got some of it from home, and some of it by gambling; I'd paid off\nall but eight pounds.  You know, Greenfield, who lent me that.\"\n\n\"I'm thankful we were able to do it,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"If you'd known how I hated you and despised myself over that eight\npounds you would hardly have been glad.  Everything was hateful.  I took\nthe money down to Cripps and paid it him.  He pretended at first that he\nwouldn't take it; and then when he did, and I asked him to give me back\nmy promissory note, he laughed at me.  I nearly went mad, Greenfield, at\nthe thought of not being clear after all.  At length he did make believe\nto give in, and produced what I thought was the bill, and tore it up in\nmy presence.  I couldn't see it, but he read it out aloud, and I had no\ndoubt it was actually the thing.  I was so grateful I actually felt\nhappy.  But then came the discovery of that miserable exam paper.  I\nmust have left it in my Juvenal last September, and forgotten all about\nit.  I was certain the Doctor knew quite well I was the thief, but I\ndenied it and tried feebly to put it on you.  Then everybody cut me; but\nI hoped still all might blow over in time.  But every day it became\nharder to bear; I should have had to confess at last, I believe.  Then\ncame Cripps's final villainy.  He had never destroyed my bill after all,\nbut now calmly claimed the whole amount.\"\n\n\"The scoundrel!\" exclaimed Oliver, indignantly.\n\n\"I had no receipts to show what I had paid, and of course was at his\nmercy.  This last move really drove me half crazy.  I daren't tell any\none about it.  I was too desperate to think of anything but running away\nand hiding somewhere.  I had no money.  I came to you with a lie to try\nto borrow a pound, so that I might go somewhere by train.  You couldn't\ndo it, and so I had to walk, and--and--oh!  Greenfield, what shall I do?\nwhat will become of me?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Oliver, laying his hand on the unhappy boy's arm,\n\"we'll go back together, and I can promise you you'll find nothing but\nkindness and forgiveness when you get back.  If I wasn't sure of that, I\nwouldn't urge you to come.  There!  I wish you could have seen your poor\nfather's face last night.\"\n\nLoman held out no longer; and, indeed, it was high time to think of\nmoving, for the afternoon was closing in and rain was already beginning\nto fall.\n\nLoman was in no condition for walking, nor, indeed, was Oliver, who had\nbeen on his feet since early morning.  A farmer's cart was with some\ndifficulty found, which happened to be going a good part of the\ndistance, and in this the two boys late that afternoon ensconced\nthemselves.  They talked little at first, and presently not at all.\nEach had his own thoughts, and they were serious enough to occupy them\nfor a much longer journey.\n\nNight fell presently, soon after they had started, and with it the rain\nand wind came heavily.  There was little enough protection for these two\nworn-out ones in an empty open cart, but what they could get from an old\nwrap and some boards they secured.\n\nAs the storm grew worse this poor shelter became quite useless, and the\ntwo boys suffered all the horrors of a bitter exposure.\n\nLoman, who had got a cough already, was the first to show distress, and\nhe soon became so cold and numbed that Oliver grew alarmed.  They would\nbe better walking than sitting still in that jolting cart a night like\nthis.\n\nSo, much against their own inclination and the advice of the carman, who\ncharacterised the proceedings as \"tomfoolery,\" they alighted, and\nattempted to take the short cut across the fields to Saint Dominic's.\n\nShort cut, indeed!  It was indeed a sarcastic name for the road those\ntwo boys took that terrible night.  Oliver could never recollect all\nthat happened those few hours.  He was conscious of the tremendous\nstorm, of the hopeless losing of their way, and of Loman's relapse into\na state of half-unconsciousness, in the midst of which he constantly\nbegged to be allowed to lie down and sleep.\n\nTo prevent this was Oliver's principal occupation during that fearful\ntime.  More than once he was forced into a hand-to-hand struggle to keep\nhis companion from his purpose.  To let him lie down and sleep on such a\nnight would be, he knew, to leave him to certain death.  At any cost he\nmust be kept moving.  At last the storm fairly vanquished them.  Even\nOliver began to grow half-hearted in his determination.  He took off his\nown coat and waistcoat and pat them on his comrade, who by this time was\nstupid with cold and exhaustion.  A few minutes longer and both might\nhave given themselves up, when suddenly there flickered a light before\nthem.  All Oliver could do was to shout.  He had no power left to drag\nLoman farther, and leave him he would not.  He shouted, and the reader\nknows who heard that shout, and what the answer was.\n\nSuch was Oliver's story, and it needed little amplification.  If it had,\nthe only boy who could have added to it was in no position to do so.\nFor four weeks after that night Loman lay ill with rheumatic fever, so\nill that more than once those who watched him despaired of his recovery.\nBut he did recover, and left Saint Dominic's a convalescent, and,\nbetter still, truly penitent, looking away from self and his own poor\nefforts to Him, the World's Great Burden Bearer, whose blood \"cleanseth\nus from all sin.\"\n\nHis schoolfellows saw him no more; did not know, indeed, when he left\nthem.  Only one of them shook hands with him at the door of the old\nschool as he went.  That boy was Oliver Greenfield.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38. GOOD-BYE TO SAINT DOMINIC'S.\n\nAnd now, reader, we are at the end of our story, and there only remain\nthe usual \"last words\" before we say good-bye.\n\nSaint Dominic's flourishes still, and only last season beat the County\nby five wickets!  The captain on that occasion was a fellow called\nStephen Greenfield, who carried his bat for forty-eight in the first\ninnings.  He is a big fellow, is the captain, and has got a moustache.\nThough he is the oldest boy at Saint Dominic's, every one talks of him\nas \"Greenfield junior.\"  He is vastly popular, and fellows say there\nnever was such a good Sixth at the school since the days of his brother,\nGreenfield senior, five years ago.  The captain is an object of special\nawe among the youngsters of the Fourth Junior, who positively quake in\ntheir shoes whenever his manly form appears in the upper corridor.\n\nThese youngsters, by the way, are still the liveliest section of Saint\nDominic's.  The names Guinea-pig and Tadpole have died out, and left\nbehind them only the Buttercups and Daisies, who, however, are as fierce\nrivals and as inky scamps as even their predecessors were.  There is a\nlout of a fellow in the Fourth Senior called Bramble, who is extremely\n\"down\" on these juveniles, always snubbing them, and, along with one\nPadger, a friend of his, plotting to get them into trouble.  But somehow\nthey are not much afraid of Bramble, whereat Bramble is particularly\nfurious, and summons Padger to a \"meeting\" about once a week in his\nstudy, there to take counsel against these irreverent Buttercups and\nDaisies.\n\nAbout the only other fellow the reader will recollect is Paul, now in\nthe Sixth, a steady-going sort of fellow, who, by the way, has just won\nthe Nightingale Scholarship, greatly to the delight of his particular\nfriend the captain.\n\nLast year the Fifth tried to revive an old institution of their Form, in\nthe shape of a newspaper entitled the _Dominican_, directed chiefly\nagainst the members of the Sixth.  But somehow the undertaking did not\ncome off.  The _Dominican_ was a very mild affair for one thing, and\nthere was nothing amusing about it for another thing, and there was a\ngood deal offensive about it for another thing; and for another thing,\nthe captain ordered it to be taken down off the wall on the first day of\nits appearance, and announced that if he had any more of this nonsense\nhe would thrash one or two whose names he mentioned, and knock one or\ntwo others out of the first eleven.\n\nThe _Dominican_ has not appeared since.\n\nThe big cricket match against the County I spoke of just now was a\nfamous event for more reasons than one.  The chief reason, of course,\nwas the glorious victory of the old school; but another reason, almost\nas notable, was the strange muster of old boys who turned up to witness\nthe exploits of the \"youngsters.\"\n\nThere was Tom Braddy, for instance, smoking a big cigar the size of a\npencil-case, looking the picture of a snob.  And with him a\nvacant-looking young man with a great crop of whiskers on his puffy\ncheeks.  His name was Simon.  The great idea of these two worthies\nseemed to be to do the grand before their posterity.  They were\nconvinced in their own minds that in this they were completely\nsuccessful, but no one else saw it.\n\nBoys took a good deal more interest in a lame gentleman present, who was\ncracking jokes with everybody, and hobbling about from one old crony to\nanother in a manner that was perfectly frisky.  Every one seemed to like\nMr Pembury, and not a _few_ to be afraid of him.  Perhaps that was\nbecause he was the editor of a well-known paper of the day, and every\none likes to be on good terms with an editor.\n\nThen there were a batch of fellows whose names we need hardly enumerate,\nwho had run over from Oxford, or Cambridge, or London for the day, and\nwho got into clusters between the innings and talked and laughed a great\ndeal over old times, when \"Bully did this,\" and \"Rick did that,\" and so\non.  A nice lot of fellows they looked on the whole, and one or two, so\npeople said, were doing well.\n\nBut among these _the_ lions of the day were two friends who strolled\nabout arm-in-arm, and appeared far more at home in Saint Dominic's even\nthan the boys themselves.  One of them was the big brother of the\ncaptain--a terrible fellow by all accounts.  He rowed in the boat of his\n'Varsity the last year he was at Cambridge, and since then he has been\ncalled to the bar, and no one knows what else!  People say Oliver\nGreenfield is a rising man; if so, we may hear of him again.  At any\nrate in the eyes of the admiring youngsters of Saint Dominic's he was a\ngreat man already.\n\nSo was his friend Wraysford, a fellow of his college, and a \"coach\" for\nindustrious undergraduates.  He does not look like a tutor, certainly,\nto judge by his jovial face and the capers he persisted in cutting with\nsome of his old comrades of years ago.  But he is one, and Saint\nDominic's Junior eyed him askance shyly, and thought him rather more\nlearned and formidable a person than the old Doctor himself.\n\nNo one enjoyed themselves on that day more than these two, who prowled\nabout and visited every nook and cranny of the old place--studies,\npassages, class-rooms, Fourth Junior and all.\n\nThe match is over, the jubilations of victory have subsided, and one by\none the visitors depart.  Among the last to leave are Oliver and\nWraysford; they have stayed to dine with the Doctor, and when at last\nthey do turn their backs on the old school it is getting late.\n\nStephen accompanies them down to the station.  On the way they pass the\nwell-known Cockchafer.  The old board is still there, but a new name is\nupon it.\n\n\"Hullo! what's become of Cripps?\" asked Wraysford.\n\n\"Oh! he's gone,\" said Stephen.  \"Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"No!  When was that?\"\n\n\"The very time you and Noll went up to Cambridge.  The magistrates took\naway his licence for allowing gambling to go on at his house.  He stuck\non at the lock-house for some time, and then disappeared suddenly.  They\nsaid he was wanted for some bit of swindling or other.  Anyhow, he's\ngone.\"\n\n\"And a very good riddance too,\" says Oliver.\n\n\"So it is,\" replies Stephen.  \"By the way, Noll, what's the last news of\nLoman?\"\n\n\"Oh, I meant to tell you.  He's coming home; I had a letter from him a\nweek or two ago.  He says the four or five years' farming and knocking\nabout in Australia have pulled him together quite; you know how ill he\nwas when he went out?\"\n\n\"So he was,\" says Wraysford.\n\n\"He's coming home to be near his father and mother.  He's been reading\nlaw, he says, out in the backwoods, and means to go into his father's\noffice.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he's coming home,\" says Wraysford.  \"Poor fellow!  I wonder\nwhen he'll come to this old place again.\"\n\nA silence follows, and Oliver says, \"When he does, I tell you what: we\nmust all make up a jolly party and come down together and help him\nthrough with it.\"\n\n\"Well, old man!\" said Stephen, taking his brother's arm, \"if it hadn't\nbeen for you, he--\"\n\n\"Hullo, I say! there's the train coming!\" breaks out Oliver.  \"Look\nalive, you fellows, or we shall be late!\"\n\nTHE END.\n",
