  "content": "With Clive in India\nG. A. Henty\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nIn the following pages I have endeavoured to give a vivid picture of\nthe wonderful events of the ten years, which at their commencement saw\nMadras in the hands of the French--Calcutta at the mercy of the Nabob\nof Bengal--and English influence apparently at the point of extinction\nin India--and which ended in the final triumph of the English, both in\nBengal and Madras. There were yet great battles to be fought, great\nefforts to be made, before the vast Empire of India fell altogether\ninto British hands; but these were but the sequel of the events I have\ndescribed.\n\nThe historical details are, throughout the story, strictly accurate,\nand for them I am indebted to the history of these events written by\nMr. Orme, who lived at that time, to the \"Life of Lord Clive,\"\nrecently published by Lieutenant Colonel Malleson, and to other\nstandard authorities. In this book I have devoted a somewhat smaller\nspace to the personal adventures of my hero than in my other\nhistorical tales, but the events themselves were of such a thrilling\nand exciting nature that no fiction could surpass them.\n\nA word as to the orthography of the names and places. An entirely new\nmethod of spelling Indian words has lately been invented by the Indian\nauthorities. This is no doubt more correct than the rough-and-ready\northography of the early traders, and I have therefore adopted it for\nall little-known places. But there are Indian names which have become\nhousehold words in England, and should never be changed; and as it\nwould be considered a gross piece of pedantry and affectation on the\npart of a tourist on the Continent, who should, on his return, say he\nhad been to Genova, Firenze, and Wien, instead of Genoa, Florence, and\nVienna; it is, I consider, an even worse offence to transform Arcot,\nCawnpoor, and Lucknow, into Arkat, Kahnpur, and Laknao. I have tried,\ntherefore, so far as possible, to give the names of well-known\npersonages and places in the spelling familiar to Englishmen, while\nthe new orthography has been elsewhere adopted.\n\nG. A. Henty.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. Leaving Home.\n\n\nA lady in deep mourning was sitting, crying bitterly, by a fire in\nsmall lodgings in the town of Yarmouth. Beside her stood a tall lad of\nsixteen. He was slight in build, but his schoolfellows knew that\nCharlie Marryat's muscles were as firm and hard as those of any boy in\nthe school. In all sports requiring activity and endurance, rather\nthan weight and strength, he was always conspicuous. Not one in the\nschool could compete with him in long-distance running, and when he\nwas one of the hares there was but little chance for the hounds. He\nwas a capital swimmer, and one of the best boxers in the school. He\nhad a reputation for being a leader in every mischievous prank; but he\nwas honorable and manly, would scorn to shelter himself under the\nsemblance of a lie, and was a prime favourite with his masters, as\nwell as his schoolfellows. His mother bewailed the frequency with\nwhich he returned home with blackened eyes and bruised face; for\nbetween Dr. Willet's school and the fisher lads of Yarmouth there was\na standing feud, whose origin dated so far back that none of those now\nat school could trace it. Consequently, fierce fights often took place\nin the narrow rows, and sometimes the fisher boys would be driven back\non to the broad quay shaded by trees, by the river, and there being\nreinforced from the craft along the side, would reassume the offensive\nand drive their opponents back into the main street.\n\nIt was but six months since Charlie had lost his father, who was the\nofficer in command at the coast guard station, and his scanty pension\nwas now all that remained for the support of his widow and children.\nHis mother had talked his future prospects over, many times, with\nCharlie. The latter was willing to do anything, but could suggest\nnothing. His father had but little naval interest, and had for years\nbeen employed on coast guard service. Charlie agreed that, although he\nshould have liked of all things to go to sea, it was useless to think\nof it now, for he was past the age at which he could have entered as a\nmidshipman.\n\nThe matter had been talked over four years before, with his father;\nbut the latter had pointed out that a life in the navy, without\ninterest, is in most cases a very hard one. If a chance of\ndistinguishing himself happened, promotion would follow; but if not,\nhe might be for years on shore, starving on half pay and waiting in\nvain for an appointment, while officers with more luck and better\ninterest went over his head.\n\nOther professions had been discussed, but nothing determined upon,\nwhen Lieutenant Marryat suddenly died. Charlie, although an only son,\nwas not an only child, as he had two sisters both younger than\nhimself. After a few months of effort, Mrs. Marryat found that the\nutmost she could hope to do, with her scanty income, was to maintain\nherself and daughters, and to educate them until they should reach an\nage when they could earn their own living as governesses; but that\nCharlie's keep and education were beyond her resources. She had,\ntherefore, very reluctantly written to an uncle, whom she had not seen\nfor many years, her family having objected very strongly to her\nmarriage with a penniless lieutenant in the navy. She informed him of\nthe loss of her husband, and that, although her income was sufficient\nto maintain herself and her daughters, she was most anxious to start\nher son, who was now sixteen, in life; and therefore begged him to use\nhis influence to obtain for him a situation of some sort. The letter\nwhich she now held in her hand was the answer to the appeal.\n\n\"My dear Niece,\" it began, \"Since you, by your own foolish conduct and\nopposition to all our wishes, separated yourself from your family, and\nwent your own way in life, I have heard little of you, as the death of\nyour parents so shortly afterwards deprived me of all sources of\ninformation. I regret to hear of the loss which you have suffered. I\nhave already taken the necessary steps to carry out your wishes. I\nyesterday dined with a friend, who is one of the directors of the\nHonorable East India Company, and at my request he has kindly placed a\nwritership in the Company at your son's service. He will have to come\nup to London to see the board, next week, and will probably have to\nembark for India a fortnight later. I shall be glad if he will take up\nhis abode with me, during the intervening time. I shall be glad also\nif you will favour me with a statement of your income and expenses,\nwith such details as you may think necessary. I inclose four\nfive-pound bank notes, in order that your son may obtain such garments\nas may be immediately needful for his appearance before the board of\ndirectors, and for his journey to London. I remain, my dear niece,\nyours sincerely,\n\n\"Joshua Tufton.\"\n\n\"It is cruel,\" Mrs. Marryat sobbed, \"cruel to take you away from us,\nand send you to India, where you will most likely die of fever, or be\nkilled by a tiger, or stabbed by one of those horrid natives, in a\nfortnight.\"\n\n\"Not so bad as that, Mother, I hope,\" Charlie said sympathizingly,\nalthough he could not repress a smile; \"other people have managed to\nlive out there, and have come back safe.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mrs. Marryat said, sobbing; \"I know how you will come back. A\nlittle, yellow, shrivelled up old man with no liver, and a dreadful\ntemper, and a black servant. I know what it will be.\"\n\nThis time Charlie could not help laughing.\n\n\"That's looking too far ahead altogether, Mother. You take the two\nextremes. If I don't die in a fortnight, I am to live to be a\nshrivelled old man. I'd rather take a happy medium, and look forward\nto coming back before my liver is all gone, or my temper all\ndestroyed, with lots of money to make you and the girls comfortable.\n\n\"There is only one thing. I wish it had been a cadetship, instead of a\nwritership.\"\n\n\"That is my only comfort,\" Mrs. Marryat said. \"If it had been a\ncadetship, I should have written to say that I would not let you go.\nIt is bad enough as it is; but if you had had to fight, I could not\nhave borne it.\"\n\nCharlie did his best to console his mother, by telling her how\neveryone who went to India made fortunes, and how he should be sure to\ncome back with plenty of money; and that, when the girls grew up, he\nshould be able to find rich husbands for them; and at last he\nsucceeded in getting her to look at matters in a less gloomy light.\n\n\"And I'm sure, Mother,\" he said, \"Uncle means most kindly. He sends\ntwenty pounds, you see, and says that that is for immediate\nnecessities; so I have no doubt he means to help to get my outfit, or\nat any rate to advance money, which I can repay him out of my salary.\nThe letter is rather stiff and businesslike, of course, but I suppose\nthat's his way; and you see he asks about your income, so perhaps he\nmeans to help for the girls' education. I should go away very happy,\nif I knew that you would be able to get on comfortably. Of course it's\na long way off, Mother, and I should have liked to stay at home, to be\na help to you and the girls; but one can't have all one wishes. As far\nas I am concerned, myself, I would rather go out as a writer there,\nwhere I shall see strange sights and a strange country, than be stuck\nall my life at a desk in London.\n\n\"What is Uncle like?\"\n\n\"He is a short man, my dear, rather stiff and pompous, with a very\nstiff cravat. He used to give me his finger to shake, when I was a\nchild, and I was always afraid of him. He married a most disagreeable\nwoman, only a year or two before I married, myself. But I heard she\ndied not very long afterwards;\" and so Mrs. Marryat got talking of her\nearly days and relations, and was quite in good spirits again, by the\ntime her daughters returned from school; and she told them what she\nwas now coming to regard as the good fortune which had befallen their\nbrother.\n\nThe girls were greatly affected. They adored their brother, and the\nthought that he was going away for years was terrible to them. Nothing\nthat could be said pacified them in the slightest degree, and they did\nnothing but cry, until they retired to bed. Charlie was much affected\nby their sorrow; but when they had retired, he took his hat and went\nout to tell the news of his approaching departure to some of his\nchums.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Marryat wrote thanking her uncle for his kindness,\nand saying that Charlie would go round to London by the packet which\nsailed on the following Monday; and would, if the wind were fair and\nall went well, reach London on the Wednesday.\n\nSchool was, of course, at once given up, and the girls also had a\nholiday till their brother's departure. When the necessary clothes\nwere ordered, there was little more to do; and Charlie spent the time,\nwhen his boy friends were in school, in walking with the girls along\nthe shore, talking to them of the future, of the presents he would\nsend them home, and of the life he should lead in India; while at\nother times he went out with his favourite schoolfellows, and joined\nin one last grand battle with the smack boys.\n\nOn Monday morning, after a sad farewell to his family, Charlie\nembarked on board the Yarmouth Belle, a packet which performed the\njourney to and from London once a fortnight. She was a roomy lugger,\nbuilt for stowage rather than speed, and her hold was crammed and her\ndeck piled with packages of salted fish. There were five or six other\npersons also bound for London, the journey to which was, in those\ndays, regarded as an arduous undertaking.\n\nAs soon as the Yarmouth Belle issued from the mouth of the river, she\nbegan to pitch heavily; and Charlie, who from frequently going out\nwith his father in the revenue cutter, was a good sailor, busied\nhimself in doing his best for his afflicted fellow passengers. Towards\nevening the wind got up, and shifting ahead, the captain dropped\nanchor off Lowestoft. The next morning was finer, and the Yarmouth\nBelle continued her way. It was not, however, till Thursday afternoon\nthat she dropped anchor in the Pool.\n\nCharlie was soon on shore, and giving his trunk to a porter, desired\nhim to lead the way to Bread Street, in which his uncle resided; for\nin the last century, such things as country villas were almost\nunknown, and the merchants of London for the most part resided in the\nhouses where they carried on their business. Keeping close to the\nporter, to see that he did not make off with his trunk, for Charlie\nhad received many warnings as to the extreme wickedness of London, he\nfollowed him through the busy streets, and arrived safely at his\nuncle's door.\n\nIt was now dusk, and Charlie, on giving his name, was shown upstairs\nto a large room, which was lighted by a fire blazing in the hearth.\nStanding with his back to this was a gentleman whom he at once\nrecognized, from his mother's description, as her uncle, although he\nwas a good deal more portly than when she had seen him last.\n\n\"So you are my grandnephew,\" he said, holding out what Charlie\nconsidered to be a very limp and flabby hand towards him.\n\n\"Yes, Uncle,\" Charlie said cheerfully; \"and we are very much obliged\nto you, Mamma and I, for your kindness.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" the old gentleman grunted.\n\n\"And how is it,\" he asked severely, \"that you were not here yesterday?\nMy niece's letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday.\"\n\n\"We came as fast as we could, Uncle,\" Charlie laughed; \"but of course\nthe time depends upon the wind. The captain tells me that he has been\nas much as three weeks coming round.\"\n\nMr. Tufton grunted again as if to signify that such unpunctuality was\naltogether displeasing to him.\n\n\"You are tall,\" he said, looking up at Charlie, who stood half a head\nabove him, \"and thin, very thin. You have a loose way of standing,\nwhich I don't approve of.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm loose, sir,\" Charlie said gravely, \"if you do not\napprove of it; but you see, running about and playing games make one\nlissome. I suppose, now that's all over and I am going to spend my\ntime in writing, I shall get stiffer.\"\n\n\"I hope so, I hope so,\" Mr. Tufton said encouragingly, and as if\nstiffness were one of the most desirable things in life. \"I like to\nsee young men with a sedate bearing.\n\n\"And you left my niece and grandnieces well, I hope?\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank you, sir,\" Charlie said; \"but, of course, a good\ndeal upset with parting from me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Tufton said; \"I suppose so. Women are so emotional. Now\nthere's nothing I object to more than emotion.\"\n\nAs Charlie thought that this was probably the case, he was silent,\nalthough the idea vaguely occurred to him that he should like to\nexcite a little emotion in his uncle, by the sudden insertion of a\npin, or some other such means. The silence continued for some little\ntime, and then Mr. Tufton said:\n\n\"I always dine at two o'clock; but as probably you are hungry--I have\nobserved that boys always are hungry--some food will be served you in\nthe next room. I had already given my housekeeper orders. No doubt you\nwill find it prepared. After that, you may like to take a walk in the\nstreets. I have supper at nine, by which hour you will, of course,\nhave returned.\"\n\nCharlie, as he ate his meal, thought to himself that his uncle was a\npompous old gentleman, and that it would be very hard work getting on\nwith him, for the next three weeks. However, he consoled himself by\nthe thought:\n\n\"Kind is as kind does after all, and I expect the old gentleman is not\nas crusty as he looks.\"\n\nCharlie had handed to Mr. Tufton a letter which his mother had given\nhim, and when he returned from a ramble through the streets, he found\nthat gentleman sitting by the fire, with lights upon a small table\nbeside him. Upon this Mrs. Marryat's letter lay open.\n\n\"So you have soon become tired of the streets of London, Grandnephew!\"\nhe said.\n\n\"There is not much to see, sir. The lamps do not burn very brightly,\nand the fog is coming on. I thought that, if it grew thicker, I might\nlose my way, and in that case I might not have been in at the hour you\nnamed for supper.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" the other gentleman grunted. \"So your mother has taught you\nto be punctual to meals. But, no; boys' appetites teach them to be\npunctual then, if never at any other time.\n\n\"And why, sir?\" he asked severely, \"Did my niece not write to me\nbefore?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I suppose she did not like--that\nis, she didn't think--that is--\"\n\n\"Think, sir! Like, sir!\" said his uncle. \"What right had she either to\nthink or to like? Her duty clearly was to have made me acquainted, at\nonce, with all the circumstances. I suppose I had a right to say\nwhether I approved of my grandnieces going tramping about the world as\ngovernesses, or not. It isn't because a woman chooses, by her folly,\nto separate herself from her family, that they are to be deprived of\ntheir rights in a matter of this kind. Eh, sir, what do you say to\nthat?\" and Mr. Tufton looked very angry, indeed.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I have never thought the matter\nover.\"\n\n\"Why, sir, suppose she had made you a tinker, sir, and you turned out\na thief, as likely as not you would have done, and you'd been hung,\nsir, what then? Am I to have such discredit as this brought upon me,\nwithout my having any option in the matter?\"\n\n\"I suppose not, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I hope I shouldn't have turned\nout a thief, even if I'd been a tinker; but perhaps it was because my\nmother feared that this might be the case, that she did give you the\noption.\"\n\nHis uncle looked at him keenly; but Charlie, though with some\ndifficulty, maintained the gravest face.\n\n\"It is well she did so,\" Mr. Tufton said; \"very well. If she had not\ndone so, I should have known the reason why. And you, sir, do you like\nthe thought of going to India?\"\n\n\"Yes, Uncle, I like the thought very much, though I would rather, if I\nmay say so, have gone as a cadet.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" Mr. Tufton said, sarcastically. \"I was sure of it. You\nwanted to wear a red coat and a sword, and to swagger about the\nstreets of Calcutta, instead of making an honorable living and\nacquiring a fortune.\"\n\n\"I don't think, sir,\" Charlie said, \"that the idea of the red coat and\nsword entered into my mind; but it seemed to me the choice of a life\nof activity and adventure, against one as a mere clerk.\"\n\n\"Had you entered the military service of the Company, even if you\ndidn't get shot, you could only hope to rise to the command of a\nregiment, ranking with a civilian very low down on the list. The\nstupidity of boys is unaccountable. It's a splendid career, sir, that\nI have opened to you; but if I'd known that you had no ambition, I\nwould have put you into my own counting house; though there, that\nwouldn't have done either, for I know you would have blotted the\nledger, and turned all the accounts topsy-turvy.\n\n\"And now, sir, supper is ready;\" and the old gentleman led the way\ninto the next room.\n\nUpon the following day Charlie was introduced, by his uncle, to the\ndirector who had given him his nomination, and was told by him that\nthe board would sit upon the following day, and that he must call at\nthe India House, at eleven o'clock. The ordeal was not a formidable\none. He was shown into a room where eight or ten elderly gentlemen\nwere sitting round a large table. Among these was his friend of the\nday before. He was asked a question or two about his age, his father's\nprofession, and his place of education. Then the gentleman at the head\nof the table nodded to him, and said he could go, and instructions\nwould be sent to him, and that he was to prepare to sail in the Lizzie\nAnderson, which would leave the docks in ten days' time, and that he\nwould be, for the present, stationed at Madras.\n\nMuch delighted at having got through the ordeal so easily, Charlie\nreturned to his uncle's. He did not venture to penetrate into the\nlatter's counting house, but awaited his coming upstairs to dinner, to\ntell him the news.\n\n\"Humph!\" said his uncle; \"it is lucky they did not find out what a\nfool you were, at once. I was rather afraid that even the two minutes\nwould do it. After dinner, I will send my clerk round with you, to get\nthe few things which are necessary for your voyage.\n\n\"I suppose you will want to, what you call amuse yourself, to see the\nbeasts at Exeter Change, and the playhouses. Here are two sovereigns.\nDon't get into loose company, and don't get drinking, sir, or out of\nthe house you go.\"\n\nCharlie attempted to express his thanks, but his uncle stopped him\nabruptly.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir. I am doing what is right; a thing, sir, Joshua\nTufton always has done, and doesn't expect to be thanked for it. All I\nask you is, that if you rob the Company's till and are hung, don't\nmention that you are related to me.\"\n\nAfter dinner was over, Charlie went out under the charge of an old\nclerk, and visited tailors' and outfitters' shops, and found that his\nuncle's idea of the few necessaries for a voyage differed very widely\nfrom his own. The clerk, in each case, inquired from the tradesmen\nwhat was the outfit which gentlemen going to India generally took with\nthem, and Charlie was absolutely appalled at the magnitude of the\norders. Four dozen shirts, ten dozen pairs of stockings, two dozen\nsuits of white cotton cloth, and everything else in proportion.\nCharlie in vain remonstrated, and even implored the clerk to abstain\nfrom ordering what appeared to him such a fabulous amount of things;\nand begged him, at any rate, to wait until he had spoken to his uncle.\nThe clerk, however, replied that he had received instructions that the\nfull usual outfit was to be obtained, and that Mr. Tufton never\npermitted his orders to be questioned. Charlie was forced to submit,\nbut he was absolutely oppressed with the magnitude of his outfit, to\ncarry which six huge trunks were required.\n\n\"It is awful,\" Charlie said to himself, \"positively awful. How much it\nwill all come to, goodness only knows; three or four hundred pounds,\nat least.\"\n\nIn those days, before steam was thought of, and the journey to India\nwas often of six months' duration, men never came home more than once\nin seven years, and often remained in India from the day of their\narrival until they finally retired, without once revisiting England.\nThe outfits taken out were, therefore, necessarily much larger than at\nthe present time, when a run home to England can be accomplished in\nthree weeks, and there are plenty of shops, in every town in India,\nwhere all European articles of necessity or luxury can be purchased.\n\nAfter separating from the clerk, Charlie felt altogether unable to\nstart out in search of amusement. He wandered about vaguely till\nsupper time, and then attempted to address his uncle on the subject.\n\n\"My dear Uncle,\" he began, \"you've been so awfully kind to me, that I\nreally do not like to trespass upon you. I am positively frightened at\nthe outfit your clerk has ordered. It is enormous. I'm sure I can't\nwant so many things, possibly, and I would really rather take a much\nsmaller outfit; and then, as I want them, I can have more things out\nfrom England, and pay for them myself.\"\n\n\"You don't suppose,\" Mr. Tufton said sternly, \"that I'm going to have\nmy nephew go out to India with the outfit of a cabin boy. I ordered\nthat you were to have the proper outfit of a gentleman, and I\nrequested my clerk to order a considerable portion of the things to be\nmade of a size which will allow for your growing, for you look to me\nas if you were likely enough to run up into a lanky giant, of six feet\nhigh. I suppose he has done as I ordered him. Don't let me hear\nanother word on the subject.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. The Young Writer.\n\n\nFor the next four days, Charlie followed his uncle's instructions and\namused himself. He visited Exeter Change, took a boat and rowed down\nthe river to Greenwich, and a coach and visited the palace of Hampton\nCourt. He went to see the coaches make their start, in the morning,\nfor all places in England, and marvelled at the perfection of the\nturnouts. He went to the playhouses twice, in the evening, and saw Mr.\nGarrick in his performance as Richard the Third.\n\nOn the fifth day, a great surprise awaited him. His uncle, at\nbreakfast, had told him briefly that he did not wish him to go out\nbefore dinner, as someone might want to see him; and Charlie,\nsupposing that a messenger might be coming down from the India House,\nwaited indoors; and an hour later he was astonished, when the door of\nthe room opened and his mother and sisters entered.\n\nWith a shout of gladness and surprise, Charlie rushed into their arms.\n\n\"My dear mother, my dear girls, this is an unexpected pleasure,\nindeed! Why, what has brought you here?\"\n\n\"Didn't you know we were coming, Charlie? Didn't Uncle tell you?\" they\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Not a word,\" Charlie said. \"I never dreamt of such a thing. What, has\nhe called you up here to stay till I go?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear, he has been so kind,\" his mother said; \"and so funny! He\nwrote me such a scolding letter, just as if I had been a very naughty\nlittle girl. He said he wasn't going to allow me to bring disgrace\nupon him, by living in wretched lodgings at Yarmouth, nor by his\ngrandnieces being sent out as governesses. So he ordered me at\nonce--ordered me Charlie, as if I had no will of my own--to give up\nthe lodgings, and to take our places in the coach, yesterday morning.\nHe said we were not to shame him by appearing here in rags, and he\nsent me a hundred pounds, every penny of which, he said, was to be\nlaid out in clothes. As to the future, he said it would be his duty to\nsee that I brought no further disgrace upon the family.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he's been just as kind to me, Mother. As I told you when I\nwrote, he had ordered an enormous outfit, which will, I am sure, cost\nhundreds of pounds. He makes me go to the playhouses, and all sorts of\namusements; and all the time he has been so kind he scolds, and\ngrumbles, and predicts that I shall be hanged.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you won't,\" Kate, his youngest sister, said indignantly.\n\"How can he say such a thing?\"\n\n\"He doesn't mean it,\" Charlie laughed. \"It's only his way. He will go\non just the same way with you, I have no doubt; but you mustn't mind,\nyou know, and mustn't laugh, but must look quite grave and serious.\n\n\"Ah! Here he is.\n\n\"Oh, Uncle, this is kind of you!\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said his uncle, \"and try and learn not to\nspeak to your elders, unless you are addressed.\n\n\"Niece Mary,\" he said, kissing her upon the forehead, \"I am glad to\nsee you again. You are not so much changed as I expected.\n\n\"And these are my grandnieces, Elizabeth and Kate, though why Kate I\ndon't know. It is a fanciful name, and new to the family, and I am\nsurprised that you didn't call her Susanna, after your grandmother.\"\n\nKate made a little face at the thought of being called Susanna.\nHowever, a warning glance from Charlie closed her lips, just as she\nwas about to express her decided preference for her own name. Mr.\nTufton kissed them both, muttering to himself:\n\n\"I suppose I ought to kiss them. Girls always expect to be kissed at\nevery opportunity.\n\n\"What are you laughing at, grandniece?\"\n\n\"I don't think girls expect to be kissed, except by people they like,\"\nKate said; \"but we do like kissing you, Uncle,\" throwing her arms\nround his neck, and kissing him heartily; \"because you have been so\nkind to Charlie, and have brought us up to see him again.\"\n\n\"You have disarranged my white tie, Niece,\" Mr. Tufton said,\nextricating himself from Kate's embrace.\n\n\"Niece Mary, I fear that you have not taught your daughters to\nrestrain their emotions, and there is nothing so dreadful as emotional\nwomen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have not taken so much pains with their education, in that\nway, as in some others,\" Mrs. Marryat said, smiling. \"But of course,\nUncle, if you object to be kissed, the girls will abstain from doing\nso.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mr. Tufton said, thoughtfully. \"It is the duty of nieces to kiss\ntheir uncles, in moderation--in moderation, mind--and it is the duty\nof the uncles to receive those salutations, and I do not know that the\nduty is altogether an unpleasant one. I am, myself, unaccustomed to be\nkissed, but it is an operation to which I may accustom myself, in\ntime.\"\n\n\"I never heard it called an operation, Uncle,\" Lizzie said demurely;\n\"but I now understand the meaning of the phrase of a man's undergoing\na painful operation. I used to think it meant cutting off a leg, or\nsomething of that sort, but I see it's much worse.\"\n\nHer uncle looked at her steadily.\n\n\"I am afraid, Grandniece, that you intend to be sarcastic. This is a\nhateful habit in a man, worse in a woman. Cure yourself of it as\nspeedily as possible, or Heaven help the unhappy man who may some day\nbe your husband.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"ring the bell. The housekeeper will show you to\nyour rooms. My nephew will tell you what are the hours for meals. Of\ncourse, you will want to be gadding about with him. You will\nunderstand that there is no occasion to be in to meals; but if you are\nnot present when they are upon the table, you will have to wait for\nthe next. I cannot have my house turned upside down, by meals being\nbrought up at all sorts of hours.\n\n\"You must not expect me, Niece, to be at your beck and call during the\nday, as I have my business to attend to; but of an evening I shall, of\ncourse, feel it my duty to accompany you to the playhouse. It will not\ndo for you to be going about with only the protection of a\nhare-brained boy.\"\n\nThe remainder of Charlie's stay in London passed most pleasantly. They\nvisited all the sights of town, Mr. Tufton performing what he called\nhis duty with an air of protest, but showing a general thoughtfulness\nand desire to please his visitors, which was very apparent even when\nhe grunted and grumbled the most.\n\nOn the evening before he started, he called Charlie down into his\ncounting house.\n\n\"Tomorrow you are going to sail,\" he said, \"and to start in life on\nyour own account, and I trust that you will, as far as possible, be\nsteady, and do your duty to your employers. You will understand that,\nalthough the pay of a writer is not high, there are opportunities for\nadvancement. The Company have the monopoly of the trade of India, and\nin addition to their great factories at Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras,\nthey have many other trading stations. Those who, by their good\nconduct, attract the attention of their superiors, rise to positions\nof trust and emolument. There are many who think that the Company\nwill, in time, enlarge its operations; and as they do so, superior\nopportunities will offer themselves; and since the subject of India\nhas been prominently brought before my notice, I have examined the\nquestion, and am determined to invest somewhat largely in the stock of\nthe Company, a step which will naturally give me some influence with\nthe board. That influence I shall, always supposing that your conduct\nwarrants it, exercise on your behalf.\n\n\"As we are now at war with France, and it is possible that the vessel\nin which you are proceeding may be attacked by the way, I have thought\nit proper that you should be armed. You will, therefore, find in your\ncabin a brace of pistols, a rifle, and a double-barrel shotgun: which\nlast, I am informed, is a useful weapon at close quarters. Should your\navocations in India permit your doing so, you will find them useful in\nthe pursuit of game. I hope that you will not be extravagant; but as a\nmatter of business I find that it is useful to be able to give\nentertainments, to persons who may be in a position to benefit or\nadvance you. I have, therefore, arranged that you will draw from the\nfactor at Madras the sum of two hundred pounds, annually, in addition\nto your pay. It is clearly my duty to see that my nephew has every\nfair opportunity for making his way.\n\n\"Now, go upstairs at once to your mother. I have letters to write, and\nam too busy for talking.\"\n\nSo saying, with a peremptory wave of his hand he dismissed his nephew.\n\n\"Well, Mother,\" Charlie said, after telling her of his uncle's\ngenerosity, \"thank goodness you will be all right now, anyhow. No\ndoubt Uncle intends to do something for you and the girls, though he\nhas said nothing at present, beyond the fact that you are not to be in\nwretched lodgings, and they are not to go out as governesses. But even\nif he should change his mind, and I don't think he ever does that, I\nshall be able to help you.\n\n\"Oh, he is kind, isn't he?\"\n\nThe parting was far less sad than that which had taken place at\nYarmouth. Charlie was now assured that his mother and sisters would be\ncomfortable, and well cared for in his absence; while his mother,\nhappy in the lightening of her anxiety as to the future of her\ndaughters, and as to the prospects of her son, was able to bear with\nbetter heart the thought of their long separation.\n\nMrs. Marryat and the girls accompanied him on board ship. Mr. Tufton\ndeclined to join the party, under the plea that, in the first place,\nhe was busy; and in the second, that he feared there would be an\nemotional display. He sent, however, his head clerk with them, to\nescort the ladies on their return from the docks.\n\nThe Lizzie Anderson was a fine ship, of the largest size, and she was\nalmost as clean and trim as a man of war. She carried twelve cannon,\ntwo of them thirty-two pounders, which were in those days considered\nlarge pieces of ordnance. All the ships of the Company, and, indeed,\nall ocean-going merchantmen of the day, were armed, as the sea swarmed\nwith privateers, and the black flag of the pirates was still\noccasionally to be seen.\n\nThe girls were delighted with all they saw, as, indeed, was Charlie;\nfor accustomed, as they were, only to the coasting vessels which\nfrequented the port of Yarmouth, this floating castle appeared to them\na vessel of stupendous size and power.\n\nThis was Charlie's first visit, also, to the ship, for his uncle had\ntold him that all directions had been given, that the trunks with the\nthings necessary for the voyage would be found in his cabin, at the\ntime of starting, and the rest of the luggage in the hold. Everything\nwas in order, and Charlie found that his cabin companion was a doctor\nin the service, returning to Madras. He was a pleasant man, of some\nfive or six and thirty, and assured Mrs. Marryat that he would soon\nmake her son at home on board ship, and would, moreover, put him up to\nthe ways of things upon his arrival in India. There were many visitors\non board, saying goodbye to their friends, and all sat down to lunch,\nserved in the saloon.\n\nWhen this was over, the bell rang for visitors to go ashore. There was\na short scene of parting, in which Charlie was not ashamed to use his\nhandkerchief as freely as did his mother and sisters. Five minutes\nlater, the great vessel passed through the dock gates. Charlie stood\nat the stern, waving his handkerchief as long as he could catch a\nglimpse of the figures of his family; and then as, with her sails\nspread and the tide gaining strength every minute beneath her, the\nvessel made her way down the river, he turned round to examine his\nfellow passengers.\n\nThese were some twenty in number, and for the most part men. Almost\nall were, in some capacity or other, civil or military, in the service\nof the Company; for at that time their monopoly was a rigid one, and\nnone outside its boundary were allowed to trade in India. The Company\nwas, indeed, solely a great mercantile house of business. They had\ntheir own ships, their own establishments, and bought and sold goods\nlike other traders. They owned a small extent of country, round their\nthree great trading towns; and kept up a little army, composed of two\nor three white regiments; and as many composed of natives, trained and\ndisciplined like Europeans, and known as Sepoys. Hence the clergyman,\nthe doctor, a member of the council of Madras, four or five military\nofficers, twice as many civilians, and three young writers, besides\nCharlie, were all in the employment of the Company.\n\n\"Well, youngster,\" a cheery voice said beside him, \"take your last\nlook at the smoke of London, for it will be a good many years before\nyou see it again, my lad. You've blue skies and clear ones where\nyou're going, except when it rains, and when it does there is no\nmistake about it.\"\n\nThe speaker was the captain of the Lizzie Anderson, a fine sailor-like\nman of some fifty years, of which near forty had been spent in the\nservice of the Company.\n\n\"I'm not a Londoner,\" Charlie said, smiling, \"and have no regret for\nleaving its smoke. Do you think we shall make a quick voyage?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" the captain said, \"but it all depends upon the wind. A\nfiner ship never floated than the Lizzie Anderson; but the Company\ndon't build their vessels for speed, and it's no use trying to run,\nwhen you meet a Frenchman. Those fellows understand how to build\nships, and if they could fight them as well as they build them, we\nshould not long be mistress of the sea.\"\n\nMost of the people on board appeared to know each other, and Charlie\nfelt rather lonely, till the doctor came up and began to chat with\nhim. He told him who most of his fellow passengers were:\n\n\"That gentleman there, walking on the other side of the deck, as if\nnot only the ship but the river and banks on both sides belonged to\nhim, is one of the council. That is his wife over there, with a\ncompanion holding her shawl for her. That pretty little woman, next to\nher, is the wife of Captain Tibbets, the tall man leaning against the\nbulwarks. Those two sisters are going out to keep house for their\nuncle, one of the leading men in Madras; and, I suppose, to get\nhusbands, which they will most likely do before they have been there\nmany weeks. They look very nice girls.\n\n\"But you soon get acquainted with them all. It is surprising how soon\npeople get friendly on board ship, though, as a rule, they quarrel\nlike cats and dogs before they get to the end of it.\"\n\n\"What do they quarrel about?\" Charlie asked, surprised.\n\n\"Oh, about anything or nothing,\" the doctor said. \"They all get\nheartily sick of each other, and of the voyage, and they quarrel\nbecause they have nothing else to do. You will see, we shall be as\nhappy a party as possible till we get about as far as the Cape. After\nthat, the rows will begin, and by the time we get to India, half the\npeople won't speak to each other.\n\n\"Have you been down the river before? That's Gravesend. I see the\ncaptain is getting ready to anchor. So, I suppose the tide has nearly\nrun out. If this wind holds, we shall be fairly out at sea when you\nget up tomorrow.\n\n\"You snore, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I don't think so,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I hoped you did,\" the doctor said, \"because I'm told I do, sometimes.\nHowever, as I usually smoke a cigar on deck, the last thing, I hope\nyou will be fairly asleep before I am. If at any time I get very bad,\nand keep you awake, you must shake me.\"\n\nCharlie said it took a good deal to keep him awake, and that he should\nprobably get accustomed to it, ere long.\n\n\"It's better to do that,\" he said with a laugh, \"than to keep on\nwaking you, for the next four or five months.\"\n\nA week later, the Lizzie Anderson was running down the Spanish coast,\nwith all sail set. She was out of sight of land, and so far had seen\nnothing likely to cause uneasiness. They had met many vessels,\nhomeward bound from the Mediterranean, and one or two big ships which\nthe captain pronounced to be Indiamen. That morning, however, a vessel\nwas seen coming out from the land. She seemed, to Charlie's eyes,\nquite a small vessel, and he was surprised to see how often the\ncaptain and officers turned their glasses towards her.\n\n\"I fancy our friend over there is a French privateer,\" the doctor\nremarked to him; \"and I should not be surprised if we found ourselves\nexchanging shots with her, before many hours are over.\"\n\n\"But she's a little bit of a thing,\" Charlie said. \"Surely she would\nnever venture to attack a ship like ours.\"\n\n\"It's the size of the guns, not the size of the ship, that counts, my\nboy. She has the advantage of being able to sail three feet to our\ntwo; and probably, small as she is, she carries half as many men again\nas we do. However, we carry heavy metal, and can give a good account\nof ourselves. Those thirty-twos will astonish our friend, if she comes\nwithin range.\"\n\nThe stranger was a large schooner, and the tautness of the spars and\nrigging showed that she was in beautiful order. She crossed the line\nupon which the merchantman was sailing, some two miles in her rear;\nand then, bearing up, followed in her wake.\n\nCharlie stood near the captain, who, instead of watching her, was\nsweeping the horizon with his glass. Presently he paused, and gazed\nintently at a distant object.\n\n\"I thought so,\" he said to the first officer. \"I fancied that fellow\nwasn't alone. He would hardly have ventured to try his strength with\nus, if he had been. Send a man up to the tops, and let him see what he\ncan make her out to be. I can only see her topmasts, but I can make\nout no yards.\"\n\nPresently the lookout came down, and reported that the distant vessel\nappeared to be a large fore-and-aft schooner, bearing down upon them.\n\n\"She will not be up for two hours, yet,\" the captain said. \"It will be\ngetting dark, then. It is not likely they will engage at night, but\nthey will keep close, and show their teeth at daybreak.\"\n\nIt soon became known that the belief of the captain was that the\nvessel in their wake, and that which could be seen approaching on the\nbeam, were French privateers; and soon all were preparing, in their\nown way, for what might happen. The sailors cleared the decks, and\nloosed the guns. The gentlemen went below, and shortly returned\nbringing up rifles and fowling pieces. Small arms and cutlasses were\nbrought up, and piled round the masts.\n\n\"Why don't you put on more sail, sir?\" Mr. Ashmead, the member of the\ncouncil, said to the captain. \"My wife, sir, objects to the sound of\nfirearms, and I must really beg that you will increase your speed. As\nit is, we are losing rather than gaining upon that vessel behind. The\nduty of the ships of the Company is to try not to fight.\"\n\n\"If they can help it,\" the captain added quietly. \"Not to fight, if\nthey can help it, Mr. Ashmead. But unfortunately, the choice upon the\npresent occasion lies with the gentlemen yonder, and not with us. It\nis not of the slightest use adding to the sail we carry, for at our\nvery best speed, those schooners could sail round and round us. As\nnight comes on I intend to shorten sail, and put the ship into\nfighting trim. In the morning I shall again increase it, but I shall\nnot make any attempt to escape a combat which it depends entirely on\nthose privateers to bring on, or not, as they choose. I am sorry that\nMrs. Ashmead should be exposed to the unpleasantness of listening to\nthe explosion of firearms, and that my other lady passengers should be\nexposed to the danger which cannot but arise, more or less, from a\nnaval conflict.\n\n\"However, I hope, sir, that there need be no great anxiety as to the\nresult. The Company has given us a heavy armament, and you may be sure\nthat we shall all do our best.\"\n\nSeeing the gentlemen go below for their guns, Charlie asked one of the\nother young writers, a lad of about his own age, named Peters, with\nwhom he had become very friendly, to go below with him. He had not yet\nexamined the arms that his uncle had given him, for he had not thought\nof them since he saw the gun cases under his berth, on his first\narrival on board ship. He found the doctor already in his cabin,\nputting together a heavy double-barrelled gun.\n\n\"Well, youngster,\" he said, \"so we're likely to have a brush. I see\nyou have a couple of gun cases under your berth. You are a good deal\nbetter provided than most lads who go out as writers.\n\n\"Ah! That's a beautiful piece of yours,\" he said, as Charlie unlocked\none of the cases and took out a rifle, \"a small bore and a heavy\nbarrel, and beautifully finished. With a greased patch and a heavy\ncharge, that ought to carry a bullet far and true. Have you had any\npractice?\"\n\n\"Not with this gun, sir. I used, sometimes, to practise shooting at\ngulls with a musket, on board the cutter my father commanded; and I\ngot to be a fair shot with it.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to be able to do good work, with such a piece as that.\nWhat is in the other case?\n\n\"Ah! That's a beauty, too,\" he said, as he examined the\ndouble-barrelled gun. \"Made extra strong and heavy, I see, so as to\ncarry bullets. You'll find your shoulder ache, at first; but you'll\nget accustomed to it, in time. I'm always in favour of heavy barrels.\nThey shoot stronger and straighter than your light guns, are not so\nliable to get bent or bruised, if a stupid servant drops one across a\nstone; and, after all, two or three pounds difference in weight does\nnot make any material difference, when you're accustomed to it.\nAlthough, I grant, a heavy gun does not come quite so quickly up to\nthe shoulder, for a snap shot.\"\n\n\"Now, Peters,\" Charlie said, \"you take the double barrel. I will use\nthe rifle. Mine will come into play first, but, as my uncle said when\nhe gave it me, yours will do most execution at close quarters.\"\n\nAt dusk the schooners, having exchanged some signals by flags, took up\ntheir positions, one on each quarter of the ship, at a distance of\nsome two miles.\n\n\"Do not you think,\" Charlie asked his friend the doctor, \"that they\nare likely to try and board us tonight?\"\n\n\"No,\" the doctor said. \"These privateers generally depend upon their\nlong guns. They know that we shall be on the watch all night, and\nthat, in a hand-to-hand fight, they would lose a considerable number\nof men; while by keeping at a distance, and maintaining a fire with\ntheir long guns, they rely upon crippling their opponents; and then,\nranging up under their stern, pouring in a fire at close quarters\nuntil they surrender.\n\n\"Another thing is that they prefer daylight, as they can then see\nwhether any other vessel is approaching. Were one of our cruisers to\nhear a cannonade in the night, she would come down and take them\nunaware. No, I think you will see that at daylight, if the coast is\nclear, they will begin.\"\n\nSuch was evidently the captain's opinion also, as he ordered sail to\nbe still further shortened, and all, save the watch on deck, to turn\nin at once. The lights were all extinguished, not that the captain had\nany idea of evading his pursuers, but that he wished to avoid offering\nthem a mark for their fire, should they approach in the darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. A Brush With Privateers.\n\n\nThe night passed quietly. Once or twice lights were seen, as the\nschooners showed a lantern for a moment to notify their exact position\nto each other.\n\nAs soon as dawn broke, every man on board the Lizzie Anderson was at\nhis post. The schooners had drawn up a little, but were still under\neasy sail. The moment that the day grew clear enough for it to be\nperceived that no other sail could be seen above the horizon, fresh\nsail was spread upon the schooners, and they began rapidly to draw up.\n\nOn the previous evening the four heavy guns had been brought aft, and\nthe Indiaman could have made a long running fight with her opponents,\nhad the captain been disposed. To this, however, he objected strongly,\nas his vessel was sure to be hulled and knocked about severely, and\nperhaps some of his masts cut down. He was confident in his power to\nbeat off the two privateers, and he therefore did not add a stitch of\ncanvas to the easy sail under which he had been holding on all night.\n\nPresently a puff of smoke shot out from the bow of the schooner from\nthe weather quarter, followed almost instantaneously by one from her\nconsort. Two round shot struck up the water, the one under the\nIndiaman's stern, the other under her forefoot.\n\n\"The rascals are well within range,\" the captain said quietly. \"See,\nthey are taking off canvas again. They intend to keep at that\ndistance, and hammer away at us. Just what I thought would be their\ntactics.\"\n\nTwo more shots were fired by the schooners. One flew over the deck\nbetween the masts, and plunged harmlessly in the sea beyond. The other\nstruck the hull with a dull crash.\n\n\"It is lucky the ladies were sent into the hold,\" the captain said.\n\"That shot has gone right through their cabin.\n\n\"Now, my lads, have you got the sights well upon them? Fire!\"\n\nThe four thirty-two pounders spoke out almost at the same moment, and\nall gazed over the bulwarks anxiously to watch the effect, and a cheer\narose as it was seen how accurate had been the aim of the gunners. One\nshot struck the schooner to windward in the bow, a foot or two above\nthe water level. Another went through her foresail, close to the mast.\n\n\"A foot more, and you would have cut his foremast asunder.\"\n\nThe vessel to leeward had been struck by only one shot, the other\npassing under her stern. She was struck just above her deck line, the\nshot passing through the bulwark, and, as they thought on board the\nmerchantman, narrowly missing if not actually striking the mainmast.\n\n\"There is some damage done,\" Dr. Rae said, keeping his glass fixed on\nthe vessel. \"There is a good deal of running about on deck there.\"\n\nIt was evident that the display of the heavy metal carried by the\nIndiaman was an unpleasant surprise to the privateers. Both lowered\nsail and ceased firing, and there was then a rapid exchange of signals\nbetween them.\n\n\"They don't like it,\" the captain said, laughing. \"They see that they\ncannot play the game they expected, and that they've got to take as\nwell as to give. Now it depends upon the sort of stuff their captains\nare made of, whether they give it up at once, or come straight up to\nclose quarters.\n\n\"Ah! They mean fighting.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a cloud of canvas was spread upon the schooners and,\nsailing more than two feet to the merchantman's one, they ran quickly\ndown towards her, firing rapidly as they came. Only the merchantman's\nheavy guns replied, but these worked steadily and coolly, and did\nconsiderable damage. The bowsprit of one of their opponents was shot\naway. The sails of both vessels were pierced in several places, and\nseveral ragged holes were knocked in their hulls.\n\n\"If it were not that I do not wish to sacrifice any of the lives on\nboard, unnecessarily,\" the captain said, \"I would let them come\nalongside and try boarding. We have a strong crew, and with the sixty\nsoldiers we should give them such a reception as they do not dream of.\nHowever, I will keep them off, if I can.\n\n\"Now, Mr. James,\" he said to the first officer, \"I propose to give\nthat vessel to leeward a dose. They are keeping about abreast, and by\nthe course they are making will range alongside at about a cable's\nlength. When I give the word, pour a broadside with the guns to port\nupon that weather schooner.\n\n\"At that moment, gentlemen,\" he said, turning to the passengers, \"I\nshall rely upon you to pick off the steersman of the other vessel, and\nto prevent another taking his place. She steers badly now, and the\nmoment her helm is free, she'll run up into the wind. As she does so,\nI shall bear off, run across her bow, and rake her deck with grape as\nwe pass.\n\n\"Will you, Mr. Barlow, order your men to be in readiness to open fire\nwith musketry upon her, as we pass?\"\n\nThe schooners were now running rapidly down upon the Indiaman. They\nwere only able to use the guns in their bows, and the fire of the\nIndiaman from the heavy guns on her quarter was inflicting more damage\nthan she received.\n\n\"Let all hands lie down on deck,\" the captain ordered. \"They will open\nwith their broadside guns, as they come up. When I give the word, let\nall the guns on the port side be trained at the foot of her mainmast,\nand fire as you get the line. On the starboard side, lie down till I\ngive the word.\"\n\nIt was a pretty sight as the schooners, throwing the water high up\nfrom their sharp cut-waters, came running along, heeling over under\nthe breeze. As they ranged alongside, their topsails came down, and a\nbroadside from both was poured into the Indiaman. The great ship shook\nas the shot crashed into her, and several sharp cries told of the\neffect which had been produced.\n\nThen the captain gave the word, and a moment afterwards an irregular\nbroadside, as the captain of each gun brought his piece to bear, was\npoured into the schooner from the guns on the port side. As the\nprivateer heeled over, her deck could be plainly seen, and the shot of\nthe Indiaman, all directed at one point, tore up a hole around the\nfoot of the mainmast. In an instant the spar tottered and, with a\ncrash, fell alongside. At the same moment, three of the passengers\ntook a steady aim over the bulwark at the helmsman of the other\nprivateer and, simultaneously with the reports of their pieces, the\nman was seen to fall. Another sprang forward to take his place, but\nagain the rifles spoke out, and he fell beside his comrade.\n\nFreed from the strain which had counteracted the pressure of her\nmainsail, the schooner flew up into the wind. The Indiaman held on her\ncourse for another length, and then her helm was put up, and she swept\ndown across the bows of the privateer. Then the men leaped to their\nfeet, the soldiers lined the bulwarks, and as she passed along a few\nyards only distant from her foe, each gun poured a storm of grape\nalong her crowded deck, while the troops and passengers kept up a\ncontinuous fire of musketry.\n\n\"That will do,\" the captain said, quietly. \"Now we may keep her on her\ncourse. They have had more than enough of it.\"\n\nThere was no doubt of that, for the effect of the iron storm had been\nterrible, and the decks of the schooner were strewn with dead and\ndying. For a time after the merchantman had borne upon her course, the\nsails of the schooner flapped wildly in the wind, and then the\nforemast went suddenly over the side.\n\n\"I should think you could take them both, Captain Thompson,\" one of\nthe passengers said.\n\n\"They are as good as taken,\" the captain answered, \"and would be\nforced to haul down their flags, if I were to wear round and continue\nthe fight. But they would be worse than useless to me. I should not\nknow what to do with their crews, and should have to cripple myself by\nputting very strong prize crews upon them, and so run the risk of\nlosing my own ship and cargo.\n\n\"No, my business is to trade and not to fight. If any one meddle with\nme, I am ready to take my own part; but the Company would not thank\nme, if I were to risk the safety of this ship and her valuable cargo\nfor the sake of sending home a couple of prizes, which might be\nrecaptured as they crossed the bay, and would not fetch any great sum\nif they got safely in port.\"\n\nAn examination showed that the casualties on board the Lizzie Anderson\namounted to three killed and eight wounded. The former were sewn in\nhammocks, with a round shot at their feet, and dropped overboard; the\nclergyman reading the burial service. The wounded were carried below,\nand attended to by the ship's surgeon and Doctor Rae. The ship's decks\nwere washed, and all traces of the conflict removed. The guns were\nagain lashed in their places, carpenters were lowered over the side to\nrepair damages; and when the ladies came on deck an hour after the\nconflict was over, two or three ragged holes in the bulwarks, and a\nhalf dozen in the sails, were the sole signs that the ship had been in\naction; save that some miles astern could be seen the two crippled\nprivateers, with all sails lowered, at work to repair damages.\n\nTwo or three days afterwards, Charlie Marryat and his friend Peters\nwere sitting beside Doctor Rae, when the latter said:\n\n\"I hope that we sha'n't find the French in Madras, when we get there.\"\n\n\"The French in Madras!\" Charlie exclaimed in surprise. \"Why, sir,\nthere's no chance of that, is there?\"\n\n\"A very great chance,\" the doctor said. \"Don't you know that they\ncaptured the place three years ago?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I'm ashamed to say that I know nothing at all about India,\nexcept that the Company have trading stations at Bombay, Madras, and\nCalcutta.\"\n\n\"I will tell you about it,\" the doctor said. \"It is as well that you\nshould understand the position of affairs, at the place to which you\nare going. You must know that the Company hold the town of Madras, and\na few square miles of land around it, as tenants of the Nawab of the\nCarnatic, which is the name of that part of India. The French have a\nstation at Pondicherry, eighty-six miles to the sou'west of Madras.\nThis is a larger and more important town than Madras, and of course\nthe greatest rivalry prevails between the English and French.\n\n\"The French are much more powerful than the English, and exercise a\npredominating influence throughout the Carnatic. The French governor,\nMonsieur Dupleix, is a man of very great ability, and far-seeing\nviews. He has a considerable force of French soldiers at his command,\nand by the aid which he has given to the nawab, upon various\noccasions, he has obtained a predominating influence in his councils.\n\n\"When war was declared between England and France, in the year '44,\nthe English squadron under Commodore Barnet was upon the coast, and\nthe Company sent out orders to Mr. Morse, the governor of Madras, to\nuse every effort to destroy the French settlement, of whose rising\npower they felt the greatest jealousy. Dupleix, seeing the force that\ncould be brought against him, and having no French ships on the\nstation, although he was aware that a fleet under Admiral La\nBourdonnais was fitting out and would arrive shortly, dreaded the\ncontest, and proposed to Mr. Morse that the Indian colonies of the two\nnations should remain neutral, and take no part in the struggle in\nwhich their respective countries were engaged. Mr. Morse, however, in\nview of the orders he had received from the Company, was unable to\nagree to this.\n\n\"Dupleix then applied to the nawab who, at his request, forbade his\nEuropean tenants to make war on land with each other, an order which\nthey were obliged to obey.\n\n\"In July, 1746, La Bourdonnais arrived with his fleet, and chased the\nsmall English squadron from the Indian seas. Dupleix now changed his\ntactics, and regardless of the injunction which he himself had\nobtained from the nawab, he determined to crush the English at Madras.\nHe supplied the fleet with men and money, and ordered the admiral to\nsail for Madras. The fleet arrived before the town on the 14th of\nSeptember; landed a portion of its troops, six hundred in number, with\ntwo guns, a short distance along the coast; and on the following day\ndisembarked the rest, consisting of a thousand French troops, four\nhundred Sepoys, and three hundred African troops, and summoned Madras\nto surrender.\n\n\"Madras was in no position to offer any effectual resistance. The fort\nwas weak and indefensible. The English inhabitants consisted only of a\nhundred civilians, and two hundred soldiers. Governor Morse\nendeavoured to obtain, from the nawab, the protection which he had\nbefore granted to Dupleix, a demand which the nawab at once refused.\n\n\"I was there at the time, and quite agreed with the governor that it\nwas useless to attempt resistance to the force brought against us. The\ngovernor, therefore, surrendered on the 21st. The garrison, and all\nthe civilians in the place not in the service of the Company, were to\nbecome prisoners of war; while those in the regular service of the\nCompany were free to depart, engaging only not to carry arms against\nthe French until exchanged. These were the official conditions; but La\nBourdonnais, influenced by jealousy of Dupleix, and by the promise of\na bribe of forty thousand pounds, made a secret condition with Mr.\nMorse, by which he bound himself to restore Madras in the future, upon\nthe payment of a large sum of money. This agreement Dupleix, whose\nheart was set upon the total expulsion of the English, refused to\nratify.\n\n\"A good many of us considered that, by this breach of the agreement,\nwe were released from our parole not to carry arms against the French;\nand a dozen or so of us, in various disguises, escaped from Madras and\nmade our way to Fort Saint David, a small English settlement twelve\nmiles south of Pondicherry. I made the journey with a young fellow\nnamed Clive, who had come out as a writer about two years before. He\nwas a fine young fellow; as unfitted as you are, I should think,\nMarryat, for the dull life of a writer, but full of energy and\ncourage.\n\n\"At Fort Saint David we found two hundred English soldiers, and a\nhundred Sepoys, and a number of us, having nothing to do at our own\nwork, volunteered to aid in the defence.\n\n\"After Dupleix had conquered Madras, the nawab awoke to the fact of\nthe danger of allowing the French to become all-powerful, by the\ndestruction of the English, and ordered Dupleix to restore the place.\nDupleix refused, and the nawab sent his son Maphuz Khan to invest the\ntown. Dupleix at once despatched a detachment of two hundred and\nthirty French, and seven hundred Sepoys, commanded by an engineer\nofficer named Paradis, to raise the siege.\n\n\"On the 2nd of November, the garrison of Madras sallied out and drove\naway the cavalry of Maphuz Khan; and on the 4th, Paradis attacked his\narmy, and totally defeated it.\n\n\"This, lads, was a memorable battle. It is the first time that\nEuropean and Indian soldiers have come into contest, and it shows how\nimmense is the superiority of Europeans. What Paradis did then opens\nall sorts of possibilities for the future; and it may be that either\nwe or the French are destined to rise, from mere trading companies, to\nbe rulers of Indian states.\n\n\"Such, I know, is the opinion of young Clive, who is a very\nlong-headed and ambitious young fellow. I remember his saying to me\none night, when we were, with difficulty, holding our own in the\ntrenches, that if we had but a man of energy and intelligence at the\nhead of our affairs in Southern India, we might, ere many years\npassed, be masters of the Carnatic. I own that it appears to me more\nlikely that the French will be in that position, and that we shall not\nhave a single establishment left there; but time will show.\n\n\"Having defeated Maphuz Khan, Dupleix resolved to make a great effort\nto expel us from Fort Saint David, our sole footing left in Southern\nIndia; and he despatched an army of nine hundred Frenchmen, six\nhundred Sepoys, and a hundred Africans, with six guns and mortars,\nagainst us. They were four to one against us, and we had hot work, I\ncan tell you. Four times they tried to storm the place, and each time\nwe drove them back; till at last they gave it up in disgust, at the\nend of June, having besieged us for six months.\n\n\"Soon after this Admiral Boscawen, with a great fleet and an army,\narrived from England; and on 19th of August besieged Pondicherry. The\nbesieging army was six thousand strong; of whom three thousand, seven\nhundred and twenty were English. But Pondicherry resisted bravely, and\nafter two months the besiegers were forced to retire, having lost, in\nattacks or by fever, one thousand and sixty-five men.\n\n\"At the end of the siege, in which I had served as a medical officer,\nI returned to England. A few months after I left, peace was made\nbetween England and France, and by its terms Dupleix had to restore\nMadras to the English. I hear that fighting has been going on ever\nsince, the English and French engaging as auxiliaries to rival native\nprinces; and especially that there was some hot fighting round\nDevikota. However, we shall hear about that when we get there.\"\n\n\"And what do you think will be the result of it all, Doctor Rae?\"\n\n\"I think that undoubtedly, sooner or later, either the French or\nourselves will be driven out. Which it will be remains to be seen. If\nwe are expelled, the effect of our defeat is likely to operate\ndisastrously at Calcutta, if not at Bombay. The French will be\nregarded as a powerful people, whom it is necessary to conciliate,\nwhile we shall be treated as a nation of whom they need have no fear,\nand whom they can oppress accordingly.\n\n\"If we are successful, and absolutely obtain possession of the\nCarnatic, our trade will vastly increase, fresh posts and commands of\nall sorts will be established, and there will be a fine career open to\nyou young fellows, in the service of the Company.\"\n\nAfter rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the ship encountered a series of\nvery heavy gales, which drove her far out of her course up the eastern\ncoast of Africa. In the last gale her foremast was carried away, and\nshe put in to a small island to refit. She had also sprung a leak, and\na number of stores were landed, to enable her to be taken up into\nshallow water and heeled over, in order that the leak might be got at.\n\nThe captain hurried on the work with all speed.\n\n\"Had it not been for this,\" Charlie heard him say to Mr. Ashmead, \"I\nwould have rigged a jury-mast and proceeded; but I can't stop the leak\nfrom the inside, without shifting a great portion of the cargo, and\nour hold is so full that this would be difficult in the extreme. But I\nown that I do not like delaying a day longer than necessary, here. The\nnatives have a very bad reputation, besides which it is suspected that\none, if not more, pirates have their rendezvous in these seas. Several\nof our merchantmen have mysteriously disappeared, without any gale\nhaving taken place which would account for their loss.\n\n\"The captain of a ship which reached England, two or three days before\nwe sailed, brought news that when she was within a fortnight's sail of\nthe Cape, the sound of guns was heard one night, and that afterwards a\nship was seen on fire, low down on the horizon. He reached the spot\nsoon after daybreak, and found charred spars and other wreckage; but\nthough he cruised about all day, he could find no signs of any boats.\nComplaints have been made to government, and I hear that there is an\nintention of sending two or three sloops out here to hunt the pirates\nup. But that will be of no use to us.\"\n\nUpon the day of their arrival at the island, a native sailing boat was\nseen to pass across the mouth of the bay. When half across, she\nsuddenly tacked round and sailed back in the direction from which she\nhad come.\n\nBefore proceeding to lighten the ship, the captain had taken steps to\nput himself in a position of defence. For some distance along the\ncentre of the bay the ground rose abruptly, at a distance of some\nthirty yards from the shore, forming a sort of natural terrace. Behind\nthis a steep hill rose. The terrace, which was forty feet above the\nwater level, extended for about a hundred yards, when the ground on\neither side of the plateau dropped away, as steeply as in front.\n\nThe guns were the first things taken out of the ship, and, regardless\nof the remonstrances of the passengers at what they considered to be a\nwaste of time, Captain Thompson had the whole of them taken up on the\nterrace. A small battery was thrown up by the sailors, at the two\ncorners, and in each of these two of the thirty-two pounders were\nplaced. The broadside guns were ranged in line along the centre of the\nterrace.\n\n\"Now,\" the captain said when, at the end of the second day, the\npreparations were completed by the transport of a quantity of\nammunition from the ship's magazine to the terrace, \"I feel\ncomfortable. We can defend ourselves here against all the pirates of\nthe South Seas. If they don't come, we shall only have lost our two\ndays' work, and shall have easy minds for the remainder of our stay\nhere; which we should not have had, if we had been at the mercy of the\nfirst of those scoundrels who happened to hear of our being laid up.\"\n\nThe next morning the work of unloading the ship began, the bales and\npackages being lowered from the ship, as they were brought up from the\nhold, into boats alongside; and then taken to the shore, and piled\nthere at the foot of the slope. This occupied three days, and at the\nend of that time the greater portion of the cargo had been removed.\nThe ship, now several feet lighter in the water than before, was\nbrought broadside to shore until her keel touched the ground. Then the\nremaining cargo was shifted, and by the additional aid of tackle and\npurchases on shore fastened to her masts, she was heeled over until\nher keel nearly reached the level of the water.\n\nIt was late one evening when this work was finished, and the following\nmorning the crew were to begin to scrape her bottom, and the\ncarpenters were to repair the leak, and the whole of the seams\nunderwater were to be corked and repitched. Hitherto all had remained\non board; but previous to the ship being heeled over, tents\nconstructed of the sails were erected on the terrace, beds and other\narticles of necessity landed, and the passengers, troops, and crew\ntook up their temporary abode there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. The Pirates Of The Pacific.\n\n\nA regular watch was set, both on the plateau and on board ship.\nTowards morning, one of the watch on board hailed the officer above:\n\n\"I have fancied, sir, for some time, that I heard noises. It seems to\nme like the splash of a very large number of oars.\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing,\" the officer said; \"but you might hear sounds\ndown there, coming along on the water, before I do. I will go down to\nthe water's edge, and listen.\"\n\nHe did so, and was at once convinced that the man's ears had not\ndeceived him. Although the night was perfectly still, and not a breath\nof wind was stirring, he heard a low rustling sound, like that of the\nwind passing through the dried leaves of a forest, in autumn.\n\n\"You are right, Johnson, there is something going on out at sea,\nbeyond the mouth of the bay. I will call the captain, at once.\"\n\nCaptain Thompson, on being aroused, also went down to the waterside to\nlisten; and at once ordered the whole party to get under arms. He\nrequested Mr. Barlow, the young lieutenant in charge of the troops, to\nplace half his men across each end of the plateau. The back was\ndefended by a cliff, which rose almost perpendicularly from it to a\nheight of some hundred feet; the plateau being some thirty yards, in\ndepth, from the sea face to its foot. The male passengers were\nrequested to divide themselves into two parties, and to join the\nsoldiers in defending the position against flank attacks. The guns\nwere all loaded, and the sailors then set to work dragging up bales of\ngoods from below, and placing them so as to form a sort of breastwork\nbefore the guns along the sea face.\n\nThe noise at sea had, by this time, greatly increased; and although it\nwas still too dark to see what was passing, Captain Thompson said that\nhe had no doubt, whatever, that the boats had one or more large ships\nin tow.\n\n\"Had it not been for that,\" he said, \"they would long ago have been\nhere. I expect that they hoped to catch us napping, but the wind fell\nand delayed them. They little dream how well we are prepared. Did they\nknow of our fort here, I question whether they would have ventured\nupon attacking us at all, but would have waited till we were well at\nsea, and then our chance would have been a slight one.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, you will allow that the two days were not wasted. I\nthink, now, the pirates are well inside the bay. In half an hour we\nshall have light enough to see them.\n\n\"There, listen! There's the splash of their anchors. There, again! I\nfancy there are two ships moored broadside on, stem and stern.\"\n\nAll this time, the work on shore had been conducted in absolute\nsilence, and the pirates could have had no intimation that their\npresence was discovered. Presently, against the faintly dawning light\nin the east, the masts of two vessels could be seen. One was a large\nship, the other a brig. Almost at the same time the rough sound of\nboats' keels grounding on the shore could be heard.\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" the captain whispered. \"They have guessed that\nsome of us will be ashore, and will make a rush upon us here, when the\nships open fire.\"\n\nThe word was passed along the guns that every one was to be double\nshotted, and that their fire was at first to be directed at the brig.\nThey were to aim between wind and water, and strive to sink her as\nspeedily as possible.\n\nAs the light gradually grew brighter, the party on the plateau\nanxiously watched for the moment when the hull of the Indiaman\nbecoming plain to the enemy. These would open fire upon it, and so\ngive the signal for the fight. At the first alarm the tents had all\nbeen levelled; and a thick barricade of bales erected, round a slight\ndepression of the plateau at the foot of the cliff in its rear. Here\nthe ladies were placed, for shelter.\n\nAs the light increased, it could be seen that in addition to the two\nships were a large number of native dhows. Presently, from the black\nside of the ship, a jet of fire shot out; and at the signal a\nbroadside was poured into the Indiaman by the two vessels. At the same\nmoment, with a hideous yell, hundreds of black figures leaped to their\nfeet on the beach, and rushed towards the, as yet, unseen position of\nthe English.\n\nThe captain shouted \"Fire!\" and the twenty guns on the plateau poured\ntheir fire simultaneously into the side of the brig. The captain then\ngave orders that two of the light guns should be run along the\nterrace, to take position on the flanks, and aid the soldiers against\nthe attacks.\n\nThis time Charlie had lent his rifle to Peters, and was himself armed\nwith his double-barrel gun.\n\n\"Steady, boys,\" Mr. Hallam, the ensign who commanded the soldiers at\nthe side where Charlie was stationed, cried; \"don't fire a shot till I\ngive the word, and then aim low.\"\n\nWith terrific yells the throng of natives, waving curved swords,\nspears, and clubs, rushed forward. The steep ascent checked them, but\nthey rushed up until within ten yards of the line of soldiers on its\nbrow. Then Mr. Hallam gave the word to fire, and the soldiers and\npassengers poured a withering volley into them.\n\nAt so short a distance, the effect was tremendous. Completely swept\naway, the leading rank fell down among their comrades; and these, for\na moment, recoiled. Then gathering themselves together they again\nrushed forward, while those in their rear discharged volleys of arrows\nover their heads.\n\nAmong the defenders, every man now fought for himself, loading and\nfiring as rapidly as possible. Sometimes the natives nearly gained a\nfooting on the crest; but each time the defenders, with clubbed\nmuskets, beat them back again.\n\nThe combat was, however, doubtful, for their assailants were many\nhundred strong; when the defenders were gladdened with a shout of\n\"Make way, my hearties. Let us come to the front, and give them a\ndose.\" In a moment two ship's guns, loaded to the muzzle with bullets,\nwere run forward, and poured their contents among the crowded masses\nbelow.\n\nThe effect was decisive. The natives, shaken by the resistance they\nhad already experienced, and appalled by the destruction wrought by\nthe cannon, turned and fled along the shore, followed by the shots of\nthe defenders, and by two more rounds of grape, which the sailors\npoured into them before they could reach their boats.\n\nSimilar success had attended the defenders of the other flank of the\nposition, and all hands now aided in swinging round the guns, which\nhad done such good service, to enable them to bear their share in the\nfight with the ships. In the middle of the fight, the party had heard\na great cheer from those working the seaward guns, and they now saw\nits cause. The brig had disappeared below the water, and the sailors\nwere now engaged in a contest with the ship.\n\nThe pirates fought their guns well, but they were altogether over\nmatched by the twenty guns playing upon them from a commanding\nposition. Already the dhows were hoisting their sails, and one of the\ncables of the ship suddenly disappeared in the water, while a number\nof men sprang upon the ratlines.\n\n\"Fire at the masts,\" Captain Thompson shouted. \"Cripple her if you\ncan. Let all with muskets and rifles try to keep men out of the\nrigging.\"\n\nThe ship was anchored within three hundred yards of the shore, and\nalthough the distance was too great for anything like accurate fire,\nseveral of the men dropped as they ran up the shroud. The sailors\nworked their guns with redoubled vigour, and a great shout arose as\nthe mainmast, wounded in several places, fell over the side.\n\n\"Sweep her decks with grape,\" the captain shouted, \"and she's ours.\n\n\"Mr. James, take all the men that can be spared from the guns, man the\nboats, and make a dash for the ship at once. I see the men are leaving\nher. They're crowding over the side into their boats. Most likely\nthey'll set fire to her. Set all your strength putting it out. We will\nattend to the other boats.\"\n\nIt was evident, now, that the pirates were deserting the ship. They\nhad fallen into a complete trap, and instead of the easy prey on which\nthey calculated, found themselves crushed by the fire of a heavy\nbattery in a commanding position. Captain Thompson, seeing that the\nguns of the ship were silent, and that all resistance had ceased, now\nordered the sailors to turn their guns on the dhows and sink as many\nas possible. These, crowded together in their efforts to escape,\noffered an easy mark for the gunners, whose shot tore through their\nsides, smashing and sinking them in all directions.\n\nIn ten minutes the last of those that floated had gained the mouth of\nthe bay and, accompanied by the boats, crowded with the crews of the\ntwo pirate vessels, made off; followed by the shot of the thirty-two\npounders, until they had turned the low promontory which formed the\nhead of the bay. Long ere this Mr. James and the boats' crews had\ngained the vessel, and were engaged in combating the fire, which had\nbroken out in three places.\n\nThe boats were sent back to shore, and returned with Captain Thompson\nand the rest of the sailors, and this reinforcement soon enabled them\nto get the mastery of the flames. The ship was found to be the Dover\nCastle, a new and very fast ship of the Company's service, of which\nall traces had been lost since she left Bombay two years before. She\nwas now painted entirely black, and a snake had been added for her\nfigurehead. The original name, however, still remained upon the\nbinnacle and ship's bell. Her former armament had been increased and\nshe now carried thirty guns, of which ten were thirty-two pounders.\n\nA subsequent search showed that her hold was stored with valuable\ngoods; which had, by the marks upon the bales, evidently belonged to\nseveral ships; which she had, no doubt, taken and sunk after removing\nthe pick of their cargoes. The prize was a most valuable one, and the\ncaptain felt that the board of directors would be highly delighted at\nthe recovery of their ship, and still more by the destruction of the\ntwo bands of pirates.\n\nThe deck of the ship was thickly strewn with dead. Among them was the\nbody of a man who, by his dress, was evidently the captain. From some\nof the pirates who still lived, Captain Thompson learned that the brig\nwas the original pirate, that she had captured the Dover Castle, that\nfrom her and subsequent prizes they had obtained sufficient hands to\nman both ships, all who refused to join being compelled to walk the\nplank. These were the only two pirate ships in those seas, so far as\nthe men knew. Their rendezvous was at a large native town on the\nmainland, at the mouth of a river three days' sail distant.\n\nThe news of the Indiaman being laid up, refitting at the island, was\nbrought by the native craft they had seen on the day after their\narrival; and upon its being known, the natives had insisted in joining\nin the attack. The pirate captain, whose interest it was to keep well\nwith them, could not refuse to allow them to join, although he would\ngladly have dispensed with their aid, believing his own force to be\nfar more than sufficient to capture the vessel, which he supposed to\nbe lying an easy prize at his hands.\n\nAnother ten days were spent in getting the cargo and guns on board the\nLizzie Anderson, and in fitting out both ships for sea. Then, Mr.\nJames and a portion of the crew being placed on board the prize, they\nsailed together for India. The Dover Castle proved to be much the\nfaster sailer, but Captain Thompson ordered her to reduce sail, and to\nkeep about a mile in his wake, as she could at any time close up when\nnecessary; and the two, together, would be able to oppose a determined\nfront, even to a French frigate, should they meet with one on their\nway.\n\nThe voyage passed without incident save that, when rounding the\nsouthern point of Ceylon, a sudden squall from the land struck them.\nThe vessel heeled over suddenly, and a young soldier, who was sitting\non the bulwarks to leeward, was jerked backwards and fell into the\nwater.\n\nCharlie Marryat was on the quarterdeck, leaning against the rail,\nwatching a shoal of flying fish passing at a short distance. In the\nnoise and confusion, caused by the sudden squall, the creaking of\ncordage, the flapping of sails, and the shouts of the officer to let\ngo the sheets, the fall of the soldier was unnoticed; and Charlie was\nstartled by perceiving, in the water below him, the figure of a\nstruggling man.\n\nHe saw, at once, that he was unable to swim. Without an instant's\nhesitation Charlie threw off his coat, and kicked off his shoes, and\nwith a loud shout of \"Man overboard!\" sprang from the taffrail and,\nwith a few vigorous strokes, was alongside the drowning man. He seized\nhim by the collar, and held him at a distance.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"don't struggle, else I'll let you go. Keep quiet, and\nI can hold you up till we're picked up.\"\n\nIn spite of the injunction, the man strove to grasp him; but Charlie\nat once let go his hold, and swam a pace back as the man sunk. When he\ncame up he seized him again, and again shouted:\n\n\"Keep quite quiet, else I'll leave go.\"\n\nThis time the soldier obeyed him and, turning him on his back, and\nkeeping his face above water, Charlie looked around at the vessel he\nhad left.\n\nThe Indiaman was still in confusion. The squall had been sudden and\nstrong. The sheets had been let go, the canvas was flapping in the\nwind, and the hands were aloft reducing sail. She was already some\ndistance away from him. The sky was bright and clear, and Charlie, who\nwas surprised at seeing no attempt to lower a boat, saw a signal run\nup to the masthead.\n\nLooking the other way, he saw at once why no boat had been lowered.\nThe Dover Castle was but a quarter of a mile astern. Carrying less\nsail than her consort, she had been better prepared for the squall,\nand was running down upon him at a great rate.\n\nA moment later a boat was swung out on davits, and several men climbed\ninto it. The vessel kept on her course, until scarcely more than her\nown length away. Then she suddenly rounded up into the wind, and the\nboat was let fall, and rowed rapidly towards him.\n\nAll this time, Charlie had made no effort beyond what was necessary to\nkeep his own head, and his companion's face, above the water. He now\nlifted the soldier's head up, and shouted to him that aid was at hand.\nIn another minute they were dragged into the boat. This was soon\nalongside the ship, and three minutes later the Dover Castle was\npursuing her course, in the track of the Lizzie Anderson, having\nsignalled that the pair had been rescued.\n\nCharlie found that the soldier was an Irish lad, of some nineteen\nyears old. His name, he said, was Tim Kelly, and as soon as he had\nrecovered himself sufficiently to speak, he was profuse in his\nprofessions of gratitude to his preserver. Tim, like the majority of\nthe recruits in the Company's service, had been enlisted while in a\nstate of drunkenness; had been hurried on board a guard ship, where,\nwhen he recovered, he found a number of other unfortunates like\nhimself. He had not been permitted to communicate with his friends on\nshore, but had been kept in close confinement, until he had been put\nin uniform and conveyed on board the Lizzie Anderson, half an hour\nbefore she sailed.\n\nThe Company's service was not a popular one. There was no fighting in\nIndia, and neither honor, glory, nor promotion to be won. The climate\nwas unsuited to Europeans, and few, indeed, of those who sailed from\nEngland as soldiers in the Company's service ever returned. The\nCompany, then, were driven to all sorts of straits to keep up even the\nsmall force which they then maintained in India, and their recruiting\nagents were, by no means, particular as to the means they employed to\nmake up the tale of recruits.\n\nThe vessels did not again communicate until they came to anchor in\nMadras roads, as the wind was fair and Captain Thompson anxious to\narrive at his destination. During these few days, Tim Kelly had\nfollowed Charlie about like a shadow. Having no duties to perform on\nboard, he asked leave to act as Charlie's servant; and Charlie was\ntouched by the efforts which the grateful fellow made to be of service\nto him.\n\nUpon their arrival they saw, to their satisfaction, that the British\nflag was waving over the low line of earthworks, which constitute the\nBritish fort. Not far from this, near the water's edge, stood the\nwhite houses and stores of the Company's factors; and behind these,\nagain, were the low hovels of the black town. The prospect was not an\ninviting one, and Charlie wondered how on earth a landing was to be\neffected, through the tremendous surf which broke upon the shore.\n\nHe soon found that, until the wind went down and the surf moderated\nsomewhat, no communication could be effected. The next morning,\nhowever, the wind lulled, and a crowd of curious native boats were\nseen putting off from the shore.\n\nCharlie had, after the vessel anchored, rejoined his ship with Tim\nKelly, and he now bade goodbye to all on board; for only the doctor,\ntwo civilians, and the troops were destined for Madras; all the rest\ngoing on in the ship to Calcutta, after she had discharged that\nportion of her cargo intended for Madras. Charlie had, during the last\ntwelve hours, been made a great deal of, on account of the gallantry\nhe had displayed in risking his life for that of the soldier. Peters\nand one of the other young writers were also to land; and, taking his\nseat with these in a native boat, paddled by twelve canoe men, he\nstarted for the shore.\n\nAs they approached the line of surf, Charlie fairly held his breath;\nfor it seemed impossible that the boat could live through it. The\nboatmen, however, ceased rowing outside the line of broken water, and\nlay on their paddles for three or four minutes.\n\nAt last a wave, larger than any of its predecessors, was seen\napproaching. As it passed under them, the steersman gave a shout. In\nan instant the rowers struck their paddles into the water, and the\nboat dashed along, with the speed of a racehorse, on the crest of the\nwave. There was a crash. For a moment the boat seemed, to the lads,\nengulfed in white foam; and then she ran high up upon the beach. The\nrowers seized the boys and, leaping out, carried them beyond the reach\nof the water, before the next wave broke upon them; and then\ntriumphantly demanded a present, for their skilful management. This\nthe lads were glad to give, for they considered that their escape had\nbeen something miraculous.\n\nFor a while they stood on the shore, watching other boats, with the\nsoldiers and baggage, coming ashore; and then, being accosted by a\ngentleman in the employment of the Company, followed him to the\nresidence of the chief factor. Here they were told that rooms would be\ngiven them, in one of the houses erected by the Company for the use of\nits employees; that they would mess with the other clerks residing in\nthe same house; and that, at nine o'clock in the morning, they would\nreport themselves as ready for work.\n\nCharlie and his friends amused themselves by sauntering about in the\nnative town, greatly surprised by the sights and scenes which met\ntheir eyes; for in those days very little was known of India, in\nEngland. They were, however, greatly disappointed. Visions of oriental\nsplendour, of palaces and temples, of superbly dressed chiefs with\nbands of gorgeous retainers, had floated before their mind's eye.\nInstead of this they saw squalid huts, men dressed merely with a rag\nof cotton around them, everywhere signs of squalor and poverty.\n\nMadras, however, they were told that evening, was not to be taken as a\nsample of India. It was a mere collection of huts, which had sprung up\nround the English factories. But when they went to a real Indian city,\nthey would see a very different state of things.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Madras.\n\n\nAfter the young writers had seen the native town, they returned to the\nbeach, and spent the afternoon watching the progress of landing the\ncargo of the Lizzie Anderson. They were pleased to see their own\nluggage safely ashore; as it would have been greatly damaged, had the\nboat containing it been swamped; a misfortune which happened to\nseveral of the boats laden with cargo. It was very amusing, each time\nthat one of these boats arrived, to see a crowd of natives rush down\ninto the water, waist deep, seize it, and drag it up beyond the next\nwave. Many of them would be knocked down, and some swept out by the\nretreating wave, only to return on the next roller. All could swim\nlike fish, and any of these events were greeted with shouts of\nlaughter by the rest.\n\nWhen the packages were landed a rope was put round them, and through\nthis a long bamboo pole was inserted, which would be lifted on to the\nshoulders of two, four, or six porters, according to its weight; and\nthese would go off, at a hobbling sort of trot, with their burden to\nthe factory.\n\nTheir own baggage was taken up to the quarters allotted to them, and\nat the hour named for dinner the newcomers met, for the first time,\nthose with whom they were to be associated. All were dressed in white\nsuits, and Charlie was struck with the pallor of their faces, and the\nlistless air of most of them. The gentleman to whom they had first\nbeen introduced made them acquainted with the others.\n\n\"How refreshingly healthy and well you look!\" a young man of some six\nand twenty years old, named Johnson, said. \"I was something like that,\nwhen I first came out here, though you'd hardly think it now. Eight\nyears of stewing, in this horrible hole, takes the life and spirits\nout of anyone.\n\n\"However, there's one consolation. After eight or ten years of quill\ndriving in a stuffy room, one becomes a little more one's own master,\nand one's duties begin to be a little more varied and pleasant. One\ngets a chance of being sent up, occasionally, with goods; or on some\nmessage or other to one of the native princes, and then one gets\ntreated like a prince, and sees that India is not necessarily so\ndetestable as we have contrived to make it here. The only bearable\ntime of one's life is the few hours after dinner, when one can sit in\na chair in the veranda, and smoke and look at the sea. Some of the\nfellows play billiards and cards; but if you will take my advice, you\nwon't go in for that sort of thing. It takes a lot out of one, and\nfellows that do it are, between you and me, in the bad books of the\nbigwigs. Besides, they lose money, get into debt, and all sorts of\nmischief comes of it.\"\n\nThe speaker was sitting between Charlie and Peters, and was talking in\na tone of voice which would not be overheard by the others.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Charlie said. \"I, for one, will certainly take your\nadvice. I suppose one can buy ponies here. I should think a good ride\nevery morning early, before work, would do one good.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is not a bad thing,\" Johnson said. \"A good many fellows do\nit, when they first come out here. But after a time they lose their\nenergy, you see, though some do keep it up.\n\n\"What appetites you fellows have! It does one good to see you eat.\"\n\n\"I have not the least idea what we are eating,\" Charlie said,\nlaughing; \"but it's really very nice, whatever it is. But there seems\nan immense quantity of pepper, or hot stuff of some kind or other;\nwhich one would have thought, in this tremendous heat, would have made\none hotter instead of cooler.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" their new friend answered. \"No doubt all this pepper and curry\ndo heat the blood; but you see, it is done to tempt the appetite. Meat\nhere is fearfully coarse and tasteless. Our appetites are poor, and\nwere it not for these hot sauces, we should eat next to nothing.\n\n\"Will you have some bananas?\"\n\n\"They are nice and cool,\" Peters said as, having peeled the long fruit\nas he saw his companion doing, he took a bite of one; \"but they have\nvery little taste.\"\n\n\"Most of our fruit is tasteless,\" Johnson said, \"except, indeed, the\nmango and mangostine. They are equal to any English fruit in flavour,\nbut I would give them all for a good English apple. Its sharpness\nwould be delicious here.\n\n\"And now, as you have done, if you will come and sit in the veranda of\nmy room, we will smoke a cigar and have something cool to drink; and I\nwill answer, as well as I can, the questions you've asked me about the\nstate of things here.\"\n\nWhen they had seated themselves in the extremely comfortable cane\nchairs, in a veranda facing the sea, and had lit their cigars, their\nfriend began:\n\n\"Madras isn't much of a place, now; but you should have seen it before\nthe French had it. Our chiefs think of nothing but trade, and care\nnothing how squalid and miserable is the place in which they make\nmoney. The French have larger ideas. They transformed this place;\ncleared away that portion of the native town which surrounded the\nfactory and fort, made wide roads, formed an esplanade, improved and\nstrengthened the fortifications, forbade the natives to throw all\ntheir rubbish and offal on the beach; and made, in fact, a decent\nplace of it. We hardly knew it when we came back, and whatever the\nCompany may have thought, we were thoroughly grateful for the French\noccupation.\n\n\"One good result, too, is that our quarters have been greatly\nimproved; for not only did the French build several new houses, but at\npresent all the big men, the council and so on, are still living at\nFort Saint David, which is still the seat of administration. So you\nsee, we have got better quarters; we are rid of the stenches and\nnuisances of the native town; the plague of flies which made our life\na burden is abated; and we can sit here and enjoy the cool sea breeze,\nwithout its being poisoned before it reaches us by the heaped up filth\non the beach.\n\n\"It must have wrung Dupleix's heart to give up the place over which\nthey expended so much pains, and after all it didn't do away with the\nfighting. In April we sent a force from Fort Saint David--before we\ncame back here--four hundred and thirty white soldiers and a thousand\nSepoys, under the command of Captain Cope, to aid a fellow who had\nbeen turned out of the Rajahship of Tanjore. I believe he was a great\nblackguard, and the man who had taken his place was an able ruler\nliked by the people.\"\n\n\"Then why should we interfere on behalf of the other?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"My dear Marryat,\" their host said compassionately, \"you are very\nyoung yet, and quite new to India. You will see, after a time, that\nright has nothing at all to do with the dealings of the Company, in\ntheir relations to the native princes. We are, at present, little\npeople living here on sufferance, among a lot of princes and powers\nwho are enemies and rivals of each other. We have, moreover, as\nneighbours, another European colony considerably stronger than we are.\nThe consequence is, the question of right cannot enter into the\nconsiderations of the Company. It may be said that, for every petty\nkingdom in Southern India, there are at least two pretenders, very\noften half a dozen. So far we have not meddled much in their quarrels,\nbut the French have been much more active that way. They always side\nwith one or other of these pretenders, and when they get the man they\nsupport into power, of course he repays them for their assistance. In\nthis manner, as I shall explain to you presently, they have virtually\nmade themselves masters of the Carnatic, outside the walls of Fort\nSaint David and this place.\n\n\"Well, our people thought to take a leaf out of the French book, and\nas the ex-rajah offered us, in payment for our aid, the possession of\nDevikota, a town at the mouth of the river Kolrun, a place likely to\nbe of great use to us, we agreed to assist him. Cope, with the land\nforces, had marched to the border of the Tanjore territory, and the\nguns and heavy baggage were to go by sea.\n\n\"But, unfortunately, we had a tremendous gale just after they sailed.\nThe admiral's flagship, the Namur, of seventy-four guns; the Pembroke,\nof sixty; and the hospital ship, Apollo, were totally lost; and the\nrest of the fleet scattered in all directions. Cope entered the\nTanjore territory, but found the whole population attached to the new\nrajah. It was useless for him, therefore, to march upon Tanjore, which\nis a really strong town, so he marched down to Devikota, where he\nhoped to find some of the fleet. Not a ship, however, was to be seen,\nand as without guns Cope could do nothing, he returned here, as we had\njust taken possession again.\n\n\"Then he went to Fort Saint David, and there was a great discussion\namong the bigwigs. It was clear, from what Cope said, that our man had\nnot a friend in his own country. Still, as he pointed out, Devikota\nwas a most important place for us. Neither Madras nor Fort Saint David\nhas a harbour; and Devikota, therefore, where the largest ships could\nrun up the river and anchor, would be of immense utility to us.\n\n\"As this was really the reason for which we had gone into the affair,\nit was decided to repeat the attempt. By this time Major Lawrence, who\ncommands the whole of the Company's forces in India, and who had been\ntaken a prisoner in one of the French sorties at the siege of\nPondicherry, had been released. So he was put at the head of the\nexpedition; and the whole of the Company's English troops, eight\nhundred in all, including the artillery; and fifteen hundred Sepoys,\nstarted on board ship for Devikota. I must tell you that Lawrence is a\nfirst-rate fellow, the only really good officer we have out here, and\nthe affair couldn't have been in the hands of a better man.\n\n\"The ships arrived safely at the mouth of the Kolrun, and the troops\nwere landed on the bank of the river opposite the town, where Lawrence\nintended to erect his batteries; as, in the first place, the shore\nbehind the town was swampy, and in the second the Rajah of Tanjore,\nwho had got news of our coming, had his army encamped there to support\nthe place. Lawrence got his guns in position and fired away, across\nthe river, at the earthen wall of the town. In three days he had a\nbreach. The enemy didn't return our fire, but occupied themselves in\nthrowing up an entrenchment across the side of the fort.\n\n\"We made a raft and crossed the river, but the enemy's matchlock men\npeppered us so severely that we lost thirty English and fifty Sepoys\nin getting over. The enemy's entrenchment was not finished, but in\nfront of it was a deep rivulet, which had to be crossed.\n\n\"Lawrence gave the command of the storming party to Clive. He is one\nof our fellows; a queer, restless sort of chap, who was really no good\nhere, for he hated his work and always seemed to think himself a\nmartyr. He was not a favourite among us, for he was often gloomy and\ndiscontented, though he had his good points. He was straightforward\nand manly, and he put down two or three fellows here, who had been\ngiven to bully the young ones, in a way that astonished them.\n\n\"He would never have made a good servant of the Company, for he so\nhated his work that, when he had been out here about a year, he tried\nto blow out his brains. He snapped the pistol twice at his head, but\nit didn't go off, though it was loaded all right. Strange, wasn't it?\nSo he came to the conclusion that he wasn't meant to kill himself, and\nwent on living till something should turn up.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Charlie said; \"Doctor Rae spoke to us about him during the\nvoyage. He knew him at the siege of Fort Saint David, and\nPondicherry.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"He came out there quite in a new light. He got\ntransferred into the military service, and was always in the middle of\nthe fighting. Major Lawrence had a very high opinion of him, and so\nselected him to lead the storming party. It really seems almost as if\nhe had a charmed life. Lawrence gave him thirty-three English\nsoldiers, and seven hundred Sepoys. The rest of the force were to\nfollow as soon as Clive's party gained the entrenchments. Clive led\nthe way with his Europeans, with the Sepoys supporting behind, and got\nacross the rivulet with a loss of only four men. He waited on the\nother bank till he saw the Sepoys climbing up, and then again led the\nEnglish on in advance towards the unfinished part of the entrenchment.\n\n\"The Sepoys, however, did not move, but remained waiting for the main\nbody to come up. The enemy let Clive and his twenty-nine men get on\nsome distance in advance, and then their cavalry, who had been hidden\nby a projection of the fort, charged suddenly down on him. They were\nupon our men before they had time to form, and in a minute twenty-six\nof them were cut to pieces. Clive and the other three managed to get\nthrough the Tanjore horsemen and rejoin the Sepoys. That was almost as\nnarrow a shave for his life as with the pistol.\n\n\"Lawrence now crossed with his main body and advanced. Again the\nTanjore horsemen charged; but this time we were prepared, and Lawrence\nlet them come on till within a few yards, and then gave them a volley\nwhich killed fourteen and sent the rest scampering away. Lawrence\npushed forward. The garrison, panic stricken at the defeat of their\ncavalry, abandoned the breach and escaped to the opposite side of the\ntown, and Devikota was ours.\n\n\"A few days later we captured the fortified temple of Uchipuran. A\nhundred men were left there, and these were afterwards attacked by the\nRajah of Tanjore, with five thousand men; but they held their own, and\nbeat them off. A very gallant business, that!\n\n\"These affairs showed the rajah that the English could fight; a point\nwhich, hitherto, the natives had been somewhat sceptical about. They\nwere afraid of the French, but they looked upon us as mere traders. He\nhad, too, other things to trouble him as to the state of the Carnatic,\nand so hastened to make peace. He agreed to pay the expenses of the\nwar, and to cede us Devikota and some territory round it; and to allow\nthe wretched ex-rajah, in whose cause we had pretended to fight, a\npension of four hundred a year, on condition that we kept him shut up\nin one of our forts.\n\n\"Not a very nice business on our side, was it? Still, we had gained\nour point, and, with the exception of the ex-rajah, who was a bad lot\nafter all, no one was discontented.\n\n\"When the peace was signed, our force returned to Fort Saint David.\nWhile they had been away, there had been a revolution in the Carnatic.\nNow this was rather a complicated business; but as the whole situation\nat present turns upon it; and it will, not improbably, cause our\nexpulsion from Southern India; I will explain it to you as well as I\ncan.\n\n\"Now you must know that all Southern India, with the exception of a\nstrip along the west coast, is governed by a viceroy, appointed by the\nemperor at Delhi. He was called the Subadar of the Deccan. Up till the\nend of 'forty-eight, Nizam Ul-Mulk was viceroy. About that time he\ndied, and the emperor appointed his grandson, Muzaffar Jung, who was\nthe son of a daughter of his, to succeed him. But the subadar had left\nfive sons. Four of these lived at Delhi, and were content to enjoy\ntheir life there. The second son, however, Nazir Jung, was an\nambitious man, who had rebelled even against his father. Naturally, he\nrebelled against his nephew.\n\n\"He was on the spot when his father died, while the new subadar was\nabsent. Nazir, therefore, seized the reins of government, and all the\nresources of the state. The emperor has troubles enough of his own at\nDelhi, and Muzaffar had no hope of aid from him. He therefore went to\nSatarah, the court of the Mahrattas, to ask for their assistance.\n\n\"There he met Chunda Sahib. This man was the nephew of the last nawab\nof the Carnatic, Dost Ali. Dost Ali had been killed in a battle with\nthem, in 1739; and they afterwards captured Trichinopoli, and took\nChunda Sahib, who commanded there, prisoner; and had since kept him at\nSatarah. Had he been at liberty he would, no doubt, have succeeded his\nuncle, whose only son had been murdered; but as he was at Satarah, the\nSubadar of the Deccan bestowed the government of the Carnatic upon\nAnwarud-din.\n\n\"Chunda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung put their heads together, and agreed\nto act in concert. Muzaffar, of course, desired the subadarship of the\nDeccan, to which he had been appointed by the court of Delhi. Chunda\nSahib wanted the nawabship of the Carnatic, and advised his ally to\nabandon his intention of asking for Mahratta aid, and to ally himself\nwith the French. A correspondence ensued with Dupleix, who, seeing the\nimmense advantage it would be to him to gain what would virtually be\nthe position of patron and protector of the Subadar of the Deccan, and\nthe Nawab of the Carnatic, at once agreed to join them.\n\n\"Muzaffar raised thirty thousand men, and Chunda Sahib six\nthousand--it is always easy, in India, to raise an army; with a\ncertain amount of money, and lavish promises--marched down and joined\na French force of four hundred strong, commanded by D'Auteuil.\n\n\"The nawab advanced against them, but was utterly defeated at Ambur,\nthe French doing pretty well the whole of the work. The nawab was\nkilled, and one of his sons, Maphuz Khan, taken prisoner. The other,\nMuhammud Ali, bolted at the beginning of the fight. Arcot, the capital\nof the Carnatic, surrendered next day.\n\n\"Muzaffar Jung proclaimed himself Subadar of the Deccan, and appointed\nChunda Sahib Nawab of the Carnatic. Muzaffar Jung conferred upon\nDupleix the sovereignty of eighty-one villages adjoining the French\nterritory. Muzaffar, after paying a visit to Pondicherry, remained in\nthe camp with his army, twenty miles distant from that place. Chunda\nSahib remained, as the guest of Dupleix, at Pondicherry.\n\n\"On the receipt of the news of the battle of Ambur, Mr. Floyer, who is\ngovernor at Fort Saint David, sent at once to Chunda Sahib to\nacknowledge him as nawab; which, in the opinion of everyone here, was\na very foolish step. Muhammud Ali had fled to Trichinopoli, and sent\nword to Mr. Floyer that he could hold the place, and even reconquer\nthe Carnatic, if the English would assist him. I know that Admiral\nBoscawen, who was with the fleet at Fort Saint David, urged Mr. Floyer\nto do so, as it was clear that Chunda Sahib would be a mere tool in\nthe hands of the French.\n\n\"When Chunda Sahib delayed week after week at Pondicherry, Mr. Floyer\nbegan to hesitate, but he could not make up his mind, and Admiral\nBoscawen, who had received orders to return home, could no longer act\nin contravention to them, and was obliged to sail.\n\n\"The instant the fleet had left, and we remained virtually\ndefenceless, Chunda Sahib, supplied with troops and money by Dupleix,\nmarched out from Pondicherry and joined Muzaffar Jung, with the avowed\nintention of marching upon Trichinopoli. Had he done this at once, he\nmust have taken the place, and it was a question of weeks and days\nonly of our being turned altogether out of Southern India. Nothing,\nindeed, could have saved us.\n\n\"Muzaffar Jung and Chunda Sahib, however, disregarding the plan which\nDupleix had marked out for them, resolved, before marching on\nTrichinopoli, to conquer Tanjore, which is the richest city in\nSouthern India. The rajah had, only a few weeks before, made peace\nwith us; and he now sent messengers to Nazir Jung, Muzaffar's rival in\nthe Deccan, and to the English, imploring their assistance. Both\nparties resolved at once to grant it, for alone both must have been\noverwhelmed by the alliance between the two Indian princes and the\nFrench; and their only hope of a successful resistance to this\ncombination was in saving Trichinopoli.\n\n\"The march of these allies upon Tanjore opened the road to\nTrichinopoli; and Captain Cope, with a hundred and twenty men, were at\nonce despatched to reinforce Muhammud Ali's garrison. Of this little\nforce, he sent off twenty men to the aid of the Rajah of Tanjore, and\nthese, under cover of the night, passed through the lines of the\nbesiegers and into the city, which was strongly fortified and able to\nstand a long siege.\n\n\"The English at once entered into a treaty with Nazir Jung, promising\nhim six hundred English troops; to assist him in maintaining his\nsovereignty of the Deccan, and in aiding to place Muhammud Ali in the\nnawabship of the Carnatic.\n\n\"Tanjore held out bravely. For some weeks the rajah had thrown dust in\nthe eyes of Chunda Sahib, by pretending to negotiate. Then, when the\nallies attacked, he defended the city for fifty-two days, at the end\nof which one of the gates of the town had been captured, and the city\nwas virtually at the mercy of the besiegers. He again delayed them by\nentering into negotiations for surrender. In vain Dupleix continued to\nurge Chunda Sahib to act energetically, and to enter Tanjore.\n\n\"Chunda Sahib, however, although he has a good head for planning, is\nirresolute in action. His troops were discontented at the want of pay.\nThe French contingent also was demoralized, from the same cause. The\ntroops feared to engage in a desperate struggle, in the streets of a\ntown abounding with palaces, each of which was virtually a fortress;\nespecially as it was known that Nazir Jung was marching, with all\nspeed, to fall upon their rear. So at last the siege was broken up,\nand the army fell back upon Pondicherry.\n\n\"Meanwhile Cope's detachment of a hundred men, with six thousand\nnative horsemen, escorted Muhammud Ali to join Nazir Jung at Valdaur,\nfifteen miles from Pondicherry. Lawrence was busy at work at Fort\nSaint David, organizing a force to go to his aid. Dupleix saw that it\nwas necessary to aid his allies energetically. The army, on its return\nfrom the siege of Tanjore, was reorganized; the French contingent\nincreased to two thousand men; and a supply of money furnished, from\nhis private means.\n\n\"The army set out to attack Nazir Jung and his ally at Valdaur. When\nthe battle began, however, the French contingent mutinied and refused\nto fight; and the natives, panic stricken by the desertion of their\nallies, fell back on Pondicherry. Chunda Sahib accompanied his men.\nMuzaffar Jung surrendered to his uncle, the usurper.\n\n\"In three or four days the discipline of the French army was restored,\nand on the 13th of April it attacked and defeated a detachment of\nNazir Jung's army; and a few days later captured the strong temple of\nTiruvadi, sixteen miles from Fort Saint David.\n\n\"Some months passed before the French were completely prepared; but on\nSeptember the first, D'Auteuil, who commanded the French, and Chunda\nSahib attacked the army of the native princes, twenty thousand strong,\nand defeated it utterly, the French not losing a single man. Muhammud\nAli, with only two attendants, fled to Arcot, and the victory rendered\nChunda Sahib virtual master of the Carnatic.\n\n\"Muzaffar Jung, after his surrender to his uncle, had been loaded with\nchains, and remained a prisoner in the camp; where, however, he\nmanaged to win over several of the leaders of his uncle's army. Gingee\nwas stormed by a small French force, and the French officer there\nentered into a correspondence with the conspirators, and it was\narranged that, when the French army attacked Nazir Jung, these should\ndeclare against him.\n\n\"On the 15th December the French commander, with eight hundred\nEuropeans, three thousand Sepoys, and ten guns, marched against Nazir\nJung, whose army of twenty-five thousand men opposed him. These,\nhowever, he defeated easily. While the battle was going on, the\nconspirators murdered Nazir Jung, released Muzaffar Jung, and saluted\nhim as subadar. His escape was a fortunate one, for his uncle had\nordered him to be executed that very day.\n\n\"Muzaffar Jung proceeded to Pondicherry, where he was received with\ngreat honors. He nominated Dupleix Nawab of the Carnatic and\nneighbouring countries, with Chunda Sahib as his deputy, conferred the\nhighest dignities upon him, and granted the French possession of all\nthe lands and forts they had conquered. He arranged with Dupleix a\nplan for common action, and agreed that a body of French troops should\nremain permanently at his capital.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. The Arrival Of Clive.\n\n\n\"I have nearly brought down the story to the present time,\" Mr.\nJohnson said. \"One event has taken place, however, which was of\nimportance. Muzaffar Jung set out for Hyderabad, accompanied by a\nFrench contingent under Bussy. On the way, the chiefs who had\nconspired against Nazir Jung mutinied against his successor. Muzaffar\ncharged them with his cavalry. Two of the three chief conspirators\nwere killed and, while pursuing the third, Muzaffar was himself\nkilled.\n\n\"Bussy at once released from confinement a son of Nazir Jung,\nproclaimed him Subadar of the Deccan, escorted him to Hyderabad, and\nreceived from him the cession of considerable fresh grants of\nterritory to the French. The latter were now everywhere triumphant,\nand Trichinopoli and Tanjore were, with the three towns held by the\nEnglish, the sole places which resisted their authority. Muhammud Ali,\ndeeming further resistance hopeless, had already opened negotiations\nwith Dupleix for the surrender of Trichinopoli. Dupleix agreed to his\nconditions; but when Muhammud Ali found that Count Bussy, with the\nflower of the French force, had been despatched to Hyderabad, he\ngained time by raising fresh demands, which would require the\nratification of the subadar.\n\n\"Luckily for us Mr. Floyer had been recalled, and his place taken by\nMr. Saunders; who is, everyone says, a man of common sense and\ndetermination. Muhammud Ali urged upon him the necessity for the\nEnglish to make common cause with him against the enemy, for if\nTrichinopoli fell, it would be absolutely impossible for the English\nto resist the French and their allies. Early this year, then, Mr.\nSaunders assured him that he should be assisted with all our strength,\nand Muhammud Ali thereupon broke off the negotiations with the French.\n\n\"Most unfortunately for us, Major Lawrence had gone home to England on\nsick leave. Captain Gingen, who now commands our troops, is a wretched\nsubstitute for him. Captain Cope is no better.\n\n\"Early this year Mr. Saunders sent Cope, with two hundred and eighty\nEnglish and three hundred Sepoys, to Trichinopoli. Benefiting by the\ndelay which was caused before Dupleix, owing to the absence of his\nbest troops at Hyderabad, could collect an army, Cope laid siege to\nMadura, but was defeated and had to abandon his guns. Three thousand\nof Muhammud Ali's native troops thereupon deserted to the enemy.\n\n\"The cause of the English now appeared lost. Dupleix planted the white\nflags, emblems of the authority of France, in the fields within sight\nof Fort Saint David. With immense efforts, Mr. Saunders put into the\nfield five hundred English troops, a thousand Sepoys, a hundred\nAfricans, and eight guns; under the command of Captain Gingen, whose\norders were to follow the movements of the army with which D'Auteuil\nand Chunda Sahib were marching against Trichinopoli.\n\n\"Luckily Chunda Sahib, instead of doing so at once, moved northwards\nto confirm his authority in the towns of North and South Arcot, and to\nraise additional levies. Great delay was caused by this. On arriving\nbefore the important fortress of Valkonda, Chunda Sahib found before\nit the troops of Captain Gingen, who had been reinforced by sixteen\nhundred troops from Trichinopoli. The governor of the place, not\nknowing which party was the stronger, refused to yield to either; and\nfor a fortnight the armies lay at a short distance from each other,\nnear the fortress, with whose governor both continued their\nnegotiations.\n\n\"Gingen then lost patience and attacked the place, but was repulsed,\nand the governor at once admitted the French within the fortress. The\nnext day the main body of the French attacked us, the guns of the\nfortress opening fire upon us at the same time. Our men, a great\nportion of whom were recruits just joined from England, fell into a\npanic and bolted, abandoning their allies and leaving their guns,\nammunition, and stores in the hands of the enemy.\n\n\"Luckily, D'Auteuil was laid up with gout. If he had pressed on, there\nremained only the two or three hundred men under Cope to offer the\nslightest resistance. Trichinopoli must have fallen at once; and we,\nwithout a hundred soldiers here, should have had nothing to do but\npack up and go. As it was, Gingen's beaten men were allowed to retreat\nquietly towards Trichinopoli.\n\n\"The next day D'Auteuil was better, and followed in pursuit, and\nGingen had the greatest difficulty in reaching Trichinopoli. There, at\nthe present moment, we lie shut up, a portion of our force only\nremaining outside the walls.\n\n\"The place itself is strong. The town lies round a lofty rock, on\nwhich stands the fortress, which commands the country for some\ndistance round. Still, there is no question that the French could take\nit, if they attacked it. Our men are utterly dispirited with defeat.\nCope and Gingen have neither enterprise nor talent.\n\n\"At present the enemy, who are now under the command of Colonel Law,\nwho has succeeded D'Auteuil, are contenting themselves with\nbeleaguering the place. But as we have no troops whatever to send to\nits rescue, and Muhammud Ali has no friends elsewhere to whom to look\nfor aid, it is a matter of absolute certainty that the place must\nfall, and then Dupleix will only have to request us to leave, and we\nshall have nothing else to do but to go at once. So I should advise\nyou not to trouble yourself to unpack your luggage, for in all\nprobability another fortnight will see us on board ship.\n\n\"There, that's a tremendous long yarn I've been telling you, and not a\npleasant one. It's a history of defeat, loss of prestige and position.\nWe have been out fought and out diplomatized, and have made a mess of\neverything we put our hand to. I should think you must be tired of it.\nI am. I haven't done so much talking, for years.\"\n\nCharlie and Peters thanked their new acquaintance, warmly, for the\npains he had taken in explaining the various circumstances and events\nwhich had led to the present unfortunate position; and Charlie asked,\nas they stood up to say goodnight to Mr. Johnson, \"What has become of\nClive, all this time?\"\n\n\"After the conquest of Devikota,\" Mr. Johnson said, \"the civilians in\nthe service were called back to their posts; but to show that they\nrecognized his services, the authorities allowed Clive to attain the\nrank of captain, which would have been bestowed upon him had he\nremained in the military service, and they appointed him commissary to\nthe army, a post which would take him away from the office work he\nhated. Almost directly afterwards, he got a bad attack of fever, and\nwas forced to take a cruise in the Bay of Bengal. He came back in time\nto go with Gingen's force; but after the defeat of Valkonda he\nresigned his office, I suppose in disgust, and returned to Fort Saint\nDavid. In July, some of the Company's ships came in with some\nreinforcements. There were no military officers left at Fort Saint\nDavid, so Mr. Pigot, a member of the council, started with a large\nconvoy of stores, escorted by eighty English and three hundred Sepoys.\nClive volunteered to accompany them. They had to march thirty or forty\nmiles to Verdachelam, a town close to the frontier of Tanjore, through\nwhich the convoy to Trichinopoli would be able to pass unopposed, but\nthe intervening country was hostile to the English.\n\n\"However, the convoy passed unmolested, and after seeing it safely to\nthat point, Pigot and Clive set out to return, with an escort of\ntwelve Sepoys. They were at once attacked, and for miles a heavy fire\nwas kept up on them. Seven of the escort were killed, the rest reached\nFort Saint David in safety. Pigot's report of Clive's conduct,\nstrengthened by that previously made by Major Lawrence, induced the\nauthorities to transfer him permanently to the army. He received a\ncommission as captain and was sent off, with a small detachment\nremaining at Saint David's, to Devikota.\n\n\"There he placed himself under Captain Clarke, who commanded; and the\nwhole body, numbering altogether a hundred English, fifty Sepoys, with\na small field piece, marched up to Trichinopoli, and I hear managed to\nmake its way in safety. He got in about a month ago.\"\n\n\"And what force have we altogether, here and at Saint David's, in case\nTrichinopoli falls?\"\n\n\"What with the detachment that came with you, and two others which\narrived about ten days back, we have altogether about three hundred\nand fifty men. What on earth could these do against all the force of\nthe nawab, the subadar, and three or four thousand French troops?\"\n\nThe prospect certainly seemed gloomy in the extreme, and the young\nwriters retired to their beds, on this, the first night of their\narrival in India, with the conviction that circumstances were in a\ndesperate position.\n\nThe next day they set to work, and at its end agreed that they should\nbear the loss of their situations, and their expulsion from the\ncountry, with more than resignation. It was now August, the heat was\nterrible, and as they sat in their shirtsleeves at their desks, bathed\nin perspiration, at their work of copying invoices, they felt that any\npossible change of circumstances would be for the better.\n\nThe next day, and the next, still further confirmed these ideas. The\nnights were nearly as hot as the days. Tormented by mosquitoes, they\ntossed restlessly in their beds for hours, dozing off towards morning\nand awaking unrefreshed and worn out. When released from work at the\nend of the third day, Charlie and Peters strolled down together to the\nbeach, and bewailed their hard fate.\n\n\"There are two ships coming from the south,\" Charlie said presently.\n\"I wonder whether they're from England, or Fort Saint David?\"\n\n\"Which do you hope they will be?\" Peters said.\n\n\"I hope they're from Saint David's,\" Charlie answered. \"Even if they\nmade a quick voyage, they couldn't have left England many weeks after\nus; and although I should be glad to get news from home, I am still\nmore anxious, just at present, for news from Saint David's. Between\nourselves, I long to hear of the fall of Trichinopoli. Everyone says\nit is certain to take place before long, and the sooner it does, the\nsooner we shall be out of this frightful place.\"\n\nAfter dinner they again went down to the beach, and were joined by\nDoctor Rae, who chatted with them as to the ships, which were now just\nanchoring. These had already signalled that they were from Saint\nDavid's, and that they had on board Mr. Saunders, the governor, and a\ndetachment of troops. Already the soldiers from the Lizzie Anderson,\naided by a number of natives, were at work pitching tents in the fort\nfor the reception of the newcomers, and conjecture was busy on shore,\namong the civilians, as to the object of bringing troops from Saint\nDavid's to Madras, that is, directly away from the scene of action.\n\n\"It is one of two things,\" Doctor Rae said: \"Either Trichinopoli has\nsurrendered and they are evacuating Fort Saint David, or they have\nnews that the nawab is marching to attack us here. I should think it\nto be the latter, for Fort Saint David is a great deal stronger than\nthis place, though the French did strengthen it during their stay\nhere. If, then, the authorities have determined to abandon one of the\ntwo towns, and to concentrate all their force for the defence of the\nother, I should have thought they would have held on to Saint David's.\n\n\"There is a boat being lowered from one of the ships, so we shall soon\nhave news.\"\n\nA signal from the ship announced that the governor was about to land,\nand the principal persons at the factory assembled on the beach to\nreceive him. Doctor Rae and the two young writers stood, a short\ndistance from the party. As the boat was beached, Mr. Saunders sprang\nout and, surrounded by those assembled to meet him, walked at once\ntowards the factory. An officer got out from the boat and\nsuperintended the debarkation of the baggage, which a number of\ncoolies at once placed on their heads and carried away.\n\nThe officer was following them, when his eye fell upon Doctor Rae.\n\n\"Ah! Doctor,\" he said, \"how are you? When did you get out again from\nEngland?\"\n\n\"Only three or four days since, Captain Clive. I did not recognize\nyou, at first. I am glad to see you again.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have cast my slough,\" Captain Clive said, laughing, \"and have,\nthank God, exchanged my pen for a sword, for good.\"\n\n\"You were able to fight, though, as a civilian,\" Doctor Rae said,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Yes, we had some tough fighting behind the ramparts of Saint David's,\nand in the trenches before Pondicherry; but we shall have sharper\nwork, still before us, or I am mistaken.\"\n\n\"What! Are they going to attack us here?\" Doctor Rae exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh no, just the other way,\" Captain Clive said. \"We are going to\ncarry the war into their quarters. It is a secret yet, and must not go\nfarther.\"\n\nAnd he included the two writers in his look.\n\n\"These are two fresh comers, Captain Clive. They came out in the same\nship with me. This is Mr. Marryat, this Mr. Peters. They are both\nbrave young gentlemen, and had an opportunity of proving it on the way\nout, for we were twice engaged; the first time with privateers; the\nsecond, a very sharp affair, with pirates. That ship lying off there\nis a pirate we captured.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" Captain Clive said, looking keenly at the lads. \"Well, young\ngentlemen, and how do you like what you have seen of your life here?\"\n\n\"We hate it, sir,\" Charlie said. \"We would, both of us, a thousand\ntimes rather enlist under you as private soldiers. Oh, sir, if there\nis any expedition going to take place, do you think there is a chance\nof our being allowed to go as volunteers?\"\n\n\"I will see about it,\" Captain Clive said, smiling. \"Trade must be\ndull enough here, at present, and we want every hand that can hold a\nsword or a musket in the field.\n\n\"You are sure you can recommend them?\" he said, turning to Doctor Rae\nwith a smile.\n\n\"Most warmly,\" the doctor said. \"They both showed great coolness and\ncourage, in the affairs I spoke of. Have you any surgeons with you,\nCaptain Clive? If not, I hope that I shall go with any expedition that\nwill take place. The doctor here is just recovering from an attack of\nfever and will not be fit, for weeks, for the fatigues of active\nservice.\n\n\"May I ask who is to command the expedition?\"\n\n\"I am,\" Clive said quietly. \"You may well look surprised that an\nofficer who has but just joined should have been selected; but in\nfact, there is no one else. Cope and Gingen are both at Trichinopoli,\nand even if they were not--\" he paused, and a shrug of the shoulders\nexpressed his meaning clearly. \"Mr. Saunders is good enough to feel\nsome confidence in my capacity, and I trust that I shall not\ndisappoint him.\n\n\"We are going--but this, mind, is a profound secret till the day we\nmarch--to attack Arcot. It is the only possible way of relieving\nTrichinopoli.\"\n\n\"To attack Arcot?\" Doctor Rae said, astonished. \"That does indeed\nappear a desperate enterprise, with such a small body as you have at\nyour command, and these, entirely new recruits. But I recognize the\nimportance of the enterprise. If you should succeed, it will draw off\nChunda Sahib from Trichinopoli. It's a grand idea, Captain Clive, a\ngrand idea, though I own it seems to me a desperate one.\"\n\n\"In desperate times we must take desperate measures, Doctor,\" Captain\nClive said. \"Now I must be going on after the governor. I shall see\nyou tomorrow.\n\n\"I will not forget you, young gentlemen.\"\n\nSo saying, he proceeded to the factory.\n\nIt was afterwards known that the proposal, to effect a diversion by an\nexpedition against Arcot, was the proposal of Clive himself. Upon\narriving at Trichinopoli, he had at once seen that all was lost,\nthere. The soldiers were utterly dispirited and demoralized. They had\nlost all confidence in themselves and their officers, who had also\nlost confidence in themselves. At Trichinopoli nothing was to be done,\nand it must be either starved out, or fall an easy prey should the\nenemy advance to the assault. Clive had, then, after a few days' stay,\nmade his way out from the town, and proceeded to Fort Saint David,\nwhere he had laid before the governor the proposal, which he believed\nto be the only possible measure which could save the English in India.\n\nThe responsibility thus set before Mr. Saunders was a grave one. Upon\nthe one hand, he was asked to detach half of the already inadequate\ngarrisons of Fort Saint David and Madras upon an enterprise which, if\nunsuccessful, must be followed by the loss of the British possessions,\nof which he was governor. He would have to take this great risk, not\nupon the advice of a tried veteran like Lawrence, but on that of a\nyoung man, only a month or two back a civilian; and it was to this\nyoung man, untried in command, that the leadership of this desperate\nenterprise must be intrusted.\n\nUpon the other hand, if he refused to take this responsibility the\nfall of Trichinopoli, followed by the loss of the three English ports,\nwas certain. But for this no blame or responsibility could rest upon\nhim. Many men would have chosen the second alternative; but Mr.\nSaunders had, since Clive's return, seen a good deal of him, and had\nbeen impressed with a strong sense of his capacity, energy, and good\nsense. Mr. Pigot, who had seen Clive under the most trying\ncircumstances, was also his warm supporter; and Mr. Saunders at last\ndetermined to adopt Clive's plan, and to stake the fortunes of the\nEnglish in India on this desperate venture.\n\nAccordingly, leaving a hundred men only at Fort Saint David, he\ndecided to carry the remainder to Madras; and that Clive, leaving only\nfifty behind as a garrison there, should, with the whole available\nforce, march upon Arcot.\n\nThe next morning as Charlie and Peters were at breakfast, a native\nentered with a letter from the chief factor, to the effect that their\nservices in the office would be dispensed with, and that they were, in\naccordance with their request, to report themselves to Captain Clive\nas volunteers. No words can express the joy of the two lads, at\nreceiving the intelligence, and they created so much noise, in the\nexuberance of their delight, that Mr. Johnson came in from the next\nroom to see what was the matter.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, when he heard the cause of the uproar; \"when I first\ncame out here, I should have done the same, and should have regarded\nthe certainty of being knocked on the head as cheerfully as you do.\nEight years out here takes the enthusiasm out of a man, and I shall\nwait quietly to see whether we are to be transferred to Calcutta, or\nshipped back to England.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later, Charlie and Peters joined Captain Clive in\nthe camp.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"My young friends, I'm glad to see you. There is plenty\nfor you to do, at once. We shall march tomorrow, and all preparations\nhave to be made. You will both have the rank of ensign, while you\nserve with me. I have only six other officers, two of whom are\ncivilians who, like yourselves, volunteered at Saint David's. They are\nof four or five year's standing and, as they speak the language, they\nwill serve with the Sepoys under one of my military officers. Another\nofficer, who is also an ensign, will take the command of the three\nguns. The Europeans are divided into two companies. One of you will be\nattached to each. The remaining officer commands both.\"\n\nDuring the day the lads had not a moment to themselves, and were\noccupied until late at night in superintending the packing of stores\nand tents; and the following morning, the 26th of August, 1751, the\nforce marched from Madras. It consisted of two hundred of the\nCompany's English troops, three hundred Sepoys, and three small guns.\nThey were led, as has been said, by eight European officers, of whom\nonly Clive and another had ever heard a shot fired in action, four of\nthe eight being young men in the civil service, who had volunteered.\n\nCharlie was glad to find that among the company to which he was\nappointed was the detachment which had come out with him on board\nship; and the moment these heard that he was to accompany them, as\ntheir officer, Tim Kelly pressed forward and begged that he might be\nallowed to act as Charlie's servant, a request which the lad readily\ncomplied with.\n\nThe march the first day was eighteen miles, a distance which, in such\na climate, was sufficient to try to the utmost the powers of the young\nrecruits. The tents were soon erected, each officer having two or\nthree native servants, that number being indispensable in India.\nCharlie and Peters had one tent between them, which was shared by two\nother officers, as the column had moved in the lightest order possible\nin India.\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Marryat,\" Tim Kelly said to him confidentially, \"that black\nhathen of a cook is going to pison ye. I have been watching him, and\nthere he is putting all sorts of outlandish things into the mate. He's\nbeen pounding them up on stones, for all the world like an apothecary,\nand even if he manes no mischief, the food isn't fit to set before a\ndog, let alone a Christian and a gintleman like yourself. If you give\nthe word, sir, I knock him over with the butt end of my musket, and do\nthe cooking for you, meself.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid the other officers wouldn't agree to that, Tim,\" Charlie\nsaid, laughing. \"The food isn't so bad as it looks, and I don't think\nan apprenticeship among the Irish bogs is likely to have turned you\nout a first rate cook, Tim; except, of course, for potatoes.\"\n\n\"Sure, now, yer honor, I can fry a rasher of bacon with any man.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you might do that, Tim, but as we've no bacon here, that\nwon't help us. No, we must put up with the cook, and I don't think any\nof us will be the worse for the dinner.\"\n\nOn the morning of the 29th Clive reached Conjeveram, a town of some\nsize, forty-two miles from Madras. Here Clive gained the first\ntrustworthy intelligence as to Arcot. He found the garrison\noutnumbered his own force by two to one; and that, although the\ndefences were not in a position to resist an attack by heavy guns,\nthey were capable of being defended against any force not so provided.\nClive at once despatched a messenger to Madras, begging that two\neighteen-pounders might be sent after him; and then, without awaiting\ntheir coming he marched forward against Arcot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. The Siege Of Arcot.\n\n\nFrom Conjeveram to Arcot is twenty-seven miles, and the troops, in\nspite of a delay caused by a tremendous storm of thunder and\nlightning, reached the town in two days. The garrison, struck with\npanic at the sudden coming of a foe, when they deemed themselves in\nabsolute security, at once abandoned the fort, which they might easily\nhave maintained until Chunda Sahib was able to send a force to relieve\nit. The city was incapable of defence after the fort had been\nabandoned, and Clive took possession of both, without firing a shot.\n\nHe at once set to work to store up provisions in the fort, in which he\nfound eight guns and an abundance of ammunition, as he foresaw the\nlikelihood of his having to stand a siege there; and then, leaving a\ngarrison to defend it in his absence, marched on the 4th of September\nwith the rest of his forces against the enemy, who had retired from\nthe town to the mud fort of Timari, six miles south of Arcot. After a\nfew discharges with their cannon they retired hastily, and Clive\nmarched back to Arcot.\n\nTwo days later, however, he found that they had been reinforced, and\nas their position threatened his line of communications, he again\nadvanced towards them. He found the enemy about two thousand strong,\ndrawn up in a grove under cover of the guns of the fort. The grove was\ninclosed by a bank and ditch, and some fifty yards away was a dry\ntank, inclosed by a bank higher than that which surrounded the grove.\nIn this the enemy could retire, when dislodged from their first\nposition.\n\nCharlie's heart beat fast when he heard the order given to advance.\nThe enemy outnumbered them by five to one, and were in a strong\nposition. As the English advanced, the enemy's two field pieces opened\nupon them. Only three men were killed, and, led by their officers, the\nmen went at the grove at the double. The enemy at once evacuated it,\nand took refuge in the tank, from behind whose high bank they opened\nfire upon the English.\n\nClive at once divided his men into two columns, and sent them round to\nattack the tank upon two sides. The movement was completely\nsuccessful. At the same moment the men went with a rush at the banks,\nand upon reaching the top opened a heavy fire upon the crowded mass\nwithin. These at once fled in disorder.\n\nClive then summoned the fort to surrender; but the commander, seeing\nthat Clive had no battering train, refused to do so; and Clive fell\nback upon Arcot again, until his eighteen-pounders should arrive.\n\nFor the next eight days, the troops were engaged in throwing up\ndefences, and strengthening and victualling the fort. The enemy,\ngaining confidence, gathered to the number of three thousand, and\nencamped three miles from the town, proclaiming that they were about\nto besiege; and at midnight on the 14th Clive sallied out, took them\nby surprise, and dispersed them.\n\nThe two eighteen-pounders, for which Clive had sent to Madras, were\nnow well upon the road, under the protection of a small body of\nSepoys, and were approaching Conjeveram. The enemy sent a considerable\nbody of troops to cut off the guns, and Clive found that the small\nnumber which he had sent out, to meet the approaching party, would not\nbe sufficient. He therefore resolved to take the whole force, leaving\nonly sufficient to garrison the fort.\n\nThe post which the enemy occupied was a temple near Conjeveram, and as\nthis was twenty-seven miles distant, the force would be obliged to be\nabsent for at least two days. As it would probably be attacked, and\nmight have to fight hard, he decided on leaving only thirty Europeans\nand fifty Sepoys within the fort. He appointed Doctor Rae to the\ncommand of the post during his absence, and placed Charlie and Peters\nunder his orders.\n\n\"I wonder whether they will have any fighting,\" Charlie said, as the\nthree officers looked from the walls of the fort after the departing\nforce.\n\n\"I wish we had gone with them,\" Peters put in; \"but it will be a long\nmarch, in the heat.\"\n\n\"I should think,\" Doctor Rae said, \"that they are sure to have\nfighting. I only hope they may not be attacked at night. The men are\nvery young and inexperienced, and there is nothing tries new soldiers\nso much as a night attack. However, from what I hear of their own\nwars, I believe that night attacks are rare among them. I don't know\nthat they have any superstition on the subject, as some African people\nhave, on the ground that evil spirits are about at night; but the\nnatives are certainly not brisk, after nightfall. They are extremely\nsusceptible to any fall of temperature, and as you have, of course,\nnoticed, sleep with their heads covered completely up. However, we\nmust keep a sharp lookout here, tonight.\"\n\n\"You don't think that we are likely to be attacked, sir, do you?\"\n\n\"It is possible we may be,\" the doctor said. \"They will know that\nCaptain Clive has set out from here, with the main body, and has left\nonly a small garrison. Of course they have spies, and will know that\nthere are only eighty men here, a number insufficient to defend one\nside of this fort, to say nothing of the whole circle of the walls.\nThey have already found out that the English can fight in the open,\nand their experience at Timari will make them shy of meeting us again.\nTherefore, it is just possible that they may be marching in this\ndirection today, while Clive is going in the other, and that they may\nintend carrying it with a rush.\n\n\"I should say, today let the men repose as much as possible; keep the\nsentries on the gates and walls, but otherwise let them all have\nabsolute quiet. You can tell the whites, and I will let the Sepoys\nknow, that they will have to be in readiness all night, and that they\nhad better, therefore, sleep as much as possible today. We will take\nit by turns to be on duty, one going round the walls and seeing that\nthe sentries are vigilant, while the others sit in the shade and doze\noff, if they can. We must all three keep on the alert, during the\nnight.\"\n\nDoctor Rae said that he, himself, would see that all went well for the\nfirst four hours, after which Charlie should go on duty; and the two\nsubalterns accordingly made themselves as comfortable as they could in\ntheir quarters, which were high up in the fort, and possessed a window\nlooking over the surrounding country.\n\n\"Well, Tim, what is the matter with you?\" they asked that soldier, as\nhe came in with an earthenware jar of water, which he placed to cool\nin the window. \"You look pale.\"\n\n\"And it's pale I feel, your honor, with the life frightened fairly out\nof me, a dozen times a day. It was bad enough on the march, but this\nplace just swarms with horrible reptiles. Shure an' it's a pity that\nthe holy Saint Patrick didn't find time to pay a visit to India. If\nhe'd driven the varmint into the sea for them, as he did in Ireland,\nthe whole population would have become Christians, out of pure\ngratitude. Why, yer honor, in the cracks and crevices of the stones of\nthis ould place there are bushels and bushels of 'em. There are things\nthey call centipades, with a million legs on each side of them, and\nhorns big enough to frighten ye; of all sizes up to as long as my hand\nand as thick as my finger; and they say that a bite from one of them\nwill put a man in a raging fever, and maybe kill him. Then there are\nscorpions, the savagest looking little bastes ye ever saw, for all the\nworld like a little lobster with his tail turned over his back, and a\nsting at the end of it. Then there's spiders, some of 'em nigh as big\nas a cat.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense, Tim!\" Charlie said; \"I don't think, from what I've\nheard, that there's a spider in India whose body is as big as a\nmouse.\"\n\n\"It isn't their body, yer honor. It's their legs. They're just cruel\nto look at. It was one of 'em that gave me a turn, a while ago. I was\njust lying on my bed smoking my pipe, when I saw one of the creatures\n(as big as a saucer, I'll take my oath) walking towards me with his\nwicked eye fixed full on me. I jumped off the bed and on to a bench\nthat stood handy.\n\n\"'What are ye yelling about, Tim Kelly?' said Corporal Jones to me.\n\n\"'Here's a riotous baste here, corporal,' says I, 'that's meditating\nan attack on me.'\n\n\"'Put your foot on it, man,' says he.\n\n\"'It's mighty fine,' says I, 'and I in my bare feet.'\n\n\"So the corporal tells Pat Murphy, my right-hand man, to tackle the\nbaste. I could see Pat didn't like the job ayther, yer honor, but he's\nnot the boy to shrink from his duty; so he comes and he takes post on\nthe form by my side, and just when the cratur is making up his mind to\ncharge us both, Pat jumps down upon him and squelched it.\n\n\"Shure, yer honor, the sight of such bastes is enough to turn a\nChristian man's blood.\"\n\n\"The spider had no idea of attacking you, Kelly,\" Peters said,\nlaughing. \"It might possibly bite you in the night, though I do not\nthink it would do so; or if you took it up in your fingers.\"\n\n\"The saints defind us, yer honor! I'd as soon think of taking a tiger\nby the tail. The corporal, he's an Englishman, and lives in a country\nwhere they've got snakes and reptiles; but it's hard on an Irish boy,\ndacently brought up within ten miles of Cork's own town, to be exposed\nto the like.\n\n\"And do ye know, yer honor, when I went out into the town yesterday,\nwhat should I see but a man sitting down against a wall, with a little\nbit of a flute in his hand, and a basket by his side. Well, yer honor,\nI thought maybe he was going to play a tune, when he lifts up the top\nof the basket and then began to play. Ye may call it music, yer honor,\nbut there was nayther tune nor music in it.\n\n\"Then all of a suddint two sarpents in the basket lifts up their\nheads, with a great ear hanging down on each side, and began to wave\nthemselves about.\"\n\n\"Well, Tim, what happened then?\" Charlie asked, struggling with his\nlaughter.\n\n\"Shure it's little I know what happened after, for I just took to my\nheels, and I never drew breath till I was inside the gates.\"\n\n\"There was nothing to be frightened at, Tim,\" Charlie said. \"It was a\nsnake charmer. I have never seen one yet, but there are numbers of\nthem all over India. Those were not ears you saw, but the hood. The\nsnakes like the music, and wave their heads about in time to it. I\nbelieve that, although they are a very poisonous snake and their bite\nis certain death, there is no need to be afraid of them, as the\ncharmers draw out their poison fangs when they catch them.\"\n\n\"Do they, now?\" Tim said, in admiration. \"I wonder what the regimental\nbarber would say to a job like that, now. He well nigh broke Dan\nSullivan's jaw, yesterday, in getting out a big tooth; and then swore\nat the poor boy, for having such a powerful strong jaw. I should like\nto see his face, if he was asked to pull out a tooth from one of them\ndancing sarpents.\n\n\"I brought ye in some fruits, yer honors. I don't know what they are,\nbut you may trust me, they're not poison. I stopped for half an hour\nbeside the stall, till I saw some of the people of the country buying\nand ating them. So then I judged that they were safe for yer honors.\"\n\n\"Now, Tim, you'd better go and lie down and get a sleep, if the\nspiders will let you, for you will have to be under arms all night, as\nit is possible that we may be attacked.\"\n\nThe first part of the night passed quietly. Double sentries were\nplaced at each of the angles of the walls. The cannons were loaded,\nand all ready for instant action. Doctor Rae and his two subalterns\nwere upon the alert, visiting the posts every quarter of an hour to\nsee that the men were vigilant.\n\nTowards two o'clock a dull sound was heard and, although nothing could\nbe seen, the men were at once called to arms, and took up the posts to\nwhich they had already been told off on the walls. The noise\ncontinued. It was slight and confused, but the natives are so quiet in\ntheir movements, that the doctor did not doubt that a considerable\nbody of men were surrounding the place, and that he was about to be\nattacked.\n\nPresently one of the sentries over the gateway perceived something\napproaching. He challenged, and immediately afterwards fired. The\nsound of his gun seemed to serve as the signal for an assault, and a\nlarge body of men rushed forward at the gate, while at two other\npoints a force ran up to the foot of the walls, and endeavoured to\nplant ladders.\n\nThe garrison at once collected at the points of attack, a few sentries\nonly being left at intervals on the wall, to give notice should any\nattempt be made elsewhere. From the walls, a heavy fire of musketry\nwas poured upon the masses below; while from the windows of all the\nhouses around, answering flashes of fire shot out, a rain of bullets\nbeing directed at the battlements. Doctor Rae himself commanded at the\ngate; one of the subalterns at each of the other points assailed.\n\nThe enemy fought with great determination. Several times the ladders\nwere planted and the men swarmed up them, but as often these were\nhurled back upon the crowd below. At the gate the assailants\nendeavoured to hew their way, with axes, through it; but so steady was\nthe fire directed, from the loopholes which commanded it, upon those\nso engaged, that they were, each time, forced to recoil with great\nslaughter. It was not until nearly daybreak that the attack ceased,\nand the assailants, finding that they could not carry the place by a\ncoup de main, fell back.\n\nThe next day, the main body of the British force returned with the\nconvoy. News arrived, the following day, that the enemy were\napproaching to lay siege to the place.\n\nThe news of the capture of Arcot had produced the effect which Clive\nhad anticipated from it. It alarmed and irritated the besiegers of\nTrichinopoli, and inspired the besieged with hope and exultation. The\nMahratta chief of Gutti and the Rajah of Mysore, with whom Muhammud\nAli had for some time been negotiating, at once declared in his\nfavour. The Rajah of Tanjore and the chief of Pudicota, adjoining that\nstate, who had hitherto remained strictly neutral, now threw in their\nfortunes with the English, and thereby secured the communications\nbetween Trichinopoli and the coast.\n\nChunda Sahib determined to lose not a moment in recovering Arcot,\nknowing that its recapture would at once cool the ardour of the new\nnative allies of the English; and that, with its capture, the last\nhope of the besieged in Trichinopoli would be at an end. Continuing\nthe siege, he despatched three thousand of his best troops, with a\nhundred and fifty Frenchmen, to reinforce the two thousand men already\nnear Arcot, under the command of his son Riza Sahib. Thus the force\nabout to attack Arcot amounted to five thousand men; while the\ngarrison under Clive's orders had, by the losses in the defence of the\nfort, by fever and disease, been reduced to one hundred and twenty\nEuropeans, and two hundred Sepoys; while four out of the eight\nofficers were hors de combat.\n\nThe fort which this handful of men had to defend was in no way capable\nof offering a prolonged resistance. Its walls were more than a mile in\ncircumference, and were in a very bad state of repair. The rampart was\nnarrow and the parapet low, and the ditch, in many places, dry. The\nfort had two gates. These were in towers standing beyond the ditch,\nand connected with the interior by a causeway across it. The houses in\nthe town in many places came close up to the walls, and from their\nroofs the ramparts of the forts were commanded.\n\nOn the 23rd September Riza Sahib, with his army, took up his position\nbefore Arcot. Their guns had not, however, arrived, with the exception\nof four mortars; but they at once occupied all the houses near the\nfort, and from the walls and upper windows kept up a heavy fire on the\nbesieged.\n\nClive determined to make an effort, at once, to drive them from this\nposition, and he accordingly, on the same afternoon, made a sortie. So\ndeadly a fire, however, was poured into the troops as they advanced,\nthat they were unable to make any way, and were forced to retreat into\nthe fort again, after suffering heavy loss.\n\nOn the night of the 24th, Charlie Marryat, with twenty men carrying\npowder, was lowered from the walls; and an attempt was made to blow up\nthe houses nearest to them; but little damage was done, for the enemy\nwere on the alert, and they were unable to place the powder in\neffective positions, and with a loss of ten of their number the\nsurvivors with difficulty regained the fort.\n\nFor the next three weeks the position remained unchanged. So heavy was\nthe fire which the enemy, from their commanding position, maintained,\nthat no one could show his head for a moment, without running the risk\nof being shot. Only a few sentinels were kept upon the walls, to\nprevent the risk of surprise, and these had to remain stooping below\nthe parapet. Every day added to the losses.\n\nCaptain Clive had a series of wonderful escapes, and indeed the men\nbegan to regard him with a sort of superstitious reverence, believing\nthat he had a charmed life. One of his three remaining officers,\nseeing an enemy taking deliberate aim at him through a window,\nendeavoured to pull him aside. The native changed his aim, and the\nofficer fell dead. On three other occasions sergeants, who accompanied\nhim on his rounds, were shot dead by his side. Yet no ball touched\nhim.\n\nProvisions had been stored in the fort, before the commencement of the\nsiege, sufficient for sixty days; and of this a third was already\nexhausted when, on the 14th of October, the French troops serving with\nRiza Sahib received two eighteen-pounders, and seven smaller pieces of\nartillery. Hitherto the besiegers had contented themselves with\nharassing the garrison night and day, abstaining from any attack which\nwould cost them lives, until the arrival of their guns. Upon receiving\nthese, they at once placed them in a battery which they had prepared\non the northwest of the fort, and opened fire.\n\nSo well was this battery placed, and so accurate the aim of its gunner,\nthat the very first shot dismounted one of the eighteen-pounders in the\nfort. The second again struck the gun and completely disabled it. The\nbesieged mounted their second heavy gun in its place, and were preparing\nto open fire on the French battery, when a shot struck it also and\ndismounted it. It was useless to attempt to replace it, and it was,\nduring the night, removed to a portion of the walls not exposed to the\nfire of the enemy's battery. The besiegers continued their fire, and in\nsix days had demolished the wall facing their battery, making a breach\nof fifty feet wide.\n\nClive, who had now only the two young subalterns serving under him,\nworked indefatigably. His coolness and confidence of bearing kept up\nthe courage of his little garrison, and every night, when darkness hid\nthem from the view of the enemy's sharpshooters, the men laboured to\nprepare for the impending attack. Works were thrown up inside the\nfort, to command the breach. Two deep trenches were dug, one behind\nthe other; the one close to the wall, the other some distance farther\nback. These trenches were filled with sharp iron three-pointed spikes,\nand palisades erected extending from the ends of the ditches to the\nramparts, and a house pulled down in the rear to the height of a\nbreastwork, behind which the garrison could fire at the assailants, as\nthey endeavoured to cross the ditches.\n\nOne of the three field pieces Clive had brought with him he mounted on\na tower, flanking the breach outside. Two he held in reserve, and\nplaced two small guns, which he had found in the fort when he took it,\non the flat roof of a house in the fort commanding the inside of the\nbreach.\n\nFrom the roofs of some of the houses around the fort the besiegers\nbeheld the progress of these defences; and Riza Sahib feared, in spite\nof his enormously superior numbers, to run the risk of a repulse. He\nknew that the amount of provisions which Clive had stored was not\nlarge, and thinking that famine would inevitably compel his surrender,\nshrank from incurring the risk of disheartening his army, by the\nslaughter which an unsuccessful attempt to carry the place must\nentail. He determined, at any rate, to increase the probability of\nsuccess, and utilize his superior forces, by making an assault at two\npoints, simultaneously. He therefore erected a battery on the\nsouthwest, and began to effect a breach on that side, also.\n\nClive, on his part, had been busy endeavouring to obtain assistance.\nHis native emissaries, penetrating the enemy's lines, carried the news\nof the situation of affairs in the fort to Madras, Fort Saint David,\nand Trichinopoli. At Madras a few fresh troops had arrived from\nEngland, and Mr. Saunders, feeling that Clive must be relieved at all\ncost, however defenceless the state of Madras might be, despatched, on\nthe 20th of October, a hundred Europeans and a hundred Sepoys, under\nLieutenant Innis. These, after three days' marching, arrived at\nTrivatoor, twenty-two miles from Arcot.\n\nRiza Sahib had heard of his approach; and sent a large body of troops,\nwith two guns, to attack him. The contest was too unequal. Had the\nBritish force been provided with field pieces, they might have gained\nthe day; but, after fighting with great bravery, they were forced to\nfall back; with a loss of twenty English and two officers killed and\nmany more wounded, while the Sepoys suffered equally severely.\n\nOne of Clive's messengers reached Murari Reo, the Mahratta chief of\nGutti. This man was a ferocious free-booting chief, daring and brave\nhimself, and admiring those qualities in others. Hitherto, his\nalliance with Muhammud Ali was little more than nominal, for he had\ndreaded bringing upon himself the vengeance of Chunda Sahib and the\nFrench, whose ultimate success in the strife appeared certain. Clive's\nmarch upon Arcot, and the heroic defence which the handful of men\nthere were opposing to overwhelming numbers, excited his highest\nadmiration. As he afterwards said, he had never before believed that\nthe English could fight, and when Clive's messenger reached him, he at\nonce sent back a promise of assistance.\n\nRiza Sahib learned, almost as soon as Clive himself, that the\nMahrattas were on the move. The prospects of his communications being\nharassed, by these daring horsemen, filled him with anxiety. Murari\nReo was encamped, with six thousand men, at a spot thirty miles to the\nwest of Arcot; and he might, at any moment, swoop down upon the\nbesiegers. Although, therefore, Riza Sahib had for six days been at\nwork effecting a new breach, which was now nearly open to assault, he\nsent on the 30th of October a flag of truce, with an offer to Clive of\nterms, if he would surrender Arcot.\n\nThe garrison were to be allowed to march out with their arms and\nbaggage, while to Clive himself he offered a large sum of money. In\ncase of refusal, he threatened to storm the fort, and put all its\ndefenders to the sword. Clive returned a defiant refusal, and the guns\nagain opened on the second breach.\n\nOn the 9th of November, the Mahrattas began to show themselves in the\nneighbourhood of the besieging army. The force under Lieutenant Innis\nhad been reinforced, and was now under the command of Captain\nKilpatrick, who had a hundred and fifty English troops, with four\nfield guns. This was now advancing.\n\nFour days later the new breach had attained a width of thirty yards,\nbut Clive had prepared defences in the rear, similar to those at the\nother breach; and the difficulties of the besiegers would here be much\ngreater, as the ditch was not fordable.\n\nThe fifty days which the siege had lasted had been terrible ones for\nthe garrison. Never daring to expose themselves unnecessarily during\nthe day, yet ever on the alert to repel an attack; labouring at night\nat the defences, with their numbers daily dwindling, and the prospect\nof an assault becoming more and more imminent, the work of the little\ngarrison was terrible; and it is to the defences of Lucknow and\nCawnpore, a hundred years later, that we must look to find a parallel,\nin English warfare, for their endurance and bravery.\n\nBoth Charlie Marryat and Peters had been wounded, but in neither case\nwere the injuries severe enough to prevent their continuing on duty.\nTim Kelly had his arm broken by a ball, while another bullet cut a\ndeep seam along his cheek, and carried away a portion of his ear. With\nhis arm in splints and a sling, and the side of his face covered with\nstrappings and plaster, he still went about his business.\n\n\"Ah! Yer honors,\" he said one day to his masters; \"I've often been out\ncatching rabbits, with ferrits to drive 'em out of their holes, and\nsticks to knock 'em on the head, as soon as they showed themselves;\nand it's a divarshun I was always mightily fond of, but I never quite\nintered into the feelings of the rabbits. Now I understand them\ncomplately, for ain't we rabbits ourselves? The officers, saving your\npresence, are the ferrits who turn us out of our holes on duty; and\nthe niggers yonder, with their muskets and their matchlocks, are the\nmen with sticks, ready to knock us on head, directly we show\nourselves. If it plase Heaven that I ever return to the ould country\nagain, I'll niver lend a hand at rabbiting, to my dying day.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. The Grand Assault.\n\n\nThe 14th of November was a Mohammedan festival, and Riza Sahib\ndetermined to utilize the enthusiasm and fanatic zeal, which such an\noccasion always excites among the followers of the Prophet, to make\nhis grand assault upon Arcot, and to attack at three o'clock in the\nmorning. Every preparation was made on the preceding day, and four\nstrong columns told off for the assault. Two of these were to attack\nby the breaches, the other two at the gates. Rafts were prepared to\nenable the party attacking by the new breach to cross the moat, while\nthe columns advancing against the gates were to be preceded by\nelephants, who, with iron plates on their foreheads, were to charge\nand batter down the gates.\n\nClive's spies brought him news of the intended assault, and at\nmidnight he learned full particulars as to the disposition of the\nenemy. His force was now reduced to eighty Europeans, and a hundred\nand twenty Sepoys. Every man was told off to his post, and then,\nsentries being posted to arouse them at the approach of the enemy, the\nlittle garrison lay down in their places, to get two or three hours'\nsleep before the expected attack.\n\nAt three o'clock, the firing of three shells from the mortars into the\nfort gave the signal for assault. The men leaped up and stood to their\narms, full of confidence in their ability to resist the attack. Soon\nthe shouts of the advancing columns testified to the equal confidence\nand ardour of the assailants.\n\nNot a sound was heard within the walls of the fort, until the\nelephants advanced towards the gates. Then suddenly a stream of fire\nleaped out from loophole and battlement. So well directed and\ncontinuous was the fire, that the elephants, dismayed at the outburst\nof fire and noise, and smarting from innumerable wounds, turned and\ndashed away, trampling in their flight multitudes of men in the dense\ncolumns packed behind them. These, deprived of the means upon which\nthey had relied to break in the gates, turned and retreated rapidly.\n\nScarcely less prolonged was the struggle at the breaches. At the first\nbreach, a very strong force of the enemy marched resolutely forward.\nThey were permitted, without a shot being fired at them, to cross the\ndry ditch, mount the shattered debris of the wall, and pour into the\ninterior of the fort. Forward they advanced until, without a check,\nthey reached the first trench bristling with spikes.\n\nThen, as they paused for a moment, from the breastwork in front of\nthem, from the ramparts, and every spot which commanded the trench, a\nstorm of musketry was poured on them; while the gunners swept the\ncrowded mass with grape, and bags of bullets. The effect was\ntremendous. Mowed down in heaps, the assailants recoiled; and then,\nwithout a moment's hesitation, turned and fled. Three times, strongly\nreinforced, they advanced to the attack; but were each time repulsed,\nwith severe slaughter.\n\nStill less successful were those at the other breach. A great raft,\ncapable of carrying seventy, conveyed the head of the storming party\nacross the ditch; and they had just reached the foot of the breach,\nwhen Clive, who was himself at this point, turned two field pieces\nupon them, with deadly effect. The raft was upset and smashed, and the\ncolumn, deprived of its intended means of crossing the ditch, desisted\nfrom the attack.\n\nAmong those who had fallen, at the great breach, was the commander of\nthe storming party; a man of great valour. Four hundred of his\nfollowers had also been killed, and Riza Sahib, utterly disheartened\nat his repulse at all points, decided not to renew the attack. He had\nstill more than twenty men to each of the defenders; but the obstinacy\nof their resistance, and the moral effect produced by it upon his\ntroops; the knowledge that the Mahratta horse were hovering in his\nrear, and that Kilpatrick's little column was close at hand;\ndetermined him to raise the siege.\n\nAfter the repulse of the assault, the heavy musketry fire from the\nhouses around the fort was continued. At two in the afternoon he asked\nfor two hours' truce, to bury the dead. This was granted, and on its\nconclusion the musketry fire was resumed, and continued until two in\nthe morning. Then suddenly, it ceased. Under cover of the fire, Riza\nSahib had raised the siege, and retired with his army to Vellore.\n\nOn the morning of the 15th, Clive discovered that the enemy had\ndisappeared. The joy of the garrison was immense. Every man felt\nproud, and happy in the thought that he had taken his share in a\nsiege, which would not only be memorable in English history till the\nend of time, but which had literally saved India to us. The little\nband made the fort re-echo with their cheers, when the news came in.\nCaps were thrown high in the air, and the men indulged in every\ndemonstration of delight.\n\nClive was not a man to lose time. The men were at once formed up, and\nmarched into the abandoned camp of the enemy; where they found four\nguns, four mortars, and a great quantity of ammunition. A cloud of\ndust was seen approaching, and soon a mounted officer, riding forward,\nannounced the arrival of Captain Kilpatrick's detachment.\n\nNot a moment was lost, for Clive felt the importance of, at once,\nfollowing up the blow inflicted by the repulse of the enemy. Three\ndays were spent, in continuous labour, in putting the fort of Arcot\nagain in a position of defence; and, leaving Kilpatrick in charge\nthere, he marched out with two hundred Europeans, seven hundred\nSepoys, and three guns, and attacked and took Timari, the little fort\nwhich before baffled him.\n\nThis done, he returned towards Arcot to await the arrival of a\nthousand Mahratta horse, which Murari Reo had promised him. When these\narrived, however, they proved unwilling to accompany him. Upon their\nway, they had fallen in with a portion of Riza Sahib's retreating\nforce, and had been worsted in the attack; and as the chance of\nplunder seemed small, while the prospect of hard blows was certain,\nthe free-booting horsemen refused, absolutely, to join in the pursuit\nof the retreating enemy.\n\nJust at this moment, the news came in that reinforcements from\nPondicherry were marching to meet Riza Sahib at Arni, a place\nseventeen miles south of Arcot, twenty south of Vellore. It was stated\nthat, with these reinforcements, a large sum of money was being\nbrought, for the use of Riza Sahib's army. When the Mahrattas heard\nthe news, the chance of booty at once altered their intentions, and\nthey declared themselves ready to follow Clive. The greater portion of\nthem, however, had dispersed, plundering over the country, and great\ndelay was caused before they could be collected. When six hundred of\nthem had been brought together, Clive determined to wait no longer,\nbut started at once for Arni.\n\nThe delay enabled Riza Sahib, marching down from Vellore, to meet his\nreinforcements; and when Clive, after a forced march of twenty miles,\napproached Arni, he found the enemy, composed of three hundred French\ntroops, two thousand five hundred Sepoys, and two thousand horsemen,\nwith four guns, drawn up before it. Seeing their immense superiority\nin numbers, these advanced to the attack.\n\nClive determined to await them where he stood. The position was an\nadvantageous one. He occupied a space of open ground, some three\nhundred yards in width. On his right flank was a village, on the left\na grove of palm trees. In front of the ground he occupied were rice\nfields, which, it being the wet season, were very swampy, and\naltogether impracticable for guns. These fields were crossed by a\ncauseway which led to the village, but as it ran at an angle across\nthem, those advancing upon it were exposed to the fire of the English\nfront. Clive posted the Sepoys in the village, the Mahratta horsemen\nin the grove, and the two hundred English, with the guns, on the\nground between them.\n\nThe enemy advanced at once. His native cavalry, with some infantry,\nmarched against the grove; while the French troops, with about fifteen\nhundred infantry, moved along the causeway against the village.\n\nThe fight began on the English left. There the Mahratta cavalry fought\nbravely. Issuing from the palm grove, they made repeated charges\nagainst the greatly superior forces of the enemy. But numbers told,\nand the Mahrattas, fighting fiercely, were driven back into the palm\ngrove; where they, with difficulty, maintained themselves.\n\nIn the meantime, the fight was going on at the centre. Clive opened\nfire with his guns on the long column marching, almost across his\nfront, to attack the village. The enemy, finding themselves exposed to\na fire which they were powerless to answer, quitted the causeway, and\nformed up in the rice fields fronting the English position. The guns,\nprotected only by a few Frenchmen and natives, remained on the\ncauseway.\n\nClive now despatched two of his guns, and fifty English, to aid the\nhard-pressed Mahrattas in the grove; and fifty others to the village,\nwith orders to join the Sepoys there, to dash forward on to the\ncauseway, and charge the enemy's guns.\n\nAs the column issued from the village along the causeway, at a rapid\npace, the French limbered up their guns and retired at a gallop. The\ninfantry, dispirited at their disappearance, fell back across the rice\nfields; an example which their horsemen on their right, already\ndispirited by the loss which they were suffering, from the\nnewly-arrived English musketry and the discharges of the field pieces,\nfollowed without delay.\n\nClive at once ordered a pursuit. The Mahrattas were despatched after\nthe enemy's cavalry, while he himself, with his infantry, advanced\nacross the causeway and pressed upon the main body. Three times the\nenemy made a stand, but each time failed to resist the impetuosity of\nthe pursuers, and the night alone put a stop to the pursuit, by which\ntime the enemy were completely routed.\n\nThe material loss had not been heavy, for but fifty French and a\nhundred and fifty natives were killed or wounded; but the army was\nbroken up, the morale of the enemy completely destroyed; and it was\nproved to all Southern India, which was anxiously watching the\nstruggle, that the English were, in the field of battle, superior to\ntheir European rivals. This assurance alone had an immense effect. It\nconfirmed, in their alliance with the English, many of the chiefs\nwhose friendship had hitherto been lukewarm; and brought over many\nwaverers to our side.\n\nIn the fight, eight Sepoys and fifty of the Mahratta cavalry were\nkilled or disabled. The English did not lose a single man. Many of\nRiza Sahib's soldiers came in, during the next few days, and enlisted\nin the British force. The Mahrattas captured the treasure, the\nprospect of which had induced them to join in the fight, and the\ngovernor of Arni agreed to hold the town for Muhammud Ali.\n\nClive moved on at once to Conjeveram, where thirty French troops and\nthree hundred Sepoys occupied the temple, a very strong building.\nClive brought up two eighteen-pounders from Madras, and pounded the\nwalls; and the enemy, seeing that the place must fall, evacuated it in\nthe night, and retired to Pondicherry. North Arcot being now\ncompletely in the power of the English, Clive returned to Madras; and\nthen sailed to Fort Saint David, to concert measures with Mr. Saunders\nfor the relief of Trichinopoli. This place still held out, thanks\nrather to the feebleness and indecision of Colonel Law, who commanded\nthe besiegers, than to any effort on the part of the defenders.\n\nGovernor Dupleix, at Pondicherry, had seen with surprise the result of\nClive's dash upon Arcot. He had, however, perceived that the\noperations there were wholly secondary, and that Trichinopoli was\nstill the all-important point. The fall of that place would more than\nneutralize Clive's successes at Arcot; and he, therefore, did not\nsuffer Clive's operations to distract his attention here. Strong\nreinforcements and a battering train were sent forward to the\nbesiegers; and, by repeated messages, he endeavoured to impress upon\nLaw and Chunda Sahib the necessity of pressing forward the capture of\nTrichinopoli.\n\nBut Dupleix was unfortunate in his instruments. Law was always\nhesitating and doubting. Chunda Sahib, although clever to plan, was\nweak in action; indecisive, at moments when it was most necessary that\nhe should be firm. So then, in spite of the entreaties of Dupleix, he\nhad detached a considerable force to besiege Clive. Dupleix, seeing\nthis, and hoping that Clive might be detained at Arcot long enough to\nallow of the siege of Trichinopoli being brought to a conclusion, had\nsent the three hundred French soldiers to strengthen the force of Riza\nSahib.\n\nHe had still an overpowering force at Trichinopoli, Law having nine\nhundred trained French soldiers, a park of fifty guns, two thousand\nSepoys, and the army of Chunda Sahib, twenty thousand strong. Inside\nTrichinopoli were a few English soldiers under Captain Cope, and a\nsmall body of troops of Muhammud Ali; while outside the walls, between\nthem and the besiegers, was the English force under Gingen, the men\nutterly dispirited, the officer without talent, resolution, or\nconfidence.\n\nBefore leaving the troops with which he had won the battle of Arni,\nClive had expressed, to the two young writers, his high appreciation\nof their conduct during the siege of Arcot; and promised them that he\nwould make it a personal request, to the authorities at Fort Saint\nDavid, that they might be permanently transferred from the civil to\nthe military branch of the service; and such a request, made by him,\nwas certain to be complied with. He strongly advised them to spend\nevery available moment of their time in the study of the native\nlanguage; as, without that, they would be useless if appointed to\ncommand a body of Sepoys.\n\nDelighted at the prospect, now open to them, of a permanent relief\nfrom the drudgery of a clerk's life in Madras, the young fellows were\nin the highest spirits; and Tim Kelly was scarcely less pleased, when\nhe heard that Charlie was now likely to be always employed with him.\nThe boys lost not a moment in sending down to Madras, to engage the\nservices of a native \"moonshee\" or teacher. They wrote to their friend\nJohnson, asking him to arrange terms with the man who understood most\nEnglish, and to engage him to remain with them some time.\n\nA few days later, Tim Kelly came in.\n\n\"Plase, yer honors, there's a little shrivelled atomy of a man\noutside, as wants to spake wid ye. He looks for all the world like a\nmonkey, wrapped up in white clothes, but he spakes English after a\nfashion, and has brought this letter for you. The cratur scarce looks\nlike a human being, and I misdoubt me whether you had better let him\nin.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Tim,\" Charlie said, opening the letter; \"it's the moonshee\nwe are expecting, from Madras. He has come to teach us the native\nlanguage.\"\n\n\"Moonshine, is it! By jabers, and it's a mighty poor compliment to the\nmoon to call him so. And is it the language you're going to larn now?\nShure, Mr. Charles, I wouldn't demane myself by larning the lingo of\nthese black hathens. Isn't for them to larn the English, and mighty\npleased they ought to be, to get themselves to spake like Christians.\"\n\n\"But who's going to teach them, Tim?\"\n\n\"Oh, they larn fast enough,\" said Tim. \"You've only got to point to a\nbottle of water, or to the fire, or whatever else you want, and swear\nat them, and they understand directly. I've tried it myself, over and\nover again.\"\n\n\"There, Tim, it's no use standing talking any longer. Bring in the\nmoonshee.\"\n\nFrom that moment, the little man had his permanent post in a corner of\nthe boys' room; and, when they were not on duty, they were constantly\nengaged in studying the language, writing down the names of every\nobject they came across and getting it by heart, and learning every\nsentence, question, and answer which occurred to them as likely to be\nuseful.\n\nAs for Tim, he quite lost patience at this devotion to study on the\npart of his master; who, he declared to his comrades, went on just as\nif he intended to become a nigger and a hathen himself.\n\n\"It's just awful to hear him, Corporal M'Bean, jabbering away in that\nforeign talk, with that little black monkey moonshine. The little\ncratur a-twisting his shrivelled fingers about, that looks as if the\nbones were coming through the skin. I wonder what the good father at\nBlarney, where I come from, you know, Corporal, would say to sich\ngoings on. Faith, then, and if he were here, I'd buy a bottle of holy\nwater, and sprinkle it over the little hathen. I suspict he'd fly\nstraight up the chimney, when it touched him.\"\n\n\"My opinion of you, Tim Kelly,\" the corporal, who was a grave\nScotchman, said; \"is that you're just a fule. Your master is a brave\nyoung gentleman, and is a deal more sensible than most of them, who\nspend all their time in drinking wine and playing cards. A knowledge\nof the language is most useful. What would you do, yourself, if you\nwere to marry a native woman, and couldn't speak to her afterwards.\"\n\n\"The saints defind us!\" Tim exclaimed; \"and what put such an idea in\nyer head, Corporal? It's nayther more nor less than an insult to\nsuppose that I, a dacent boy, and brought up under the teaching of\nFather O'Shea, should marry a hathen black woman; and if you weren't\nmy suparior officer, corporal, I'd tach ye better manners.\"\n\nFortunately, at this moment Charlie's voice was heard, shouting for\nhis servant; and Tim was therefore saved from the breach of the peace,\nwhich his indignation showed that he meditated.\n\nDecember passed quietly; and then, in January, 1752, an insurrection\nplanned by Dupleix broke out. The governor of Pondicherry had been\nsuffering keenly from disappointments; which, as time went on, and his\nentreaties and commands to Law to attack Trichinopoli were answered\nonly by excuses and reasons for delay, grew to despair; and he\nresolved upon making another effort to occupy the attention of the man\nin whom he already recognized a great rival, and to prevent his taking\nsteps for the relief of Trichinopoli. Law had over and over again\nassured him that, in the course of a very few weeks, that place would\nbe driven by famine to surrender; and, as soon as Clive arrived at\nFort Saint David, Dupleix set about taking steps which would again\nnecessitate his return to the north, and so give to Law the time which\nhe asked for.\n\nSupplies of money were sent to Riza Sahib, together with four hundred\nFrench soldiers. These marched suddenly upon Punemalli and captured\nit, seized again the fortified temple of Conjeveram, and from this\npoint threatened both Madras and Arcot.\n\nHad this force possessed an active and determined commander, it could\nundoubtedly have carried out Dupleix's instructions, captured Madras,\nand inflicted a terrible blow upon the English. Fortunately, it had no\nsuch head. It marched indeed against Madras, plundered and burnt the\nfactories, levied contributions, and obtained possession of everything\nbut the fort; where the civilians, and the few men who constituted the\ngarrison, daily expected to be attacked, in which case the place must\nhave fallen. This, however, the enemy never even attempted, contenting\nthemselves with ravaging the place outside the walls of the fort.\n\nThe little garrison of Arcot, two hundred men in all, were astonished\nat the news; that the province, which they had thought completely\nconquered, was again in flames; that the road to Madras was cut, by\nthe occupation of Conjeveram by the French; and that Madras itself\nwas, save the fort, in the hands of the enemy. The fort itself, they\nknew, might easily be taken, as they were aware that it was defended\nby only eighty men.\n\nThe change in the position was at once manifest, in the altered\nattitude of the fickle population. The main body of the inhabitants of\nSouthern India were Hindoos, who had for centuries been ruled by\nforeign masters. The Mohammedans from the north had been their\nconquerors, and the countless wars which had taken place, to them\nsignified merely whether one family or another were to reign over\nthem. The sole desire was for peace and protection; and they,\ntherefore, ever inclined towards the side which seemed strongest.\nTheir sympathies were no stronger with their Mohammedan rulers than\nwith the French or English, and they only hoped that whatever power\nwas strongest might conquer; and that, after the hostilities were\nover, their daily work might be conducted in peace, and their property\nand possessions be enjoyed in security. The capture and defence of\nArcot, and the battle of Arni, had brought them to regard the English\nas their final victors; and the signs of deep and even servile\nrespect, which greeted the conquerors wherever they went, and which\nabsolutely disgusted Charlie Marryat and his friend, were really\nsincere marks of the welcome to masters who seemed able and willing to\nmaintain their rule over them.\n\nWith the news of the successes of Riza Sahib, all this changed. The\nnatives no longer bent to the ground, as the English passed them in\nthe streets. The country people, who had flocked in with their\nproducts to the markets, absented themselves altogether, and the whole\npopulation prepared to welcome the French as their new masters.\n\nIn the fort, the utmost vigilance was observed. The garrison laboured\nto mend the breaches, and complete the preparations for defence.\nProvisions were again stored up, and they awaited anxiously news from\nClive.\n\nThat enterprising officer was at Fort Saint David, busy in making his\npreparations for a decisive campaign against the enemy round\nTrichinopoli, when the news of the rising reached him. He was\nexpecting a considerable number of fresh troops from England, as it\nwas in January that the majority of the reinforcements despatched by\nthe Company arrived in India; and Mr. Saunders had written to\nCalcutta, begging that a hundred men might be sent thence. These were\nnow, with the eighty men at Madras, and the two hundred at Arcot, all\nthe force that could be at his disposal, for at Fort Saint David there\nwas not a single available man.\n\nWith all the efforts that Clive, aided by the authorities, could make,\nit was not until the middle of February that he had completed his\narrangements. On the 9th, the hundred men arrived from Bengal, and,\nwithout the loss of a day, Clive started from Madras to form a\njunction with the garrison from Arcot, who, leaving only a small force\nto hold the fort, had moved down to meet him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. The Battle Of Kavaripak.\n\n\nThe troops from Arcot had already moved some distance on their way to\nMadras, and Clive, therefore, with the new levies, joined them on the\nday after his leaving Madras. The French and Riza Sahib let slip the\nopportunity of attacking these bodies, before they united. They were\nwell aware of their movements, and had resolved upon tactics,\ncalculated in the first place to puzzle the English commander, to wear\nout his troops, and to enable them finally to surprise and take him\nentirely at a disadvantage.\n\nThe junction with the Arcot garrison raised the force under Clive's\norders to three hundred and eighty English, thirteen hundred Sepoys,\nand six field guns, while the enemy at Vendalur, a place twenty-five\nmiles south of Madras, where they had a fortified camp, had four\nhundred French troops, two thousand Sepoys, two thousand five hundred\ncavalry, and twelve guns.\n\nHoping to surprise them there, Clive marched all night. When the force\napproached the town they heard that the enemy had disappeared, and\nthat they had started, apparently, in several directions.\n\nThe force was halted for a few hours, and then the news was obtained\nthat the enemy had united their forces at Conjeveram, and that they\nhad marched away from that place in a westerly direction. Doubting not\nthat they were about to attack Arcot, which, weakened by the departure\nof the greater portion of its garrison, would be in no position to\ndefend itself against a sudden coup de main by a strong force, Clive\nset his troops again in motion. The French, indeed, had already bribed\nsome of the native soldiers within the fort; who were to reply to a\nsignal made without, if they were in a position to open the gates.\nHowever, by good fortune their treachery had been discovered, and when\nthe French arrived they received no reply to their signal; and as\nArcot would be sure to fall if they defeated Clive, they marched away\nwithout attacking it, to take up the position which they had agreed\nupon beforehand.\n\nIt was at nine in the evening that Clive, at Vendalur, obtained\nintelligence that the enemy had assembled at Conjeveram. The troops\nhad already marched twenty-five miles, but they had had a rest of five\nhours, and Clive started with them at once, and reached Conjeveram,\ntwenty miles distant, at four in the morning. Finding that the enemy\nhad again disappeared, he ordered the troops to halt for a few hours.\nThey had already marched forty-five miles in twenty-four hours, a\ngreat feat when it is remembered that only the Arcot garrison were in\nany way accustomed to fatigue, the others being newly raised levies.\nThe greater portion of the Sepoys had been enlisted within the\nfortnight preceding.\n\n\"I don't know, Mr. Marryat, whether the French call this fighting. I\ncall it playing hide and seek,\" Tim Kelly said. \"Shure we've bin\nmarching, with only a halt of two or three hours, since yisterday\nmorning; and my poor feet are that sore that I daren't take my boots\noff me, for I'm shure I'd never git 'em on agin. If the French want to\nfight us, why don't they do it square and honest, not be racing and\nchasing about like a lot of wild sheep.\"\n\n\"Have you seen the moonshee, Tim? He is with the baggage.\"\n\n\"Shure and I saw him,\" Tim said. \"The cart come in just now, and there\nwas he, perched up on the top of it like a dried monkey. You don't\nwant him tonight, shure, yer honor.\"\n\n\"Oh no, I don't want him, Tim. You'd better go now, and get to sleep\nat once, if you can. We may be off again, at any minute.\"\n\nArcot is twenty-seven miles from Conjeveram. Clive felt certain that\nthe enemy had gone on to that place; but, anxious as he was for its\nsafety, it was absolutely necessary that the troops should have a rest\nbefore starting on such a march. They were, therefore, allowed to rest\nuntil twelve o'clock; when, refreshed by their eight hours' halt and\nbreakfast, they started upon their long march towards Arcot, making\nsure that they should not find the enemy until they reached that\nplace.\n\nHad Clive possessed a body of cavalry, however small, he would have\nbeen able to scour the country, and to make himself acquainted with\nthe real position of the French. Cavalry are to a general what eyes\nare to a man, and without these he is liable to tumble into a pitfall.\nSuch was the case on the present occasion. Having no doubt that the\nenemy were engaged in attacking Arcot, the troops were plodding along\ncarelessly and in loose order; when, to their astonishment, after a\nsixteen-mile march, as they approached the town of Kavaripak just as\nthe sun was setting, a fire of artillery opened upon them from a grove\nupon the right of the road, but two hundred and fifty yards distant.\nNothing is more confusing than a surprise of this kind, especially to\nyoung troops, and when no enemy is thought to be near.\n\nThe French general's plans had been well laid. He had reached\nKavaripak that morning, and allowed his troops to rest all day, and he\nexpected to obtain an easy victory over the tired men who would,\nunsuspicious of danger, be pressing on to the relief of Arcot. So far\nhis calculations had been correct, and the English marched\nunsuspiciously into the trap laid for them.\n\nThe twelve French guns were placed in a grove, round whose sides,\nfacing the point from which Clive was approaching, ran a deep ditch\nwith a high bank forming a regular battery. A body of French infantry\nwere placed in support of the guns, with some Sepoys in reserve behind\nthe grove. Parallel with the road on the left ran a deep watercourse,\nnow empty, and in this the rest of the infantry were stationed, at a\npoint near the town of Kavaripak, and about a quarter of a mile\nfurther back than the grove. On either side of this watercourse the\nenemy had placed his powerful cavalry force.\n\nFor a moment, when the guns opened, there was confusion and panic\namong the British troops. Clive, however, ever cool and confident in\ndanger, and well seconded by his officers, rallied them at once. The\nposition was one of extreme danger. It was possible, indeed, to\nretreat, but in the face of an enemy superior in infantry and guns,\nand possessing so powerful a body of cavalry, the operation would have\nbeen a very dangerous one. Even if accomplished, it would entail an\nimmense loss of morale and prestige to his troops. Hitherto, under his\nleading, they had been always successful; and a belief in his own\nsuperiority adds immensely to the fighting power of a soldier. Even\nshould the remnant of the force fight its way back to Madras, the\ncampaign would have been a lost one, and all hope of saving\nTrichinopoli would have been at an end.\n\n\"Steady, lads, steady,\" he shouted. \"Form up quietly and steadily. We\nhave beaten the enemy before, you know, and we will do so again.\"\n\nWhile the troops, in spite of the artillery fire, fell into line,\nClive rapidly surveyed the ground. He saw the enemy's infantry\nadvancing up the watercourse, and so sheltered by it as to be out of\nthe fire of his troops. He saw their cavalry sweeping down on the\nother side of the watercourse, menacing his left and threatening his\nbaggage. The guns were at once brought up from the rear, but before\nthese arrived the men were falling fast.\n\nThree of the guns he placed to answer the French battery, two of them\nhe hurried to his left, with a small body of English and two hundred\nSepoys, to check the advance of the enemy's cavalry. The main body of\nhis infantry he ordered into the watercourse, which afforded them a\nshelter from the enemy's artillery. The baggage carts and baggage he\nsent half a mile to the rear, under the protection of forty Sepoys and\na gun.\n\nWhile this was being done the enemy's fire was continuing, but his\ninfantry advanced but slowly, and had not reached a point abreast of\nthe grove when the British force in the watercourse met them. It would\nnot seem to be a very important matter, at what point in the\nwatercourse the infantry of the two opposing parties came into\ncollision, but matters apparently trifling in themselves often decide\nthe fate of battles; and, in fact, had the French artillery retained\ntheir fire until their infantry were abreast of the grove, the battle\nof Kavaripak would have been won by them, and the British power in\nSouthern India would have been destroyed.\n\nClive moved confidently and resolutely among his men, keeping up their\ncourage by cheerful words, and he was well seconded by his officers.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" Charlie Marryat cried to the company of which he was in\ncommand, \"stick to it. You ought to be very thankful to the French,\nfor saving you the trouble of having to march another twelve miles\nbefore giving you an opportunity of thrashing them.\"\n\nThe men laughed, and redoubled their fire on the French infantry, who\nwere facing them in the watercourse at a distance of eighty yards.\nNeither party liked to charge. The French commander knew that he had\nonly to hold his position to win the day. His guns were mowing down\nthe English artillerymen. The English party on the left of the\nwatercourse, with difficulty, held their own against the charges of\nhis horsemen, and were rapidly dwindling away under the artillery\nfire, while other bodies of his cavalry had surrounded the baggage,\nand were attacking the little force told off to guard it. He knew,\ntoo, that any attempt the English might make to attack the battery,\nwith its strong defences, must inevitably fail.\n\nThe situation was becoming desperate. It was now ten o'clock. The\nfight had gone on for four hours. No advantage had been gained, the\nmen were losing confidence, and the position grew more and more\ndesperate. Clive saw that there was but one chance of victory. The\ngrove could not be carried in the front, but it was just possible that\nit might be open in the rear.\n\nChoosing a sergeant who spoke the native language well, he bade him\nleave the party in the watercourse, and make his way round to the rear\nof the grove, and discover whether it was strongly guarded there or\nnot. In twenty minutes, the sergeant returned with the news that there\nwas no strong force there.\n\nClive at once took two hundred of his English infantry, the men who\nhad fought at Arcot, and quietly left the watercourse and made his way\nround towards the rear of the grove. Before he had gone far the main\nbody in the watercourse, surprised at the sudden withdrawal of the\ngreater portion of the English force, and missing the presence of\nClive himself, began to lose heart. They no longer replied\nenergetically to the fire of the French infantry. A movement of\nretreat began, the fire ceased, and in a minute or two they would have\nbroken in flight.\n\nAt this moment, Clive returned. As he moved forward, he had marked the\ndying away of the English fire, and guessing what had happened, had\ngiven over the command of the column to Lieutenant Keene, the senior\nofficer, and hurried back to the watercourse. He arrived there just as\nthe troops had commenced to run away.\n\nThrowing himself among them, with shouts and exhortations, he\nsucceeded in arresting their flight; and, by assurances that the\nbattle was as good as won elsewhere, and that they had only to hold\ntheir ground for a few minutes longer to ensure victory, he got them\nto advance to their former position; and to reopen fire on the French,\nwho had, fortunately, remained inactive instead of advancing and\ntaking advantage of the cessation of the English fire.\n\nIn the meantime, Lieutenant Keene led his detachment, making a long\ncircuit, to a point three hundred yards immediately behind the grove.\nHe then sent forward one of his officers, Ensign Symmonds, who spoke\nFrench perfectly, to reconnoitre the grove. Symmonds had proceeded but\na little way, when he came upon a large number of French Sepoys, who\nwere covering the rear of the grove; but who, as their services were\nnot required, were sheltering themselves there from the random bullets\nwhich were flying about. They at once challenged; but Symmonds\nanswering them in French they, being unable to see his uniform in the\ndarkness, and supposing him to be a French officer, allowed him to\nadvance.\n\nHe passed boldly forward into the grove. He proceeded nearly through\nit, until he came within sight of the guns, which were still keeping\nup their fire upon those of the English; while a hundred French\ninfantry, who were in support, were all occupied in watching what was\ngoing on in front of them. Symmonds returned to the detachment, by a\npath to the right of that by which he had entered, and passed out\nwithout seeing a soul.\n\nLieutenant Keene gave the word to advance and, following the guidance\nof Mr. Symmonds, entered the grove. He advanced, unobserved, until\nwithin thirty yards of the enemy. Here he halted, and poured a volley\ninto them.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous. Many of the French fell, and the rest,\nastounded at this sudden and unexpected attack, left their guns and\nfled. Sixty of them rushed for shelter into a building at the end of\nthe grove, where the English surrounded them and forced them to\nsurrender.\n\nBy this sudden stroke, the battle of Kavaripak was won. The sound of\nthe musketry fire, and the immediate cessation of that of the enemy's\nguns, told Clive that the grove was captured. A few minutes later\nfugitives, arriving from the grove, informed the commander of the\nenemy's main body of infantry of the misfortune which had befallen\nthem. The French fire at once ceased, and the troops withdrew.\n\nIn the darkness, it was impossible for Clive to attempt a pursuit. He\nwas in ignorance of the direction the enemy had taken; his troops had\nalready marched sixty miles in two days; and he would, moreover, have\nbeen exposed to sudden dashes of the enemy's cavalry. Clive,\ntherefore, united his troops, joined his baggage, which the little\nguard had gallantly defended against the attacks of the enemy's\ncavalry, and waited for morning.\n\nAt daybreak, not an enemy was to be seen. Fifty Frenchmen lay dead on\nthe field, and sixty were captives. Three hundred French Sepoys had\nfallen. There were, besides, many wounded. The enemy's artillery had\nbeen all captured. The British loss was forty English and thirty\nSepoys killed, and a great number of both wounded.\n\nThe moral effect of the victory was immense. It was the first time\nthat French and English soldiers had fought in the field against each\nother, in India. The French had proved to the natives that they were\nenormously their superiors in fighting power. Hitherto the English had\nnot done so. The defence of Arcot had proved that they could fight\nbehind walls; but the natives had, themselves, many examples of\ngallant defences of this kind. The English troops, under Gingen and\nCope, had suffered themselves to be cooped up in Trichinopoli, and had\nnot struck a blow in its defence.\n\nAt Kavaripak, the natives discovered that the English could fight as\nwell, or better than the French. The latter were somewhat stronger,\nnumerically, than their rivals. They had double the force of\nartillery, were half as strong again in Sepoys, and had two thousand\nfive hundred cavalry, while the English had not a single horseman.\nThey had all the advantages of surprise and position; and yet, they\nhad been entirely defeated.\n\nThenceforth the natives of India regarded the English as a people to\nbe feared and respected; and, for the first time, considered their\nultimate triumph over the French to be a possibility. As the policy of\nthe native princes had ever been to side with the strongest, the\nadvantage thus gained to the English cause, by the victory of\nKavaripak, was enormous.\n\nOn the following day, the English took possession of the fort of\nKavaripak, and marched to Arcot. Scarcely had they arrived there when\nClive received a despatch from Fort Saint David; ordering him to\nreturn there at once, with all his troops; to march to the relief of\nTrichinopoli, where the garrison was reported to be in the sorest\nstraits, from want of provisions.\n\nThe force reached Fort Saint David on the 11th of March. Here\npreparations were hurried forward for the advance to Trichinopoli;\nand, in three days, Clive was ready to start. Just as he was about to\nset out, a ship arrived from England, having on board some more\ntroops, together with Major Lawrence and several officers, some of\nwhom were captains senior to Clive.\n\nMajor Lawrence, who had already proved his capacity and energy, of\ncourse took command of the expedition; and treated Clive, who had\nserved under him at the siege of Pondicherry, and whose successes in\nthe field had attracted his high admiration, as second in command,\nsomewhat to the discontent of the officers senior to him in rank.\n\nThe force consisted of four hundred Europeans, eleven hundred Sepoys,\nand eight guns, and escorted a large train of provisions and stores.\nDuring these months which the diversion, caused by the attack of Riza\nSahib and the French upon Madras, had given to the besiegers of\nTrichinopoli, they should have long since captured the town. In spite\nof all the orders of Dupleix, Law could not bring himself to attack\nthe town; and the French governor of Pondicherry saw, with dismay,\nthat the two months and a half, which his efforts and energy had\ngained for the besiegers, had been entirely wasted; and that it was\nprobable the whole fruits of his labours would be thrown away.\n\nHe now directed Law to leave only a small force in front of\nTrichinopoli, and to march with the whole of his army, and that of\nChunda Sahib, and crush the force advancing under Lawrence to the\nrelief of Trichinopoli. Law, however, disobeyed orders; and, indeed,\nacted in direct contradiction to them. He maintained six hundred\nFrench troops and many thousands of native before Trichinopoli, and\nsent but two hundred and fifty French, and about three hundred and\nfifty natives--a force altogether inferior in numbers to that which it\nwas sent to oppose--to arrest the progress of Lawrence's advancing\ncolumn.\n\nThe position which this French force was directed to occupy was the\nfort of Koiladi, an admirable position. As the two branches of the\nKavari were, here, but half a mile apart, had Law concentrated all his\nforce here he could, no doubt, have successfully opposed the English.\n\nLawrence, however, when the guns of the fort opened upon him, replied\nto them by the fire of his artillery; and, as the French force was\ninsufficient to enable its commander to fight him in the open, he was\nenabled to take his troops and convoy in safety past the fort. When\nLaw heard this, he marched out and took his position round a lofty,\nand almost, inaccessible rock called Elmiseram, and prepared to give\nbattle.\n\nLawrence, however, after passing Koiladi, had been joined by a hundred\nEnglish and fifty dragoons, from Trichinopoli. These acted as guides,\nand led him by a route by which he avoided the French position; and\neffected a junction with two hundred Europeans, and four hundred\nSepoys from Trichinopoli; and with a body of Mahratta cavalry, under\nMurari Reo.\n\nLaw, having failed to attack the English force upon its march, now,\nwhen its strength was nearly doubled, suddenly decided to give battle,\nand advanced against the force which, wearied with its long march, had\njust begun to prepare their breakfast. The French artillery at once\nput the Mahratta cavalry to flight.\n\nLawrence called the men again under arms, and sent Clive forward to\nreconnoitre. He found the French infantry drawn up, with twenty-two\nguns, with large bodies of cavalry on either flank. Opposite to the\ncentre of their position was a large caravansary, or native inn, with\nstone buildings attached. It was nearer to their position than to that\noccupied by the English, and Clive saw at once that, if seized and\nheld by the enemy's artillery, it would sweep the whole ground over\nwhich the English would have to advance.\n\nHe galloped back at full speed to Major Lawrence, and asked leave at\nonce to occupy the building. Obtaining permission, he advanced with\nall speed to the caravansary, with some guns and infantry.\n\nThe negligence of the French, in allowing this movement to be carried\nout, was fatal to them. The English artillery opened upon them from\nthe cover of the inn and buildings, and to this fire the French in the\nopen could reply only at a great disadvantage. After a cannonade\nlasting half an hour, the French, having lost forty European and three\nhundred native soldiers, fell back; the English having lost only\ntwenty-one.\n\nDisheartened at this result, utterly disappointed at the failure which\nhad attended his long operations against Trichinopoli, without energy\nor decision, Law at once raised the siege of the town, abandoning a\ngreat portion of his baggage; and, destroying great stores of\nammunition and supplies, crossed an arm of the Kavari and took post in\nthe great fortified temple of Seringam.\n\nThe delight of the troops; so long besieged in Trichinopoli; inactive,\ndispirited, and hopeless, was extreme; and the exultation of Muhammud\nAli and his native allies was no less.\n\nCaptain Cope, towards the end of the siege, had been killed, in one of\nthe little skirmishes which occasionally took place with the French.\n\nCharlie Marryat and Peters had, owing to some of the officers senior\nto them being killed or invalided, and to large numbers of fresh\nrecruits being raised, received a step in rank. They were now\nlieutenants, and each commanded a body of Sepoys, two hundred strong.\nAt Charlie's request, Tim Kelly was detached from his company, and\nallowed to remain with him as soldier servant. After the retreat of\nthe French, and the settling down of the English force in the lines\nthey had occupied, Charlie and his friend entered Trichinopoli, and\nwere surprised at the temples and palaces there. Although very\ninferior to Tanjore, and in no way even comparable to the cities of\nthe northwest of India, Trichinopoli was a far more important city\nthan any they had hitherto seen. They ascended the lofty rock, and\nvisited the fort on its summit, which looked as if, in the hands of a\nresolute garrison, it should be impregnable to attack.\n\nThe manner in which this rock, as well as that of Elmiseram and others\nlying in sight, rose sheer up from the plain, filled them with\nsurprise; for, although these natural rock fortresses are common\nenough in India, they are almost without an example in Europe. After\nvisiting the fort they rambled through the town, and were amused at\nthe scene of bustle in its streets; and at the gay shops, full of\narticles new and curious to them, in the bazaars.\n\n\"They are wonderfully clever and ingenious,\" Charlie said. \"Look what\nrough tools that man is working with, and what delicate and intricate\nwork he is turning out. If these fellows could but fight as well as\nthey work, and were but united among themselves, not only should we be\nunable to set a foot in India, but the emperor, with the enormous\narmies which he would be able to raise, would be able to threaten\nEurope. I suppose they never have been really good fighting men.\nAlexander, a couple of thousand years ago, defeated them; and since\nthen the Afghans, and other northern peoples, have been always\noverrunning and conquering them.\n\n\"I can't make it out. These Sepoys, after only a few weeks' training,\nfight almost as well as our own men. I wonder how it is that, when\ncommanded by their own countrymen, they are able to make so poor a\nfight of it.\n\n\"We had better be going back to camp again, Peters. At any moment,\nthere may be orders for us to do something. With Major Lawrence and\nClive together, we are not likely to stop here long, inactive.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. The Fall Of Seringam.\n\n\nAlthough called an island, Seringam is in fact a long narrow tongue of\nland, running between the two branches of the river Kavari. In some\nplaces these arms are but a few hundred yards apart, and the island\ncan therefore be defended against an attack along the land. But the\nretreat of the French by this line was equally difficult, as we held\nthe narrowest part of the neck, two miles from Koiladi.\n\nUpon the south, our forces at Trichinopoli faced the French across the\nriver. Upon the other side of the Kolrun, as the northern arm of the\nKavari is called, the French could cross the river and make their\nretreat, if necessary, in any direction. The two principal roads,\nhowever, led from Paichandah, a strong fortified position on the bank\nof the river, facing the temple of Seringam.\n\nClive saw that a force crossing the river, and taking up its position\non the north, would entirely cut off Law's army in the island; would\nintercept any reinforcements sent by Dupleix to its rescue; and might\ncompel the surrender of the whole French army. The attempt would, of\ncourse, be a dangerous one. The French force was considerably stronger\nthan the English, and were the latter divided into two portions,\nentirely cut off from each other, the central point between them being\noccupied by the French, the latter would have an opportunity of\nthrowing his whole force upon one after the other.\n\nThis danger would have been so great that, had the French been\ncommanded by an able and active officer, the attempt would never have\nbeen made. Law, however, had shown amply that he had neither energy\nnor intelligence, and Major Lawrence therefore accepted Clive's\nproposal.\n\nBut to be successful, it was necessary that both portions of the\nEnglish force should be well commanded. Major Lawrence felt confident\nin his own capacity to withstand Law upon the southern bank, and in\ncase of necessity he could fall back under the guns of Trichinopoli.\nHe felt sure that he could, with equal certainty, confide the command\nof the other party to Captain Clive. There was, however, the\ndifficulty that he was the junior captain present; and that already\ngreat jealousy had been excited, among his seniors, by the rank which\nhe occupied in the councils of Lawrence.\n\nFortunately, the difficulty was settled by the native allies. Major\nLawrence laid his plans before Muhammud Ali and his allies, whose\ncooperation and assistance were absolutely necessary. These, after\nhearing the proposal, agreed to give their assistance, but only upon\nthe condition that Clive should be placed in command of the\nexpeditionary party. They had already seen the paralysing effects of\nthe incapacity of some English officers. Clive's defence of Arcot, and\nthe victories of Arni and Kavaripak, had excited their intense\nadmiration, and caused them to place unbounded confidence in him.\nTherefore they said:\n\n\"If Captain Clive commands, we will go--unless he commands, we do\nnot.\"\n\nMajor Lawrence was glad that the pressure thus placed upon him enabled\nhim, without incurring a charge of favouritism, to place the command\nin the hands of the officer upon whom he most relied.\n\nOn the night of the 6th of April Clive set out; with a force composed\nof four hundred English, seven hundred Sepoys, three thousand Mahratta\ncavalry, a thousand Tanjore cavalry, six light guns and two heavy\nones. Descending the river, he crossed the island at a point three\nmiles to the east of Law's camping ground, and marched to Samieaveram,\na town nine miles north of the island, and commanding the roads from\nthe north and east.\n\nThe movement was just made in time. Dupleix, utterly disgusted with\nLaw, had resolved to displace him. D'Auteuil, the only officer he had\nof sufficient high rank to take his place, had not, when previously\nemployed, betrayed any great energy or capacity. It appeared,\nnevertheless, that he was at any rate superior to Law. On the 10th of\nApril, therefore, he despatched D'Auteuil, with a hundred and twenty\nFrench, and five hundred Sepoys, with four guns and a large convoy, to\nSeringam, where he was to take the command. When he arrived within\nfifteen miles of Samieaveram, he learned that Clive had possession of\nthat village, and he determined upon a circuitous route, by which he\nmight avoid him. He therefore sent a messenger to Law, to acquaint him\nwith his plans, in order that he might aid him by making a diversion.\n\nClive, in the meantime, had been at work. On the day after his arrival\nat Samieaveram, he attacked and captured the temple of Mansurpet,\nhalfway between the village and the island. The temple was lofty, and\nstood on rising ground, and commanded a range of the country for many\nmiles round.\n\nOn its top, Clive established a signal station. Upon the following day\nhe carried the mud fort of Lalgudi, which was situated on the north\nbank of the river, two miles to the east of Paichandah, which now\nremained Law's only place of exit from the island.\n\nD'Auteuil, after sending word to Law of his intentions, marched from\nUtatua, where he was lying, by a road to the west which would enable\nhim to move round Samieaveram to Paichandah. Clive captured one of the\nmessengers, and set off with his force to intercept him. D'Auteuil,\nhowever, received information by his spies of Clive's movement, and\nnot wishing to fight a battle in the open, with a superior force, fell\nback to Utatua, while Clive returned to Samieaveram.\n\nLaw, too, had received news of Clive's movement. Here was a chance of\nretrieving the misfortunes of the campaign. Paichandah being still in\nhis hands, he could sally out with his whole force and that of Chunda\nSahib, seize Samieaveram in Clive's absence, and extend his hand to\nD'Auteuil, or fall upon Clive's rear. Instead of this, he repeated the\nmistake he had made before Trichinopoli; and, instead of marching out\nwith his whole force, he sent only eighty Europeans, of whom forty\nwere deserters from the English army, and seven hundred Sepoys.\n\nThe English returned from their march against D'Auteuil. The greater\nportion of the troops were housed in two temples, a quarter of a mile\napart, known as the Large and Small Pagoda. Clive, with several of his\nofficers, was in a caravansary close to the Small Pagoda.\n\nCharlie's company were on guard, and after paying a visit to the\nsentries, and seeing that all were on the alert, he returned to the\ncaravansary. The day had been a long one, and the march under the heat\nof the sun very fatiguing. There was therefore but little\nconversation, and Charlie, finding, on his return from visiting the\nsentries, that his leader and the other officers had already wrapped\nthemselves in their cloaks and lain down to rest, imitated their\nexample.\n\nHalf an hour later, the French column arrived at Samieaveram. The\nofficer in command was a daring and determined man. Before reaching\nthe place, he had heard that the English had returned; and, finding\nthat he had been forestalled, he might well have returned to Law. He\ndetermined, however, to attempt to surprise the camp. He placed his\ndeserters in front, and when the column, arriving near the Sepoy\nsentinel, was challenged, the officer in command of the deserters, an\nIrishman, stepped forward, and said that he had been sent by Major\nLawrence to the support of Captain Clive. As the other English-speaking\nsoldiers now came up, the sentry and native officer with him were\ncompletely deceived, and the latter sent a soldier to guide the column\nto the English quarter of the camp.\n\nWithout interruption, the column marched on through lines of sleeping\nSepoys and Mahrattas until they reached the heart of the village. Here\nthey were again challenged. They replied with a volley of musketry\ninto the caravansary, and another into the pagoda. Then they rushed\ninto the pagoda, bayoneting all they found there.\n\nCharlie, who had just dropped off to sleep, sprang to his feet, as did\nthe other officers. While, confused by the noise and suddenness of the\nattack, others scarcely understood what was happening, Clive's clear\nhead and ready judgment grasped the situation at once.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said calmly, \"there is no firing going on in the\ndirection of the Great Pagoda. Follow me there at once.\"\n\nSnatching up their arms, the officers followed him at a run. The whole\nvillage was a scene of wild confusion. The firing round the pagoda and\ncaravansary were continuous. The Mahratta horsemen were climbing into\ntheir saddles, and riding away out into the plain; the Sepoys were\nrunning hither and thither.\n\nAt the pagoda he found the soldiers turning out under arms, and Clive,\nordering his officers to do their best to rally the native troops in\ngood order against the enemy, at once moved forward towards the\ncaravansary, with two hundred English troops. On arriving there, he\nfound a large body of Sepoys firing away at random. Believing them to\nbe his own men, for the French and English Sepoys were alike dressed\nin white, he halted the English a few yards from them, and rushed\namong them, upbraiding them for their panic, striking them, and\nordering them instantly to cease firing, and to form in order.\n\nOne of the Sepoy officers recognized Clive to be an Englishman, struck\nat him, and wounded him with his sword. Clive, still believing him to\nbe one of his own men, was furious at what he considered an act of\ninsolent insubordination; and, seizing him, dragged him across to the\nSmall Pagoda to hand him over, as he supposed, to the guard there. To\nhis astonishment he found six Frenchmen at the gate, and these at once\nsummoned him to surrender.\n\nGreat as was his surprise, he did not for a moment lose coolness, and\nat once told them that he had come to beg them to lay down their arms,\nthat they were surrounded by his whole army, and that, unless they\nsurrendered, his troops would give no quarter. So impressed were the\nFrenchmen with the firmness of the speaker that three of them at once\nsurrendered, while the other three ran into the temple to inform their\ncommander.\n\nClive took the three men who had surrendered, and returned to the\nEnglish troops he had left near the caravansary. The French Sepoys had\ndiscovered that the English were enemies, and had moved quietly off.\n\nConfusion still reigned. Clive did not imagine, for a moment, that so\ndaring an assault could have been made on his camp by a small body of\nenemies, and expected every moment an attack by Law's whole force. The\ncommander of the French, in the pagoda, was disturbed by the news\nbrought in by the three men from the gate, and despatched eight of his\nmost intelligent men to ascertain exactly what was going on.\n\nThese, however, fell into the hands of the English; and the officer of\nthe party, not knowing that the Small Pagoda was in the hands of the\nFrench, handed them over to a sergeant, and told him to take a party\nand escort his eight prisoners, and the three Captain Clive had\ncaptured, to that pagoda for confinement there.\n\nUpon arrival at the gate the Frenchmen at once joined their comrades,\nand these latter were also so bewildered at the affair, that they\nallowed the English sergeant and his guard to march off again,\nunmolested.\n\nBy this time, owing to the absence of all resistance elsewhere, Clive\nhad learnt that the whole of the party who had entered the camp were\nin the Lesser Pagoda; and, as he was still expecting, momentarily, to\nbe attacked by Law's main army, he determined to rid himself of this\nenemy in his midst. The pagoda was very strong, and only two men could\nenter abreast. Clive led his men to the attack, but so well did the\nFrench defend themselves that, after losing an officer and fifteen\nmen, Clive determined to wait till morning.\n\nThe French officer, knowing that he was surrounded, and beyond the\nreach of all assistance, resolved upon cutting a way through, and at\ndaylight his men sallied out from the temple. So fierce, however, was\nthe fire with which the English received him, that twelve of his men\nwere instantly killed, and the rest ran back into the temple.\n\nClive, hoping that their commander would now surrender without further\neffusion of blood, advanced to the gateway and entered the porch to\noffer terms. He was himself so faint, from the loss of blood from his\nwounds, that he could not stand alone, but leaned against a wall,\nsupported by two sergeants. The officer commanding the deserters came\nout to parley, but, after heaping abuse upon Clive, levelled his\nmusket and discharged it at him. He missed Clive, but killed the two\nsergeants who were supporting him.\n\nThe French officer in command, indignant at this conduct, rushed\nforward at once to disavow it; and stated that he had determined to\ndefend the post to the last, solely for the sake of the deserters, but\nthat the conduct of their officer had released him from that\nobligation, and he now therefore surrendered at once.\n\nThe instant day broke, and Clive saw that Law was not, as he expected,\nat hand, he despatched the Mahratta horse in pursuit of the French\nSepoys. These were overtaken and cut to pieces, and not one man, of\nthe force which Law had despatched against Clive returned to the\nisland.\n\nThe English loss was heavy. The greater portion of the occupants of\nthe Small Pagoda were bayoneted by the French, when they entered; and,\nas fifteen others were killed in the attack, it is probable that at\nleast one-fourth of the English force under Clive were killed.\n\nClive's own escapes were extraordinary. In addition to those of being\nkilled by the French Sepoys, among whom he ran by mistake, and of\ndeath at the hands of the treacherous deserter, he had one almost as\nclose, when the French fired their volley into the caravansary. A box\nat his feet was shattered, and a servant who slept close to him was\nkilled.\n\nSome days passed, after this attack, without any fresh movement on\neither side. Major Lawrence then determined to drive back D'Auteuil.\nHe did not despatch Clive against him, as this would involve the risk\nthat Law might again march out to surprise Samieaveram. He therefore\ndirected Clive to remain at that place and watch the island, while he\nsent a force of a hundred and fifty English, four hundred Sepoys, five\nhundred Mahrattas, with four guns, to attack D'Auteuil; from his own\nforce, under Captain Dalton. This officer, in the advance, marched his\ntroops near Samieaveram; and, making as much show with them as he\ncould, impressed D'Auteuil with the idea that the force was that of\nClive.\n\nAccordingly, he broke up his camp at Utatua in the night, abandoned\nhis stores, and retreated hastily upon Valconda. Dalton then marched\nto Samieaveram, and placed his force at Clive's disposal; and, to\nprevent any disputes arising as to precedence and rank, offered\nhimself to serve under him as a volunteer.\n\nNot only D'Auteuil, but Law, was deceived by Dalton's march. From the\nlofty towers of Seringam he saw the force marching towards Utatua,\nbelieved that Clive with his whole force had left Samieaveram, and did\nnow what he should have before done--crossed the river with all his\ntroops.\n\nClive's lookout on the temple of Mansurpet perceived what was going\non, and signalled the news to Clive, who at once set out with his\nwhole force; and, before Law was prepared to issue out from\nPaichandah, Clive was within a mile of that place. Law might still\nhave fought with a fair chance of success, as he was far stronger than\nhis enemy, but he was again the victim of indecision and want of\nenergy, and, covered by Paichandah, he fell back across the river\nagain.\n\nOn the 15th of May Clive captured Paichandah, and then determined to\ngive a final blow to D'Auteuil's force; which had, he learned, again\nset out to endeavour to relieve Law. He marched to Utatua to intercept\nhim.\n\nD'Auteuil, hearing of his coming, instantly fell back again to\nValconda. The native chief of this town, however, seeing that the\naffairs of the French were desperate; and willing, like all his\ncountrymen, to make his peace with the strongest, had already accepted\nbribes from the English; and upon D'Auteuil's return, closed the gates\nand refused to admit him. Clive soon arrived, and D'Auteuil, caught\nbetween two fires, surrendered with his whole force.\n\nHad Law been a man of energy, he had yet a chance of escape. He had\nstill seven or eight hundred French troops with him, two thousand\nSepoys, and four thousand of Chunda Sahib's troops. He might, then,\nhave easily crossed the Kavari at night and fallen upon Lawrence,\nwhose force there now was greatly inferior to his own. Chunda Sahib,\nin vain, begged him to do so. His hesitation continued until, three\ndays after the surrender of D'Auteuil, a battering train reached\nLawrence; whereupon Law at once surrendered, his chief stipulation\nbeing that the life of Chunda Sahib should be spared.\n\nThis promise was not kept. The unfortunate prince had preferred to\nsurrender to the Rajah of Tanjore, who had several times intrigued\nsecretly with him, rather than to Muhammud Ali or the English, whom he\nregarded as his implacable enemies. Had he placed himself in our\nhands, his life would have been safe. He was murdered, by the\ntreacherous rajah, within twenty-four hours of his surrender.\n\nWith the fall of Seringam terminated the contest for the supremacy of\nthe Carnatic, between the English and French, fighting respectively on\nbehalf of their puppets, Muhammud Ali and Chunda Sahib. This stage of\nthe struggle was not a final one; but both by its circumstances, and\nby the prestige which we acquired in the eyes of the natives, it gave\nus a moral ascendency which, even when our fortunes were afterwards at\ntheir worst, was never lost again.\n\nMuhammud Ali had, himself, gained but little in the struggle. He was,\nindeed, nominally ruler of the Carnatic, but he had to rely for his\nposition solely on the support of the English bayonets. Indeed, the\npromises, of which he had been obliged to be lavish to his native\nallies, to keep them faithful to his cause, when that cause seemed all\nbut lost, now came upon him to trouble him; and so precarious was his\nposition, that he was obliged to ask the English to leave two hundred\nEnglish troops, and fifteen hundred of their Sepoys, to protect the\nplace against Murari Reo, and the Rajahs of Mysore and Tanjore.\n\nThe fatigues of the expedition had been great and, when the force\nreached the seacoast, Major Lawrence was forced to retire to Fort\nSaint David to recover his health; while Clive, whose health had now\ngreatly broken down, betook himself to Madras; which had, when the\ndanger of invasion by the French was at an end, become the\nheadquarters of the government of the presidency.\n\nThere were, however, two French strongholds dangerously near to\nMadras, Covelong and Chengalpatt. Two hundred recruits had just\narrived from England, and five hundred natives had been enlisted as\nSepoys. Mr. Saunders begged Clive to take the command of these, and\nreduce the two fortresses. He took with him two twenty-four pounders,\nand four officers, of whom two were Charlie Marryat and Peters; to\nboth of whom Clive was much attached, owing to their courage,\nreadiness, and good humour.\n\nCovelong was first attacked. It mounted thirty guns, and was\ngarrisoned by fifty French, and three hundred Sepoys.\n\n\"I don't like the look o' things, Mr. Charles,\" Tim Kelly said.\n\"There's nothing but boys altogether, white and black. Does it stand\nto reason that a lot of gossoons, who haven't learnt the goose step,\nand haven't as much as a shred of faith, ayther in themselves or their\nofficers, are fit to fight the French?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, Tim,\" Charlie said. \"Boys are just as plucky as\nmen, in their way, and are ready to do all sorts of foolhardy things,\nwhich men would hesitate to attempt.\"\n\n\"And that is so, Mr. Charles, when they've only other boys to dale\nwith; but as they're growing up, they take some time before they're\nquite sure they're a match for men. That's what it is, yer honor, I\ntell ye, and you will see it, soon.\"\n\nTim's predictions were speedily verified. The very morning after they\narrived before the fort, the garrison made a sally, fell upon the\ntroops, and killed one of their officers.\n\nThe whole of the new levies took to their heels, and fled away from\nthe fight. Clive, with his three officers, threw himself among them\nand, for some time, in vain attempted to turn the tide. It was not,\nindeed, until several had been cut down that the rout was arrested,\nand they were brought back to their duty.\n\nA day or two later a shot, striking a rock, killed or wounded fourteen\nmen; and excited such a panic, that it was some time before the rest\nwould venture near the front.\n\nThe enemy, with a considerable force, marched from Chengalpatt to\nrelieve the place. Clive left half his force to continue the siege,\nand with the rest marched out and offered battle to the relieving\nforce. Daring and confidence, as usual, prevailed. Had the enemy\nattacked, there is little doubt they would have put Clive's raw levies\nto flight. They were, however, cowed by his attitude of defiance, and\nretreated hastily.\n\nThe governor of Covelong at once lost heart and surrendered the place;\nwhich he might have maintained, for months, against the force before\nit; and on the fourth day of the siege, capitulated.\n\nA few hours afterwards the enemy from Chengalpatt, ignorant of the\nfall of the fort, again advanced; and Clive met them with his whole\nforce. Taken by surprise, they suffered heavily. Clive pursued them to\nthe gates of their fort, to which he at once laid siege.\n\nFortunately for the English, the commander of this place, like him of\nCovelong, was cowardly and incapable. Had it not been so, the fort,\nwhich was very strong, well provisioned, and well garrisoned, might\nhave held out for an indefinite time. As it was, it surrendered on the\nfourth day, and Clive took possession on the 31st of August.\n\nHe returned to Madras, and there, a short time afterwards, married\nMiss Maskelyne. Finding his health, however, continuing to\ndeteriorate, he sailed for Europe in February, 1753. It was but five\nyears since he had first taken up arms to defend Fort Saint David, an\nunknown clerk, without prospects and without fortune, utterly\ndiscontented and disheartened.\n\nMadras was in the hands of the French. Everywhere their policy was\ntriumphant, and the soil surrounded by the walls of Saint David's,\nalone, remained to the English in Southern India. In the five years\nwhich had elapsed, all had changed. The English were masters of the\nCarnatic. The French were broken and discredited. The English were\nregarded by the natives throughout the country as the coming power;\nand of this great change, no slight portion was due to the energy and\ngenius of Clive, himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. An Important Mission.\n\n\nA few days after the return of the expedition against Covelong and\nChengalpatt, Charlie received a note from Governor Saunders,\nrequesting him to call upon him at eleven o'clock. Charlie, of course,\nattended at Government House at the time named, and found Captain\nClive with Mr. Saunders.\n\n\"I have sent for you, Mr. Marryat, to ask you if you are ready to\nundertake a delicate, and somewhat dangerous, mission. Captain Clive\ntells me that he is convinced that you will be able to discharge the\nduties satisfactorily. He has been giving me the highest report of\nyour conduct and courage, and he tells me that you speak the language\nwith some facility.\"\n\n\"I have been working hard, sir,\" Charlie said, \"and have had a\nmoonshee for the last year; and as, except when on duty, I have spoken\nnothing but the native language with him, I can now speak it almost as\nfluently as I can English.\"\n\n\"So Captain Clive has been telling me,\" Mr. Saunders said; \"and it is,\nindeed, on that ground that I select you for the service. Your friend\nMr. Peters has equally distinguished himself in the field, Captain\nClive tells me, but he is greatly your inferior in his knowledge of\nthe vernacular.\"\n\nThis was indeed the case. Peters had but little natural aptitude for\nforeign languages; and after working hard, for a time, with the\nmoonshee, he found that he was making so little progress, in\ncomparison with Charlie, that he lost heart; and although he had\ncontinued his lessons with the moonshee, he had done so only to the\nextent of an hour or so a day, whereas Charlie had devoted his whole\nleisure time to the work.\n\n\"The facts of the case are these, Mr. Marryat. Owing to the failure,\nof Muhammud Ali, to fulfil the ridiculously onerous terms extorted\nfrom him, by some of his native allies, during the siege of\nTrichinopoli, several of them are in a state of discontent, which is\nlikely soon to break out into open hostilities. The Rajahs of Mysore\nand Tanjore are, I have learned, already in communication with\nPondicherry; and will, I believe, shortly acknowledge the son of\nChunda Sahib, whom Dupleix has declared ruler of the Carnatic. Murari\nReo has already openly joined the French. Their influence in the\nDeccan is now so great that Bussy may be said to rule there.\n\n\"Now, there is a chief named Boorhau Reo, whose territory lies among\nthe hills, and extends from the plain nearly up to the plateau land of\nthe Deccan. His position, like that of many of the other small rajahs,\nis precarious. In days like the present, when might makes right, and\nevery petty state tries to make profit out of the constant wars, at\nthe expense of its neighbour, the position of a chief, surrounded by\nhalf a dozen others more powerful than himself, is by no means\npleasant. Boorhau Reo feels that he is in danger of being swallowed,\nby the nizam or by the Mahrattas, and he earnestly desires to ally\nhimself with us; believing, as he says, that we are destined to be\nmasters here. I have assured him that, although gratified at his\nexpressions of friendship, we can enter into no alliance with him. The\nposition of his territory would enable him to be of great assistance\nto us, in any war in which the whole force of the Deccan, controlled\nas it is at present at Bussy, might be utilized against us in the\nCarnatic. He would be able to harass convoys, cut communications, and\notherwise trouble the enemy's movements. But, although we see that his\naid would be very useful to us, in case of such a war; we do not see\nhow, on our part, we could give him any protection. We have now, with\nthe greatest difficulty, brought affairs to a successful conclusion in\nthe Carnatic; but Dupleix is active and energetic, and well supported\nat home. Many of the chiefs lately our allies have, as I have just\nsaid, declared against us, or are about to do so; and it is out of the\nquestion, for us to think of supporting a chief so far removed from us\nas Boorhau. I have, therefore, told him that we greatly desire his\nfriendship, but are at present powerless to protect him, should he be\nattacked by his northern neighbours.\n\n\"He is particularly anxious to train his men after the European\nfashion, as he sees that our Sepoys are a match for five times their\nnumber of the untrained troops of the Indian princes.\n\n\"This brings me to the subject before us. I have written to him, to\nsay that I will send to him an English officer, capable of training\nand leading his troops, and whose advice may be useful to him upon all\noccasions; but that as, were it known that he had received a British\nofficer, and was employing him to train his troops, it would excite\nthe instant animosity of Bussy and of the Peishwar; I should send one\nfamiliar with the language, and who may pass as a native. Captain\nClive has strongly recommended you for this difficult mission.\"\n\n\"I fear, sir, that I could hardly pass as a native. The moonshee is\nconstantly correcting mistakes which I make, in speaking.\"\n\n\"That may be so,\" Mr. Saunders said; \"but there are a score of\ndialects in Southern India, and you could be passed upon nineteen of\nthe twenty peoples who speak them, as belonging to one of the other.\"\n\n\"If you think, sir, that I shall do,\" Charlie said; \"I shall be glad\nto undertake the mission.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Marryat, that is understood, then. You will receive\nfull instructions in writing, and will understand that your duty is\nnot only to drill the troops of this chief; but to give him such\nadvice as may suit his and our interests; to strengthen his good\nfeeling towards us; and to form, as far as possible, a compact little\nforce which might, at a critical moment, be of immense utility. You\nwill, of course, master the geography of the country, of which we are\nall but absolutely ignorant; find out about the passes, the mountain\npaths, the defensible positions. All these things may someday be of\nthe highest importance.\n\n\"You will have a few days to make your arrangements, and settle as to\nthe character you will adopt. This you had better do, in consultation\nwith someone who thoroughly understands the country. It is intended\nthat you shall go down to Trichinopoli, with the next convoy; and from\nthere make your way to the stronghold of Boorhau.\"\n\n\"Shall I take any followers with me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Saunders said. \"As you will go in the character of a\nmilitary adventurer, who has served among our Sepoys long enough to\nlearn European drill, you had better take two, three, or four men, as\nyou like, with you as retainers. You might pick out two or three\ntrusty men, from the Sepoys you command.\"\n\nCharlie left Government House in high spirits. It was certainly an\nhonor, to have been selected for such a post. It was quite possible\nthat it would be a dangerous one. It was sure to be altogether\ndifferent from the ordinary life of a subaltern in the Company's army.\n\nPeters was very sorry when he heard from Charlie that they were, at\nlast, to be separated. It was now nearly two years since they had\nfirst met on board the Lizzie Anderson; and, since that time, they had\nbeen constantly together, and were greatly attached to each other.\n\nCharlie, perhaps, had taken the lead. The fact of his having a stock\nof firearms, and being able to lend them to Peters, had given him,\nperhaps, the first slight and almost imperceptible advantage. His feat\nof jumping overboard, to rescue Tim Kelly, had been another step in\nadvance; and, although Charlie would have denied it himself, there was\nno doubt that he generally took the lead, and that his friend was\naccustomed to lean upon him, and to look to him always for the\ninitiative. It was, therefore, a severe blow to Peters, to find that\nCharlie was about to be sent on detached service.\n\nAs for Tim Kelly, he was uproarious in his grief, when he heard that\nhe was to be separated from his master.\n\n\"Shure, Mr. Charlie, ye'll never have the heart to lave a poor boy,\nthat sarved ye be night and day for eighteen months. Tim Kelly would\ngladly give his life for ye, and ye wouldn't go and lave him behind\nye, and go all alone among these black thaves of the world.\"\n\n\"But it is impossible that I can take you, Tim,\" Charlie said. \"You\nknow, yourself, that you cannot speak ten words of the language. How\nthen could you possibly pass undetected, whatever disguise you put\non?\"\n\n\"But I'd never open my mouth at all, at all, yer honor, barring for\nmate and drink.\"\n\n\"It's all very well for you to say so, Tim,\" Charlie answered; \"but I\ndo not think that anything, short of a miracle, would silence your\ntongue. But leave us now, Tim, and I will talk the matter over with\nMr. Peters. I should be glad enough to have you with me, if we could\narrange it.\"\n\nThe moonshee was taken into their counsels, and was asked his opinion\nas to the disguise which Charlie could adopt, with least risk of\ndetection. The moonshee replied that he might pass as a Bheel. These\nhill tribes speak a dialect quite distinct from that of the people\naround them, and the moonshee said that, if properly attired, Charlie\nwould be able to pass anywhere for one of these people; provided,\nalways, that he did not meet with another of the same race.\n\n\"You might assert,\" he said, \"that your father had taken service with\nsome rajah on the plain, and that you had there learned to speak the\nlanguage. In this way, you would avoid having to answer any difficult\nquestions regarding your native place; but as to that, you can get up\nsomething of the geography before you leave.\"\n\n\"There are several Bheels among our Sepoys,\" Charlie said. \"I can pick\nout three or four of them, who would be just the men for me to take. I\nbelieve they are generally very faithful, and attached to their\nofficers.\"\n\nWhen Tim again entered the room, he inquired anxiously if his master\nhit upon any disguise which would suit him.\n\n\"What do you say, Mr. Moonshine?\" Tim said.\n\nThe moonshee shook his head. Between these two a perpetual feud had\nexisted, ever since the native had arrived at Arcot, to take his place\nas a member of Charlie's establishment. In obedience to Charlie's\nstringent orders, Tim never was openly rude to him; but he never lost\nan opportunity of making remarks, of a disparaging nature, as to the\nvalue of Charlie's studies.\n\nThe moonshee, on his part, generally ignored Tim's existence\naltogether; addressing him, when obliged to do so, with a ceremonious\ncivility which annoyed Tim more than open abuse would have done.\n\n\"I think,\" he said gravely, in reply to Tim's demand; \"that the very\nworshipful one would have most chance of escaping detection if he went\nin rags, throwing dust on his hair, and passing for one afflicted.\"\n\n\"And what does he mean by afflicted, Mr. Charles?\" the Irishman said\nwrathfully, as the two young officers laughed.\n\n\"He means one who is a born fool, Tim.\"\n\nTim looked furiously at the moonshee.\n\n\"It would,\" the latter said sententiously, \"be the character which the\nworshipful one would support with the greatest ease.\"\n\n\"The black thief is making fun of me,\" Tim muttered; \"but I'll be aven\nwith him one of these days, or my name isn't Tim Kelly.\n\n\"I was thinking, yer honor, that I might represent one deaf and dumb.\"\n\n\"But you're always talking, Tim, and when you're not talking to\nothers, you talk to yourself. It's quite impossible you could go as a\ndumb man; but you might go, as the moonshee suggests, as a half-witted\nsort of chap; with just sense enough to groom a horse and look after\nhim, but with not enough to understand what's said to you, or to\nanswer any questions.\"\n\n\"I could do that asy enough, Mr. Charles.\"\n\n\"And you have to keep from quarrelling, Tim. I hear you quarrelling,\non an average, ten times a day; and as, in such a character as we're\ntalking about, you would, of course, be exposed to all sorts of\nslights and unpleasantnesses, you would be in continual hot water.\"\n\n\"Now, yer honor,\" Tim said reproachfully, \"you're too hard on me,\nentirely. I like a bit of a row as well as any many, but it's all for\ndivarsion; and I could go on, for a year, without quarrelling with a\nsoul. Just try me, Mr. Charles. Just try me for a month, and if, at\nthe end of that time, you find me in your way; or that I don't keep my\ncharacter, then send me back agin to the regiment.\"\n\nIt was arranged that the moonshee should remain with Peters, who,\nseeing that Charlie owed his appointment, to a post which promised\nexcitement and adventure, to his skill in the native languages, was\ndetermined that he would again set to, in earnest, and try and master\nits intricacies. The moonshee went down to the bazaar, and purchased\nthe clothes which would be necessary for the disguises; and Charlie\nfound, in his company, four Sepoys who willingly agreed to accompany\nhim, in the character of his retainers, upon his expedition. As to\ntheir costume, there was no difficulty. When off duty, the Sepoys in\nthe Company's service were accustomed to dress in their native attire.\nConsequently, it needed only the addition of a tulwar, or short curved\nsword; a shield, thrown over one shoulder; a long matchlock; and two\nor three pistols and daggers, stuck into a girdle, to complete their\nequipment.\n\nCharlie himself was dressed gaily, in the garb of a military officer\nin the service of an Indian rajah. He was to ride, and a horse,\nsaddle, and gay housings were procured. He had, at last, given in to\nTim's entreaties; and that worthy was dressed as a syce, or horse\nkeeper.\n\nBoth Charlie and Tim had had those portions of their skin exposed to\nthe air darkened, and both would pass muster, at a casual inspection.\nCharlie, in thus concealing his nationality, desired only to hide the\nfact that he was an officer in the Company's service. He believed that\nit would be impossible for him to continue to pass as a Bheel. This,\nhowever, would be of no consequence, after a time. Many of the native\nprinces had Europeans in their service. Runaway sailors, deserters\nfrom the English, French, and Dutch armed forces in their possessions\non the seacoast, adventurers influenced either by a love of a life of\nexcitement, or whom a desire to escape the consequences of folly or\ncrime committed at home had driven to a roving life--such men might be\nfound in many of the native courts.\n\nOnce settled, then, in the service of the rajah, Charlie intended to\nmake but little farther pretence, or secrecy, as to his nationality.\nOutwardly, he would still conform to the language and appearance of\nthe character he had chosen; but he would allow it to be supposed that\nhe was an Englishman, a deserter from the Company's service, and that\nhis comrades were Sepoys in a similar position. His employment, then,\nat the court of the rajah, would have an effect the exact reverse of\nthat which it would have done, had he appeared in his proper\ncharacter.\n\nDeserters were, of all men, the most opposed to their countrymen, to\nwhom they had proved traitors. In battle they could be relied upon to\nfight desperately, for they fought with ropes round their necks.\nTherefore, while the appearance of an English officer, as instructor\nof the forces of the rajah, would have drawn upon himself the instant\nhostility of all opposed to the British; the circulation of a report\nthat his troops were being disciplined by some English and native\ndeserters, from the Company's forces, would excite no suspicion\nwhatever.\n\nTo avoid attracting attention, Charlie Marryat and his party set out\nbefore daylight from Madras. Their appearance, indeed, would have\nattracted no attention, when they once had passed beyond the\nboundaries of the portion of the town occupied by the whites. In the\nnative quarter, the appearance of a small zemindar, or landowner,\nattended by four or five armed followers on foot, was of such common\noccurrence as to attract no attention whatever; and, indeed, numbers\nof these come in to take service in the Sepoy regiments, the\nprofession of arms being always considered honorable, in India.\n\nFor a fortnight they travelled, by easy stages, without question or\nsuspicion being excited that they were not what they seemed. They were\nnow among the hills, and soon arrived at Ambur, the seat of the rajah.\nThe town was a small one, and above it rose the fortress, which stood\non a rock rising sheer from the bottom of the valley, and standing\nboldly out from the hillside. The communication was effected by a\nshoulder which, starting from a point halfway up the rock, joined the\nhill behind it. Along this shoulder were walls and gateways. An enemy\nattacking these would be exposed to the fire from the summit of the\nrock. From the point where the shoulder joined the rock, a zigzag road\nhad been cut, with enormous labour, in the face of the rock, to the\nsummit.\n\n\"It is a strong place,\" Charlie said to Tim Kelly, who was walking by\nhis horse's head; \"and should be able to hold out against anything but\nstarvation. That is to say, if properly defended.\"\n\n\"It's a powerful place, surely,\" Tim said; \"and would puzzle the ould\nboy himself to take. Even Captain Clive, who is afeard of nothing,\nwould be bothered by it.\"\n\nAs they rode up the valley, two horsemen were seen spurring towards\nthem, from the town. They drew rein before Charlie; and one, bowing,\nsaid:\n\n\"My master, the rajah, sends his greeting to you, and begs to know if\nyou are the illustrious soldier, Nadir Ali, for whom his heart has\nbeen longing.\"\n\n\"Will you tell your lord that Nadir Ali is here,\" Charlie said, \"and\nthat he longs to see the face of the rajah.\"\n\nOne of the horsemen at once rode off, and the other took his place by\nthe side of Charlie; and, having introduced himself as captain of the\nrajah's bodyguard, rode with him through the town.\n\nHad Charlie appeared in his character as English officer, the rajah\nand all his troops would have turned out to do honor to his arrival.\nAs it was, a portion of the garrison, only, appeared at the gate and\nlined the walls. Through these the little party passed, and up the\nsharp zigzags, which were so steep that, had it not been that his\ndignity prevented him from dismounting, Charlie would gladly have got\noff and proceeded on foot; for it was as much as the animal could do,\nto struggle up the steep incline.\n\nAt each turn there was a gateway, with little flanking towers; on\nwhich jingalls, or small wall pieces, commanded the road.\n\n\"Faith, then, it's no fool that built this place. I shouldn't like to\nhave to attack it, wid all the soldiers of the King's army, let alone\nthose of the Company.\"\n\n\"It is tremendously strong, Tim, but it is astonishing what brave men\ncan do.\"\n\nIn the after wars which England waged, in India, the truth of what\nCharlie said was over and over again proved. Numerous fortresses,\nsupposed by the natives to be absolutely impregnable, and far\nexceeding in strength that just described, have been carried by\nassault, by the dash and daring of English troops.\n\nThey gained, at last, the top of the rock. It was uneven in surface,\nsome portions being considerably more elevated than others. Roughly,\nits extent was about a hundred yards, either way. The lower level was\ncovered with buildings, occupied by the garrison, and storehouses. On\nthe upper level, some forty feet higher, stood the palace of the\nrajah. It communicated with the courtyard, below, by a broad flight of\nsteps. These led to an arched gateway, with a wall and battlements;\nforming an interior line of defence, should an assailant gain a\nfooting in the lower portion of the stronghold.\n\nAlighting from his horse at the foot of the steps, Charlie, followed\nby his five retainers, mounted to the gateway. Here another guard of\nhonor was drawn up. Passing through these, they entered a shady\ncourtyard, on one side of which was a stone pavilion. The flat ceiling\nwas supported by massive columns, closely covered with intricate\nsculpture. The roof was arabesqued with deeply cut patterns, picked\nout in bright colours. A fountain played in the middle.\n\nOn the farther side the floor, which was of marble, was raised; and\ntwo steps led to a wide recess, with windows of lattice stonework,\ngiving a view over the town and valley below. In this recess were\npiles of cushions and carpets, and here reclined the rajah, a spare\nand active-looking man, of some forty years old. He rose, as Charlie\napproached, the soldiers and Sepoys remaining beyond the limits of the\npavilion.\n\n\"Welcome, brave Nadir Ali,\" he said courteously; \"my heart is glad,\nindeed, at the presence of one whose wisdom is said to be far beyond\nhis years, and who has learned the arts of war of the infidels from\nbeyond the seas.\"\n\nThen, inviting Charlie to take a seat on the divan with him, he\nquestioned him as to his journey, and the events which were taking\nplace in the plains; until the attendants, having handed round\nrefreshments, retired at his signal.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Sahib,\" he said, when they were alone; \"though,\nin truth, I looked for one older than yourself. The great English\ngovernor of Madras tells me, however, in a letter which I received\nfour days since, that you are skilled in war; that you fought by the\nside of that great Captain Clive at Arcot, Arni, Kavaripak, and at\nTrichinopoli; and that the great warrior, himself, chose you to come\nto me. Therefore, I doubt neither your valour nor your prudence, and\nput myself in your hands, wholly.\n\n\"The governor has already told you, doubtless, of the position in\nwhich I am placed here.\"\n\n\"Governor Saunders explained the whole position to me,\" Charlie said.\n\"You are, at present, menaced on all sides by powerful neighbours. You\nbelieve that the fortunes of the English are on the increase; and as\nyou think the time may come, ere long, when they will turn the French\nout of the Deccan, and become masters there, as they have already\nbecome masters in the Carnatic, you wish to fight by their side, and\nshare their fortunes. In the meantime, you desire to be able to defend\nyourself against your neighbours; for, at present, the English are too\nfar away to assist you.\n\n\"To enable you to do this, I have been sent to drill and discipline\nyour troops, like our Sepoys; and to give you such advice as may be\nbest, for the general defence of your country. I have brought with me\nfive soldiers; four Bheels, and one of my countrymen. The latter will\nbe of little use in drilling your troops, for he is ignorant of the\nlanguage, and has come as my personal attendant. The other four will\nassist me in my work.\n\n\"Your followers here will, no doubt, discover in a very short time\nthat I am an Englishman. Let it be understood that I am a deserter,\nthat I have been attracted to your court by the promise of high pay,\nand that I have assumed the character of a Bheel, lest my being here\nmight put you on bad terms with the English.\"\n\nCharlie then asked the rajah as to the strength of his military force.\n\n\"In time of peace,\" the rajah said, \"I keep three hundred men under\narms. In case of taking the field, three thousand. To defend Ambur\nagainst an attack of an enemy, I could muster ten thousand men.\"\n\n\"You could not call out three thousand men, without attracting the\nattention of your neighbours?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"No,\" the rajah said; \"that would bring my neighbours upon me, at\nonce.\"\n\n\"I suppose, however, you might assemble another five hundred men,\nwithout attracting attention.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the rajah said; \"eight hundred men are not a force which\ncould attract any great attention.\"\n\n\"Then I should propose that we begin with eight hundred,\" Charlie\nsaid. \"For a month, however, I will confine myself to the troops you\nat present have. We must, in the first place, train some officers. If\nyou will pick out those to whom you intend to give commands, and\nsubcommands; I will choose from the men, after drilling them for a few\ndays, forty of the most intelligent as what we call noncommissioned\nofficers.\n\n\"For the first month, we will work hard in teaching these officers and\nsub-officers their duties. Then, when the whole eight hundred\nassemble, we can divide them into four parties. There will be one of\nmy drill instructors to each party, ten under officers, and four or\nfive of the officers whom you will appoint. Six weeks' hard work\nshould make these eight hundred men fairly acquainted with drill. The\nEnglish Sepoys have often gone out to fight, with less. At the end of\nthe six weeks, let the five hundred men you have called out, in\naddition to your bodyguard of three hundred, return to their homes;\nand replace them by an equal number of fresh levies, and so proceed\nuntil you have your three thousand fighting men, thoroughly trained.\nIn nine months, all will have had their six weeks of exercise, and\ncould take their places in the ranks again, at a day's notice.\n\n\"Two hundred of your men I will train in artillery; although I do not\nbelong to that branch of the service, I learned the duties at Arcot.\"\n\nThe rajah agreed, heartily, to Charlie's proposals; well pleased at\nthe thought that he should, before the end of a year, be possessed of\na trained force, which would enable him to hold his own against his\npowerful neighbours, until an opportunity might occur when, in\nalliance with the English, he should be able to turn the tables upon\nthem, and to aggrandize himself at their expense.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. A Murderous Attempt.\n\n\nHandsome rooms, with a suite of attendants, were assigned to Charlie\nin the rajah's palace; and he was formally appointed commander of his\nforces. The four Sepoys were appointed to junior ranks, as was also\nTim Kelly; who, however, insisted on remaining in the position of\nchief attendant upon his master; being, in fact, a sort of majordomo\nand valet in one, looking after his comforts when in the palace, and\naccompanying him as personal guard whenever he rode out.\n\n\"You niver know, yer honor, what these natives may be up to. They'll\nsmile with you one day, and stab ye the next. They're treacherous\nvarmint, yer honor, if you do but give 'em the chance.\"\n\nAt first, Charlie perceived that his position excited some jealousy in\nthe minds of those surrounding the rajah. He therefore did all in his\npower to show to them that he, in no way, aspired to interfere in the\ninternal politics or affairs of the little state--that he was a\nsoldier and nothing more. He urged upon the rajah, who wished to have\nhim always by him, that it was far better that he should appear to\nhold aloof, and to avoid all appearance of favouritism, or of a desire\nto obtain dominance in the counsels of the rajah. He wished that the\nappointments to the posts of officers in the new force should be made\nby the rajah, who should lend an ear to the advice of his usual\ncouncillors; but that, once appointed, they should be under his\nabsolute command and control, and that he should have power to dismiss\nthose who proved themselves indolent and incapable, to promote active\nand energetic men, wholly regardless of influence or position.\n\nThe next morning, Charlie and his four assistants set to work to drill\nthe three hundred men of the garrison, taking them in parties of\ntwenty. They were thus able, in the course of a few days, to pick out\nthe most active and intelligent for the sub-officers; and these, with\nthe existing officers of the body, and the new ones appointed by the\nrajah, were at once taken in hand to be taught their duty.\n\nFor a month, the work went on steadily and without interruption, and\nfrom morn till night the courtyard echoed with the words of command.\nAt the end of that time, the twenty officers and forty sub-officers\nhad fairly learned their duty. The natives of India are very quick in\nlearning drill, and a regiment of newly-raised Sepoys will perform\nmanoeuvres and answer to words of command, in the course of a\nfortnight, as promptly and regularly as would one of English recruits\nin three months.\n\nA good many changes had taken place during the month's work. Many of\nthe officers became disgusted with hard and continuous work, to which\nthey were unaccustomed, while some of the sub-officers showed a\ndeficiency of the quickness and intelligence needed for the work.\nTheir places, however, were easily filled, and as the days went on,\nall took an increasing degree of interest, as they acquired facility\nof movement, and saw how quickly, according to the European methods,\nmanoeuvres were gone through. At the end of a month, then, the sixty\nmen were able in turn to instruct others; and, a body of five hundred\nmen being called out, the work of drilling on a large scale began.\n\nThe drill ground now was a level space in the valley below the town,\nand the whole population assembled, day after day, to look on with\nastonishment at the exercises. The four great companies, or\nbattalions, as Charlie called them, were kept entirely separate, each\nunder the command of one of the Sepoys, under whom were a proportion\nof the officers and sub-officers. Every evening, Charlie came down for\nan hour, and put each body through its drill, distributing blame or\npraise as it was deserved, thus keeping up a spirit of emulation\nbetween the battalions. At the end of a fortnight, when the simpler\nmanoeuvres had been learned, Charlie, for two hours each day, worked\nthe whole together as one regiment; and was surprised, himself, to\nfind how rapid was the progress which each day effected.\n\nThe rajah himself often came down to the drill ground, and took the\nhighest interest in the work. He himself would fain have had regular\nuniforms, similar to those worn by the Sepoys in the service of the\nEuropean powers, provided for the men; but Charlie strongly urged him\nnot to do so. He admitted that the troops would look immensely better,\nif clad in regular uniform; than as a motley band, each dressed\naccording to his own fancy. He pointed out, however, that while the\nnews that the rajah was having some of his men drilled by European\ndeserters would attract but little attention among his neighbours, the\nreport that he was raising Sepoy battalions would certainly be\nreceived by them in a hostile spirit.\n\n\"By all means,\" Charlie said, \"get the uniforms made for the whole\nforce, and keep them by you in store. They can be at once served out\nin case of war, and the sight of a number of Sepoy battalions, where\nthey expected only to meet an irregular force, will have an immense\neffect upon any force opposed to you.\"\n\nThe rajah saw the force of this argument, and at once ordered five\nthousand suits of white uniforms, similar to those worn by the Sepoys\nin the English and French service, to be made and stored up in the\nmagazines.\n\nWhile his lieutenants were drilling the main body, Charlie himself\ntook in hand a party of forty picked men, and instructed them in the\nuse of field guns. The superiority of Europeans in artillery was one\nof the reasons which gave to them such easy victory, in their early\nbattles with the native forces in India. The latter possessed a very\npowerful artillery, in point of numbers, but there was no regular\ndrill nor manner of loading. They were in the habit, too, of allowing\neach gun to cool after it was fired, before being loaded again. It was\nthought, therefore, good practice if a gun were discharged once in a\nquarter of an hour. They were, then, utterly astounded and dismayed at\nthe effects of the European guns, each of which could be loaded and\nfired twice, or even three times, a minute.\n\nSo month passed after month, until Rajah Boorhau was in a position to\nput, if necessary, five battalions of Sepoys, each seven hundred\nstrong, into the field; with thirty guns, served by trained\nartillerymen. So quietly had the work gone on, that it attracted no\nattention among his neighbours. The mere rumour that the rajah had\nsome European deserters in his service, and that these were drilling\nfour or five hundred men, was considered of so little moment that it\npassed altogether unheeded.\n\nThe accounts of the state of affairs in the Carnatic, which reached\nCharlie, were not satisfactory--Dupleix, with his usual energy, was\naiding the son of Chunda Sahib, with men and money, in his combat with\nthe British protege; and most of the native allies of the latter had\nfallen away from him. Trichinopoli was again besieged, and the\nfortunes of England, lately so flourishing, were waning again. In the\nDeccan, French influence was supreme. Bussy, with a strong and\nwell-disciplined French force, maintained Salabut Jung, whom the\nFrench had placed on the throne, against all opponents. At one time it\nwas the Peishwar, at another the Mahrattas against whom Bussy turned\nhis arms; and always with success, and the French had acquired the\nfour districts on the coast, known as the Northern Sircas.\n\nIt was in vain that Charlie endeavoured to gain an accurate knowledge\nof the political position, so quickly and continually did this change.\nAt one time the Peishwar and the Nizam, as the Subadar of the Deccan\nwas now called, would be fighting in alliance against one or other of\nthe Mahratta chiefs. At another time they would be in conflict with\neach other, while the Rajah of Mysore, Murari Reo, and other chiefs\nwere sometimes fighting on one side, sometimes on another.\n\nProud of his rapidly increasing force, Boorhau Reo would, more than\nonce in the course of the year, have joined in the warfare going on\naround. Charlie, however, succeeded in restraining him from doing so;\npointing out that the victor of one day was the vanquished of the\nnext, and that it was worse than useless to join in a struggle of\nwhich the conditions were so uncertain, and the changes of fortune so\nrapid, that none could count upon others for aid, however great the\nassistance they might have rendered only a short time before.\n\n\"Were you to gain territory, Rajah, which you might, perhaps, largely\ndo, from the efficient aid which you might render to one party or the\nother, you would be the object of a hostile combination against which\nyou could not hope to struggle.\"\n\nThe rajah yielded at once to Charlie's arguments; but the influence of\nthe latter added to the hostility, which the favour shown him by the\nrajah had provoked, among many of the leading men of the state. Where\nthe sides were often so closely balanced as was the case in these\nintestine struggles, the aid of every rajah, however small his\nfollowing, was sought by one or other of the combatants; and the\ncounsellors of those able to place a respectable force in the field\nwere heavily bribed, by one side or the other. Those around Rajah\nBoorhau found their efforts completely baffled by the influence of the\nEnglish commander of his forces, and a faction of increasing strength\nand power was formed to overthrow him. The rajah himself had kept his\nsecret well, and one or two, only, of his advisers knew that the\nEnglishman was a trusted agent of the Company.\n\nThe soldiers were much attached to their English leader. They found\nhim always just and firm. Complaints were always listened to, tyranny\nor ill treatment by the officers suppressed and punished, merit\nrewarded. Among the officers the strictness of the discipline\nalienated many, who contrasted the easy life which they had led before\nthe introduction of the European system, with that which they now\nendured. So long as they were engaged in mastering the rudiments of\ndrill they felt their disadvantage; but when this was acquired, each\nthought himself capable of taking the place of the English adventurer,\nand of leading the troops he had organized to victory. Already,\nCharlie had received several anonymous warnings that danger threatened\nhim. The rajah was, he knew, his warm friend; and he, in his delight\nat seeing the formidable force which had been formed from his\nirregular levies, had presented him, as a token of his gratitude, with\nlarge sums of money.\n\nIn those days, this was the method by which Indian princes rewarded\nEuropean officers who rendered them service, and it was considered by\nno means derogatory to the latter to accept the money. This was,\nindeed, the universal custom, and Charlie, knowing that Captain Clive\nhad received large presents of this kind, had no hesitation in\nfollowing his example. The treasures stored up by many of these Indian\nprinces were immense, and a lac of rupees, equivalent to ten thousand\npounds, was considered by no means a large present. Charlie,\nforeseeing that, sooner or later, the little state would become\ninvolved in hostilities, took the precaution of forwarding the money\nhe had received down to Madras; sending it piecemeal, in charge of\nnative merchants and traders. It was, by these, paid into the Madras\ntreasury, where a large rate of interest, for all monies lent by its\nemployees, was given by the Company.\n\nFor those at home he felt no uneasiness. It was very seldom that their\nletters reached him; but he learned that they were still in high\nfavour with his uncle, that his mother continued installed at the head\nof the house, and that the girls were both at excellent schools.\n\nCharlie mentioned, to the rajah, the rumours which had reached him of\na plot against him. The rajah assured him of his own support, under\nall circumstances, and offered that a strong guard should be placed,\nnight and day, over the apartments he occupied.\n\nThis Charlie declined.\n\n\"A guard can always be corrupted,\" he said. \"My Irish servant sleeps\nin my anteroom, my four lieutenants are close at hand, and knowing\nthat the soldiers are, for the most part, attached to me, I do not\nthink that open force will be used. I will, however, cause a large\nbell to be suspended above my quarters. Its ringing will be a signal\nthat I am attacked, in which case I rely upon your highness putting\nyourself at the head of the guard, and coming to my assistance.\"\n\nTim Kelly was at once furious and alarmed, at the news that danger\nthreatened his master, and took every precaution that he could imagine\nto ensure his safety. He took to going down to the town, himself, to\npurchase provisions; and, so far as possible, prepared these himself.\nHe procured two or three monkeys, animals which he held in horror, and\noffered them a portion of everything that came on the table, before he\nplaced it before his master.\n\nCharlie at first protested against this, as his dinner became cold by\nwaiting; but Tim had an oven prepared, and ordered dinner half an hour\nbefore the time fixed by his master. Each dish as brought in was,\nafter a portion had been given to a monkey, placed in the oven, and\nthus half an hour was given to allow the poison to work. This was done\nwithout Charlie's knowledge, the oven being placed in the anteroom,\nand the dishes thence brought in, in regular order, by the body\nservant, whom even Tim allowed to be devoted to his master.\n\nOne day, Charlie was just sitting down to his soup, when Tim ran in.\n\n\"For the love of Heaven, Mr. Charles, don't put that stuff to your\nmouth. It's pisoned, or, at any rate, if it isn't, one of the other\ndishes is.\"\n\n\"Poisoned, Tim! Nonsense, man. You are always thinking of poisonings\nand plots.\"\n\n\"And it's lucky for your honor that I am,\" Tim said. \"Jist come into\nthe next room, and look at the monkeys.\"\n\nCharlie went in. One of the little creatures was lying upon the\nground, evidently in a state of great agony. The other was sitting up,\nrocking itself backwards and forwards, like a human being in pain.\n\n\"They look bad, poor little beasts,\" Charlie said; \"but what has that\ngot to do with my soup?\"\n\n\"Shure, yer honor, isn't that jist what I keep the cratures for, just\nto give them a taste of everything yer honor has, and I claps it into\nthe oven there to kape it warm till I've had time to see, by the\nmonkeys, whether it's good.\"\n\n\"It looks very serious,\" Charlie said, gravely. \"Do you go quietly\nout, Tim, call two men from the guardhouse, and seize the cook; and\nplace one or two men as sentries over the other servants. I will go\nacross to the rajah.\"\n\nThe latter, on hearing what had happened, ordered the cook to be\nbrought before him, together with the various dishes prepared for the\ndinner. The man, upon being interrogated, vehemently denied all\nknowledge of the affair.\n\n\"We shall see,\" the rajah said. \"Eat up that plate of soup.\"\n\nThe man turned pale.\n\n\"Your highness will observe,\" he stammered, \"that you have already\ntold me that one of these dishes is poisoned. I cannot say which, and\nwhichever I eat may be the fatal one.\"\n\nThe rajah made a signal to him to obey his orders, but Charlie\ninterposed.\n\n\"There is something in what he says, your highness. Whether the man is\ninnocent or guilty, he would shrink equally from eating any of them.\nIt is really possible that he may know nothing of it. The poison may\nhave been introduced into the materials beforehand. If the man is\ntaken to a dungeon, I think I could suggest a plan by which we could\ntest him.\n\n\"I believe him to be guilty,\" he said, when the prisoner had been\nremoved.\n\n\"Then why not let him be beheaded at once?\" the rajah asked.\n\n\"I would rather let ten guilty men escape,\" Charlie replied, \"than run\nthe risk of putting one innocent one to death. I propose, sir, that\nyou order the eight dishes of food, which have been prepared for my\ndinner, to be carefully weighed. Let these be all placed in the cell\nof the prisoner, and there let him be left. In the course of two or\nthree days he will, if guilty, endeavour to assuage his hunger by\neating little bits of food, from every dish except that which he knows\nto be poisoned, but will take such a small portion from each that he\nwill think it will not be detected. If he is innocent, and is really\nignorant which dish is poisoned, he will not touch any of them, until\ndriven to desperation by hunger. Then he will seize on one or more,\nand devour them to the end, running the chance of death by poison,\nrather than endure the pangs of hunger longer.\"\n\n\"Your plan is a wise one,\" the rajah said. \"It shall be tried. Let the\ndishes be taken to him, every morning, and removed every evening. Each\nevening they shall be weighed.\"\n\nThese orders were carried out, and on the following morning the dishes\nwere placed in the cell of the prisoner. When removed at night, they\nwere found to be untouched. The next evening several of the dishes\nwere found to have lost some ounces in weight. The third evening all\nbut one had been tasted.\n\n\"Let the prisoner be brought in again,\" the rajah ordered, when\ninformed of this.\n\n\"Dog,\" he said, \"you have betrayed yourself. Had you been innocent,\nyou could not have known in which of the dishes the poison had been\nplaced. You have eaten of all but one. If that one contains poison,\nyou are guilty.\"\n\nThen, turning to an attendant, he ordered him to take a portion of the\nuntouched food, and to throw it to a dog. Pending the experiment, the\nprisoner was removed. Half an hour later, the attendant returned with\nthe news that the dog was dead.\n\n\"The guilt of the man is confirmed,\" the rajah said. \"Let him be\nexecuted.\"\n\n\"Will you give him to me, your highness?\" Charlie asked. \"His death\nwould not benefit me now, and to save his life, he may tell me who is\nmy enemy. It is of no use punishing the instrument, and letting the\ninstigator go free.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" the rajah agreed. \"If you can find out who bribed\nhim, justice shall be done, though it were the highest in the state.\"\n\nCharlie returned to his own quarters, assembled his lieutenants and\nseveral other of his officers, and had the man brought before him.\n\n\"Hossein,\" he said, \"you have taken money to take my life. I looked\nupon you as my faithful servant. I had done you no wrong. It has been\nproved that you attempted to poison me. You, when driven by hunger,\nate small quantities, which you thought would pass unobserved, of all\nthe dishes but one. That dish has been given to a dog, and he has\ndied. You knew, then, which was the poisoned dish. The rajah has\nordered your execution. I offer you life, if you will tell me who it\nwas that tempted you.\"\n\nThe prisoner preserved a stolid silence.\n\n\"We had better proceed to torture him, at once,\" one of the rajah's\nofficers said.\n\nThe man turned a little paler. He knew well the horrible tortures\nwhich would, in such an instance, be inflicted to extort the names of\nthose who had bribed him.\n\n\"I will say nothing,\" he said, firmly, \"though you tear me limb from\nlimb.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of torturing you,\" Charlie said. \"A confession\nextorted by pain is as likely to be false as true, and even did you\ntell me one name, there might still be a dozen engaged in it who would\nremain unknown. No, Hossein, you have failed in your duty, you have\ntried to slay a master who was kind to you, and trusted you.\"\n\n\"No, sahib,\" the man exclaimed, passionately. \"You did not trust me.\nThe food I sent you was tested and tried. I knew it; but I thought\nthat the poison would not have acted on the monkeys, until you had\neaten the dish. The fool who sold it me deceived me. Had you trusted\nme, I would never have done it. It was only when I saw that I was\nsuspected and doubted, without cause, that my heart turned against\nyou, and I took the gold which was offered to me to kill you. I swear\nit by the Prophet.\"\n\nCharlie looked at him steadily.\n\n\"I believe you,\" he said. \"You were mistaken. I had no suspicions. My\nservant feared for me, and took these precautions without telling me.\nHowever, Hossein, I pardon you, and if you will swear to me to be\nfaithful, in future, I will trust you. You shall again be my cook, and\nI will eat the food as you prepare it for me.\"\n\n\"I am my lord's slave,\" the man said in a low tone. \"My life is his.\"\n\nCharlie nodded, and the guard standing on either side of the prisoner\nstepped back, and without another word he left the room, a free man.\n\nCharlie's officers remonstrated with him upon having not only pardoned\nthe man, but restored him to his position of cook.\n\n\"I think I have done wisely,\" Charlie said. \"I must have a cook, for\nTim Kelly here is not famous that way; and although he might manage\nfor me, when alone, he certainly could not turn out a dinner which\nwould be suitable, when I have some of the rajah's kinsmen and\nofficers dining with me. Did I get another cook, he might be just as\nopen to the offers of my enemies as Hossein has been; and do you not\nthink that, after what has passed, Hossein will be less likely to take\nbribes than any other man?\"\n\nHenceforth the oven was removed from the antechamber, and Charlie took\nhis meals as Hossein prepared them for him. The man said little, but\nCharlie felt sure, from the glances that he cast at him, that he could\nrely upon Hossein now to the death.\n\nTim Kelly, who felt the strongest doubts as to the prudence of the\nproceeding, observed that Hossein no longer bought articles from men\nwho brought them up to sell to the soldiers, but that every morning he\nwent out early, and purchased all the supplies he desired from the\nshopkeepers in the town. Tim mentioned the fact to his master, who\nsaid:\n\n\"You see, Tim, Hossein has determined that I shall not be poisoned\nwithout his knowing it. The little peddlers who come up here with\nherbs, and spices, and the ingredients for curry, might be bribed to\nsell Hossein poisoned goods. By going down into the town, and buying\nin the open market, it is barely possible that the goods could be\npoisoned. You need have no more anxiety whatever, Tim, as to poison.\nIf the attempt is made again, it will probably be by sword or dagger.\"\n\n\"Well, yer honor,\" said Tim, \"anything's better than pison. I've got\nto sleep almost with one eye open. And you've got sentries outside\nyour windows. What a pity it is that we ain't in a climate where one\ncan fasten the windows, and boult the shutters! But now the wet season\nis over again, ye might have yer bed put, as ye did last year, on the\nroof of your room, with a canopy over it to keep off the dew. Ye would\nbe safe then, except from anyone coming through the room where I\nsleeps.\"\n\nCharlie's bedroom was at the angle of a wall, and on two sides he\ncould look down from his windows, two hundred feet, sheer into the\nvalley below. The view from the flat terraced roof was a charming one,\nand, as Tim said, Charlie had, in the fine weather, converted the\nterrace into a sleeping room. A broad canopy, supported by poles at\nthe corner, stretched over it, and even in the hottest weather the\nnights were not unpleasant here.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. An Attempt At Murder.\n\n\nThe house, of which the bedroom occupied by Charlie formed part, was\nelsewhere two stories higher; this room jutting out, alone, into the\nangle of the wall. The rest of the suite of rooms were in the house\nitself, but access could be obtained to this room through the window,\nwhich looked on to the terrace of the wall. Charlie's lieutenants\nalways took pains to place men upon whom they could thoroughly rely as\nsentries, on this terrace.\n\nOne night, a fortnight after the events which have been described,\nCharlie was asleep on his bed, on the flats above his room. On one\nside the house rose straight beside it. On two others was the fall to\nthe valley, on the fourth side was the wall, along which two sentries\nwere pacing to and fro. From time to time, from a door some distance\nalong the side of the house, opening on to the wall, a white figure\ncame out, stretched himself as if unable to sleep, looked for a while\nover the parapet down into the valley, appeared to listen intently,\nand then sauntered into the house again.\n\nIt was the cook, Hossein. It was his custom. Successive sentries had,\nfor many nights past, seen him do the same; but in a country where the\nnights are hot, a sleepless servant attracts but little attention.\nUpon the occasion of one of these visits to the parapet, he stood in\nan attitude of deep attention, longer than usual. Then he carelessly\nsauntered back. It was but a moment later that his face appeared at\nthe window next to that of Charlie's bedroom. He stretched his head\nout, and again listened intently. Then he went to Tim, who was\nsleeping heavily on a couch placed there, and touched him. He put his\nhand on his lips, as Tim sprang up.\n\n\"Take arm,\" he said, in Hindostanee. \"Bad man coming.\"\n\nTim understood the words and, seizing a sword and pistol which lay\nclose to the bedside, followed Hossein, who had glided up the stairs,\nwith a drawn tulwar in his hand. At the moment he did so, there was a\nnoise of heavy bodies dropping, followed by a sudden shout from\nCharlie. There was a sound of clashing of arms, and the report of a\npistol.\n\nAs Tim's eyes came on a level with the terrace, he saw Hossein bound\nwith uplifted blade into the midst of a group of men in the corner.\nThree times the blade rose and fell, and each time a loud shriek\nfollowed. Then he disappeared in the midst.\n\nTim was but a few seconds behind him. Discharging his pistol into the\nbody of one of the men, and running his sword into another, he, too,\nstood by the side of his master. Charlie, streaming with blood, was\nhalf sitting, half lying in the angle of the parapet. Hossein, his\nturban off, his long hair streaming down his back, was standing over\nhim, fighting furiously against some ten men, who still pressed\nforward, while several others lay upon the ground.\n\nIn spite of the arrival of Charlie's two allies, they still pressed\nforward, but the shots of the pistols had been echoed by the muskets\nof the sentries. Loud shouts were heard, showing that the alarm was\nsounding through the palace.\n\nOne more desperate effort the assailants made, to beat the two men who\nopposed them over the parapet, but Hossein and the Irishman stood\nfirm. The weight and numbers of their opponents, however, told upon\nthem; when the first of the sentries appeared upon the platform,\nfollowed closely by his comrade; and both, with levelled bayonets,\ncharged into the fray.\n\nThe assailants now thought only of escape, but their position was a\ndesperate one. Some rushed to the end of the terrace, and tried to\nclimb the ropes by which they had slid down from the upper roof of the\nhouse. Others endeavoured to rush down the staircase; but Tim, with\none of the sentries, guarded this point, until a rush of feet below\ntold that the guard were coming to their assistance.\n\nIt was well that help was at hand, for the conspirators, desperate at\nfinding themselves in a trap, gathering themselves together, rushed\nwith the fury of wild beasts upon Tim and the sentry. One was impaled\nupon a bayonet, another cut down by Tim, and then, borne back by the\nweight of their opponents, they were hurled backwards down the stairs.\nAs the assailants followed them with a rush, the guard sprang through\nthe open window, from the terrace below, into the room.\n\nThere was a short and desperate conflict. Then two of the conspirators\nbounded up the staircase on to the roof, ran to the parapet and leaped\nover into the valley, two hundred feet below. They were the last of\nthe eighteen men who had lowered themselves, from the roof above, to\nattack Charlie.\n\nAs soon as Tim picked himself up, he hastened to ascend the stairs\nagain, and to run to the side of his master. Charlie was insensible.\nLeaning against the parapet, too weak to stand, but still holding his\nsword, and ready to throw himself once more before him, stood Hossein;\nwho now, seeing Tim approach, and that all danger was over, dropped\nhis sword and sank upon the ground.\n\nA minute or two later the rajah himself, sword in hand, hurried up. He\nwas greatly concerned, and excited, at the sight which met his eyes.\nCharlie was at once lifted, and carried down to one of the rajah's own\nrooms, where he was instantly attended to.\n\nA hasty examination showed that only two of the attacking party still\nbreathed. None of those who had fallen above survived, so fiercely and\ndeadly had been the blows struck by Hossein and Tim. Charlie himself\nhad cut down one and shot another, before he fell, slashed in many\nplaces, just as Hossein bounded through his assailants.\n\nThe bodies of the dead were, by the rajah's orders, laid together for\nidentification in the morning. The two who still lived were carried to\nthe guardroom, and their wounds dressed, in order that the names of\ntheir employers might be obtained from them.\n\nIn the meantime, Charlie's lieutenants had hastily formed a body of\ntheir soldiers together, and these at once fell upon a number of men\nwho were crowding up the steps to the palace, with shouts of \"Death to\nthe Englishman.\" A few volleys poured among these effectually\nscattered them, and they broke and hurried down the steep road,\nthrough the gates to the town, the sentries on the way offering no\nopposition, but many falling under the fire from the parapet of the\nfort.\n\nIn ten minutes, all was over. The gates were again closed, and a\nstrong guard placed over them, and the attempted insurrection was at\nan end.\n\nThe native surgeon, who attended Charlie, pronounced that none of the\nfive wounds he had received, although for the most part severe, were\nnecessarily fatal; and that there was every chance of his recovery.\nHossein's wounds, three in number, were pronounced to be more\ndangerous, one being a deep stab in the body, given by a man who had\nrushed at him, as he was guarding the blow of another. Tim's wounds\nwere comparatively slight, and he suffered more from the bruises he\nhad received, when hurled backwards down the stone staircase. However,\nwith one arm in a sling, and his head bandaged, he was able to take\nhis place by his master's bedside.\n\nHaving heard, from him, that it was entirely due to Hossein that\nCharlie's life had been saved, the rajah directed that every attention\nshould be paid to him; and several times, during the night, Tim stole\naway to his bedside to press his hand, and call down blessings upon\nhim.\n\nThe stanching of his wounds, and the application of strong\nrestoratives, presently caused Charlie to open his eyes.\n\n\"The Lord be praised, Mr. Charles,\" Tim said, \"that you're coming to\nyourself again. Don't you trouble, sir. We've done for the murdhering\nrascals; and, plase God, you'll soon be about again. Jist drink this\ndraught, yer honor, and go off to sleep, if you can. In the morning\nI'll tell you all about it.\n\n\"You're in the rajah's own room,\" he continued, seeing Charlie's eyes\nwander wonderingly around him, \"and all you've got to do is just to\nlie still, and get well as soon as you can.\"\n\nIt was a fortnight before Charlie, still very weak and feeble, was\nable to totter from his room to that in which Hossein was lying. He\nhimself knew nothing of what had passed after he fell. The conflict\nhad, to him, been little more than a dream. Awakened from sleep by the\nsound of his assailants, as they dropped from the ropes, he had leaped\nup as a rush of figures came towards him, catching up his sword and\npistol as he did so. He had shot the first, and cut down the next who\nrushed at him, but at the same moment he had felt a sharp pain, and\nremembered no more.\n\nTim heard from Hossein, when the latter, two days after the fight, was\nable to speak, that he had suspected that some renewed attempt might\nbe made upon his master's life; and that for many nights he had not\nslept, contenting himself with such repose as he could snatch in the\ndaytime, between the intervals of preparing meals. A few minutes\nbefore the attack, he fancied he heard a movement on the roof of the\nhouse; and running to Charlie's room he had, from the window, seen\nsome dark figures sliding down the wall. Then he roused Tim, and\nrushed up to the rescue.\n\nTim eloquently described to his master the manner in which Hossein\nsprung upon his foes, and cut his way through, in time to drive back\nthose who were hacking at him as he lay prostrate; and how he found\nhim standing over him, keeping at bay the whole of his assailants.\n\nCharlie, with difficulty, made his way to the bedside of the brave\nMohammedan. The latter, however, did not know him. He was in the\ndelirium of fever. He was talking rapidly to himself.\n\n\"He trusted me,\" he said. \"He gave me my life. Should I not give mine\nfor him? Anyone else would have had me hung as a dog. I will watch. I\nwill watch. He shall see that Hossein is not ungrateful.\"\n\nCharlie's eyes filled with tears, as he looked at the wasted form of\nhis follower.\n\n\"Is there any hope for him?\" he asked the doctor.\n\n\"It is possible, just possible that he may live,\" the latter said.\n\"Allah only knows.\"\n\n\"Do all you can to save him,\" Charlie said. \"I shall be ever grateful\nto you, if you do.\"\n\nTim, now that his master could dispense with his services, transferred\nhis attentions to the bedside of Hossein, and was unremitting in the\ncare and attention with which he kept the bandages on his head cool\nwith fresh water, and wetted his hot lips with refreshing drinks. It\nwas another week before his illness took a turn. Then the fever left\nhim, and he lay weak and helpless as an infant. Strong soups now took\nthe place of the cooling drinks, and in a few days the native doctor\nwas able to say, confidently, that the danger was passed, and that\nHossein would recover.\n\nIn the meantime, the investigations of the rajah had brought to light\nthe details of the conspiracy. The wounded men had confessed that they\nwere employed by three of the principal persons at the rajah's court,\none of them being the rajah's brother. The information, however, was\nscarcely needed; as it was found, in the morning, that their\napartments were empty; they having fled with the men who had attacked\nthe gates of the palace. These consisted partly of soldiers whom they\nhad bribed, and of desperadoes from the town, who had singly entered\nthe fort during the day, and had been concealed in the apartments of\nthe conspirators, until the signal for attack was given.\n\nThe intention of the conspirators was not only to kill the Englishman,\nbut to dethrone the rajah, and install his brother in his place. The\nattack had commenced with the attempt upon Charlie's life, because it\nwas believed that his death would paralyse the troops who were\nfaithful to the rajah.\n\nAt the end of six weeks, Charlie was able to resume his duties, and\nhis appearance at the parade ground was hailed with enthusiastic\nshouts by the soldiers. The rajah was more attached to him than ever,\nand had again made him large presents, in token of the regret he felt\nat the sufferings he had endured in his cause.\n\nDrilling was now carried on with redoubled energy, and large numbers\nof new levies had been summoned to the standard. A storm was gathering\nover Ambur. The rajah's brother was raising a force to attack him, and\nhad, by means of large promises in case of success, persuaded Murari\nReo to take up his cause; and he had, it was said, also sent messages\nto the nizam, pointing out that, in case of war with the English, the\nRajah of Ambur would be a thorn in his side. He told of the numbers of\ntroops who had been drilled, and how formidable such a force would be,\nif opposed to him at a critical moment; while if he, the claimant,\ngained power, the army of Ambur would be at the disposal of the nizam.\n\nThe rajah, on his side, had also sent messengers to Hyderabad, with\nassurances to the nizam of his fidelity and friendship. He urged that\nthe preparations he had made were intended solely for the defence of\nhis state, against marauding bands of Mahrattas, and especially\nagainst those of Murari Reo, who was a scourge to all his neighbours.\n\nIn the meantime, every effort was made to strengthen the defences of\nAmbur. The walls surrounding the town were repaired, and although\nthese, in themselves, could have offered but a slight defence to a\ndetermined assault, the approaches to the town were all covered by the\nguns of the fort above.\n\nThe weak point of the defence was the hill behind the town. This\nsloped up, gradually, to a point higher than the level of the\nprojecting rock upon which the castle stood. It then rose, in rugged\ncliffs, some two hundred feet higher; and then fell away again,\nsteeply, to its summit. This was too far back for the fire of guns\nplaced upon it to injure the castle or town. Guns placed, however, at\nthe foot of the rocky wall, would dominate the castle and render it,\nat last, untenable.\n\nCharlie had often looked, with an anxious eye, at this point; and one\nmorning, accompanied by the rajah, he rode up to examine the position.\nThe highest point of the slope, at the foot of the crag, was nearly\nopposite the castle; and it was here that an active enemy, making his\nway along the slope, would place his guns. Here, Charlie determined to\nestablish a battery.\n\nNews had arrived that the rajah's brother had raised a force of three\nthousand men; and that, with seven thousand Mahrattas, he was about to\nmarch. This force, Charlie felt certain that he could meet and defeat,\nin the open. But more disquieting news was that Bussy, hearing that\nthe rajah's troops had been trained by an Englishman, had advised the\nnizam to declare for his rival, and to send a considerable force to\nhis assistance, if necessary. Fresh messengers were sent off, with new\nassurances of the rajah's loyalty to the nizam.\n\n\"It may not do much good,\" Charlie said, \"but if we can induce him to\nremain quiet, until we have defeated Murari Reo, it will be so much\ngained.\"\n\nCharlie himself despatched a messenger to Mr. Saunders, begging that\nassistance might be sent to the rajah.\n\nHaving decided upon the position for a battery, energetic steps were\ntaken to form it. A space large enough for the construction of the\nbattery, and for the tents and stores of the artillerymen and two\nhundred infantry, was marked out; and the rajah ordered the whole\npopulation of Ambur, men, women, and children, to assist at the work.\nThe troops, too, were all employed; and under Charlie's\nsuperintendence, a wondrous change was soon effected. The spot chosen\nwas levelled, a strong earthwork was erected round it, and then the\nsurrounding ground was removed. This was a work of immense labour, the\nground consisting first of a layer of soil, then of debris which had\nfallen from the face of the rock above, stones and boulders, to the\ndepth of some fifteen feet, under which was the solid earth.\n\nThe slope resembled an anthill. The soldiers and able-bodied men broke\nup the boulders and rock with sledgehammers; or, when necessary, with\npowder, and blasted the rock, when needed. The women and children\ncarried away the fragments in baskets. The work lasted for a\nfortnight, at the end of which a position of an almost impregnable\nnature was formed. At the foot of the earthworks protecting the guns,\nboth at the face and sides, the ground, composed of great boulders and\nstones, sloped steeply out, forming a bank fifteen feet deep. At its\nfoot, again, the solid rock was blasted away, so as to form a deep\nchasm, thirty feet wide and ten feet high, round the foot of the fort.\nFor a hundred yards on each side, the earth and stones had been\nentirely removed down to the solid rock.\n\nTen guns were placed in the battery, and the fire of these swept the\nslopes behind the town and castle, rendering it impossible, until the\nfort was carried, for an enemy to attack the town on that side; or to\noperate, in any way, against the only point at which an attack could\nbe made upon the castle.\n\nThe rajah was delighted at this most formidable accession to the\ndefensive power of his fortress, which was now in a position to defy\nany attack which could be made against it. A store of provisions and\nammunition was collected there, and the command given to one of\nCharlie's Sepoy lieutenants, with a hundred trained artillerymen, and\ntwo hundred infantry. Numbers of cattle had been driven into the town\nand castle, and stores of provisions collected.\n\nIt was but two days after the battery was complete that the news\narrived that the rajah's brother, with Murari Reo, had entered the\nrajah's dominions, and was marching up the valley to the assault. The\nrajah had, in the first place, wished to defend a strong gorge through\nwhich the enemy would have to pass; this having hitherto been\nconsidered the defensible point of his capital, against an invasion.\nCharlie pointed out, however, that although no doubt a successful\ndefence might be made here, it would only be a repulse, which would\nleave the enemy but little weakened for further operations. He argued\nthat it was better to allow them to advance to the point where the\nvalley opened out into a plain, some two miles wide. He had no doubt\nwhatever that the rajah's troops would be able to inflict a crushing\ndefeat upon the invaders, who would be so disheartened, thereby, that\nthey would be little likely to renew the attack.\n\nTwo bodies of troops, each three hundred strong, were sent down to the\ngorge, with orders to remain in hiding among the heights, to allow the\ninvading army to pass unmolested, and then to inflict the greatest\npossible loss upon them, as they returned. These were under the\ncommand of another of Charlie's lieutenants, who received orders from\nhim to erect breastworks of rock on the slopes above the entrance to\nthe gorge, after the enemy had passed on; and to line these with a\nportion of his men, who should pour a heavy fire into the enemy as\nthey came down the valley; while the rest were to line the heights\nabove the gorge, and to roll down rocks upon those who passed through\nthe fire of their comrades.\n\nThe uniforms were served out to the soldiers, and Charlie surveyed,\nwith pride, the five battalions of trained troops which, with twelve\nguns, marched down into the valley and took up their post beyond it,\nat a point which he had carefully chosen, where the guns of the castle\nwould be able to play upon an advancing body of troops. A body of\ntrained artillerymen were told off for this service, and the\nlast-raised levies were posted in the castle and on the walls of the\ntown.\n\nThe position was so chosen that the flanks of the line rested on the\nslopes on either side. These were broken by inclosures and gardens;\ninto which, on either side, half a battalion was thrown forward, so as\nto deliver a flanking fire upon an enemy advancing against the centre.\nAcross the valley, two hundred yards in front of the position, the\nstream which watered it made a sharp turn, running for some distance\ndirectly across it, and several small canals for the irrigation of the\nfields rendered the ground wet and swampy. Across the line occupied by\nhis troops, a breastwork had been thrown up, and in front of this rows\nof sharp-pointed stakes had been stuck in the ground. Altogether, the\nposition was a formidable one.\n\nAn hour or two after the position so carefully prepared had been taken\nup, large bodies of Mahratta horse were seen dashing up the valley,\nand smoke rising from several points showed that they had begun their\nusual work, of plundering and destroying the villages on their way. A\nfew discharges from the field pieces--those in the castle had been\nordered to be silent until the raising of a white flag gave them the\nsignal to open fire--checked the advance of the horsemen, and these\nwaited until their infantry should arrive.\n\nThe force of Murari Reo was, at that time, the most formidable of any\npurely native army of Southern India. Recruited from desperadoes from\nall the Mahratta tribes, well disciplined by its leader, it had more\nthan once fought, without defeat, against bodies of Europeans; while\nit had, in all cases, obtained easy victories over other native\narmies.\n\nPresently the horsemen opened, and a compact body of three thousand\nMahratta infantry, accompanied by an equal number of the irregulars of\nthe rajah's brother, advanced to the attack; while the cavalry at\ntheir sides swept down upon the flanks of the rajah's position, and\nthirty pieces of artillery opened fire.\n\nNot a shot was fired in return, Charlie ordering his men to lie down\nbehind the breastworks, until they received the word of command to\nshow themselves. The Mahratta horsemen, compelled by the bends of the\nstream to keep near the foot of the slopes, came forward in gallant\nstyle; until suddenly, from every wall and every clump of bushes on\nthe slopes above them, a tremendous fire of musketry broke out, while\nthe twelve field guns, six of which were posted on either side of\nCharlie's centre, poured a destructive fire into them. So deadly was\nthe rain of iron and lead that the Mahratta horsemen instantly drew\nbridle and, leaving the ground strewn with their dead, galloped back.\n\nBy this time the infantry, covered by the fire of their artillery, had\nreached the stream. This was waist deep, and the banks were some two\nfeet above its level. As they scrambled up after crossing it, from the\nline of embankment in front of them a tremendous fire was opened.\nAlthough mowed down in scores, the seasoned warriors of the Mahratta\nchief, cheered on by his voice as, recklessly exposing himself, he\nrode among them, pressed forward. Ever increasing numbers gained a\nfooting across the stream, those in front keeping up a heavy fire at\nthe breastwork, whose face was ploughed by their cannon shot.\n\nAs they advanced the guns of the castle opened fire, not upon those in\nfront, for these were too near the line of entrenchment, but upon the\nstruggling mass still crossing the stream, into which a ceaseless fire\nof musketry was poured from the slopes on their flanks. Still the\nMahratta infantry struggled bravely on, until within a few yards of\nthe entrenchments. Then, suddenly, with a mighty shout, the rajah's\ntroops leaped to their feet, poured a volley from the crest of the\nbreastwork into the enemy; and then, with fixed bayonets, flung\nthemselves upon them.\n\nThe effect was decisive. The Mahrattas had, at the commencement of the\nfight, scarcely outnumbered the troops of the rajah in front of them,\nand had derived but little assistance from the levies of their ally;\nwho, indeed, had contented themselves with keeping up a fire upon the\ndefenders of the slopes. They had already suffered very severely, and\nthe charge made upon them, along the whole line, was irresistible.\n\nBefore the bayonets crossed they broke and fled, hotly pursued by the\ntroops of the rajah. These, in accordance with Charlie's orders, did\nnot scatter, but kept in a close line, four deep, which advanced,\npouring tremendous volleys into their foe.\n\nIn vain did Murari Reo endeavour to rally his men. His infantry, all\norder lost, fled at the top of their speed, their flight covered by\ntheir cavalry, who sacrificed themselves in two or three brilliant\ncharges, right up to the line of pursuers, although suffering terribly\nfrom the withering volleys poured into their ranks.\n\nThe troops were now formed into heavy columns, and these rapidly\nmarched down the valley, after their flying enemy. An hour later, the\nsound of heavy firing was heard in front, and at redoubled speed the\ntroops pressed onward. When they arrived, however, at the gorge, they\nfound that the last of the fugitives had passed through. The ground in\nfront was strewn with dead and dying, for as the mass of fugitives had\narrived at the gorge, the infantry from above had opened fire upon\nthem. Several times the frightened throng had recoiled, but at last,\nimpelled by the greater fear of their pursuers behind, they had dashed\nforward through the fire, only to fall in hundreds in the gorge,\ncrushed beneath the rain of rocks showered down upon them from above.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. The Siege Of Ambur.\n\n\nThe victory was a complete and decisive one. A thousand of the best\ntroops of Murari Reo had fallen, besides some hundreds of their\nirregular allies, whose loss was incurred almost wholly at the gorge\nin the retreat. The rajah was in the highest state of delight at the\nsplendid result, obtained by the European training of his troops; and\nthese, proud of their victory over such formidable opponents, were\nfull of enthusiasm for their young English leader. The rejoicings in\nAmbur that night were great, and all felt confident that the danger\nwas at an end.\n\n\"What think you,\" the rajah said to Charlie, as, the long feast at an\nend, they sat together in the divan, smoking their narghileys, \"will\nbe the result, when the news of the defeat of Murari Reo reaches\nHyderabad?\"\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" Charlie replied. \"It is possible, of course,\nthat it may be considered that it is better to leave you in peace;\nbut, upon the other hand, it may be that they will consider that you\nare so formidable a power, that it is absolutely necessary to crush\nyou at once, rather than to give you the chance of joining against\nthem, in the war which must sooner or later take place between them\nand the English. In that case, it will be a very different affair from\nthat which we have had today.\n\n\"Still, I should send off a messenger tomorrow, to acquaint the nizam\nwith the defeat you inflicted upon the Mahrattas who have invaded you,\nto assure him again of your loyalty, and to beg him to lay his\nauthority upon Murari Reo, not to renew the attack.\"\n\nTen days later a messenger arrived from the nizam, ordering the rajah\nto repair, at once, to Hyderabad, to explain his conduct. The latter\nsent back a message of humble excuses, saying that his health was so\ninjured, by the excitement of recent events, that he was unable to\ntravel; but that, when he recovered, he would journey to Hyderabad to\nlay his respects at the feet of the nizam.\n\nTwo or three days later a messenger arrived from Mr. Saunders, with a\nletter to Charlie. In this he expressed his great satisfaction at the\ndefeat Murari Reo had received; a defeat which would, for some time,\nkeep him quiet, and so relieve the strain upon the English. Affairs\nhad, he said, since the departure of Clive for England, been going\nbadly. Dupleix had received large reinforcements, and the English had\nsuffered several reverses. Mr. Saunders begged him to assure the rajah\nof the respect and friendship of England, and to give him the promise\nthat, if he should be driven from his capital, he would be received\nwith all honor at Madras, and should be reinstated in his dominions,\nwith much added territory, when the English were again in a position\nto take the field in force, and to settle their long feud with the\nFrench.\n\nTen days later, they heard that the army of the nizam, of fifteen\nthousand troops, with eight hundred French under Bussy, were marching\nagainst them; and that the horsemen of Murari Reo were devastating the\nvillages near the frontier. A council of war was held. Charlie would\nfain have fought in the open again, believing that his trained troops,\nflushed with their recent victory, would be a match even for the army\nof the nizam. But the rajah and the rest of the council, alarmed at\nthe presence of the French troops, who had hitherto proved invincible\nagainst vastly superior forces of natives, shrank from such a course;\nand it was decided that they should content themselves with the\ndefence of the town and castle.\n\nOrders were accordingly issued that the old men, the women, and\nchildren should at once leave the town; and, under guard of one\nbattalion of troops, take refuge in an almost impregnable hill fort\nsome miles away. One battalion was placed in garrison in the castle.\nThe other three, with the irregulars, took post in the town, whence\nthey could, if necessary, retreat into the castle.\n\nThe day following the removal of the noncombatants the enemy appeared,\ncoming down the valley, having marched over the hills; while the\nMahratta cavalry again poured up from below.\n\nCharlie had taken the command of the town, as it was against this that\nthe efforts of the enemy would be first directed. It was an imposing\nsight, as the army of the nizam wound down the valley; the great\nmasses of men with their gay flags, the elephants with the gold\nembroidery of their trappings glistening in the sun, the bands of\nhorsemen careering here and there, the lines of artillery drawn by\nbullocks; and, less picturesque but far more menacing, the dark body\nof French infantry, who formed the nucleus and heart of the whole. The\ncamp was pitched just out of range of the guns of the fort, and soon\nline after line of tents, gay with the flags that floated above them,\nrose across the valley.\n\nCharlie had mounted to the castle, the better to observe the movements\nof the enemy, and he presently saw a small body of horsemen ride out\nof the camp, and mount the hillside across the valley. A glass showed\nthat some of these were native officers, while others were in the dark\nuniform of the French.\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" Charlie said to the rajah, \"that is the nizam\nhimself, with Bussy, gone up to reconnoitre the position. I wonder how\nhe likes the look of it. I wish we could have turfed the battery\nabove, and the newly stripped land. We might, in that case, have given\nthem a pleasant surprise. As it is, they are hardly likely to begin by\nan attack along the slopes in the rear of the town, and you will see\nthat they will commence the attack at the farther face of the town.\nThe battery above cannot aid us in our defence there; and although the\ncastle may help, it will only be by a direct fire. If they try to\ncarry the place by a coup de main, I think we can beat them off, but\nthey must succeed by regular approaches.\n\n\"We must inflict as much loss as we can, and then fall back. However,\nit will be sometime before that comes.\"\n\nThe next morning, Charlie found that the enemy had, during the night,\nerected three batteries on the slopes facing the north wall of the\ntown, that farthest removed from the castle. They at once opened fire,\nand the guns on the walls facing them replied, while those on the\ncastle hurled their shot over the town into the enemy's battery. For\nthree days, the artillery fire was kept up without intermission. The\nguns on the wall were too weak to silence the batteries of the\nbesiegers, although these were much annoyed by the fire from the fort,\nwhich dismounted four of their guns, and blew up one of their\nmagazines. Several times the town was set on fire by the shell from\nthe French mortars; but Charlie had organized the irregulars into\nbands with buckets, and these succeeded in extinguishing the flames\nbefore they spread.\n\nSeeing that the mud wall of the town was crumbling rapidly before the\nbesiegers' fire, Charlie set his troops to work, and levelled every\nhouse within fifty yards of it, and with the stones and beams formed\nbarricades across the end of the streets beyond. Many of the guns from\nother portions of the walls were removed, and placed on these\nbarricades. The ends of the houses were loopholed, and all was\nprepared for a desperate defence.\n\nCharlie's experience at Arcot stood him in good stead, and he imitated\nthe measures taken by Clive at that place. When these defences were\ncompleted, he raised a second line of barricades some distance further\nback; and here, when the assault was expected, he placed one of his\nbattalions, with orders that, if the inner line of entrenchments was\ncarried, they should allow all the defenders of that post to pass\nthrough, and then resist until the town was completely evacuated, when\nthey were to fall back upon the fort. He had, however, little fear\nthat his position would be taken at the first assault.\n\nUpon the evening of the third day, the besiegers' fire had done its\nwork, and a gap in the wall some eighty yards wide was formed. The\ngarrison were ordered to hold themselves in readiness, and a strict\nwatch was set.\n\nTowards morning, a distant hum in the nizam's camp proclaimed that the\ntroops were mustering for the assault. The besiegers' guns had\ncontinued their fire all night, to prevent working parties from\nplacing obstacles in the breach. As the first shades of daylight\nappeared the fire ceased, and a great column of men poured forward to\nthe assault.\n\nThe few remaining guns upon the end wall opened upon them, as did the\ninfantry who lined the parapet, while the guns in the castle at once\njoined in. The mighty column, however, composed of the troops of the\nnizam, pressed forward, poured over the fragments of the wall, and\nentered the clear space behind it.\n\nThen, from housetop and loophole, and from the walls on either side, a\nconcentrated fire of musketry was poured upon them, while twelve guns,\nfour on each barricade, swept them with grape. The head of the column\nwithered away under the fire, long lines were swept through the\ncrowded mass; and, after a minute or two's wild firing at their\nconcealed foes, the troops of the nizam, appalled and shattered by the\ntremendous fire, broke and fled.\n\nThe instant they had cleared the breach, the guns of the besiegers\nagain opened furiously upon it, to check any sortie which the besieged\nmight attempt.\n\nAn hour later, the besiegers hoisted a white flag, and requested to be\nallowed to bury their dead, and remove their wounded. This Charlie\nagreed to, with the proviso that these should be carried by his own\nmen beyond the breach, as he did not wish that the enemy should have\nan opportunity of examining the internal defences. The task occupied\nsome time, as more than five hundred dead and dying lay scattered in\nthe open space.\n\nDuring the rest of the day, the enemy showed no signs of resuming the\nassault. During the night they could be heard hard at work, and\nalthough a brisk fire was kept up to hinder them, Charlie found that\nthey had pushed trenches, from the batteries, a considerable distance\nround each corner of the town.\n\nFor four days the besiegers worked vigorously, harassed as they were\nby the guns of the fort, and by those of the battery high up on the\nhillside, which were now able to take in flank the works across the\nupper angle of the town. At the end of that time, they had erected and\narmed two batteries, which at daylight opened upon the walls which\nformed the flanks of the clear space behind the breach. Although\nsuffering heavily from the fire of the besieged, and losing many men,\nthese batteries kept up their fire unceasingly, night and day, until\ngreat gaps had been made in the walls, and Charlie was obliged to\nwithdraw his troops from them, behind the line of barricades.\n\nDuring this time the fire of the batteries in front had been\nunceasing, and had destroyed most of the houses which formed the\nconnecting line between the barricades. Each night, however, the\nbesieged worked to repair damages, and to fill up the gaps thus formed\nwith piles of stones and beams, so that, by the end of the fourth day\nafter the repulse of the first assault, a line of barricades stretched\nacross the line of defence.\n\nThe enemy, this time, prepared to attack by daylight, and early in the\nmorning the whole army of the nizam marched to the assault. Heedless\nof the fire of the castle, they formed up in a long line of heavy\nmasses, along the slope. One huge column moved forward against the\nmain breach, two advanced obliquely towards the great gaps in the\nwalls on either side. The latter columns were each headed by bodies of\nFrench troops.\n\nIn vain the guns of the fort, aided by those of the battery on the\nhill, swept them. The columns advanced without a check until they\nentered the breaches. Then a line of fire swept along the crest of the\nbarricade from end to end, and the cannon of the besieged roared out.\nPressed by the mass from behind, the columns advanced, torn and rent\nby the fire, and at last gained the foot of the barricade.\n\nHere, those in front strove desperately to climb up the great mound of\nrubbish, while those behind covered them with a storm of bullets aimed\nat its summit. More than once the troops of the rajah, rushing down\nthe embankment, drove back the struggling masses, but so heavily did\nthey suffer from the fire, when they thus exposed themselves, that\nCharlie forbade them to repeat the attempt. He knew that there was\nsafety behind, and was unwilling that his brave fellows should throw\naway their lives.\n\nIn the centre of the position the native troops, although they several\ntimes climbed some distance up the barricade, were yet unable to make\nway. But the French troops at the flanks were steadily forcing their\nway up. Many had climbed up by the ruins of the wall, and from its top\nwere firing down on the defenders of the barricade. Inch by inch they\nwon their way up the barricade, already thickly covered with dead; and\nthen Charlie, seeing that his men were beginning to waver, gave the\nsignal.\n\nThe long blast of a trumpet was heard even above the tremendous din.\nIn an instant the barricades were deserted, and the defenders rushed\ninto the houses. The partition walls between these on the lower floors\nhad already been knocked down, and without suffering from the heavy\nfire which the assailants opened, as soon as they gained the crest of\nthe barricade, the defenders retreated along these covered ways until\nin rear of the second line of defence.\n\nThis was held by the battalion placed there, until the whole of the\ndefenders of the town had left it, by the gate leading up to the fort.\nThen Charlie withdrew this battalion also, and the town remained in\nthe hands of the enemy; who had lost, Charlie reckoned, fully fifteen\nhundred men in the assault.\n\nDuring the fight Tim and the faithful Hossein, now fully recovered and\npromoted to the rank of an officer, had remained close beside him; and\nwere, with him, the last to leave the town.\n\nThe instant the evacuation was complete, the guns of the hill battery\nopened upon the town; and a tremendous fire of musketry was poured\nupon it from every point of the castle which commanded it; while the\nguns, which from their lofty elevation, could not be depressed\nsufficiently to bear upon the town, directed their fire upon the\nbodies of troops still beyond the walls. The enemy had captured the\ntown, indeed, but its possession aided them but little in their\nassault upon the fort. The only advantage it gave them, would have\nbeen that it would have enabled them to attack the lower gate of the\nfort, protected by its outer wall from the fire of the hill battery.\nCharlie had, however, perceived that this would be the case, and had\nplanted a number of mines under the wall at this point. These were\nexploded when the defenders of the town entered the fort, and a\nhundred yards of the wall were thus destroyed; leaving the space,\nacross which the enemy must advance to the attack of the gate, exposed\nto the fire of the hill battery, as well as of the numerous guns of\nthe fort bearing upon it.\n\nTwo days passed without any further operations on the part of the\nenemy; and then Bussy, seeing that nothing whatever could be done\ntowards assaulting the fortress, so long as the battery remained in\nthe hands of the besieged, determined to make a desperate effort to\ncarry it, ignorant of its immense strength. At night, therefore, he\nordered two bodies of men, each fifteen hundred strong, to mount the\nhillside, far to the right and left of the town; to move along at the\nfoot of the wall of rock, and to carry the battery by storm at\ndaybreak.\n\nCharlie, believing that such an attempt would be made, had upon the\nday following the fall of the town taken his post there, and had\nordered a most vigilant watch to be kept up, each night; placing\nsentries some hundred yards away, on either side, to give warning of\nthe approach of an enemy.\n\nTowards daybreak on the third morning a shot upon the left, followed a\nfew seconds later by one on the right, told that the enemy were\napproaching. A minute or two afterwards the sentries ran in, climbed\nfrom the ditch by ladders which had been placed there for the purpose,\nand, hauling these up after them, were soon in the battery, with the\nnews that large bodies of the enemy were approaching on either flank.\nScarcely were the garrison at their posts, when the French were seen\napproaching. At once they broke into a run, and, gallantly led, dashed\nacross the space of cleared rock, in spite of the heavy fire of\nmusketry and grape.\n\nWhen they came, however, to the edge of the deep gulf in the solid\nrock, they paused. They had had no idea of meeting with such an\nobstacle as this. It was easy enough to leap down, but impossible to\nclimb up the steep face, ten feet high, in front of them; and which,\nin the dim light, could be plainly seen. It was, however, impossible\nfor those in front to pause. Pressed upon by those behind, who did not\nknow what was stopping them, large numbers were compelled to jump into\nthe trench, where they found themselves unable either to advance or\nretreat.\n\nBy this time, every gun on the upper side of the castle had opened on\nthe assailing columns, taking them in flank, while the fire of the\nbattery was continued without a moment's intermission. Bussy himself,\nwho was commanding one of the columns, pushed his way through his\nstruggling soldiers to the edge of the trench; when, seeing the\nimpossibility of scaling the sides, unprovided as he was with scaling\nladders, he gave the orders to retreat; and the columns, harassed by\nthe flanking fire of the guns of the castle, and pursued by that of\nthe battery, retreated, having lost some hundreds of their number;\nbesides a hundred and fifty of their best men, prisoners in the deep\ntrench around the battery.\n\nThese were summoned to surrender; and, resistance being impossible,\nthey at once laid down their arms. Ladders were lowered to them, and\nthey were marched as prisoners to the fort.\n\nThe next morning, when the defenders of the fortress looked over the\nvalley, the great camp was gone. The nizam and Bussy, despairing of\nthe possibility of carrying the position, at once so enormously strong\nby nature, and so gallantly defended, had raised the siege; which had\ncost them over two thousand of their best soldiers, including two\nhundred French killed and prisoners, and retreated to the plateau of\nthe Deccan.\n\nThe exultation of the rajah and his troops was unbounded. They felt\nthat, now and henceforth, they were safe from another invasion; and\nthe rajah saw that, in the future, he should be able to gain greatly\nincreased territory, as the ally of the English. His gratitude to\nCharlie was unbounded, and he literally loaded him with costly\npresents.\n\nThree weeks later, a letter was received by the latter from Mr.\nSaunders, congratulating him upon the inestimable service which he had\nrendered, and appointing him to the rank of captain in the Company's\nservice. Now that the rajah would be able to protect himself, should\nany future assault be made upon him--an event most unlikely to happen,\nas Bussy and the nizam would be unwilling to risk a repetition of a\ndefeat, which had already so greatly injured their prestige--he had\nbetter return to Madras, where, as Mr. Saunders said, the services of\nso capable an officer were greatly needed. He warned him, however, to\nbe careful in the extreme how he made his way back, as the country was\nin a most disturbed state, the Mahratta bands being everywhere out\nplundering and burning.\n\nSubsequent information, that the Mahrattas were swarming in the plains\nbelow, determined Charlie to accept an offer which the rajah made him;\nthat he should, under a strong escort, cross the mountains, and make\nhis way to a port on the west coast, in the state of a friendly rajah,\nwhere he would be able to take ship and coast round to Madras. The\nrajah promised to send Charlie's horses and other presents down to\nMadras, when an opportunity should offer; and Charlie, accompanied by\nthe four Sepoys, all of whom had been promoted to the rank of\nofficers; by Tim Kelly and Hossein, who would not separate himself a\nmoment from his side, started from Ambur, with an escort of thirty\nhorsemen.\n\nThe rajah was quite affected at the parting; and the army, which he\nhad formed and organized, paraded before him for the last time, and\nthen shouted their farewell.\n\nCharlie himself, although glad to return among his countrymen, from\nwhom he had been nearly two years separated, was yet sorry to leave\nthe many friends he had made. His position was now a very different\none from that which he held when he left Madras. Then he was a newly\nmade lieutenant, who had distinguished himself, indeed, under Clive,\nbut who was as yet unknown save to his commander, and who was as poor\nas when he had landed, eighteen months before, in India. Now he had\ngained a name for himself, and his successful defence of Ambur had\nbeen of immense service to the Company. He was, too, a wealthy man;\nfor the presents in money, alone, of the rajah, had amounted to over\ntwenty-five thousand pounds; a sum which, in these days, may appear\nextraordinary, but which was small to that frequently bestowed, by\nwealthy native princes, upon British officers who had done them a good\nservice. Clive himself, after his short campaign, had returned to\nEngland with a far larger sum.\n\nFor several days, the party rode through the hills without incident;\nand on the fifth day they saw, stretched at their feet, a rich flat\ncountry dotted with villages, beyond which extended the long blue line\nof the sea. The distance was greater than Charlie imagined, and 'twas\nonly after two days' long ride that he reached Calicut, where he was\nreceived with great honor by the rajah, to whom the leader of the\nescort brought letters of introduction from the Rajah of Ambur.\n\nFor four days Charlie remained as his guest, and then took a passage\nin a large native vessel, bound for Ceylon, whence he would have no\ndifficulty in obtaining passage to Madras.\n\nThese native ships are very high out of water, rising considerably\ntowards the stem and stern, and in form they somewhat resemble the\nChinese junk; but are without the superabundance of grotesque\npainting, carving, and gilding which distinguish the latter. The rajah\naccompanied Charlie to the shore, and a salute was fired, by his\nfollowers, in honor of the departure of the guest.\n\nThe weather was lovely, and the clumsy craft, with all sail set, was\nsoon running down the coast. When they had sailed some hours from\nCalicut, from behind a headland, four vessels suddenly made their\nappearance. They were lower in the water, and much less clumsy in\nappearance than the ordinary native craft, and were propelled not only\nby their sails, but by a number of oars on each side.\n\nNo sooner did the captain and crew of the ship behold these vessels,\nthan they raised a cry of terror and despair. The captain, who was\npart owner of the craft, ran up and down the deck like one possessed,\nand the sailors seemed scarcely less terrified.\n\n\"What on earth is the matter?\" Charlie exclaimed. \"What vessels are\nthose, and why are you afraid of them?\"\n\n\"Tulagi Angria! Tulagi Angria!\" the captain cried, and the crew took\nup the refrain.\n\nThe name that they uttered fully accounted for their terror.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. The Pirates' Hold.\n\n\nSivagi, the founder of the Mahratta Empire, had, in 1662, seized and\nfortified Yijiyadrug; or, as the English call it, Gheriah, a town at\nthe mouth of the river Kanui, one hundred and seventy miles south of\nBombay; and also the island of Suwarndrug, about half way between\nGheriah and Bombay. Here he established a piratical fleet. Fifty years\nlater, Kanhagi Angria, the commander of the Mahratta fleet, broke off\nthis connection with the successors of Sivagi, and set up as a pirate\non his own account. Kanhagi not only plundered the native vessels, but\nboldly preyed upon the commerce of the European settlements. The ships\nof the East India Company, the French Company, and the Dutch were\nfrequently captured by these pirates.\n\nTulagi Angria, who succeeded his father, was even bolder and more\nsuccessful; and when the man-of-war brig, the Restoration, with twenty\nguns and two hundred men, was fitted out to attack him, he defeated\nand captured her. After this, he attacked and captured the French\nman-of-war Jupitre, with forty guns; and had even the insolence to\nassail an English convoy guarded by two men-of-war; the Vigilant, of\nsixty-four guns, and the Ruby, of fifty.\n\nThe Dutch, in 1735, sent a fleet of seven ships of war, two bomb\nvessels, and a strong body of troops against Gheriah. The attack was,\nhowever, repulsed with considerable loss. From that date the pirates\ngrew bolder and bolder, and were a perfect scourge to the commerce of\nWestern India.\n\nCharlie Marryat had, of course, frequently heard of the doings of\nthese noted pirates, and the cry of \"Tulagi Angria\" at once explained\nto him the terror of the master and crew.\n\n\"What is it, Mr. Charles, what on earth is the botheration about? Is\nit the little ships they're afeared of?\"\n\n\"Those ships belong to a pirate called Tulagi Angria,\" Charlie said,\n\"and I am very much afraid, Tim, that we are likely to see the inside\nof his fortress.\"\n\n\"But shure, yer honor, we're not afeared of those four little boats.\"\n\n\"We are, Tim, and very much afraid, too. Each of those boats, as you\ncall them, carries four or five times as many men as this ship. They\nare well armed, while we have only those two little guns, which are\nuseless except for show. If the crew were Englishmen, we might attempt\na defence, although even then the odds would be terribly against us;\nbut with these natives, it is hopeless to think of it, and the attempt\nwould only ensure our throats being cut.\"\n\nIt was clear that the idea of resistance did never even enter the\nminds of the crew of the trader. Some ran to and fro, with\ngesticulations and cries of despair. Some threw themselves upon the\ndeck of the vessel, tore their hair, and rolled as if in convulsions.\nSome sat down quietly, with the air of apathetic resignation, with\nwhich the natives of India are used to meet what they consider the\ninevitable.\n\nHossein, who, at the first alarm, had bounded to his feet with his\nhand on his knife, subsided into an attitude of indifference, when he\nsaw that Charlie did not intend making any defence.\n\n\"It's mighty lucky,\" Tim said, \"that yer honor left all your presents\nto be forwarded to Madras. I thought you were wrong, Mr. Charles, when\nyou advised me to send them thousand rupees the rajah gave me, along\nwith your money. A hundred pounds wasn't a sum that Tim Kelly was\nlikely to handle again in a hurry, and it went agin the grain with me,\nto part with them out of my hands. Sure and it's well I took yer\nhonor's advice.\"\n\nThe four Sepoy officers also exchanged a few words with Charlie. They,\ntoo, would have resisted, had he given the word, hopeless though the\neffort would have been. But they acquiesced, at once, in his decision.\nThey had little to lose; but the thought of a prolonged captivity, and\nof being obliged, perhaps, to enter the service of the Mahratta\nfreebooters, just when about to return to their wives and families at\nMadras, was a terrible blow to them.\n\n\"Keep up your spirits,\" Charlie said. \"It is a bad business, but we\nmust hope for the best. If we bide our time, we may see some chance of\nescape. You had better lay down your arms in a pile, here. Then we\nwill sit down quietly, and await their coming on board. They will be\nhere in a minute, now.\"\n\nScarcely had the seven passengers taken their seats in a group, on the\npoop, when the freebooters ranged alongside, and swarmed over the\nsides onto the deck. Beyond bestowing a few kicks upon the crew, they\npaid no attention whatever to them; but tore off the hatches, and at\nonce proceeded to investigate the contents of the hold. The greater\nportion of this consisted of native grains, but there were several\nbales of merchandise, consigned by traders at Calicut for Ceylon. The\ncargo was, in fact, rather more valuable than that generally found in\na native coaster, and the pirates were satisfied.\n\nThe leader of the party, leaving to his followers the task of\nexamining the hold, walked towards the group on the poop. They rose at\nhis approach.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the Mahratta asked.\n\n\"I am an officer in the English Company's service,\" Charlie said, \"as\nare these five natives. The other Englishman is a soldier, under my\norders.\"\n\n\"Good,\" the Mahratta said, emphatically. \"Tulagi Angria will be glad\nto have you. When your people capture any of our men, which is not\noften, they hang them. Tulagi is glad to have people he can hang,\ntoo.\"\n\nAfter being stripped of any small valuables on their persons, the\ncaptives were taken on board one of the pirate boats. A score of the\nMahrattas remained in charge of the trader. Her head was turned north,\nand, accompanied by the four Mahratta boats, she proceeded up the\ncoast again. Another trader was captured on the way, but two others\nevaded the pirates, by running into the port of Calicut.\n\nThe trader was a slow sailer, and they were eight days before they\napproached Gheriah. Early in the morning a heavy cannonade was heard\nin the distance, causing the greatest excitement among the Mahrattas.\nEvery sail was hoisted, the sweeps got out and, leaving the trader to\njog along in their rear, the four light craft made their way rapidly\nalong the coast. The firing became heavier and heavier, and as it\nbecame light, three large ships could be seen, about two miles ahead,\nsurrounded by a host of smaller craft.\n\n\"That's a big fight, Mr. Charles,\" Tim exclaimed. \"It reminds me of\nthree big bulls in a meadow, attacked by a host of little curs.\"\n\n\"It does, Tim; but the curs can bite. What a fire they are keeping up.\nBut those warships ought to thrash any number of them. Count the\nports, I can see them now.\"\n\n\"The biggest one,\" Tim said, \"has got twenty-five.\"\n\n\"Yes; and the others eighteen and nine. They are two frigates, one of\nfifty and the other of thirty-six guns; and a sloop of eighteen. I\ncan't make out the colours, but I don't think they're English.\"\n\n\"They're not English, yer honor,\" Tim said confidently, \"or they would\nsoon make an end of them varmint that's tormenting them.\"\n\nThe scene, as the boats approached, was very exciting. The three ships\nwere pouring their broadsides, without intermission, into the pirate\nfleet. This consisted of vessels of all sizes, from the Jupitre and\nRestoration, down to large rowing galleys. Although many were sunk,\nand more greatly damaged by the fire of the Dutch, they swarmed round\nthe great ships with wonderful tenacity; and, while the larger vessels\nfought their guns against those of the men-of-war, the smaller ones\nkept close to them, avoiding as much as possible their formidable\nbroadsides, but keeping up a perpetual musketry fire at their bulwarks\nand tops, throwing stink pots, and shooting burning arrows through the\nports; and getting alongside under the muzzles of the guns, and trying\nto climb up into the ports.\n\nThe four newly arrived craft joined in the fray.\n\n\"This is mighty unpleasant, yer honor,\" Tim said, as a shot from one\nof the Dutch men-of-war struck the craft they were in, crashing a hole\nthrough her bulwarks, and laying five or six of her crew upon the\ndeck, killed or wounded by the splinters. \"Here we are, in the middle\nof a fight in which we've no consarn whatever, and which is carried on\nwithout asking our will or pleasure; and we are as likely to be killed\nby a Christian shot, as these hathen niggers.\n\n\"Hear them yell, yer honor. A faction fight's nothing to it. Look, yer\nhonor, look! There's smoke curling up from a hatchway of the big ship.\nIf they haven't set her afire!\"\n\nIt was as Tim said. A cloud of black smoke was rising from the Dutch\nfifty-gun frigate. A wild yell of triumph broke from the Mahrattas.\nThe fire of their guns upon her redoubled, while that from the\nman-of-war died away, as the crew were called off to assist in\nextinguishing the flames. Now the smaller boats pressed still more\nclosely round her, and a rain of missiles was poured through the open\nports. Several times the Mahrattas climbed on board, but each time\nwere driven out again. The smoke rose thicker and thicker, and tongues\nof flame could be seen shooting up.\n\n\"She is doomed,\" Charlie exclaimed. \"Even if unmolested, the crew\ncould not extinguish the fire, now. It has got too much hold.\n\n\"Ah! The other frigate is on fire now.\"\n\nFresh yells of triumph rose from the Mahrattas. On board the sloop\nevery sail was hoisted, in spite of the continued fire of muskets and\narrows, which killed many of the sailors employed. The Jupitre,\nhowever, ran alongside her and grappled with her, and a furious combat\ncould be seen proceeding on the decks. Meanwhile, the flames mounted\nhigher and higher on board the two frigates. The crew now could be\nseen leaping overboard from the ports, choosing any death rather than\nthat by fire.\n\nIt was but a choice. Many were drowned, the rest cut or shot down by\nthe Mahrattas. Down came the Dutch flag, fluttering from the masthead\nof the sloop, and the wild Mahratta yell proclaimed that the victory\nwas everywhere complete.\n\nThe frigates were now a sheet of flames, and the Mahratta craft drew\naway from them; until, with two tremendous explosions, their magazines\nblew up and they sank beneath the waters.\n\n\"I should scarcely have believed it possible,\" Charlie said, \"that\nthree fine ships of war, mounting a hundred and four guns, could be\ndestroyed by a fleet of pirates, however numerous. Well, Tim, there is\nno doubt that these natives can fight, when well led. It is just as\nwell, you see, that we did not attempt to offer any resistance, in\nthat clumsy craft we were on board.\"\n\n\"You're right there, yer honor. They would have aten us up in five\nminutes. It makes my heart bleed, to think of the sailors of those two\nfine ships. I don't believe that a soul has escaped; but in the small\none, some may have been taken prisoners.\"\n\nWhen the fight was over, the craft in which were the captives ran\nalongside the flagship of the pirate leader, and the captain reported\nto him the capture he had made. Fortunately, Tulagi Angria was in a\nhigh state of delight, at the victory he had just won; and, instead of\nordering them to be instantly executed, he told the captain to take\nthem on to Suwarndrug, and to imprison them there until his arrival.\nHe himself, with the rest of his fleet, and the captured Dutch sloop,\nsailed into Gheriah; and the craft, in which Charlie and his\ncompanions were imprisoned, continued her course to the island\nstronghold of the pirates.\n\nSuwarndrug was built on a rocky island. It lay within gunshot of the\nshore. Here, when Kanhagi Angria had first revolted from the authority\nof the Mahratta kingdom, the ruler of the Deccan had caused three\nstrong forts to be built, in order to reduce the island fort. The\npirates, however, had taken the initiative, and had captured these\nforts; as well as the whole line of seacoast, a hundred and twenty\nmiles in length; and the country behind, twenty or thirty miles broad,\nextending to the foot of the mountains.\n\nOn their arrival at Suwarndrug, the prisoners were handed over to the\ngovernor, and were imprisoned in one of the casemates of the fort. The\nnext day, they were taken out and ordered to work; and, for weeks,\nthey laboured at the fortifications, with which the pirates were\nstrengthening their already naturally strong position. The labour was\nvery severe, but it was a consolation to the captives that they were\nkept together.\n\nBy Charlie's advice they exerted themselves to the utmost, and thus\nsucceeded in pleasing their masters, and in escaping with but a small\nshare of the blows, which were liberally distributed among other\nprisoners, native and European, employed upon the work. Charlie,\nindeed, was appointed as a sort of overseer; having under him not only\nhis own party, but thirty others, of whom twenty were natives, and ten\nEnglish sailors, who had been captured in a merchantman. Although\nclosely watched, he was able to cheer these men, by giving them a hope\nthat a chance of escape from their captivity might shortly arrive. All\nexpressed their readiness to run any risk to regain their liberty.\n\nFrom what he heard the pirates say, Charlie learned that they were\nexpecting an attack from an expedition which was preparing at Bombay.\nThe English sailors were confined in a casemate, adjoining that\noccupied by Charlie and his companions. The guard kept over them was\nbut nominal, as it was considered impossible that they could escape\nfrom the island, off which lay a large fleet of the pirate vessels.\n\nOne morning upon starting to work they perceived, by the stir in the\nfortress, that something unusual was taking place; and presently, on\nreaching the rampart, they saw in the distance a small squadron\napproaching. They could make out that it consisted of a ship of\nforty-four guns, one of sixteen, and two bomb vessels, together with a\nfleet of native craft.\n\nThe pirate fleet were all getting up sail.\n\n\"It's a bold thing, Tim, to attack this fortress with only two ships,\nwhen the pirates have lately beaten a Dutch squadron mounting double\nthe number of guns.\"\n\n\"Ah, yer honor, but then there is the Union Jack floating at the\nmasthead. Do you think the creeturs don't know the differ?\"\n\n\"But the Dutchmen are good sailors, and fought well, Tim. I think the\ndifference is that in the last case they attacked the Dutch, while in\nthe present we are attacking them. It makes all the difference in the\nworld, with Indians. Let them attack you, and they'll fight bravely\nenough. Go right at them, and they're done for.\n\n\"Look, the pirate fleet are already sailing away.\"\n\n\"And do you think the English will take the fort, yer honor?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Tim. The place is tremendously strong, and built on a\nrock. There are guns which bear right down on the ships, if they\nventure in close, while theirs will do but little damage to these\nsolidly built walls. Suwarndrug ought to resist a fleet ten times as\nstrong as that before us.\"\n\n\"Shure then, yer honor, and will we have to remain here all our lives,\ndo ye think?\"\n\n\"No, Tim, I hope not. Besides, I think that we ought to be able to\nrender some assistance to them.\"\n\n\"And how will we do it, yer honor? You have but to spake the word, and\nTim Kelly is ready to go through fire and water; and so is Hossein. Ye\nmay be shure of that.\"\n\nSeeing that the pirates were now mustering round their guns, and that\nthe ships were ranging up for action, Charlie thought it prudent to\nretire. Hitherto no attention had been paid to them, but 'twas\nprobable enough that, when the pirates' blood became heated by the\nfight, they would vent their fury upon their captives. He therefore\nadvised not only the native officers, but the sailors, to retire to\ntheir casemates; which, as the guns placed in them did not command the\nposition taken up by the ships, were at presented untenanted by any of\nthe garrison.\n\nPresently the noise of guns proclaimed that the engagement had begun.\nThe boom of the cannon of the ships was answered by an incessant fire\nfrom the far more numerous artillery of the fortress, while now and\nthen a heavy explosion, close at hand, told of the bursting of the\nbombs from the mortar vessels, in the fortress.\n\nCharlie had been thinking of the best measures to be taken, to aid his\nfriends, ever since the squadron came in sight; and, after sitting\nquietly for half an hour, he called his officers around him.\n\n\"I am convinced,\" he said, \"that if unaided from within, the ships\nwill have no chance whatever of taking this fortress; but I think that\nwe may help them. The upper fort, which contains the magazine,\ncommands the whole of the interior. But its guns do not bear upon the\nships where they are anchored. Probably the place, at present, is\nalmost deserted. As no one pays any attention to us, I propose, with\nTim Kelly and the ten English sailors, to seize it. We can close the\ngate, and discharge the guns upon the defenders of the sea face. We\ncould not, of course, defend it for five minutes if they attacked us;\nbut we would threaten to blow up the magazine, if they did so.\n\n\"I propose that, tomorrow morning, you four and Hossein shall strip to\nyour loincloths, and just before it becomes light go along the walls,\nand stop up, with pieces of wood, the touch holes of as many of the\ncannon as you can. It would not do to use nails, even if we had them.\nNo one will notice, in the dark, that you are not Mahrattas; and if\nyou scatter about, you may each manage to close up four or five guns,\nat least. It is, I know, a desperate service, and if discovered you\nwill be instantly killed. But if it succeeds the pirates, scared by\ndiscovering, just as our ships open fire, that a number of their guns\nare disabled; while we take them in the rear, from the fort behind,\nmay not improbably surrender at once. At any rate, it's worth trying;\nand I, for one, would rather run the risk of being killed, than be\ncondemned to pass my life the slave of these pirates, who may at any\nmoment cut our throats, in case of any reverse happening to them.\"\n\nThe four native officers at once stated their willingness to join in\nthe plan. Hossein did not consider any reply necessary. With him, it\nwas a matter of course to do whatever Charlie suggested.\n\nThe latter then went into the next casemate, and unfolded his plan to\nthe sailors, who heartily agreed to make an effort for their liberty.\n\nThe fire continued all day unabated; and at nightfall, when a man, as\nusual, brought the captives food, he exultingly told them that no\ndamage whatever had been effected by the guns of the fleet.\n\nIn the evening, the party cut a number of pieces of wood; these,\nmeasuring by the cannon in the casemate, they made of just sufficient\nsize and length to push down, with a slight effort, through the touch\nhole. When pushed down to their full length, they touched the interior\nof the cannon below, and were just level with the top of the touch\nhole. Thus, it would be next to impossible to extricate them in a\nhurry. They might, indeed, be broken and forced in by a solid punch,\nof the same size as the touch hole; but this would take time, and\nwould not be likely to occur, on the moment, to the pirates.\n\nThe skewers, for this is what they resembled, were very strong and\ntough; being made of slips of bamboo. The prisoners had all knives,\nwhich they used for cutting their food. With these the work was\naccomplished.\n\nTowards morning the five natives, with the skewers hidden away in\ntheir loincloths, and their turbans twisted in Mahratta fashion, stole\nout from the casemate. Charlie had ordered that, in case they should\nsee that the ships had drawn off from the position they occupied on\nthe preceding day, they should return without attempting to carry out\ntheir task.\n\nHe himself, with Tim, joined the sailors; and, first ascending the\nramparts and seeing that the ships were still at anchor, abreast of\nthe fort, he and his comrades strolled across the interior of the\nfort, in the direction of the magazine. They did not keep together,\nnor did all move directly towards the position which they wished to\ngain.\n\nThe place was already astir. Large numbers of the pirates thronged the\ninterior. Groups were squatted round fires, busy in cooking their\nbreakfasts. Numbers were coming from the magazine, with powder to fill\nup the small magazines on the walls. Others, again, were carrying shot\nfrom the pyramids of missiles, piled up here and there in the\ncourtyard. None paid any attention to the English prisoners.\n\nPresently a dull boom was heard. There was a whistling sound; and with\na thud, followed by a loud explosion, a bomb fell and burst in the\nopen space.\n\nThis was the signal for action. The pirates, in a moment, hurried down\nto the bastions overlooking the sea; and the Englishmen gathered, in a\ngroup, near the entrance to the magazine. Besides their knives they\nhad no arms, but each had picked up two or three heavy stones.\n\nA minute after the explosion of the shell, the cannonade of the ships\nbroke out. It was answered by only a few guns from the fortress, and\nyells of astonishment and rage were heard to arise.\n\nA moment later, five natives ran up to the group of Englishmen. Their\nwork had been well done, and more than three-fourths of the guns on\nthe sea face had been rendered temporarily useless.\n\nCharlie gave the word, and with a rush they entered the upper fort.\nThere were but two or three men there, who were just hurrying out with\ntheir bags of powder. These, before they realized the position, were\ninstantly knocked down and bound. The gate of the fort was then shut\nand barred, and the party ran up to the bastion above.\n\nNot a single pirate was to be seen there. The six guns, which stood\nthere, were at once loaded with grape; and a heavy discharge was\npoured into the crowded masses of pirates, upon the bastions on the\nsea face. These, already greatly disturbed at finding that most of\ntheir guns had, in some way, been rendered useless; were panic\nstricken at this sudden and unexpected attack from the rear. Many of\nthem broke from their guns and fled to shelter, others endeavoured to\nturn their cannon to bear upon the magazine.\n\nThe wildest confusion raged. At last some of their leaders rallied the\nmen; and, with yells of fury, a rush was made towards the magazine.\nThey were received with another discharge of grape, which took\nterrible effect. Many recoiled, but their leaders, shouting to them\nthat the guns were discharged, and there were but a dozen men there,\nled them on again.\n\nCharlie leaped upon the edge of the parapet, and shouted:\n\n\"If you attack us, we will blow up the magazine. I have but to lift my\nhand, and the magazine will be fired.\"\n\nThe boldest of the assailants were paralysed by the threat. Confusion\nreigned throughout the fortress. The fleet kept up their fire with\ngreat vigour; judging, by the feebleness of the reply, that something\nunusual must be happening within the walls. The gunners, disheartened\nby finding their pieces useless, and unable to extract the wooden\nplugs, while Charlie's men continued to ply them with grape, left\ntheir guns and, with the greater portion of the garrison, disorganized\nand panic stricken, retired into shelter.\n\nA shell from the ships, falling on to a thatched building, set it on\nfire. The flames rapidly spread, and soon all the small huts occupied\nby the garrison were in flames. The explosion of a magazine added to\nthe terror of the garrison, and the greater portion of them, with the\nwomen and children, ran down to the water; and, taking boats,\nattempted to cross to Fort Goa, on the mainland. They were, however,\ncut off by the English boats, and captured.\n\nCommodore James, who commanded the squadron, now directed his fire at\nFort Goa; which was being feebly attacked, on the land side, by a\nMahratta force; which had been landed from the Mahratta fleet,\naccompanying the English ships, a few miles down the coast. The fort\nshortly surrendered; but while the Mahrattas were marching to take\npossession, the governor, with some of his best men, took boat and\ncrossed over to the island; of which, although the fire had ceased\nafter the explosion of the magazine, the English had not taken\npossession.\n\nThe fire from its guns again opened, and as Commodore James thought it\nprobable that the pirates would, in the night, endeavour to throw in\nlarge reinforcements, he determined to carry it by storm. The ships\nopened fire upon the walls; and, under cover of this, half the seamen\nwere landed. These ran up to the gate, and thundered at it with their\naxes.\n\nCharlie and his companions aided the movement, by again opening a\nheavy fire of grape upon the guns which bore upon the sally port; and\nwhen the gates were forced the garrison, utterly dispirited by the\ncrossfire to which they were subjected, at once laid down their arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16. A Tiger Hunt.\n\n\nCommodore James was greatly astonished at the easy success which he\nhad gained. The extraordinary cessation of fire from the sea face, and\nthe sound of artillery within the walls, had convinced him that a\nmutiny among the garrison must have taken place; but upon entering the\nfort he was surprised, indeed, at being received with a hearty English\ncheer, from a little body of men on the summit of an interior work.\nThe gate of this was at once thrown open, and Charlie, followed by his\nparty, advanced towards the commodore.\n\n\"I am Captain Marryat, sir, of the Company's service in Madras; and\nwas captured three months ago by these pirates. When you attacked the\nplace, yesterday, I arranged to effect a small diversion; and with the\nassistance of these five native officers, of my soldier servant, here,\nand these ten men of the merchant service, we have, I hope, been able\nto do so. The native officers disabled the greater portion of the\nguns, during the night; and when you opened fire this morning we\nseized this inner work, which is also the magazine, and opened fire\nupon the rear of the sea defences. By dint of our guns, and of menaces\nto blow up the place if they assaulted it, we kept them at bay until\ntheir flag was hauled down.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" Commodore James said, warmly; \"I have to thank you, most\nheartily, for the assistance you have given. In fact, it is you who\nhave captured the fortress. I was by no means prepared to find it so\nstrong; and, indeed, had come to the conclusion, last night, that the\nforce at my command was wholly insufficient for its capture.\nFortunately, I determined to try the effect of another day's fire.\nBut, had it not been for you, this would assuredly have been as\nineffectual as the first. You have, indeed, performed a most gallant\naction; and I shall have great pleasure in reporting your conduct to\nthe authorities at home.\"\n\nThe sailors had now landed in considerable force. The garrison were\ndisarmed, and taken as prisoners on board the ships. Very large\nquantities of powder were found, stored up, and strong parties at once\nbegan to form mines, for the blowing up of the fortifications.\n\nThis was a labour of some days. When they were completed and charged,\na series of tremendous explosions took place. Many of the bastions\nwere completely blown to pieces. In others, the walls were shattered.\n\nThe prisoners were again landed, and set to work, aided by the\nsailors. The great stones, which composed the walls, were toppled over\nthe steep faces of the rock on which the fort stood; and, at the end\nof a fortnight, the pirate hold of Suwarndrug, which had so long been\nthe terror of the Indian Seas, had disappeared.\n\nThe fleet returned to Bombay; for it was, evidently, wholly\ninsufficient to attempt an assault on Gheriah; defended, as that place\nwould be, by the whole pirate fleet; which had, even without the\nassistance of its guns, proved itself a match for a squadron double\nthe strength of that under the command of Commodore James.\n\nThe rejoicings at Bombay were immense, for enormous damage had been\ninflicted on the commerce of that place, by this pirate hold, situated\nbut eighty miles from the port. Commodore James and his officers were\nfeted, and Charlie Marryat had his full share of honor; the gallant\nsailor, everywhere, assigning to him the credit of its capture.\n\nCharlie would now have sailed, at once, for Madras; but the\nauthorities wished him to remain, as Clive was shortly expected to\narrive, with a considerable force, which was destined to act against\nthe French at Hyderabad. The influence of Bussy, with the nizam,\nrendered this important province little better than a French\npossession; and the territory of our rivals, upon the seacoast, had\nbeen immensely increased by the grant of the five districts, known as\nthe Northern Sirdars, to Bussy.\n\nIt was all that the English could do to hold their own, around Madras;\nand it was out of the question for them to think of attempting, single\nhanded, to dislodge Bussy from Hyderabad. Between the nizam, however,\nand the Peishwar of the Deccan, there was a longstanding feud; and the\nCompany had proposed, to this prince, to aid him with a strong English\nforce, in an attack upon Hyderabad.\n\nColonel Scott had, in the first place, been sent out to command this\nexpedition; but when Clive, wearied with two years' life of inactivity\nin England, applied to be appointed to active service, the directors\nat once appointed him governor of Fort Saint David, and obtained for\nhim the rank of lieutenant colonel in the royal army. They directed\nhim to sail at once for Bombay, with three companies of the Royal\nArtillery, each a hundred strong, and three hundred infantry recruits.\nUpon his arrival there, he was to give Colonel Scott any assistance he\nrequired. That officer, however, had died before Clive arrived.\n\nUpon reaching Bombay, Clive found that events had occurred, in the\nsouth, which would prevent the intended expedition from taking place.\nThe French government had suddenly recalled Dupleix, the great man\nwhose talent and statesmanship had sustained their cause. On his\nreturn to France, instead of treating him with honor for the work he\nhad done for them, they even refused to repay him the large sums which\nhe had advanced, from his private fortune, to carry on the struggle\nagainst the English; and Dupleix died in poverty and obscurity.\n\nIn his place, the French governor had sent out a man by the name of\nGodchen, who was weak and wholly destitute of ability. At the time of\nhis arrival the English were hardly pressed, and a strong French fleet\nand force were expected on the coast. When, however, Mr. Saunders\nproposed to him a treaty of neutrality between the Indian possessions\nof the two powers, he at once accepted it; and thus threw away all the\nadvantages, which Dupleix had struggled so hard to obtain. The result\nof this treaty, however, was that the English were unable to carry out\ntheir proposed alliance, with the peishwar, against the nizam and\nBussy.\n\nUpon Clive's arrival, Charlie at once reported himself to him. For a\ntime, however, no active duty was assigned to him, as it was uncertain\nwhat steps would now be taken. Finally it was resolved that, taking\nadvantage of the presence of Clive and his troops, and of a squadron\nwhich had arrived under Admiral Watson, the work commenced by\nCommodore James should be completed, by the capture of Gheriah and the\nentire destruction of the pirate power.\n\nThe peishwar had already asked them to aid him in his attack upon\nAngria, and Commodore James was now sent, with the Protector and two\nother ships, to reconnoitre Gheriah, which no Englishman then living\nhad seen. The natives described it as of enormous strength, and it was\nbelieved that it was an Eastern Gibraltar.\n\nCommodore James found the enemy's fleet at anchor in the harbour.\nNotwithstanding this, he sailed in until within cannon shot, and so\ncompletely were the enemy cowed and demoralized, by the loss of\nSuwarndrug, that they did not venture out to attack him.\n\nAfter ascertaining the position and character of the defences, he\nreturned, at the end of December, to Bombay; and reported that, while\nexceedingly strong, the place was by no means impregnable. The\nMahratta army, under the command of Ramajee Punt, marched to blockade\nthe place on the land side; and on the 11th of February, 1756, the\nfleet, consisting of four ships of the line, of seventy, sixty-four,\nsixty, and fifty guns; a frigate of forty-four, and three of twenty; a\nnative ship called a grab, of twelve guns; and five mortar ships,\narrived before the place. Besides the seamen, the fleet had on board a\nbattalion of eight hundred Europeans and a thousand Sepoys.\n\nThe fortress of Gheriah was situated on a promontory of rock, a mile\nand a quarter broad; lying about a mile up a large harbour, forming\nthe mouth of a river. The promontory projects to the southwest, on the\nright of the harbour on entering; and rises sheer from the water in\nperpendicular rocks, fifty feet high. On this stood the\nfortifications. These consisted of two lines of walls, with round\ntowers, the inner wall rising several feet above the outer.\n\nThe promontory was joined to the land by a sandy slip, beyond which\nthe town stood. On this neck of land, between the promontory and the\ntown, were the docks and slips on which the pirate vessels were built\nor repaired; and ten of these, among which was the Derby, which they\nhad captured from the Company, lay moored side by side, close by the\ndocks, when the fleet arrived off the place.\n\nCharlie Marryat had been sent, by Clive, as commissioner with the\nMahratta army. A party of Mahratta horsemen came down to Bombay to\nescort him to Chaule, at which place the Mahratta army were assembled\nfor their march. He was accompanied by Tim and Hossein, who were of\ncourse, like him, on horseback.\n\nA long day's ride took them to their first halting place, a few miles\nfrom the foot of a splendid range of hills, which rise like a wall\nfrom the low land, for a vast distance along the coast. At the top of\nthese hills--called in India, ghauts--lay the plateau of the Deccan,\nsloping gradually away to the Ganges, hundreds of miles to the east.\n\n\"Are we going to climb up to top of them mountains, your honor?\"\n\n\"No, Tim, fortunately for our horses. We shall skirt their foot, for a\nhundred and fifty miles, till we get behind Gheriah.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't think that a horse could climb them,\" Tim said. \"They\nlook as steep as the side of a house.\"\n\n\"In many places they are, Tim, but you see there are breaks in them.\nAt some points, either from the force of streams, or from the weather,\nthe rocks have crumbled away; and the great slopes, which everywhere\nextend halfway up, reach the top. Zigzag paths are cut in these, which\ncan be travelled by horses and pack animals.\n\n\"There must be quantities of game,\" Charlie said to the leader of the\nescort, \"on the mountain sides.\"\n\n\"Quantities?\" the Mahratta said. \"Tigers and bears swarm there, and\nare such a scourge that there are no villages within miles of the foot\nof the hills. Even on the plateau above, the villages are few and\nscarce near the edge, so great is the damage done by wild beasts.\n\n\"But that is not all. There are numerous bands of Dacoits, who set the\nauthority of the peishwar at defiance, plunder travellers and\nmerchants going up and down, make raids into the Deccan, and plunder\nthe low land nearly up to the gates of Bombay. Numerous expeditions\nhave been sent against them, but the Dacoits know every foot of the\nhills. They have numerous, impregnable strongholds on the rocks; which\nyou can see rising sheer up hundreds of feet, from among the woods on\nthe slopes; and can, if pressed, shift their quarters, and move fifty\nmiles away among the trees, while the troops are, in vain, searching\nfor them.\"\n\n\"I suppose there is no chance of their attacking us,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"The Dacoit never fights if he can help it, and then only when driven\ninto a corner, or when there appears a chance of very large plunder.\nHe will always leave a strong party of armed men, from whom nothing\nbut hard blows is to be got, in peace.\"\n\nThe journey occupied five days, and was most enjoyable. The officer of\nthe escort, as the peishwar's agent, would have requisitioned\nprovisions at each of the villages; but Charlie insisted, under one\npretence or another, on buying a couple of sheep or kids at each\nhalting place, for the use of his own party and the escort. For a few\ncopper coins an abundant supply of fruit and vegetables was\nobtainable; and as, each night, they spread their rugs under the shade\nof some overhanging tree, and smoked their pipes lazily after the very\nexcellent meal which Hossein always prepared, Charlie and Tim agreed\nthat they had spent no pleasanter time in India than that occupied by\ntheir journey.\n\nCharlie was received with much honor by Ramajee Punt, and was assigned\na gorgeous tent, next to his own.\n\n\"People in England, Mister Charles,\" said Tim that evening, \"turn up\ntheir noses at the thought of living in tents, but what do they know\nof them? The military tent is an uncomfortable thing, and as for the\ngipsy tent, a dacent pig wouldn't look at it. Now this is like a\npalace, with its carpet under foot, and its sides covered with silk\nhangings, and its furniture fit for a palace. Father Murphy wouldn't\nbelieve me, if I told him about it on oath. If this is making war, yer\nhonor, I shall be in no hurry for pace.\"\n\nThe Mahratta force took up its position, beleaguering the town on the\nland side, some weeks before the arrival of the fleet; Commodore\nJames, with his two ships, blockading it at sea. There was little to\ndo, and Charlie accepted with eagerness an offer of Ramajee Punt, that\nthey should go out for two or three days' tiger hunting, at the foot\nof the hills.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Charles,\" Tim said, when he heard of the intention, \"if you\nwant to go tiger hunting, Tim Kelly is not the boy to stay behind. But\nshure, yer honor, if the creeturs will lave ye alone, why should you\nmeddle with them? I saw one in a cage at Arcot, and it's a baste I\nshouldn't wish to see on a lone road on a dark night. It had a way of\nwagging its tail that made you feel uncomfortable like, to the sole of\nyer boots; and after looking at me for some time, the baste opened its\nmouth, and gave a roar that shook the whole establishment. It's a\nbaste safer to let alone than to meddle with.\"\n\n\"But we shall be up on the top of an elephant. We shall be safe enough\nthere, you know.\"\n\n\"Maybe, yer honor,\" Tim said doubtfully; \"but I mind me that, when I\nwas a boy, me and my brother Peter was throwing sods at an old tomcat\nof my mother's, who had stolen our dinners, and it ran up a wall ten\nfeet high. Well, yer honor, the tiger is as big as a hundred tomcats,\nand by the same token he ought to be able to run up a wall--\"\n\n\"A thousand feet high, Tim? He can't do that. Indeed, I question\nwhether he could run up much higher than a cat.\n\n\"We are to start this evening, and shall be there by midnight. The\nelephants have gone on ahead.\"\n\nAt sunset the party started. It consisted of Ramajee Punt, one of his\nfavourite officers, and a score of soldiers. An officer had already\ngone on, to enlist the services of the men of two or three villages as\nbeaters. A small but comfortable tent had been erected for the party,\nand supper prepared.\n\nThe native shikari, or sportsman of the neighbourhood, had brought in\nthe news that tigers were plentiful; and that one of unusual size had\nbeen committing great depredations; and had, only the day before,\ncarried off a bullock into the thickets, a mile from the spot at which\nthey were encamped.\n\n\"The saints preserve us!\" Tim said, when he heard the news; \"a cat big\nenough to carry off a mouse in her mouth as big as a bullock.\"\n\n\"It seems almost impossible, Tim, but it is a fact that tigers can\ncarry in their mouths full-sized bullocks, for considerable distances,\nand that they can kill them with one stroke of their paw. However,\nthey are not as formidable as you would imagine, as you will see,\ntomorrow.\"\n\nIn the morning the elephants were brought out. Charlie took his place\nin the front of a howdah, with Tim behind him. Three rifles were\nplaced in the seat, and these Tim was to hand to his master, as he\ndischarged them. Ramajee Punt and his officer were also mounted on\nelephants, and the party started for their destination.\n\n\"It's as bad as being at sea, Mr. Charles,\" Tim said.\n\n\"It does roll about, Tim. You must let your body go with the motion,\njust as on board ship. You will soon get accustomed to it.\"\n\nOn reaching the spot, which was a narrow valley, with steep sides\nrunning up into the hill, the elephants came to a stand. The mouth of\nthe valley was some fifty yards wide, and the animal might break from\nthe trees at any point. The ground was covered with high, coarse\ngrass.\n\nRamajee Punt placed himself in the centre, assigning to Charlie the\nposition on his right, telling him that it was the best post, as it\nwas on this side the tiger had been seen to enter. Soon after they had\ntaken their places, a tremendous clamour arose near the head of the\nvalley. Drums were beaten, horns blown, and scores of men joined in,\nwith shouts and howls.\n\n\"What on arth are they up to, Mr. Charles?\"\n\n\"They are driving the tiger this way, Tim. Now, sit quiet and keep a\nsharp lookout, and be ready to hand me a rifle, the instant I have\nfired.\"\n\nThe noise increased, and was plainly approaching. The elephant\nfidgeted uneasily.\n\n\"That baste has more sinse than we have,\" said Tim; \"and would be off,\nif that little black chap, astraddle of his neck, didn't keep on\npatting his head.\"\n\nPresently, the mahout pointed silently to the bushes ahead, and\nCharlie caught sight, for a moment, of some yellow fur. Apparently the\ntiger had heard or scented the elephants, for it again turned and made\nup the valley. Presently a redoubled yelling, with the firing of guns,\nshowed that it had been seen by the beaters. Ramajee Punt held up his\nhand to Charlie, as a signal that next time the tiger might be\nexpected.\n\nSuddenly there was a movement among the bushes. A tiger sprang out,\nabout halfway between Charlie's elephant and that of Ramajee Punt. It\npaused for a moment, on seeing them; and then, as it was about to\nspring forward, two balls struck it. It sprang a short distance,\nhowever, and then fell, rolling over and over. One ball had broken a\nforeleg, the other had struck it on the head. Another ball from\nRamajee Punt struck it, as it rolled over and over, and it lay\nimmovable.\n\n\"Why didn't you hand me the next rifle, Tim?\" Charlie said sharply.\n\n\"It went clane out of my head, altogether. To think now, and you kilt\nit in a moment. The tiger is a poor baste, anyhow. I've seen a cat\nmake ten times as strong a fight for its life.\n\n\"Holy Moses!\"\n\nThe last exclamation was called from Tim's lips by a sudden jerk. A\nhuge tiger, far larger than that which had fallen, had sprung up from\nthe brushwood and leaped upon the elephant. With one forepaw he\ngrasped the howdah, with the other clung to the elephant's shoulder,\nan inch or two only behind the leg of the mahout.\n\nCharlie snatched the rifle from Tim's hand, and thrust the muzzle into\nthe tiger's mouth, just as the elephant swerved round with sudden\nfright and pain. At the same moment the weight of the tiger on the\nhowdah caused the girths to give way; and Charlie, Tim and the tiger\nfell together on the ground. Charlie had pulled his trigger, just as\nhe felt himself going; and at the same moment he heard the crack of\nRamajee Punt's rifle.\n\nThe instant they touched the ground, Tim and Charlie cast themselves\nover and over, two or three times; and then leaped to their feet,\nCharlie grasping his rifle, to make the best defence he could if the\ntiger sprang upon him. The creature lay, however, immovable.\n\n\"It is dead, Tim,\" Charlie exclaimed. \"You needn't be afraid.\"\n\n\"And no wonder, yer honor, when I pitched, head first, smack onto his\nstomach. It would have killed a horse.\"\n\n\"It might have done, Tim, but I don't think it would have killed a\ntiger. Look there.\"\n\nCharlie's gun had gone off at the moment when the howdah turned round,\nand had nearly blown off a portion of the tiger's head; while, almost\nat the same instant, the ball of Ramajee Punt had struck it in the\nback, breaking the spine. Death had, fortunately for Tim, been\ninstantaneous.\n\nThe tiger last killed was the great male which had done so much\ndamage; the first, a female. The natives tied the legs together,\nplaced long bamboos between them, and carried the animals off, in\ntriumph, to the camp. The elephant on which Charlie had ridden ran\nsome distance, before the mahout could stop him. He was, indeed, so\nterrified by the onslaught of the tiger, that it was not considered\nadvisable to endeavour to get him to face another, that day. Ramajee\nPunt, therefore, invited Charlie to take his seat with him, on his\nelephant, an arrangement which greatly satisfied Tim, whose services\nwere soon dispensed with.\n\n\"I'd rather walk on my own feet, Mister Charles, than ride any more on\nthose great bastes. They're uncomfortable, anyhow. It's a long way to\nfall, if the saddle goes round; and next time one might not find a\ntiger handy, to light on.\"\n\nTwo more tigers were killed that afternoon and, well pleased with his\nday's sport, Charlie returned to the hunting camp.\n\nThe next day, Hossein begged that he might be allowed to accompany\nCharlie in Tim's place; and as the Irishman was perfectly willing to\nsurrender it, the change was agreed upon. The march was a longer one\nthan it had been, on the previous morning. A notorious man-eating\ntiger was known to have taken up his abode, in a large patch of\njungle, at the foot of an almost perpendicular wall of rock, about ten\nmiles from the place where the camp was pitched. The patch of jungle\nstood upon a steep terrace, whose slopes were formed of boulders, the\npatch being some fifty or sixty yards long and thirty deep.\n\n\"It is a nasty place,\" Ramajee Punt said, \"to get him from. The\nbeaters cannot get behind to drive him out, and the jungle is too\nthick to penetrate.\"\n\n\"How do you intend to proceed?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"We will send a party to the top of the hill, and they will throw down\ncrackers. We have brought some rockets, too, which we will send in\nfrom the other side. We will take our places, on our elephants, at the\nfoot of the terrace.\"\n\nThe three elephants took their posts, at the foot of the boulder\ncovered rise. As soon as they had done so, the men at the top of the\nrock began to throw down numbers of lighted crackers; while, from\neither side, parties sent rockets whizzing into the jungle.\n\nFor some time the tiger showed no signs of his presence, and Charlie\nbegan to doubt whether he could be really there. The shikaris,\nhowever, declared that he was certainly in the jungle. He had, on the\nday before, carried off a woman from a neighbouring village; and had\nbeen traced to the jungle, round which a watch had been kept all\nnight.\n\nSuddenly, uttering a mighty roar, the tiger bounded from the jungle,\nand stood at the edge of the terrace. Startled at his sudden\nappearance, the elephants recoiled, shaking the aim of their riders.\nThree shots were, however, fired almost at the same moment; and the\ntiger, with another roar, bounded back into the jungle.\n\n\"I think,\" the rajah said, \"that he is badly hit. Listen to his\nroarings.\"\n\nThe tiger, for a time, roared loudly at intervals. Then the sounds\nbecame lower and less frequent, and at last ceased altogether. In vain\ndid the natives above shower down crackers. In vain were the rockets\ndischarged into the jungle. An hour passed, since he had last been\nheard.\n\n\"I expect that he's dead,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I think so, too,\" Ramajee Punt replied; \"but one can never be\ncertain. Let us draw off a little, and take our luncheon. After that,\nwe can try the fireworks again. If he will not move, then we must\nleave him.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" Charlie said, \"we might go in and see whether he's dead\nor not.\"\n\n\"A wounded tiger is a terrible foe,\" the Ramajee answered. \"Better\nleave him alone.\"\n\nCharlie, however, was anxious to get the skin to send home, with those\nof the others he had shot, to his mother and sisters. It might be very\nlong before he had an opportunity of joining in another tiger hunt;\nand he resolved that, if the tiger gave no signs of life when the\nbombardment of the jungle with fireworks recommenced, he would go in\nand look for his body.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17. The Capture Of Gheriah.\n\n\nAfter having sat for an hour under the shade of some trees, and\npartaken of luncheon, the party again moved forward on their elephants\nto the jungle. The watchers declared that no sound, whatever, had been\nheard during their absence; nor did the discharge of fireworks, which\nat once recommenced, elicit the slightest response.\n\nAfter this had gone on for half an hour, Charlie, convinced that the\nanimal was dead, dismounted from his elephant. He had with him a\nheavy, double-barrelled rifle of the rajah's; and Hossein, carrying a\nsimilar weapon, and a curved tulwar which was sharpened almost to a\nrazor edge, prepared to follow immediately behind him. Three or four\nof the most courageous shikaris, with cocked guns, followed in\nHossein's steps.\n\nHolding his gun advanced before him, in readiness to fire instantly,\nCharlie entered the jungle at the point where the tiger had retreated\ninto it. Drops of blood spotted the grass, and the bent and twisted\nbrushwood showed the path that the tiger had taken. Charlie moved as\nnoiselessly as possible. The path led straight forward, towards the\nrocks behind, but it was not until within four or five yards of this\nthat any sign of the tiger could be seen.\n\nThen the bushes were burst asunder, and the great yellow body hurled\nitself forward upon Charlie. The attack was so sudden and\ninstantaneous that the latter had not even time to raise his rifle to\nhis shoulder. Almost instinctively, however, he discharged both of the\nbarrels; but was, at the same moment, hurled to the ground, where he\nlay crushed down by the weight of the tiger, whose hot breath he could\nfeel on his face. He closed his eyes, only to open them again at the\nsound of a heavy blow, while a deluge of hot blood flowed over him. He\nheard Hossein's voice, and then became insensible. When he recovered,\nhe found himself lying with his head supported by Hossein, outside the\njungle.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" he asked faintly.\n\n\"He is dead, Sahib,\" Hossein replied. \"Let the Sahib drink some\nbrandy, and he will be strong again.\"\n\nCharlie drank some brandy and water, which Hossein held to his lips.\nThen the latter raised him to his feet.\n\nCharlie felt his limbs and his ribs. He was bruised all over, but\notherwise unhurt, the blood which covered him having flowed from the\ntiger. One of the balls which he had fired had entered the tiger's\nneck, the other had broken one of its forelegs, and Charlie had been\nknocked down by the weight of the animal, not by the blow of its\nformidable paw.\n\nHossein had sprung forward on the instant, and with one blow of his\nsharp tulwar, had shorn clear through skin and muscle and bone, and\nhad almost severed the tiger's head from its body. It was the weight\nupon him which had crushed Charlie into a state of insensibility. Here\nhe had lain, for four or five minutes, before Hossein could get the\nfrightened natives to return, and assist him to lift the great carcass\nfrom his master's body.\n\nUpon examination, it was found that two of the three bullets first\nfired had taken effect. One had broken the tiger's shoulder, and\nlodged in his body. The other had struck him fairly on the chest, and\nhad passed within an inch or two of his heart.\n\n\"I thought,\" Ramajee Punt said, as he viewed the body, \"that one of\nhis legs must have been rendered useless. That was why he lay quiet so\nlong, in spite of our efforts to turn him out.\"\n\nCharlie was too much hurt to walk, and a litter was speedily formed,\nand he was carried back to the camp, where his arrival in that state\nexcited the most lively lamentations on the part of Tim. The next\nmorning he was much recovered; and was able, in the cool of the\nevening, to take his place in a howdah, and to return to the camp\nbefore Gheriah.\n\nA few days later the fleet made its appearance off the town, and the\nsame evening Tulagi Angria rode up to Ramajee Punt's camp. Charlie was\npresent at the interview, at which Angria endeavoured to prevail on\nRamajee Punt, and Charlie, to accept a large ransom for his fort;\noffering them each great presents, if they would do their utmost to\nprevail on Admiral Watson, and Colonel Clive, to agree to accept it.\n\nCharlie said at once that he was sure it was useless, that the English\nhad now made a great effort to put a stop to the ravages which he, and\nhis father before him, had for so many years inflicted upon their\ncommerce; and that he was sure that nothing, short of the total\ndestruction of the fort and fleet, would satisfy them. The meeting\nthen broke up; and Charlie, supposing that Angria would return\nimmediately, went back to his tent; where he directed Hossein at once\nto mingle with the men who had accompanied Angria, and to find out\nanything that he could concerning the state of things in the fort.\n\nHossein returned an hour later.\n\n\"Sahib,\" he said, \"Ramajee Punt is thinking of cheating the English.\nHe is keeping Angria a prisoner. He says that he came into his camp\nwithout asking for a safe conduct; and that, therefore, he shall\ndetain him.\n\n\"But this is not all. Angria has left his brother in command of the\nfort; and Ramajee, by threatening Angria with instant execution, has\ninduced him to send an order to deliver the fort at once to him.\nRamajee wants, you see, Sahib, to get all the plunder of the fort for\nhimself, and his Mahrattas.\"\n\n\"This is very serious,\" Charlie said, \"and I must let the admiral\nknow, at once, what is taking place.\"\n\nWhen it became dark, Charlie, with Tim and Hossein, made his way\nthrough the Mahratta camp, down to the shore of the river. Here were\nnumbers of boats, hauled up on the sand. One of the lightest of these\nwas soon got into the water, and rowed gently out into the force of\nthe stream. Then the oars were shipped, and they lay down perfectly\nquiet in the boat, and drifted past the fort without being observed.\n\nWhen they once gained the open sea, the oars were placed in the\nrowlocks, and half an hour's rowing brought them alongside the fleet.\nCharlie was soon on board the flagship, and informed the admiral, and\nColonel Clive, what Hossein had heard.\n\nIt was at once resolved to attack upon the following day. The two\nofficers did not think it was likely that the pirates would, even in\nobedience to their chief's orders, surrender the place until it had\nbeen battered by the fleet.\n\nThe next morning, the fort was summoned to surrender. No answer was\nreceived, and as soon as the sea breeze set in, in the afternoon, the\nfleet weighed anchor and proceeded towards the mouth of the river. The\nmen-of-war were in line, on the side nearest to the fort, to protect\nthe mortar vessels and smaller ships from its fire.\n\nPassing the point of the promontory, they stood into the river, and\nanchored at a distance of fifty yards from the north face of the fort.\nA gun from the admiral's ship gave the signal, and a hundred and fifty\npieces of cannon at once opened fire, while the mortar vessels threw\nshell into the fort and town. In ten minutes after the fire began, a\nshell fell into one of Angria's large ships, and set her on fire. The\nflames soon spread to the others, fastened together on either side of\nher, and in less than an hour this fleet, which had for fifty years\nbeen the terror of the Malabar coast, was utterly destroyed.\n\nIn the meantime the fleet kept up their fire, with the greatest\nvigour, upon the enemy's works; and, before nightfall, the enemy's\nfire was completely silenced. No white flag, however, was hung up, and\nthe admiral had little doubt that it was intended to surrender the\nplace to the Mahrattas.\n\nAs soon, therefore, as it became quite dark, Colonel Clive landed with\nthe troops, and took up a position between the Mahrattas and the fort;\nwhere, to his great disappointment and disgust, Ramajee Punt found him\nin the morning. The admiral again summoned the fort, declaring that he\nwould renew the attack, and give no quarter, unless it was surrendered\nimmediately. The governor sent back to beg the admiral to cease from\nhostilities until next day, as he was only waiting for orders from\nAngria to surrender. Angria declared that he had already sent the\norders.\n\nAt four in the afternoon, therefore, the bombardment was renewed; and\nin less than half an hour, a white flag appeared above the wall. As,\nhowever, the garrison made no further sign of surrender, and refused\nto admit Colonel Clive with his troops, when he advanced to take\npossession, the bombardment was again renewed, more vigorously than\never. The enemy were unable to support the violence of the fire, and\nsoon shouted over the walls, to Clive, that they surrendered; and he\nmight enter and take possession. He at once marched in, and the\npirates laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners.\n\nIt was found that a great part of the fortifications had been\ndestroyed by the fire, but a resolute garrison might have held the\nfort, itself, against a long siege. Two hundred guns fell into the\nhands of the captors, together with great quantities of ammunition,\nand stores of all kinds. The money and effects amounted to a hundred\nand twenty thousand pounds, which was divided among the captors. The\nrest of Angria's fleet, among them two large ships on the stocks, was\ndestroyed.\n\nRamajee Punt sent parties of his troops to attack the other forts held\nby the pirates. These, however, surrendered without resistance, and\nthus the whole country, which the pirates had held for seventy years,\nfell again into the hands of the Mahrattas, from whom they had wrested\nit.\n\nAdmiral Watson and the fleet then returned to Bombay, in order to\nrepair the damages which had been inflicted upon them during the\nbombardment. There were great rejoicings upon their arrival there; the\njoy of the inhabitants, both European and native, being immense at the\ndestruction of the formidable pirate colonies, which had so long\nravaged the seas.\n\nAfter the repairs were completed, the fleet, with the troops which had\nformed the expedition, were to sail for Madras. Charlie, however, did\nnot wait for this; but, finding that one of the Company's ships would\nsail, in the course of a few days after their return to Bombay, he\nobtained leave from Colonel Clive to take a passage in her, and to\nproceed immediately to Madras. Tim and Hossein, of course, accompanied\nhim; and the voyage down the west coast of India, and round Ceylon,\nwas performed without any marked incident.\n\nWhen within but a few hours of Madras, the barometer fell rapidly.\nGreat clouds rose up upon the horizon, and the captain ordered all\nhands aloft to reduce sail.\n\n\"We are in,\" he said, \"for a furious tempest. It is the breaking up of\nthe monsoon. It is a fortnight earlier than usual. I had hoped that we\nshould have got safely up the Hoogly before it began.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the hurricane struck them, and for the next three\ndays the tempest was terrible. Great waves swept over the ship, and\nevery time that the captain attempted to show a rag of canvas, it was\nblown from the bolt ropes. The ship, however, was a stout one, and\nweathered the gale.\n\nUpon the fourth morning the passengers, who had, during the tempest,\nbeen battened below, came on deck. The sky was bright and clear, and\nthe waves were fast going down. A good deal of sail was already set,\nand the hands were at work to repair damages.\n\n\"Well, captain,\" Charlie said to that officer, \"I congratulate you on\nthe behaviour of the ship. It has been a tremendous gale, and she has\nweathered it stoutly.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Marryat, she has done well. I have only once or twice\nbeen out in so severe a storm, since I came to sea.\"\n\n\"And where are we now?\" Charlie asked, looking round the horizon.\n\"When shall we be at Madras?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the captain said with a smile, \"I am afraid that you must give\nup all idea of seeing Madras, just at present. We have been blown\nright up the bay, and are only a few hours' sail from the mouth of the\nHoogly. I have a far larger cargo for that place than for Madras, and\nit would be a pure waste of time for me to put back now. I intend,\ntherefore, to go to Calcutta first, discharge and fill up there, and\nthen touch at Madras on my way back.\n\n\"I suppose it makes no great difference to you.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" Charlie said. \"And I am by no means sorry of the\nopportunity of getting a glimpse of Calcutta, which I might never\notherwise have done. I believe things are pretty quiet at Madras, at\npresent; and I have been so long away, now, that a month or two sooner\nor later will make but little difference.\"\n\nA few hours later, Charlie noticed a change in the colour of the sea,\nthe mud-stained waters of the Hoogly discolouring the Bay of Bengal,\nfar out from its mouth. The voyage up was a tedious one. At times the\nwind fell altogether and, unable to stem the stream, the ship lay for\ndays at anchor, the yellow tide running swiftly by it.\n\n\"The saints presarve us, Mr. Charles! Did you ever see the like?\" Tim\nKelly exclaimed. \"There's another dead body, floating down towards us,\nand that is the eighth I've seen this morning. Are the poor hathen\ncraturs all committing suicide together?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Tim,\" Charlie said, \"the Hoogly is one of the sacred\nrivers of India, and the people on its banks, instead of burying their\ndead, put them into the river and let them drift away.\"\n\n\"I calls it a bastly custom, yer honor, and I wonder it is allowed.\nOne got athwart the cable this morning, and it frightened me nigh out\nof my sinses, when I happened to look over the bow, and saw the thing\nbobbing up and down in the water.\n\n\"This is tedious work, yer honor, and I'll be glad when we're at the\nend of the voyage.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad, too, Tim. We have been a fortnight in the river\nalready. But I think there is a breeze getting up, and there is the\ncaptain on deck, giving orders.\"\n\nIn a few minutes, the ship was under way again, and the same night\ndropped her anchor in the stream, abreast of Calcutta. Charlie shortly\nafter landed, and, proceeding to the Company's offices, reported his\narrival, and that of the four Sepoy officers. Hossein, who was not in\nthe Company's service, was with him merely in the character of a\nservant.\n\nAs the news of the share Charlie had had in the capture of Suwarndrug\nhad reached Calcutta, he was well received; and one of the leading\nmerchants of the town, Mr. Haines, who happened to be present when\nCharlie called upon the governor, at once invited him warmly to take\nup his residence with him, during his stay. Hospitality in India was\nprofuse, and general. Hotels were unknown, and a stranger was always\ntreated as an honored guest.\n\nCharlie, therefore, had no hesitation whatever in accepting the offer.\nThe four native officers were quartered in the barracks; and,\nreturning on board ship, Charlie, followed by Tim and Hossein, and by\nsome coolies bearing his luggage, was soon on his way to the bungalow\nof Mr. Haines.\n\nOn his way, he was surprised at the number and size of the dwellings\nof the merchants and officials, which offered a very strong contrast\nto the quiet and unpretending buildings round the fort of Madras. The\nhouse of Mr. Haines was a large one, and stood in a large and\ncarefully kept garden. Mr. Haines received him at the door, and at\nonce led him to his room, which was spacious, cool, and airy. Outside\nwas a wide veranda, upon which, in accordance with the customs of the\ncountry, servants would sleep.\n\n\"Here is your bathroom,\" Mr. Haines said, pointing to an adjoining\nroom. \"I think you will find everything ready. We dine in half an\nhour.\"\n\nCharlie was soon in his bath, a luxury which, in India, every European\nindulges in at least twice a day. Then in his cool white suit, which\nat that time formed the regular evening dress, he found his way to the\ndrawing room. Here he was introduced to the merchant's wife, and to\nhis daughter, a girl of some thirteen years old, as well as to several\nguests who had arrived for dinner.\n\nThe meal was a pleasant one, and Charlie, after being cooped up for\nsome weeks on board ship, enjoyed it much. A dinner in India is, to\none unaccustomed to it, a striking sight. The punkah waving slowly to\nand fro, overhead, drives the cool air which comes in through the open\nwindows down upon the table. Each guest brings his own servant, who,\neither in white or coloured robes, and in turbans of many different\nhues and shapes, according to the wearer's caste, stands behind his\nmaster's chair. The light is always a soft one, and the table richly\ngarnished with bright-coloured tropical flowers.\n\nCharlie was the hero of the hour, and was asked many questions\nconcerning the capture of Suwarndrug; and also about the defence of\nAmbur, which, though now an old story, had excited the greatest\ninterest through India. Presently, however, the conversation turned to\nlocal topics; and Charlie learned, from the anxious looks and earnest\ntones of the speakers, that the situation was considered a very\nserious one. He asked but few questions, then; but after the guests\nhad retired, and Mr. Haines proposed to him to smoke one more quiet\ncigar, in the cool of the veranda, before retiring to bed; he took the\nopportunity of asking his host to explain to him the situation, with\nwhich he had no previous acquaintance.\n\n\"Up to the death of Ali Kerdy, the old viceroy of Bengal, on the 9th\nApril, we were on good terms with our native neighbours. Calcutta has\nnot been, like Madras, threatened by the rivalry of a European\nneighbour. The French and Dutch, indeed, have both trading stations\nlike our own, but none of us have taken part in native affairs. Ali\nKerdy has been all powerful, there have been no native troubles, and\ntherefore no reason for our interference. We have just gone on as for\nmany years previously, as a purely trading company.\n\n\"At his death, he was succeeded in the government by Suraja Dowlah,\nhis grandson. I suppose, in all India, there is no prince with a worse\nreputation than this young scoundrel has already gained for himself,\nfor profligacy and cruelty. He is constantly drunk, and is surrounded\nby a crew of reprobates, as wicked as himself. At the death of Ali\nKerdy, Sokut Jung, another grandson of Ali, set up in opposition to\nhim, and the new viceroy raised a large force to march against him. As\nthe reputation of Sokut Jung was as infamous as that of his cousin, it\nwould have made little difference to us which of the two obtained the\nmastery.\n\n\"Within the last few days, however, circumstances have occurred which\nhave completely altered the situation. The town of Dacca was, about a\nyear ago, placed under the governorship of Rajah Ragbullub, a Hindoo\nofficer in high favour with Ali Kerdy. His predecessor had been\nassassinated and plundered, by order of Suraja Dowlah; and when he\nheard of the accession of that prince, he determined at once to fly,\nas he knew that his great wealth would speedily cause him to be marked\nout as a victim. He therefore obtained a letter of recommendation from\nMr. Watts, the agent of the Company at their factory at Cossimbazar;\nand sent his son Kissendas, with a large retinue, his family and\ntreasures, to Calcutta.\n\n\"Two or three days after his accession, Suraja Dowlah despatched a\nletter to Mr. Drake, our governor, ordering him to surrender Kissendas\nand the treasures immediately. The man whom he sent down arrived in a\nsmall boat, without any state or retinue; and Mr. Drake, believing\nthat he was an impostor, paid no attention to the demand, but expelled\nhim from the settlement. Two days ago a letter came from the viceroy;\nor, as we generally call him, the nabob, to Mr. Drake, ordering him\ninstantly to demolish all the fortifications which he understood he\nhad been erecting. Mr. Drake has sent word back, assuring the nabob\nthat he is erecting no new fortifications, but simply executing some\nrepairs in the ramparts facing the river, in view of the expected war\nbetween England and France.\n\n\"That is all that has been done, at present; but, seeing the\npassionate and overbearing disposition of this young scoundrel, there\nis no saying what will come of it.\"\n\n\"But how do we stand here?\" Charlie asked. \"What are the means of\ndefence, supposing he should take it into his head to march, with the\narmy which he has raised to fight against his cousin, to the attack of\nCalcutta?\"\n\n\"Nothing could be worse than our position,\" Mr. Haines said. \"Ever\nsince the capture of Madras, nine years ago, the directors have been\nsending out orders that this place should be put in a state of\ndefence. During the fifty years which have passed peacefully here, the\nfortifications have been entirely neglected. Instead of the space\nround them being kept clear, warehouses have been built close against\nthem, and the fort is wholly unable to resist any attack. The\nauthorities of the Company here have done absolutely nothing to carry\nout the orders from home. They think, I am sorry to say, only of\nmaking money with their own trading ventures; and although several\npetitions have been presented to them, by the merchants here, urging\nupon them the dangers which might arise at the death of Ali, they have\ntaken no steps whatever, and indeed have treated all warnings with\nscorn and derision.\"\n\n\"What force have we here?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"Only a hundred and seventy-four men, of whom the greater portion are\nnatives.\"\n\n\"What sort of man is your commander?\"\n\n\"We have no means of knowing,\" Mr. Haines said. \"His name is Minchin.\nHe is a great friend of the governor's, and has certainly done nothing\nto counteract the apathy of the authorities. Altogether, to my mind,\nthings look as bad as they possibly can.\"\n\nA week later, on the 15th of June, a messenger arrived with the news\nthat the nabob, with fifty thousand men, was advancing against the\ntown; and that, in two days, he would appear before it. All was\nconfusion and alarm. Charlie at once proceeded to the fort, and placed\nhis services at the disposal of Captain Minchin. He found that officer\nfussy, and alarmed.\n\n\"If I might be permitted to advise,\" Charlie said, \"every available\nman in the town should be set to work, at once, pulling down all the\nbuildings around the walls. It would be clearly impossible to defend\nthe place when the ramparts are, on all sides, commanded by the\nmusketry fire of surrounding buildings.\"\n\n\"I know what my duty is, sir,\" Captain Minchin said, \"and do not\nrequire to be taught it, by so very young an officer as yourself.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" Charlie replied, calmly. \"I have seen a great deal\nof service, and have taken part in the defence of two besieged towns;\nwhile you, I believe, have never seen a shot fired. However, as you're\nin command you will, of course, take what steps you think fit; but I\nwarn you that, unless those buildings are destroyed, the fort cannot\nresist an assault for twenty-four hours.\"\n\nThen, bowing quietly, he retired; and returned to Mr. Haines' house.\nThat gentleman was absent, having gone to the governor's. He did not\ncome back until late in the evening. Charlie passed the time in\nendeavouring to cheer up Mrs. Haines, and her daughter; assuring them\nthat, if the worst came to the worst, there could be no difficulty in\ntheir getting on board ship.\n\nMrs. Haines was a woman of much common sense and presence of mind;\nand, under the influence of Charlie's quiet chat, she speedily\nrecovered her tranquillity. Her daughter Ada, who was a very bright\nand pretty girl, was even sooner at her ease, and they were laughing\nand chatting brightly, when Mr. Haines arrived. He looked fagged and\ndispirited.\n\n\"Drake is a fool,\" he said. \"Just as, hitherto, he has scoffed at all\nthought of danger, now he is prostrated at the news that danger is at\nhand. He can decide on nothing. At one moment he talks of sending\nmessengers to Suraja Dowlah, to offer to pay any sum he may demand, in\norder to induce him to retire; the next he talks of defending the fort\nto the last. We can get him to give no orders, to decide on nothing,\nand the other officials are equally impotent and imbecile.\"\n\nOn the 18th, the army of the nabob approached. Captain Minchin took\nhis guns and troops a considerable distance beyond the walls, and\nopened fire upon the enemy. Charlie, enraged and disgusted at the\nfolly of conduct which could only lead to defeat, marched with them as\na simple volunteer.\n\nThe result was what he had anticipated. The enemy opened fire with an\nimmensely superior force of artillery. His infantry advanced, and\nclouds of horsemen swept round the flanks, and menaced the retreat. In\na very few minutes, Captain Minchin gave the order to retire; and,\nabandoning their guns, the English force retreated in all haste to the\ntown.\n\nCharlie had, on setting out, told Mr. Haines what was certain to\noccur; and had implored him to send all his valuables, at once, on\nboard ship; and to retire instantly into the fort. Upon the arrival of\nthe troops at the gate, they found it almost blocked with the throng\nof frightened Europeans, and natives, flying from their houses beyond\nit to its protection. Scarcely were all the fugitives within, and the\ngates closed, when the guns of Suraja Dowlah opened upon the fort; and\nhis infantry, taking possession of the houses around it, began a\ngalling musketry fire upon the ramparts.\n\nCaptain Minchin remained closeted with the governor; and Charlie,\nfinding the troops bewildered and dismayed, without leading or orders,\nassumed the command, placed them upon the walls, and kept up a\nvigorous musketry fire in reply to that of the enemy.\n\nWithin, all was confusion and dismay. In every spot sheltered from the\nenemy's fire, Europeans and natives were huddled together. There was\nneither head nor direction. With nightfall the fire ceased, but still\nMr. Drake and Captain Minchin were undecided what steps to take. At\ntwo o'clock in the morning, they summoned a council of war, at which\nCharlie was present, and it was decided that the women and children\nshould at once be sent on board.\n\nThere should have been no difficulty in carrying this into effect. A\nlarge number of merchantmen were lying in the stream, opposite the\nfort, capable of conveying away in safety the whole of the occupants.\nTwo of the members of the council had, early in the evening, been\ndespatched on board ship to make arrangements for the boats being sent\non shore; but these cowardly wretches, instead of doing so, ordered\nthe ships to raise their anchors, and drop two miles farther down the\nstream. The boats, however, were sent up the river to the fort.\n\nThe same helpless imbecility, which had characterized every movement,\nagain showed itself. There was no attempt, whatever, at establishing\nanything like order or method. The watergate was open, and a wild rush\nof men, women, and children took place down to the boats.\n\nCharlie was on duty, on the walls. He had already said goodbye to Mrs.\nHaines and her daughter, and though he heard shouts and screams coming\nfrom the watergate, he had no idea what had taken place; until Mr.\nHaines joined him.\n\n\"Have you seen them safely off?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"My wife has gone,\" Mr. Haines said. \"My daughter is still here. There\nhas been a horrible scene of confusion. Although the boats were amply\nsufficient to carry all, no steps whatever had been taken to secure\norder. The consequence was, there was a wild rush. Women and children\nwere knocked down and trampled upon. They leaped into the boats in\nsuch wild haste that several of these were capsized, and numbers of\npeople drowned. I kept close to my wife and child, till we reached the\nside of the stream. I managed to get my wife into a boat, and then a\nrush of people separated me from my daughter; and before I could find\nher again, the remaining boats had all pushed off. Many of the men\nhave gone with them, and among them, I am ashamed to say, several of\nthe officers.\n\n\"However, I trust the boats will come up again tomorrow, and take away\nthe rest. Two have remained, a guard having been placed over them, and\nI hope to get Ada off to her mother, in the morning.\"\n\nTowards morning, Mr. Haines again joined Charlie.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he said. \"Those cowardly villains, Drake and\nMinchin, have taken the two boats, and gone off on board ship!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" Charlie exclaimed.\n\n\"It is too true,\" Mr. Haines said. \"The names of these cowards should\nbe held as infamous, as long as the English nation exists.\n\n\"Come, now, we are just assembling to choose a commander. Mr. Peeks is\nthe senior agent; but I think we shall elect Mr. Holwell, who is an\nenergetic and vigorous man.\"\n\nIt was as Mr. Haines had expected. Mr. Holwell was elected, and at\nonce took the lead. He immediately assigned to Charlie the command of\nthe troops. Little was done at the council, beyond speaker after\nspeaker rising to express his execration of the conduct of the\ngovernor and Captain Minchin.\n\nWith daybreak, the enemy's fire recommenced. All day long Charlie\nhurried from post to post, encouraging his men, and aiding in working\nthe guns. Two or three times, when the enemy showed in masses, as if\nintending to assault, the fire of the artillery drove them back; and\nup to nightfall they had gained but little success. The civilians as\nwell as the soldiers had done their duty nobly, but the loss had been\nheavy, from the fire of the enemy's sharpshooters in the surrounding\nbuildings; and it was evident that, however gallant the defence, the\nfort could not much longer resist.\n\nAll day long, signals had been kept flying for the fleet, two miles\nbelow, to come up to the fort; but although these could be plainly\nseen, not a ship weighed anchor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18. The \"Black Hole\" Of Calcutta.\n\n\nWhen the fire of the enemy slackened, Charlie went to Mr. Holwell.\n\n\"It is impossible, sir,\" he said, \"that the fort can hold out; for in\nanother three or four days, the whole of the garrison will be killed.\nThe only hope of safety is for the ships to come up, and remove the\ngarrison, which they can do without the slightest danger to\nthemselves. If you will allow me, sir, I will swim down to the ships,\nand represent our situation. Cowardly and inhuman as Mr. Drake has\nproved himself, he can hardly refuse to give orders for the fleet to\nmove.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mr. Holwell. \"After the way in which he has\nbehaved, there are no depths of infamy of which I believe him\nincapable. But you are my right hand here. Supposing Mr. Drake\nrefuses, you could not return.\"\n\n\"I will come back, sir,\" Charlie answered. \"I will, if there be no\nother way, make my way along by the river bank. It is comparatively\nfree of the enemy, as our guns command it. If you will place Mr.\nHaines at the corner bastion, with a rope, he will recognize my voice,\nand I can regain the fort.\"\n\nMr. Holwell consented, and as soon as it was perfectly dark, Charlie\nissued out at the watergate, took off his coat, waistcoat, and boots,\nand entered the stream. The current was slack, but he had no\ndifficulty in keeping himself afloat until he saw, close ahead of him,\nthe lights of the ships.\n\nHe hailed that nearest him. A rope was thrown, and he was soon on\nboard. Upon stating who he was, a boat was at once lowered, and he was\ntaken to the ship upon which Mr. Drake and Captain Minchin had taken\nrefuge. Upon saying that he was the bearer of a message from the\ngentleman now commanding the fort, he was conducted to the cabin,\nwhere Mr. Drake and Captain Minchin, having finished their dinner,\nwere sitting comfortably over their wine with Captain Young, the\nsenior captain of the Company's ships there.\n\n\"I have come, sir,\" Charlie said to Mr. Drake, \"from Mr. Holwell; who\nhas, in your absence, been elected to the command of the fort. He bids\nme tell you that our losses have been already very heavy, and that it\nis impossible that the fort can hold out for more than twenty-four\nhours longer. He begs you, therefore, to order up the ships tonight,\nin order that the garrison may embark.\"\n\n\"It is quite out of the question,\" Mr. Drake said coldly. \"Quite. It\nwould be extremely dangerous.\n\n\"You agree with me, Captain Young, that it would be most dangerous?\"\n\n\"I consider that it would be dangerous,\" Captain Young said.\n\n\"And you call yourself,\" Charlie exclaimed indignantly, \"a British\nsailor! You talk of danger, and would desert a thousand men, women,\nand children, including two hundred of your own countrymen, and leave\nthem at the mercy of an enemy!\"\n\n\"You forget whom you are speaking to, sir,\" Mr. Drake said, angrily.\n\n\"I forgot nothing, sir,\" Charlie replied, trying to speak calmly.\n\"Then, sir, Mr. Holwell has charged me that if--which, however, he\ncould not believe for a moment to be possible--you refuse to move up\nthe ships to receive the garrison on board, that you would at least\norder all the boats up, as these would be amply sufficient to carry\nthem away. Even in the daytime there would be no danger for the ships;\nand at night, at least, boats might come up, without being exposed to\nany risk whatever.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly do nothing of the sort,\" Mr. Drake said. \"The\ndanger is even greater for the boats than for the ships.\"\n\n\"And am I, sir, to return to the garrison of that fort, with the news\nthat you utterly desert them, that you intend to remain quietly here,\nwhile they are sacrificed before your eyes? Is it possible that you\nare capable of such infamy as this?\"\n\n\"Infamy!\" exclaimed the three men, rising to their feet.\n\n\"I place you in arrest at once, for your insolence,\" Mr. Drake said.\n\n\"I despise your arrest, as I do yourself.\n\n\"I did not believe it possible,\" Charlie said, at last giving vent to\nhis anger and scorn; \"and England will not believe, that three\nEnglishmen so cowardly, so infamous as yourselves, are to be found.\n\n\"As for you, Captain Minchin, if ever after this I come across you, I\nwill flog you publicly first, and shoot you afterwards like a dog, if\nyou dare to meet me.\n\n\"As for you, Mr. Drake--as for you, Captain Young--you will be doomed\nto infamy, by the contempt and loathing which Englishmen will feel,\nwhen this deed is known.\n\n\"Cowards; base, infamous cowards!\"\n\nCharlie stepped back to go.\n\n\"Seize him!\" Mr. Drake said, himself rushing forward.\n\nCharlie drew back a step; and then, with all his strength, smote the\ngovernor between the eyes, and he fell in a heap beneath the table.\nThen Charlie grasped a decanter.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"if either of you hounds move a finger, I'll brain\nyou.\"\n\nThe two officers stood paralysed. Charlie walked to the door, and\nsprang up the cabin stairs; and, as he did so, heard shouts for\nassistance from behind. He gained the deck, walked quietly to the\nbulwark and, placing his hand upon it, sprang over the side into the\nriver. He swam to shore and, climbing up the bank, made his way along\nit back to the fort, where he arrived without any misadventure.\n\nA fury of indignation seized all in the fort, when the result of\nCharlie's mission became known. With daybreak the attack recommenced;\nbut the garrison, all day, bravely repulsed every attempt of the enemy\nto gain a footing. The fire from the houses was, however, so severe,\nthat by nightfall nearly half the garrison were killed or wounded.\n\nAll day the signals to the fleet were kept flying, but not a ship\nmoved. All night, an anxious watch was kept, in hopes that, at the\nlast moment, some returning feeling of shame might induce the\nrecreants to send up the boats of the ships. But the night passed\nwithout a movement on the river, and in the morning the fleet were\nseen, still lying at anchor.\n\nThe enemy recommenced the attack, even more vigorously than before.\nThe men fell fast and, to Charlie's great grief, his friend Mr. Haines\nwas shot by a bullet, as he was standing next to him. Charlie\nanxiously knelt beside him.\n\n\"It is all over with me,\" he murmured. \"Poor little Ada. Do all you\ncan for her, Marryat. God knows what fate is in store for her.\"\n\n\"I will protect her with my life, sir,\" Charlie said earnestly.\n\nMr. Haines pressed his hand feebly, in token of gratitude; and, two or\nthree minutes later, breathed his last.\n\nBy midday, the loss had been so heavy that the men would no longer\nstand to their guns. Many of the European soldiers broke open the\nspirit stores, and soon drank to intoxication.\n\nAfter a consultation with his officers, Mr. Holwell agreed that\nfurther resistance was hopeless. The flag of truce was therefore\nhoisted, and one of the officers at once started for the nabob's camp,\nwith instructions to make the best terms he could for the garrison.\nWhen the gates were opened the enemy, seizing the opportunity, rushed\nin in great numbers; and as resistance was impossible, the garrison\nlaid down their arms.\n\nCharlie at once hurried to the spot where Ada, and the only other\nEuropean lady who had not escaped, were anxiously awaiting news. Both\nwere exhausted with weeping.\n\n\"Where is papa, Captain Marryat?\" Ada asked.\n\nCharlie knew that the poor girl would need all her strength, for what\nshe might have to undergo; and at once resolved that, for the present\nat least, it would be better that she should be in ignorance of the\nfate of her father. He therefore said that, for the present, Mr.\nHaines was unable to come, and had asked him to look after her.\n\nIt was not until five o'clock that the nabob entered the fort. He was\nfurious at hearing that only five lacs of rupees had been found in the\ntreasury, as he had expected to become possessed of a vastly larger\nsum. Kissendas, the first cause of the present calamities, was brought\nbefore him; but the capricious tyrant, contrary to expectation,\nreceived him courteously, and told him he might return to Dacca. The\nwhole of the Eurasians, or half castes, and natives found in the fort\nwere also allowed to return to their homes.\n\nMr. Holwell was then sent for, and after the nabob had expressed his\nresentment at the small amount found in the treasury, he was\ndismissed, the nabob assuring him of his protection. Mr. Holwell\nreturned to his English companions, who, one hundred and forty-six in\nnumber, including the two ladies, were drawn up under the veranda in\nfront of the prison. The nabob then returned to his camp.\n\nSome native officers went in search of some building where the\nprisoners could be confined, but every room in the fort had already\nbeen taken possession of, by the nabob's soldiers and officers. At\neight o'clock, they returned with the news that they could find no\nplace vacant, and the officer in command at once ordered the prisoners\ninto a small room, used as a guardroom for insubordinate soldiers,\neighteen feet square.\n\nIn vain they protested that it was impossible the room could contain\nthem, in vain implored the officer to allow some of them to be\nconfined in an adjoining cell. The wretch was deaf to their\nentreaties. He ordered his soldiers to charge the prisoners, and\nthese, with blows of the butt ends of the muskets, and prods of the\nbayonets, were driven into the narrow cell.\n\nTim Kelly had kept close to his master, during the preceding days. The\nwhole of the four native officers, who had so distinguished themselves\nunder Charlie, were killed during the siege. Hossein, who would fain\nhave shared his master's fortunes, was forcibly torn from him, when\nthe English prisoners were separated from the natives.\n\nThe day had been unusually hot. The night was close and sultry, and\nthe arched veranda, outside, further hindered the circulation of the\nair. This was still heavy with the fumes of powder, creating an\nintolerable thirst. Scarcely were the prisoners driven into their\nnarrow cell where, even standing wedged closely together, there was\nbarely room for them, than cries for water were raised.\n\n\"Tim, my boy,\" Charlie said to his companion, \"we may say goodbye to\neach other now, for I doubt if one will be alive, when the door is\nopened in the morning.\"\n\nOn entering Charlie, always keeping Ada Haines by his side, had taken\nhis place against the wall farthest from the window, which was closed\nwith iron bars.\n\n\"I think, yer honor,\" Tim said, \"that if we could get nearer to the\nwindow, we might breathe a little more easily.\"\n\n\"Ay, Tim; but there will be a fight for life round that window, before\nlong. You and I might hold our own, if we could get there, though it\nwould be no easy matter where all are struggling for life; but this\npoor little girl would be crushed to death. Besides, I believe that\nwhat chance there is, faint as it may be, is greater for us here than\nthere. The rush towards the window, which is beginning already, as you\nsee, will grow greater and greater; and the more men struggle and\nstrive, the more air they require.\n\n\"Let us remain where we are. Strip off your coat and waistcoat, and\nbreathe as quietly and easily as you can. Every hour the crowd will\nthin, and we may yet hold on till morning.\"\n\nThis conversation had been held in a low voice. Charlie then turned to\nthe girl.\n\n\"How are you feeling, Ada?\" he asked cheerfully. \"It's hot, isn't it!\"\n\n\"It is dreadful,\" the girl panted, \"and I seem choking from want of\nair; and oh, Captain Marryat, I am so thirsty!\"\n\n\"It is hot, my dear, terribly hot, but we must make the best of it;\nand I hope, in a few days, you will join your mamma on board ship.\nThat will be pleasant, won't it?\"\n\n\"Where is papa?\" the girl wailed.\n\n\"I don't know where he is now, my child. At any rate, we must feel\nvery glad that he's not shut up here, with us. Now take your bonnet\noff, and your shawl, and undo the hooks of your dress, and loosen\neverything you can. We must be as quiet and cheerful as possible. I'm\nafraid, Ada, we have a bad time before us tonight. But try to keep\ncheerful and quiet; and above all, dear, pray God to give you strength\nto carry you through it, and to restore you safe to your mamma, in a\nfew days.\"\n\nAs time went on, the scene in the dungeon became terrible. Shouts,\noaths, cries of all kinds, rose in the air. Round the window men\nfought like wild beasts, tearing each other down, or clinging to the\nbars for dear life, for a breath of the air without. Panting,\nstruggling, crying, men sank exhausted upon the floor, and the last\nremnants of life were trodden out of them, by those who surged forward\nto get near the window.\n\nIn vain, Mr. Holwell implored them to keep quiet, for their own sakes.\nHis voice was lost in the terrible din. Men, a few hours ago rich and\nrespected merchants, now fought like maddened beasts for a breath of\nfresh air. In vain, those at the window screamed to the guards\nwithout, imploring them to bring water. Their prayers and entreaties\nwere replied to only with brutal scoffs.\n\nSeveral times Charlie and Tim, standing together against the wall\nbehind, where there was now room to move, lifted Ada between them, and\nsat her on their shoulders in order that, raised above the crowd, she\nmight breathe more freely. Each time, after sitting there for a while,\nthe poor girl begged to come down again; the sight of the terrible\nstruggle, ever going on at the window, being too much for her; and\nwhen released, leaning against Charlie, supported by his arm, with her\nhead against his shoulder, and her hands over her ears to shut out the\ndreadful sounds which filled the cell.\n\nHour passed after hour. There was more room now, for already half the\ninmates of the place had succumbed. The noises, too, had lessened, for\nno longer could the parched lips and throats utter articulate sounds.\nCharlie and Tim, strong men as they were, leaned utterly exhausted\nagainst the wall, bathed in perspiration, gasping for air.\n\n\"Half the night must be gone, Tim,\" Charlie said, \"and I think, with\nGod's help, we shall live through it. The numbers are lessening fast,\nand every one who goes leaves more air for the rest of us.\n\n\"Cheer up, Ada dear, 'twill not be very long till morning.\"\n\n\"I think I shall die soon,\" the girl gasped. \"I shall never see papa\nor mamma again. You have been very kind, Captain Marryat, but it is no\nuse.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is of use,\" Charlie said cheerfully. \"I don't mean to let\nyou die at all, but to hand you over to mamma, safe and sound. There,\nlay your head against me, dear, and say your prayers, and try and go\noff to sleep.\"\n\nPresently, however, Ada's figure drooped more and more, until her\nwhole weight leaned upon Charlie's arm.\n\n\"She has fainted, Tim,\" he said. \"Help me to raise her well in my\narms, and lay her head on my shoulder. That's right. Now, you'll find\nher shawl somewhere under my feet; hold it up, and make a fan of it.\nNow, try to send some air into her face.\"\n\nBy this time, not more than fifty out of the hundred and forty-six who\nentered the cell were alive. Suddenly a scream of joy, from those near\nthe window, proclaimed that a native was approaching with some water.\nThe struggle at the window was fiercer than ever. The bowl was too\nwide to pass through the bars, and the water was being spilt in vain;\neach man who strove to get his face far enough through to touch the\nbowl being torn back, by his eager comrades behind.\n\n\"Tim,\" Charlie said, \"you are now much stronger than most of them.\nThey are faint from the struggles. Make a charge to the window. Take\nthat little shawl and dip it into the bowl, or whatever they have\nthere, and then fight your way back with it.\"\n\n\"I will do it, yer honor,\" said Tim, and he rushed into the struggling\ngroup.\n\nWeak as he was from exhaustion and thirst, he was as a giant to most\nof the poor wretches, who had been struggling and crying all night;\nand, in spite of their cries and curses, he broke through them and\nforced his way to the window.\n\nThe man with the bowl was on the point of turning away, the water\nbeing spilt in the vain attempts of those within to obtain it. By the\nlight of the fire which the guard had lit without, Tim saw his face.\n\n\"Hossein,\" he exclaimed, \"more water, for God's sake! The master's\nalive yet.\"\n\nHossein at once withdrew, but soon again approached with the bowl. The\nofficer in charge angrily ordered him to draw back.\n\n\"Let the infidel dogs howl,\" he said. \"They shall have no more.\"\n\nRegardless of the order, Hossein ran to the window, and Tim thrust the\nshawl into the water at the moment when the officer, rushing forward,\nstruck Hossein to the ground: a cry of anguish rising from the\nprisoners, as they saw the water dashed from their lips.\n\nTim made his way back to the side of his master. Had those who still\nremained alive been aware of the supply of water which he carried, in\nthe shawl, they would have torn it from him; but none save those just\nat the window had noticed the act, and inside it was still entirely\ndark.\n\n\"Thank God, yer honor, here it is,\" Tim said; \"and who should have\nbrought it, but Hossein. Shure, yer honor, we both owe our lives to\nhim this time, for I'm sure I should have been choked by thirst,\nbefore morning.\"\n\nAda was now lowered to the ground and, forcing her teeth asunder, a\ncorner of the folded shawl was placed between her lips, and the water\nallowed to trickle down. With a gasping sigh, she presently recovered.\n\n\"That is delicious,\" she murmured. \"That is delicious.\"\n\nRaising her to her feet, Charlie and Tim both sucked the dripping\nshawl, until the first agonies of thirst were relieved. Then, tearing\noff a portion, in case Ada should again require it, Charlie passed the\nshawl to Mr. Holwell; who, after sucking it for a moment, again passed\nit on to several standing round; and in this way many of those, who\nwould otherwise have succumbed, were enabled to hold on until morning.\n\nPresently the first dawn of daylight appeared, giving fresh hopes to\nthe few survivors. There were now only some six or eight standing by\nthe window, and a few standing or leaning against the walls around.\nThe room itself was heaped high with the dead.\n\nIt was not until two hours later that the doors were opened, and the\nguard entered; and it was found that, of the hundred and forty-six\nEnglishmen inclosed there the night before, but twenty-three still\nbreathed. Of these, very few retained strength to stagger out through\nthe door. The rest were carried out, and laid in the veranda.\n\nWhen the nabob came into the fort in the morning, he ordered Mr.\nHolwell to be brought before him. He was unable to walk, but was\ncarried to his presence. The brutal nabob expressed no regret for what\nhad happened, but loaded him with abuse, on account of the paucity of\nthe treasure, and ordered him to be placed in confinement. The other\nprisoners were also confined in a cell. Ada, the only English female\nwho had survived the siege, was torn, weeping, from Charlie's arms,\nand conveyed to the zenana, or ladies' apartments, of one of the\nnabob's generals.\n\nA few days later, the English captives were all conveyed to\nMoorshedabad, where the rajah also returned, after having extorted\nlarge sums from the French and Dutch, and confiscated the whole of the\nproperty of the English in Bengal.\n\nThe prospect was a gloomy one for the captives. That the English\nwould, in time, return and extort a heavy reckoning from the nabob,\nthey did not doubt for a moment. But nothing was more likely than\nthat, at the news of the first disaster which befell his troops, the\nnabob would order his captives to be put to death.\n\nUpon the march up the country Charlie had, by his cheerfulness and\ngood temper, gained the goodwill of the officer commanding the guard;\nand upon arriving at their destination, he recommended him so strongly\nto the commander of the prison that the latter, instead of placing him\nin the apartment allotted to the remainder of the prisoners, assigned\na separate room to him; permitting Tim, at his request, to occupy it\nwith him. It was a room of fair size, in a tower on one of the angles\nof the walls. It had bars, but these did not prevent those behind them\nlooking out at the country which stretched around. The governor of the\nprison, finding that Charlie spoke the language fluently, often came\nup to sit with him, conversing with him on the affairs of that unknown\ncountry, England.\n\nAltogether, they were fairly treated. Their food was plentiful and,\nbeyond their captivity, they had little to complain of. Over and over\nagain, they talked about the possibilities of effecting an escape;\nbut, on entering the prison, they had noticed how good was the watch,\nhow many and strong the doors through which they had passed. They had\nmeditated upon making a rope and escaping from the window; but they\nslept on the divan, each with a rug to cover them; and these, torn\ninto strips and twisted, would not reach a quarter of the way from\ntheir window to the ground; and there was no other material of which a\nrope could possibly have been formed.\n\n\"Our only hope,\" Charlie said one day, \"is in Hossein. I am sure he\nwill follow us to the death; and if he did but know where we are\nconfined, he would not, I am certain, rest day or night, till he had\nopened a communication with us.\n\n\"See, Tim, there is my regimental cap, with its gold lace. Let us\nfasten it outside the bars, with a thread from that rug. Of course, we\nmust remove it when we hear anyone coming.\"\n\nThis was speedily done and, for the next few days, one or other\nremained constantly at the window.\n\n\"Mr. Charles!\" Tim exclaimed in great excitement, one day; \"there is a\nman I've been watching, for the last half hour. He seems to be picking\nup sticks, but all the while he keeps getting nearer and nearer, and\ntwo or three times it seems to me that he has looked up in this\ndirection.\"\n\nCharlie joined Tim at the window.\n\n\"Yes, Tim, you are right. That's Hossein, I'm pretty sure.\"\n\nThe man had now approached within two or three hundred yards of the\ncorner of the wall. He was apparently collecting pieces of dried\nbrushwood, for firing. Presently, he glanced in the direction of the\nwindow. Charlie thrust his arm through the bar, and waved his hand.\nThe man threw up his arm with a gesture which, to a casual observer,\nwould have appeared accidental; but which the watchers had no doubt,\nwhatever, was intended for them. He was still too far off from them to\nbe able to distinguish his features, but they had not the least doubt\nthat it was Hossein.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19. A Daring Escape.\n\n\n\"And what's to be done next, Mister Charles? That's Hossein, sure\nenough, but it don't bring us much nearer to getting out.\"\n\n\"The first thing is to communicate with him in some way, Tim.\"\n\n\"If he'd come up to the side of the moat, yer honor might spake to\nhim.\"\n\n\"That would never do, Tim. There are sure to be sentries on the walls\nof the prison. We must trust to him. He can see the sentries, and will\nknow best what he can do.\"\n\nIt was evident that Hossein did not intend doing anything, at present;\nfor, still stooping and gathering brushwood, he gradually withdrew\nfarther and farther from the wall. Then they saw him make his sticks\ninto a bundle, put them on his shoulder, and walk away. During the\nrest of the day, they saw no more of Hossein.\n\n\"I will write,\" Charlie said, \"--fortunately I have a pencil--telling\nhim that we can lower a light string down to the moat, if he can\nmanage to get underneath with a cord which we can hoist up, and that\nhe must have two disguises in readiness.\"\n\n\"I don't think Hossein can read,\" Tim said, \"any more than I can,\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I daresay not, Tim, but he will probably have friends in the town.\nThere are men who were employed in the English factory at Kossimbazar,\nhard by. These will be out of employment, and will regret the\nexpulsion of the English. We can trust Hossein. At any rate, I will\nget it ready.\n\n\"Now the first thing we have to do is to loosen one of these bars. I\nwish we had thought of doing it before. However, the stonework is\npretty rotten, and we shall have no difficulty about that. The first\nthing is to get a tool of some sort.\"\n\nThey looked round the room, and for some time saw nothing which could\nin any way serve. The walls, floor, and wide bench running round, upon\nwhich the cushions which served as their beds were laid, were all\nstone. There was no other furniture, of any kind.\n\n\"Divil a bit of iron do I see in the place, Mister Charles,\" Tim said.\n\"They don't even give us a knife for dinner, but stew all their meats\ninto a smash.\"\n\n\"There is something, Tim,\" Charlie said, looking at the door. \"Look at\nthose long hinges.\"\n\nThe hinges were of ornamented ironwork, extending half across the\ndoor. Upon one of the scrolls of this ironwork they set to work.\nChipping a small piece of stone off an angle of the wall, outside the\nwindow; with great difficulty they thrust this under the end of the\nscroll, as a wedge. Another piece, slightly larger, was then pushed\nunder it. The gain was almost imperceptible, but at last the piece of\niron was raised from the woodwork sufficiently to allow them to get a\nhold of it, with their thumbs. Then, little by little, they bent it\nupward; until at last they could obtain a firm hold of it.\n\nThe rest was comparatively easy. The iron was tough and strong but, by\nbending it up and down, they succeeded at last in breaking it off. It\nwas the lower hinge of the door, upon which they had operated, as the\nloss of a piece of iron there would be less likely to catch the eye of\nanyone coming in. They collected some dust from the corner of the\nroom, moistened it, and rubbed it on to the wood so as to take away\nits freshness of appearance; and they then set to work with the piece\nof iron, which was of a curved shape, about three inches long, an inch\nwide, and an eighth of an inch thick.\n\nTaking it by turns, they ground away the stone round the bottom of one\nof the bars. For the first inch, the stone yielded readily to the\niron; but below that it became harder, and their progress was slow.\nThey filled the hole which they had made with water, to soften the\nstone, and worked steadily away till night; when, to their great joy,\nthey found that they had reached the bottom of the bar. They then\nenlarged the hole inwards, in order that the bar might be pulled back.\nFortunately, it was much decayed by age; and they had no doubt that,\nby exerting all their strength, together they could bend it\nsufficiently to enable them to get through.\n\nAt the hour when their dinner was brought they had ceased their work,\nfilled up the hole with dust collected from the floor, put some dust\nof the stone over it, and smoothed it down, so that it would not have\nbeen noticed by anyone casually looking from the window.\n\nIt was late at night before they finished their work. Their hands were\nsore and bleeding, and they were completely worn out with fatigue.\nThey had saved, from their dinner, a good-sized piece of bread. They\nfolded up into a small compass the leaf from his pocketbook, upon\nwhich Charlie had written in Hindostanee his letter to Hossein, and\nthrust this into the centre of the piece of bread. Then Charlie told\nTim to lie down and rest for three hours, while he kept watch; as they\nmust take it in turns, all night, to listen in case Hossein should\ncome outside. The lamp was kept burning.\n\nJust as Charlie's watch was over, he thought he heard a very faint\nsplash in the water below. Two or three minutes later, he again\nthought he heard the sound. He peered out of the window anxiously, but\nthe night was dark, and he could see nothing. Listening intently, it\nseemed to him, several times, that he heard the same faint sound.\n\nPresently something whizzed by him, and looking round, to his delight\nhe saw a small arrow, with a piece of very thin string attached. The\narrow was made of very light wood. Round the iron point was a thick\nwrapping of cotton, which would entirely deaden its sound, as it\nstruck a wall. It was soaked in water, and Charlie had no doubt that\nthe sound he heard was caused by its fall into the moat, after\nineffectual trials to shoot through the window.\n\nRound the centre of the arrow a piece of greased silk was wrapped.\nCharlie took this off, and found beneath it a piece of paper, on which\nwas written in Hindostanee:\n\n\"If you have a bar loosed, pull the string and haul up a rope. If not,\nthrow the arrow down. I will come again, tomorrow night.\"\n\nTim had by this time joined Charlie, and they speedily began to pull\nin the string. Presently a thicker string came up into their hands.\nThey continued to pull, and soon the end of a stout rope, in which\nknots were tied every two feet, came up to them. They fastened this to\none of the bars, and then took hold of that which they had loosened;\nand, putting their feet against the wall, exerted themselves to the\nutmost. The iron was tougher than they had expected, but they were\nstriving for liberty and, with desperate exertions, they bent it\ninwards until, at last, there was room enough for them to creep\nthrough.\n\n\"Can you swim, Tim?\"\n\n\"Not a stroke, yer honor. Shure you should know that, when you fished\nme out of the water.\"\n\n\"Very well, Tim. As I kept you up then, 'twill be easy enough for me,\nnow, to take you across the moat. I will go first, and when I get into\nthe water, will keep hold of the rope till you come down. Take off\nyour boots, for they would be heard scraping against the wall. Be sure\nyou make as little noise as possible, and lower yourself quietly into\nthe water.\"\n\nCharlie then removed his own boots, squeezed himself through the bars\nand, grasping the rope tightly, began to descend. He found the knots\nof immense assistance, for had it not been for them, unaccustomed as\nhe was to the work, he would have been unable to prevent himself from\nsliding down too rapidly. The window was fully sixty feet above the\nmoat, and he was very thankful when, at last, he felt the water touch\nhis feet. Lowering himself quietly into it, he shook the rope, to let\nTim know that he could begin his descent.\n\nBefore Tim was halfway down, Charlie could hear his hard breathing,\nand muttered ejaculations to himself:\n\n\"Shure I'll never get to the bottom at all, my arms are fairly\nbreaking. I shall squash Mr. Charles, if I fall on him.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Tim,\" Charlie said in a loud whisper.\n\nTim was silent, but the panting and puffing increased, and Charlie\nswam a stroke or two away, expecting every moment that Tim would fall.\nThe Irishman, however, held on; but let himself into the water with a\nsplash, which aroused the attention of the sentry above, who instantly\nchallenged.\n\nTim and Charlie remained perfectly quiet. Again the sentry challenged.\nThen there was a long silence. The sentry probably was unwilling to\nrouse the place by a false alarm, and the splash might have been\ncaused by the fall of a piece of decayed stone from the face of the\nwall.\n\n\"Tim, you clumsy fellow,\" whispered Charlie, \"you nearly spoiled all.\"\n\n\"Shure, yer honor, I was kilt entirely, and my arms were pulled out of\nmy sockets. Holy Mother, who'd have thought 'twould be so difficult to\ncome down a rope! The sailors are great men, entirely.\"\n\n\"Now, Tim, lie quiet. I will turn you on your back, and swim across\nwith you.\"\n\nThe moat was some twenty yards wide. Charlie swam across, towing Tim\nafter him, and taking the greatest pains to avoid making the slightest\nsplash. The opposite side was of stonework, and rose six feet above\nthe water. As soon as they touched the wall, a stout rope was lowered\nto them.\n\n\"Now, Tim, you climb up first.\"\n\n\"Is it climb up, yer honor? I couldn't do it, if it was to save my\nsowl. My arms are gone altogether, and I'm as weak as a child.\n\n\"You go, Mister Charles. I'll hould on by the rope till morning. They\ncan but shoot me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Tim! Here, I will fasten the rope round your body. Then I\nwill climb up, and we will pull you up after me.\"\n\nIn another minute, Charlie stood on the bank, and grasped the hand of\nhis faithful follower. Hossein threw himself on his knees, and pressed\nhis master to him. Then he rose and, at a word from Charlie, they\nhauled Tim to the top. The rope was taken off him and, noiselessly,\nthey made their way across the country. Not a word was spoken, till\nthey were at a considerable distance from the fort.\n\n\"Where are you taking us, Hossein?\" Charlie asked, at last.\n\n\"I have two peasants' dresses, in a deserted cottage a quarter of a\nmile away.\"\n\nNot another word was spoken, until they reached the hut, which stood\nat the end of a small village. When they had entered this, Charlie\nfirst thanked, in the warmest terms, his follower for having rescued\nthem.\n\n\"My life is my lord's,\" Hossein answered simply. \"He gave it me. It is\nhis again, whenever it is useful to him.\"\n\n\"No, Hossein, the balance is all on your side, now. You saved my life\nthat night at Ambur. You saved it that night at Calcutta, for, without\nthe water you brought us, I question whether we could have lived till\nmorning. Now you have procured our freedom. The debt is all on my side\nnow, my friend.\"\n\n\"Hossein is glad that his lord is content,\" the Mohammedan murmured.\n\"Now, what will my lord do?\"\n\n\"Have you any place in the town to which we could go, Hossein?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sahib. I hired a little house. I was dressed as a trader. I have\nbeen here for two months, but I could not find where you were\nconfined, although I have tried all means, until I saw your cap.\"\n\n\"It was foolish of me not to have thought of it before,\" Charlie said.\n\"Well, Hossein, for a little time we had better take refuge in your\nhouse. They will not think of searching in the city; and, as Calcutta\nis in their hands, there is nowhere we could go. Besides, I must\ndiscover, if possible, where Miss Haines is kept a prisoner; and\nrescue her, if it can be done.\"\n\n\"The white girl is in the zenana of Rajah Dulab Ram,\" Hossein replied.\n\n\"Where is the rajah's palace?\"\n\n\"He has one in the city, one at Ajervam, twenty miles from here. I do\nnot know at which she is lodged.\"\n\n\"We must find that out presently,\" Charlie said. \"It is something to\nknow she is in one of two houses.\n\n\"Now, about getting back into the town?\"\n\n\"I have thought of that,\" Hossein said. \"I have bought a quantity of\nplantains, and two large baskets. After the gates are opened, you will\ngo boldly in with the baskets on your heads. No questions are asked of\nthe country people who go in and out. I have some stain here, which\nwill darken your skins.\n\n\"I will go in first in my merchant's dress, which I have here. I will\nstop a little way inside the gate, and when I see you coming, will\nwalk on. Do you follow me, a little behind. My house is in a quiet\nstreet. When I reach the door, do you come up and offer to sell me\nplantains. If there are people about, I shall bargain with you until I\nsee that no one is noticing us. Then you can enter. If none are about,\nyou can follow me straight in.\"\n\nHossein now set about the disguises. A light was struck, and both Tim\nand Charlie were shaved, up to the line which the turban would cover.\nCharlie's whiskers, which were somewhat faint, as he was still under\ntwenty-one years old, gave but little trouble. Tim, however, grumbled\nat parting with his much more bushy appendages. The shaven part of the\nheads, necks, and faces were then rubbed with a dark fluid, as were\nthe arms and legs.\n\nThey were next wrapped in dark blue clothes, in peasant fashion, and\nturbans wound round their heads. Hossein then, examining them\ncritically, announced that they would pass muster anywhere.\n\n\"I feel mighty quare,\" Tim exclaimed; \"and it seems to me downright\nondacent, to be walking about with my naked legs.\"\n\nCharlie laughed.\n\n\"Why, Tim, you are accustomed to see thousands of men, every day, with\nnothing on but a loincloth.\"\n\n\"Yes, yer honor, but then they're hathens, and it seems natural for\nthem to do so; but for a dacent boy to go walking about in the\nstreets, with a thing on which covers no more than his shirt, is\nonnatural altogether. Mother of Moses, what a shindy there would be,\nin the streets of Cork, if I were to show myself in such a state!\"\n\nCharlie now lay down for a sleep till morning; while Tim, who had had\nthree hours' repose, settled himself for a comfortable chat with\nHossein, to whom sleep appeared altogether unnecessary.\n\nBetween Hossein and Tim there was a sort of brotherly attachment,\narising from their mutual love of their master. During the two years\nwhich Tim had spent apart from all Europeans, save Charlie, he had\ncontrived to pick up enough of the language to make himself fairly\nintelligible; and, since the day when Hossein had saved Charlie's life\nat Ambur, the warmest friendship had sprung up between the\ngood-humoured and warm-hearted Irishman, and the silent and devoted\nMohammedan.\n\nTim's friendship even extended so far as to induce a toleration of\nHossein's religion. He had come to the conclusion that a man who, at\nstated times in the day, would leave his employment, whatever it might\nbe, spread his carpet, and be for some minutes lost in prayer, could\nnot be altogether a hathen; especially when he learned, from Charlie,\nthat the Mohammedans, like ourselves, worship one God. For the sake of\nhis friend, then, he now generally excluded the Mohammedans from the\ngeneral designation of heathen, which he still applied to the Hindoos.\n\nHe learned from Hossein that the latter, having observed from a\ndistance the Europeans driven into the cell at Calcutta, perceived at\nonce how fatal the consequences would be. He had, an hour or two after\nthey were confined there, approached with some water, but the officer\non guard had refused to let him give it. He had then gone into the\nnative town, but being unable to find any fruit there, had walked out\nto the gardens, and had picked a large basketful. This he had brought\nas an offering to the officer, and the latter had then consented to\nhis giving one bowl of water to the prisoners, among whom, as he had\ntold him, was his master. For bringing a second bowl, contrary to his\norders, Hossein had, as Tim saw, been struck down; but had the\nsatisfaction of believing that his master, and Tim, had derived some\nbenefit from his effort.\n\nOn the following morning, to his delight, he saw them issue among the\nfew survivors from the dungeon; and had, when they were taken up the\ncountry, followed close behind them, arriving at the town on the same\nday as themselves. He had, ever since, been wandering round the\nprison. He had taken a house, so close to it that he could keep a\nwatch on all the windows facing the town; and had, day after day, kept\nhis eyes fixed upon these without success. He had, at last, found out\nfrom one of the soldiers that the white prisoners were confined on the\nother side of the prison; but until he saw Charlie's cap, he had been\nunable to discover the room in which they were confined.\n\nIn the morning, they started for the town. Groups of peasants were\nalready making their way towards the gate, with fruit and grain; and,\nkeeping near one of these parties, while sufficiently distant to\nprevent the chance of their being addressed, Charlie and Tim made\ntheir way to the gate; the latter suffering acutely, in his mind, from\nthe impropriety of his attire.\n\nNo questions were asked, as they passed the guard. They at once\nperceived Hossein, standing a little way off, and followed him through\nthe busy streets. They soon turned off into a quieter quarter, and\nstopped at a house, in a street in which scarcely anyone was stirring.\nHossein glanced round, as he opened the door, and beckoned to them to\nenter at once. This they did, and were glad, indeed, to set down the\nheavy baskets of plantains.\n\n\"My lord's room is upstairs,\" Hossein said, and led the way to a\ncomfortably furnished apartment. \"I think that you might stay here,\nfor months, unsuspected. A sweeper comes, every day, to do my rooms\ndownstairs. He believes the rest of the house to be untenanted, and\nyou must remain perfectly quiet, during the half hour he is here.\nOtherwise, no one enters the house but myself.\"\n\nHossein soon set to work, and prepared an excellent breakfast. Then he\nleft them, saying that he would now devote himself to finding out\nwhether the young white lady was in the town palace of the rajah. He\nreturned in the afternoon.\n\n\"She is here, Sahib,\" he said. \"I got into conversation with one of\nthe retainers of the rajah; and by giving him some wonderful bargains,\nin Delhi jewelry, succeeded in opening his lips. I dare not question\nhim too closely, but I am to meet him tomorrow, to show him some more\nsilver bracelets.\"\n\n\"It is fortunate, Hossein, that you have some money, for neither Tim\nnor I have a rupee.\"\n\n\"Thanks to the generosity of my lord,\" Hossein said, \"I am well\nsupplied.\"\n\nThe next day, Hossein discovered that the windows of the zenana were\nat the back of the palace, looking into the large garden.\n\n\"I hear, however,\" he said, \"that the ladies of the zenana are, next\nweek, going to the rajah's other palace. The ladies will, of course,\ntravel in palanquins; but upon the road I might get to talk with one\nof the waiting women, and might bribe her to pass a note into the\nhands of the white lady.\"\n\n\"I suppose they will have a guard with them, Hossein?\"\n\n\"Surely, a strong guard,\" Hossein answered.\n\nThe time passed, until the day came for the departure of the rajah's\nzenana. Charlie wrote a note, as follows:\n\n\"My dear Ada,\n\n\"I am free, and am on the lookout for an opportunity to rescue you.\nContrive to put a little bit of your handkerchief through the\nlatticework of the window of your room, as a signal to us which it is.\nOn the second night after your arrival, we will be under it with a\nladder. If others, as is probable, sleep in your room, lie down\nwithout undressing more than you can help. When they are asleep, get\nup and go to the window, and open the lattice. If any of them wake,\nsay you are hot and cannot sleep, and wait quietly till they are off\nagain. Then stretch out your arm, and we shall know you are ready.\nThen we will put up the ladder, and you must get out, and come to us\nas quickly as possible. Once with us, you will be safe.\"\n\nThis note was wrapped up very small, and put into a quill. As soon as\nthe gates were open, Hossein and his companions left the town, and\nproceeded as far as a grove, halfway between the town and the rajah's\ncountry palace.\n\n\"They are sure to stop here, for a rest,\" Hossein said. \"I will remain\nhere, and try to enter into conversation with one of them. It will be\nbetter for you to go on, for some distance, and then turn aside from\nthe road. When they have all passed, come back into the road again,\nand I will join you.\"\n\nAfter waiting two hours, Hossein saw two carts full of women\napproaching, and had no doubt that these were the servants of the\nzenana. As he had expected, the drivers halted their cattle in the\nshade of the trees; and the women, delighted to enjoy their liberty,\nalighted from the carts and scattered in the grove. Presently one of\nthem, a middle-aged woman, approached the spot where Hossein had\nseated himself.\n\nHossein drew out a large and beautiful silver bracelet, of Delhi\nworkmanship.\n\n\"Would you like to buy this?\" he asked.\n\n\"How should I buy it?\" she said. \"I am only a servant.\n\n\"It is very beautiful;\" and she looked at it, with longing eyes.\n\n\"I have two of them,\" he said, \"and they will both be yours, if you\nwill do me a service.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"They will be yours, if you will give this quill to the little white\ngirl, who is in the zenana.\"\n\nThe woman hesitated.\n\n\"It is dangerous,\" she said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Hossein replied. \"It only gives her news of a friend,\nwhom she thought was dead. It will cheer her heart, and will be a kind\naction. None can ever know it.\"\n\n\"Give them to me,\" the woman said, holding out her hand. \"I will do\nit.\"\n\n\"No,\" Hossein replied. \"I will give you one now, the other when I know\nthat the note is delivered. I shall be watching, tomorrow. If she\nplaces her handkerchief in her lattice, I shall know that she has got\nit. When she does this, I will bury the other bracelet, a few inches\nin the ground, just under that window. You can dig it up when you\nwill.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" the woman said. \"You can trust me. We all like the\nwhite girl. She is very gentle, but very sad. I would gladly give her\npleasure.\"\n\nHossein handed to her the bracelet, and the quill. She hid them in her\ndress, and sauntered away.\n\nHossein lay back, as if taking a sleep, and so remained until, half an\nhour later, he heard the shouts of the drivers to the women, to take\ntheir places in the carts. Then the sound of retreating wheels was\nheard.\n\nHossein was about to rise, when he heard the clatter of horses' hoofs.\nLooking round he saw eight elephants, each carrying a closed pavilion,\nmoving along the road, escorted by a troop of horsemen. In the\npavilions, as he knew, were the ladies of the rajah's zenana.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20. The Rescue Of The White Captive.\n\n\nAfter the cavalcade had passed, Hossein rose to his feet and followed\nthem, allowing them to go some distance ahead. Presently he was joined\nby Charlie and Tim, and the three walked quietly along the road, until\nwithin sight of the rajah's palace.\n\nIn front stood a great courtyard. Behind, also surrounded by a high\nwall, was the garden. As this was always devoted to the zenana, they\nhad little doubt that the rooms of the ladies were on this side; and,\ntwo hours later, they were delighted at seeing a small piece of white\nstuff, thrust through one of the lattices. The woman had been faithful\nto her trust. Ada had received the letter.\n\nThey then retired to a distance from the palace, and at once set to\nwork on the fabrication of a ladder. Hossein, followed by Charlie, who\nbetter enacted the part than Tim, went into a village and purchased\nfour long bamboo poles, saying he wanted them for the carrying of\nburdens. Charlie placed these on his shoulder, and followed Hossein.\n\nWhen they arrived at the grove they set to work, having brought with\nthem all the necessary materials. The bamboos were spliced together,\ntwo and two; and while Charlie and Tim set to, to bore holes in these,\nHossein chopped down a young tree and, cutting it into lengths,\nprepared the rungs.\n\nIt took them all that evening, and the greater part of the next day,\nbefore they had satisfactorily accomplished their work. They had,\nthen, a ladder thirty feet long, the height which they judged the\nwindow to be above the terrace below. It was strong, and at the same\ntime light.\n\nThey waited until darkness had completely fallen; and then, taking\ntheir ladder, went round to the back of the garden. They mounted the\nwall and, sitting on the top, dragged the ladder after them, and\nlowered it on the other side. It was of equal thickness the whole\nlength; and could, therefore, be used indifferently either way.\n\nThey waited patiently, until they saw the lights in the zenana windows\nextinguished. Then they crept quietly up, and placed the ladder under\nthe window at which the signal had been shown; and found that their\ncalculations were correct, and that it reached to a few inches below\nthe sill.\n\nHalf an hour later, the lattice above opened. They heard a murmur of\nvoices, and then all was quiet again. After a few minutes, Charlie\nclimbed noiselessly up the ladder and, just as he reached the top, an\narm was stretched out above him; and, a moment afterwards, Ada's face\nappeared.\n\n\"I am here, dear,\" he said, in a whisper. \"Lean out, and I will take\nyou.\"\n\nThe girl stretched out over the window. Charlie took her in his arms,\nand lifted her lightly out, and then slowly descended the ladder. No\nsooner did he touch the ground than they hurried away; Ada sobbing,\nwith excitement and pleasure, on Charlie's shoulder; Tim and Hossein\nbearing the ladder; Hossein having already carried out his promise of\nconcealing the second bracelet under the window.\n\nIn a few minutes they had safely surmounted the wall, and hurried\nacross the country, with all speed. Before leaving the town, Hossein\nhad purchased a cart with two bullocks; and had hired a man who was\nrecommended to him, by one of his co-religionists there, as one upon\nwhose fidelity he could rely. This cart was awaiting them at a grove.\n\nPaying them the amount stipulated, Hossein took the ox goad and\nstarted the bullocks, Tim walking beside him, while Charlie and Ada\ntook their places in the cart. They were sure that a hot pursuit would\nbe set up. The rage of the nabob at the escape of Charlie and his\nservant had been extreme, and the whole country had been scoured by\nparties of horsemen; and they were sure that the rajah would use every\npossible means to discover Ada, before he ventured to report to the\nnabob that the prisoner committed to his charge had escaped.\n\n\"Of course, I can't see you very well,\" Ada said, \"but I should not\nhave known you, in the least.\"\n\n\"No, I am got up like a peasant,\" Charlie answered. \"We shall have to\ndress you so, before morning. We have got things here for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, how delighted I was,\" Ada exclaimed, \"when I got your note! I\nfound it so difficult to keep on looking sad and hopeless, when I\ncould have sung for joy. I had been so miserable. There seemed no\nhope, and they said, some day, I should be sent to the nabob's\nzenana--wretches! How poor mamma will be grieving for me, and papa!--\n\n\"Ah! Captain Marryat, he is dead, is he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" Charlie said gently. \"He was killed by my side, that\nafternoon. With his last breath, he asked me to take care of you.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" Ada said, crying quietly. \"I did not think of it at\nthe time. Everything was so strange, and so dreadful, that I scarcely\nthought at all. But afterwards, on the way here, when I turned it all\nover, it seemed to me that it must be so. He did not come to me, all\nthat afternoon. He was not shut up with us in that dreadful place, and\neveryone else was there. So it seemed to me that he must have been\nkilled, but that you did not like to tell me.\"\n\n\"It was better for him, dear, than to have died in that terrible cell.\nThank God your mamma is safe, and some day you will join her again.\n\n\"We have news that the English are coming up to attack Calcutta. A\nparty are already in the Hoogly; and the nabob is going to start, in a\nfew days, to his army there. I hope, in a very very short time, you\nwill be safe among your friends.\"\n\nAfter travelling for several hours, they stopped. Charlie gave Ada\nsome native clothes and ornaments, and told her to stain her face,\narms, and legs, to put on the bangles and bracelets, and then to\nrejoin them. Half an hour later, Ada took her seat in the cart, this\ntime transformed into a Hindoo girl, and the party again proceeded.\n\nThey felt sure that Ada's flight would not be discovered until\ndaybreak. It would be some little time before horsemen could be sent\noff in all directions, in pursuit; and they could not be overtaken\nuntil between eleven and twelve.\n\nThe waggon was filled with grain, on the top of which Charlie and Ada\nwere seated. When daylight came, Charlie alighted and walked by the\ncart. Unquestioned, they passed through several villages.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, Hossein pointed to a large grove, at some little\ndistance from the road.\n\n\"Go in there,\" he said, \"and stay till nightfall. Do you then come\nout, and follow me. I shall go into the next village, and remain there\ntill after dark. I shall then start, and wait for you half a mile\nbeyond the village.\"\n\nAn hour after the waggon had disappeared from sight, the party in the\ngrove saw ten or twelve horsemen galloping rapidly along the road. An\nhour passed, and the same party returned, at an equal speed. They saw\nno more of them and, after it became dark, they continued their way;\npassed through the village, which was three miles ahead; and found\nHossein waiting, a short distance beyond. Ada climbed into the cart,\nand they again went forward.\n\n\"Did you put the rajah's men on the wrong track, Hossein? We guessed\nthat you had done so, when we saw them going back.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hossein said. \"I had unyoked the bullocks, and had lain down in\nthe caravanserai, when they arrived. They came in, and their leader\nasked who I was. I said that I was taking down a load of grain, for\nthe use of the army at Calcutta. He asked where were the two men and\nthe woman who were with me. I replied that I knew nothing of them. I\nhad overtaken them on the road, and they had asked leave for the woman\nto ride in the cart. They said they were going to visit their mother,\nwho was sick.\n\n\"He asked if I was sure they were natives, and I counterfeited\nsurprise, and said that certainly they were; for which lie Allah will,\nI trust, be merciful, since it was told to an enemy. I said that they\nhad left me, just when we had passed the last village; and had turned\noff by the road to the right, saying they had many miles to go.\n\n\"They talked together and decided that, as you were the only people\nwho had been seen along the road, they must follow and find you; and\nso started at once, and I daresay they're searching for you now, miles\naway.\"\n\nTheir journey continued without any adventure, until within a few\nmiles of Calcutta. Hossein then advised them to take up their abode in\na ruined mud hut, at a distance from the road. He had bought, at the\nlast village, a supply of provisions, sufficient to last them for some\ndays.\n\n\"I shall now,\" he said, \"go into the town, sell my grain, bullocks,\nand cart, and find out where the soldiers are.\"\n\nAs soon as the news of the nabob's advance against Calcutta reached\nMadras, Mr. Pigot, who was now governor there, despatched a force of\ntwo hundred and thirty men, under the orders of Major Kilpatrick. The\nparty reached Falta, on the Hoogly, on the 2nd of August, and there\nheard of the capture of Calcutta. By detachments, who came down from\nsome of the Company's minor posts, the force was increased to nearly\nfour hundred. But sickness broke out among them and, finding himself\nunable to advance against so powerful an army as that of the nabob,\nMajor Kilpatrick sent to Madras for further assistance.\n\nWhen the news reached that place, Clive had recently arrived with a\nstrong force, which was destined to operate against the French at\nHyderabad. The news, however, of the catastrophe at Calcutta at once\naltered the destination of the force; and, on the 16th of October, the\nexpedition sailed for Calcutta. The force consisted of two hundred and\nfifty men of the 39th Foot, the first regiment of the regular English\narmy which had been sent out to India; five hundred and seventy men of\nthe Madras European force; eighty artillerymen; and twelve hundred\nSepoys.\n\nOf the nine hundred Europeans, only six hundred arrived at that time\nat the mouth of the Hoogly, the largest ship, the Cumberland, with\nthree hundred men on board, having grounded on the way. The remainder\nof the fleet, consisting of three ships of war, five transports, and a\nfire ship, reached Falta between the 11th and 20th of December.\n\nHossein had returned from Calcutta, with the news that the party\ncommanded by Major Kilpatrick had been, for some weeks, at Falta; and\nthe party at once set off towards that place, which was but forty\nmiles distant. Travelling by night, and sleeping by day in the woods,\nthey reached Falta without difficulty; and, learning that the force\nwas still on board ship, they took possession of a boat, moored by the\nbank some miles higher up, and rowed down.\n\nGreat was their happiness, indeed, at finding themselves once more\namong friends. Here were assembled many of the ships which had been at\nCalcutta, at the time it was taken; and, to Ada's delight, she learned\nthat her mother was on board one of these. They were soon rowed there,\nin a boat from the ship which they had first boarded; and Ada, on\ngaining the deck, saw her mother sitting among some other ladies,\nfugitives like herself.\n\nWith a scream of joy she rushed forward, and with a cry of, \"Mamma,\nMamma!\" threw herself into her mother's arms.\n\nIt was a moment or two before Mrs. Haines could realize that this\ndark-skinned Hindoo girl was her child, and then her joy equalled that\nof her daughter. It was some time before any coherent conversation\ncould take place; and then Ada, running back to Charlie, drew him\nforward to her mother; and presented him to her as her preserver, the\nCaptain Marryat who had stayed with them at Calcutta.\n\nMrs. Haines' gratitude was extreme, and Charlie was soon surrounded,\nand congratulated, by the officers on board, to many of whom,\nbelonging as they did to the Madras army, he was well known. Foremost\namong them, and loudest in his expressions of delight, was his friend\nPeters.\n\n\"You know, Charlie, I suppose,\" he said presently, \"that you are a\nmajor now?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" Charlie said. \"How is that?\"\n\n\"When the directors at home received the report of Commodore James,\nthat the fort of Suwarndrug had been captured entirely through you,\nthey at once sent out your appointment as major.\n\n\"You are lucky, old fellow. Here are you a major, while I'm a\nlieutenant, still. However, don't think I'm jealous, for I'm not a\nbit, and you thoroughly deserve all, and more than you've got.\"\n\n\"And this is Tim,\" Charlie said. \"He has shared all my adventures with\nme.\"\n\nTim was standing disconsolately by the bulwark, shifting uneasily from\nfoot to foot, with the feeling of the extreme shortness of his\ngarments stronger upon him than ever.\n\nPeters seized him heartily by the hand.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Tim, very glad. And so you've been with Major\nMarryat, ever since?\"\n\n\"For the Lord's sake, Mr. Peters,\" Tim said, in an earnest whisper,\n\"git me a pair of trousers. I'm that ashamed of myself, in the\npresence of the ladies, that I'm like to drop.\"\n\n\"Come along below, Tim. Come along, Charlie. There are lots of poor\nfellows have gone down, and uniforms are plentiful. We'll soon rig you\nout again.\"\n\n\"There is one more introduction, Peters. This is my man, Hossein. He\ncalls himself my servant. I call him my friend. He has saved my life\ntwice, and has been of inestimable service. Had it not been for him, I\nshould still be in prison at Moorshedabad.\"\n\nPeters said a few hearty words to Hossein, and they then went below;\nreturning on deck in half an hour, Charlie in the undress uniform of\nan officer, Tim in that of a private in the Madras infantry.\n\nMrs. Haines and Ada had gone below, where they could chat,\nunrestrained by the presence of others; and where an attempt could be\nmade to restore Ada to her former appearance. Mrs. Haines had heard of\nher husband's death, on the day after the capture of Calcutta, Mr.\nHolwell having been permitted to send on board the ships a list of\nthose who had fallen. She had learned that Ada had survived the\nterrible night in the dungeon, and that she had been sent up country,\na captive. She almost despaired of ever hearing of her again, but had\nresolved to wait to see the issue of the approaching campaign.\n\nNow that Ada was restored to her, she determined to leave for England;\nin a vessel which was to sail, in the course of a week, with a large\nnumber of fugitives. Mr. Haines was a very wealthy man, and had\nintended retiring, altogether, in the course of a few months; and she\nwould, therefore, be in the enjoyment of an ample fortune in England.\n\nAmong those on board the ships at Falta was Mr. Drake, who at once,\nupon hearing of Charlie's arrival, ordered him to be arrested. Major\nKilpatrick, however, firmly refused to allow the order to be carried\nout, saying that, as Charlie was under his orders as an officer in the\nMadras army, Mr. Drake had no control or authority over him. He could,\nhowever, upon Clive's arrival, lay the case before him.\n\nA week later, Mrs. Haines and Ada sailed for England, the latter\nweeping bitterly at parting from Charlie, who promised them that, when\nhe came home to England on leave, he would pay them a visit. He gave\nthem his mother's address; and Mrs. Haines promised to call upon her,\nas soon as she reached England, and give her full news of him; adding\nthat she hoped that his sisters, the youngest of whom was little older\nthan Ada, would be great friends with her.\n\nVery slowly and wearily the time passed at Falta. The mists from the\nriver were deadly, and of the two hundred and thirty men whom\nKilpatrick brought with him from Madras, in July, only about thirty\nremained alive; and of these, but ten were fit for duty when Clive, at\nlast, arrived.\n\nThe fleet left Falta on the 27th of December, and anchored off Moiapur\non the following day. The fort of Baj-baj, near this place, was the\nfirst object of attack; and it was arranged that, while Admiral Watson\nshould bombard with the fleet, Clive should attack it on the land\nside.\n\nClive, who now held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army, had\nmanifested great pleasure at again meeting the young officer who had\nserved under him at Arcot; and who had, in his absence, obtained a\nfame scarcely inferior to his own, by the defence of Ambur and the\ncapture of Suwarndrug. A few hours after Clive's arrival, Mr. Drake\nhad made a formal complaint of the assault which Charlie had\ncommitted; but after hearing, from Charlie, an account of the\ncircumstances, Clive sent a contemptuous message to Mr. Drake, to the\neffect that Charlie had only acted as he should himself have done,\nunder the same circumstances; and that, at the present time, he should\nnot think of depriving himself of the services of one gallant soldier,\neven if he had maltreated a dozen civilians.\n\nAs Clive had been given paramount authority in Bengal, and as Mr.\nDrake had every reason to suppose that he, himself, would be recalled\nas soon as the circumstances attending the capture of Calcutta were\nknown in England, he was unable to do anything further in the matter,\nand Charlie landed with Clive on the 28th. The force consisted of two\nhundred and fifty Europeans, and twelve hundred Sepoys, who were\nforced to drag with them, having no draft animals, two field pieces\nand a waggon of ammunition.\n\nThe march was an excessively fatiguing one. The country was swampy in\nthe extreme, and intersected with watercourses; and, after a terribly\nfatiguing night march, and fifteen hours of unintermittent labour,\nthey arrived, at eight o'clock in the morning, at the hollow bed of a\nlake, now perfectly dry. It lay some ten feet below the surrounding\ncountry, and was bordered with jungle. In the wet season it was full\nof water. On the eastern and southern banks lay an abandoned village,\nand it was situated about a mile and a half from the fort of Baj-baj.\n\nClive was ill, and unable to see after matters himself. Indeed,\naccustomed only to the feeble forces of Southern India, who had never\nstood for a moment against him in battle, he had no thought of danger.\nUpon the other hand the troops of the nabob, who had had no\nexperience, whatever, of the superior fighting powers of the\nEuropeans; and who had effected so easy a conquest at Calcutta,\nflushed with victory, regarded their European foes with contempt, and\nwere preparing to annihilate them at a blow.\n\nManak Chand, the general commanding the nabob's forces, informed by\nspies of the movements of the English troops, moved out with fifteen\nhundred horses and two thousand foot. So worn out were the British\nupon their arrival at the dried bed of the lake that, after detaching\na small body to occupy a village near the enemy's fort, from which\nalone danger was expected; while another took up the post in some\njungles, by the side of the main road, the rest threw themselves down\nto sleep. Some lay in the village, some in the shade of the bushes\nalong the sides of the hollow. Their arms were all piled in a heap,\nsixty yards from the eastern bank. The two field pieces stood\ndeserted, on the north side of the village. Not a single sentry was\nposted.\n\nManak Chand, knowing that, after marching all night, they would be\nexhausted, now stole upon them, and surrounded the tank on three\nsides. Happily, he did not perceive that their arms were piled at a\ndistance of sixty yards from the nearest man. Had he done so, the\nEnglish would have been helpless in his hands. After waiting an hour,\nto be sure that the last of the English were sound asleep, he ordered\na tremendous fire to be opened on the hollow and village.\n\nAstounded at this sudden attack, the men sprang up from their deep\nsleep, and a rush was instantly made to their arms. Clive, ever\ncoolest in danger, shouted to them to be steady, and his officers well\nseconded his attempts. Unfortunately the artillerymen, in their sudden\nsurprise, instead of rushing to their cannon, joined the rest of the\ntroops as they ran back to their arms, and the guns at once fell into\nthe hands of the enemy.\n\nThese had now climbed the eastern bank, and a fire from all sides was\npoured upon the troops, huddled together in a mass.\n\n\"Major Marryat,\" Clive said, \"if we fall back now, fatigued as the men\nare, and shaken by this surprise, we are lost. Do you take a wing of\nthe Sepoy battalion, and clear the right bank. I will advance, with\nthe main body, directly on the village.\"\n\n\"Come on, my lads,\" Charlie shouted, in Hindostanee; \"show them how\nthe men of Madras can fight.\"\n\nThe Sepoys replied with a cheer, advanced with a rush against the\nbank, drove the defenders at once from the point where they charged,\nand then swept round the tank towards the village, which Clive had\nalready attacked in front.\n\nThe loss of Charlie's battalion was small, but the main body, exposed\nto the concentrated fire, suffered more heavily. They would not,\nhowever, be denied. Reaching the bank, they poured a volley into the\nvillage, and charged with the bayonet; just as Charlie's men dashed in\nat the side. The enemy fled from the village and, taking shelter in\nthe jungles around, opened fire. The shouts of their officers could be\nheard, urging them again to sally out and fall upon the British; but\nat this moment, the party which had been sent forward along the road,\nhearing the fray, came hurrying up and poured their fire into the\njungle.\n\nSurprised at this reinforcement, the enemy paused as they were issuing\nfrom the wood, and then fell back upon their cavalry. The British\nartillerymen ran out, and seized the guns, and opened with them upon\nthe retiring infantry. Clive now formed up his troops in line, and\nadvanced against the enemy's cavalry, behind which their infantry had\nmassed for shelter.\n\nManak Chand ordered his cavalry to charge, but just as he did so, a\ncannonball from one of Clive's field pieces passed close to his head.\nThe sensation was so unpleasant that he at once changed his mind. The\norder for retreat was given, and the beaten army fell back, in\ndisorder, to Calcutta.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21. The Battle Outside Calcutta.\n\n\nAfter the defeat of the enemy, who had surprised and so nearly\nannihilated him, Clive marched at once towards the fort of Baj-baj. On\nthe way he met Major Kilpatrick, who was advancing, with a force which\nhad been landed from the ships when the sound of firing was heard, to\nhis assistance.\n\nThe fleet had, at daybreak, opened a heavy fire upon the ramparts; and\nby the afternoon effected a breach. As his men were greatly fatigued,\nand had had but an hour's sleep, Clive determined upon delaying the\nattack until the morning; and a party of two hundred and fifty\nsailors, with two guns, were landed to take part in the storming.\n\nMany of these sailors had drunk freely before landing, and as night\nfell, some of them strolled towards the fort. One of the number, named\nStrahan, moved along, unobserved by the enemy, to the foot of the\nbreach, climbed up it, and came suddenly upon a party of its defenders\nsitting round a fire, smoking. Strahan immediately fired his pistol\namong them, with a shout of, \"The fort is mine!\" and then gave three\nrousing cheers.\n\nThe enemy leaped to their feet and ran off for a little way. Then,\nseeing Strahan was alone, they rushed back and attacked him, firing as\nthey came. Strahan, drawing his cutlass, defended himself vigorously\nfor some time; but his weapon broke off at the hilt, just as a number\nof Sepoys and men of the 39th, who had been awakened from their sleep\nby the shouting and firing, came running up. Reinforcements of the\ngarrison also joined their friends, but these were dispirited by the\nsudden and unexpected attack; and, as the troops continued to stream\nup the breach, the garrison were pressed; and, losing heart, fled\nthrough the opposite gate of the fort.\n\nThe only casualty on the British side was that Captain Campbell,\nmarching up at the head of the Sepoys, was mistaken for an enemy by\nthe sailors, and shot dead. Strahan was, in the morning, severely\nreprimanded by the admiral for his breach of discipline; and, retiring\nfrom the cabin, said to his comrades:\n\n\"Well, if I am flogged for this here action, I will never take another\nfort, by myself, as long as I live.\"\n\nManak Chand was so alarmed at the fighting powers shown by the English\nin these two affairs, that, leaving only a garrison of five hundred\nmen at Calcutta, he retired with his army to join the nabob at\nMoorshedabad. When the fleet arrived before the town, the enemy\nsurrendered the fort at the first shot, and it was again taken\npossession of by the English.\n\nMajor Kilpatrick was at once sent up, with five ships and a few\nhundred men, to capture the town of Hoogly, twenty miles farther up.\nThe defences of the place were strong. It was held by two thousand\nmen, and three thousand horsemen lay around it. The ships, however, at\nonce opened a cannonade upon it, and effected a breach before night,\nand at daybreak the place was taken by storm.\n\nTwo days after the capture of Calcutta, the news arrived that war had\nagain been declared between England and France. It was fortunate that\nthis was not known a little earlier; for had the French forces been\njoined to those under Manak Chand, the reconquest of Calcutta would\nnot have been so easily achieved.\n\nThe nabob, furious at the loss of Calcutta, and the capture and sack\nof Hoogly, at once despatched a messenger to the governor of the\nFrench colony of Chandranagore, to join him in crushing the English.\nThe governor, however, had received orders that, in the event of war\nbeing declared between England and France, he was, if possible, to\narrange with the English that neutrality should be observed between\nthem. He therefore refused the nabob's request, and then sent\nmessengers to Calcutta, to treat.\n\nThe nabob had gathered an army of ten thousand foot and fifteen\nthousand horse, and advanced against Calcutta, arriving before the\ntown on the 2nd February, 1757. Clive's force had now, owing to the\narrival of some reinforcements from Europe, and the enlisting of fresh\nSepoys, been raised to seven hundred European infantry, a hundred\nartillerymen, and fifteen hundred Sepoys, with fourteen light field\npieces.\n\nThe whole of the town of Calcutta was surrounded by a deep cut, with a\nbank behind, called the Mahratta Ditch. A mile beyond this was a large\nsaltwater lake, so that an enemy advancing from the north would have\nto pass within a short distance of Clive's intrenched position outside\nthe town, affording him great opportunities for a flank attack. On the\nday of their arrival Clive marched out, but the enemy opened a heavy\nfire, and he retired.\n\nClive determined to attack the enemy, next morning. Admiral Watson, at\nhis request, at once landed five hundred and sixty sailors, under the\ncommand of Captain Warwick of the Thunderer. A considerable portion of\nthe enemy had crossed the Mahratta Ditch, and encamped within it. The\nnabob himself pitched his tent in the garden of Omichund (a native\nCalcutta merchant who, though in the nabob's camp from motives of\npolicy, sympathized entirely with the English), which occupied an\nadvanced bastion within the Mahratta Ditch. The rest of the army were\nencamped between the ditch and the saltwater lake.\n\nClive's intentions were to march first against the battery which had\nplayed on him so effectually the day before; and, having carried this,\nto march directly against the garden in which the nabob was encamped.\nThe force with which he started, at three o'clock in the morning of\nthe 3rd, consisted of the five hundred and sixty sailors, who drew\nwith them six guns, six hundred and fifty European infantry, a hundred\nEuropean artillery, and eight hundred Sepoys. Half the Sepoys led the\nadvance, the remainder covered the rear.\n\nSoon after daybreak, the Sepoys came in contact with the enemy's\nadvanced guard, placed in ditches along a road leading from the head\nof the lake to the Mahratta Ditch. These discharged their muskets, and\nsome rockets, and took to flight. One of the rockets caused a serious\ndisaster. The Sepoys had their ammunition pouches open, and the\ncontents of one of these was fired by the rocket. The flash of the\nflame communicated the fire to the pouch of the next Sepoy, and so the\nflame ran along the line, killing, wounding, and scorching many, and\ncausing the greatest confusion. Fortunately the enemy were not near,\nand Captain Eyre Coote, who led the British infantry behind them,\naided Charlie, who led the advance, in restoring order, and the\nforward movement again went on.\n\nA new obstacle had, however, arisen. With the morning a dense fog had\nset in, rendering it impossible for the troops to see even a few yards\nin advance of them. Still they pushed on and, unopposed, reached a\npoint opposite Omichund's garden, but divided from it by the Mahratta\nDitch.\n\nPresently they heard the thunder of a great body of approaching\ncavalry. They waited quietly until the unseen horse had approached\nwithin a few yards of them, and then poured a mighty volley into the\nfog. The noise ceased abruptly, and was followed by that of the\nenemy's cavalry in retreat.\n\nThe fog was now so dense that it was impossible even to judge of the\ndirections in which the troops were moving. Clive knew, however, that\nthe Mahratta Ditch was on his right and, moving a portion of his\ntroops till they touched this, he again advanced, his object being to\ngain a causeway which, raised several feet above the country, led from\nCalcutta, across the Mahratta Ditch, into the country beyond. Towards\nthis Clive now advanced, his troops firing, as they marched, into the\nfog ahead of them, and the guns firing from the flanks, obliquely, to\nthe right and left.\n\nWithout experiencing any opposition Clive reached the causeway, and\nthe Sepoys, turning to their right, advanced along this towards the\nditch. As they crossed this, however, they came in the line of fire of\ntheir own guns, the officer commanding them being ignorant of what was\ntaking place in front, and unable to see a foot before him. Charlie,\nclosely accompanied always by Tim, was at the head of his troops when\nthe iron hail of the English guns struck the head of the column,\nmowing down numbers of men. A panic ensued, and the Sepoys, terror\nstricken at this discharge, from a direction in which they considered\nthemselves secure, leaped from the causeway into the dry ditch and\nsheltered themselves there. Charlie and his companion were saved by\nthe fact that they were a few paces ahead of the column.\n\n\"Run back, Tim,\" Charlie said. \"Find Colonel Clive, and tell him that\nwe are being mowed down by our own artillery. If you can't find him,\nhurry back to the guns, and tell the officer what he is doing.\"\n\nCharlie then leaped down into the ditch, and endeavoured to rally the\nSepoys. A few minutes later Clive himself arrived, and the Sepoys were\ninduced to leave the ditch, and to form again by the side of the\ncauseway, along which the British troops were now marching.\n\nSuddenly, however, from the fog burst out the discharge of two heavy\nguns, which the enemy had mounted on a bastion flanking the ditch. The\nshouts of the officers, and the firing of the men, indicated precisely\nthe position of the column. The grapeshot tore through it, and\ntwenty-two of the English troops fell dead and wounded. Immediately\nafterwards another discharge followed, and the column, broken and\nconfused, bewildered by the dense fog, and dismayed by the fire of\nthese unseen guns, fell back.\n\nClive now determined to push on to the main road, which he knew\ncrossed the fields half a mile in front of him. The country was,\nhowever, here laid out in rice fields, each inclosed by banks and\nditches. Over these banks it was impossible to drag the guns, and the\nsailors could only get them along by descending into the ditches, and\nusing these as roads. The labour was prodigious, and the men, fatigued\nand harassed by this battle in darkness, and by the fire from the\nunseen guns which the enemy continued to pour in their direction from\neither flank, began to lose heart.\n\nHappily, however, the fog began to lift. The flanks of the columns\nwere covered by bodies of troops, thrown out on either side, and after\nmore than an hour's hard work, and abandoning two of the guns which\nhad broken down, Clive reached the main road, again formed his men in\ncolumn, and advanced towards the city.\n\nThe odds were overwhelmingly against him. There were guns, infantry,\nand cavalry, both in front and behind them. The column pressed on, in\nspite of the heavy fire, crossed the ditch, and attacked a strong body\nof the enemy drawn up on the opposite side. While it did so, a great\nforce of the nabob's cavalry swept down on the rear, and for a moment\ncaptured the guns. Ensign Yorke, of the 39th Foot, faced the rear\ncompany about, and made a gallant charge upon the horsemen, drove them\nback, and recaptured the guns.\n\nClive's whole army was now across the ditch, and it was open to him\neither to carry out his original plan of attacking Omichund's garden,\nor of marching forward into the fort of Calcutta. Seeing that his men\nwere fatigued, and worn out with six hours of labour and marching\nunder the most difficult circumstances, he took the latter\nalternative, entered Calcutta, and then, following the stream, marched\nback to the camp he had left in the morning.\n\nHis loss amounted to thirty-nine Europeans killed, and eighteen\nSepoys; eighty-two Europeans wounded, and thirty-five Sepoys; the\ncasualties being caused almost entirely by the enemy's cannon.\n\nThe expedition, from a military point of view, had been an entire\nfailure. He had carried neither the battery nor Omichund's garden. Had\nit not been for the fog he might have succeeded in both these objects;\nbut, upon the other hand, the enemy were as much disconcerted by the\nfog as he was, and were unable to use their forces with any effect.\nMilitary critics have decided that the whole operation was a mistake;\nbut although a mistake and a failure, its consequences were no less\ndecisive.\n\nThe nabob, struck with astonishment at the daring and dash of the\nEnglish, in venturing with so small a force to attack him, and to\nmarch through the very heart of his camp, was seized with terror. He\nhad lost thirteen hundred men in the fight, among whom were\ntwenty-four rajahs and lesser chiefs, and the next morning he sent in\na proposal for peace.\n\nA less determined man than Clive would, no doubt, have accepted the\nproposal. Calcutta was still besieged by a vastly superior force,\nsupplies of all kinds were running short, the attack of the previous\nday had been a failure. He knew, however, the character of Asiatics,\nand determined to play the game of bounce. The very offer of the nabob\nshowed him that the latter was alarmed. He therefore wrote to him,\nsaying that he had simply marched his troops through his highness'\ncamp to show him of what British soldiers were capable; but that he\nhad been careful to avoid hurting anyone, except those who actually\nopposed his progress. He concluded by expressing his willingness to\naccede to the nabob's proposal, and to negotiate.\n\nThe nabob took it all in. If all this destruction and confusion had\nbeen wrought by a simple march through his camp, what would be the\nresult if Clive were to take into his head to attack him in earnest?\nHe therefore at once withdrew his army three miles to the rear, and\nopened negotiations. He granted all that the English asked: that all\nthe property and privileges of the Company should be restored, that\nall their goods should pass into the country free of tax, that all the\nCompany's factories, and all moneys and properties belonging to it or\nits servants, should be restored or made good, and that permission\nshould be given to them to fortify Calcutta as they pleased.\n\nHaving agreed to these conditions, the nabob, upon the 11th of\nFebruary, retired with his army to his capital; leaving Omichund with\na commission to propose to the English a treaty of alliance, offensive\nand defensive, against all enemies. This proposal was a most\nacceptable one, and Clive determined to seize the opportunity to crush\nthe French. His previous experiences, around Madras, had taught him\nthat the French were the most formidable rivals of England in India.\nHe knew that large reinforcements were on their way to Pondicherry,\nand he feared that the nabob, when he recovered from his panic, might\nregret the conditions which he had granted, and might ally himself\nwith the French in an effort, again, to expel the English.\n\nHe therefore determined at once to attack the French. The deputies\nsent by Monsieur Renault, the governor of Chandranagore, had been kept\nwaiting from day to day, under one pretence or another; and they now\nwrote to the governor that they believed that there was no real\nintention, on the part of the English, to sign an agreement of\nneutrality with him; and that they would be the next objects of\nattack. Monsieur Renault immediately sent messengers to the nabob,\nurging upon him that, if the English were allowed to annihilate the\nFrench, they would be more dangerous enemies than ever; and\nSuraja-u-Dowlah, having now recovered from his terror, wrote at once\nto Calcutta, peremptorily forbidding any hostilities against the\nFrench.\n\nTo show his determination, he despatched fifteen hundred men to\nHoogly, which the English had abandoned after capturing it, with\ninstructions to help the French if attacked; and he sent a lac of\nrupees to Monsieur Renault, to aid him in preparing for his defence.\n\nClive, unwilling to face a coalition between the French and the nabob,\nwas in favour of acceding to the nabob's orders. The treaty of\nneutrality with the French was drawn up, and would have been signed,\nhad it not been for the obstinate refusal of Admiral Watson to agree\nto it. Between that officer and Clive there had never been any cordial\nfeeling, and from the time of their first connection, at the siege of\nGheriah, differences of opinion, frequently leading to angry disputes,\nhad taken place between them. Nor was it strange that this should be\nso. Both were brave and gallant men; but while Watson had the\npunctilious sense of honor which naturally belongs to an English\ngentleman, Clive was wholly unscrupulous as to the means which he\nemployed to gain his ends.\n\nBetween two such men, it is not singular that disagreements arose.\nAdmiral Watson, impelled by feelings of personal dislike to Clive,\noften allowed himself to be carried to unwarrantable lengths. On the\noccasion of the capture of Calcutta, he ordered Captain Eyre Coote,\nwho first entered it, to hold it in the king's name, and to disobey\nClive's orders, although the latter had been granted a commission in\nthe royal army as lieutenant colonel, and was, moreover, the chief\nauthority of the Company in all affairs on land. Upon Clive's\nasserting himself, Admiral Watson absolutely threatened to open fire\nupon his troops. Apparently from a sheer feeling of opposition, he now\nopposed the signing of the treaty with the French, and several days\nwere spent in stormy altercations.\n\nCircumstances occurred, during this time, which strengthened the view\nhe took, and changed those of Clive and his colleagues of the council.\nJust then, the news reached Suraja-u-Dowlah that Delhi had been\ncaptured by the Afghans; and, terrified at the thought that the\nvictorious northern enemy might next turn their arms against him, he\nwrote to Clive, begging him to march to his assistance, and offering a\nlac of rupees a month towards the expense of his army.\n\nOn the same day that Clive received the letter, he heard that\nCommodore James and three ships, with reinforcements from Bombay, had\narrived at the mouth of the Hoogly; and that the Cumberland, with\nthree hundred troops, which had grounded on her way from Madras, was\nnow coming up the river.\n\nAlmost at the same moment he heard, from Omichund, who had accompanied\nthe nabob to Moorshedabad, that he had bribed the governor of Hoogly\nto offer no opposition to the passage of the troops up the river.\n\nClive was now ready to agree to Admiral Watson's views, and to advance\nat once against Chandranagore; but the admiral again veered round, and\nrefused to agree to the measure, unless the consent of the nabob was\nobtained. He wrote, however, himself, a threatening, and indeed\nviolent letter to the nabob, ordering him to give his consent. The\nnabob, still under the influence of his fears from the Afghans,\nreplied in terms which amounted to consent, but the very next day,\nhaving received news which calmed his fears as to the Afghans, he\nwrote peremptorily, forbidding the expedition against the French. This\nletter, however, was disregarded, and the expedition prepared to\nstart.\n\nIt consisted of seven hundred Europeans and fifteen hundred native\ninfantry, who started by land; a hundred and fifty artillery\nproceeding in boats, escorted by three ships of war and several\nsmaller vessels, under Admiral Watson.\n\nThe French garrison consisted only of a hundred and forty-six French,\nand three hundred Sepoys. Besides these were three hundred of the\nEuropean population, and sailors of the merchant ships in port, who\nhad been hastily formed into a militia.\n\nThe governor, indignant at the duplicity with which he had been\ntreated, had worked vigorously at his defences. The settlement\nextended along the river banks for two miles. In the centre stood the\nfort, which was a hundred and twenty yards square, mounting ten\nthirty-two pounder guns on each of its four bastions. Twenty\nfour-pounder guns were placed on the ramparts, facing the river on the\nsouth. On an outlying work commanding the watergate eight thirty-two\npounders were mounted. Monsieur Renault set to work to demolish all\nthe houses within a hundred yards of the fort, and to erect batteries\ncommanding the approaches. He ordered an officer to sink several ships\nin the only navigable channel, about a hundred and fifty yards to the\nsouth of the fort, at a point commanded by the guns of one of the\nbatteries.\n\nThe officer was a traitor. He purposely sank the ships in such a\nposition as to leave a channel, through which the English ships might\npass; and then, seizing his opportunity, deserted to them.\n\nOn approaching the town Clive, knowing that Charlie could speak the\nnative language fluently, asked him whether he would undertake to\nreconnoitre the position of the enemy, with which he was entirely\nunacquainted. Charlie willingly agreed. When, on the night of the 13th\nof March, the army halted a few miles from the town, Charlie,\ndisguising himself in a native dress and accompanied by Hossein, left\nthe camp and made his way to the town. This he had no difficulty in\nentering. It extended a mile and a half back from the river, and\nconsisted of houses standing in large gardens and inclosures. The\nwhole of the Europeans were labouring at the erection of the\nbatteries, and the destruction of the houses surrounding them; and\nCharlie and his companion, approaching closely to one of these, were\npounced upon by the French officer in command of a working party, and\nset to work, with a number of natives, in demolishing the houses.\n\nCharlie, with his usual energy, threw himself into the work, and would\nspeedily have called attention to himself, by the strength and\nactivity which he displayed, had not Hossein begged him to moderate\nhis efforts.\n\n\"Native man never work like that, sahib. Not when he's paid ever so\nmuch. Work still less, no pay. The French would soon notice the sahib,\nif he laboured like that.\"\n\nThus admonished, Charlie adapted his actions to those of his\ncompanions and, after working until dawn approached, he managed, with\nHossein, to evade the attention of the officer; and, drawing off,\nhurried away to rejoin Clive. The latter was moving from the west, by\na road leading to the northern face of the fort. It was at the battery\nwhich Renault was erecting upon this road that Charlie had been\nlabouring. The latter informed Clive of the exact position of the\nwork, and also, that although strong by itself, it was commanded by\nmany adjoining houses; which the French, in spite of their efforts,\nhad not time to destroy.\n\nThis news decided Clive to advance immediately, without giving the\nenemy further time to complete their operations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22. Plassey.\n\n\nAs the English troops advanced, they were met on the outskirts of the\nsettlement by the enemy, who contested bravely every garden and\ninclosure with them. The British force was, however, too strong to be\nresisted, and gradually the French were driven back, until they formed\nin rear of the battery. Clive at once took possession of the houses\nsurrounding it, and from them kept up, all day, a heavy fire upon the\ndefenders; until, at nightfall, these fell back upon the fort, after\nspiking their guns. The loss of this position compelled the French to\nabandon the other outlying batteries, from which, during the night,\nthey withdrew their guns into the fort.\n\nThe next four days Clive spent in bringing up the guns landed from the\nfleet, and establishing batteries round the fort; and on the 19th he\nopened fire against it. On the same day the three men of war; the Kent\nof sixty-four guns, the Tiger of sixty, and the Salisbury of fifty,\nanchored just below the channel, which the governor believed he had\nblocked up. The next four days were spent by the fleet in sounding, to\ndiscover whether the statements of the French deserter were correct.\n\nDuring this time, a heavy cannonade was kept up unceasingly between\nClive and the fort. In this the garrison had the best of it, silenced\nsome of the English guns, killed many of the assailants, and would\ncertainly have beaten off the land attack, had the fleet not been able\nto interfere in the struggle.\n\nAll this time, the governor was hoping that aid would arrive from the\nnabob. The latter, indeed, did send a force under Rajah Dulab Ram, but\nthe governor of Hoogly, bribed by Omichund, sent messages to this\nofficer urging him to halt, as Chandranagore was about to surrender,\nand he would only incur the anger of the English, uselessly.\n\nOn the morning of the 23rd, having ascertained that a channel was\nfree, the fleet advanced. The Tiger, leading, made her way through the\npassage and, taking up a position abreast of the northeast bastion of\nthe fort, opened a heavy fire upon it with her guns, and harassed the\nbesieged with a musketry fire from her tops. The Kent was on the point\nof anchoring opposite the watergate, when so heavy a fire was poured\nupon her that, in the confusion, the cable ran out; and the ship\ndropped down, till she anchored at a point exposed to a heavy\ncrossfire from the southeast and southwest bastions. Owing to this\naccident, the Salisbury was forced to anchor a hundred and fifty yards\nbelow the fort.\n\nThe French fought with extreme bravery. Vastly superior as were the\nEnglish force and guns, the French fire was maintained with the\ngreatest energy and spirit, the gunners being directed and animated by\nMonsieur De Vignes, captain of one of the ships which had been sunk.\nNo advantage was gained by the Tiger, in her struggle with the\nnortheast bastion, and the guns of the southwest bastion galled the\nKent so severely that the admiral, neglecting the southeast bastion,\nwas forced to turn the whole of his guns upon it.\n\nDe Vignes concentrated his fire against one point in the Kent, and\npresently succeeded in setting her on fire. The conflagration spread,\na panic ensued, and some seventy or eighty men jumped into the boats\nalongside.\n\nThe officers, however, rallied the rest of the crew. The fire was\nextinguished, the men returned to their duty, and the cannonade was\nrecommenced.\n\nAfter the battle had raged for two hours, the fire of the fort began\nto slacken, as one after another of the guns was dismounted. Monsieur\nRenault saw that the place could be no longer defended. Of his hundred\nand forty-six soldiers, over ninety had been killed and wounded.\nCollecting the remainder, and their officers, with twenty Sepoys, the\ngovernor ordered them to leave the fort immediately; making a detour\nto avoid the English, who were aiding the fleet by attacking the land\nside, and to march to Kossimbazar to join Monsieur Law, who commanded\nthere. Then, there remaining in the fort only the clerks, women, and\nwounded, he hoisted a flag of truce.\n\nTerms were speedily arranged. The governor, and all the civilians and\nnatives, were allowed to go where they chose, with their clothes and\nlinen. The wounded French soldiers were to remain, as prisoners of\nwar.\n\nChandranagore cost the English two hundred and six men. The attack\nupon the French colony was blamed by many, at the time, for in the\nhour of English distress they had offered to remain neutral, instead\nof joining the nabob in crushing us. Upon the other hand, there was\nforce in the arguments with which Admiral Watson had defended his\nrefusal to sign the treaty of neutrality. That treaty would not be\nbinding, unless ratified by Pondicherry; and to Pondicherry it was\nknown that the most powerful fleet and army France had ever sent to\nIndia was on its way. It was also known that Bussy, at the court of\nthe Nizam of the Deccan, was in communication with the nabob. Thus,\nthen, in a short time English interests in India might be menaced more\nformidably than ever before, and the crushing out of the French\ncolony, almost at the gates of Calcutta, was a measure of extreme\nimportance. It was hard upon the gallant governor of Chandranagore,\nbut public opinion generally agreed that the urgency of the case\njustified the course adopted by the English authorities at Calcutta.\n\nSuraja-u-Dowlah was filled with fury, at the news of the capture of\nChandranagore; but hearing a rumour, two days later, that the Afghans\nwere upon their march to attack him, he wrote letters to Clive and\nWatson, congratulating them upon their success, and offering to them\nthe territory of Chandranagore, on the same terms upon which it had\nbeen held by the French.\n\nBut the young tyrant of Moorshedabad was swayed by constantly\nfluctuating feeling. At one moment his fears were uppermost; the next,\nhis anger and hate of the English. Instead of recalling the army of\nRajah Dulab Ram, as he had promised, he ordered it to halt at Plassey,\na large village twenty-two miles south of Moorshedabad.\n\nThe English were represented at his court by Mr. Watts, who had the\ngreatest difficulty in maintaining his position, in the constantly\nchanging moods of the nabob. One day the latter would threaten to\norder him to be led to instant execution, the next he would load him\nwith presents.\n\nBesides Mr. Watts, the English affairs were conducted by Omichund who,\naided by the Sets, or native bankers, whom Suraja-u-Dowlah had\nplundered and despoiled, got up a conspiracy among the nabob's most\nintimate followers.\n\nThe history of these intrigues is the most unpleasant feature in the\nlife of Clive. Meer Jaffier, the nabob's general, himself offered to\nMr. Watts to turn traitor, if the succession to the kingdom was\nbestowed upon him. This was agreed to, upon his promise to pay, not\nonly immense sums to the Company, but enormous amounts to the\nprincipal persons on the English side. So enormous, indeed, were these\ndemands, that even Meer Jaffier, anxious as he was to conclude the\nalliance, was aghast. The squadron was to have two million and a half\nrupees, and the same amount was to be paid for the army. Presents\namounting to six millions of rupees were to be distributed between\nClive, Major Kilpatrick, the governor, and the members of the council.\nClive's share of these enormous sums amounted to two million, eighty\nthousand rupees. In those days, a rupee was worth half a crown. Never\ndid an English officer make such a bargain for himself.\n\nBut even this is not the most dishonorable feature of the transaction.\nOmichund had, for some time, been kept in the dark as to what was\ngoing forward; but, obtaining information through his agents, he\nquestioned Mr. Watts concerning it. The latter then informed him of\nthe whole state of affairs, and Omichund, whose services to the\nEnglish had been immense, naturally demanded a share of the plunder.\n\nWhether or not he threatened to divulge the plot to the nabob, unless\nhis demands were satisfied, is doubtful. At any rate, it was\nconsidered prudent to pacify him, and he was accordingly told that he\nshould receive the sum he named. Clive, and the members of the\ncouncil, however, although willing to gratify their own extortionate\ngreed, at the expense of Meer Jaffier, determined to rob Omichund of\nhis share. In order to do this, two copies of the treaty with Meer\nJaffier were drawn up, on different coloured papers. They were exactly\nalike, except that, in one, the amount to be given to Omichund was\nentirely omitted. This was the real treaty. The other was intended to\nbe destroyed, after being shown to a friend of Omichund, in order to\nconvince the latter that all was straight and honorable.\n\nAll the English authorities placed their signatures to the real\ntreaty, but Admiral Watson indignantly refused to have anything to do\nwith the fictitious one; or to be a party, in any way, to the deceit\npractised on Omichund. In order to get out of the difficulty, Clive\nhimself forged Admiral Watson's signature to the fictitious treaty.\n\nA more disgraceful transaction was never entered into, by a body of\nEnglish gentlemen. That Mr. Drake and the members of his council, the\npitiful cowards who fled from Calcutta, and refused to allow the ships\nto draw off its brave garrison, should consent to such a transaction\nwas but natural; but that Clive, the gallant and dashing commander,\nshould have stooped to it, is sad, indeed.\n\nIt may be said that, to the end of his life, Clive defended his\nconduct in this transaction, under the excuse that Omichund was a\nscoundrel. The Indian was not, indeed, an estimable character. Openly,\nhe was the friend and confidant of the nabob while, all the time, he\nwas engaged in bribing and corrupting his officers, and in plotting\nwith his enemies. This, however, in no way alters the facts that he\nrendered inestimable service to the English; and that the men who\ndeceived and cheated him were, to the full, as greedy and grasping as\nhimself; without, in the case of the governor and his council, having\nrendered any service whatever to the cause.\n\nAt last, the negotiations were complete. More and more severely did\nClive press upon the nabob. Having compelled him to expel Law and the\nFrench, first from Moorshedabad and then from his dominions, he\npressed fresh demands upon him; until the unfortunate prince, driven\nto despair, and buoyed up with the hope that he should receive\nassistance from Bussy, who had just expelled the English from their\nfactory at Vizapatam, ordered Meer Jaffier to advance, with fifteen\nthousand men, to reinforce Rajah Dulab Ram at Plassey.\n\nClive, in fact, forced on hostilities. His presence, with that of a\nconsiderable portion of his army, was urgently required at Madras. He\nwas sure, however, that the instant he had gone, and the English force\nwas greatly weakened, the nabob would again commence hostilities; and\nthe belief was shared by all in India. He was, therefore, determined\nto force on the crisis, as soon as possible; in order that, the nabob\nbeing disposed of, he should be able to send reinforcements to Madras.\n\nWhile these negotiations had been going on, Charlie Marryat had\nremained in Calcutta. He had been severely wounded in the attack on\nChandranagore, and was carried down to Calcutta in a boat. On arriving\nthere, he heard that the Lizzie Anderson had just cast anchor off the\nfort. He caused himself at once to be conveyed on board, and was\nreceived with the greatest heartiness and pleasure, by his old friend,\nthe captain; and assiduously attended by the doctor of the ship. In\norder that he might have as much air as possible, the captain had a\nsort of tent, with a double covering, erected on deck. During the\ndaytime the sides of this were lifted, so that the air could pass\nfreely across the bed.\n\nCharlie's wound was a severe one and, had he been nursed in a hospital\non shore, it is probable that it would have been fatal. Thanks,\nhowever, to the comforts on board ship, the freshness and coolness of\nthe situation, and the care of all surrounding him, he was, after some\nweeks' illness, pronounced convalescent; and was sufficiently\nrecovered to join the force with which Clive marched against Plassey.\n\nThis force consisted of nine hundred and fifty European infantry, a\nhundred artillerymen, fifty sailors, and two thousand one hundred\nSepoys. The artillery consisted of eight six-pounders and two small\nhowitzers. The army of the nabob was fifty thousand strong, and\nagainst such a force it was, indeed, an adventurous task for an army\nof three thousand men, of whom only one-third were Europeans, to\nadvance to the attack. Everything depended, in fact, upon Meer Jaffier\nand his two colleagues in treachery, Rajah Dulab Ram and Yar Lutf\nKhan.\n\nThe nabob, on hearing of Clive's advance, had sent to Monsieur Law;\nwho was, with a hundred and fifty men, at a place over a hundred miles\ndistant; to which he had, in accordance with the orders of Clive, been\nobliged to retire; and begged him to advance to join him, with all\nspeed. The nabob had with him forty or fifty Frenchmen, commanded by\nMonsieur Saint Frais, formerly one of the council of Chandranagore.\nThese had some field pieces of their own, and also directed the native\nartillery, of fifty-three guns; principally thirty-two, twenty-four,\nand eighteen pounders.\n\nHad Clive been sure of the cooperation of Meer Jaffier and his\nconfederates, who commanded three out of the four divisions of the\nnabob's army, he need not have hesitated. But he was, till the last\nmoment, in ignorance whether to rely upon them. The nabob, having\nbecome suspicious of Meer Jaffier, had obtained from him an oath,\nsworn on the Koran, of fidelity; and although the traitor continued\nhis correspondence with Clive, his letters were of a very dubious\ncharacter, and Clive was in total ignorance as to his real intentions.\nSo doubtful, indeed, was he that, when only a few miles of ground and\nthe river Bhagirathi lay between him and the enemy, Clive felt the\nposition so serious that he called a council of war; and put to them\nthe question whether they should attack the nabob, or fortify\nthemselves at Katwa, and hold that place until the rainy season, which\nhad just set in with great violence, should abate.\n\nAll the officers above the rank of subalterns, twenty in number, were\npresent. Clive himself, contrary to custom, gave his vote first in\nfavour of halting at Katwa. Major Kilpatrick, who commanded the\nCompany's troops, Major Grant of the 37th, and ten other officers\nvoted the same way. Major Eyre Coote declared in favour of an\nimmediate advance. He argued that the troops were in high spirits, and\nhad hitherto been everywhere successful, and that a delay would allow\nMonsieur Law and his troops to arrive. He considered that, if they\ndetermined not to fight, they should fall back upon Calcutta. Charlie\nMarryat supported him, as did five other officers, all belonging to\nthe Indian service.\n\nThe decision taken, the council separated, and Clive strolled away to\na grove, and sat down by himself. There he thought over, in his mind,\nthe arguments which had been advanced by both sides. He saw the force\nof the arguments which had been adduced by Major Eyre Coote and\nCharlie Marryat; and his own experience showed him that the daring\ncourse is always the most prudent one, in fighting Asiatics. At last,\nhe came to a conclusion. Rising, he returned to the camp; and, meeting\nMajor Coote on the way, informed him that he had changed his mind, and\nwould fight the next day.\n\nCharlie returned to his tent after the council broke up, disheartened\nat the result. He was greeted by Tim.\n\n\"Shure, yer honor, Hossein is in despair. The water has filled up the\nholes, where he makes his fires, and the rain has soaked the wood. Yer\ndinner is not near cooked yet, and half the dishes are spoilt.\"\n\n\"It does not matter a bit, Tim,\" Charlie said. \"You know I'm not\nparticular about my eating, though Hossein will always prepare a\ndinner fit for an alderman.\"\n\n\"We are going to fight them tomorrow, yer honor, I hope,\" Tim said.\n\"It's sick to death I am of wading about here in the wet, like a duck.\nIt's as bare as the bogs of ould Ireland, without the blessings of the\npigs and potatoes, to say nothing of the colleens.\"\n\n\"No, Tim, I'm afraid we're going to stop where we are, for a bit. The\ncouncil of war have decided not to fight.\"\n\n\"Shure and that's bad news,\" Tim said. \"The worst I've heard for many\na day. What if there be fifty thousand of 'em, Mister Charles, haven't\nwe bate 'em at long odds before, and can't we do it agin?\"\n\n\"I think we could, Tim,\" Charlie replied; \"but the odds of fifty-three\nheavy cannon, which the spies say they've got, to our ten popguns, is\nserious. However, I'm sorry we're not going to fight, and I'm afraid\nthat you must make up your mind to the wet, and Hossein his to giving\nme bad dinners for some weeks to come; that is to say, if the enemy\ndon't turn us out of this.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Lieutenant Peters entered the tent.\n\n\"Is it true, Charlie, that we are not going to fight, after all?\"\n\n\"True enough,\" Charlie said. \"We are to wait till the rains are over.\"\n\n\"Rains!\" Peters said, in disgust; \"what have the rains got to do with\nit? If we had a six weeks' march before us, I could understand the wet\nweather being a hindrance. Men are not water rats, and to march all\nday in these heavy downpours, and to lie all night in the mud, would\nsoon tell upon our strength. But here we are, within a day's march of\nthe enemy, and the men might as well get wet in the field as here.\nEveryone longs to be at the enemy, and a halt will have a very bad\neffect.\n\n\"What have you got to drink, Charlie?\"\n\n\"I have some brandy and rum; nothing else,\" Charlie said. \"But what\nwill be better than either for you is a cup of tea. Hossein makes it\nas well as ever. I suppose you have dined?\"\n\n\"Yes, half an hour ago.\"\n\nJust as Charlie finished his meal, Major Eyre Coote put his head into\nthe tent.\n\n\"Marryat, the chief has changed his mind. We cross the river the first\nthing in the morning, and move at once upon Plassey.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" Charlie shouted; \"Clive is himself again. That is good news,\nindeed!\"\n\n\"You will move your Sepoys down to the river at daybreak, and will be\nthe first to cross. There is no chance of any opposition, as the spies\ntell us that the nabob has not arrived yet at Plassey.\"\n\nSeveral other officers afterwards dropped into the tent, for the news\nrapidly spread through the camp. There was, as had been the case at\nthe council, considerable differences of opinion as to the prudence of\nthe measure; but among the junior officers and men, the news that the\nenemy were to be attacked, at once, was received with hearty\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Here, major,\" a fellow subaltern of Peters' said, as he entered the\ntent, followed by a servant; \"I have brought in half a dozen bottles\nof champagne. I started with a dozen from Calcutta, and had intended\nto keep these to celebrate our victory. But as, in the first place,\nall heavy baggage is to be left here; and in the second, it has\noccurred to me that possibly I may not come back to help to drink it;\nwe may as well turn it to the good purpose of drinking success to the\nexpedition.\"\n\nSome of the bottles were opened, and a merry evening was spent; but\nthe party broke up early, for they had a heavy day's work before them,\non the morrow.\n\nAt daybreak, the troops were in movement towards the banks of the\nBhagirathi. They had brought boats with them from Chandranagore, and\nthe work of crossing the river continued, without intermission, until\nfour in the afternoon, when the whole force was landed on the left\nbank. Here Clive received another letter from Meer Jaffier, informing\nhim that the nabob had halted at Mankarah, and intended to entrench\nhimself there. He suggested that the English should undertake a\ncircuitous march, and attack him in the rear; but as this march would\nhave exposed Clive to being cut off from his communications, and as he\nwas still very doubtful of the good faith of the conspirators, he\ndetermined to march straight forward; and sent word to Meer Jaffier,\nto that effect.\n\nFrom the point where Clive had crossed the Bhagirathi it was fifteen\nmiles to Plassey, following, as they did, the curves of the river. It\nwas necessary to do this, as they had no carriage; and the men were\nobliged to tow their supplies in boats, against the stream.\n\nOrders were issued that, as soon as the troops were across, they\nshould prepare to eat their dinners, as the march was to be resumed at\nonce. The rain was coming down in a steady pour as the troops,\ndrenched to the skin, started upon their march. The stream, swollen by\nthe rains, was in full flood, and the work of towing the heavy-laden\nbarges was wearisome in the extreme. All took a share in the toil. In\nmany cases the river had overflowed its banks, and the troops had to\nstruggle through the water, up to their waists, while they tugged and\nstrained at the ropes.\n\nCharlie, as a mounted officer, rode at the head of his Sepoys; who\nformed the advance of the force. Three hundred men preceded the main\nbody, who were towing the boats, to guard them from any sudden\nsurprise. Tim marched beside him, occasionally falling back, and\ntaking a turn at the ropes.\n\n\"This is dog's work, Mister Charles,\" he said. \"It's lucky that it's\nraining, for the river can't make us wetter than we are. My hands are\nfairly sore, with pulling at the ropes.\"\n\n\"Ah, Tim, you're not fond of ropes, you know. You remember that night\nat Moorshedabad.\"\n\n\"Faith, yer honor, and I'll not forget it, if I live to be as old as\nMethuselah. Well, yer honor, it will be hard on us if we do not thrash\nthem niggers, tomorrow, after all the trouble we are taking to be at\nthem.\"\n\nAt one o'clock in the morning, the weary troops reached the village of\nPlassey. They marched through it, and halted and bivouacked in a large\nmango grove, a short distance beyond.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23. Plassey.\n\n\nScarcely had the soldiers taken off their packs, when the sound of\nmartial music was heard. Charlie was speaking, at the time, to Major\nCoote.\n\n\"There are the enemy, sure enough,\" the latter said. \"That old rascal,\nMeer Jaffier, must have been deceiving us when he said that the nabob\nhad halted at Mankarah. I'm afraid he means to play us false.\"\n\n\"I expect,\" Charlie remarked, \"that he does not know what he means,\nhimself. These Asiatics are at any time ready to turn traitors, and to\njoin the strongest. At present, Jaffier does not know what is the\nstronger; and I think it likely enough that he will take as little\nshare as he can in the battle, tomorrow, till he sees which way it is\ngoing. Then, if we are getting the best of it, the rascal will join\nus, for the sake of the advantages which he expects to gain. If the\nday is going against us, he will do his best to complete his master's\nvictory; and should proofs of his intended treachery ever come to\nlight, he will clear himself by saying that he intended to deceive us\nall along, and merely pretended to treat with us, in order to throw us\noff our guard, and so deliver us into the hands of his master.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Major Eyre Coote replied. \"These Mohammedan chiefs are indeed\ncrafty and treacherous rascals. The whole history of India shows that\ngratitude is a feeling altogether unknown to them; and that, whatever\nfavours a master may have lavished upon them, they are always ready to\nbetray him, if they think that by so doing they will better their\nposition.\n\n\"Now I shall lie down, and try to get a few hours' sleep before\nmorning. I am wet to the skin, but fortunately in these sultry nights\nthat matters little.\"\n\n\"I must go my rounds,\" Charlie said, \"and see that the sentries are on\nthe alert. If the men were not so tired, I should have said that the\nbest plan would have been to make a dash straight at the enemy's camp.\nIt would take them quite unprepared, even if they know, as I daresay\nthey do, that we are close at hand; and they would lose all the\nadvantage of their artillery.\"\n\n\"Yes, if we had arrived an hour before sunset, so as to be able to\nlearn something of the nature of the ground, that would be our best\ncourse,\" Major Coote agreed. \"But, even if the troops had been fresh,\na night attack on an unknown position is a hazardous undertaking.\n\n\"Good night. I must see Clive, and take his last orders.\"\n\nAt daybreak the English were astir, and the position of the enemy\nbecame visible. He occupied strongly intrenched works, which the Rajah\nDulab Ram had thrown up during his stay. The right of these works\nrested on the river; and extended inland, at a right angle to it, for\nabout two hundred yards; and then swept round to the north, at an\nobtuse angle, for nearly three miles. At the angle was a redoubt,\nmounted with cannon. In advance of this was a mound, covered with\njungle. Halfway between the intrenchments and the mango grove were two\nlarge tanks, near the river, surrounded by high mounds of earth. These\ntanks were about half a mile from the English position. On the river\nbank, a little in advance of the grove, was a hunting box belonging to\nthe nabob, surrounded by a masonry wall. Clive took possession of\nthis, immediately he heard the sound of the nabob's music, on his\narrival.\n\nSoon after daylight, the nabob's troops moved out from their\nintrenchments, and it was evident that he was aware of the position of\nthe English. The French, with their four field guns, took up their\npost on the mound of the tank nearest to the grove, and about half a\nmile distant from it; and in the narrow space between them and the\nriver two heavy guns, under a native officer, were placed.\n\nBehind the French guns was the division of Mir Mudin Khan, the one\nfaithful general of the nabob. It consisted of five thousand horse,\nand seven thousand foot. Extending, in the arc of a circle, towards\nthe village of Plassey, were the troops of the three traitor generals\nRajah Dulab Ram, Yar Lutf Khan, and Meer Jaffier. Thus, the English\nposition was almost surrounded; and in advancing against the camp,\nthey would have to expose themselves to an attack in rear by the\ntroops of the conspirators. These generals had, between them, nearly\nthirty-eight thousand troops.\n\nFrom the roof of the hunting box, Clive watched the progress of the\nenemy's movements. He saw, at once, that the position which they had\ntaken up was one which would entail the absolute destruction of his\nforce, should he be defeated; and that this depended entirely upon the\ncourse taken by the conspirators. Against such a force as that opposed\nto him, if these remained faithful to their master, success could\nhardly be hoped for.\n\nHowever, it was now too late to retreat, and the only course was to\nshow a bold front. Clive accordingly moved his troops out, from the\nmango trees, to a line with the hunting box. The Europeans were formed\nin the centre, with three field pieces on each side. The native troops\nwere on either flank. Two field guns, and the two howitzers, were\nplaced a little in advance of the hunting box, facing the French\nposition on the mound.\n\nAt eight o'clock in the morning, of the 23rd of June, a memorable day\nin the annals of India, the preparations on both sides were complete;\nand Saint Frais opened the battle, by the discharge of one of his guns\nat the English. At the signal, the whole of the artillery round the\nlong curve opened their fire. The ten little guns replied to this\noverwhelming discharge, and for half an hour continued to play on the\ndense masses of the enemy. But, however well they might be handled,\nthey could do little against the fire of the fifty pieces of cannon,\nconcentrated upon them.\n\nHad these been all served by European artillerymen, the British force\nwould have been speedily annihilated as they stood. The natives of\nIndia, however, were extremely clumsy gunners. They fired but slowly,\nand had the feeblest idea of elevation. Consequently their balls, for\nthe most part, went far over the heads of the English; and the four\nfield guns of Saint Frais did more execution than the fifty heavy\npieces of the nabob. At the end of half an hour, however, Clive had\nlost thirty of his men, and determined to fall back to the mango\ngrove.\n\nLeaving a party in the hunting box, and in the brick kilns in front of\nit, in which the guns had been posted, to harass Saint Frais' battery\nwith their musketry fire, he withdrew the rest of his force into the\ngrove. Here they were in shelter, for it was surrounded by a high and\nthick bank. Behind this the men sat down, while parties set to work,\npiercing holes through the banks as embrasures for the guns.\n\nThe enemy, on the retreat of the British within the grove, advanced\nwith loud shouts of triumph; and, bringing their guns closer, again\nopened fire. The British had, by this time, pierced the holes for\ntheir field pieces; and these opened so vigorously that several of the\nenemy's cannon were disabled, numbers of their gunners killed, and\nsome ammunition waggons blown up. On the other hand the English, now\nin perfect shelter, did not suffer at all, although the tops of the\ntrees were cut off, in all directions, by the storm of cannon balls\nwhich swept through them.\n\nAlthough the English fire was producing considerable loss among the\nenemy, this was as nothing in comparison to his enormous numbers; and,\nat eleven o'clock, Clive summoned his principal officers around him;\nand it was agreed that, as Meer Jaffier and his associates, of whose\nposition in the field they were ignorant, showed no signs of drawing\noff, or of treachery to their master, it was impossible to risk an\nattack upon the front; since they would, as they pressed forward, be\nenveloped by the forces in the rear. It was determined, therefore,\nthat unless any unexpected circumstance occurred, they should hold\ntheir present position till nightfall; and should, at midnight, attack\nthe enemy's camp.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, a tremendous tropical shower commenced,\nand for an hour the rain came down in torrents. Gradually the enemy's\nfire slackened. The English had tarpaulins to cover their ammunition,\nwhich, therefore, suffered no injury. The natives had no such\ncoverings, and their powder was soon completely wetted, by the deluge\nof rain. Mir Mudin Khan, knowing that his own guns had been rendered\nuseless, believed that those of the English were in a similar\ncondition; and, leading out his cavalry, made a splendid charge down\nupon the grove.\n\nThe English were in readiness. As the cavalry swept up, a flash of\nfire ran from a thousand muskets, from the top of the embankments;\nwhile each of the field guns sent its load of grapeshot, through the\nembrasures, into the throng of horsemen.\n\nThe effect was decisive. The cavalry recoiled before the terrible\nfire, and rode back, with their brave leader mortally wounded. This\nblow was fatal to the fortunes of Suraja Dowlah. When the news of the\ndeath of his brave and faithful general reached him, he was struck\nwith terror. He had long suspected Meer Jaffier of treachery, but he\nhad now no one else to rely upon. Sending for that general he reminded\nhim, in touching terms, of the benefits which he had received at the\nhands of his father; and conjured him to be faithful to him. Throwing\nhis turban upon the ground, he said:\n\n\"Jaffier, you must defend that turban.\"\n\nJaffier responded with assurances of his loyalty and sincerity, and\npromised to defend his sovereign with his life. Then, riding off, he\nat once despatched a messenger to Clive, informing him of what had\nhappened, and urging him to attack at once.\n\nAs long as Mir Mudin Khan lived, it is probable that Meer Jaffier was\nstill undecided as to the part he should play. While that general\nlived it was possible, even probable, that the English would be\ndefeated, even should the traitors take no part against them. His\ndeath, however, left the whole management of affairs in the hands of\nthe three conspirators, and their course was now plain.\n\nScarcely had Meer Jaffier left the nabob, than the unhappy young man,\nwho was still under twenty years old, turned to Rajah Dulab Ram for\ncounsel and advice. The traitor gave him counsel that led to his\ndestruction. He told him that the English could not be attacked in\ntheir position; that his troops, exposed to the fire of their guns,\nwere suffering heavily and losing heart; and he advised him, at once,\nto issue orders for them to fall back within their intrenchments. He\nalso advised him to leave the field himself, and to retire to\nMoorshedabad, leaving it to his generals to annihilate the English,\nshould they venture to attack them.\n\nSuraja Dowlah, at no time capable of thinking for himself, and now\nbewildered by the death of the general he knew to be faithful to him,\nand by his doubts as to the fidelity of the others, fell into the\nsnare. He at once issued orders for the troops to retire within their\nintrenchments; and then, mounting a swift camel, and accompanied by\ntwo thousand horsemen, he left the field, and rode off to\nMoorshedabad.\n\nThe movement of retirement at once commenced. The three traitor\ngenerals drew off their troops, and those of Mir Mudin Khan also\nobeyed orders, and fell back. Saint Frais, however, refused to obey.\nHe saw the ruin which would follow upon the retreat, and he pluckily\ncontinued his fire.\n\nClive, after the council had decided that nothing should be done till\nnightfall, had lain down in the hunting box to snatch a little repose,\nhis thoughts having kept him awake all night. Major Kilpatrick, seeing\nthe retirement of the enemy; and that the French artillerymen\nremained, unsupported, on the mound; at once advanced, with two\nhundred and fifty Europeans, and two guns, against it; sending word to\nClive what he was doing. Clive, angry that any officer should have\ntaken so important a step, without consulting him, at once ran after\nthe detachment, and severely reprimanded Major Kilpatrick, for moving\nfrom the grove without orders. Immediately, however, that he\ncomprehended the whole position, he recognized the wisdom of the\ncourse Kilpatrick had taken, and sent him back to the grove, to order\nthe whole force to advance.\n\nSaint Frais, seeing that he was entirely unsupported, fired a last\nshot; and then, limbering up, fell back in perfect order to the\nredoubt at the corner of the intrenchment, where he again posted his\nfield pieces, in readiness for action.\n\nLooking round the field, Clive saw that two of the divisions which\nformed the arc of the circle were marching back towards the\nintrenchments; but that the third, that on the left of their line, had\nwheeled round and was marching towards the rear of the grove. Not\nhaving received the letter which Meer Jaffier had written to him, he\nsupposed that this movement indicated an intention to attack his\nbaggage; and he therefore detached some European troops, with a field\ngun, to check the advance. Upon the gun opening fire, the enemy's\ndivision halted. It ceased its advance, but continued apart from the\nrest of the enemy. In the meantime, Clive had arrived upon the mound\nwhich Saint Frais had left; and, planting his guns there, opened fire\nupon the enemy within their intrenchments.\n\nThe Indian soldiers and inferior officers, knowing nothing of the\ntreachery of their chiefs, were indignant at being thus cannonaded in\ntheir intrenchments by a foe so inferior in strength; and horse, foot,\nand artillery poured out again from the intrenchments, and attacked\nthe British.\n\nThe battle now raged in earnest. Clive posted half his infantry and\nartillery on the mound of the tank nearest to the enemy's\nintrenchments, and the greater part of the rest on rising ground, two\nhundred yards to the left of it; while he placed a hundred and sixty\npicked shots, Europeans and natives, behind the tank close to the\nintrenchments, with orders to keep up a continuous musketry fire upon\nthe enemy, as they sallied out.\n\nThe enemy fought bravely. Saint Frais worked his guns unflinchingly at\nthe redoubt, the infantry poured in volley after volley, the cavalry\nmade desperate charges right up to the British lines. But they had no\nleader, and were fighting against men well commanded, and confident in\nthemselves. Clive observed that the division on the enemy's extreme\nleft remained inactive, and detached from the army; and it, for the\nfirst time, struck him that this was the division of Meer Jaffier.\nRelieved for the safety of his baggage, and from the attack which had\nhitherto threatened in his rear, he at once determined to carry the\nhill in advance of Saint Frais's battery, and the redoubt occupied by\nthe French leader.\n\nStrong columns were sent against each position. The hill was carried\nwithout opposition, and then so heavy and searching a fire was poured\ninto the intrenched camp that the enemy began to fall back, in utter\nconfusion. Saint Frais, finding himself isolated and alone in the\nredoubt, as he had before been on the mound, was forced to retire.\n\nAt five o'clock the battle was over, and the camp of the Nabob of\nBengal in the possession of the English. The British loss was\ntrifling. Seven European and sixteen native soldiers were killed,\nthirteen Europeans and thirty-six natives wounded. It was one of the\ndecisive battles of the world, for the fate of India hung in the\nbalance. Had Clive been defeated, and his force annihilated, as it\nmust have been if beaten, the English would have been swept out of\nBengal. The loss of that presidency would have had a decided effect on\nthe struggle in Madras, where the British were, with the greatest\ndifficulty, maintaining themselves against the French.\n\nHenceforth Bengal, the richest province in India, belonged to the\nEnglish; for although, for a time, they were content to recognize Meer\nJaffier and his successors as its nominal rulers, these were but\npuppets in their hands, and they were virtual masters of the province.\n\nAfter the battle, Meer Jaffier arrived. Conscious of his own\ndouble-dealing, he by no means felt sure of the reception he should\nmeet with. It suited Clive, however, to ignore the doubtful part he\nhad played, and he was saluted as Nabob of Bengal.\n\nIt would have been far better for him, had he remained one of the\ngreat chiefs of Bengal. The enormous debt, with which Clive and his\ncolleagues had saddled him, crushed him. The sum was so vast that it\nwas only by imposing the most onerous taxation upon his people that he\nwas enabled to pay it, and the discontent excited proved his\ndestruction.\n\nOmichund had no greater reason for satisfaction, at the part which he\nhad played in the ruin of his country. The fact that he had been\ndeceived, by the forged treaty, was abruptly and brutally communicated\nto him; and the blow broke his heart. He shortly afterwards became\ninsane, and died before eighteen months were over.\n\nSuraja Dowlah fled to Moorshedabad, where the remnants of his army\nfollowed him. At first, the nabob endeavoured to secure their fidelity\nby issuing a considerable amount of pay. Then, overpowered by his\nfears of treachery, he sent off the ladies of the zenana, and all his\ntreasures, on elephants; and, a few hours afterwards, he himself,\naccompanied by his favourite wife, and a slave with a casket of his\nmost valuable jewels, fled in disguise.\n\nA boat had been prepared, and lay in readiness at the wharf of the\npalace. Rowing day and night against the stream, the boat reached\nRajmahal, ninety miles distant, on the night of the fourth day\nfollowing his flight. Here the rowers were so knocked up, by their\nexertions, that it was impossible to proceed further; and they took\nrefuge in a deserted hut, by the bank.\n\nThe following morning, however, they were seen by a fakir, whose ears\nthe young tyrant had had cut off, thirteen months previously; and this\nman, recognizing the nabob even in his disguise, at once took the news\nto Meer Jaffier's brother, who happened to reside in the town. The\nlatter immediately sent a party of his retainers, who captured the\nnabob without difficulty. He was again placed in the boat, and taken\nback to Moorshedabad, where he was led into the presence of Meer\nJaffier.\n\nThe wretched young man implored the mercy of his triumphant successor,\nthe man who owed station and rank and wealth to his grandfather; and\nwho had, nevertheless, betrayed him to the English. His entreaties so\nfar moved Meer Jaffier that he was irresolute, for a time, as to the\ncourse he should pursue. His son, however, Mirav, a youth of about the\nsame age as the deposed nabob, insisted that it was folly to show\nmercy; as Meer Jaffier would never be safe, so long as Suraja Dowlah\nremained alive; and his father, at last, assigned the captive to his\nkeeping, knowing well what the result would be.\n\nIn the night, Suraja Dowlah was murdered. His mangled remains were, in\nthe morning, placed on an elephant, and exposed to the gaze of the\npopulace and soldiery.\n\nSuraja Dowlah was undoubtedly a profligate and rapacious tyrant. In\nthe course of a few months, he alienated his people, and offended a\ngreat number of his most powerful chiefs. The war which he undertook\nagainst the English, although at the moment unprovoked, must still be\nregarded as a patriotic one; and, had he not soiled his victory by the\nmassacre of the prisoners, which he first permitted and then approved,\nthe English would have had no just cause of complaint against him.\n\nFrom the day of the arrival of Clive at Calcutta, he was doomed. It is\ncertain that the nabob would not have remained faithful to his\nengagements, when the danger which wrung the concessions from him had\npassed. Nevertheless, the whole of the circumstances which followed\nthe signature of the treaty, the manner in which the unhappy youth was\nalternately cajoled and bullied to his ruin, the loathsome treachery\nin which those around him engaged, with the connivance of the English;\nand, lastly, the murder in cold blood, which Meer Jaffier, our\ncreature, was allowed to perpetrate; rendered the whole transaction\none of the blackest in the annals of English history.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24. Mounted Infantry.\n\n\nA few days after Plassey, Colonel Clive sent for Charlie.\n\n\"Marryat,\" he said, \"I must send you back, with two hundred men, to\nMadras. The governor there has been writing to me, by every ship which\nhas come up the coast, begging me to move down with the bulk of the\nforce, as soon as affairs are a little settled here. That is out of\nthe question. There are innumerable matters to be arranged. Meer\nJaffier must be sustained. The French under Law must be driven\nentirely out of Bengal. The Dutch must be dealt with. Altogether, I\nhave need of every moment of my time, and of every man under my\norders, for at least two years.\n\n\"However, I shall at once raise a Bengal native army, and so release\nthe Sepoys of Madras. If there be any special and sore need, I must,\nof course, denude myself here of troops, to succour Madras; but I hope\nit will not come to that. In the meantime, I propose that you shall\ntake back two hundred of the Madras Europeans. Lawrence will be glad\nto have you, and your chances of fighting are greater there than they\nwill be here. Bengal is overawed, and so long as I maintain the force\nI now have, it is unlikely in the extreme to rise; whereas battles and\nsieges, great and small, are the normal condition of Madras.\"\n\nThe next day Charlie, with two hundred European troops, marched down\ntowards Calcutta. Clive had told him to select any officer he pleased\nto accompany him, as second in command; and he chose Peters, who,\nseeing that there were likely to be far more exciting times in Madras\nthan in Bengal at present, was very glad to accompany him. Three days\nafter reaching Calcutta, Charlie and his party embarked on board a\nship, which conveyed them without adventure to Madras.\n\nThe authorities were glad, indeed, of the reinforcement; for the\ncountry was disturbed from end to end. Since the departure of every\navailable man for Calcutta, the Company had been able to afford but\nlittle aid to Muhammud Ali, and the authority of the latter had\ndwindled to a mere shadow, in the Carnatic. The Mahrattas made\nincursions in all directions. The minor chiefs revolted and refused to\npay tribute, and many of them entered into alliance with the French.\nDisorder everywhere reigned in the Carnatic, and Trichinopoli was,\nagain, the one place which Muhammud Ali held.\n\nThe evening after landing, Charlie Marryat had a long chat with\nColonel Lawrence; who, after explaining to him exactly the condition\nof affairs in the country, asked him to tell him, frankly, what\ncommand he would like to receive.\n\n\"I have thought for some time,\" Charlie said, \"that the establishment\nof a small force of really efficient cavalry, trained to act as\ninfantry, also, would be invaluable. The Mahratta horsemen, by their\nrapid movements, set our infantry in defiance; and the native horse of\nour allies are useless against them. I am convinced that two hundred\nhorsemen, trained and drilled like our cavalry at home, would ride\nthrough any number of them. In a country like this, where every petty\nrajah has his castle, cavalry alone could, however, do little. They\nmust be able to act as infantry, and should have a couple of little\nfour-pounders to take about with them. A force like this would do more\nto keep order in the Carnatic than one composed of infantry, alone, of\nten times its strength. It could act as a police force, call upon\npetty chiefs who refuse to pay their share of the revenue, restore\norder in disturbed places, and permit the peasants to carry on their\nagricultural work, upon which the revenue of the Company depends; and,\naltogether, render valuable services.\n\n\"Among the soldiers who came down with me is a sergeant who was at one\ntime a trooper in an English regiment. He exchanged to come out with\nthe 39th to India, and has again exchanged into the Company's service.\nI would make him drill instructor, if you will give him a commission\nas ensign. Peters I should like as my second in command; and, if you\napprove of the plan, I should be very much obliged if you would get\nhim his step as captain. He's a good officer, but has not had such\nluck as I have.\"\n\nColonel Lawrence was very much pleased at the idea, and gave Charlie\nfull authority to carry it out. The work of enlistment at once\ncommenced. Hossein made an excellent recruiting sergeant. He went into\nthe native bazaars; and by telling of the exploits of Charlie at Ambur\nand Suwarndrug, and holding out bright prospects of the plunder which\nsuch a force would be likely to obtain, he succeeded in recruiting a\nhundred and fifty of his co-religionists. In those days, fighting was\na trade in India; and in addition to the restless spirits of the local\ncommunities, great numbers of the hardy natives of northern India,\nAfghans, Pathans, and others, were scattered over India, ever ready to\nenlist in the service of the highest bidder. Among such men as these,\nHossein had no difficulty in obtaining a hundred and fifty picked\nhorsemen.\n\nCharlie had determined that his force should consist of four troops,\neach of fifty strong. Of these one would be composed of Europeans, and\nhe was permitted to take this number from the party he had brought\ndown. He had no difficulty in obtaining volunteers, for as soon as the\nnature of the force was known, the men were eager to engage in it. To\nthis troop, the two little field pieces would be committed.\n\nA few days after the scheme had been sanctioned, Ensign Anstey was at\nwork drilling the recruits as cavalry. Charlie and Peters were\ninstructed by him, also, in the drill and words of command, and were\nsoon able to assist. Two months were spent in severe work and, at the\nend of that time, the little regiment were able to execute all simple\ncavalry manoeuvres with steadiness and regularity. The natives were\nall men who had lived on horseback from their youth, and therefore\nrequired no teaching to ride.\n\nThey were also, at the end of that time, able to act as infantry, with\nas much regularity as the ordinary Sepoys. When so engaged, four\nhorses were held by one man, so that a hundred and fifty men were\navailable for fighting on foot.\n\nThe work had been unusually severe, but as the officers did not spare\nthemselves, and Charlie had promised a present to each man of the\ntroop, when fit for service, they had worked with alacrity, and had\ntaken great interest in learning their new duties. At the end of two\nmonths, they were inspected by Colonel Lawrence and Governor Pigot,\nand both expressed their highest gratification and surprise at their\nefficiency, and anticipated great benefits would arise from the\norganization.\n\nSo urgent, indeed, was the necessity that something should be done for\nthe restoration of order, that Charlie had with difficulty obtained\nthe two months necessary to attain the degree of perfection which he\ndeemed necessary.\n\nThe day after the inspection, the troop marched out from Madras.\nEnsign Anstey commanded the white troop, the other three were led by\nnative officers. Captain Peters commanded the squadron composed of the\nwhite troop and one of the others. A Lieutenant Hallowes, whom Peters\nknew to be a hard working and energetic officer, was, at Charlie's\nrequest, appointed to the command of the other squadron. He himself\ncommanded the whole.\n\nThey had been ordered, in the first place, to move to Arcot, which was\nheld by a garrison of Muhammud Ali. The whole of the country around\nwas greatly disturbed. French intrigues, and the sight of the\ndiminished power of the English, had caused most of the minor chiefs\nin that neighbourhood to throw off their allegiance. A body of\nMahratta horse were ravaging the country districts; and it was against\nthese that Charlie determined, in the first place, to act.\n\nHe had been permitted to have his own way in the clothing and arming\nof his force. Each man carried a musket, which had been shortened some\nsix inches, and hung in slings from the saddle, the muzzle resting in\na piece of leather, technically termed a bucket. The ammunition pouch\nwas slung on the other side of the saddle, and could be fastened in an\ninstant, by two straps, to the belts which the troopers wore round\ntheir waists. The men were dressed in brown, thick cotton cloth,\ncalled karkee. Round their black forage caps was wound a long length\nof blue and white cotton cloth, forming a turban, with the ends\nhanging down to protect the back of the neck and spine from the sun.\n\nHaving obtained news that the Mahratta horse, two thousand strong,\nwere pillaging at a distance of six miles from the town, Charlie set\noff the day following his arrival to meet them. The Mahrattas had\nnotice of his coming; but hearing that the force consisted only of two\nhundred horse, they regarded it with contempt.\n\nWhen Charlie first came upon them they were in the open country; and,\nseeing that they were prepared to attack him, he drew up his little\nforce in two lines. The second line he ordered to dismount, to act as\ninfantry. The two guns were loaded with grape, and the men of the\nfirst line were drawn up at sufficient intervals to allow an\ninfantryman to pass between each horse.\n\nWith shouts of anticipated triumph, the Mahratta horse swept down. The\nfront line of English horsemen had screened the movements of those\nbehind, and when the enemy were within fifty yards, Charlie gave the\nword. The troopers already sat, musket in hand, and between each horse\nan infantry soldier now stepped forward; while towards each end, the\nline opened and the two field pieces were advanced.\n\nThe Mahratta horsemen were astonished at this sudden manoeuvre; but,\npressed by the mass from behind, they still continued their charge.\nWhen but fifteen yards from the English line, a stream of fire ran\nalong this, from end to end. Every musket was emptied into the\nadvancing force, while the guns on either flank swept them with grape.\n\nThe effect was tremendous. Scarcely a man of the front line survived\nthe fire, and the whole mass halted, and recoiled in confusion. Before\nthey could recover themselves, another volley of shot and grape was\nfired into them. Then Charlie's infantry ran back; and the cavalry,\nclosing up, dashed upon the foe, followed half a minute afterwards by\nthe lately dismounted men of the other two troops; ten white soldiers,\nalone, remaining to work and guard the guns.\n\nThe effect of the charge of these two hundred disciplined horse, upon\nthe already disorganized mob of Mahratta horsemen, was irresistible;\nand in a few minutes the Mahrattas were scattered, and in full flight\nover the plain, pursued by the British cavalry, now broken up into\neight half troops. The rout was complete, and in a very short time the\nlast Mahratta had fled, leaving behind them three hundred dead upon\nthe plain.\n\nGreatly gratified with their success; and feeling confident, now, in\ntheir own powers, the British force returned to Arcot.\n\nCharlie now determined to attack the fort of Vellore, which was\nregarded as impregnable. The town lay at the foot of some very steep\nand rugged hills, which were surmounted by three detached forts. The\nrajah, encouraged by the French, had renounced his allegiance to\nMuhammud Ali, and had declared himself independent. As, however, it\nwas certain that he was prepared to give assistance to the French,\nwhen they took the field against the English, Charlie determined to\nattack the place.\n\nThe French had received large reinforcements, and had already captured\nmany forts and strong places, around Pondicherry. They were, however,\nawaiting the arrival of still larger forces, known to be on the way,\nbefore they made a decisive and, as they hoped, final attack upon the\nEnglish.\n\nThe rajah's army consisted of some fifteen hundred infantry, and as\nmany cavalry. These advanced to meet the English force. Charlie\nfeigned a retreat, as they came on; and retired to a village, some\nthirty miles distant. The cavalry pursued at full speed, leaving the\ninfantry behind.\n\nUpon reaching the village, Charlie at once dismounted all his men,\nlined the inclosures, and received the enemy's cavalry, as they\ngalloped up, with so heavy a fire that they speedily drew rein. After\ntrying for some time to force the position, they began to fall back;\nand the English force again mounted, dashed upon them, and completed\ntheir defeat. The broken horsemen, as they rode across the plain, met\ntheir infantry advancing; and these, disheartened at the defeat of the\ncavalry, fell back in great haste; and, abandoning the town, which was\nwithout fortification, retired at once to the forts commanding it.\n\nCharlie took possession of the town, and spent the next two days in\nreconnoitering the forts. The largest, and nearest, of these faced the\nright of the town. It was called Suzarow. The second, on an even\nsteeper hill, was called Guzarow. The third, which lay some distance\nbehind this, and was much smaller, was called Mortz Azur.\n\nCharlie determined to attempt, in the first place, to carry Guzarow;\nas in this, which was considered the most inaccessible, the rajah\nhimself had taken up his position, having with him all his treasure.\nCharlie saw that it would be next to impossible, with so small a\nforce, to carry it by a direct attack, by the road which led to it, as\nthis was completely covered by its guns. It appeared to him, however,\nthat the rocks upon which it stood were, by no means, inaccessible.\n\nHe left twenty men to guard his guns, placed a guard of ten upon the\nroad leading up to the fort, to prevent the inhabitants from sending\nup news of his intentions to the garrison, who had, with that of\nSuzarow, kept up a fire from their guns upon the town, since his\narrival there. The moon was not to rise until eleven o'clock, and at\nnine Charlie marched, with a hundred and seventy men, from the town.\nMaking a considerable detour, he found himself, at half past ten, at\nthe foot of the rocks, rising almost sheer from the upper part of the\nhill.\n\nHe was well provided with ropes and ladders. The most perfect silence\nhad been enjoined upon the men and, in the darkness, the march had\nbeen unseen by the enemy. While waiting for the moon to rise, the\ntroopers all wound pieces of cloth, with which they had come provided,\nround their boots, to prevent these from making a noise, by slipping\nor stumbling on the rocks.\n\nWhen the moon rose, the ascent of the rocks began at the point which\nCharlie had, after a close inspection through a telescope, judged to\nbe most accessible. The toil was very severe. One by one, the men\nclimbed from ledge to ledge, some of the most active hill men, from\nnorthern India, leading the way, and aiding their comrades to follow\nthem, by lowering ropes, and placing ladders at the most inaccessible\nspots. All this time, they were completely hidden from the observation\nof the garrison, above.\n\nAt last, the leaders of the party stood at the foot of the walls,\nwhich rose a few feet from the edge of the cliff. The operation had\nbeen performed almost noiselessly. The ammunition pouches had been\nleft behind, each man carrying ten rounds in his belt. Every piece of\nmetal had been carefully removed from their uniforms, the very buttons\nhaving been cut off, lest these should strike against the rocks; and\nthe muskets had been swathed up in thick coverings.\n\nThe men, as they gained the upper ridge, spread along at the foot of\nthe walls, until the whole body had gathered there. They could hear\nthe voices of the sentries, thirty feet above them; but these, having\nno idea of the vicinity of an enemy, did not look over the edge of the\nwall. Indeed, the parapets of the Indian fortifications were always so\nhigh, that it was only from projecting towers that the foot of the\nwall could be seen.\n\nWhen the English force were assembled, the ladders, which, like\neverything else, had been muffled, were placed against the walls; and,\nheaded by their officers, the troops ascended. The surprise was\ncomplete. Not until the leaders of the storming party stood upon the\nparapet was their presence perceived. The guards discharged their\nfirelocks, and fled hastily.\n\nAs soon as twenty men were collected on the wall, Charlie took the\ncommand of these, and hurried forward towards the gate. Hallowes was\nto lead the next party along the opposite direction. Peters was to\nform the rest up, as they gained the wall, and to follow Charlie with\nfifty more; while Anstey was to hold the remainder in reserve, to be\nused as circumstances might demand.\n\nThe resistance, however, was slight. Taken absolutely by surprise, the\nenemy rushed out from their sleeping places. They were immediately\nfired upon from the walls. The greater part ran back into shelter,\nwhile some of the more determined, gathering together, made for the\ngate. But of this Charlie had already taken possession, and received\nthem with so vigorous a fire that they speedily fell back.\n\nWhen the whole circuit of the walls was in his possession, Charlie\ntook a hundred of his men, and descended into the fort. Each building,\nas he reached it, was searched; and the garrison it contained made to\ncome out, and lay down their arms, and were then allowed to depart\nthrough the gate.\n\nUpon reaching the rajah's quarters, he at once came out and\nsurrendered himself. Two guns were discharged, to inform the little\nbody in the town of the complete success of the movement; and the\nguard on the road then fell back, and joined the party with the guns.\n\nThus, without losing a man, the fort of Guzarow, regarded by the\nnatives as being impregnable, was carried. Fifteen lacs of rupees were\nfound in the treasury. Of these, in accordance with the rules of the\nservice, half was set aside for the Company, the remainder became the\nproperty of the force. Of this half fell to the officers, in\nproportion to their rank, and the rest was divided among the men. The\nshare of each trooper amounted to nearly two hundred pounds.\n\nKnowing how demoralizing the possession of such a sum would be,\nCharlie assembled his force next morning. He pointed out to them that,\nas the greater part of the plunder was in silver, it would be\nimpossible for them to carry it on their persons. He advised them,\nthen, to allow the whole sum to remain in the treasury, to be\nforwarded under an escort to Madras; each soldier to receive an order,\nfor the amount of his share, upon the treasury there. This was agreed\nto, unanimously, and Charlie then turned his attention to the other\nforts.\n\nThe guns of Guzarow were turned against these, and a bombardment\ncommenced. Suzarow, which extended partly down the slope, was much\nexposed to the fire from Guzarow; and although no damage could be done\nto the walls at so great a distance, the garrison, suffering from the\nfire, and intimidated by the fall of Guzarow, lost heart. Large\nnumbers deserted, and the governor, in the course of two days, thought\nit prudent to obey the orders which the rajah had, upon being made\ncaptive, sent to him to surrender. The next day the governor of Mortz\nAzur followed his example; and Vellore, and its three strong forts,\nwere thus in the possession of the English.\n\nAt Vellore, Charlie nearly lost one of his faithful followers. Early\nin the morning, Hossein came into Charlie's room.\n\n\"Sahib,\" he said, \"something is the matter with Tim.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" Charlie said, sitting up in his bed.\n\n\"I do not know, sahib. When I went to him, he did not move. He was\nwide awake, and his eyes are staring. When I went beside him, he shook\nhis head a little, and said, 'S-s-s-h.' He seems quite rigid, and is\nas pale as death.\"\n\nCharlie leaped out, and hurried to Tim. The latter was lying on the\nground, in the next room. He had carried off three or four cushions,\nfrom the rajah's divan, and had thrown these down, and had spread a\nrug over him. He lay on his back, exactly as Hossein had described.\n\nAs Charlie hurried up, Tim again gave vent to the warning \"S-s-s-h.\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Tim? What is the matter, my poor fellow?\"\n\nTim made a slight motion, with his head, for his master to bend\ntowards him. Charlie leant over him, and he whispered:\n\n\"There is a sarpent in bed with me.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure, Tim?\"\n\n\"He woke me with his cold touch,\" Tim whispered. \"I felt him crawling\nagainst my foot, and now he is laying against my leg.\"\n\nCharlie drew back for a minute, and consulted with Hossein.\n\n\"Lie quite still, Tim,\" he said, \"and don't be afraid. We will try to\nkill him, without his touching you; but even if he should bite you,\nwith help ready at hand, there will be no danger.\"\n\nCharlie now procured two knives; the one a sharp surgical knife, from\na case which he had brought; the other he placed in a charcoal fire,\nwhich one of the men speedily fanned, until the blade had attained a\nwhite heat. Charlie had decided that, if the snake bit Tim, he would\ninstantly make a deep cut through the line of the puncture of the\nfangs, cutting down as low as these could penetrate, and immediately\ncauterize it, by placing the hot knife in the gash so made. Six men\nwere called in, with orders to seize Tim on the instant, and hold his\nleg firm, to enable the operation to be performed. Two others were to\noccupy themselves with the snake. These were armed with sticks.\n\nHossein now approached the bed, from which, hitherto, they had all\nkept well aloof. The snake, Tim said, lay against his leg, between the\nknee and the ankle, and the spot was marked by a slight elevation of\nthe rug.\n\nHossein drew his tulwar, examined the edge to see that nothing had\nblunted its razor-like keenness, and then took his stand at the foot\nof the bed. Twice he raised his weapon; and then let it fall, with a\ndrawing motion. The keen blade cut through the rug, as if it had been\npasteboard; and, at the same instant, Tim sprang from the other side\nof the bed, and fainted in the arms of the men. Hossein threw off the\nrug, and there, severed in pieces, lay the writhing body of a huge\ncobra.\n\nTim soon recovered, under the administration of water sprinkled in his\nface, and brandy poured down his throat. But he was some time, ere he\nthoroughly recovered from the effects of the trying ordeal through\nwhich he had passed. Many of the buildings in the fort were in a very\nbad condition, and Charlie had several of the most dilapidated\ndestroyed, finding in their walls several colonies of cobras, which\nwere all killed by the troops.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25. Besieged In A Pagoda.\n\n\nA few days later Charlie received a message from the Rajah of\nPermacoil, saying that he was besieged by a strong native force, aided\nby the French. He at once moved his force to his assistance. He found\nthat the besiegers, among whom were two hundred French troops, were\ntoo strong to be attacked. He therefore established himself in their\nrear, attacked and captured convoys, and prevented the country people\nfrom bringing in provisions. Several times the besieging infantry\nadvanced against him, but before these he at once fell back, only to\nreturn as soon as they retired to their camp. Whenever their horse\nventured out against him, he beat them back, with considerable loss.\n\nTen days after his arrival, the enemy, finding it impossible to\nmaintain themselves in the face of so active an enemy, and suffering\ngreatly from want of provisions, raised the siege and fell back.\n\nAs soon as they had drawn off, Charlie entered the fort. The rajah\nreceived him with the greatest warmth. He was, however, much\ndistressed at the capture of a hill fort, at some distance from\nPermacoil. In this he had stowed his wives and treasure, thinking that\nit would be unmolested. The French, however, had, just before\nCharlie's arrival, detached a strong force with some guns, and these\nhad captured the place. The force which had accomplished this had, he\nnow heard, marched to Trinavody, a fort and town thirty miles away,\nupon the road by which the force which had besieged the town was\nretiring. The treasure was a considerable one, amounting to seven lacs\nof rupees, and as the rajah stated his willingness that the troops\nshould take possession of this, if they could but rescue his women,\nCharlie at once determined to attempt the feat.\n\nThe main body of the enemy would not reach the place, until the\nafternoon of the following day. Charlie soon collected his men and,\nmaking a detour through the country, arrived next morning within a\nmile of Trinavody.\n\nThe town was a small one, and the fort one of the ordinary native\nforts, built in a parallelogram with flanking towers. The place,\nhowever, contained a very large and solidly built pagoda or temple. It\nwas surrounded by a wall, forty feet high; and at the gateway stood an\nimmense tower, with terraces rising one above the other.\n\nCapturing a native, Charlie learnt that the fort was tenanted only by\nthe troops of the native rajah of the place, the French detachment\nbeing encamped in the pagoda. He at once rode forward with his troops,\ndashed through the native town, and in through the wide gateway of the\ntower, into the courtyard within. Beyond two or three straggling shots\nfrom the sentries, he had so far encountered no opposition, and the\nnative troops in the courtyard, thrown into wild confusion by this\nsudden appearance of a hostile force, threw down their arms and cried\nfor mercy. From the temple within, however, the French infantry, a\nhundred strong, opened a brisk fire.\n\nCharlie sent some of his men on to the tower, whence their fire\ncommanded the flat roof of the temple, and these speedily drove the\ndefenders from that post. The field pieces were unlimbered, and\ndirected towards the gate of the inner temple, while a musketry fire\nwas kept up against every window and loophole in the building. The\ngate gave way after a few shots had been fired, and Charlie led his\nparty to the assault.\n\nThe French defended themselves bravely, but they were outnumbered and\nwere driven, fighting, from room to room, until the survivors laid\ndown their arms. The assault, however, had cost the British a loss of\ntwenty-five men.\n\nThe Rajah of Permacoil's treasure, and his women, fell into the hands\nof the captors. Charlie ordered the chests to be brought down, and\nplaced in bullock waggons. Just as he was about to order his men, who\nwere scattered through the temple looting, to form up, he heard a\nshout from the tower; and, looking up, saw one of his men there\ngesticulating wildly. He ran up the tower, and on reaching the first\nterrace saw, to his surprise, the whole of the force which he believed\nto be fifteen miles distant, already entering the town.\n\nThe French officer in command, knowing the activity and dash of his\nopponent, and fearing that an attempt might be made to carry Trinavody\nand recapture the rajah's treasure, had marched all night. When within\na mile of the place, he heard what had happened, and at once pushed\nforward.\n\nCharlie saw that, already, his retreat was cut off; and, running to\nthe edge of the terrace, shouted to Peters to hurry out with all the\nmen already in the courtyard, to occupy the houses outside the gate,\nand to keep back the advancing enemy. Summoning another party to the\ntower, four guns upon the terrace were at once loaded, and these\nopened upon the head of the enemy's column, as they entered the street\nleading to the temple.\n\nIn a short time, a brisk fight began. The enemy planted guns to bear\nupon the tower. The cannon of the fort joined in the assault, the\ninfantry pressed forward through the houses and inclosures to the\ntemple, and were soon engaged with the men under Captain Peters, while\nthe guns and musketry from the tower also opened upon them.\n\nHaving seen that the preparations to repulse an immediate attack were\ncomplete, Charlie again ran down to the courtyard. The weak point of\nthe defences was the gateway. This was fifty feet wide, and unprovided\nwith gates; and Charlie at once set a strong party to work, to form a\nbarricade across it.\n\nFor some hours, the party outside the gates maintained their position,\nbut they were gradually driven back; and towards evening, by Charlie's\norders, they retired within the temple. The barricade was now eight\nfeet high. The face was formed of large slabs of stone, piled one upon\nanother, backed by a considerable thickness of earthwork. This,\nhowever, although capable of resisting a sudden rush of infantry,\nwould, Charlie knew, be incapable of resisting artillery.\n\nDuring the night, he divided his men in two parties, which alternately\nslept and worked at the inner defences which he had designed. These\nconsisted of two walls, running from each side of the gateway to the\ntemple. They were placed a few feet farther back than the edge of the\ngateway, so that an enemy advancing to the storm would not see them,\nuntil within the gate. These walls he intended to be eight feet high;\nand to be backed with earth, four feet high, so as to form a bank on\nwhich the defenders could stand, and fire into the space between them.\nTo obtain materials, he pulled down several buildings forming a part\nof the temple. The distance from the gateway to the temple was fifty\nyards, and although the men worked without ceasing, the wall had made\nbut little progress when daylight dawned.\n\nDuring the night, Charlie lowered one of his men from the wall\nfarthest from the enemy; with instructions to make his way, as fast as\npossible, to Madras to ask for succour. In the morning, Charlie found\nthat the enemy had, on their side, been also busy. A house, which\nfaced the end of the street leading to the temple, had been pulled\ndown; and a battery of four guns erected there.\n\nAs soon as it was light, the combat began. The enemy had sixteen\npieces of artillery, besides those on the fort; and while the four\nguns in front played unceasingly upon the barricade across the\ngateway, the others cannonaded the tower, whence the English guns kept\nup a fire on the battery in front. So well were these directed, and so\nheavy was the musketry, that the enemy's guns were several times\nsilenced, and the artillerymen driven from them.\n\nBehind the barricade, a working party threw up fresh earth, to\nstrengthen the part most shaken by the enemy's fire, and then set to\nwork to form a similar barricade, in a line with the back of the\ngateway. This was completed by nightfall, by which time the enemy's\nguns had completely shattered the stone facing of the outer barricade,\nrendering it possible for it to be carried with a rush. As, from the\nwindows of the houses, they could see the new work behind it; they\nwould, Charlie judged, not attempt an assault, until this also was\ndestroyed.\n\nDuring the night, large quantities of fresh earth were piled on the\nouter barricade, which was now useful as forming a screen to that\nbehind it from the guns. All night the work at the parallel walls\ncontinued, and by morning these had reached a height of three feet.\n\nDuring the next two days the fight continued, without much advantage\non either side. Each day the enemy's guns shattered the outer\nbarricade, but this was as regularly repaired at night, in spite of\nthe heavy artillery and matchlock fire which they kept up towards the\nspot.\n\nOn the fourth day the enemy pulled down a house, standing just in the\nrear of their battery, and Charlie found that behind it they had\nerected another. It was a solidly built work, of fifteen feet in\nheight, and the enemy must have laboured continuously at it, every\nnight. It had a strong and high parapet, of sandbags, protecting the\ngunners from the musketry fire of the tower. The muzzles of four guns\nprojected through embrasures, which had been left for them, and these\nopened fire over the heads of the gunners in the lower battery.\n\nIn spite of the efforts of the besieged, the enemy kept up so heavy a\nfire that, by the afternoon, the inner as well as the outer barricade\nwas knocked to pieces. By this time, however, the inner walls were\ncompleted, and the English awaited the storm with confidence. The\ndoorway of the temple had been closed, and blocked up behind; but the\ndoors had been shattered to pieces, by the shot which had passed\nthrough the gateway, and the entrance now stood open.\n\nInside the temple, out of the line of fire, Charlie had the two little\nfield pieces, each crammed to the muzzle with bullets, placed in\nreadiness to fire. The lower floor of the tower had been pierced,\nabove the gateway, and here two huge caldrons filled with boiling\nlead, stripped from the roof, stood ready for action.\n\nAt three in the afternoon, after a furious cannonade, the fire of the\nenemy's battery suddenly ceased. They had formed communications\nbetween the houses, on either side of the street; and, at the signal,\nthe troops poured out from these in large bodies, and rushed to the\nassault.\n\nThe guns from the tower, which had been awaiting the moment, poured\nshowers of grape among them; but, believing that the temple now lay at\ntheir mercy, the enemy did not hesitate, but rushed at the gateway.\n\nNot a shot was fired, as they entered. Scrambling over the remains of\nthe two barricades, the enemy poured with exulting shouts into the\ncourtyard. Then those in front hesitated. On either hand, as far as\nthe doorway of the temple, extended a massive wall, eight feet high;\nroughly built, certainly, but far too strong to be battered down, too\nsteep to be scaled. They would have retreated, but they were driven\nforward by the mass which poured in through the gateway behind them;\nand, seeing that their only safety was in victory, they pressed\nforward again.\n\nNot a defender showed himself, until the head of the column had\nreached a point two-thirds of the distance across the courtyard. Then\nsuddenly, on either side, the wall was lined by the British, who at\nonce opened a tremendous fire on the mass below. At the same moment,\nthe guns were run into the doorway, and poured their contents into the\nstruggling mass.\n\nPent up between the walls, unable to return the fire poured down upon\nthem, with lanes torn through them by the discharge of the cannon, the\ngreater portion of the mass strove to turn and retire. The officer in\ncommand, a gallant Frenchman, called upon the survivors of the fifty\nFrench infantry, who had led the attack, to follow him; and rushed\nforward upon the guns. Here, however, Charlie had posted his\nEuropeans, and these, swarming out from the temple, poured a volley\ninto the advancing French, and then charged them with the bayonet.\n\nThe pressure from behind had now ceased. Streams of boiling lead,\npoured through the holes above the archway, had effectually checked\nthe advance; and through this molten shower, the shattered remnants of\nthe assaulting column now fled for their lives, leaving two hundred\nand fifty of their best men dead behind them.\n\nAs the last of the column issued out, the guns of the battery again\nangrily opened fire. As Charlie had anticipated, the enemy, finding\nhow strong were the inner defences, abandoned all further idea of\nattack by the gateway; and, leaving only two guns there to prevent a\nsortie, placed their whole artillery on the western side of the\npagoda, and opened fire to prepare a breach there.\n\nFor a week the siege continued, and then Charlie determined to\nevacuate the place. The rajah's treasure was made up into small sacks,\nwhich were fastened to the horses' croups. Had it not been for these\nanimals, he would have defended the place to the last, confident in\nhis power to devise fresh means to repel fresh assaults. The store of\nforage, however, collected by the enemy for their own use in the\ntemple, was now exhausted. Charlie directed Peters, with twenty men,\nto sally out from the gate at midnight, to enter the nearest house on\nthe right hand side, and to follow the communications made by the\nenemy before the assault, until they came to the end of the street.\nLieutenant Hallowes, with a similar party, was to take the left side.\nIf they found any guards within the houses, they were to overpower\nthese; and, rushing straight on, to attack the battery, and spike the\nguns. Should they find the houses deserted, they were to gather in the\nhouses nearest the battery, when Peters was to fire his pistol as a\nsignal to Hallowes, and both parties were to attack the battery.\n\nOne of the inner walls had been pulled down, and the main body of the\nforce, having the wounded and the ladies of the rajah's zenana in\ntheir centre, were to sally out, the instant the guns were taken.\n\nThe plan was carried out with the greatest success. The houses on both\nsides of the street were found to be deserted, and as Peters fired his\npistol, the party dashed at the flanks of the battery. The French\ngunners leaped to their feet and, believing that they were attacked in\nfront, discharged their cannon. The grapeshot swept along the empty\nstreet, and through the gateway; and Charlie, leading one of the\ntroops, at once dashed down the street.\n\nAt their first rush, Peters and Hallowes had carried the battery,\ncutting down the gunners. Immediately behind, however, the enemy had\nposted a support, several hundred strong, and these speedily advanced\nto recover the battery.\n\nLeaving their horses in charge of a small party, Charlie dismounted\nhis men and joined Peters, and his fire quickly checked the assault.\nIn the meantime, the rest of the defenders of the temple rode down the\nstreet and, leaving a few men with the horses of Peters' and Hallowes'\ndetachments, rode out into the open country. After driving back his\nassailants, Charlie led his party back to their horses, mounted them,\nand speedily rejoined the main body. An hour later they were well on\ntheir way towards Permacoil, which they reached, next day.\n\nThe rajah was delighted at recovering his family. The treasure was\ndivided, and the portion belonging to the troops was, with the\nCompany's share, sent down under a strong escort to Madras.\n\nFor a considerable time, Charlie's force were occupied with small\nundertakings. Lally had now arrived, from France, and had taken the\ncommand. He had, at his orders, a European force considerably\nexceeding any that had hitherto been gathered in India, and he boasted\nthat he was going to capture Madras, and drive the English out of\nIndia. Nothing could have been more unfortunate for the French than\nthe choice of such a man, and his appointment was destined to give the\nlast blow to French influence in India, as the supercession of Dupleix\nhad given the first.\n\nMonsieur Lally had one virtue. He was personally brave; but he was\narrogant, passionate, and jealous. He had no capacity, whatever, for\neither awing or conciliating those with whom he came in contact. He\ntreated the natives with open contempt, and was soon as much hated, by\nthem, as by his own soldiers.\n\nHis first step had been to order Bussy down, from Hyderabad, with the\nwhole of his force. Bussy, a man of great genius, of extreme tact, of\nperfect knowledge of the Indian character; had, for eight years,\nmaintained French influence supreme at that court, and had acquired\nfor France the Northern Sirkars, a splendid and most valuable\nprovince, on the seacoast north of Madras. Salabut Jung, the ruler of\nHyderabad, the protege of the French, heard with dismay the order\nwhich Bussy had received. To Bussy himself, the blow was a heavy one,\nand he saw that his departure would entail the ruin of the edifice of\nFrench influence, which he had built up by so many years of thought\nand toil.\n\nHowever, he obeyed at once; and marched, with two hundred and fifty\nEuropeans and five hundred native troops, into the Sirkars. He made\nover the charge of this treaty to the Marquis de Conflans, whom,\nalthough but just arrived from Europe, and entirely new to Indian\naffairs, Count de Lally had sent to replace Monsieur Moracin, who had,\nfor years, ably managed the province. He then marched, with his\ntroops, to join the main army under Count de Lally.\n\nThis force, having taken Fort Saint David, had operated against\nTanjore, where it had suffered a repulse. The news of this reached the\nNorthern Sirkars, soon after the departure of Bussy; and Anandraz, the\nmost powerful chief of the country, rose in rebellion, and sent a\nmessenger to Calcutta, begging the assistance of the English to drive\nout the French.\n\nWhile the rest of the Bengal council, seeing that Bengal was, at the\ntime, threatened with invasion from the north, and menaced with\ntroubles within, considered that it would be an act little short of\nmadness to send troops, at a time when they could be so little spared,\nto assist a chief, who, even from his own accounts, was only able to\nraise three thousand irregular followers, Clive thought otherwise. He\nsaw the great value of the Northern Sirkars, whose possession would\ncomplete the line of British territory, along the seacoast, from\nCalcutta down to Madras. He saw, too, that a movement here would\neffect a diversion, in favour of Madras. The situation there appeared\nvery serious, and he could spare no troops which would suffice to turn\nthe scale. But even should Madras be lost, the gain of the Northern\nSirkars would almost compensate for the disaster.\n\nHaving gained the council to his views, he sent Lieutenant Colonel\nForde, who commanded the Company's troops in Bengal, with five hundred\nEuropeans, two thousand natives, and six six-pounders, by sea to\nVizagapatam, a port which Anandraz had seized. These landed on the\n20th of October, 1758.\n\nHad Conflans been an efficient officer, he could have crushed Anandraz\nlong before the arrival of the English. He had, under his orders, a\nforce composed of five hundred European troops, men trained by Bussy,\nand accustomed to victory; four thousand native troops, and a brigade\nof artillery. Instead of marching at once to crush the rebellion, he\nsent messenger after messenger to Lally, begging for assistance. It\nwas only when he heard, from Lally, that he had directed Moracin, with\nthree hundred European troops, to support him, that he moved against\nAnandraz.\n\nHis opportunity had, however, slipped from his hands. He had thrown\naway six weeks; and when, upon the march, the news reached him of the\nlanding of the English, he took up the very strong position within\nsight of the fort Peddapur, and intrenched himself there.\n\nClive had sent to Madras the news that he was despatching Colonel\nForde to the Sirkars, and begged that any body of troops who might be\navailable might be forwarded. Charlie's corps had already been\nrecalled towards Madras, to keep the bodies of French who were\nconverging in that direction at a distance, as long as possible, so as\nto allow the victualling of Madras to go on uninterrupted. Mr. Pigot\nnow instructed Charlie to hand over the command of that force to\nPeters; and, with fifty men, to make his way north and to effect a\njunction with Forde, who was entirely deficient in cavalry.\n\nAvoiding the French force, Charlie reached Vizagapatam upon the 2nd of\nDecember, and found that Forde had marched on the previous day. He\nstarted at once, and on the evening of the 3rd came up to Forde, who\nhad arrived in sight of the French position.\n\nCharlie had already made the acquaintance of Colonel Forde in Bengal,\nand Forde was glad to obtain the assistance, and advice, of an officer\nwho had seen so much service. An hour after arriving, Charlie rode out\nwith his commander and reconnoitred the French position; which was,\nthey concluded, too strong to be attacked. In point of numbers, the\nforces were about even. Conflans had, in addition to his five hundred\nEuropeans, six thousand native infantry, five hundred native cavalry,\nand thirty guns. Forde had four hundred and seventy Europeans, one\nthousand nine hundred Sepoys, and six guns. Anandraz had forty\nEuropeans, five thousand infantry, five hundred horsemen, and four\nguns. These five thousand men were, however, a mere ragged mob, of\nwhom very few had firearms, and the rest were armed with bows and\narrows. His horsemen were equally worthless, and Forde could only rely\nupon the troops he had brought with him from Calcutta, and the troop\nof fifty natives under Charlie Marryat.\n\nFinding that the French position was too strong to be attacked, Forde\nfell back to a strong position at Chambol, a village nearly four miles\nfrom the French camp. Here, for four days, the two armies remained\nwatching each other, the leaders of both sides considering that the\nposition of the other was too strong to be attacked.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26. The Siege Of Madras.\n\n\nAt last, weary of inactivity, the Marquis de Conflans and Colonel\nForde arrived simultaneously, on the 8th of December, at a\ndetermination to bring matters to a crisis. Conflans had heard, from a\ndeserter, that Forde had omitted to occupy a mound which, at a short\ndistance from his camp, commanded the position. He determined to seize\nthis during the night, and to open fire with his guns, and that his\nmain army should take advantage of the confusion, which the sudden\nattack would occasion, to fall upon the English. Forde, on his part,\nhad determined to march at four o'clock in the morning to a village\nnamed Condore, three miles distant, whence he could threaten the\nFrench flank.\n\nIgnorant of each other's intentions, the English and French left their\ncamps at night. Forde marched at a quarter past four, as arranged with\nAnandraz; but the rajah and his people, with the usual native aversion\nto punctuality, remained quietly asleep, and a few minutes after\ndaybreak they were roughly awakened, by a deadly fire poured by six\nguns into the camp. The rajah sent messenger after messenger to Forde,\nurging him to return; and he himself, with his frightened army,\nhurried towards Condore. Forde had, indeed, retraced his steps\nimmediately he heard the fire of the guns, and soon met the rajah's\nrabble in full flight; and, uniting with them, marched back to\nCondore.\n\nConflans supposed that the fire of his guns had driven the whole of\nhis opponents in a panic from Chambol; and, determining to take\nadvantage of the confusion, marched with his force against them. Forde\nat once prepared for the battle. In the centre he placed the English,\nincluding the rajah's forty Europeans. Next to these, on either side,\nhe placed his Sepoys, and posted the troops of Anandraz on the right\nand left flanks. He then advanced towards the enemy.\n\nThe French guns opened fire. Forde halted. In the position in which he\nfound himself, his centre occupied a field of Indian corn, so high\nthat they were concealed from the enemy. Conflans had moved towards\nthe English left, with the intention, apparently, of turning that\nflank; and after the artillery battle on both sides had continued for\nforty minutes, he ordered his troops to advance.\n\nIn Madras, both the English and French dress their Sepoys in white. In\nBengal, however, since the raising of Sepoy regiments after the\nrecapture of Calcutta, the English had clothed them in red. Conflans,\ntherefore, thought that the force he was about to attack was the\nEnglish contingent; and that, if he could defeat this, the rout of his\nenemy would be secured. The French advanced with great rapidity, and\nattacked the Sepoys in front and flank, so vigorously that they broke\nin disorder. The rajah's troops fled instantly; and, in spite of the\nexhortations of Forde, the Sepoys presently followed their example,\nand fled with the rajah's troops to Chambol, pursued by the enemy's\nhorse.\n\nThey would have suffered even more severely than they did, in this\npursuit, had not Charlie Marryat launched his little squadron at the\nenemy's horse. Keeping his men well together, he made repeated\ncharges, several times riding through and through them; until at last\nthey desisted from the pursuit and, forming in a compact body, fell\nback towards the field of battle; Charlie, who had already lost twelve\nmen, not thinking it prudent again to attack so strong a force.\n\nConflans' easy success over the Sepoys was fatal to him. Believing\nthat he had defeated the English, he gave orders to several companies\nof the French troops to press on in pursuit, without delay. They\nstarted off in hot speed, proceeding without much order or regularity,\nwhen they were suddenly confronted by the whole line of English\ntroops, in solid order, advancing from the high corn to take the place\nlately occupied by the Sepoys. In vain, the scattered and surprised\ncompanies of the French endeavoured to reform, and make head against\nthem. So heavy was the fire of musketry opened by the British line,\nimmediately they had taken up their position, that the French broke\ntheir ranks, and ran back as fast as they could to regain their guns,\nwhich were fully half a mile in the rear.\n\nIn the meantime, the French Sepoys on their left had been gradually\ndriving back the English right; but Forde, disregarding this, pressed\nforward in hot pursuit of the French with his English, behind whom the\ngreater portion of the beaten Sepoys had already rallied. Keeping his\nmen well together, he advanced at the fullest speed, following so\nclosely upon the enemy that the latter had only time to fire one or\ntwo rounds, with their thirteen guns, before the English were upon\nthem. The French, who had already lost heart by the serious check\nwhich had befallen them, were unable to stand the shock, and at once\nretreated, leaving their guns behind them.\n\nAs Forde had anticipated, the French Sepoys, seeing their centre and\nright defeated, desisted from their attack on the English right, and\nfell back upon their camp. The English Sepoys at once marched forward,\nand joined Forde's force. The rajah's troops, however, the whole of\nwhom had fled, remained cowering in the shelter of a large dry tank.\n\nForde did not wait for them; but, leaving his guns behind him, pressed\nforward, an hour after the defeat of the French, against their camp.\nTo reach this, he had to pass along a narrow valley, commanded by the\nFrench heavy guns. These opened fire, but the English pressed forward\nwithout wavering. The defenders, not yet recovered from the effects of\ntheir defeat in the plain, at once gave way, and retreated in the\nutmost confusion towards Rajahmahendri. Had the cavalry of Anandraz\nbeen at hand to follow up the advantage, great numbers might have been\ncaptured. As it was, Charlie Marryat, with his little force, harassed\nthem for some miles; but was unable to effect any serious damage on so\nstrong a body. The English captured thirty-two pieces of cannon, and\nall the stores, ammunition, and tents of the French.\n\nForde at once despatched a battalion of Sepoys, under Captain Knox, in\npursuit; and this officer pressed on so vigorously that he approached\nRajahmahendri the same evening. Two more native battalions reached\nKnox during the night.\n\nSo thoroughly dispirited were the enemy, that the sight of the\nred-coated Sepoys of Knox, whom they could not distinguish from\nEnglish, induced them to abandon Rajahmahendri in all haste, although\nit contained a strong mud fort, with several guns. The Godavery is two\nmiles wide, and all night the passage of the river in boats continued;\nand when, at daybreak next morning, Knox broke into the town, he found\nfifteen Europeans still on the banks, expecting a returning boat.\nThese he captured; and seeing, upon the opposite bank, a party about\nto disembark guns and stores from another boat, he opened fire from\nthe guns of the fort towards it; and, although the shot could scarcely\nreach halfway across the river, such was the terror of the enemy that\nthey forsook the boat, and fled. Knox at once sent a boat across, and\nbrought back that containing the guns.\n\nThe French retreated to Masulipatam, the capital of the province, a\nport which rivalled Madras in its commerce. Forde determined to follow\nthem there, but he was hindered by want of money to pay his troops.\nThis the Rajah Anandraz, who had promised to supply money, now,\nexcited and arrogant by the victory which he had done nothing towards\ngaining, refused to supply; and many weeks were spent in negotiations,\nbefore Forde was able to move forward.\n\nCharlie was no longer with him. The very day before the fight of\nCondore, letters had arrived from Madras, stating the urgency of the\nposition there; and, upon the night after the battle, Colonel Forde\nordered Charlie to return to aid in the defence of that city, before\nwhich the French had appeared on the 29th of November.\n\nSeveral skirmishes took place outside the city, and the English then\nretired within the fort. The force consisted of sixteen hundred white\ntroops, and two thousand three hundred Sepoys. The nabob, who had also\nretired into the town, had two hundred horse and a huge retinue of\nattendants.\n\nOn the morning of the 14th the French occupied the town, and the next\nday the English made a sortie, with six hundred men. These, for a\nwhile, drove the French before them through the streets of Madras; but\nas the French gradually rallied, the fire upon the English was so\nheavy that the sortie was repulsed, with a loss of two hundred\nsoldiers and six officers killed, wounded, and prisoners. The French\nloss had been about the same. Had not a large quantity of the French\ntroops broken into the wine stores on their arrival, and drunk to a\npoint of intoxication, it is probable that none of the British party\nwould have returned to the fort. The sortie had, however, the effect\nthat Saubinet, one of the best of the French officers, was killed, and\nCount D'Estaign, an able general, taken prisoner.\n\nFor some time, the siege proceeded slowly, the French waiting for the\narrival of their siege artillery, by ship, from Pondicherry. The fort\nof Madras was now a far more formidable post than it had been when the\nFrench before captured it. In the year 1743 Mr. Smith, an engineer,\nhad marked out the lines for a considerable increase in the\nfortifications. The ditch was dug and faced with brick, but on account\nof the expense, nothing further had been done. The French had added\nsomewhat to the fortifications during their stay there in 1750.\nNothing had been done by the English when they recovered the town,\nuntil the news of the preparations which the French were making for\nthe siege of the place had been received. Four thousand natives were\nthen set to work; and these, in eighteen months, had completed the\nfortifications, as designed by Mr. Smith, just before the arrival of\nthe French.\n\nThe latter determined to attack from the northern side. Here the fort\nwas protected by a demi-bastion, next to the sea; and by the Royal\nBastion, the wall between the two being covered by a work known as the\nNorth Ravelin. The defence was also strengthened by the fire of the\nnorthwest lunette, and Pigot's Bastion.\n\nAgainst these the French threw up four batteries. Lally's Battery,\nerected by the regiment of that name, was on the seashore directly\nfacing the demi-bastion. To its right was the Burying Ground Battery,\nfacing the Royal Bastion. Against the western face of this position\nthe French regiment of Lorraine erected a strong work, while farther\nround to the west, on a rising ground, they threw up a battery called\nthe Hospital Battery, which kept up a crossfire on the English\nposition.\n\nTo prevent the French from pressing forward along the strip of shore\nbetween the fort and the sea, the English erected a strong stockade,\nbehind which was a battery called the Fascine Battery.\n\nA few days after the siege began, it was found that the numbers\ncrowded up in the fort could scarcely be accommodated; and the rajah\nwas, therefore, invited to leave by sea, on board a ship which would\nland him at the Dutch settlement of Negapatam, whence he might journey\nthrough the Tanjore country to Trichinopoli. This proposal he\nwillingly accepted, and embarked with his wife, women, and children,\nhis other followers leaving by the land side, opposite to that\ninvested by the French. Thus the garrison were relieved of the\nembarrassment, and consumption of food, caused by four hundred men and\ntwo hundred horse.\n\nCharlie rode, with his troop, without interruption through the\ncountry, avoiding all bodies of the enemy until he reached the sea,\nfifteen miles north of Madras. Here he hired a native boat and,\nleaving the troops under the command of Ensign Anstey, sailed for\nMadras; in order to inform the garrison of Forde's victory over the\nFrench, and to concert, with the governor, as to the measures which he\nwished him to carry out to harass the enemy. He was accompanied only\nby Tim and Hossein.\n\nThe wind was fair and, starting an hour before sunset, the boat ran\ninto Madras roads two hours later. The Harlem, which had that day\narrived with artillery for the French from Pondicherry, fired at the\nlittle craft; and the native boatmen were about to turn the head of\nthe craft northward again. Charlie, however, drew his pistol, and\nHossein took his place with his drawn tulwar by the helmsman. The\nboatmen, thereupon, again continued their course; and, though several\nshots fell near them, they escaped untouched, and anchored just\noutside the surf, abreast of the fort.\n\nThe English had taken the precaution of erecting a number of huts\nunder the walls of the fort for the boatmen, in order to be able to\ncommunicate with any ship arriving, or to send messages in or out. As\nsoon as the boat anchored, a catamaran put out, and brought Charlie\nand his followers to shore. There was great joy at the receipt of his\nnews, and the guns of the fort fired twenty-one shots towards the\nenemy, in honor of the victory.\n\nGovernor Pigot was in general command of the defence, having under him\nColonel Lawrence, in command of the troops. The latter, after\ninquiring from Charlie the character of the officer he had left in\ncommand of his troop, and finding that he was able and energetic,\nrequested Charlie to send orders to him to join either the force under\nCaptain Preston, at Chingalpatt, or that of a native leader, Mahomed\nIssoof, both of whom were ravaging and destroying the country about\nConjeveram, whence the French besieging Madras drew most of their\nprovisions. Charlie himself was requested to remain in the fort, where\nhis experience in sieges would render him of great value.\n\nAt daybreak on the 2nd of January, the Lorraine and Lally Batteries\nopened fire. The English guns, however, proved superior in weight and\nnumber, dismounted two of the cannon, and silenced the others. The\nFrench mortars continued to throw heavy shell into the fort, and that\nnight most of the European women and children were sent away, in\nnative boats. The French batteries, finding the superiority of the\nEnglish fire, ceased firing until the 6th, when seven guns and six\nlarge mortars from Lally's Battery, and eight guns and two mortars\nfrom the Lorraine Battery, opened upon the town.\n\nThe cannonade now continued without intermission, but the enemy gained\nbut little advantage. Every day, however, added to their strength, as\nfresh vessels with artillery continued to arrive from Pondicherry.\nThey were now pushing their approaches from Lally's Battery towards\nthe demi-bastion. The losses on the part of the besieged were\nconsiderable, many being killed and wounded each day. This continued\nto the end of the month, in spite of many gallant sorties by parties\nof the besiegers, who repeatedly killed and drove out the working\nparties in the head of the French trenches. These progressed steadily,\nand reached to the outworks of the demi-bastion.\n\nOn the 25th the Shaftesbury, one of the Company's trading vessels,\ncommanded by Captain Inglis, was seen approaching. The five French\nships hoisted English colours. A catamaran was sent out to warn her,\nand at nine o'clock in the evening she came to anchor. She had on\nboard only some invalids, but brought the welcome news that three\nother ships, with troops, would soon be up. She had on board, too,\nthirty-seven chests of silver, and many military stores, among them\nhand grenades and large shell, which were most welcome to the\ngarrison, who had nearly expended their supply. The native boats went\noff from the fort, and brought on shore the ammunition and stores.\n\nIn the afternoon the Shaftesbury was attacked by the two French ships,\nthe Bristol and the Harlem. She fought them for two hours, and then\nsailed in and anchored again near the fort. The French ships lay off\nat a distance, and these and one of their batteries played upon the\nShaftesbury after she had anchored, and continued to do so for the\nnext three days.\n\nMany of the guns of the fort were dismounted by the artillery fire,\nwhich had continued, with scarcely any intermission, for a month. The\nparapets of the ramparts were in many places beaten down, and the\nwalls exposed to the enemy's fire greatly damaged. The enemy now\nopened their breaching battery close to the works, and on the 7th two\nbreaches had been effected, and Lally ordered his principal engineer\nand artillery officers to give their opinion as to the practicability\nof an assault.\n\nThese, however, considered that the assault would have no prospect of\nsuccess, as the guns commanding the ditch were still uninjured, and\nthe palisades which stormers must climb over before reaching the\nbreach untouched. So heavy a crossfire could be brought to bear by the\nbesieged upon an assaulting column, that it would be swept away before\nit could mount the breach. These officers added their opinion that,\nconsidering the number of men defending the fort in comparison with\nthose attacking it, final success could not be looked for, and further\nprosecution of the works would only entail a useless loss of life.\n\nOn the 9th of February, the French attacked Mahomed Issoof's men and\nthose of Captain Preston; the whole under the command of Major\nCalliaud, who had come up from Trichinopoli, and had taken station\nthree miles in rear of the French position. The greater part of the\nnatives, as usual, behaved badly; but Calliaud, with the artillery and\na few Sepoys, defended himself till nightfall; and then drew off.\n\nFor the next week the French continued to fire, and their approaches\nwere pushed on. Several sorties were made, but matters remained\nunchanged until the 14th, when six English ships were seen standing\ninto the roads; and that night the French drew out from their\ntrenches, and retreated. The next morning six hundred troops landed\nfrom the ships, and the garrison, who had so stoutly resisted the\nassaults made upon them for forty-two days, sallied out to inspect the\nenemy's works. Fifty-two cannon were left in them, and so great was\nthe hurry with which the French retreated that they left forty-four\nsick in the hospital behind.\n\nThe fort fired, during the siege, 26,554 rounds from their cannon,\n7502 shells, threw 1990 hand grenades, and expended 200,000 musketry\ncartridges. Thirty pieces of cannon and five mortars had been\ndismounted during the siege. Of the Europeans, the loss in killed,\nwounded, and prisoners was five hundred and seventy-nine. Three\nhundred and twenty-two Sepoys were killed and wounded, and four\nhundred and forty deserted during the siege.\n\nIn spite of the resolution with which the French had pushed the siege,\nit was, from the first, destined to failure. The garrison were well\nprovisioned, had great stores of ammunition, and plenty of spare\ncannon to replace those disabled or dismounted. The works were strong,\nand the garrison not greatly inferior in number to the besiegers. The\nFrench, on the other hand, had to bring their artillery, ammunition,\nand stores by water from Pondicherry; and the activity of the English\nparties in their rear rendered it extremely difficult for them to\nreceive supplies of food, by land. Lally had disgusted even the French\nofficers and soldiers by his arrogance, and passionate temper; while\nby the Sepoys he was absolutely hated.\n\nDuring the siege, Charlie had been most active in the defence. Colonel\nLawrence had assigned no special post to him, but used him as what\nwould now be called his chief of the staff. He was ever where the fire\nwas thickest, encouraging the men; and, during the intervals of\ncomparative cessation of fire, he went about the fort, seeing to the\ncomforts of the men in their quarters, to the issue of stores, and\nother matters.\n\nUpon the very morning after the French had withdrawn, he asked to be\nallowed to rejoin his troop, which was with Major Calliaud, and at\nonce started to rejoin Colonel Forde. He wished to take the whole of\nhis corps with him; but Colonel Lawrence considered that these would\nbe of extreme use in following up the French, and in subsequent\noperations, as cavalry was an arm in which the English were greatly\ndeficient.\n\nColonel Forde had been terribly delayed by the conduct of Rajah\nAnandraz, and the delay enabled the French again to recover heart. He\nwas not able to move forward until the 1st of March. On the 6th he\narrived before Masulipatam, and the following day Charlie joined him,\nwith his troop.\n\nThe fort of Masulipatam stood in an extremely defensible position. It\nwas surrounded by a swamp, on three sides. The other face rested on\nthe river. From the land side, it was only approachable by a causeway\nacross the swamp, and this was guarded by a strong ravelin, which is\nthe military name for an outwork erected beyond the ditch of a\nfortress. It was, in all respects, capable of a prolonged defence. In\nform it was an irregular parallelogram, about eight hundred yards in\nlength and six hundred yards wide, and on the walls were eleven strong\nbastions. The morass which surrounded it was of from three to eighteen\nfeet in depth.\n\nOn the approach of Forde, Conflans evacuated the town; which, also\nsurrounded by swamps, and lying two miles to the northwest of the\nfort, was itself a most defensible position; and retired across the\nnarrow causeway, more than a mile long, to the fort.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27. Masulipatam.\n\n\n\"I am heartily glad that you have come, Marryat,\" Colonel Forde said,\nas Charlie rode up. \"I have got here at last, as you see, but that is\na very different thing from getting in. An uglier place to attack I\nnever saw; and in other respects, matters are not bright.\n\n\"Anandraz is a constant worry and trouble to me. He has everything to\ngain by our success, and yet will do nothing to aid it. His men are\nworse than useless in fight, and the only thing which we want and he\ncould give us--money--he will not let us have.\n\n\"Will you ride with me, to the spot where I'm erecting my batteries,\nand you will see the prospect for yourself?\"\n\nThe prospect was, as Charlie found when he saw it, the reverse of\ncheerful. The point which Forde had selected to erect his batteries\nwas on some sandbanks, eight hundred yards from the eastern face of\nthe fort. It would be impossible to construct approaches against the\nwalls; and, should a breach be made, there still remained a wide creek\nto be crossed, beyond which lay the deep, and in most parts absolutely\nimpassable, swamp.\n\nCharlie and his men were employed in bringing in provisions from the\nsurrounding country; but a short distance in the rear, a French column\nunder Du Rocher, with two hundred European and two thousand native\ntroops, with four field pieces, watched the British, and rendered the\ncollection of provisions difficult. Du Rocher had several strong\nplaces, with European and Sepoy garrisons, near him, in which to\nretire in case Forde should advance against him.\n\n\"Well, Mister Charles,\" Tim said, one morning, \"this is altogether a\nquare sort of a siege. Here we are, with a place in front of us with\nten times as many guns as we have got, and a force well nigh twice as\nlarge. Even if there were no walls, and no guns, I don't see how we\ncould get at 'em, barring we'd wings, for this bog is worse than\nanything in the ould country. Then behind us we've got another army,\nwhich is, they say, with the garrisons of the forts, as strong as we\nare. We've got little food and less money, and the troops are\ngrumbling mightily, I can tell you.\"\n\nOn the 18th of March, while his batteries were still incomplete, Forde\nreceived certain news that the Nizam of the Deccan, the old ally of\nthe French, was advancing with an army of forty thousand men to attack\nhim. No British commander ever stood in a position of more imminent\nperil.\n\nThis completed the terror of Anandraz. Du Rocher had caused reports to\nbe circulated that he intended to march against that chief's\nterritories, and the news of the approach of the nizam, who was his\nsuzerain lord, completed his dismay. He refused to advance another\npenny. Colonel Forde had already expended the prize money gained by\nthe troops, his own private funds, and those of his officers, in\nbuying food for his troops; and the men were several months in arrear\nof their pay.\n\n\"I'm afraid, yer honor,\" Tim said that evening to Charlie, \"that\nthere's going to be a shindy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a shindy, Tim?\"\n\n\"I mane, yer honor, that the men are cursing and swearing, and saying\nthe divil a bit will they fight any longer. It's rank mutiny and\nrebellion, yer honor; but there's something to be said for the poor\nboys. They have seen all the prize money they have taken spent. Not a\nthraneen have they touched for months. Their clothes are in rags, and\nhere they are before a place which there's no more chance of their\ntaking than there is of their flying up to the clouds. And now they\nhear that, besides the French behind us, there's the nizam with forty\nthousand of his men marching against us. It's a purty kettle of fish\naltogether, yer honor.\n\n\"It isn't for myself I care, Mr. Charles. Haven't I got an order in my\npocket, on the treasury at Madras, for three hundred pound and over;\nbut it's mighty hard, yer honor, just when one has become a wealthy\nman, to be shut up in a French prison.\"\n\n\"Well, Tim, I hope there will be no trouble; but I own that things\nlook bad.\"\n\n\"Hossein has been saying, yer honor, that he thinks that the best way\nwould be for him and me to go out and chop off the heads of half a\ndozen of the chief ringleaders. But I thought I'd better be after\nasking yer honor's pleasure in the affair, before I set about it.\"\n\nTo Tim's great disappointment, Charlie told him that the step was one\nto which he could hardly assent, at present.\n\nThe next morning, the troops turned out with their arms, and\nthreatened to march away. Forde spoke to them gently, but firmly. He\ntold them that he could not believe that men who had behaved so\ngallantly, at Condore, would fail now in their duty. He begged them to\nreturn to their tents, and to send two of their number, as deputies,\nto him.\n\nThis they did. The deputies came to the colonel's tent, and told him\nthat all were resolved to fight no more; unless they were immediately\npaid the amount of prize money due to them, and were assured of the\nwhole booty, in case Masulipatam should be taken. Colonel Forde\npromised that they would receive their prize money out of the very\nfirst funds which reached him. As to the booty which might be taken in\nMasulipatam, he said he had no power to change the regulations of the\nCompany, but that he would beg them, under consideration of the\nhardships which the troops had endured, and their great services, to\nforego their half of the plunder. Directly Masulipatam was taken, he\nsaid, he would divide one half among them, and hold the other until he\nobtained the Company's answer to his request. Then he would distribute\nit, at once. With this answer the troops were satisfied, and returned\nat once to their duty.\n\nOn the 25th, the guns of the battery opened fire upon the fort, but\nthe damage which they did was inconsiderable. On the 27th, news came\nthat the French army of observation had retaken Rajahmahendri; and\nthat the nizam, with his army, had arrived at Baizwara, forty miles\ndistant. Letters came in, from the nizam to Anandraz, ordering him\ninstantly to quit the English camp, and join him. The rajah was so\nterrified that, that night, he started with his troops without giving\nany information of his intentions to Colonel Forde; and dilatory as\nwere his motions in general, he, on this occasion, marched sixteen\nmiles before daybreak.\n\nThe instant Colonel Forde heard that he had left, he sent for Charlie\nMarryat.\n\n\"I suppose you have heard, Marryat, that that scoundrel Anandraz has\nbolted. Ride off to him with your troop, and do your best to persuade\nhim to return.\"\n\n\"I will do so, sir,\" Charlie said; \"but really, it seems to me that we\nare better without him than with him. His men only consume our\nprovisions, and cause trouble, and they are no more good fighting than\nso many sheep.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" Colonel Forde said. \"But in the first place, his five\nthousand men, absolutely worthless as they are, swell our forces to a\nrespectable size. If Conflans and Du Rocher saw how small is our\nreally fighting body, they would fall upon us together, and annihilate\nus. In the second place, if Anandraz goes to the nizam he will at\nonce, of course, declare for the French, and will give up Vizapatam\nand the rest of the ground we won by the battle of Condore. The whole\nof the fruits of the campaign would be lost, and we should only hold\nthat portion of the Northern Sirkars on which our troops here are\nencamped.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Colonel,\" Charlie said. \"You are right, and I am\nwrong. I will start at once.\"\n\nPutting himself at the head of his five-and-twenty men, Charlie rode\noff at once in pursuit of the rajah. He found him encamped in a\nvillage. Charlie had already instructed his men as to the course which\nthey were to pursue, and halted them at a distance of fifty yards from\nthe rajah's tent. Then dismounting, and followed by Tim as his\norderly, and Hossein as his body servant, he walked to the tent.\n\nHe found Anandraz surrounded by his chief officers. The rajah received\nhim coldly; but Charlie, paying no attention to this, took a seat\nclose to him.\n\n\"I am come, Rajah,\" he said, \"from Colonel Forde, to point out to you\nthe folly of the course which you have pursued. By the line which you\nhave taken so far, it is evidently your intention to cross the\nGodavery, and retire to your own country. What chance have you of\naccomplishing this? By this time, the cavalry of the nizam will be\nscattered over the whole country between this and the Godavery. At\nRajahmahendri is Du Rocher, with his army, who will take you in flank.\nEven supposing that you reach your own country, what is the future\nopen to you? If the English are finally successful, they will deprive\nyou of your rank and possessions for deserting them now. If the French\nare victorious, they and the nizam will then turn their attention to\nyou; and you cannot hope to escape with life, when your treason has\nbrought such troubles upon them.\"\n\nThe rajah looked for a minute doubtful; and then, encouraged by the\nmurmurs of the officers around him, who were weary of the expedition\nand its labours, although their troops had not fired a single shot, he\nsaid obstinately:\n\n\"No more words are needed. I have made up my mind.\"\n\n\"And so have I,\" Charlie said, and with a sudden spring he leaped upon\nthe rajah, seized him by the throat, and placed a pistol to his ear.\n\nHossein drew his sword, and rushed to his side. Tim ran outside and\nheld up his arm, and the little body of cavalry at once rode up; and,\nhalf of them dismounting, entered the tent with drawn swords.\n\nSo astounded were the officers of the rajah, at Charlie's sudden\nattack, that for a moment they knew not what to do; and before they\ncould recover from their surprise, Charlie's troopers entered.\n\n\"Take this man,\" Charlie said, pointing to the rajah, \"to that tree,\nand hang him at once. Cut down any of these fellows who move a\nfinger.\"\n\nThe rajah was dragged to the tree, almost lifeless with terror.\n\n\"Now, Rajah,\" Charlie said, \"you either give instant orders for your\narmy to march back to Masulipatam, or up you go on that branch above\nthere.\"\n\nThe terrified rajah instantly promised to carry out Charlie's orders,\nand to remain faithful to the English. The officers were brought out\nfrom the tent, and received orders from the rajah to set his troops\ninstantly in motion on their way back. The rajah was led to his tent,\nand there kept under a guard, until the army was in motion. When the\nwhole of it was well on its way, Charlie said:\n\n\"Now, Rajah, we will ride on. We will say no more about this little\naffair, and I will ask Colonel Forde to forgive your ill behaviour in\nleaving him. But mind, if at any future time you attempt to disobey\nhis orders, or to retire from the camp, I will blow out your brains;\neven if I have to follow you, with my men, into the heart of your own\npalace.\"\n\nUpon their return to the British camp, Charlie explained to Colonel\nForde the measures which he was obliged to take, to convince the rajah\nof the soundness of his arguments; and of these Colonel Forde entirely\napproved. He told Charlie that he had sent off, to open negotiations\nwith Salabut Jung, so as to detain him as long as possible at\nBaizwara.\n\nWithout any intermission, the batteries continued to play on the fort\nfrom the 25th of March to the 6th of April. Several houses had been\ndestroyed, and some breaches effected; but these the French repaired\nin the night, as fast as they were made. They were aware of the\nposition of the English, and regarded the siege with contempt.\n\nOn the morning of the 7th, news came that the nizam was advancing from\nBaizwara to attack the English; and that Du Rocher was hurrying from\nRajahmahendri, to effect a junction with him. The same morning, the\nsenior artillery officer reported to Colonel Forde that only two days'\nammunition for the batteries remained in store. He learned, too, that\na ship with three hundred French soldiers would arrive, in the course\nof a day or two.\n\nThe position was, indeed, a desperate one, and there remained only the\nalternatives of success against the fort, or total destruction. He\ndetermined to attack. All day, his batteries kept up a heavier fire\nthan ever, maintaining an equal fire against all the bastions in order\nthat, if the enemy should obtain any information of the projected\nattack, they would not know against which point it was directed.\nColonel Forde had ascertained that fishermen were in the habit of\nmaking their way, across the swamp, to the southwest angle of the\nfort, that on the sea face opposite to the British frontiers. He\ndetermined to effect a diversion, by an attack upon that side; and\ntherefore ordered Captain Knox, with seven hundred Sepoys, to make a\ndetour to cross the swamp, and to attack upon that side. Still further\nto distract the attention of the garrison, he instructed Anandraz to\nadvance with his men along the causeway, and to open fire against the\nravelin. The main attack, which consisted of the rest of the force,\ncomposed of three hundred and twenty European infantry, thirty\ngunners, thirty sailors, and seven hundred Sepoys, was to be delivered\nagainst the breach in the bastion, mounting ten guns, in the northeast\nangle of the fort.\n\nAt ten o'clock, the force drew up under arms. The fire of the\nbatteries was kept up, much later than usual, in order that the enemy\nshould have no time to repair the breaches. The hour of midnight was\nfixed for the attack, as at that time the tide was at its lowest, and\nthe water in the ditches round the ramparts not more than three feet\ndeep.\n\nCaptain Knox and his party started first. The main body should have\nset out half an hour later, but were detained, owing to the\nunaccountable absence of Captain Callender, the officer who was to\ncommand it. As this officer was afterwards killed, the cause of his\nabsence was never explained. The party started without him, and before\nthey could reach the ditch, they heard the sound of firing from the\nfarther corner of the fort, telling that Knox was already at work.\n\n\"Shure, yer honor,\" muttered Tim, as he made his way through the\nswamp, knee deep, beside his master, \"this is worse than the day\nbefore Plassey. It was water then, but this thick mud houlds one's\nlegs fast at every step. I've lost one of my boots, already.\"\n\nIt was indeed hard work; but at last, the head of the column reached\nthe ditch, just as a fresh burst of firing told that the Rajah\nAnandraz was attacking the ravelin. The French, in their belief in the\nabsolute security of the place, had taken but few precautions against\nan attack; and it was not until the leading party had waded, nearly\nbreast high, through the ditch; and began to break down the palisade\nbeyond it, that they were discovered. Then a heavy artillery and\nmusketry fire from the bastions on the right and left was opened upon\nthe assailants.\n\nCaptain Fisher with the first division attacked the breach; Captain\nMaclean with the second covered them, by opening fire upon the bastion\non their right; while the third, led by Captain Yorke, replied to that\non their left. Charlie, although superior in rank to any of these\nofficers, had no specific command, but accompanied the party as a\nsimple volunteer.\n\nThe storming party soon mounted the breach, and Yorke's division\njoined it on the top. Yorke, turning to the left, seized the bastion\nwhich was firing on Maclean; while Fisher turned along the ramparts to\nthe right, to secure the bastions in that direction.\n\nJust as Yorke was setting out he saw a strong body of French Sepoys,\nadvancing between the foot of the ramparts and the buildings of the\ntown. These had been sent, directly the firing was heard, to reinforce\nthe bastion just carried. Without a moment's hesitation, Yorke ran\ndown the rampart, seized the French officer who commanded, and ordered\nhim to surrender at once, as the place was already taken. Confused and\nbewildered, the officer gave up his sword, and ordered the Sepoys to\nlay down their arms. They were then sent, as prisoners, into the\nbastion.\n\nYorke now pushed forward, with his men, at the foot of the rampart;\nand carried two out of three of the bastions on that side. The men,\nhowever, separated from the rest, and alone in the unknown town, were\nbeginning to lose heart. Suddenly they came upon a small magazine, and\nsome of the men called out, \"A mine!\" Seized with a sudden panic, the\nwhole division ran back, leaving Yorke alone with two native drummer\nboys, who continued to beat the advance. The soldiers, however, did\nnot stop running until they reached the bastion.\n\nCaptain Yorke went back, and found that many of the soldiers were\nproposing to leave the fort, altogether. He swore that he would cut\ndown the first man who moved, and some of the men who had served with\nhim in the 39th, ashamed of their conduct, said that they would follow\nhim. Heading the thirty-six men who had now come to their senses,\nCaptain Yorke again advanced, with the drummer boys.\n\nJust as he was setting out, Charlie, who had at first gone with\nFisher's division, hearing an entire cessation of fire on the other\nside, ran up to see what was going on.\n\n\"Major Marryat,\" Captain Yorke said, \"will you rally these fellows,\nand bring them after me. They've been frightened with a false alarm of\na mine, and have lost their heads altogether.\"\n\nCharlie, aided by Tim, exerted himself to the utmost to encourage and\ncommand the soldiers, shaming them by telling them that while they,\nEuropean soldiers, were cowering in the bastion, their Sepoy comrades\nwere winning the town.\n\n\"Unless,\" he said, \"in one minute the whole of you are formed up ready\nto advance, I will take care that not one shall have a share in the\nprize money that will be won tonight.\"\n\nThe men now fell in, and Charlie led them after Captain Yorke. The\nfirst retreat of the latter's division had given the French time to\nrally a little, and as he now made along the rampart towards the\nbastion on the river, the French officer in command there, having\nturned a gun and loaded it with grape, discharged it when the English\nwere within a few yards. Captain Yorke fell, badly wounded. The two\nblack drummer boys were killed, as were several of the men, and\nsixteen others were wounded.\n\nCharlie, hurrying along with the rest of the party, met the survivors\nof Captain Yorke's little band coming back, carrying their wounded\nofficer.\n\n\"There,\" Charlie shouted to his men, \"that is your doing. Now retrieve\nyourselves. Show you are worthy of the name of British soldiers.\"\n\nWith a shout, the men rushed forward and carried the bastion, and this\ncompleted the capture of the whole of the wall, from the northeast\nangle to the river.\n\nIn the meantime Captain Fisher, with his division, was advancing to\nthe right along the rampart. Maclean's men had joined him, and they\nwere pushing steadily forward. Colonel Forde continued with the\nreserve at the bastion first taken, receiving reports from both\ndivisions as they advanced, and sending the necessary orders. As fast\nas the prisoners were brought in, they were sent down the breach into\nthe ditch, where they were guarded by Sepoys, who threatened to shoot\nany that tried to climb up.\n\nMeanwhile, all was disorder in the town. Greatly superior as were the\nbesieged to their assailants in number, they could, if properly\nhandled, have easily driven them back. Instead, however, of\ndisregarding the attack by Knox at the southwest angle, which was\nclearly only a feint; and that of Anandraz on the ravelin, which might\nhave been disregarded with equal safety; and concentrating all their\nforces against the main attack, they made no sustained effort against\neither of the columns, which were rapidly carrying bastion after\nbastion. Conflans appeared to have completely lost his head, as\nmessenger after messenger arrived at his house, by the river, with\nnews of the progress of the English columns.\n\nAs Fisher's division advanced towards the bastion in which was the\ngreat gate, the French who had gathered there again attempted to check\nhis progress. But his men reserved their fire, until close to the\nenemy; and then, discharging a volley at a few yards' distance, they\nrapidly cleared the bastion. Fisher at once closed the great gates,\nand thus cut off all the defenders of the ravelin, and prevented any\nof the troops within from joining these, and cutting their way through\nthe rajah's troops, which would have been no difficult matter.\n\nJust as the division were again advancing, Captain Callender, to the\nastonishment of everyone, appeared and took his place at its head. A\nfew shots only were fired after this, and the last discharge killed\nCaptain Callender.\n\nBy this time Conflans, bewildered and terrified, had sent a message to\nColonel Forde, offering to surrender on honorable terms. Colonel Forde\nsent back to say that he would give no terms whatever; that the town\nwas in his power and further resistance hopeless; and that, if it\ncontinued longer, he would put all who did not surrender to the sword.\nOn the receipt of this message, Conflans immediately sent round orders\nthat all his men were to lay down their arms, and to fall in, in the\nopen space by the water.\n\nThe English assembled, on the parade, by the bastion of the gateway.\nCaptain Knox's column was marched round, from the southwest, into the\ntown. A strong body of artillery kept guard over the prisoners till\nmorning. Then the gate was opened, and the French in the ravelin\nentered the fort, and became prisoners with the rest of the garrison.\nThe whole number of prisoners exceeded three thousand, of whom five\nhundred were Europeans and the rest Sepoys. The loss of the English\nwas twenty-two Europeans killed, and sixty-two wounded. The Sepoys had\nfifty killed and a hundred and fifty wounded. The rajah's people, who\nhad kept up their false attack upon the ravelin with much more bravery\nand resolution than had been expected, also lost a good many men.\n\nConsidering the natural strength of the position, that the garrison\nwas, both in European troops and Sepoys, considerably stronger than\nthe besiegers, that the fort mounted a hundred and twenty guns, and\nthat a relieving army, enormously superior to that of the besiegers,\nwas within fifteen miles at the time the assault was made, the capture\nof Masulipatam may claim to rank among the very highest deeds ever\nperformed by British arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28. The Defeat Of Lally.\n\n\nA large quantity of plunder was obtained at Masulipatam. Half was at\nonce divided among the troops, according to promise, and the other\nhalf retained until the permission, applied for by Colonel Forde, was\nreceived from Madras for its division among them.\n\nThe morning after the capture of the town, the Mahratta horse of\nSalabut Jung appeared. The nizam was furious when he found that he had\narrived too late; but he resolved that when the three hundred French\ntroops, daily expected by sea, arrived, he would besiege Forde in his\nturn; as, with the new arrivals, Du Rocher's force would alone be\nsuperior to that of Forde, and there would be, in addition, his own\narmy of forty thousand men.\n\nThe ships arrived off the port three days later, and sent a messenger\non shore to Conflans. Finding that no answer was returned, and that\nthe fire had entirely ceased, they came to the conclusion that the\nplace was captured by the English, and sailed away to Pondicherry\nagain. Had Du Rocher taken the precaution of having boats in readiness\nto communicate with them, inform them of the real state of affairs,\nand order them to land farther along the coast and join him, Forde\nwould have been besieged in his turn, although certainly the siege\nwould have been ineffectual.\n\nRajah Anandraz, greatly terrified at the approach of the nizam, had,\ntwo days after the capture of the place, received a portion of the\nplunder as his share, and marched away to his own country; Forde,\ndisgusted with his conduct throughout the campaign, making no effort\nwhatever to retain him.\n\nWhen Salabut Jung heard that the French had sailed away to\nPondicherry, he felt that his prospects of retaking the town were\nsmall; and, at the same time receiving news that his own dominions\nwere threatened by an enemy, he concluded a treaty with Forde,\ngranting Masulipatam and the Northern Sirkars to the English, and\nagreeing never again to allow any French troops to enter his\ndominions. He then marched back to his own country.\n\nColonel Forde sailed with a portion of the force to Calcutta, where he\nshortly afterwards commanded at the battle of Chinsurah, where the\nDutch, who had made vast preparations to dispute the supremacy of the\nEnglish, were completely defeated; and thenceforth they, as well as\nthe French, sunk to the rank of small trading colonies under British\nprotection, in Bengal.\n\nCharlie returned to Madras, and journeying up the country he joined\nthe main body of his troop, under Peters. They had been engaged in\nseveral dashing expeditions, and had rendered great service; but they\nhad been reduced in numbers, by action and sickness; and the whole\nforce, when reunited, only numbered eighty sabres--Lieutenant Hallowes\nbeing killed. Peters had been twice wounded. The two friends were\ngreatly pleased to meet again, and had much to tell each other of\ntheir adventures, since they parted.\n\nThe next morning, a deputation of four of the men waited upon Charlie.\nThey said that, from their share of the booty of the various places\nthey had taken, all were now possessed of sums sufficient, in India,\nto enable them to live in comfort for the rest of their lives. They\nhoped, therefore, that Charlie would ask the authorities at Madras to\ndisband the corps, and allow them to return home. Their commander,\nhowever, pointed out to them that the position was still a critical\none; that the French possessed a very powerful army at Pondicherry,\nwhich would shortly take the field; and that the English would need\nevery one of their soldiers, to meet the storm. If victorious, there\ncould be no doubt that a final blow would be dealt to French\ninfluence, and that the Company would then be able to reduce its\nforces. A few months would settle the event, and it would, he knew, be\nuseless to apply for their discharge before that time. He thought he\ncould promise them, however, that by the end of the year, at latest,\ntheir services would be dispensed with.\n\nThe men, although rather disappointed, retired, content to make the\nbest of the circumstances. Desertions were very frequent in the Sepoy\nforce of the Company, as the men, returning to their native villages\nand resuming their former dress and occupation, were in no danger\nwhatever of discovery. But in Charlie's force not a single desertion\nhad taken place since it was raised; as the men knew that, by leaving\nthe colours, they would forfeit their share of the prize money, held\nfor them in the Madras treasury.\n\n\"Have you heard from home lately?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Charlie said. \"There was a large batch of letters lying for me,\nat Madras. My eldest sister, who has now been married three years, has\njust presented me with a second nephew. Katie and my mother are well.\"\n\n\"Your sister is not engaged yet?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"No. Katie says she's quite heart whole at present. Let me see--how\nold is she now? It is just eight years and a half since we left\nEngland, and she was twelve years old then. She is now past twenty.\n\n\"She would do nicely for you, Peters, when you go back. It would be\nawfully jolly, if you two were to fall in love with each other.\"\n\n\"I feel quite disposed to do so,\" Peters said, laughing, \"from your\ndescriptions of her. I've heard so much of her, in all the time we've\nbeen together; and she writes such bright merry letters, that I seem\nto know her quite well.\"\n\nFor Charlie, during the long evenings by the campfires, had often read\nto his friend the lively letters which he received from his sisters.\nPeters had no sisters of his own; and he had more than once sent home\npresents, from the many articles of jewelry which fell to his share of\nthe loot of captured fortresses, to his friend's sisters, saying to\nCharlie that he had no one in England to send things to, and that it\nkept up his tie with the old country; for he had been left an orphan,\nas a child.\n\nThe day after the deputation from his men had spoken to Charlie, Tim\nsaid:\n\n\"I hope, yer honor, that whin the troop's disbanded, you will be going\nhome for a bit, yourself.\"\n\n\"I intend to do so, Tim. I have been wanting to get away, for the last\ntwo years, but I did not like to ask for leave until everything was\nsettled here. And what is more, when I once get back, I don't think\nthey will ever see me in India again. I have sufficient means to live\nas a wealthy man in England, and I've seen enough fighting to last a\nlifetime.\"\n\n\"Hooroo!\" shouted Tim. \"That's the best word I've heard for a long\ntime. And I shall settle down as yer honor's butler, and look after\nthe grand house, and see that you're comfortable.\"\n\n\"You must never leave me, Tim, that's certain,\" Charlie said. \"At\nleast, till you marry and set up an establishment of your own.\"\n\n\"If I can't marry without leaving yer honor, divil a wife will Tim\nKelly ever take.\"\n\n\"Wait till you see the right woman, Tim. There is no saying what the\nstrongest of us will do, when he's once caught in a woman's net.\nHowever, we'll talk of that when the time comes.\"\n\n\"And there's Hossein, yer honor. Fire and water wouldn't keep him away\nfrom you, though what he'll do in the colds of the winter at home is\nmore than I know. It makes me laugh to see how his teeth chatter, and\nhow the creetur shivers of a cold morning, here. But, cold or no cold,\nhe'd follow you to the north pole, and climb up it if yer honor told\nhim.\"\n\nCharlie laughed.\n\n\"He is safe not to be put to the test there, Tim. However, you may be\nsure that if Hossein is willing to go to England with me, he shall go.\nHe has saved my life more than once; and you and he shall never part\nfrom me, so long as you are disposed to stay by my side.\"\n\nFor some months, no great undertaking was attempted on either side.\nMany petty sieges and skirmishes took place, each party preparing for\nthe great struggle, which was to decide the fate of Southern India.\n\nAt last, in January, 1760, the rival armies approached each other.\nCaptain Sherlock, with thirty Europeans and three hundred Sepoys, were\nbesieged by the French in the fort of Vandivash, which had shortly\nbefore been captured by them from the French.\n\nLally was himself commanding the siege, having as his second in\ncommand Monsieur Bussy, of whom, however, he was more jealous than\never. Lally's own incapacity was so marked that the whole army, and\neven Lally's own regiment, recognized the superior talents of Bussy.\nBut although Lally constantly asked the advice of his subordinate, his\njealousy of that officer generally impelled him to neglect it.\n\nWhen the English, under Colonel Coote, who now commanded their forces\nin Madras, were known to be advancing against him, Bussy strongly\nadvised that the siege should be abandoned, and a strong position\ntaken up for the battle. The advice was unquestionably good, but Lally\nneglected it, and remained in front of Vandivash until the English\nwere seen approaching. The French cavalry, among whom were three\nhundred European dragoons, and a cloud of Mahratta horse moved forward\nagainst the English, whose troops were scattered on the line of march.\n\nColonel Coote brought up two guns, and these, being kept concealed\nfrom the enemy until they came within two hundred yards, opened\nsuddenly upon them, while the Sepoys fired heavily with their muskets.\nThe Mahrattas rapidly turned and rode off, and the French cavalry,\nfinding themselves alone, retired in good order.\n\nColonel Coote now drew up his army in order of battle, and marched his\ntroops so as to take up a position in front of some gardens, and other\ninclosures, which extended for some distance from the foot of the\nmountains out on to the plain. These inclosures would serve as a\ndefence, in case the army should be forced to retire from the open.\n\nThe French remained immovable in their camp. Seeing this, Colonel\nCoote marched his troops to the right, the infantry taking up their\npost in the stony ground at the foot of the mountain, at a mile and a\nhalf from the French camp. Some of the French cavalry came out to\nreconnoitre; but, being fired upon, returned.\n\nFinding that the French would not come out to attack, Colonel Coote\nagain advanced until he reached a point where, swinging round his\nright, he faced the enemy in a position of great strength. His right\nwas now covered by the fire of the fort, his left by the broken ground\nat the foot of the hills.\n\nAs soon as the English had taken up their position, the French sallied\nout from their camp and formed in line of battle. The French cavalry\nwere on their right; next to these was the regiment of Lorraine, four\nhundred strong; in the centre the battalion of India, seven hundred\nstrong. Next to these was Lally's regiment, four hundred strong, its\nleft resting upon an intrenched tank, which was held by three hundred\nmarines and sailors from their fleet, with four guns. Twelve other\nguns were in line, three between each regiment. Four hundred Sepoys\nwere in reserve, at a tank in rear of that held by the marines. Nine\nhundred Sepoys held a ridge behind the position, but in front of the\ncamp, and at each end of this ridge was an intrenchment, guarded by\nfifty Europeans. A hundred and fifty Europeans and three hundred\nSepoys remained in the batteries, facing Vandivash. The whole force\nconsisted of two thousand four hundred Europeans, and sixteen hundred\nSepoys. The Mahrattas, three thousand strong, remained in their own\ncamp, and did not advance to the assistance of their allies.\n\nThe English army consisted of nineteen hundred Europeans, of whom\neighty were cavalry, two thousand one hundred Sepoys, twelve hundred\nand fifty irregular horse, and twenty-six field guns. The Sepoys were\non the flanks, the Company's two battalions in the centre, with\nCoote's regiment on their right and Draper's on their left. The four\ngrenadier companies of the white regiments were withdrawn from the\nfighting line; and, with two hundred Sepoys on each flank, were held\nas a reserve. Ten field pieces were in line with the troops; two, with\ntwo companies of Sepoys, were posted a little on the left; the rest\nwere in reserve. The English line was placed somewhat obliquely across\nthat of the French, their left being the nearest to the enemy.\n\nAs the English took up their position, Lally led out his cavalry, made\na wide sweep round the plain, and then advanced against the English\nhorse, who were drawn up some little distance behind the reserve. Upon\nseeing their approach, the whole of the irregular horse fled at once,\nleaving only Charlie's troop remaining. The Sepoys with the two guns\non the left were ordered to turn these round, so as to take the\nadvancing French in flank; but the flight of their horse had shaken\nthe natives, and the French cavalry would have fallen, unchecked, on\nCharlie's little troop, which was already moving forward to meet them,\nhad not Captain Barlow, who commanded the British artillery, turned\ntwo of his guns and opened fire upon them.\n\nFifteen men and horses fell at the first discharge, throwing the rest\ninto some confusion; and at the next deadly discharge, the whole\nturned and rode off. Seeing the enemy retreating, many of the\nirregular horse rode back, and, joining Charlie's troop, pursued them\nround to the rear of their own camp.\n\nFor a short time a cannonade was kept up by the guns on both sides,\nthe English fire, being better directed, causing some damage. Upon\nLally's return to his camp with the cavalry, he at once gave the order\nto advance. Coote ordered the Europeans of his force to do the same,\nthe Sepoys to remain on their ground.\n\nThe musketry fire began at one o'clock. The English, according to\nCoote's orders, retained theirs until the enemy came close at hand.\nFollowing the tactics which were afterwards repeated many times in the\nPeninsula, the Lorraine regiment, forming a column twelve deep,\nadvanced against that of Coote, which received them in line. The\nFrench came on at the double. When within a distance of fifty yards,\nCoote's regiment poured a volley into the front and flanks of the\ncolumn. Although they suffered heavily from this fire, the French\nbravely pressed on with levelled bayonets, and the head of the column,\nby sheer weight, broke through the English line.\n\nThe flanks of the English, however, closed in on the sides of the\nFrench column, and a desperate hand-to-hand fight ensued. In this, the\nEnglish had all the advantage, attacking the French fiercely on either\nside, until the latter broke and ran back to the camp.\n\nColonel Coote, who was with his regiment, ordered it to form in\nregular order again, before it advanced, and rode off to see what was\ngoing on in the rest of the line. As he was passing on, a shot struck\nan ammunition waggon in the intrenched tank held by the French. This\nexploded, killing and wounding eighty men, among whom was the\ncommander of the post. The rest of its occupants, panic stricken by\nthe explosion, ran back to the next tank. Their panic communicated\nitself to the Sepoys there, and all ran back together to the camp.\n\nColonel Coote at once sent orders to Major Brereton, who commanded\nDraper's regiment, to take possession of the tank, before the enemy\nrecovered from the confusion which the explosion would be sure to\ncause. The ground opposite that which Draper's regiment occupied was\nheld by Lally's regiment, and in order to prevent his men being\nexposed to a flanking fire from these, Draper ordered them to file off\nto the right. Bussy, who commanded at this wing, endeavoured to rally\nthe fugitives, and gathering fifty or sixty together, added two\ncompanies of Lally's regiment to them, and posted them in the tank; he\nthen returned to the regiment.\n\nAs Major Brereton, moving up his men, reached the intrenchment, a\nheavy fire was poured upon him. Major Brereton fell, mortally wounded,\nand many of his men were killed. The rest, however, with a rush\ncarried the intrenchment, and firing down from the parapet on the guns\non Lally's left, drove the gunners from them. Two companies held the\nintrenchment, and the rest formed in the plain on its left, to prevent\nLally's regiment attacking it on this side.\n\nBussy wheeled Lally's regiment, detached a portion of it to recover\nthe intrenchment, and with the rest marched against Draper's troops in\nthe plain. A heavy musketry fire was kept up on both sides, until the\ntwo guns, posted by Draper's regiment, and left behind when they\nattacked the intrenchment, came up and opened on the French. These\nbegan to waver. Bussy, as the only chance of gaining the day, put\nhimself at their head, and endeavoured to lead them forward to attack\nthe English with the bayonet. His horse, however, was struck with a\nball and soon fell; the English fire was redoubled, and but twenty of\nLally's men kept round him.\n\nTwo companies of the English rushed forward and surrounded the little\nparty, who at once surrendered. Bussy was led a prisoner to the rear,\nand as he went was surprised at the sight of the three hundred\ngrenadiers, the best troops in the English army, remaining quietly in\nreserve.\n\nWhile on either flank the French were now beaten, the fight in the\ncentre, between the European troops of the English and French\nCompanies, had continued, but had been confined to a hot musketry and\nartillery fire. But upon seeing the defeat of their flanks, the\nenemy's centre likewise fell back to their camp.\n\nFrom the moment when the Lorraine regiment had been routed, four field\npieces kept up an incessant fire into their camp, to prevent them from\nrallying. The three English regiments now advanced in line, and\nentered the enemy's camp without the least opposition. The Lorraine\nregiment had passed through it, a mass of fugitives. The India\nregiment and Lally's went through rapidly, but in good order.\n\nLally had, in vain, endeavoured to bring the Sepoys forward to the\nattack, to restore the day. The French cavalry, seeing the defeat of\nLorraine's regiment, advanced to cover it, their appearance completely\nintimidating the English irregular horse. Charlie's troop were too\nweak to charge them single handed.\n\nReanimated by the attitude of their cavalry, the men of the Lorraine\nregiment rallied, yoked up four field pieces which were standing in\nthe rear of the camp, and moved off in fair order. They were joined in\nthe plain by Lally's regiment and the India battalion, and the whole,\nsetting fire to their tents, moved off in good order. The four field\npieces kept in the rear, and behind these moved the cavalry. As they\nretired, they were joined by the four hundred and fifty men from the\nbatteries opposite Vandivash.\n\nColonel Coote sent orders to his cavalry to harass the enemy. These\nfollowed them for five miles, but as the native horse would not\nventure within range of the enemy's field guns, Charlie, to his great\ndisappointment, was able to do nothing.\n\nUpon neither side did the Sepoys take any part in the battle of\nVandivash. It was fought entirely between the two thousand two hundred\nand fifty French, not including those in their battery, and sixteen\nhundred English, excluding the grenadiers, who never fired a shot.\nTwenty-four pieces of cannon were taken, and eleven waggons of\nammunition, and all the tents, stores, and baggage that were not\nburned. The French left two hundred dead upon the field. A hundred and\nsixty were taken prisoners, of whom thirty died of their wounds before\nthe next morning. Large numbers dropped upon the march, and were\nafterwards captured. The English had sixty-three killed, and a hundred\nand twenty-four wounded.\n\nThe news of this victory reached Madras on the following morning, and\nexcited as much enthusiastic joy as that of Plassey had done at\nCalcutta; and the event was almost as important a one. There was no\nlonger the slightest fear of danger, and the Madras authorities began\nto meditate an attack upon Pondicherry. So long as the great French\nsettlement remained intact, so long would Madras be exposed to fresh\ninvasions; and it was certain that France, driven now from Bengal,\nwould make a desperate effort to regain her shaken supremacy in\nMadras.\n\nThe force, however, at the disposal of the Madras authorities, was\nstill far too weak to enable them to undertake an enterprise like the\nsiege of Pondicherry; for their army did not exceed, in numbers, that\nwhich Lally possessed for its defence. Accordingly, urgent letters\nwere sent to Clive to ask him to send down, in the summer, as many\ntroops as he could spare, other reinforcements being expected from\nEngland at that time. The intervening time was spent in the reduction\nof Chittapett, Karical, and many other forts which held out for the\nFrench.\n\nAfter the battle of Vandivash, Charlie kept his promise to his men. He\nrepresented to Mr. Pigot that they had already served some months over\nthe time for which they were enlisted, that they had gone through\ngreat hardships, and performed great services, and that they were now\nanxious to retire to enjoy the prize money they had earned. He added\nthat he had given his own promise that they should be allowed to\nretire, if they would extend their service until after a decisive\nbattle with the French. Mr. Pigot at once assented to Charlie's\nrequest, and ordered that a batta of six months' pay should be given\nto each man, upon leaving.\n\nThe troop, joined by many of their comrades, who had been at different\ntimes sent down sick and wounded to Madras, formed up there on parade\nfor the last time. They responded with three hearty cheers to the\naddress which Charlie gave them, thanking them for their services,\nbidding them farewell, and hoping that they would long enjoy the prize\nmoney which they had gallantly won. Then they delivered over their\nhorses to the authorities, drew their prize money from the treasury,\nand started for their respective homes, the English portion taking up\ntheir quarters in barracks, until the next ship should sail for\nEngland.\n\n\"I am sorry to leave them,\" Charlie said to Peters, as they stood\nalone upon the parade. \"We have gone through a lot of stirring work\ntogether, and no fellows could have behaved better.\"\n\n\"No,\" Peters agreed. \"It is singular that, contemptible as are these\nnatives of India when officered by men of their own race and religion,\nthey will fight to the death when led by us.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29. The Siege Of Pondicherry.\n\n\nAs the health of the two officers was shaken by their long and arduous\nwork, and their services were not, for the moment, needed, they\nobtained leave for three months, and went down in a coasting ship to\nColumbo, where several English trading stations had been established.\nHere they spent two months, residing for the most part among the\nhills, at the town of a rajah very friendly to the English; and with\nhim they saw an elephant hunt, the herd being driven into a great\ninclosure, formed by a large number of natives who had, for weeks,\nbeen employed upon it. Here the animals were fastened to trees by\nnatives, who cut through the thick grass unobserved; and were one by\none reduced to submission, first by hunger, and then by being lustily\nbelaboured by the trunks of tamed elephants. Tim highly appreciated\nthe hunt, and declared that tiger shooting was not to be compared to\nit.\n\nTheir residence in the brisk air of the hills completely restored\ntheir health, and they returned to Madras perfectly ready to take part\nin the great operations which were impending. Charlie, on his return,\nwas appointed to serve as chief of the staff to Colonel Coote; Captain\nPeters being given the command of a small body of European horse, who\nwere, with a large body of irregulars, to aid in bringing in supplies\nto the British army, and to prevent the enemy from receiving food from\nthe surrounding country.\n\nEarly in June, the British squadron off the coast was joined by two\nships of the line, the Norfolk and Panther, from England; and a\nhundred Europeans, and a detachment of European and native artillery\ncame down from Bombay.\n\nAround Pondicherry ran a strong cactus hedge, strengthened with\npalisades, and the French retired into this at the beginning of July.\nThey were too strongly posted there to be attacked by the force with\nwhich the English at first approached them, and they were expecting\nthe arrival of a large body of troops from Mysore, with a great convoy\nof provisions.\n\nOn the 17th these approached. Major Moore, who was guarding the\nEnglish rear, had a hundred and eighty European infantry; fifty\nEnglish horse, under Peters; sixteen hundred irregular horse; and\neleven hundred Sepoys. The Mysoreans had four thousand good horse, a\nthousand Sepoys, and two hundred Europeans, with eight pieces of\ncannon.\n\nThe fight lasted but a few minutes. The British native horse and\nSepoys at once gave way; and the English infantry retreated, in great\ndisorder, to the fort of Trivadi, which they gained with a loss of\nfifteen killed and forty wounded. Peters' horse alone behaved well.\nSeveral times they charged right through the masses of Mysorean horse;\nbut when five-and-twenty were killed, and most of the rest, including\ntheir commander, severely wounded, they also fell back into the fort.\n\nColonel Coote, when the news of the disaster reached him, determined,\nif possible, to get possession of the fort of Vellenore, which stood\non the river Ariangopang, some three miles from Pondicherry, and\ncovered the approaches of the town from that side. The English\nencampment was at Perimbe, on the main road leading, through an avenue\nof trees, to Pondicherry. Colonel Coote threw up a redoubt on the hill\nbehind Perimbe, and another on the avenue, to check any French force\nadvancing from Pondicherry. These works were finished on the morning\nof the 19th of July.\n\nThe next morning the French army advanced along the river Ariangopang,\nbut Coote marched half his force to meet them, while he moved the rest\nas if to attack the redoubts, interspersed along the line of hedge. As\nthe fall of these would have placed the attacking force in his rear,\nLally at once returned to the town. The same evening the Mysoreans,\nwith three thousand bullocks carrying their artillery and drawing\ntheir baggage, and three thousand more laden with rice and other\nprovisions, arrived on the other bank of the Ariangopang river,\ncrossed under the guns of the redoubt of that name, and entered the\ntown.\n\nThe fort of Vellenore was strong, but the road had been cut straight\nthrough the glacis to the gate, and the French had neglected to erect\nworks to cover this passage. Coote took advantage of the oversight,\nand laid his two eighteen-pounders to play upon the gate, while two\nothers were placed to fire upon the parapet. The English batteries\nopened at daybreak on the 16th, and at nine o'clock the whole of the\nFrench army, with the Mysoreans, advanced along the bank of the river.\n\nCoote at once got his troops under arms, and advanced towards the\nFrench, sending a small detachment of Europeans to reinforce the\nSepoys firing at the fort of Vellenore. By this time the batteries had\nbeaten down the parapet, and silenced the enemy's fire. Two companies\nof Sepoys set forward, at full run, up to the very crest of the\nglacis.\n\nThe French commander of the place had really nothing to fear, as the\nSepoys had a ditch to pass, and a very imperfect breach to mount, and\nthe fort might have held out for two days, before the English could\nhave been in a position to storm it. The French army was in sight, and\nin ten minutes a general engagement would have begun. In spite of all\nthis, the coward at once hoisted a flag of truce, and surrendered. The\nEuropeans and Sepoys ran in through the gate, and the former instantly\nturned the guns of the fort upon the French army. This halted, struck\nwith amazement and anger, and Lally at once ordered it to retire upon\nthe town.\n\nA week afterwards six ships, with six hundred fresh troops from\nEngland, arrived.\n\nThe Mysoreans, who had brought food into Pondicherry, made many\nexcursions in the country, but were sharply checked. They were unable\nto supply themselves with food, and none could be spared them from the\nstores in the magazines. Great distress set in among them, and this\nwas heightened by the failure of a party, with two thousand bullocks\nwith rice, to enter the town. This party, escorted by the greater\nportion of the Mysorean horse from Pondicherry, was attacked and\ndefeated, and nine hundred bullocks, laden with baggage, captured.\nShortly afterwards the rest of the Mysorean troops left Pondicherry,\nand marched to attack Trinomany.\n\nSeeing that there was little fear of their returning to succour\nPondicherry, the English now determined to complete the blockade of\nthat place. In order to have any chance of reducing it by famine, it\nwas necessary to obtain possession of the country within the hedge;\nwhich, with its redoubts, extended in the arc of a circle from the\nriver Ariangopang to the sea. The space thus included contained an\narea of nearly seven square miles, affording pasture for the bullocks,\nof which there were sufficient to supply the troops and inhabitants\nfor many months. Therefore, although the army was not yet strong\nenough to open trenches against the town, and indeed the siege\nartillery had not yet sailed from Madras, it was determined to get\npossession of the hedge and its redoubts.\n\nBefore doing this, however, it was necessary to capture the fort of\nAriangopang. This was a difficult undertaking. The whole European\nforce was but two thousand strong, and if eight hundred of these were\ndetached across the river to attack the fort, the main body would be\nscarcely a match for the enemy, should he march out against them. If,\non the other hand, the whole army moved round to attack the fort, the\nenemy would be able to send out and fetch in the great convoy of\nprovisions collected at Jinji.\n\nMr. Pigot therefore requested Admiral Stevens to land the marines of\nthe fleet. Although, seeing that a large French fleet was expected,\nthe admiral was unwilling to weaken his squadron; he complied with the\nrequest, seeing the urgency of the case, and four hundred and twenty\nmarines were landed.\n\nOn the 2nd of September two more men-of-war, the America and Medway,\narrived, raising the fleet before Pondicherry to seventeen ships of\nthe line. They convoyed several Company's ships, who had brought with\nthem the wing of a Highland regiment.\n\nThe same evening Coote ordered four hundred men to march to invest the\nfort of Ariangopang; but Colonel Monson, second in command, was so\nstrongly against the step that, at the last moment, he countermanded\nhis orders. The change was fortunate, for Lally, who had heard from\nhis spies of the English intentions, moved his whole army out to\nattack the--as he supposed--weakened force.\n\nAt ten at night fourteen hundred French infantry, a hundred French\nhorse, and nine hundred Sepoys marched out to attack the English, who\nhad no suspicion of their intent. Two hundred marines and five hundred\nSepoys proceeded, in two columns. Marching from the Valdore redoubt,\none party turned to the right to attack the Tamarind redoubt, which\nthe English had erected on the Red Hill. Having taken this, they were\nto turn to their left and join the other column. This skirted the foot\nof the Red Hill, to attack the redoubt erected on a hillock at its\nfoot, on the 18th July.\n\nFour hundred Sepoys and a company of Portuguese were to take post at\nthe junction of the Valdore and Oulgarry avenues. The regiments of\nLorraine and Lally were to attack the battery in this avenue,\nLorraine's from the front, while Lally's, marching outwards in the\nfields, was to fall on its right flank. The Indian battalion, with the\nBourbon volunteers, three hundred strong, were to march from the fort\nof Ariangopang, across the river, to the villages under the fort of\nVellenore; and, as soon as the fire became general, were to fall upon\nthe right rear of the English encampment.\n\nAt midnight a rocket gave the signal, and the attack immediately\ncommenced. The attack on the Tamarind redoubt was repulsed, but the\nredoubt on the hillock was captured, and the guns spiked. At the\nintrenchment on the Oulgarry Road the fight was fierce, and Colonel\nCoote himself brought down his troops to its defence. The attack was\ncontinued, but as, owing to some mistake, the column intended to fall\nupon the English rear had halted, and did not arrive in time, the\nregiments of Lorraine and Lally drew off, and the whole force retired\nto the town.\n\nThe ships arriving from England brought a commission appointing Monson\nto the rank of Colonel, with a date prior to that of Colonel Coote;\nordering him, however, not to assert his seniority, so long as Coote\nremained at Madras. Coote, however, considered that it was intended\nthat he should return to Bengal, and so handing over the command to\nMonson, he went back to Madras.\n\nColonel Monson at once prepared to attack the hedge, and its redoubts.\nLeaving sufficient guards for the camp, he advanced at midnight, with\nhis troops divided into two brigades, the one commanded by himself,\nthe other by Major Smith. Major Smith's division was first to attack\nthe enemy, outside the hedge in the village of Oulgarry; and, driving\nthem hence, to carry the Vellenore redoubt, while the main body were\nto make a sweep round the Red Hill, and come down to the attack of the\nValdore redoubt.\n\nSmith, moving to the right of the Oulgarry avenue, attacked that\nposition on the left; and the advance, led by Captain Myers, carried\nby storm a redoubt in front of the village, and seized four pieces of\ncannon. Major Smith, heading his grenadiers, then charged the village,\ntore down all obstacles, and carried the place.\n\nThe day had begun to dawn when Colonel Monson approached the Valdore\nredoubt. But at the last moment, making a mistake in their way, the\nhead of the column halted. At this moment the enemy perceived them,\nand discharged a twenty-four pounder, loaded with small shot, into the\ncolumn. Eleven men were killed and twenty-six wounded by this terrible\ndischarge, among the latter Colonel Monson himself, his leg being\nbroken. The grenadiers now rushed furiously to the attack, swarmed\nround the redoubt and, although several times repulsed, at last forced\ntheir way through the embrasures and captured the position.\n\nThe defenders of the village of Oulgarry had halted outside the\nVellenore redoubt; but, upon hearing the firing to their right,\nretreated hastily within it. Major Smith pressed them hotly with his\nbrigade, and followed so closely upon their heels that they did not\nstop to defend the position, but retreated to the town. Major Smith\nwas soon joined by the Highlanders, under Major Scott, who had forced\na way through the hedge between the two captured redoubts.\n\nThus the whole line of the outer defence fell into the hands of the\nEnglish, with the exception of the Ariangopang redoubt on the left,\nwhich was held by the India regiment. Major Gordon, who now took the\ncommand, placed the Bombay detachment, of three hundred and fifty men,\nin the captured redoubts; and encamped the whole of the force in the\nfields to the right of Oulgarry.\n\nMajor Smith advised that at least a thousand men should be left, near\nat hand, to succour the garrisons of the redoubts; which, being open\nat the rear, were liable to an attack. Major Gordon foolishly refused\nto follow his advice, and the same night the French attacked the\nredoubts. The Bombay troops, however, defended themselves with extreme\nbravery until assistance arrived.\n\nThree days later the French evacuated and blew up the fort of\nAriangopang, which the English were preparing to attack, and the India\nregiment retired into the town, leaving, however, the usual guard in\nthe Ariangopang redoubt.\n\nColonel Coote had scarcely arrived at Madras when he received a letter\nfrom Colonel Monson, saying that he was likely to be incapacitated by\nhis wound for some months, and requesting that he would resume the\ncommand of the army. The authorities of Madras strongly urged Coote to\nreturn, representing the extreme importance of the struggle in which\nthey were engaged. He consented, and reached camp on the night of the\n20th. He at once ordered the captured redoubts to be fortified, to\nprevent the enemy again taking the offensive; and erected a strong\nwork, called the North Redoubt, near the seashore and facing the\nMadras redoubt.\n\nA few days later, on a party of Sepoys approaching the Ariangopang\nredoubt, the occupants of that place were seized with a panic,\nabandoned the place, and went into the town. The English had now\npossession of the whole of the outward defences of Pondicherry, with\nthe exception of the two redoubts by the seashore.\n\nA day or two later Colonel Coote, advancing along the sea beach as if\nwith a view of merely making a reconnaissance, pushed on suddenly,\nentered the village called the Blancherie, as it was principally\ninhabited by washerwomen, and attacked the Madras redoubt. This was\ncarried, but the same night the garrison sallied out again, and fell\nupon the party of Sepoys posted there. Ensign MacMahon was killed, but\nthe Sepoys, although driven out from the redoubt, bravely returned and\nagain attacked the French; who, thinking that the Sepoys must have\nreceived large reinforcements, fell back into the village; from which,\na day or two later, they retired into the town.\n\nThe whole of the ground outside the fort, between the river\nAriangopang and the sea, was now in the hands of the English. The\nFrench still maintained their communications with the south by the\nsandy line of coast. By this time the attacks, which the English from\nTrichinopoli and Madura had made upon the Mysoreans, had compelled the\nlatter to make peace, and recall their army, which was still hovering\nin the neighbourhood of Pondicherry.\n\nCharlie, who had been suffering from a slight attack of fever, had for\nsome time been staying on board ship, for change. In the road of\nPondicherry three of the French Indiamen, the Hermione, Baleine, and\nthe Compagnie des Indes, were at anchor, near the edge of the surf,\nunder the cover of a hundred guns mounted on the sea face of the fort.\nThese ships were awaiting the stormy weather, at the breaking of the\nmonsoon, when it would be difficult for the English fleet to maintain\ntheir position off the town. They then intended to sail away to the\nsouth, fill up with provisions, and return to Pondicherry.\n\nAdmiral Stevens, in order to prevent this contingency, which would\nhave greatly delayed the reduction of the place, determined to cut\nthem out. Charlie's health being much restored by the sea breezes, he\nasked leave of the admiral to accompany the expedition, as a\nvolunteer. On the evening of the 6th, six-and-twenty of the boats of\nthe fleet, manned by four hundred sailors, were lowered and rowed to\nthe Tiger, which was at anchor within two miles of Pondicherry, the\nrest of the fleet lying some distance farther away.\n\nWhen, at midnight, the cabin lights of the Hermione were extinguished,\nthe expedition started. The boats moved in two divisions, one of which\nwas to attack the Hermione, the other the Baleine. The third vessel\nlay nearer in shore, and was to be attacked if the others were\ncaptured.\n\nThe night was a very dark one, and the boats of each division moved in\nline, with ropes stretched from boat to boat, to ensure their keeping\ntogether in the right direction. Charlie was in one of the boats\nintended to attack the Hermione. Tim accompanied him, but the admiral\nhad refused permission for Hossein to do so, as there were many more\nwhite volunteers for the service than the boats would accommodate.\nThey were within fifty yards of the Hermione before they were\ndiscovered, and a scattering musket fire was at once opened upon them.\n\nThe crews gave a mighty cheer and, casting off the ropes, separated;\nfive making for each side of the ship, while two rowed forward to cut\nthe cables at her bows. The Compagnie des Indes opened fire upon the\nboats, but these were already alongside the ship, and the sailors\nswarmed over the side at ten points.\n\nThe combat was a short one. The seventy men on board fought bravely,\nfor a minute or two, but they were speedily driven below. The hatches\nwere closed over them, and the cables being already cut, the mizzen\ntopsail, the only sail bent, was hoisted; and the boats, taking\ntowropes, began to row her away from shore.\n\nThe instant, however, that the cessation of fire informed the garrison\nthe ship was captured, a tremendous cannonade was opened by the guns\nof the fortress. The lightning was flashing vividly, and this enabled\nthe gunners to direct their aim upon the ship. Over and over again she\nwas struck, and one shot destroyed the steering wheel, cut the tiller\nrope, and killed two men who were steering. The single sail was not\nsufficient to assist in steering her, and the men in the boats rowed\nwith such energy that the ropes continually snapped.\n\nThe fire continued from the shore, doing considerable damage; and the\nmen in the boats, who could not see that the ship was moving through\nthe water, concluded that she was anchored by a concealed cable and\nanchor. The officer in command, therefore, called up the Frenchmen\nfrom below, telling them he was about to fire the ship. They came on\ndeck and took their places in the boats, which rowed back to the\nTiger.\n\nUpon arriving there Captain Dent, who commanded her, sternly rebuked\nthe officer; and said that, unless the boats returned instantly and\nbrought the Hermione out, he should send his own crew in their boats\nto fetch her. The division thereupon returned, and met the ship half a\nmile off shore, the land wind having now sprung up.\n\nThe Baleine had been easily captured and, having several sails bent,\nshe was brought out without difficulty. No attempt was made to capture\nthe third vessel.\n\nThe rains had now set in, but the English laboured steadily at their\nbatteries. The French were becoming pressed for provisions, and Lally\nturned the whole of the natives remaining in the town, to the number\nof fourteen hundred men and women, outside the fortifications. On\ntheir arrival at the English lines they were refused permission to\npass, as Colonel Coote did not wish to relieve the garrison of the\nconsumption of food caused by them. They returned to the French lines,\nand begged to be again received; but they were, by Lally's orders,\nfired upon, and several killed.\n\nFor seven days the unhappy wretches remained without food, save the\nroots they could gather in the fields. Then Colonel Coote, seeing that\nLally was inflexible, allowed them to pass.\n\nOn the 10th of November the batteries opened, and every day added to\nthe strength of the fire upon the town. The fortifications, however,\nwere strong, and the siege progressed but slowly. On the 30th of\nDecember a tremendous storm burst, and committed the greatest havoc,\nboth at land and sea. The Newcastle, man-of-war; the Queenborough,\nfrigate; and the Protector, fire ship were driven ashore and dashed to\npieces; but the crews, with the exception of seven, were saved. The\nDuke of Aquitaine, the Sunderland, and the Duke, store ship, were\nsunk, and eleven hundred sailors drowned. Most of the other ships were\ndismasted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30. Home.\n\n\nThe fire of the batteries increased, and by the 13th of January the\nenemy's fire was completely silenced. The provisions in the town were\nwholly exhausted, and on the 16th the town surrendered, and the next\nmorning the English took possession. Three days afterwards Lally was\nembarked on board ship, to be taken a prisoner to Madras; and so much\nwas he hated that the French officers and civilians assembled, and\nhissed and hooted him; and, had he not been protected by his guard,\nwould have torn him to pieces. After his return to France he was tried\nfor having, by his conduct, caused the loss of the French possessions\nin India, and being found guilty of the offence, was beheaded.\n\nAt Pondicherry two thousand and seventy-two military prisoners were\ntaken, and three hundred and eighty-one civilians. Five hundred cannon\nand a hundred mortars, fit for service; and immense quantities of\nammunition, arms, and military stores fell into the hands of the\ncaptors.\n\nPondicherry was handed over to the Company; who, a short time\nafterwards, entirely demolished both the fortress and town. This hard\nmeasure was the consequence of a letter which had been intercepted,\nfrom the French government to Lally, ordering him to raze Madras to\nthe ground, when it fell into his hands.\n\nCharlie, after the siege, in which he had rendered great services,\nreceived from the Company, at Colonel Coote's earnest recommendation,\nhis promotion to the step of lieutenant colonel; while Peters was\nraised to that of major. A fortnight after the fall of Pondicherry,\nthey returned to Madras, and thence took the first ship for England.\nIt was now just ten years since they had sailed, and in that time they\nhad seen Madras and Calcutta rise, from the rank of two trading\nstations, in constant danger of destruction by their powerful\nneighbours, to that of virtual capitals of great provinces. Not as\nyet, indeed, had they openly assumed the sovereignty of these\nterritories; but Madras was, in fact, the absolute master of the broad\ntract of land extending from the foot of the mountains to the sea,\nfrom Cape Comorin to Bengal; while Calcutta was master of Bengal and\nOressa, and her power already threatened to extend itself as far as\nDelhi. The conquest of these vast tracts of country had been achieved\nby mere handfuls of men, and by a display of heroic valour and\nconstancy scarce to be rivalled in the history of the world.\n\nThe voyage was a pleasant one, and was, for the times, quick,\noccupying only five months. But to the young men, longing for home\nafter so long an absence, it seemed tedious in the extreme.\n\nTim and Hossein were well content with their quiet, easy life, after\ntheir long toils. They had nothing whatever to do, except that they\ninsisted upon waiting upon Charlie and Peters, at meals. The ship\ncarried a large number of sick and wounded officers and men, and as\nthese gained health and strength, the life on board ship became\nlivelier, and more jovial. Singing and cards occupied the evenings,\nwhile in the daytime they played quoits, rings of rope being used for\nthat purpose, and other games with which passengers usually wile away\nthe monotony of long voyages.\n\nIt was late in June when the Madras sailed up the Thames; and, as soon\nas she came to anchor, the two officers and their followers landed.\nThe din and bustle of the streets seemed almost as strange, to\nCharlie, as they had done when he came up a boy, from Yarmouth.\nHossein was astonished at the multitude of white people, and inquired\nof Charlie why, when there were so many men, England had sent so few\nsoldiers to fight for her in India; and for once, Charlie was unable\nto give a satisfactory reply.\n\n\"It does seem strange,\" he said to Peters, \"that when such mighty\ninterests were at stake, a body of even ten thousand troops could not\nhave been raised, and sent out. Such a force would have decided the\nstruggle at once; and in three months the great possessions, which\nhave cost the Company twelve years' war, would have been at their\nfeet. It would not have cost them more; indeed, nothing like as much\nas it now has done, nor one tithe of the loss in life. Somehow,\nEngland always seems to make war in driblets.\"\n\nCharlie knew that his mother and Kate had, for some years, been\nresiding at a house which their uncle had taken, in the fashionable\nquarter of Chelsea. They looked in at the office, however, to see if\nCharlie's uncle was there; but found that he was not in the city, and,\nindeed, had now almost retired from the business. They therefore took\na coach, placed the small articles of luggage which they had brought\nwith them, from the ship, on the front seats; and then, Hossein and\nTim taking their places on the broad seat beside the driver, they\nentered the coach and drove to Chelsea.\n\nCharlie had invited Peters, who had no home of his own, to stay with\nhim, at least for a while. Both were now rich men, from their shares\nof the prize money of the various forts and towns, in whose capture\nthey had taken part; although Charlie possessed some twenty thousand\npounds more than his friend, this being the amount of the presents he\nhad received, from the Rajah of Ambur.\n\nAlighting from the carriage, Charlie ran up to the door and knocked.\nInquiring for Mrs. Marryat, he was shown into a room in which a lady,\nsomewhat past middle age, and three younger ones were sitting. They\nlooked up, in surprise, as the young man entered. Ten years had\nchanged him almost beyond recognition, but one of the younger ones at\nonce leaped to her feet, and exclaimed, \"Charlie!\"\n\nHis mother rose with a cry of joy, and threw herself into his arms.\nAfter rapturously kissing her, he turned to the others. Their faces\nwere changed, yet all seemed equally familiar to him, and in his\ndelight he equally embraced them all.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, when he freed himself from their arms. \"Why,\nthere are three of you! What on earth am I doing? I have somebody's\npardon to beg; and yet, although your faces are changed, they seem\nequally familiar to me. Which is it?\n\n\"But I need not ask,\" he said, as a cloud of colour flowed over the\nface of one of the girls, while the others smiled mischievously.\n\n\"You are Katie,\" he said, \"and you are Lizzie, certainly, and this\nis--why, it is Ada!\n\n\"This is a surprise, indeed; but I sha'n't beg your pardon, Ada, for I\nkissed you at parting, and quite intended to do so when I met again,\nat least if you had offered no violent objection.\n\n\"How you are all grown and changed, while you, Mother, look scarcely\nolder than when I left you.\n\n\"But there, I have quite forgotten Peters. He has come home with me,\nand will stay till he has formed his own plans.\"\n\nHe hurried out and brought in Peters; who, not wishing to be present\nat the family meeting, had been paying the coachman, and seeing to the\nthings being brought into the house. He was warmly received, by the\nladies, as the friend and companion of Charlie in his adventures;\nscarcely a letter having been received, from the latter, without\nmention having been made of his comrade.\n\nIn a minute or two Mr. Tufton, who had been in the large garden behind\nthe house, hurried in. He was now quite an old man; and under the\ninfluence of age, and the cheerful society of Mrs. Marryat and her\ndaughters, he had lost much of the pomposity which had before\ndistinguished him.\n\n\"Ah! Nephew,\" he said, when the happy party had sat down to dinner,\ntheir number increased by the arrival of Mrs. Haines, who had a house\nclose by; \"wilful lads will go their own way. I wanted to make a rich\nmerchant of you, and you have made of yourself a famous soldier. But\nyou've not done badly for yourself after all; for you have, in your\nletters, often talked about prize money.\"\n\n\"Yes, Uncle. I have earned, in my way, close upon a hundred thousand\npounds; and I certainly shouldn't have made that if I had stuck to the\noffice at Madras, even with the aid of the capital you offered to lend\nme, to trade with on my own account.\"\n\nThere was a general exclamation of surprise and pleasure, at the\nmention of the sum; although this amount was small, in comparison to\nthat which many acquired, in those days, in India.\n\n\"And you're not thinking of going back again, Charlie?\" his mother\nsaid, anxiously. \"There can be no longer any reason for your exposing\nyourself to that horrible climate, and that constant fighting.\"\n\n\"The climate is not so bad, Mother, and the danger and excitement of a\nsoldier's life there, at present, render it very fascinating. But I\nhave done with it. Peters and I intend, on the expiration of our\nleave, to resign our commissions in the Company's service, and to\nsettle down under our own vines and fig trees. Tim has already elected\nhimself to the post of my butler, and Hossein intends to be my valet\nand body servant.\"\n\nImmediately after their arrival, Charlie had brought in his faithful\nfollowers and introduced them to the ladies; who, having often heard\nof their devotion and faithful services, had received them with a\nkindness and cordiality which had delighted them.\n\nLizzie, whose appearance at home had been unexpected by Charlie, for\nher husband was a landed gentleman at Seven Oaks, in Kent, was, it\nappeared, paying a visit of a week to her mother; and her three\nchildren, two boys and a little girl, were duly brought down to be\nshown to, and admired by, their Uncle Charles.\n\n\"And how is it you haven't married, Katie? With such a pretty face as\nyours, it is scandalous that the men have allowed you to reach the\nmature age of twenty-two, unmarried.\"\n\n\"It is the fault of the hussy herself,\" Mr. Tufton said. \"It is not\nfrom want of offers, for she has had a dozen, and among them some of\nthe nobility at court; for it is well known that John Tufton's niece\nwill have a dowry such as many of the nobles could not give, to their\ndaughters.\"\n\n\"This is too bad, Kate,\" Charlie said, laughing. \"What excuse have you\nto make for yourself for remaining single, with all these advantages\nof face and fortune?\"\n\n\"Simply that I didn't like any of them,\" Katie said. \"The beaux of the\npresent day are contemptible. I would as soon think of marrying a wax\ndoll. When I do marry; that is, if ever I do, it shall be a man, and\nnot a mere tailor's dummy.\"\n\n\"You are pert, miss,\" her uncle said.\n\n\"Do what I will, Charlie, I cannot teach the hussy to order her\ntongue.\"\n\n\"Katie's quite right, Uncle,\" Charlie laughed. \"And I must make it my\nduty to find a man who will suit her taste; though, according to your\naccount of her, he will find it a hard task to keep such a Xanthippe\nin order.\"\n\nKatie tossed her head.\n\n\"He'd better not try,\" she said saucily, \"or it will be worse for\nhim.\"\n\nTwo days later, Charlie's elder sister returned with her family to her\nhouse at Sevenoaks; where Charlie promised, before long, to pay her a\nvisit. After she had gone, Charlie and Peters, with Katie, made a\nseries of excursions to all the points of interest, round London; and\non these occasions Ada usually accompanied them.\n\nThe natural consequences followed. Charlie had, for years, been the\nhero of Ada's thoughts; while Katie had heard so frequently of Peters\nthat she was, from the first, disposed to regard him in the most\nfavourable light. Before the end of two months, both couples were\nengaged; and as both the young officers possessed ample means, and the\nladies were heiresses, there was no obstacle to an early union.\n\nThe weddings took place a month later; and Tim was, in the exuberance\nof his delight, hilariously drunk for the first and only time during\nhis service with Charlie. Both gentlemen bought estates in the\ncountry, and later took their seats in Parliament, where they\nvigorously defended their former commander, Lord Clive, in the\nassaults which were made upon him.\n\nTim married, seven or eight years after his master, and settled down\nin a nice little house upon the estate. Although, henceforth, he did\nno work whatever; he insisted, to the end of his life, that he was\nstill in Colonel Marryat's service.\n\nHossein, to the great amusement of his master and mistress, followed\nTim's example. The pretty cook of Charlie's establishment made no\nobjection to his swarthy hue. Charlie built a snug cottage for them,\nclose to the house, where they took up their residence; but Hossein,\nthough the happy father of a large family, continued, to the end of a\nlong life, to discharge the duties of valet to his master.\n\nBoth he and Tim were immense favourites with the children of Charlie\nand Peters, who were never tired of listening to their tales of the\nexploits of their fathers, when with Clive in India.\n",
