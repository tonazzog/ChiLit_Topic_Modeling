  "content": "The Settlers in Canada\nCaptain Frederick Marryat\n\n\n[BEE-HUNTING.]\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was in the year 1794, that an English family went out to settle in\nCanada. This province had been surrendered to us by the French, who\nfirst colonized it, more than thirty years previous to the year I have\nmentioned. It must, however, be recollected, that to emigrate and settle\nin Canada was, at that time, a very different affair to what it is now.\nThe difficulty of transport, and the dangers incurred, were much\ngreater, for there were no steamboats to stem the currents and the\nrapids of the rivers; the Indians were still residing in Upper and many\nportions of Lower Canada, and the country was infested with wild animals\nof every description--some useful, but many dangerous: moreover, the\nEuropeans were fewer in number, and the major portion of them were\nFrench, who were not pleased at the country having been conquered by the\nEnglish. It is true that a great many English settlers had arrived, and\nhad settled upon different farms; but as the French settlers had already\npossession of all the best land in Lower Canada, these new settlers were\nobliged to go into or toward Upper Canada, where, although the land was\nbetter, the distance from Quebec and Montreal, and other populous parts,\nwas much greater, and they were left almost wholly to their own\nresources, and almost without protection. I mention all this, because\nthings are so very different at present: and now I shall state the cause\nwhich induced this family to leave their home, and run the risk and\ndangers which they did.\n\nMr. Campbell was of a good parentage, but, being the son of one of the\nyounger branches of the family, his father was not rich, and Mr.\nCampbell was, of course, brought up to a profession. Mr. Campbell chose\nthat of a surgeon; and after having walked the hospitals (as it is\ntermed), he set up in business and in a few years was considered as a\nvery able man in his profession. His practice increased very fast; and\nbefore he was thirty years of age he married.\n\nMr. Campbell had an only sister, who resided with him, for their father\nand mother were both dead. But about five years after his own marriage,\na young gentleman paid his addresses to her; and although not rich, as\nhis character was unexceptionable, and his prospects good, he was\naccepted. Miss Campbell changed her name to Percival, and left her\nbrother's house to follow her husband.\n\nTime passed quickly; and, at the end of ten years, Mr. Campbell found\nhimself with a flourishing business, and at the same time with a family\nto support, his wife having presented him with four boys, of whom the\nyoungest was but a few months old.\n\nBut, although prosperous in his own affairs, one heavy misfortune fell\nupon Mr. Campbell, which was the loss of his sister, Mrs. Percival, to\nwhom he was most sincerely attached. Her loss was attended with\ncircumstances which rendered it more painful, as, previous to her\ndecease, the house of business in which Mr. Percival was a partner\nfailed; and the incessant toil and anxiety which Mr. Percival underwent\nbrought on a violent fever, which ended in his death. In this state of\ndistress, left a widow with one child of two years old--a little\ngirl--and with the expectation of being shortly again confined, Mrs.\nPercival was brought to her brother's house, who, with his wife, did all\nhe could to soften down her grief; but she had suffered so much by the\nloss of her husband, that when the period arrived, her strength was\ngone, and she died in giving birth to a second daughter. Mr. and Mrs.\nCampbell, of course, took charge of these two little orphan girls, and\nbrought them up with their own children.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs about ten or eleven years after Mr.\nCampbell's marriage, when a circumstance occurred as unexpected as it\nwas welcome.\n\nMr. Campbell had returned from his round of professional visits; dinner\nwas over, and he was sitting at the table with his wife and elder\nchildren (for it was the Christmas holidays, and they were all at home),\nand the bell had just rung for the nurse to bring down the two little\ngirls and the youngest boy, when the postman rapped at the door, and the\nparlor-maid brought in a letter with a large black seal. Mr. Campbell\nopened it, and read as follows:--\n\n     Sir--We have great pleasure in making known to you, that upon the\n     demise of Mr. Sholto Campbell, of Wexton Hall, Cumberland, which\n     took place on the 19th ultimo, the entailed estates, in default of\n     more direct issue, have fallen to you, as nearest of kin; the\n     presumptive heir having perished at sea, or in the East Indies, and\n     not having been heard of for twenty-five years. We beg to be the\n     first to congratulate you upon your accession to real property\n     amounting to £14,000 per annum. No will has been found, and it has\n     been ascertained that none was ever made by the late Mr. Sholto\n     Campbell. We have, therefore, put seals upon the personal property,\n     and shall wait your pleasure. We can only add, that if in want of\n     professional advice, and not being already engaged, you may command\n     the services of\n                                            Your most obedient,\n                                   HARVEY, PAXTON, THORPE, & Co.\n\n\"What can be the matter, my dear?\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell, who had\nperceived most unusual agitation in her husband's countenance.\n\nMr. Campbell made no reply, but handed the letter to his wife.\n\nMrs. Campbell read it, and laid it down on the table.\n\n\"Well, my dear!\" exclaimed Mr. Campbell, joyfully, and starting up from\nhis chair.\n\n\"It is a sudden shock, indeed,\" observed Mrs. Campbell, thoughtfully and\nslowly. \"I have often felt that we could bear up against any adversity.\nI trust in God, that we may be as well able to support prosperity, by\nfar the hardest task, my dear Campbell, of the two.\"\n\n\"You are right, Emily,\" replied Mr. Campbell, sitting down again; \"we\nare, and have long been, happy.\"\n\n\"This sudden wealth can not add to our happiness, my dear husband; I\nfeel it will rather add to our cares; but it may enable us to add to the\nhappiness of others; and with such feelings, let us receive it with\nthankfulness.\"\n\n\"Very true, Emily; but still we must do our duty in that station of life\nto which it has pleased God to call us. Hitherto I have by my profession\nbeen of some benefit to my fellow-creatures; and if in my change of\ncondition I no more leave my warm bed to relieve their sufferings, at\nall events, I shall have the means of employing others so to do. We must\nconsider ourselves but as the stewards of Him who has bestowed this\ngreat wealth upon us, and employ it as may be acceptable to His\nservice.\"\n\n\"There my husband spoke as I felt he would,\" said Mrs. Campbell, rising\nup, and embracing him. \"Those who feel as you do can never be too rich.\"\n\nI must not dwell too long upon this portion of my narrative. I shall\ntherefore observe that Mr. Campbell took possession of Wexton Hall, and\nlived in a style corresponding to his increased fortune; but, at the\nsame time, he never let pass an opportunity of doing good, and in this\ntask he was ably assisted by his wife. They had not resided there three\nor four years before they were considered as a blessing to all around\nthem--encouraging industry, assisting the unfortunate, relieving the\nindigent, building almshouses and schools, and doing all in their power\nto promote the welfare and add to the happiness of those within many\nmiles of the Hall. At the time that Mr. Campbell took possession, the\nestate had been neglected, and required large sums to be laid out upon\nit, which would much increase its value.\n\nThus all the large income of Mr. Campbell was usefully and\nadvantageously employed. The change in Mr. Campbell's fortune had also\nmuch changed the prospects of his children. Henry, the eldest, who had\nbeen intended for his father's profession, was first sent to a private\ntutor, and afterward to college. Alfred, the second boy, had chosen the\nnavy for his profession, and had embarked on board a fine frigate. The\nother two boys, one named Percival, who was more than two years old at\nthe time that they took possession of the property, and the other, John,\nwho had been born only a few months, remained at home, receiving tuition\nfrom a young curate, who lived near the Hall; while a governess had been\nprocured for Mary and Emma Percival, who were growing up very handsome\nand intelligent girls.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs at the time when Mr. Campbell had been\nabout ten years in possession of the Wexton estate, when one day he was\ncalled upon by Mr. Harvey, the head of the firm which had announced to\nhim his succession to the property.\n\nMr. Harvey came to inform him that a claimant had appeared, and given\nnotice of his intent to file a bill in Chancery to recover the estate,\nbeing, as he asserted, the son of the person who had been considered as\nthe presumptive heir, and who had perished so many years back. Mr.\nHarvey observed, that although he thought it his duty to make the\ncircumstance known to Mr. Campbell, he considered it as a matter of no\nconsequence, and in all probability would turn out to be a fraud got up\nby some petty attorney, with a view to a compromise. He requested Mr.\nCampbell not to allow the circumstance to give him any annoyance,\nstating that if more was heard of it, Mr. Campbell should be immediately\ninformed. Satisfied with the opinion of Mr. Harvey, Mr. Campbell\ndismissed the circumstance from his mind, and did not even mention it to\nhis wife.\n\nBut three months had not passed away before Mr. Campbell received a\nletter from his solicitor, in which he informed him that the claim to\nthe estate was carrying on with great vigor, and he was sorry to add,\nwore (to use his own term) a very ugly appearance; and that the opposite\nparties would, at all events, put Mr. Campbell to a very considerable\nexpense. The solicitor requested Mr. Campbell's instructions, again\nasserting, that although it was artfully got up, he considered that it\nwas a fraudulent attempt. Mr. Campbell returned an answer, in which he\nauthorized his solicitor to take every needful precaution, and to incur\nall necessary expense. On reflection, Mr. Campbell, although much\nannoyed, determined not to make Mrs. Campbell acquainted with what was\ngoing on; it could only distress her, he thought, and he therefore\nresolved for the present to leave her in ignorance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nAfter a delay of some months, Mr. Harvey called upon Mr. Campbell, and\nstated to him that the claim of the opposite party, so far from being\nfraudulent as he had supposed, was so clear, that he feared the worst\nresults.\n\nIt appeared that the heir to the estates, who had remained between Mr.\nCampbell's title, had married in India, and had subsequently, as it had\nbeen supposed, died; but there was full and satisfactory proof that the\nmarriage was valid, and that the party who claimed was his son. It was\ntrue, Mr. Harvey observed, that Mr. Campbell might delay for some time\nthe restoration of the property, but that eventually it must be\nsurrendered.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Campbell received this letter, he went to his wife and\nacquainted her with all that had been going on for some months, and with\nthe reasons which induced him to say nothing to her until the receipt of\nMr. Harvey's letter, which he now put into her hands, requesting her\nopinion on the subject. Mrs. Campbell, after having read the letter,\nreplied--\n\n\"It appears, my dear husband, that we have been called to take\npossession of a property, and to hold for many years that which belongs\nto another. We are now called upon to give it up to the rightful owner.\nYou ask my opinion; surely there is no occasion to do that. We must of\ncourse now, that we know the claim is just, do as we would be done by.\"\n\n\"That is, my dearest, we must surrender it at once, without any more\nlitigation. It certainly has been my feeling ever since I have read Mr.\nHarvey's letter. Yet it is hard to be beggars.\"\n\n\"It _is_ hard, my dear husband, if we may use that term; but, at the\nsame time, it is the will of Heaven. We received the property supposing\nit to have been our own; we have, I hope, not misused it during the time\nit has been intrusted to us; and, since it pleases Heaven that we should\nbe deprived of it, let us, at all events, have the satisfaction of\nacting conscientiously and justly, and trust to Him for our future\nsupport.\"\n\n\"I will write immediately,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"to acquaint Mr.\nHarvey, that although I litigated the point as long as the claim was\nconsidered doubtful, now that he informs me that the other party is the\nlegal heir, I beg that all proceedings may be stopped, as I am willing\nto give immediate possession.\"\n\n\"Do so, my dear,\" replied his wife, embracing him. \"We may be poor, but\nI trust we shall still be happy.\"\n\nMr. Campbell sat down and wrote the letter of instructions to his\nsolicitor, sealed it, and sent a groom with it to the post.\n\nAs soon as the servant had closed the door of the room, Mr. Campbell\ncovered his face with his hands.\n\n\"It is, indeed, a severe trial,\" said Mrs. Campbell, taking the hand of\nher husband; \"but you have done your duty.\"\n\n\"I care not for myself; I am thinking of my children.\"\n\n\"They must work,\" replied Mrs. Campbell. \"Employment is happiness.\"\n\n\"Yes, the boys may get on; but those poor girls! what a change will it\nbe for them!\"\n\n\"I trust they have not been so badly brought up, Campbell, but that they\nwill submit with cheerfulness, and be a source of comfort to us both.\nBesides, we may not be absolutely beggars.\"\n\n\"That depends upon the other party. He may claim all arrears of rent;\nand if so, we are more than beggars. However, God's will be done. Shall\nwe receive good, and shall we not receive evil?\"\n\n\"There's hope, my husband,\" replied Mrs. Campbell, in a cheering tone;\n\"let us hope for the best.\"\n\n\"How little do we know what is for our good, short-sighted mortals as we\nare!\" observed Mr. Campbell. \"Had not this estate come to us, I should,\nby following up my profession as surgeon, in all probability, have\nrealized a good provision for my children: now, this seeming good turn\nof fortune leaves me poor. I am too old now to resume my profession,\nand, if I did, have no chance of obtaining the practice which I left.\nYou see that which appeared to us and every one else the most fortunate\noccurrence in my life, has eventually proved the contrary.\"\n\n\"As far as our limited view of things can enable us to judge, I grant\nit,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"but who knows what might have happened if\nwe had remained in possession? All is hidden from our view. _He_ acts as\nhe thinks best for us; and it is for us to submit without repining.\nCome, dearest, let us walk out; the air is fresh, and will cool your\nheated brow.\"\n\nTwo days after this conversation, a letter was received from Mr. Harvey,\ninforming them that he had made known Mr. Campbell's determination to\nresign the property without further litigation; that the reply of the\nother party was highly honorable, stating that it was not his intention\nto make any claim for the back rents, and requesting that Mr. Campbell\nand family would consider Wexton Hall at their disposal for three\nmonths, to enable them to make arrangements, and dispose of their\nfurniture, etc.\n\nThe contents of this letter were a great relief to the mind of Mr.\nCampbell, as he was now able to ascertain what his future means might\nbe, and was grateful for the handsome behavior of the new proprietor in\nnot making any claim for back rents, which would have reduced him at\nonce to penury. He wrote immediately to Mr. Harvey requesting him to\nsend in his account of legal expenses, that it might be liquidated as\nsoon as possible. In three days it arrived, and a letter with it, in\nwhich Mr. Harvey acquainted him, that it was in consequence of his\nhaving so handsomely surrendered the property as soon as the claim was\nsubstantiated, together with the knowledge how much the estate had been\nimproved during the ten years in which it had been in his possession,\nwhich induced the new proprietor to behave in so liberal a manner. This\nwas very gratifying to Mr. Campbell, but the legal expenses proved\nenormous, amounting to many thousand pounds.\n\nMr. Campbell read the sum total, and threw the heap of papers down on\nthe table in despair.\n\n\"We are still ruined, my dear,\" said he mournfully.\n\n\"Let us hope _not_,\" replied Mrs. Campbell. \"At all events, we now know\nthe worst of it, and we must look it boldly in the face.\"\n\n\"I have not so much money as will pay this bill by nearly a thousand\npounds, my dearest wife.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"but still there is the\nfurniture, the horses, and carriages; surely, they are worth much more.\"\n\n\"But we have other bills to pay; you forget them.\"\n\n\"No, I do not; I have been collecting them all, and they do not amount\nto more than 300_l._ as near as I can judge; but we have no time to\nlose, dearest, and we must show courage.\"\n\n\"What then do you advise, Emily?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"We must incur no more expense; our present establishment must be\ndismissed at once. Send for all the servants to-morrow morning, and\nexplain what has occurred. This evening I will make it known to the two\ngirls and Miss Paterson, who must of course be discharged, as we can no\nlonger afford a governess. We must retain only the cook, housemaid, and\nfootman, and a groom to look after the horses until they are sold. Send\na letter to Mr. Bates, the auctioneer, to give notice of an early sale\nof the furniture. You must write to Henry; of course, he can no longer\nremain at college. We have plenty of time to consider what shall be our\nfuture plans, which must depend much upon what may prove to be our\nfuture means.\"\n\nThis judicious advice was approved of by Mr. Campbell. Miss Paterson was\ngreatly distressed when the news was communicated to her by Mrs.\nCampbell. Mary and Emma Percival felt deeply for their kind\nbenefactors, but thought nothing of themselves. As Mrs. Campbell had\ntruly observed, they had been too well brought up. As soon as they were\ninformed of what had happened, they both ran to Mr. Campbell's room, and\nhung upon his neck, declaring they would do all they could to make him\nhappy, and work for him, if necessary, from morning till night.\n\nThe next day the whole household were summoned into the dining-room, and\nmade acquainted by Mr. Campbell with what had taken place, and the\nnecessity of their immediate removal. Their wages had been calculated,\nand were paid them before they quitted the room, which they all did with\nmany expressions of regret. Miss Paterson requested leave to remain with\nthem as a friend for a few days longer, and as she was deservedly a\nfavorite, her request was acceded to.\n\n\"Thank heaven, that is over!\" said Mr. Campbell, after all the household\nhad been dismissed. \"It is quite a relief to my mind.\"\n\n\"Here's a letter from Alfred, uncle,\" said Emma Percival, entering the\nroom. \"He has just arrived at Portsmouth, and says the ship is ordered\nto be paid off immediately, and his captain is appointed to a fifty-gun\nship, and intends to take him with him. He says he will be here in a few\ndays, and\"----\n\n\"And what, dearest?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"He says his time will be short, but he hopes you won't object to his\nbringing two of his messmates down with him.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow! I am sorry that he will be disappointed,\" replied Mr.\nCampbell. \"You must write to him, Emma, and tell him what has happened.\"\n\n\"I must write to him, uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear Emma, do you write to him,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"your\nuncle and I have much to attend to.\"\n\n\"I will, since you wish me,\" said Emma, the tears starting in her eyes,\nas she quitted the room.\n\n\"Mr. Bates, the auctioneer, wishes to see you, sir,\" said the footman,\nas he came in.\n\n\"Request that he will walk in,\" replied Mr. Campbell.\n\nMr. Bates, the auctioneer, came in, and presented a letter to Mr.\nCampbell, who requested him to take a chair while he read it. It was\nfrom Mr. Douglas Campbell, the new proprietor of the estate, requesting\nMr. Bates would ascertain if Mr. Campbell was willing that the\nfurniture, etc., should be disposed of by valuation, and if so,\nrequesting Mr. Bates to put a liberal value on it, and draw upon him for\nthe amount.\n\n\"This is very considerate of Mr. Douglas Campbell,\" observed Mrs.\nCampbell; \"of course, my dear, you can have no objection?\"\n\n\"None whatever; return my best thanks to Mr. Douglas Campbell for his\nkindness; and, Mr. Bates, if you can possibly value by to-morrow or next\nday, I should esteem it a favor.\"\n\n\"It shall be done, sir,\" replied Mr. Bates, who then rose and took his\nleave.\n\nAs soon as the valuation was finished, Mr. Campbell was enabled to make\nan estimate of what remained to them out of the property, and found that\nthe whole sum amounted to between seventeen and eighteen hundred pounds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nIt may appear strange that, after having been in possession of the\nestate for ten years, and considering that he had younger children to\nprovide for, Mr. Campbell had not laid up a larger sum; but this can be\nfully explained. As I before said, the estate was in very bad order when\nMr. Campbell came into possession, and he devoted a large portion of the\nincome to improving it; and, secondly, he had expended a considerable\nsum in building almshouses and schools, works which he would not delay,\nas he considered them as religious obligations. The consequence was,\nthat it was not until a year before the claim was made to the estate,\nthat he had commenced laying by for his younger children; and as the\nestate was then worth £2,000 per annum more than it was at the time\nthat he came into possession of it, he had resolved to put by £5,000 per\nannum, and had done so for twelve months. The enormous legal expenses\nhad, however, swallowed up this sum, and more, as we have already\nstated; and thus he was left a poorer man by some hundreds than he was\nwhen the property fell to him. The day after the valuation, the eldest\nson, Henry, made his appearance; he seemed much dejected, more so than\nhis parents, and those who knew him, would have supposed. It was,\nhowever, ascribed to his feeling for his father and mother, rather than\nfor himself.\n\nMany were the consultations held by Mr. and Mrs. Campbell as to their\nfuture plans; but nothing at all feasible, or likely to prove\nadvantageous, suggested itself to them. With only sixteen or seventeen\nhundred pounds, they scarcely knew where to go, or how to act. Return to\nhis profession Mr. Campbell knew that he could not, with any chance of\nsupporting his family. His eldest son, Henry, might obtain a situation,\nbut he was really fit for nothing but the bar or holy orders; and how\nwere they to support him till he could support himself? Alfred, who was\nnow a master's mate, could, it is true, support himself, but it would be\nwith difficulty, and there was little chance of his promotion. Then\nthere were the two other boys, and the two girls growing up fast; in\nshort, a family of eight people. To put so small a sum in the funds\nwould be useless, as they could not live upon the interest which it\nwould give, and how to employ it they knew not. They canvassed the\nmatter over and over, but without success, and each night they laid\ntheir heads upon the pillow more and more disheartened. They were all\nready to leave the Hall, but knew not where to direct their steps when\nthey left it; and thus they continued wavering for a week, until they\nwere embraced by their son Alfred, who had made all speed to join them,\nas soon as the ship had been paid off. After the first joy of meeting\nbetween those who had been separated so long was over, Mr. Campbell\nsaid, \"I'm sorry, Alfred, that I could not give your messmates any\nfishing.\"\n\n\"And so am I, and so were they, for your sakes, my dear father and\nmother; but what is, is--and what can't be helped, can't--so we must\nmake the best of it; but where's Henry and my cousins?\"\n\n\"They are walking in the park, Alfred; you had better join them; they\nare most anxious to see you.\"\n\n\"I will, mother; let us get over these huggings and kissings, and then\nwe shall be more rational: so good-by for half an hour,\" said Alfred,\nkissing his mother again, and then hastening out of the room.\n\n\"His spirits are not subdued, at all events,\" observed Mrs. Campbell. \"I\nthank God for it.\"\n\nAlfred soon fell in with his brother and his cousins, Mary and Emma, and\nafter the huggings and kissings, as he termed them, were over, he made\ninquiries into the real state of his father's affairs. After a short\nconversation, Henry, who was very much depressed in his spirits, said,\n\"Mary and Emma, perhaps you will now go in; I wish to have some\nconversation with Alfred.\"\n\n\"You are terribly out of heart, Harry,\" observed Alfred, after his\ncousins had left them. \"Are things so very bad?\"\n\n\"They are bad enough, Alfred; but what makes me so low-spirited is, that\nI fear my folly has made them worse.\"\n\n\"How so?\" replied Alfred.\n\n\"The fact is, that my father has but £1,700 left in the world, a sum\nsmall enough; but what annoys me is this. When I was at college, little\nimagining such a reverse of fortune, I anticipated my allowance, because\nI knew that I could pay at Christmas, and I ran in debt about £200; My\nfather always cautioned me not to exceed my allowance, and thinks that I\nhave not done so. Now, I can not bear the idea of leaving college in\ndebt, and, at the same time, it will be a heavy blow to my poor father,\nif he has to part with £200, out of his trifling remainder, to pay my\ndebt. This is what has made me so unhappy. I can not bear to tell him,\nbecause I feel convinced that he is so honorable, he will pay it\nimmediately. I am mad with myself, and really do not know what to do. I\ndo nothing but reproach myself all day, and I can not sleep at night. I\nhave been very foolish, but I am sure you will kindly enter into my\npresent feelings. I waited till you came home, because I thought you had\nbetter tell my father the fact, for I feel as if I should die with shame\nand vexation.\"\n\n\"Look you, Harry,\" replied Alfred, \"as for outrunning the constable, as\nwe term it at sea, it's a very common thing, and, all things considered,\nno great harm done, when you suppose that you have the means, and intend\nto pay; so don't lay that to heart. That you would give your right hand\nnot to have done so, as things have turned out, I really believe; but,\nhowever, there is no occasion to fret any more about it. I have received\nthree years' pay, and the prize-money for the last eighteen months, and\nthere is still some more due, for a French privateer. Altogether it\namounts to £250, which I had intended to have made over to my father,\nnow that he is on a lee-shore; but it will come to the same thing,\nwhether I give it to you to pay your debts, or give it to him, as he\nwill pay them, if you do not; so here it is, take what you want, and\nhand me over what's left. My father don't know that I have any money,\nand now he won't know it; at the same time he won't know that you owe\nany; so that squares the account, and he will be as well off as ever.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear Alfred; you don't know what a relief this will be to\nmy mind. Now I can look my father in his face.\"\n\n\"I hope you will; we are not troubled with such delicate feelings on\nboard ship, Harry. I should have told him the truth long before this. I\ncouldn't bear to keep any thing on my conscience. If this misfortune had\nhappened last cruise, I should have been just in your position; for I\nhad a tailor's bill to pay as long as a frigate's pennant, and not\nenough in my pocket to buy a mouse's breakfast. Now, let's go in again,\nand be as merry as possible, and cheer them up a little.\"\n\nAlfred's high spirits did certainly do much to cheer them all up; and\nafter tea, Mr. Campbell, who had previously consulted his wife, as soon\nas the servant had quitted the room, entered on a full explanation of\nthe means which were left to them; and stated, that he wished in his\ndifficulty to put the question before the whole family, and ascertain\nwhether any project might come into their heads upon which they might\ndecide and act. Henry, who had recovered his spirits since the\nassistance he had received from Alfred, was desired to speak first. He\nreplied:\n\n\"My dear father and mother, if you can not between you hit upon any\nplan, I am afraid it is not likely that I can assist you. All I have to\nsay is, that whatever may be decided upon, I shall most cheerfully do my\nduty toward you and my brothers and sisters. My education has not been\none likely to be very useful to a poor man, but I am ready to work with\nmy hands as well as with my head, to the best of my abilities.\"\n\n\"That I am sure of, my dear boy,\" replied his father. \"Now, Alfred, we\nmust look to you as our last hope, for your two cousins are not likely\nto give us much advice.\"\n\n\"Well, father, I have been thinking a good deal about it, and I have a\nproposal to make which may at first startle you, but it appears to me\nthat it is our only, and our best, resource. The few hundred pounds\nwhich you have left are of no use in this country, except to keep you\nfrom starving for a year or two; but in another country they may be made\nto be worth as many thousands. In this country, a large family becomes a\nheavy charge and expense; in another country, the more children you\nhave, the richer man you are. If, therefore, you would consent to\ntransport your family and your present means into another country,\ninstead of being a poor, you might be a rich man.\"\n\n\"What country is that, Alfred?\"\n\n\"Why, father, the purser of our ship had a brother, who, soon after the\nFrench were beaten out of the Canadas, went out there to try his\nfortune. He had only three hundred pounds in the world: he has been\nthere now about four years, and I read a letter from him which the\npurser received when the frigate arrived at Portsmouth, in which he\nstates that he is doing well, and getting rich fast; that he has a farm\nof five hundred acres, of which two hundred are cleared; and that if he\nonly had some children large enough to help him, he would soon be worth\nten times the money, as he would purchase more land immediately. Land is\nto be bought there at a dollar an acre, and you may pick and choose.\nWith your money, you might buy a large property; with your children, you\nmight improve it fast; and in a few years, you would at all events be\ncomfortable, if not flourishing, in your circumstances. Your children\nwould work for you, and you would have the satisfaction of knowing that\nyou left them independent and happy.\"\n\n\"I acknowledge, my dear boy, that you have struck upon a plan which has\nmuch to recommend it. Still there are drawbacks.\"\n\n\"Drawbacks!\" replied Alfred, \"yes, to be sure, there are; if estates\nwere to be picked up for merely going out for them, there would not be\nmany left for you to choose; but, my dear father, I know no drawbacks\nwhich can not be surmounted. Let us see what these drawbacks are. First,\nhard labor; occasional privation; a log hut, till we can get a better;\nsevere winter; isolation from the world; occasional danger, even from\nwild beasts and savages. I grant these are but sorry exchanges for such\na splendid mansion as this--fine furniture, excellent cooking, polished\nsociety, and the interest one feels for what is going on in our own\ncountry, which is daily communicated to us. Now, as to hard labor, I and\nHenry will take as much of that off your hands as we can: if the winter\nis severe, there is no want of firewood; if the cabin is rude, at least\nwe will make it comfortable; if we are shut out from the world, we shall\nhave society enough among ourselves; if we are in danger, we will have\nfirearms and stout hearts to defend ourselves; and, really, I do not see\nbut we may be very happy, very comfortable, and, at all events, very\nindependent.\"\n\n\"Alfred, you talk as if you were going with us,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"And do you think that I am not, my dear mother? Do you imagine that I\nwould remain here when you were there, and my presence would be useful?\nNo--no--I love the service, it is true, but I know my duty, which is,\nto assist my father and mother: in fact, I prefer it; a midshipman's\nideas of independence are very great; and I had rather range the wilds\nof America free and independent, than remain in the service, and have to\ntouch my hat to every junior lieutenant, perhaps for twenty years to\ncome. If you go, I go, that is certain. Why, I should be miserable if\nyou went without me; I should dream every night that an Indian had run\naway with Mary, or that a bear had eaten up my little Emma.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll take my chance of the Indian,\" replied Mary Percival.\n\n\"And I of the bear,\" said Emma. \"Perhaps he'll only hug me as tight as\nAlfred did when he came home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss, for the comparison,\" replied Alfred, laughing.\n\n\"I certainly consider that your proposal, Alfred, merits due\nreflection,\" observed Mrs. Campbell. \"Your father and I will consult,\nand perhaps by to-morrow morning we may have come to a decision. Now we\nhad better all go to bed.\"\n\n\"I shall dream of the Indian, I am sure,\" said Mary.\n\n\"And I shall dream of the bear,\" added Emma, looking archly at Alfred.\n\n\"And I shall dream of a very pretty girl--that I saw at Portsmouth,\"\nsaid Alfred.\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" replied Emma.\n\nShortly afterward Mr. Campbell rang the bell for the servants; family\nprayers were read, and all retired in good spirits.\n\nThe next morning they all met at an early hour; and after Mr. Campbell\nhad, as was his invariable rule, read a portion of the Bible, and a\nprayer of thankfulness, they sat down to breakfast. After breakfast was\nover, Mr. Campbell said--\n\n\"My dear children, last night, after you had left us, your mother and I\nhad a long consultation, and we have decided that we have no alternative\nleft us but to follow the advice which Alfred has given: if, then, you\nare all of the same opinion as we are, we have resolved that we will try\nour fortunes in the Canadas.\"\n\n\"I am certainly of that opinion,\" replied Henry.\n\n\"And you, my girls?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"We will follow you to the end of the world, uncle,\" replied Mary, \"and\ntry if we can by any means in our power repay your kindness to two poor\norphans.\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell embraced their nieces, for they were much affected\nby Mary's reply.\n\nAfter a pause, Mrs. Campbell said--\n\n\"And now that we have come to a decision, we must commence our\narrangements immediately. How shall we dispose of ourselves? Come,\nAlfred and Henry, what do you propose doing?\"\n\n\"I must return immediately to Oxford, to settle my affairs, and dispose\nof my books and other property.\"\n\n\"Shall you have sufficient money, my dear boy, to pay every thing?\" said\nMr. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, my dear father,\" replied Henry, coloring up a little.\n\n\"And I,\" said Alfred, \"presume that I can be of no use here; therefore I\npropose that I should start for Liverpool this afternoon by the coach,\nfor it is from Liverpool that we had better embark. I shall first write\nto our purser for what information he can procure, and obtain all I can\nat Liverpool from other people. As soon as I have any thing to\ncommunicate, I will write.\"\n\n\"Write as soon as you arrive, Alfred, whether you have any thing to\ncommunicate or not; at all events, we shall know of your safe arrival.\"\n\n\"I will, my dear mother.\"\n\n\"Have you money, Alfred?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite sufficient, father. I don't travel with four horses.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we will remain here to pack up, Alfred; and you must look\nout for some moderate lodging for us to go into as soon as we arrive at\nLiverpool. At what time do the ships sail for Quebec?\"\n\n\"Just about this time, father. This is March, and they will now sail\nevery week almost. The sooner we are off the better, that we may be\ncomfortably housed in before the winter.\"\n\nA few hours after this conversation, Henry and Alfred left the Hall\nupon their several destinations. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and the two girls\nhad plenty of employment for three or four days in packing up. It was\nsoon spread through the neighborhood that they were going to emigrate to\nCanada; and the tenants who had held their farms under Mr. Campbell, all\ncame forward and proffered their wagons and horses to transport the\neffects to Liverpool, without his being put to any expense.\n\nIn the meantime a letter had been received from Alfred, who had not been\nidle. He had made acquaintance with some merchants who traded to Canada,\nand by them had been introduced to two or three persons who had settled\nthere a few years before, and who were able to give him every\ninformation. They informed him what was most advisable to take out; how\nthey were to proceed upon their landing; and, what was of more\nimportance, the merchants gave him letters of introduction to English\nmerchants at Quebec, who would afford them every assistance in the\nselecting and purchasing of land, and in their transport up the country.\nAlfred had also examined a fine timber-ship, which was to sail in three\nweeks; and had bargained for the price of their passage, in case they\ncould get ready in time to go by her. He wrote all these particulars to\nhis father, waiting for his reply to act upon his wishes.\n\nHenry returned from Oxford, having settled his accounts, and with the\nproduce of the sale of his classics and other books in his pocket. He\nwas full of spirits, and of the greatest assistance to his father and\nmother.\n\nAlfred had shown so much judgment in all he had undertaken, that his\nfather wrote to him stating that they would be ready for the ship which\nhe named, and that he might engage the cabins, and also at once procure\nthe various articles which they were advised to take out with them, and\ndraw upon him for the amount, if the people would not wait for the\nmoney. In a fortnight they were all ready; the wagons had left with\ntheir effects some days before. Mr. Campbell wrote a letter to Mr.\nDouglas Campbell, thanking him for his kindness and consideration to\nthem, and informing him that they would leave Wexton Hall on the\nfollowing day. He only begged, as a favor, that the schoolmaster and\nschoolmistress of the village school should be continued on, as it was\nof great importance that the instruction of the poor should not be\nneglected; and added, that perceiving by the newspapers that Mr. Douglas\nCampbell had lately married, Mrs. Campbell and he wished him and his\nwife every happiness, etc., etc.\n\nHaving dispatched this letter, there was nothing more to be done,\nprevious to their departure from the Hall, except to pay and dismiss the\nfew servants who were with them; for Mrs. Campbell had resolved upon\ntaking none out with her. That afternoon they walked round the\nplantation and park for the last time. Mrs. Campbell and the girls went\nround the rooms of the Hall to ascertain that every thing was left tidy,\nneat, and clean. The poor girls sighed as they passed by the harp and\npiano in the drawing-room, for they were old friends.\n\n\"Never mind, Mary,\" said Emma; \"we have our guitars, and may have music\nin the woods of Canada without harp or piano.\"\n\nThe following morning, the coach, of which they had secured the whole of\nthe inside, drove up to the Hall door, and they all got in, the tenants\nand poor people standing round them, all with their hats in their hands\nout of respect, and wishing them every success as they drove away\nthrough the avenue to the park gates. The Hall and the park itself had\nbeen long out of sight before a word was exchanged. They checked their\ntears, but their hearts were too full for them to venture to speak.\n\nThe day afterward they arrived at Liverpool, where Alfred had provided\nlodgings. Every thing had been sent on board, and the ship had hauled\nout in the stream. As they had nothing to detain them on the shore, and\nthe captain wished to take advantage of the first fair wind, they all\nembarked four days after their arrival at Liverpool; and I shall now\nleave them on board of the London Merchant, which was the name of the\nvessel, making all their little arrangements previous to their sailing,\nunder the superintendence of Alfred, while I give some little more\ninsight into the characters, ages, and dispositions of the family.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nMr. Campbell was a person of many amiable qualities. He was a religious,\ngood man, very fond of his wife, to whose opinions he yielded in\npreference to his own, and very partial to his children, to whom he was\ninclined to be over indulgent. He was not a person of much energy of\ncharacter, but he was sensible and well-informed. His goodness of heart\nrendered him liable to be imposed upon, for he never suspected any\ndeceit, notwithstanding that he was continually deceived. His character\nwas therefore that of a simple, good, honest man.\n\nMrs. Campbell was well matched with him as a wife, as she had all that\nenergy and decision of character which was sometimes wanting in her\nhusband. Still there was nothing masculine in her manners and\nappearance; on the contrary, she was delicate in her form, and very soft\nin her manners. She had great firmness and self-possession, and had\nbrought up all her children admirably. Obedience to their parents was\nthe principle instilled into them after their duty to God; for she knew\ntoo well that a disobedient child can never prosper. If ever there was a\nwoman fitted to meet the difficulty and danger which threatened them, it\nwas Mrs. Campbell, for she had courage and presence of mind, joined to\nactivity and cleverness.\n\nHenry, the eldest son, was now nearly twenty years of age. He possessed\nmuch of the character of his father, was without vice, but rather\ninclined to inaction than otherwise. Much was to be ascribed to his\neducation and college life, and more to his natural disposition.\n\nAlfred, the sailor, was, on the contrary, full of energy and active in\nevery thing, patient and laborious, if required, and never taking any\nthing in hand without finishing it, if possible. He was rough, but not\nrude, both in his speech and his manners, very kind-hearted, at the same\ntime very confident in himself and afraid of nothing.\n\nMary Percival was a very amiable, reflective girl, quiet without being\nsad, not often indulging in conversation, except when alone with her\nsister Emma. She was devotedly attached to her uncle and aunt, and was\ncapable of more than she had any idea of herself, for she was of a\nmodest disposition, and thought humbly of herself. Her disposition was\nsweet, and was portrayed in her countenance. She was now seventeen years\nold, and very much admired.\n\nHer sister Emma, who was but fifteen, was of a very different\ndisposition, naturally gay, and inclined to find amusement in every\nthing--cheerful as the lark, and singing from morning to night. Her\ndisposition, owing to Mrs. Campbell's care and attention, was equally\namiable as her sister's, and her high spirits seldom betrayed her into\nindiscretion. She was the life of the family when Alfred was away: he\nonly was her equal in high spirits.\n\nPercival, the third boy, was now twelve years old; he was a quiet,\nclever lad, very obedient and very attentive to what was told him, very\nfond of obtaining information, being naturally very inquisitive.\n\nJohn, the fourth boy, was ten years old--a sturdy, John Bull sort of a\nboy, not very fond of learning, but a well-disposed boy in most things.\nHe preferred any thing to his book; at the same time, he was obedient,\nand tried to keep up his attention as well as he could, which was all\nthat could be expected from a boy of his age. He was very slow in every\nthing, very quiet, and seldom spoke unless first spoken to. He was not\nsilly, although many people would have thought him so, but he certainly\nwas a very strange boy, and it was difficult to say what he would turn\nout.\n\nI have now described the family as they appeared at the time that they\nembarked on board of the London Merchant; and have only to add, that on\nthe third day after their embarkation, they made sail with a fair wind,\nand ran down the Irish Channel.\n\nThe London Merchant sailed for Cork, where the North American convoy\nwere to assemble. At the time we speak of, the war had recommenced\nbetween this country and the French, who were suffering all the horrors\nof the Revolution. On their arrival at Cork, our party recovered a\nlittle from the sea-sickness to which all are subject on their first\nembarkation. They found themselves at anchor with more than a hundred\nmerchant vessels, among which were to be perceived the lofty masts and\nspars of a large fifty-gun ship, and two small frigates, which were\nappointed to convoy them to their destination.\n\nThe rest of the party, still suffering, soon went down below again, but\nAlfred remained on deck leaning against the bulwarks of the vessel, his\neyes and his thoughts intently fixed upon the streaming pennants of the\nmen-of-war, and a tear rolled down his cheek, as he was reminded that he\nno longer could follow up his favorite profession. The sacrifice he had\nmade to his family was indeed great. He had talked lightly of it before\nthem, not wishing them to believe it was so. He had not told his father\nthat he had passed his examination for lieutenant before he had been\npaid off at Portsmouth; and that his captain, who was very partial to\nhim, had promised that he should soon be advanced in the service. He had\nnot told them that all his wishes, all his daily hopes, the most anxious\ndesire of his existence, which was to become a post-captain, and in\ncommand of a fine frigate, were blighted by this sacrifice he had made\nfor them and their comfort. He had concealed all this, and assumed a\nmirth which he did not feel; but now that he was alone, and the pennant\nwas once more presented to his view, his regrets could not be\ncontrolled. He sighed deeply, and turning away with his arms folded,\nsaid to himself--\"I have done my duty. It is hard, after having served\nso long, and now just arrived at the time in which I have reason to\nexpect my reward--to rise in the service--distinguish myself by my zeal,\nand obtain a reputation, which, if it pleased God, I would have\ndone--very hard, to have to leave it now, and to be hid in the woods,\nwith an ax in my hand; but how could I leave my father, my mother, and\nmy brothers and sisters, to encounter so much difficulty and privation\nby themselves, when I have a strong arm to help them! No! no!--I have\ndone my duty to those who ever did their duty to me, and I trust that my\nown conscience will prove my reward, and check that repining which we\nare too apt to feel when it pleases Heaven to blight what appears to be\nour fairest prospects ... I say, my good fellow,\" said Alfred, after a\nwhile, to a man in a boat, \"what is the name of that fifty-gun ship?\"\n\n\"I don't know which ship has fifty guns, or which has a hundred,\"\nreplied the Irishman; \"but if you mean the biggest of the three, she is\ncalled the Portsmouth.\"\n\n\"The Portsmouth! the very ship Captain Lumley was appointed to,\" cried\nAlfred. \"I must go on board.\"\n\nAlfred ran down to the cabin, and requested the captain of the\ntransport, whose name was Wilson, to allow him the small boat to go on\nboard the man-of-war. His request was granted, and Alfred was soon up\nthe side of the Portsmouth. There were some of his old messmates on the\nquarter-deck, who welcomed him heartily, for he was a great favorite.\nShortly afterward, he sent down a message by the steward, requesting\nthat Captain Lumley would see him, and was immediately afterward ordered\nto go into the cabin.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Campbell,\" said Captain Lumley, \"so you have joined us at\nlast; better late than never. You're but just in time. I thought you\nwould soon get over that foolish whim of yours, which you mentioned in\nyour letter to me, of leaving the service, just after you had passed,\nand had such good chance of promotion. What could have put it in your\nhead?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" replied Alfred, \"but my duty to my parents. It is a most\npainful step for me to take, but I leave you to judge whether I can do\notherwise.\"\n\nAlfred then detailed to Captain Lumley all that had occurred, the\nresolution which his father and mother had taken, and their being then\non board the timber-ship, and about to proceed to their new destination.\n\nCaptain Lumley heard Alfred's story without interruption, and then,\nafter a pause, said, \"I think you are right, my boy, and it does you\nhonor. Where you are going to, I have no doubt but your courage and your\nprotection will be most important. Yet it is a pity you should be lost\nto the service.\"\n\n\"I feel most sincerely, sir, I assure you, but----\"\n\n\"But you sacrifice yourself; I know that. I admire the resolution of\nyour father and mother. Few could have the courage to have taken such a\nstep--few women, especially, I shall call upon them, and pay my\nrespects. In half an hour I shall be ready, and you shall accompany me,\nand introduce me. In the meantime you can go and see your old\nmessmates.\"\n\nAlfred left the cabin, much flattered by the kindness of Captain Lumley,\nand went down to his former messmates, with whom he remained until the\nboatswain piped away the crew of the captain's barge. He then went on\ndeck, and as soon as the captain came up, he went into the boat. The\ncaptain followed, and they were soon on board of the London Merchant.\nAlfred introduced Captain Lumley to his father and mother; and in the\ncourse of half an hour, being mutually pleased with each other, an\nintimacy was formed, when Captain Lumley observed, \"I presume that, much\nas you may require your son's assistance on your arrival at Canada, you\ncan dispense with his presence on board of this vessel. My reason for\nmaking this observation is that no chance should ever be thrown away.\nOne of my lieutenants wishes to leave the ship on family concerns. He\nhas applied to me, and I have considered it my duty to refuse him, now\nthat we are on the point of sailing, and I am unable to procure another.\nBut for your son's sake, I will now permit him to go, and will, if you\nwill allow him to come on board of the Portsmouth, give Alfred an acting\nlieutenant's order. Should any thing occur on the passage out, and it is\nnot at all impossible, it will insure his promotion; even if nothing\noccurs, I will have his acting order confirmed. At Quebec, he shall, of\ncourse, leave the ship, and go with you. I don't pretend to detain him\nfrom his duty; but you will observe, that if he does obtain his rank, he\nwill also obtain his half-pay, which, if he remains in Canada with you,\nwill be a great assistance; and if things should turn out so well, that\nyou can, after a year or two, do without him, and allow him to return to\nthe service, he will then have already gained the most important step,\nand will, I have no doubt, soon rise to the command of a ship. I will\ngive you till to-morrow to decide. Alfred can come on board in the\nmorning, and let me know.\"\n\n\"I think I may say, Captain Lumley,\" replied Mrs. Campbell, \"that my\nhusband could have but one reason in hesitating a moment, and that is,\nto ascertain whether I should like to part with my son during our\npassage out. I should, indeed, be a very weak woman, if I did not make\nsuch a trifling sacrifice for his benefit, and, at the time, feel most\ngrateful to you for your kind intentions toward him. I rather think that\nMr. Campbell will not find it necessary to have till to-morrow morning\nto consider the proposal; but I leave him to answer for himself.\"\n\n\"I can assure you, Captain Lumley, that Mrs. Campbell has only expressed\nmy own feelings, and, as far as we are concerned, your offer is most\ngratefully accepted.\"\n\n\"Then, Alfred,\" replied Captain Lumley, \"has only to make his appearance\non board of the Portsmouth to-morrow morning, and he will find his\nacting order ready for him. We sail, I believe, the day after, if the\nweather is at all favorable; so, if I have not another opportunity to\npay my respects to you, you must allow me to say farewell now. I shall\nkeep my eye upon your vessel during the passage; at all events, Alfred\nwill, I'm very sure.\"\n\nCaptain Lumley shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, bowed to the rest\nof the cabin party, and quitted the ship. As he went over the side, he\nobserved to Alfred, \"I perceive you have some attractions in your party.\nIt is quite melancholy to think that those pretty cousins of yours\nshould be buried in the woods of Canada. To-morrow, at nine o'clock,\nthen, I shall expect you.--Adieu!\"\n\nAlthough the idea of Alfred leaving them during the passage out was not\npleasant, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were most happy at the chance which had\noffered itself for their son's advantage, and seemed in good spirits\nwhen he took leave of them on the following morning.\n\n\"Captain Wilson, you sail so well, that I hope you will keep close to us\nall the passage out,\" observed Alfred, as he was taking leave.\n\n\"Except you happen to come to action with an enemy, and then I shall\nhaul off to a respectful distance, Mr. Alfred,\" replied Captain Wilson\nlaughing.\n\n\"That, of course. Cannon-balls were never invented for ladies, although\nthey have no objection to balls,--have they Emma? Well, good-by once\nmore. You can often see me with the spy-glass if you feel inclined.\nRecollect that.\"\n\nAlfred shoved off in the boat, and was soon on board of the Portsmouth.\nThe following day they sailed with a fair wind and moderate weather; the\nconvoy now increased to 120 vessels.\n\nWe must leave Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and family on board the London\nMerchant, and follow Alfred in the Portsmouth, during the passage to\nQuebec.\n\nFor several days the weather was moderate, although the wind was not\nalways fair, and the convoy was kept together, and in good order. The\nLondon Merchant was never far away from the Portsmouth, and Alfred\nemployed a large portion of his time, when he was not keeping his watch,\nin keeping his spy-glass upon the vessel, and watching the motions of\nhis cousins and the rest of the family. On board of the London Merchant\nthey were similarly occupied, and very often a handkerchief was waved by\nway of salute and recognition. At last they arrived off the banks of\nNewfoundland, and were shrouded in a heavy fog, the men-of-war\nconstantly firing guns, to inform the merchant-ships in what direction\nthey were to steer, and the merchant-vessels of the convoy ringing their\nbells, to warn each other, that they might not be run foul of.\n\nThe fog lasted two days, and was still continuing when the party on\nboard the London Merchant, just as they were sitting down to dinner in\nthe cabin, heard a noise and bustle on deck. Captain Wilson ran hastily\nup and found that his vessel had been boarded by a French boat's crew,\nwho had beaten down the men and taken possession. As there was no help,\nall he could do was to go down to the cabin, and inform his passengers\nthat they were prisoners. The shock of this intelligence was very great,\nas may be supposed, but still there was no useless lamentation or\nweeping. One thing is certain, that this news quite spoiled their\nappetite for their dinner, which, however, was soon dispatched by the\nFrench officer and his men, after the boat had left, and the vessel's\nhead had been put in an opposite direction.\n\nCaptain Wilson, who had returned on deck, came down in about a quarter\nof an hour, and informed the party, who were silently brooding over this\nsudden change in their prospects, that the wind was very light, and that\nhe thought the fog was clearing off a little, and that if it did so\nbefore it was dark, he was in great hopes that they should be\nrecaptured. This intelligence appeared to revive the hopes of Mr. and\nMrs. Campbell, and they were still more encouraged when they heard the\nsounds of guns at no very great distance. In a few minutes afterward the\ncannonading became very furious, and the Frenchmen who were on board\nbegan to show strong signs of uneasiness.\n\nThe fact was, that a French squadron, of one sixty-gun ship and two\ncorvettes, had been on the look-out for the convoy, and had come in\namong them during the fog. They had captured and taken possession of\nseveral vessels before they were discovered, but the sixty-gun ship at\nlast ran very near to the Portsmouth, and Alfred, who had the watch, and\nwas on a sharp look-out, soon perceived through the looming fog, that\nshe was not one of the convoy. He ran down to acquaint the captain, and\nthe men were immediately ordered to their quarters, without beating the\ndrum, or making any noise that might let the enemy know they were so\nnear. The yards were then braced in, to check the way of the Portsmouth,\nso that the strange vessel might come up with her. Silence was kept fore\nand aft, not a whisper was to be heard; and as the Frenchmen neared\nthem, they perceived a boat putting off from her to board another vessel\nclose to them, and also heard the orders given to the men in the French\nlanguage. This was sufficient for Captain Lumley: he put the helm down,\nand poured a raking broadside into the enemy, who was by no means\nprepared for such a sudden salute, although her guns were cast loose,\nready for action, in case of accident. The answer to the broadside was a\ncry of \"_Vive la Republique!_\" and, in a few seconds, both ships were\nhotly engaged--the Portsmouth having the advantage of lying upon the bow\nof her antagonist.\n\nAs is often the case, the heavy cannonading brought on a dead calm, and\nthe two ships remained in their respective positions, except that the\nPortsmouth's was more favorable, having drawn ahead of the French\nvessel, so that her broadside was poured into her opponent, without her\nbeing able to return the fire from more than four or five of her guns.\nThe fog became more opaque than ever; the two ships had neared each\nother considerably, or it would have been impossible to distinguish. All\nthat they could see from the deck of the Portsmouth was the jib-boom and\ncap of the bowsprit of the Frenchman, the rest of her bowsprit, and her\nwhole hull, were lost in the impenetrable gloom; but that was sufficient\nfor the men to direct their guns, and the fire from the Portsmouth was\nmost rapid, although the extent of its execution was unknown. After half\nan hour of incessant broadsides, the two vessels had approached each\nother so close, that the jib-boom of the Frenchman was pointed between\nthe fore and main rigging of the Portsmouth. Captain Lumley immediately\ngave orders to lash the Frenchman's bowsprit to his mainmast, and this\nwas accomplished by the first lieutenant, Alfred, and the seamen,\nwithout any serious loss, for the fog was still so thick, that the\nFrenchman on their forecastle could not perceive what was doing at their\nbowsprit's cap.\n\n\"She is ours now,\" said Captain Lumley to the first lieutenant.\n\n\"Yes, sir,--fast enough. I think, if the fog were to clear away, they\nwould haul down their colors.\"\n\n\"Not till the last, depend upon it,\" replied Captain Lumley. \"Fire away\nthere, on the main-deck, give them no time to take breath. Mr. Campbell,\ntell the second lieutenant to let the foremost lower deck guns be\npointed more aft. I say, not till the last,\" repeated Captain Lumley to\nthe first lieutenant; \"these republicans will take a good deal of\nbeating, even upon the water.\"\n\n\"It's clearing up, sir, to the northward a little,\" said the master.\n\n\"I see--yes, it is,\" replied Captain Lumley. \"Well, the sooner the\nbetter: we shall see what has become of all the shot we have been\nthrowing away.\"\n\nA white silvery line appeared on the horizon, to the northward;\ngradually it increased, and as it rose up, became broader, till at last\nthe curtain was lifted up, and a few feet were to be seen above the\nclear blue water. As it continued to approach, the light became more\nvivid, the space below increased, and the water was ruffled with the\ncoming wind, till at last the fog rolled off as if it had been gradually\nfurled, and sweeping away in a heavy bank to leeward, exposed the state\nand position of the whole convoy, and the contending vessels. The\nEnglish seamen on board of the Portsmouth cheered the return of\ndaylight, as it might truly be termed. Captain Lumley found that they\nhad been contending in the very center of the convoy, which was still\nlying around them, with the exception of about fifteen vessels, which\nwere a few miles apart, with their heads in an opposite direction. These\nwere evidently those which had been captured. The two frigates, which\nhad been stationed in the rear of the convoy, were still two or three\nmiles distant, but making all sail to come up and assist the Portsmouth.\nMany of the convoy, which had been in the direction of the fire,\nappeared to have suffered in their masts and sails; but whether any\ninjury had been received in their hulls it was not possible to say. The\nFrench line-of-battle ship had suffered dreadfully from the fire of the\nPortsmouth. Her mainmast and mizzen-mast were over the side, her forward\nports were many of them almost beat into one, and every thing on board\nappeared to be in the greatest confusion.\n\n\"She can't stand this long,\" observed Captain Lumley. \"Fire away, my\nlads.\"\n\n\"The Circe and Vixen are coming down to us, sir,\" observed the first\nlieutenant; \"we do not want them, and they will only be an excuse for\nthe Frenchman to surrender to a superior force. If they recaptured the\nvessels taken, they would be of some service.\"\n\n\"Very true. Mr. Campbell, make their signal to pursue captured\nvessels.\"\n\nAlfred ran aft to obey the orders. The flags had just flown out at the\nmast-head, when he received a bullet through his arm: for the French,\nunable to use the major portion of their guns, had, when the fog cleared\nup, poured in incessant volleys of musketry upon the decks of the\nPortsmouth. Alfred desired the quarter-master to untie his neck\nhandkerchief for him, and bind up his arm. Having so done, he continued\nto do his duty. A bold attempt was now made by the French to clear their\nvessel by cutting the fastening of her bowsprit, but the marines of the\nPortsmouth were prepared for them, and after about twenty gallant\nfellows had dropped down on the booms and gangways of the Portsmouth,\nthe attempt was given up, and four minutes afterward the French colors\nwere hauled down. She was boarded from her bowsprit by the first\nlieutenant and a party of seamen. The lashings were cast off, and the\nvessels cleared of each other, and then the English seamen gave three\ncheers in honor of the victory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe French sixty-gun ship proved to be the Leonidas; she had been sent\nout with two large frigates on purpose to intercept the convoy, but she\nhad parted with her consorts in a gale of wind. Her loss of men was very\ngreat; that on board of the Portsmouth was trifling. In a couple of\nhours the Portsmouth and her prize in tow were ready to proceed with the\nconvoy, but they still remained hove to, to wait for the frigates which\nwere in chase of the captured vessels. All of these were speedily come\nup with except the London Merchant, which sailed so remarkably well. At\nlast, to the great joy of Alfred (who as soon as the bullet had been\nextracted and his arm dressed, had held his telescope fixed upon the\nchase), she hove to, and was taken possession of. Before night, the\nconvoy were again collected together, and were steering for their\ndestination. The next morning was clear, and the breeze moderate. Mrs.\nCampbell, who, as well as all the rest, was very anxious about Alfred,\nrequested Captain Wilson to run down to the Portsmouth, that they might\nascertain if he was safe. Captain Wilson did as she requested, and\nwriting in chalk \"all well\" in large letters upon the log-board, held it\nover the side as he passed close to the Portsmouth. Alfred was not on\ndeck--fever had compelled him to remain in his hammock--but Captain\nLumley made the same reply on the log-board of the Portsmouth, and Mr.\nand Mrs. Campbell were satisfied.\n\n\"How I should like to see him,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" observed Captain Wilson, \"but they have too much to do on\nboard of the Portsmouth just now; they have to repair damages and to\nlook after the wounded; they have a great quantity of prisoners on\nboard, as you may see, for a great many are now on the booms; they have\nno time for compliments.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"we must wait till we arrive\nat Quebec.\"\n\n\"But we did not see Alfred,\" said Emma.\n\n\"No, miss, because he was busy enough below, and I dare say no one told\nhim. They have said that all's well, and that is sufficient; and now we\nmust haul off again, for with such a heavy ship in tow, Captain Lumley\nwill not thank me if I am always coming so close to him.\"\n\n\"I am satisfied, Captain Wilson; pray do nothing that might displease\nCaptain Lumley. We shall soon see Alfred, I dare say, with the\nspy-glass.\"\n\n\"I see him now,\" said Mary Percival, \"he has his telescope, and he is\nwaving his hat to me.\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"now I am satisfied.\"\n\nThe Portsmouth cast off the French line-of-battle ship, as soon as they\nhad jury-masts up and could make sail on them, and the convoy proceeded\nto the mouth of the St. Lawrence.\n\n\"Captain Wilson,\" said Percival, whose eyes were fixed on the water,\n\"what animals are those, tumbling about and blowing,--those great white\nthings?\"\n\n\"They are what are called the white whale, Percival,\" replied Captain\nWilson; \"they are not often seen, except about here.\"\n\n\"Then what is the color of the other whales?\"\n\n\"The northern whales are black--they are called the black whales; but\nthe southern, or spermaceti whales, are not so dark in color.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson then, at Percival's request, gave him an account of how\nthe whales were caught, for he had been several voyages himself in the\nnorthern whale fishery.\n\nPercival was never tired of asking questions, and Captain Wilson was\nvery kind to him, and always answered him. John, generally speaking,\nstood by when Captain Wilson was talking, looking very solemn and very\nattentive, but not saying a word.\n\n\"Well John,\" said Emma to him after the conversation had been ended,\n\"what was Captain Wilson telling you about?\"\n\n\"Whales,\" replied John, walking past her.\n\n\"Well, but is that all you can tell me, John?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied John, walking away.\n\n\"At all events, Miss Emma, he keeps all his knowledge to himself,\"\nobserved Captain Wilson, laughing.\n\n\"Yes; I shall know nothing about the whale-fishery, unless you will\ncondescend to tell me yourself, that is evident,\" replied Emma, taking\nthe offered arm of Captain Wilson, who, at her request, immediately\nresumed the subject.\n\nIn three weeks from the day of the action they had anchored off the town\nof Quebec.\n\nAs soon as they had anchored, Alfred obtained leave to go on board of\nthe London Merchant, and then, for the first time, his family knew that\nhe had been wounded. His arm was still in a sling, but was healing fast.\n\nI shall pass over the numerous inquiries on his part, relative to their\ncapture and recapture, and on theirs, as to the action with the French\nship.\n\nWhile they were in conversation, Captain Lumley was reported to be\ncoming on board in his boat. They went on the deck of the vessel to\nreceive him.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Campbell,\" said Captain Lumley after the first salutations\nwere over, \"you must congratulate me on my having captured a vessel\nsomewhat larger than my own; and I must congratulate you on the conduct\nand certain promotion of your son Alfred. He has richly deserved it.\"\n\n\"I am very thankful, Captain Lumley, and do most heartily congratulate\nyou,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"I only regret that my boy has been\nwounded.\"\n\n\"The very thing that you should, on the contrary, be thankful for, Mrs.\nCampbell,\" replied Captain Lumley. \"It is the most fortunate wound in\nthe world, as it not only adds to his claims, but enables me to let him\njoin you and go to Canada with you, without it being supposed that he\nhas quitted the service.\"\n\n\"How so, Captain Lumley?\"\n\n\"I can discharge him to sick-quarters here at Quebec. If they think any\nthing about it at all at home, it will be that his wound is much more\nsevere than it really is; and he can remain on half-pay as long as he\npleases. There are plenty ready to be employed. But I can not wait any\nlonger. I am going on shore to call upon the Governor, and I thought I\nwould just see you on my way. You may assure yourselves that if I can be\nof any use to you, I will not fail to exert any little influence I may\nhave.\"\n\nCaptain Lumley then took a cordial leave of the whole party, telling\nAlfred that he might consider himself as discharged from the ship, and\nmight rejoin his family.\n\n\"Heaven sends us friends when we most need them and least expect them,\"\nsaid Mrs. Campbell, as she watched the boat pulling away. \"Who would\nhave imagined, when we anchored at Cork, that such good fortune should\nhave awaited us; and that, at the very time Alfred had given up his\nprofession for our sake, his promotion in the service was awaiting him?\"\n\nShortly afterward Mrs. Campbell and Henry went on shore with Captain\nWilson to look out for lodgings, and present the letters of introduction\nwhich he had received for some Quebec merchants. As they were looking\nfor lodgings in company with a Mr. Farquhar, who had kindly volunteered\nto assist them, they met Captain Lumley on his return from the\nGovernor.\n\n\"I am glad to have met you, Mrs. Campbell,\" said Captain Lumley; \"I\nfound on paying my respects to the Governor, that there is what they\ncall the Admiralty House here, which is kept furnished by Government for\nthe senior officers of his Majesty's ships. It is at my disposal; and as\nthe Governor has requested me to take up my abode at Government House, I\nbeg you will consider it at your service. You will find better\naccommodation there than in lodgings, and it will save you considerable\nexpense.\"\n\n\"We need look no further, Mrs. Campbell,\" said Mr. Farquhar.\n\nMrs. Campbell expressed her acknowledgments to Captain Lumley, and\nreturned on board with this pleasing intelligence.\n\n\"Oh, Alfred, how much we are indebted to you, my dear boy,\" said Mrs.\nCampbell.\n\n\"To me, mother?--to Captain Lumley, I should rather think.\"\n\n\"Yes, to Captain Lumley, I grant; but still it has been your good\nconduct when under his command which has made him attached to you; and\nit is to that we owe his acquaintance, and all the kindness we have\nreceived from him.\"\n\nThe next day the family disembarked and took possession of the Admiralty\nHouse. Mr. Farquhar procured them a female servant, who, with a man and\nhis wife left in charge of the house, supplied all the attendance they\nrequired. Mrs. Campbell settled with Captain Wilson, who very generously\nrefused to take any money for Alfred's passage, as he had not remained\non board of the London Merchant: promising, however, to accept their\ninvitation to come to them whenever he could find leisure, he took leave\nof them for the present, and they were left alone in their new\nresidence.\n\nIn a few days the Campbells found themselves comfortably settled in the\nAdmiralty House, but they had no intention of remaining there longer\nthan was necessary; as, notwithstanding the accommodation, their\nresidence at Quebec was attended with expense, and Mr. Campbell was\naware that he had no money to throw away.\n\nOn the fourth day after their landing Captain Lumley called to take\nleave; but the day previous he had introduced them to the Governor, who\nreturned Mr. Campbell's call, and appeared to be much interested in\ntheir welfare, owing of course to the representations of Captain Lumley.\nIt was not, therefore, surprising that they should part with regret from\none who had proved himself such a kind friend; and many were the\nexpressions of gratitude which were made by the whole party. Captain\nLumley shook hands with them all; and, assuring Alfred that he would not\nlose sight of his interests, wished them every success, and left the\nhouse. An hour afterward the Portsmouth was under weigh, and running out\nwith a fine breeze.\n\nOn the following day the Governor requested Mr. Campbell would call upon\nhim; and when they met, he pointed out to him that he would have great\ndifficulties, and, he was fearful, great hardships, to encounter in\nfollowing up his plan of settling in Upper Canada. He did not dissuade\nhim from so doing, as he had nothing more promising to offer which might\ninduce him to change his mind, but he thought it right to forewarn him\nof trials, that he might be well prepared.\n\n\"I feel, of course, a strong interest in any English family so well\nbrought up, and accustomed, as I find yours has been, to luxury, being\nplaced in such a situation; and the interest which my old friend,\nCaptain Lumley, takes in you, is quite sufficient to induce me to offer\nyou every assistance in my power: that you may depend upon, Mr.\nCampbell. The Surveyor-General is coming here immediately, I must first\nintroduce you to him, as it is from him that the land must be obtained,\nand of course he can advise you well on the point of locality; but you\nmust recollect that it is not much more than thirty years since these\nprovinces have been surrendered to Great Britain, and that not only the\nFrench population, but the Indians, are very hostile to the English, for\nthe Indians were, and still are, firm allies to the French, and detest\nus. I have been reflecting upon the affair, and I hope to be of some\nservice to you: if I am not, it will not, I assure you, be from any want\nof will; under every advantage which may be procured for you, at all\nevents, you will require stout hearts and able hands. Your son Alfred\nwill be of great service, but we must try and procure you some other\nassistance that can be trusted.\"\n\nA long conversation then took place between the Governor and Mr.\nCampbell, during which the latter received much valuable information: it\nwas interrupted, however, by the arrival of the Surveyor-General, and\nthe topic was resumed.\n\n\"The land that I would propose to Mr. Campbell,\" observed the\nSurveyor-General, after a time, \"if there is no objection to part with\nit, is a portion of what has been laid aside as Government reserve on\nthis part of the Lake Ontario; there are lands to be obtained nearer to\nMontreal, but all the land of good quality has been purchased. This\nland, you will observe, Mr. Campbell, is peculiarly good, having some\nfew acres of what we call prairie, or natural meadow. It has also the\nadvantage of running with a large frontage on the beach, and there is a\nsmall river on one side of it; besides, it is not a great distance,\nperhaps four or five miles, from Fort Frontignac, and it might be easy\nto obtain assistance if required.\"\n\nThe Surveyor-General pointed to a part of the map, near to Presqu' Ile\nde Quinte, as he made this observation to the Governor.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" replied the Governor, \"and I observe that there is\nalready a settler on the other side of the stream.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the Surveyor; \"that allotment was granted before it\nwas decided that the rest should be a Government reserve; and if proof\nwere required of the goodness of the land, it would be found in the\nperson who took it. It was taken four years ago by the old hunter,\nMalachi Bone; he has been over every part of it, of course, and knows\nwhat it is. You recollect the man, don't you, sir? He was a guide to the\nEnglish army before the surrender of Quebec; General Wolfe had a high\nopinion of him, and his services were so good that he was allowed that\ntract of 150 acres.\"\n\n\"I now remember him,\" replied the Governor, \"but as I have not seen him\nfor so many years, he had escaped my recollection.\"\n\n\"It will be a great advantage to you, Mr. Campbell, having this man as a\nneighbor.\"\n\n\"Now,\" continued the Governor, addressing the Surveyor-General, \"do you\nknow of any person who would be willing to serve Mr. Campbell, and who\ncan be depended upon; of course one who understands the country, and who\nwould be really useful?\"\n\n\"Yes, Governor, I do know a very good man, and you know him also; but\nyou know the worst part of him, for he is generally in trouble when you\nsee him.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Martin Super, the trapper.\"\n\n\"Why, that is the young fellow who breeds such disturbances, and who, if\nI recollect right, is now in prison for a riot.\"\n\n\"The very same, sir; but Martin Super, although a troublesome fellow at\nQuebec, is worth his weight in gold when he is out of the town. You may\nthink it strange, Mr. Campbell, that I should recommend a man who\nappears to be so unruly a character; but the fact is that the trappers,\nwho go in pursuit of the game for their skins, after having been out for\nmonths, undergoing every privation that can be imagined, return home\nwith their packages of skins, which they dispose of to the merchants of\nthis town; and as soon as they have their money, they never cease their\nrevelry of every description until their earnings are all gone, and then\nthey set off again on their wild and venturous pursuit. Now Martin\nSuper, like all the rest, must have his fun when he comes back, and\nbeing a very wild fellow, he is often in scrapes when he has drunk too\nmuch, so that he is occasionally put into prison for being riotous; but\nI know him well, he has been with me surveying for months, and when he\nis on service, a more steady, active, and brave man I do not know.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right in recommending him,\" observed the Governor,\n\"he will not be sorry to get out of the gaol, and I have no doubt but\nthat he will conduct himself well if he once agrees to take your\nservice, Mr. Campbell, for one or two years. As for the Canadians, they\nare very harmless, but at the same time very useful. There are\nexceptions, no doubt; but their general character is any thing but that\nof activity and courage. As I said before, you will require stout\nhearts, and Martin Super is one, that is certain. Perhaps you can\narrange this for Mr. Campbell?\"\n\nThe Surveyor-General promised to do so; shortly after which, Mr.\nCampbell, with many thanks, took his leave of the Governor.\n\nMr. Campbell, who had gained every possible information relative to what\nwould be most necessary for him to take with him, was actively employed\nfor a fortnight in making his purchases. During this time much attention\nwas shown to them both by the English and French residents at Quebec.\nAlfred, whose wound was now nearly healed, was as active as usual, and\nHenry was of great assistance to his father in taking inventories and\nmaking out lists, etc. Nor were Mrs. Campbell and the two girls\nunemployed; they had purchased the coarse manufactures of the country,\nand were very busy making dresses for themselves and for the children.\nMr. Campbell had been one morning at Mr. Farquhar's, the merchant's, to\nmake inquiries about a conveyance up to his new purchase (for he had\nconcluded his arrangements with the Surveyor-General), when the Governor\nsent a message by one of his aides-de-camp, to say that it was his\nintention in the course of ten days to send a detachment of soldiers up\nto Fort Frontignac--news having been received that the garrison was\nweakened by a fever which had broken out; and that if Mr. Campbell would\nlike to avail himself of the opportunity, he and his family, and all his\nluggage, should go under the escort of the officer and troops. The offer\nwas of course joyfully accepted, and on Mr. Campbell's calling upon the\nGovernor to return his thanks, the latter told him that there would be\nplenty of room in the _bateaux_ and canoes for them and all their\nluggage, and that he need not give himself further trouble, or incur any\nfurther expense.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe next day the Surveyor-General called, bringing with him Martin\nSuper, the trapper.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell,\" said the Surveyor, \"this is my friend Martin Super; I\nhave spoken to him, and he has consented to take service for one year,\nand he will remain, if he is satisfied. If he serves you as well as he\nhas served me when I have traveled through the country, I have no doubt\nbut you will find him a valuable assistant.\"\n\nMartin Super was rather tall, very straight-limbed, showing both\nactivity and strength. His head was smaller than usually is the case,\nwhich gave him the appearance of great lightness and agility. His\ncountenance was very pleasing, being expressive of continual good humor,\nwhich was indeed but corresponding to his real character. He was dressed\nin a sort of hunting-coat of deer-skin, blue cloth leggings, a cap of\nraccoon's skin, with a broad belt round his waist, in which he wore his\nknife.\n\n\"Now, Martin Super, I will read the terms of the agreement between you\nand Mr. Campbell, that you may see if all is as you wish.\"\n\nThe Surveyor-General read the agreement, and Martin nodded his head in\nacquiescence.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell, if you are satisfied, you may now sign it; Martin shall\ndo the same.\"\n\nMr. Campbell signed his name, and handed the pen to Martin Super, who\nthen for the first time spoke.\n\n\"Surveyor, I don't know how my name is spelt; and if I did, I couldn't\nwrite it, so I must do it Indian fashion, and put my totem to it?\"\n\n\"What is your name among the Indians, Martin?\"\n\n\"The Painter,\" replied Martin, who then made under Mr. Campbell's name,\na figure like [Illustration of a panther] saying, \"There, that's my name\nas near as I can draw it.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" replied the Surveyor-General; \"here is the document all\nright, Mr. Campbell. Ladies, I fear I must run away, for I have an\nengagement. I will leave Martin Super, Mr. Campbell, as you would\nprobably like a little conversation together.\"\n\nThe Surveyor-General then took his leave, and Martin Super remained.\nMrs. Campbell was the first who spoke: \"Super,\" said she, \"I hope we\nshall be very good friends, but now tell me what you mean by\nyour--totem, I think you called it?\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, a totem is an Indian's mark, and you know I am almost an\nIndian myself. All the Indian chiefs have their totems. One is called\nthe Great Otter; another the Serpent, and so on, and so they sign a\nfigure like the animal they are named from. Then, ma'am, you see, we\ntrappers, who almost live with them, have names given to us also and\nthey have called me the Painter.\"\n\n\"Why did they name you the Painter?\"\n\n\"Because I killed two of them in one day.\"\n\n\"Killed two painters!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"Yes, miss; killed them both with my rifle.\"\n\n\"But why did you kill the men?\" said Emma; \"was it in battle?\"\n\n\"Kill the men, miss; I said nothing about men; I said I killed two\npainters,\" replied Martin, laughing, and showing a row of teeth as white\nas ivory.\n\n\"What is a painter, then, Super?\" inquired Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Why, it's an animal, and a very awkward creature, I can tell you,\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"The drawing is something like a panther, mamma,\" exclaimed Mary.\n\n\"Well, miss, it may be a panther, but we only know them by the other\nname.\"\n\nMr. Farquhar then came in, and the question was referred to him; he\nlaughed and told them that painters were a species of panther, not\nspotted but tawny-colored, and at times very dangerous.\n\n\"Do you know the part of the country where we are going to?\" said Henry\nto Super.\n\n\"Yes, I have trapped thereabouts for months, but the beavers are scarce\nnow.\"\n\n\"Are there any other animals there?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Martin, \"small game, as we term it.\"\n\n\"What sort are they?\"\n\n\"Why, there's painters, and bears, and catamounts.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! do you call that small game? why, what must the large be,\nthen?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Buffaloes, missus, is what we call big game.\"\n\n\"But the animals you speak of are not good eating, Super,\" said Mrs.\nCampbell; \"is there no game that we can eat?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, plenty of deer and wild turkey, and bear's good eating, I\nreckon.\"\n\n\"Ah! that sounds better.\"\n\nAfter an hour's conversation, Martin Super was dismissed; the whole of\nthe family (except Alfred, who was not at home) very much pleased with\nwhat they had seen of him.\n\nA few days after this, Martin Super, who had now entered upon service,\nand was very busy with Alfred, with whom he had already become a\nfavorite, was sent for by Mr. Campbell, who read over to him the\ninventory of the articles which they had, and inquired of him if there\nwas any thing else which might be necessary or advisable to take with\nthem.\n\n\"You said something about guns,\" replied Martin, \"what sort of guns did\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"We have three fowling-pieces and three muskets, besides pistols.\"\n\n\"Fowling-pieces,--they are bird-guns, I believe,--no use at all; muskets\nare soldiers' tools,--no use; pistols are pops, and nothing better. You\nhave no rifles; you can't go into the woods without rifles. I have got\nmine, but you must have some.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe you are right, Martin; it never occurred to me. How\nmany ought we to have?\"\n\n\"Well, that's according--how many be you in family?\"\n\n\"We are five males and three females.\"\n\n\"Well, then, sir, say ten rifles; that will be quite sufficient. Two\nspare ones in case of accident,\" replied Martin.\n\n\"Why, Martin,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"you do not mean that the children\nand these young ladies and I are to fire off rifles?\"\n\n\"I do mean to say, ma'am, that before I was as old as that little boy,\"\npointing to John, \"I could hit a mark well; and a woman ought at least\nto know how to prime and load a rifle, even if she does not fire it\nherself. It is a deadly weapon, ma'am, and the greatest leveler in\ncreation, for the trigger pulled by a child will settle the business of\nthe stoutest man. I don't mean to say that we may be called to use them\nin that way, but it's always better to have them, and to let other\npeople know that you have them, and all ready loaded too, if required.\"\n\n\"Well, Martin,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"I agree with you, it is better to be\nwell prepared. We will have the ten rifles, if we can afford to purchase\nthem. What will they cost?\"\n\n\"About sixteen dollars will purchase the best, sir; but I think I had\nbetter choose them for you, and try them before you purchase.\"\n\n\"Do so, then, Super; Alfred will go with you as soon as he comes back,\nand you and he can settle the matter.\"\n\n\"Why, Super,\" observed Mrs. Campbell, \"you have quite frightened us\nwomen at the idea of so many firearms being required.\"\n\n\"If Pontiac was alive, missus, they would all be required, but he's gone\nnow; still there are many outlying Indians, as we call them, who are no\nbetter than they should be; and I always like to see rifles ready\nloaded. Why, ma'am, suppose now that all the men were out in the woods,\nand a bear should pay you a visit during your absence, would it not be\njust as well for to have a loaded rifle ready for him; and would not you\nor the young misses willingly prefer to pull the trigger at him than to\nbe hugged in his fashion?\"\n\n\"Martin Super, you have quite convinced me: I shall not only learn to\nload a rifle but to fire one also.\"\n\n\"And I'll teach the boys the use of them, ma'am, and they will then add\nto your defense.\"\n\n\"You shall do so, Martin,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"I am convinced that\nyou are quite right.\"\n\nWhen Super had quitted the room, which he did soon afterward, Mr.\nCampbell observed--\"I hope, my dear, that you and the girls are not\nterrified by the remarks of Martin. It is necessary to be well armed\nwhen isolated as we shall be, and so far from any assistance; but it\ndoes not follow, because we ought to be prepared against danger, that\nsuch danger should occur.\"\n\n\"I can answer for myself, my dear Campbell,\" replied his wife; \"I am\nprepared, if necessary, to meet danger, and do what a weak woman can do;\nand I feel what Martin says is but too true, that with a rifle in hand,\na woman or a child is on a par with the strongest man.\"\n\n\"And I, my dear uncle,\" said Mary Percival, \"shall, I trust, with the\nblessing of God, know how to do my duty, however peculiar the\ncircumstances may be to a female.\"\n\n\"And I, my dear uncle,\" followed up Emma, laughing, \"infinitely prefer\nfiring off a rifle to being hugged by a bear or an Indian, because of\ntwo evils one should always choose the least.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I see Martin has done no harm, but, on the contrary, he has\ndone good. It is always best to be prepared for the worst, and to trust\nto Providence for aid in peril.\"\n\nAt last all the purchases were completed, and every thing was packed up\nand ready for embarkation. Another message from the Governor was\nreceived, stating that in three days the troops would be embarked, and\nalso informing Mr. Campbell that if he had not purchased any cows or\nhorses, the officer at Fort Frontignac had more cattle than were\nrequisite, and could supply him; which, perhaps, would be preferable to\ncarrying them up so far. Mr. Campbell had spoken about, but not finally\nsettled for, the cows, and therefore was glad to accept the Governor's\noffer. This message was accompanied with a note of invitation to Mr.\nCampbell, the ladies, and Henry and Alfred, to take a farewell dinner at\nGovernment House the day before their departure. The invitation was\naccepted, and Mr. Campbell was introduced to the officer commanding the\ndetachment which was about to proceed to Fort Frontignac, and received\nfrom him every assurance of his doing all he could to make them\ncomfortable. The kindness of the Governor did not end here: he desired\nthe officer to take two large tents for the use of Mr. Campbell, to be\nreturned to the fort when the house had been built, and they were\ncompletely settled. He even proposed that Mrs. Campbell and the Misses\nPercival should remain at Government House until Mr. Campbell had made\nevery preparation to receive them; but this Mrs. Campbell would not\nconsent to, and, with many thanks, she declined the offer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nAlthough it was now the middle of May, it was but a few days before\ntheir departure that there was the least sign of verdure, or the trees\nhad burst into leaf; but in the course of the three days before they\nquitted Quebec, so rapid was the vegetation, that it appeared as if\nsummer had come upon them all at once. The heat was also very great,\nalthough, when they had landed, the weather was piercing cold; but in\nCanada, as well as in Northern America, the transitions from heat to\ncold, and from cold to heat, are very rapid.\n\nMy readers will be surprised to hear that when the winter sets in at\nQuebec, all the animals required for the winter's consumption are at\nonce killed. If the troops are numerous, perhaps three or four hundred\nbullocks are slaughtered and hung up. Every family kill their cattle,\ntheir sheep, pigs, turkeys, fowls, etc., and all are put up in the\ngarrets, where the carcasses immediately freeze hard, and remain quite\ngood and sweet during the six or seven months of severe winter which\noccur in that climate. When any portion of meat is to be cooked, it is\ngradually thawed in lukewarm water, and after that is put to the fire.\nIf put at once to the fire in its frozen state it spoils. There is\nanother strange circumstance which occurs in these cold latitudes; a\nsmall fish, called the snow-fish, is caught during the winter by making\nholes in the thick ice, and these fish coming to the holes in thousands\nto breathe, are thrown out with hand-nets upon the ice, where they\nbecome in a few minutes frozen quite hard, so that, if you wish it, you\nmay break them in half like a rotten stick. The cattle are fed upon\nthese fish during the winter months. But it has been proved, which is\nvery strange, that if, after they have been frozen for twenty-four hours\nor more, you put these fish into water and gradually thaw them as you do\nthe meat, they will recover and swim about again as well as ever. To\nproceed however, with our history,--\n\nMr. Campbell found that, after all his expenses, he had still three\nhundred pounds left, and this money he left in the Quebec Bank, to use\nas he might find necessary. His expenditure had been very great. First,\nthere was the removal of so large a family, and the passage out; then he\nhad procured at Liverpool a large quantity of cutlery and tools,\nfurniture, etc., all of which articles were cheaper there than at\nQuebec. At Quebec he had also much to purchase: all the most expensive\nportion of his house; such as windows ready glazed, stoves, boarding for\nfloors, cupboards, and partitions; salt provisions, crockery of every\ndescription, two small wagons ready to be put together, several casks of\nnails, and a variety of things which it would be too tedious to mention.\nProcuring these, with the expenses of living, had taken away all his\nmoney, except the three hundred pounds I have mentioned.\n\nIt was on the 13th of May that the embarkation took place, and it was\nnot until the afternoon that all was prepared, and Mrs. Campbell and her\nnieces were conducted down to the _bateaux_, which lay at the wharf,\nwith the troops all ready on board of them. The Governor and his\naides-de-camp, besides many other influential people of Quebec, escorted\nthem down, and as soon as they had paid their adieus, the word was\ngiven, the soldiers in the _bateaux_ gave three cheers and away they\nwent from the wharf into the stream. For a short time there was waving\nof handkerchiefs and other tokens of good-will on the part of those who\nwere on the wharf; but that was soon left behind them, and the family\nfound themselves separated from their acquaintances and silently\nlistening to the measured sound of the oars, as they dropped into the\nwater.\n\nAnd it is not to be wondered at that they were silent, for all were\noccupied with their own thoughts. They called to mind the beautiful\npark at Wexton, which they had quitted, after having resided there so\nlong and so happily; the hall, with all its splendor and all its\ncomfort, rose up in their remembrance; each room with its furniture,\neach window with its view, was recalled to their memories; they had\ncrossed the Atlantic, and were now about to leave civilization and\ncomfort behind them--to isolate themselves in the Canadian woods--to\ntrust to their own resources, their own society, and their own\nexertions. It was, indeed, the commencement of a new life, and for which\nthey felt themselves little adapted, after the luxuries they had enjoyed\nin their former condition; but if their thoughts and reminiscences made\nthem grave and silent, they did not make them despairing or repining;\nthey trusted to that Power who alone could protect--who gives and who\ntakes away, and doeth with us as He judges best; and if hope was not\nbuoyant in all of them, still there was confidence, resolution, and\nresignation. Gradually they were roused from their reveries by the\nbeauty of the scenery and the novelty of what met their sight; the\nsongs, also, of the Canadian boatmen were musical and cheering, and by\ndegrees, they had all recovered their usual good spirits.\n\nAlfred was the first to shake off his melancholy feelings and to attempt\nto remove them from others; nor was he unsuccessful. The officer who\ncommanded the detachment of troops, and who was in the same _bateau_\nwith the family, had respected their silence upon their departure from\nthe wharf--perhaps he felt much as they did. His name was Sinclair, and\nhis rank that of senior captain in the regiment--a handsome, florid\nyoung man, tall and well made, very gentleman-like, and very gentle in\nhis manners.\n\n\"How very beautiful the foliage is on that point, mother,\" said Alfred,\nfirst breaking the silence, \"what a contrast between the leaves of the\nsycamore, so transparent and yellow, with the sun behind them, and the\nnew shoots of the spruce fir.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, very lovely,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"and the branches\nof the trees, feathering down as they do to the surface of the water--\"\n\n\"Like good Samaritans,\" said Emma, \"extending their arms, that any\nunfortunate drowning person who was swept away by the stream might save\nhimself by their assistance.\"\n\n\"I had no idea that trees had so much charity or reflection, Emma,\"\nrejoined Alfred.\n\n\"I can not answer for their charity, but, by the side of this clear\nwater, you must allow them reflection, cousin,\" replied Emma.\n\n\"I presume you will add vanity to their attributes?\" answered Alfred;\n\"for they certainly appear to be hanging over the stream that they may\nlook and admire themselves in the glassy mirror.\"\n\n\"Pretty well that for a midshipman; I was not aware that they used such\nchoice language in a cockpit,\" retorted the young lady.\n\n\"Perhaps not, cousin,\" answered Alfred; \"but when sailors are in the\ncompany of ladies, they become refined, from the association.\"\n\n\"Well, I must admit, Alfred, that you are a great deal more polished\nafter you have been a month on shore.\"\n\n\"Thank you, cousin Emma, even for that slight admission,\" replied\nAlfred, laughing.\n\n\"But what is that?\" said Mary Percival, \"at the point, it is a\nvillage--one, two, three houses--just opening upon us?\"\n\n\"That is a raft, Miss Percival, which is coming down the river,\" replied\nCaptain Sinclair. \"You will see when we are nearer to it, that perhaps\nit covers two acres of water, and there are three tiers of timber on it.\nThese rafts are worth many thousand pounds. They are first framed with\nlogs, fastened by wooden tree-nails, and the timber placed within the\nframe. There are, perhaps, from forty to a hundred people on this raft\nto guide it down the stream, and the houses you see are built on it for\nthe accommodation of these people. I have seen as many as fifteen houses\nupon a raft, which will sometimes contain the cargoes of thirty or forty\nlarge ships.\"\n\n\"It is very wonderful how they guide and direct it down the stream,\"\nsaid Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"It is very dexterous; and it seems strange that such an enormous mass\ncan be so guided, but it is done, as you will perceive; there are three\nor four rudders made of long sweeps, and, as you may observe, several\nsweeps on each side.\"\n\nAll the party were now standing up in the sternsheets of the _bateau_ to\nlook at the people on the raft, who amounted to about fifty or sixty\nmen--now running over the top to one side, and dragging at the sweeps,\nwhich required the joint power of seven or eight men to each of\nthem--now passing again over to the opposite sweeps, as directed by the\nsteersmen. The _bateau_ kept well in to the shore, out of the way, and\nthe raft passed them very quickly. As soon as it was clear of the point,\nas their course to Quebec was now straight, and there was a slight\nbreeze down the river, the people on board of the raft hoisted ten or\nfifteen sails upon different masts, to assist them in their descent; and\nthis again excited the admiration of the party.\n\nThe conversation now became general, until the _bateaux_ were made fast\nto the shores of the river, while the men took their dinners, which had\nbeen prepared for them before they left Quebec. After a repose of two\nhours, they again started, and at nightfall arrived at St. Anne's, where\nthey found every thing ready for their reception. Although their beds\nwere composed of the leaves of the maize or Indian corn, they were so\ntired that they found them very comfortable, and at daylight arose quite\nrefreshed, and anxious to continue their route. Martin Super, who, with\nthe two youngest boys, had been placed in a separate boat, had been very\nattentive to the comforts of the ladies after their embarkation; and it\nappeared that he had quite won the hearts of the two boys by his amusing\nanecdotes during the day.\n\nSoon after their embarkation, the name of Pontiac being again mentioned\nby Captain Sinclair, Mrs. Campbell observed--\n\n\"Our man Super mentioned that name before. I confess that I do not know\nany thing of Canadian affairs; I know only that Pontiac was an Indian\nchief. Can you, Captain Sinclair, give us any information relative to a\nperson who appears so well known in the province?\"\n\n\"I shall be happy, Mrs. Campbell, as far as I am able, to satisfy you.\nOn one point, I can certainly speak with confidence, as my uncle was one\nof the detachment in the fort of Detroit at the time that it was so\nnearly surprised, and he has often told the history of the affair in my\npresence. Pontiac was chief of all the Lake tribes of Indians. I will\nnot repeat the names of the different tribes, but his own particular\ntribe was that of the Ottawas. He ruled at the time that the Canadas\nwere surrendered to us by the French. At first, although very proud and\nhaughty, and claiming the sovereignty of the country, he was very civil\nto the English, or at least appeared so to be; for the French had given\nus so bad a reputation with all the northern tribes, that they had\nhitherto shown nothing but the most determined hostility, and appeared\nto hate our very name. They are now inclined to be quiet, and it is to\nbe hoped their fear of us, after the severe conflicts between us, will\ninduce them to remain so. You are, perhaps, aware that the French had\nbuilt many forts at the most commanding spots in the interior and on the\nlakes, all of which, when they gave up the country, were garrisoned by\nour troops, to keep the Indians under control.\n\n\"All these forts are isolated, and communication between them is rare.\nIt was in 1763 that Pontiac first showed his hostility against us, and\nhis determination, if possible, to drive us from the lakes. He was as\ncunning as he was brave; and, as an Indian, showed more generalship than\nmight be expected--that is, according to their system of war, which is\nalways based upon stratagem. His plan of operation was, to surprise all\nour forts at the same time, if he possibly could; and so excellent were\nhis arrangements, that it was only fifteen days after the plan was first\nlaid that he succeeded in gaining possession of all but three; that is,\nhe surprised ten out of thirteen forts. Of course, the attacks were made\nby other chiefs, under his directions, as Pontiac could not be at all\nthe simultaneous assaults.\"\n\n\"Did he murder the garrisons, Capt. Sinclair?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"The major portion of them: some were spared, and afterward were\nransomed at high prices. I ought to have mentioned as a singular\ninstance of the advance of this chief in comparison with other Indians,\nthat at this time he issued bills of credit on slips of bark, signed\nwith his totem, the otter; and that these bills, unlike many of more\ncivilized society, were all taken up and paid.\"\n\n\"That is very remarkable in a savage,\" observed Mrs. Campbell; \"but how\ndid this Pontiac contrive to surprise all the forts?\"\n\n\"Almost the whole of them were taken by a singular stratagem. The\nIndians are very partial to, and exceedingly dexterous at, a game called\nthe 'Baggatiway:' it is played with a ball and a long-handled sort of\nracket. They divide into two parties, and the object of each party is to\ndrive the ball to their own goal. It is something like hurley in England\nor golf in Scotland. Many hundreds are sometimes engaged on both sides;\nand the Europeans are so fond of seeing the activity and dexterity shown\nby the Indians at this game, that it was very common to request them to\nplay it, when they happened to be near the forts. Upon this, Pontiac\narranged his plan, which was that his Indians should commence the game\nof ball under the forts, and after playing a short time, strike the ball\ninto the fort: of course, some of them would go in for it; and having\ndone this two or three times, and recommenced the play to avoid\nsuspicion, they were to strike it over again, and follow it up by a rush\nafter it through the gates: and then, when they were all in, they would\ndraw their concealed weapons, and overpower the unsuspicious garrison.\"\n\n\"It was certainly a very ingenious stratagem,\" observed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"And it succeeded, as I have observed, except on three forts. The one\nwhich Pontiac directed the attack upon himself, and which was that which\nhe was most anxious to obtain, was Detroit, in which, as I have before\nobserved, my uncle was garrisoned; but there he failed, and by a\nsingular circumstance.\"\n\n\"Pray tell us how, Captain Sinclair,\" said Emma; \"you don't know how\nmuch you have interested me.\"\n\n\"And me, too, Captain Sinclair,\" continued Mary.\n\n\"I am very happy that I have been able to wear away any portion of your\ntedious journey, Miss Percival, so I shall proceed with my history.\n\n\"The fort of Detroit was garrisoned by about three hundred men, when\nPontiac arrived there with a large force of Indians, and encamped under\nthe walls, but he had his warriors so mixed up with the women and\nchildren, and brought so many articles for trade, that no suspicion was\ncreated. The garrison had not heard of the capture of the other forts\nwhich had already taken place. At the same time the unusual number of\nthe Indians was pointed out to Major Gladwin, who commanded the fort,\nbut he had no suspicions. Pontiac sent word to the major, that he wished\nto 'have a talk' with him, in order to cement more fully the friendship\nbetween the Indians and the English; and to this Major Gladwin\nconsented, appointing the next day to receive Pontiac and his chiefs in\nthe fort.\n\n\"Now it so happened, that Major Gladwin had employed an Indian woman to\nmake him a pair of moccasins out of a very curious marked elk-skin. The\nIndian woman brought him the moccasins with the remainder of the skin.\nThe Major was so pleased with them that he ordered her to make him a\nsecond pair of moccasins out of the skin, and then told her that she\nmight keep the remainder for herself. The woman having received the\norder, quitted the Major, but instead of leaving the fort, remained\nloitering about till she was observed, and they inquired why she did not\ngo. She replied, that she wanted to return the rest of the skin, as he\nset so great a value on it; and as this appeared strange conduct, she\nwas questioned, and then she said, that if she took away the skin then,\nshe never would be able to return it.\n\n\"Major Gladwin sent for the woman, upon hearing of the expressions which\nshe had used, and it was evident that she wanted to communicate\nsomething, but was afraid; but on being pressed hard and encouraged, and\nassured of protection, she then informed Major Gladwin, that Pontiac and\nhis chiefs were to come into the fort to-morrow, under the plea of\nholding a talk; but that they had cut the barrels of their rifles short,\nto conceal them under their blankets, and that it was their intention,\nat a signal given by Pontiac, to murder Major Gladwin and all his\nofficers who were at the council; while the other warriors, who would\nalso come into the fort with concealed arms, under pretense of trading,\nwould attack the garrison outside.\n\n\"Having obtained this information, Major Gladwin did all he could to put\nthe fort into a state of defense, and took every necessary precaution.\nHe made known to the officers and men what the intentions of the Indians\nwere, and instructed the officers how to act at the council, and the\ngarrison how to meet the pretended traders outside.\n\n\"About ten o'clock, Pontiac and his thirty-six chiefs, with a train of\nwarriors, came into the fort to their pretended council, and were\nreceived with great politeness. Pontiac made his speech, and when he\ncame forward to present the wampum belt, the receipt of which by the\nMajor was, as the Indian woman had informed them, to be the signal for\nthe chiefs and warriors to commence the assault, the Major and his\nofficers drew their swords half out of their scabbards, and the troops,\nwith their muskets loaded and bayonets fixed, appeared outside and in\nthe council-room, all ready to present. Pontiac, brave as he really was,\nturned pale: he perceived that he was discovered, and consequently, to\navoid any open detection, he finished his speech with many professions\nof regard for the English. Major Gladwin then rose to reply to him, and\nimmediately informed him that he was aware of his plot and his murderous\nintentions. Pontiac denied it; but Major Gladwin stepped to the chief,\nand drawing aside his blanket, exposed his rifle cut short, which left\nPontiac and his chiefs without a word to say in reply. Major Gladwin\nthen desired Pontiac to quit the fort immediately, as otherwise he\nshould not be able to restrain the indignation of the soldiers, who\nwould immolate him and all his followers who were outside of the fort.\nPontiac and his chiefs did not wait for a second intimation, but made\nall the haste they could to get outside of the gates.\"\n\n\"Was it prudent in Major Gladwin to allow Pontiac and his chiefs to\nleave, after they had come into the fort with an intent to murder him\nand his men?\" said Henry Campbell. \"Would not the Major have been\njustified in detaining them?\"\n\n\"I certainly think he would have been, and so did my uncle, but Major\nGladwin thought otherwise. He said that he had promised safe conduct and\nprotection to and from the fort before he was aware of the conspiracy;\nand, having made a promise, his honor would not allow him to depart from\nit.\"\n\n\"At all events, the Major, if he erred, erred on the right side,\"\nobserved Alfred. \"I think myself that he was too scrupulous, and that I\nin his place should have detained some of them, if not Pontiac himself,\nas a hostage for the good behavior of the rest of the tribes.\"\n\n\"The result proved that if Major Gladwin had done so he would have done\nwisely; for the next day Pontiac, not at all disarmed by Major Gladwin's\nclemency, made a most furious attack upon the fort. Every stratagem was\nresorted to, but the attack failed. Pontiac then invested it, cut off\nall their supplies, and the garrison was reduced to great distress. But\nI must break off now, for here we are at Trois Rivières, where we shall\nremain for the night, I hope you will not find your accommodations very\nuncomfortable, Mrs. Campbell: I fear as we advance you will have to put\nup with worse.\"\n\n\"And we are fully prepared for it, Captain Sinclair,\" replied Mr.\nCampbell; \"but my wife and my nieces have too much good sense to expect\nLondon hotels in the wilds of Canada.\"\n\nThe _bateaux_ were now on shore, and the party landed to pass the night\nat the small stockaded village of Trois Rivières.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nCaptain Sinclair having stated that they would have a longer journey on\nthe following day, and that it would be advisable to start as soon as\npossible, they rose at daylight, and in half an hour had breakfasted and\nwere again in the boats. Soon after they had pushed into the stream and\nhoisted the sails, for the wind was fair, Mr. Campbell inquired how far\nthey had to go on that day?\n\n\"About fifty miles if we possibly can,\" replied Captain Sinclair. \"We\nhave made seventy-two miles in the first two days; but from here to\nMontreal, it is about ninety, and we are anxious to get the best part\nover to-day, so that we may land on a cleared spot which we know of, and\nthat I feel quite sure in; for, I regret to say you must trust to your\ntents and your own bedding for the night, as there is no habitation\nlarge enough to receive us on the river's side, any where near where we\nwish to arrive.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Captain Sinclair, we shall sleep very well, I dare say,\"\nreplied Mrs. Campbell; \"but where do all the rest of the party\nsleep?--there is only one tent.\"\n\n\"Oh! never mind the rest of the party; we are used to it, and your\ngentlemen won't mind it; some will sleep in the _bateaux_, some at the\nfire, some will watch and not sleep at all.\"\n\nAfter some further conversation, Mary Percival observed to Captain\nSinclair: \"You had not, I believe, Captain Sinclair, quite finished your\naccount of Pontiac where you left off yesterday, at the time when he was\nblocking the fort at Detroit. Will you oblige us by stating what\nafterward took place?\"\n\n\"With great pleasure, Miss Percival. There was great difficulty in\nrelieving the fort, as all communication had been cut off; at last the\nGovernor sent his aide-de-camp, Captain Dalyell, who contrived to throw\nhimself in the fort with about two hundred and fifty men. He shortly\nafterward sallied out to attack the intrenchments of the Indians, but\nPontiac having received intelligence of his intention, laid an ambuscade\nfor him, beat back the troops with great loss, and poor Dalyell fell in\nthe combat, that took place near a bridge which still goes by the name\nof Bloody Bridge. Pontiac cut off the head of Captain Dalyell, and set\nit upon a post.\"\n\n\"So much for Major Gladwin's extreme sense of honor,\" exclaimed Alfred;\n\"had he detained Pontiac as a prisoner, nothing of this would have\nhappened.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Mr. Alfred,\" replied Captain Sinclair, \"it was\nletting loose a wolf; but Major Gladwin thought he was doing what was\nright, and therefore can not be well blamed. After this defeat, the\ninvestment was more strict than ever, and the garrison suffered\ndreadfully. Several vessels which were sent out to supply the garrison\nfell into the hands of Pontiac, who treated the men very cruelly. What\nwith the loss of men and constant watching, as well as the want of\nprovisions, the garrison was reduced to the greatest privations. At last\na schooner came off with supplies, which Pontiac, as usual, attacked\nwith his warriors in their canoes. The schooner was obliged to stand out\nagain, but the Indians followed, and by their incessant fire killed or\nwounded almost every man on board her, and at length boarded and took\npossession. As they were climbing up the shrouds and over the gunnel of\nthe vessel, the captain of the vessel, who was a most determined man,\nand resolved not to fall into the hands of the Indians, called out to\nthe gunner to set fire to the magazine, and blow them all up together.\nThis order was heard by one of Pontiac's chiefs acquainted with English;\nhe cried out to one of the other Indians, and sprang away from the\nvessel; the other Indians followed him, and hurried away in their\ncanoes, or by swimming as fast as they could from the vessel. The\ncaptain took advantage of the wind and arrived safe at the fort; and\nthus was the garrison relieved and those in the fort saved from\ndestruction by the courage of this one man.\"\n\n\"You say that Pontiac is now dead, at least Martin Super told us so. How\ndid he die, Captain Sinclair?\" inquired Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"He was killed by an Indian, but it is difficult to say why. For many\nyears he had made friends with us and he had received a liberal pension\nfrom the Government; but it appears that his hatred against the English\nhad again broken out, and in a council held by the Indians, he proposed\nassailing us anew. After he had spoken, an Indian buried his knife in\nhis heart, but whether to gratify a private animosity or to avoid a\nfurther warfare with those who had always thinned their tribes, it is\ndifficult to ascertain. One thing is certain, that most of the Indian\nanimosity against the English is buried with him.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Captain Sinclair,\" said Mary Percival, \"for taking so much\ntrouble. I think Pontiac's history is a very interesting one.\"\n\n\"There was much to admire and much to deplore in his character, and we\nmust not judge the Indian too harshly. He was formed for command, and\npossessed great courage and skill in all his arrangements, independent\nof his having the tact to keep all the Lake tribes of Indians\ncombined,--no very easy task. That he should have endeavored to drive us\naway from those lands of which he considered himself (and very correctly\ntoo) as the sovereign, is not to be wondered at, especially as our\nencroachments daily increased. The great fault of his character, in our\neyes, was his treachery; but we must remember that the whole art of\nIndian warfare is based upon stratagem.\"\n\n\"But his attacking the fort after he had been so generously dismissed\nwhen his intentions were known, was surely very base,\" remarked Mrs.\nCampbell.\n\n\"What we consider a generous dismissal, he probably mistook for folly\nand weakness. The Indians have no idea of generosity in warfare. Had\nPontiac been shot, he would have died bravely, and he had no idea that,\nbecause Major Gladwin did not think proper to take his life, he was\ntherefore bound to let us remain in possession of his lands. But\nwhatever treachery the Indians consider allowable and proper in warfare,\nit is not a portion of the Indian character; for at any other time his\nhospitality and good faith are not to be doubted, if he pledges himself\nfor your safety. It is a pity that they are not Christians. Surely it\nwould make a great improvement in a character which, even in its\nunenlightened state, has in it much to be admired.\n\n\"When the form of worship and creed is simple, it is difficult to make\nconverts, and the Indian is a clear reasoner. I once had a conversation\nwith one of the chiefs on the subject. After we had conversed for some\ntime, he said, 'You believe in one God--so do we; you call him by one\nname--we call him another; we don't speak the same language, that is the\nreason. You say, suppose you do good, you go to the land of Good\nSpirits--we say so too. Then Indians and Yangees (that is English) both\ntry to gain the same object, only try in not the same way. Now I think\nit much better that, as we all go along together, that every man paddle\nhis own canoe. That is my thought.'\"\n\n\"It is, as you say, Captain Sinclair, difficult to argue with men who\nlook so straight forward and are so practical in their ideas.\nNevertheless,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"a false creed must often lead to\nfalse conduct; and whatever is estimable in the Indian character would\nbe strengthened and improved by the infusion of Christian principles and\nChristian hopes,--so that I must still consider it very desirable that\nthe Indians should become Christians,--and I trust that by judicious and\ndiscreet measures such a result may gradually be brought about.\"\n\nIt was two hours before sunset when they arrived at the spot at which\nthey intended passing the night; they landed, and some of the soldiers\nwere employed in setting up the tent on a dry hillock, while others\ncollected logs of wood for the fire. Martin Super brought on shore the\nbedding, and, assisted by Alfred and Henry, placed it in the tent.\nCaptain Sinclair's canteen provided sufficient articles to enable them\nto make tea, and in less than half an hour the kettle was on the fire.\nAs soon as they had partaken of these refreshments and the contents of a\nbasket of provisions procured at Trois Rivières, the ladies retired for\nthe night. Captain Sinclair stationed sentinels at different posts as a\nsecurity from any intruders, and then the remainder of the troops with\nthe other males composing the party lay down with their feet toward a\nlarge fire, composed of two or three trunks of trees, which blazed for\nmany yards in height. In a short time all was quiet, and all were in\nrepose except the sentinels, the sergeant and corporal, and Captain\nSinclair, who relieved each other.\n\nThe night passed without any disturbance, and the next morning they\nre-embarked and pursued their course. Before sunset they arrived at the\ntown of Montreal, where it was arranged that they should wait a day. Mr.\nCampbell had a few purchases to make here, which he completed. It had\nbeen his intention also, to procure two of the small Canadian horses,\nbut by the advice of Captain Sinclair he abandoned the idea. Captain\nSinclair pointed out to him, that having no forage or means of\nsubsistence for the animals, they would be a great expense to him during\nthe first year without being of much use; and further, that in all\nprobability, when the garrison was relieved at Fort Frontignac on the\nfollowing year, the officers would be too glad to part with their horses\nat a lower price than what they could be purchased for at Montreal.\nHaving a letter of introduction to the Governor, they received every\nattention. The society was almost wholly French; and many of the\ninhabitants called out of politeness, or to gratify their curiosity. The\nFrench ladies shrugged up their shoulders, and exclaimed, \"Est-il\npossible?\" when they heard that the Campbells were about to proceed to\nsuch a distant spot and settle upon it. The French gentlemen told the\nMiss Campbells that it was a great sacrifice to bury so much beauty in\nthe wilderness; but what they said had little effect upon any of the\nparty. Captain Sinclair offered to remain another day if Mr. Campbell\nwished it; but, on the contrary, he was anxious to arrive as soon as\npossible at his destination; and the following morning they again\nembarked, having now about three hundred and sixty miles to ascend\nagainst the current and the occasional rapids. It would take too much\nspace if I were to narrate all that took place during their difficult\nascent; how they were sometimes obliged to land and carry the cargoes of\nthe boats; how one or two _bateaux_ were upset and some of their stores\nlost; and how their privations increased on each following day of their\njourney. I have too much to relate to enter into this portion of the\nnarrative, although there might be much interest in the detail; it will\nbe sufficient to say that, after sixteen days of some peril and much\nfatigue, and of considerable suffering from the clouds of musquitoes\nwhich assailed them during the night, they were landed safely at Fort\nFrontignac, and treated with every attention by the commandant, who had\nreceived letters from the Governor of Quebec, desiring him to do all\nthat he possibly could to serve them. The commandant, Colonel Forster,\nhad shown Mr. Campbell and his party the rooms which had been provided\nfor them, and now, for the first time after many days, they found\nthemselves all together and alone.\n\nAfter a short conversation, in which they canvassed and commented upon\nthe kindness which they had received, and the difficulties which they\nhad, in consequence, surmounted, during their long and tedious journey\nto Quebec, Mr. Campbell observed: \"My dear wife and children, we have\nthus far proceeded without serious casualty: it has pleased the Almighty\nto conduct us safely over a boisterous sea, to keep our spirits up by\nproviding us with unexpected friends and support, and we now have\narrived within a few miles of our destination. But let us not suppose\nthat our perils and difficulties are terminated; on the contrary,\nwithout wishing to dishearten you, I feel that they are about to\ncommence. We have much privation, much fatigue, and, perhaps, much\ndanger to encounter, before we can expect to be in comfort or in\nsecurity; but we must put our trust in that gracious Providence which\nhas hitherto so mercifully preserved us, and at the same time not relax\nin our own energy and industry, which must ever accompany our faith in\nthe Divine aid. It is long since we have had an opportunity of being\ngathered together and alone. Let us seize this opportunity of pouring\nout our thanks to God for his mercies already vouchsafed, and praying\nfor a continuance of his protection. Even in the wilderness, let us walk\nwith Him, trust in Him, and ever keep Him in our thoughts. We must bear\nin mind that this entire life is but a pilgrimage; that if, during its\ncourse, we should meet with affliction or distress, it is His\nappointment, and designed undoubtedly for our good. It is our wisdom, as\nwell as duty to submit patiently to whatever may befall us, never losing\nour courage or becoming disheartened by suffering, but trusting to the\nmercy and power of Him who can and will, at His own good time, deliver\nus from evil.\" Mr. Campbell kneeled down, surrounded by his family, and,\nin a fervent and feeling address poured forth his thanksgiving for past\nmercies and humble solicitation for further assistance. So powerful and\nso eloquent were his words, that the tears coursed down the cheeks of\nhis wife and nieces; and when he had finished, all their hearts were so\nfull, that they retired to their beds without further exchange of words\nthan receiving his blessing, and wishing each other good-night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nThe party were so refreshed by once more sleeping upon good beds, that\nthey were up and dressed very early, and shortly after seven o'clock\nwere all collected upon the rampart of the fort, surveying the\nlandscape, which was indeed very picturesque and beautiful. Before them,\nto their left, the lake was spread, an inland sea, lost in the horizon,\nnow quite calm, and near to the shores studded with small islands\ncovered with verdant foliage, and appearing as if they floated upon the\ntransparent water. To the westward, and in front of them, were the\nclearings belonging to the fort, backed with the distant woods: a herd\nof cattle were grazing on a portion of the cleared land; the other was\ndivided off by a snake fence, as it is termed, and was under\ncultivation. Here and there a log-building was raised as a shelter for\nthe animals during the winter, and at half a mile's distance was a small\nfort, surrounded with high palisades, intended as a place of retreat and\nsecurity for those who might be in charge of the cattle, in case of\ndanger or surprise. Close to the fort, a rapid stream, now from the\nfreshets overflowing its banks, poured down its waters into the lake,\nrunning its course through a variety of shrubs and larches and\noccasional elms which lined its banks. The sun shone bright--the\nwoodpeckers flew from tree to tree, or clung to the rails of the\nfences--the belted kingfisher darted up and down over the running\nstream--and the chirping and wild notes of various birds were heard on\nevery side of them.\n\n\"This is very beautiful, is it not?\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"surely it can\nnot be so great a hardship to live in a spot like this?\"\n\n\"Not if it were always so, perhaps, madam,\" said Colonel Forster, who\nhad joined the party as Mrs. Campbell made the observation. \"But Canada\nin the month of June is very different from Canada in the month of\nJanuary. That we find our life monotonous in this fort, separated as we\nare from the rest of the world, I admit, and the winters are so long and\nsevere as to tire our patience; but soldiers must do their duty, whether\nburning under the tropics or freezing in the wilds of Canada. It can not\nbe a very agreeable life, when even the report of danger near to us\nbecomes a pleasurable feeling from the excitement it causes for the\nmoment.\n\n\"I have been talking, Mr. Campbell, with Captain Sinclair, and find you\nhave much to do before the short summer is over, to be ready to meet the\ncoming winter; more than you can well do with your limited means. I am\nhappy that my instructions from the Governor will permit me to be of\nservice to you. I propose that the ladies shall remain here, while you,\nwith such assistance as I can give you, proceed to your allotment and\nprepare for their reception.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks for your kind offer, Colonel--but no, no, we will all\ngo together,\" interrupted Mrs. Campbell; \"we can be useful, and we will\nremain in the tents till the house is built. Do not say a word more,\nColonel Forster, that is decided; although I again return you many\nthanks for your kind offer.\"\n\n\"If such is the case, I have only to observe that I shall send a fatigue\nparty of twelve men, which I can well spare for a few weeks, to assist\nyou in your labors,\" replied Colonel Forster. \"Their remuneration will\nnot put you to a very great expense. Captain Sinclair has volunteered\nto take charge of it.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, sir,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"and as you observe that we\nhave no time to lose, with your permission we will start to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not dissuade you,\" replied the commandant, \"although\nI did hope that I should have had the pleasure of your company for a\nlittle longer. You are aware that I have the Governor's directions to\nsupply you with cattle from our own stock, at a fair price. I hardly\nneed say that you may select as you please.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Captain Sinclair, who had been in conversation with Mary\nPercival, and who now addressed Mr. Campbell, \"have been making another\ncollection for you among my brother-officers, which you were not\nprovided with, and will find very useful, I may say absolutely\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"What may that be, Captain Sinclair?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"A variety of dogs of every description. I have a pack of five; and,\nalthough not quite so handsome as your pet dogs in England, you will\nfind them well acquainted with the country, and do their duty well. I\nhave a pointer, a bull-dog, two terriers, and a fox-hound--all of them\nof good courage, and ready to attack catamount, wolf, lynx, or even a\nbear, if required.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, a very valuable present,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"and you\nhave our sincere thanks.\"\n\n\"The cows you had better select before you go, unless you prefer that I\nshould do it for you,\" observed Colonel Forster. \"They shall be driven\nover in a day or two, as I presume the ladies will wish to have milk. By\nthe by, Mr. Campbell, I must let you into a secret. The wild onions\nwhich grow so plentiful in this country, and which the cattle are very\nfond of, give a very unpleasant taste to the milk. You may remove it by\nheating the milk as soon as it has been drawn from the cows.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, Colonel, for your information,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"for\nI certainly have no great partiality to the flavor of onions in milk.\"\n\nA summons to breakfast broke up the conversation. During the day, Henry\nand Alfred, assisted by Captain Sinclair and Martin Super, were very\nbusy in loading the two _bateaux_ with the stores, tents, and various\ntrunks of linen and other necessaries which they had brought with them.\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell, with the girls, were equally busy in selecting\nand putting on one side articles for immediate use on their arrival at\nthe allotment. As they were very tired, they went to bed early, that\nthey might be ready for the next day's re-embarkation; and after\nbreakfast, having taken leave of the kind commandant and the other\nofficers, they went down to the shore of the lake, and embarked with\nCaptain Sinclair in the commandant's boat, which had been prepared for\nthem. Martin Super, Alfred and Henry, with the five dogs, went on board\nof the two _bateaux_, which were manned by the corporal and twelve\nsoldiers, lent by the commandant to Mr. Campbell. The weather was\nbeautifully fine, and they set off in high spirits. The distance by\nwater was not more three miles, although by land it was nearly five, and\nin half an hour they entered the cove adjoining to which the allotment\nlay.\n\n\"There is the spot, Mrs. Campbell, which is to be your future\nresidence,\" said Captain Sinclair, pointing with his hand; \"you observe\nwhere that brook runs down into the lake, that is your eastern boundary;\nthe land on the other side is the property of the old hunter we have\nspoken of. You see his little log-hut, not much bigger than an Indian\nlodge, and the patch of Indian corn now sprung out of the ground which\nis inclosed by the fence. This portion appears not to be of any use to\nhim, as he has no cattle of any kind, unless indeed they have gone into\nthe bush; but I think some of our men said that he lived entirely by the\nchase, and that he has an Indian wife.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Emma Percival, laughing, \"female society is what we never\ncalculated upon. What is the man's name?\"\n\n\"Malachi Bone,\" replied Captain Sinclair. \"I presume you expect Mrs.\nBone to call first?\"\n\n\"She ought to do so, if she knows the _usage_ of society,\" replied Emma;\n\"but if she does not, I think I shall waive ceremony and go and see\nher. I have great curiosity to make acquaintance with an Indian squaw.\"\n\n\"You may be surprised to hear me say so, Miss Emma, but I assure you,\nwithout having ever seen her, that you will find her perfectly well\nbred. All the Indian women are--their characters are a compound of\nsimplicity and reserve.--Keep the boat's head more to the right, Selby,\nwe will land close to that little knoll.\"\n\nThe commandant's boat had pulled much faster, and was a long way ahead\nof the _bateaux_. In a few minutes afterward they had all disembarked\nand were standing on the knoll, surveying their new property. A portion\nof about thirty acres, running along the shore of the lake, was what is\ntermed natural prairie, or meadow of short fine grass; the land\nimmediately behind the meadow was covered with brushwood for about three\nhundred yards, and then rose a dark and impervious front of high timber\nwhich completely confined the landscape. The allotment belonging to the\nold hunter, on the opposite side of the brook, contained about the same\nportion of natural meadow, and was in other respects but a continuation\nof the portion belonging to Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Well,\" said Martin Super, as soon as he had come up to the party on the\nknoll, for the _bateaux_ had now arrived, \"I reckon, Mr. Campbell, that\nyou are in luck to have this piece of grass. It would have taken no few\nblows of the ax to have cleared it away out of such a wood as that\nbehind us. Why, it is as good as a fortune to a new settler.\"\n\n\"I think it is, Martin,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Well, sir, now to work as soon as you please, for a day is a day, and\nmust not be lost. I'll go to the wood with five or six of the men who\ncan handle an ax, and begin to cut down, leaving you and the captain\nthere to decide where the house is to be; the other soldiers will be\nputting up the tents all ready for to-night, for you must not expect a\nhouse over your heads till next full moon.\"\n\nIn a quarter of an hour all were in motion. Henry and Alfred took their\naxes, and followed Martin Super and half of the soldiers, the others\nwere busy landing the stores and pitching the tents, while Captain\nSinclair and Mr. Campbell were surveying the ground, that they might\nchoose a spot for the erection of the house. Mrs. Campbell remained\nsitting on the knoll, watching the debarkation of the packages; and\nPercival, by her directions, brought her those articles which were for\nimmediate use. Mary and Emma Percival, accompanied by John, as they had\nno task allotted to them, walked up the side of the stream toward the\nwood.\n\n\"I wish I had my box,\" said John, who had been watching the running\nwater.\n\n\"Why do you want your box, John?\" said Mary.\n\n\"For my hooks in my box,\" replied John.\n\n\"Why, do you see any fish in this small stream?\" said Emma.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied John, walking on before them.\n\nMary and Emma followed him, now and then stopping to pick a flower\nunknown to them: when they overtook John, he was standing immovable,\npointing to a figure on the other side of the stream, as fixed and\nmotionless as himself.\n\nThe girls started back as they beheld a tall, gaunt man, dressed in deer\nhides, who stood leaning upon a long gun with his eyes fixed upon them.\nHis face was browned and weather-beaten--indeed so dark that it was\ndifficult to say if he were of the Indian race or not.\n\n\"It must be a hunter, Emma,\" said Mary Percival; \"he is not dressed like\nthe Indians we saw at Quebec.\"\n\n\"It must be,\" replied Emma; \"won't he speak?\"\n\n\"We will wait and see,\" replied Mary. They did wait for a minute or\nmore, but the man neither spoke nor shifted his position.\n\n\"I will speak to him, Mary,\" said Emma at last. \"My good man, you are\nMalachi Bone, are you not?\"\n\n\"That's my name,\" replied the hunter in a deep voice; \"and who on earth\nare you, and what are you doing here? Is it a frolic from the fort, or\nwhat is it, that causes all this disturbance?\"\n\n\"Disturbance!--why we don't make a great deal of noise; no, it's no\nfrolic; we are come to settle here, and shall be your neighbors.\"\n\n[MALACHI.]\n\n\"To settle here!--why, what on earth do you mean, young woman? Settle\nhere!--not you, surely.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, we are. Don't you know Martin Super, the trapper? He is\nwith us, and now at work in the woods getting ready for raising the\nhouse, as you call it.--Do you know, Mary,\" said Emma in a low tone to\nher sister, \"I'm almost afraid of that man, although I do speak so\nboldly.\"\n\n\"Martin Super--yes, I know him,\" replied the hunter, who without any\nmore ceremony threw his gun into the hollow of his arm, turned round,\nand walked away in the direction of his own hut.\n\n\"Well, Mary,\" observed Emma, after a pause of a few seconds, during\nwhich they watched the receding form of the hunter, \"the old gentleman\nis not over-polite. Suppose we go back and narrate our first adventure?\"\n\n\"Let us walk up to where Alfred and Martin Super are at work, and tell\nthem,\" replied Mary.\n\nThey soon gained the spot where the men were felling the trees, and made\nknown to Alfred and Martin what had taken place.\n\n\"He is angered, miss,\" observed Martin; \"I guessed as much; well, if he\ndon't like it he must squat elsewhere.\"\n\n\"How do you mean squat elsewhere?\"\n\n\"I mean, miss, that if he don't like company so near him he must shift\nand build his wigwam further off.\"\n\n\"But, why should he not like company? I should have imagined that it\nwould be agreeable rather than otherwise,\" replied Mary Percival.\n\n\"You may think so, miss; but Malachi Bone thinks otherwise; and it's\nnatural; a man who has lived all his life in the woods, all alone, his\neye never resting, his ear ever watching; catching at every sound, even\nto the breaking of a twig or the falling of a leaf; sleeping with his\nfinger on his trigger and one eye half open, gets used to no company but\nhis own, and can't abide it. I recollect the time that I could not. Why,\nmiss, when a man hasn't spoken a word perhaps for months, talking is a\nfatigue, and, when he hasn't heard a word spoken for months, listening\nis as bad. It's all custom, miss, and Malachi, as I guessed, don't like\nit, and so he's _rily_ and angered. I will go see him after the work is\nover.\"\n\n\"But he has a wife, Martin, has he not?\"\n\n\"Yes; but she's an Indian wife, Master Alfred, and Indian wives don't\nspeak unless they're spoken to.\"\n\n\"What a recommendation,\" said Alfred, laughing; \"I really think I shall\nlook after an Indian wife, Emma.\"\n\n\"I think you had better,\" replied Emma. \"You'd be certain of a quiet\nhouse,--when _you_ were out of it,--and when at home, you would have all\nthe talk to yourself, which is just what you like. Come, Mary, let us\nleave him to dream of his squaw.\"\n\nThe men selected by the commandant of the fort were well used to handle\nthe ax; before dusk, many trees had been felled, and were ready for\nsawing into lengths. The tents had all been pitched: those for the\nCampbells on the knoll we have spoken of; Captain Sinclair's and that\nfor the soldiers about a hundred yards distant; the fires were lighted,\nand as the dinner had been cold, a hot supper was prepared by Martin and\nMrs. Campbell, assisted by the girls and the younger boys. After supper\nthey all retired to an early bed; Captain Sinclair having put a man as\nsentry, and the dogs having been tied at different places, that they\nmight give the alarm if there was any danger; which, however, was not\nanticipated, as the Indians had for some time been very quiet in the\nneighborhood of Fort Frontignac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe next morning, when they assembled at breakfast, after Mr. Campbell\nhad read the prayers, Mary Percival said, \"Did you hear that strange and\nloud noise last night? I was very much startled with it; but, as nobody\nsaid a word, I held my tongue.\"\n\n\"Nobody said a word, because every body was fast asleep, I presume,\"\nsaid Alfred; \"I heard nothing.\"\n\n\"It was like the sound of cart-wheels at a distance, with whistling and\nhissing,\" continued Mary.\n\n\"I think I can explain it to you, as I was up during the night, Miss\nPercival,\" said Captain Sinclair. \"It is a noise you must expect every\nnight during the summer season; but one to which you will soon be\naccustomed.\"\n\n\"Why, what was it?\"\n\n\"Frogs,--nothing more; except, indeed, the hissing, which, I believe, is\nmade by the lizards. They will serenade you every night. I only hope you\nwill not be disturbed by any thing more dangerous.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that such small creatures can make such a din?\"\n\n\"Yes; when thousands join in the concert; I may say millions.\"\n\n\"Well, I thank you for the explanation, Captain Sinclair, as it has been\nsome relief to my mind.\"\n\nAfter breakfast, Martin (we shall for the future leave out his surname)\ninformed Mr. Campbell that he had seen Malachi Bone, the hunter, who had\nexpressed great dissatisfaction at their arrival, and his determination\nto quit the place if they remained.\n\n\"Surely, he hardly expects us to quit the place to please him?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Martin; \"but if he were cankered in disposition, which I\nwill say Malachi is not, he might make it very unpleasant for you to\nremain, by bringing the Indians about you.\"\n\n\"Surely, he would not do that?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"No, I don't think he would,\" replied Martin; \"because, you see, it's\njust as easy for him to go further off.\"\n\n\"But why should we drive him away from his property any more than we\nleave our own?\" observed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"He says he won't be crowded, ma'am; he can't bear to be crowded.\"\n\n\"Why, there's a river between us.\"\n\n\"So there is, ma'am, but still that's his feeling. I said to him, that\nif he would go, I dared say Mr. Campbell would buy his allotment of\nhim, and he seems to be quite willing to part with it.\"\n\n\"It would be a great addition to your property, Mr. Campbell,\" observed\nCaptain Sinclair. \"In the first place, you would have the whole of the\nprairie and the right of the river on both sides, apparently of no\nconsequence now, but as the country fills up, most valuable.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"as I presume we shall remain here, or, at\nall events, those who survive me will, till the country fills up, I\nshall be most happy to make any arrangement with Bone for the purchase\nof his property.\"\n\n\"I'll have some more talk with him, sir,'\" replied Martin.\n\nThe second day was passed as was the first, in making preparations for\nerecting the house, which, now that they had obtained such unexpected\nhelp, was, by the advice of Captain Sinclair, considerably enlarged\nbeyond the size originally intended. As Mr. Campbell paid the soldiers\nemployed a certain sum per day for their labor, he had less scruple in\nemploying them longer. Two of them were good carpenters, and a sawpit\nhad been dug, that they might prepare the doors and the frames for the\nwindow-sashes which Mr. Campbell had taken the precaution to bring with\nhim. On the third day, a boat arrived from the fort bringing the men's\nrations and a present of two fine bucks from the commandant. Captain\nSinclair went in the boat to procure some articles which he required,\nand returned in the evening. The weather continued fine, and in the\ncourse of a week, a great deal of timber was cut and squared. During\nthis time, Martin had several meetings with the old hunter, and it was\nagreed that he should sell his property to Mr. Campbell. Money he\nappeared to care little about--indeed it was useless to him; gunpowder,\nlead, flints, blankets, and tobacco, were the principal articles\nrequested in the barter; the amount, however, was not precisely settled.\nAn intimacy had been struck up between the old hunter and John; in what\nmanner it was difficult to imagine, as they both were very sparing of\ntheir words; but this was certain, that John had contrived to get\nacross the stream somehow or another, and was now seldom at home to his\nmeals. Martin reported that he was in the lodge of the old hunter, and\nthat he could come to no harm; so Mrs. Campbell was satisfied.\n\n\"But what does he do there, Martin?\" said Mrs. Campbell, as they were\nclearing away the table after supper.\n\n\"Just nothing but look at the squaw, or at Malachi cleaning his gun, or\nany thing else he may see. He never speaks, that I know of, and that's\nwhy he suits old Malachi.\"\n\n\"He brought home a whole basket of trout this afternoon,\" observed Mary;\n\"so he is not quite idle.\"\n\n\"No, miss; he's fishing at daylight, and gives one-half to you and the\nother to old Bone. He'll make a crack hunter one of these days, as old\nMalachi says. He can draw the bead on the old man's rifle in good style\nalready, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, Martin?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"I mean that he can fire pretty true, ma'am, although it's a heavy gun\nfor him to lift; a smaller one would do better for him.\"\n\n\"But is he not too young to be trusted with a gun, uncle?\" said Mary.\n\n\"No, miss,\" interrupted Martin, \"you can't be too young here; the sooner\na boy is useful the better; and the boy with a gun is almost as good as\na man; for the gun kills equally as well if pointed true. Master\nPercival must have his gun as soon as I am at leisure to teach him.\"\n\n\"I wish you were at leisure now, Martin,\" cried Percival.\n\n\"You forget, aunt, that you promised to learn to load and fire a rifle\nyourself,\" said Mary.\n\n\"No. I do not; and I intend to keep my word, as soon as there is time;\nbut John is so very young.\"\n\n\"Well, Mary, I suppose we must enlist too?\" said Emma.\n\n\"Yes; we'll be the female rifle brigade,\" replied Mary, laughing.\n\n\"I really quite like the idea,\" continued Emma; \"I will put up with no\nimpertinence, recollect, Alfred; excite my displeasure, and I shall take\ndown my rifle.\"\n\n\"I suspect you will do more execution with your eyes, Emma,\" replied\nAlfred, laughing.\n\n\"Not upon a catamount, as Martin calls it. Pray what is a catamount?\"\n\n\"A painter, miss.\"\n\n\"Oh, now I know; a catamount is a painter, a painter is a leopard or a\npanther.--As I live, uncle, here comes the old hunter, with John\ntrotting at his heels. I thought he would come at last. The visit is to\nme, I'm sure, for when we first met he was dumb with astonishment.\"\n\n\"He well might be,\" observed Captain Sinclair; \"he has not often met\nwith such objects as you and your sister in the woods.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Emma; \"an English squaw must be rather a rarity.\"\n\nAs she said this, old Malachi Bone came up, and seated himself, without\nspeaking, placing his rifle between his knees.\n\n\"Your servant, sir,\" said Mr. Campbell; \"I hope you are well.\"\n\n\"What on earth makes you come here?\" said Bone, looking round him. \"You\nare not fit for the wilderness! Winter will arrive soon; and then you go\nback, I reckon.\"\n\n\"No, we shall not,\" replied Alfred, \"for we have nowhere to go back to;\nbesides, the people are too crowded where we came from, so we came here\nfor more room.\"\n\n\"I reckon you'll crowd _me_,\" replied the hunter, \"so I'll go further.\"\n\n\"Well, Malachi, the gentleman will pay you for your clearing.\"\n\n\"I told you so,\" said Martin.\n\n\"Yes, you did; but I'd rather not have seen him or his goods.\"\n\n\"By goods, I suppose you mean us about you?\" said Emma.\n\n\"No, girl, I didn't mean you. I meant gunpowder and the like.\"\n\n\"I think, Emma, you are comprehended in the last word,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"That is more than you are, then, for he did not mention lead,\" retorted\nEmma.\n\n\"Martin Super, you know I did specify lead on the paper,\" said Malachi\nBone.\n\n\"You did, and you shall have it,\" said Mr. Campbell. \"Say what your\nterms are now, and I will close with you.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll leave that to Martin and you, stranger. I clear out\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow; and where do you go to?\"\n\nMalachi Bone pointed to the westward.\n\n\"You'll not hear my rifle,\" said the old hunter, after a pause; \"but I'm\nthinking you'll never stay here. You don't know what an Ingen's life is;\nit ain't fit for the like of you. No, there's not one of you, 'cept this\nboy,\" continued Malachi, putting his hand on John's head, \"that's fit\nfor the woods. Let him come to me. I'll make a hunter of him; won't I,\nMartin?\"\n\n\"That you will, if they'll spare him to you.\"\n\n\"We can not spare him altogether,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"but he shall\nvisit you, if you wish it.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a promise; and I won't go so far as I thought I would. He\nhas a good eye; I'll come for him.\"\n\nThe old man then rose up, and walked away, John following him, without\nexchanging a word with any of the party.\n\n\"My dear Campbell,\" said his wife, \"what do you intend to do about John?\nYou do not intend that the hunter should take him with him?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"but I see no reason why he\nshould not be with him occasionally.\"\n\n\"It will be a very good thing for him to be so,\" said Martin. \"If I may\nadvise, let the boy come and go. The old man has taken a fancy to him,\nand will teach him his woodcraft. It's as well to make a friend of\nMalachi Bone.\"\n\n\"Why, what good can he do us?\" inquired Henry.\n\n\"A friend in need is a friend indeed, sir; and a friend in the\nwilderness is not to be thrown away. Old Malachi is going further out,\nand if danger occurs, we shall know it from him, for the sake of the\nboy, and have his help too, if we need it.\"\n\n\"There is much good sense in Martin Super's remarks, Mr. Campbell,\"\nobserved Captain Sinclair. \"You will then have Malachi Bone as an\nadvanced guard, and the fort to fall back upon, if necessary to\nretreat.\"\n\n\"And, perhaps, the most useful education which he can receive to prepare\nhim for his future life will be from the old hunter.\"\n\n\"The only one which he will take to kindly, at all events,\" observed\nHenry.\n\n\"Let him go, sir; let him go,\" said Martin.\n\n\"I will give no positive answer, Martin,\" replied Mr. Campbell. \"At all\nevents, I will permit him to visit the old man; there can be no\nobjection to that;--but it is bedtime.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nWe must pass over six weeks, during which the labor was continued\nwithout intermission, and the house was raised, of logs, squared and\nwell fitted; the windows and doors were also put in, and the roof well\ncovered in with large squares of birch-bark, firmly fixed on the\nrafters. The house consisted of one large room, as a dining-room, and\nthe kitchen, with a floor of well-beaten clay, a smaller room, as a\nsitting-room, and three bedrooms, all of which were floored; one of the\nlargest of them fitted all round with bed-places against the walls, in\nthe same way as on board of packets; this room was for the four boys,\nand had two spare bed-places in it. The others, which were for the two\ngirls and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, were much smaller. But before the house\nwas half built, a large outhouse adjoining to it had been raised to hold\nthe stores which Mr. Campbell had brought with him, with a rough granary\nmade above the store-room. The interior of the house was not yet fitted\nup, although the furniture had been put in, and the family slept in it,\nrough as it was, in preference to the tents, as they were very much\nannoyed with musquitoes. The stores were now safe from the weather, and\nthey had a roof over their heads, which was the grand object that was to\nbe obtained. The carpenters were still very busy fitting up the interior\nof the house, and the other men were splitting rails for a snake-fence\nand also selecting small timber for raising a high palisade round the\npremises. Martin had not been idle. The site of the house was just where\nthe brushwood joined to the prairie, and Martin had been clearing it\naway and stacking it, and also collecting wood for winter fuel. It had\nbeen decided that the four cows, which had been driven round from the\nfort, should be housed during the winter in the small building on the\nother side of the stream, which had belonged to Malachi Bone, as it was\nsurrounded with a high snake-fence, and sufficiently large to hold them\nand even more. The commandant had very kindly selected the most quiet\ncows to milk, and Mary and Emma Percival had already entered upon their\nduties: the milk had been put into the store-house until a dairy could\nbe built up. A very neat bridge had been thrown across the stream, and\nevery morning the two girls, generally attended by Henry, Alfred, or\nCaptain Sinclair, crossed over, and soon became expert in their new\nvocation as dairy-maids. Altogether, things began to wear a promising\nappearance. Henry and Mr. Campbell had dug up as fast as Martin and\nAlfred cleared away the brushwood, and the garden had already been\ncropped with such few articles as could be put in at the season. The\ncommandant had some pigs ready for the settlers as soon as they were\nready to receive them, and had more than once come up in the boats to\nascertain their progress and to offer any advice that he might consider\nuseful.\n\nWe must not, however, forget Malachi Bone. The day after Bone had come\nto Mr. Campbell, Emma perceived him going away into the woods, with his\nrifle, followed by her cousin John, and being very curious to see his\nIndian wife, she persuaded Alfred and Captain Sinclair to accompany her\nand Mary to the other side of the stream. The great point was to know\nwhere to cross it, but as John had found out the means of so doing, it\nwas to be presumed that there was a passage, and they set off to look\nfor it. They found that, about half a mile up the stream, which there\nran through the wood, a large tree had been blown down and laid across\nit, and with the assistance of the young men, Mary and Emma passed it\nwithout much difficulty; they then turned back by the side of the stream\nuntil they approached the lodge of old Malachi. As they walked toward\nit, they could not perceive any one stirring; but at last a dog of the\nIndian breed began to bark; still nobody came out, and they arrived at\nthe door of the lodge where the dog stood; when, sitting on the floor,\nthey perceived the Indian girl whom they were in search of. She was very\nbusy sewing a pair of moccasins out of deer leather. She appeared\nstartled when she first saw Alfred; but when she perceived that the\nyoung ladies were with him, her confidence returned. She slightly bowed\nher head, and continued her work.\n\n\"How very young she is,\" said Emma; \"why she can not be more than\neighteen years old.\"\n\n\"I doubt if she is so much,\" replied Captain Sinclair.\n\n\"She has a very modest, unaffected look, has she not, Alfred?\" said\nMary.\n\n\"Yes; I think there is something very prepossessing in her countenance.\"\n\n\"She is too young a wife for the old hunter, at all events,\" observed\nAlfred.\n\n\"That is not unusual among the Indians,\" said Captain Sinclair; \"a very\nold chief will often have three or four young wives; they are to be\nconsidered more in the light of his servants than any thing else.\"\n\n\"But she must think us very rude to talk and stare at her in this\nmanner; I suppose she can not speak English.\"\n\n\"I will speak to her in her own language, if she is a Chippeway or of\nany of the tribes about here, for they all have the same dialect,\" said\nCaptain Sinclair.\n\nCaptain Sinclair addressed her in the Indian language, and the Indian\ngirl replied in a very soft voice.\n\n\"She says her husband is gone to bring home venison.\"\n\n\"Tell her we are coming to live here, and will give her any thing she\nwants.\"\n\n[MALACHI AND HIS WIFE.]\n\nCaptain Sinclair again addressed her, and received her answer.\n\n\"She says that you are beautiful flowers, but not the wild flowers of\nthe country, and that the cold winter will kill you.\"\n\n\"Tell her she will find us alive next summer,\" said Emma; \"and, Captain\nSinclair, give her this brooch of mine, and tell her to wear it for my\nsake.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair gave the message and the ornament to the Indian girl,\nwho replied, as she looked up and smiled at Emma,\n\n\"That she would never forget the beautiful lily who was so kind to the\nlittle strawberry-plant.\"\n\n\"Really her language is poetical and beautiful,\" observed Mary; \"I have\nnothing to give her--Oh! yes, I have; here is my ivory needle-case, with\nsome needles in it. Tell her it will be of use to her when she sews her\nmoccasins. Open it and show her what is inside.\"\n\n\"She says that she will be able to work faster and better, and wishes to\nlook at your foot, that she may be grateful; so put your foot out, Miss\nPercival.\"\n\nMary did so; the Indian girl examined it, and smiled and nodded her\nhead.\n\n\"Oh, Captain Sinclair, tell her that the little boy who is gone with her\nhusband is our cousin.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair reported her answer, which was, \"He will be a great\nhunter and bring home plenty of game by and by.\"\n\n\"Well, now, tell her that we shall always be happy to see her, and that\nwe are going home again; and ask her name, and tell her our own.\"\n\nAs Captain Sinclair interpreted, the Indian girl pronounced after him\nthe names of Mary and Emma very distinctly. \"She has your names, you\nperceive; her own, translated into English, is the strawberry-plant.\"\n\nThey then nodded farewell to the young Indian, and returned home. On the\nsecond evening after their visit, as they were at supper, the\nconversation turned upon the hunter and his young Indian wife, when\nJohn, who had, as usual, been silent, suddenly broke out with \"Goes away\nto-morrow!\"\n\n\"They go away to-morrow, John; where do they go to?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Woods,\" replied John.\n\nJohn was correct in his statement. Early the next morning, Malachi Bone,\nwith his rifle on his shoulder and an ax in his hand, was seen crossing\nthe prairie belonging to Mr. Campbell, followed by his wife, who was\nbent double under her burden, which was composed of all the property\nwhich the old hunter possessed, tied up in blankets. He had left word\nthe night before with Martin that he would come back in a few days, as\nsoon as he had squatted, to settle the bargain for his allotment of land\nmade over to Mr. Campbell. This was just before they had sat down to\nbreakfast, and then they observed that John was missing.\n\n\"He was here just before prayers,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"He must have\nslipped away after the old hunter.\"\n\n\"No doubt of that, ma'am,\" said Martin. \"He will go with him and find\nout where he puts up his wigwam, and after that he will come back to\nyou; so there is no use sending after him; indeed, we don't know which\nway to send.\"\n\nMartin was right. Two days afterward, John made his appearance again,\nand remained very quietly at home during the whole week, catching fish\nin the stream or practicing with a bow and some arrows, which he had\nobtained from Malachi Bone; but the boy appeared to be more taciturn and\nmore fond of being alone than even he was before; still he was obedient\nand kind toward his mother and cousins, and was fond of Percival's\ncompany when he went to take trout from the stream.\n\nIt was of course after the departure of the old hunter, that his log hut\nwas taken possession of and the cows put into the meadow in front of it.\n\nAs the work became more advanced, Martin went out every day, accompanied\neither by Alfred or Henry, in pursuit of game. Mr. Campbell had procured\nan ample supply of ammunition, as well as the rifles, at Quebec. These\nhad been unpacked, and the young men were becoming daily more expert. Up\nto the present, the supply of game from the fort, and occasional fresh\nbeef, had not rendered it necessary for Mr. Campbell to have much\nrecourse to his barrels of salt-pork, but still it was necessary that a\nsupply should be procured as often as possible, that they might husband\ntheir stores. Martin was a certain shot if within distance, and they\nseldom returned without a deer slung between them. The garden had been\ncleared away and the pig-sties were finished, but there was still the\nmost arduous portion of the work to commence, which was the felling of\nthe trees to clear the land for the growing of corn. In this they could\nexpect no assistance from the garrison; indeed, from the indulgence of\nthe commandant, they had already obtained more than they could have\nexpected. It was in the last days of August, and the men lent from the\ngarrison were about to be recalled; the houses were completed, the\npalisade had been raised round the house and store-house, and the men\nwere now required at the fort. Captain Sinclair received several hints\nfrom the commandant that he must use all convenient dispatch, and limit\nhis absence to a few days more, which he trusted would be sufficient.\nCaptain Sinclair, who would willingly have remained in society which he\nso much valued, and who had now become almost one of the family, found\nthat he could make no more excuses. He reported that he would be ready\nto return on the 1st of September, and on the morning of that day the\n_bateaux_ arrived to take back the soldiers, and bring the pigs and\nfowls which had been promised. Mr. Campbell settled his account with\nCaptain Sinclair, by a draft upon his banker at Quebec, for the pay of\nthe soldiers, the cows, and the pigs. The Captain then took leave of his\nfriends with mutual regret, and many kind adieus, and, accompanied by\nthe whole of the family to the beach, embarked with all his men and\npulled away for the fort.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nThe Campbells remained for some time on the shore of the lake watching\nthe receding _bateaux_ until they turned round the point and were hidden\nfrom their sight, and then they walked back to the house. But few words\nwere exchanged as they returned, for they felt a sensation of loneliness\nfrom having parted with so many of their own countrymen; not that they\nwere, with the exception of Captain Sinclair, companions, but that,\naccustomed to the sight of the soldiers at their labor, the spot now\nappeared depopulated by their departure. Martin, too, and John, were\nboth absent; the latter had been two days away, and Martin, who had not\nyet found time to ascertain where old Malachi Bone had fixed his new\nabode, had gone out in search of it, and to mention to him Mr.\nCampbell's wishes as to John's visits to him, which were becoming more\nfrequent and more lengthened than Mr. Campbell wished them to be.\n\nWhen they entered the house, they all sat down, and Mr. Campbell then\nfirst spoke.\n\n\"Well, my dearest wife, here we are at last, left to ourselves and to\nour own resources. I am not at all doubtful of our doing well, if we\nexert ourselves, as it is our duty to do. I grant that we may have\nhardship to combat, difficulties to overcome, occasional disappointments\nand losses to bear up against; but let us recollect how greatly we have,\nthrough Providence, been already assisted and encouraged, how much help\nwe have received, and how much kindness we have experienced. Surely we\nought to feel most grateful to Heaven for blessings already vouchsafed\nto us, and ought to have a firm and lively faith in _Him_, who has\nhitherto so kindly watched over us. Let us not then repine or feel\ndispirited, but with grateful hearts do our duty cheerfully in that\nstate of life to which it has pleased _Him_ to call us.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, my dear husband,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"nay, I can\nsay with sincerity, that I am not sorry we are now left to our own\nexertions, and that we have an opportunity of proving that we _can_ do\nwithout the assistance of others. Up to the present, our trial has been\nnothing; indeed, I can not fancy to myself what our trials are to be.\nCome they may, but from what quarter I can not form an idea: should they\ncome, however, I trust we shall show our gratitude for the past\nblessings, and our faith derived from past deliverances, by a devout\nsubmission to whatever the Almighty may please to try or chasten us\nwith.\"\n\n\"Right, my dear,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"we will hope for the best; we\nare as much under his protection here in the wilderness, as we were at\nWexton Park; we were just as liable to all the ills which flesh is heir\nto when we were living in opulence and luxury as we are now in this\nlog-house; but we are, I thank God, not so liable in our present\nposition to forget Him, who so bountifully provides for us and in His\nwisdom ordereth all our ways. Most truly has the poet said--\n\n                  \"'Sweet are the uses of adversity!'\"\n\n\"Well,\" observed Emma, after a pause, as if to give a more lively turn\nto the conversation. \"I wonder what _my_ trials are to be! Depend upon\nit, the cow will kick down the pail, or the butter won't come!\"\n\n\"Or you'll get chapped fingers in the winter-time, and chilblains on\nyour feet,\" continued Mary.\n\n\"That will be bad; but Captain Sinclair says that if we don't take care\nwe shall be frost-bitten and lose the tips of our noses.\"\n\n\"That would be hard upon you, Emma, for you've none to spare,\" said\nAlfred.\n\n\"Well, you have, Alfred, so yours ought to go first.\"\n\n\"We must look after one another's noses, they say, as we can not tell if\nour own is in danger; and if we see a white spot upon another's nose, we\nmust take a bit of snow and rub it well; a little delicate attention\npeculiar to this climate.\"\n\n\"I can not say that I do not know what my trials are to be,\" said\nAlfred--\"that is, trials certain; nor can Henry either. When I look at\nthe enormous trunks of these trees, which we have to cut down with our\naxes, I feel positive that it will be a hard trial before we master\nthem. Don't you think so, Harry?\"\n\n\"I have made up my mind to have at least two new skins upon my hands\nbefore the winter comes on,\" replied Henry; \"but felling timber was not\na part of my university education--\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Alfred; \"Oxford don't teach that; now, my university\neducation--\"\n\n\"Your university education!\" cried Emma.\n\n\"Yes, mine; I have sailed all over the universe, and that I call a\nuniversity education; but here come Martin and John. Why, John has got a\ngun on his shoulder! He must have taken it with him when he last\ndisappeared.\"\n\n\"I suppose that by this time he knows how to use it, Alfred,\" said Mrs.\nCampbell.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Martin, who had entered; \"he knows well how to use\nand how to take care of it and take care of himself. I let him bring it\nhome on purpose to watch him. He has fired and loaded twice as we came\nback, and has killed this woodchuck,\" continued Martin, throwing the\ndead animal on the floor. \"Old Malachi has taught him well, and he has\nnot forgotten his lessons.\"\n\n\"What animal is that, Martin,--is it good to eat?\" said Henry.\n\n\"Not very good, sir; it's an animal that burrows in the ground, and is\nvery hurtful in a garden or to the young maize, and we always shoot them\nwhen we meet with them.\"\n\n\"It's a pity that it's not good to eat.\"\n\n\"Oh! you may eat it, sir; I don't say it's not fit to eat; but there are\nother things much better.\"\n\n\"That's quite sufficient for me, Martin,\" said Emma, \"I shall not taste\nhim; at all events, not this time, whatever I may have to do by and by.\"\n\n\"I spoke to old Bone, sir, and he says it's all right; that he won't\nkeep him more than a day without first sending him to you to ask leave.\"\n\n\"That's all I require, Martin.\"\n\n\"They have been out these two days, and had only just come home when I\narrived there. The game was still in the wood.\"\n\n\"I shot a deer,\" said John.\n\n\"You shot a deer, John!\" said Alfred; \"why what a useful fellow you will\nbe by and by.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; old Malachi told me that the boy had shot a deer, and that he\nwould bring it here to-morrow himself.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, for I wish to speak with him,\" said Mr. Campbell;\n\"but, John, how came you to take the rifle with you without leave?\"\n\nJohn made no answer.\n\n\"Answer me, John.\"\n\n\"Can't shoot without a gun,\" replied John.\n\n\"No, you can not; but the rifle is not yours.\"\n\n\"Give it to me, and I'll shoot every thing for dinner,\" replied John.\n\n\"I think you had better do so, father,\" said Henry in a low voice; \"the\ntemptation will be too strong.\"\n\n\"You are right, Henry,\" replied Mr. Campbell, aside. \"Now, John, I will\ngive you the rifle, if you will promise me to ask leave when you want to\ngo, and always come back at the time you have promised.\"\n\n\"I'll always tell when I go, if mamma will always let me go, and I'll\nalways come back when I promise, if--\"\n\n\"If what?\"\n\n\"If I've killed,\" replied John.\n\n\"He means, sir, that if he is on the track when his leave is out, that\nhe must follow it; but as soon as he has either lost his game, or killed\nit, he will then come home. That's the feeling of a true hunter, sir,\nand you must not balk it.\"\n\n\"Very true; well then, John, recollect that you promise.\"\n\n\"Martin,\" said Percival, \"when are you to teach me to fire the rifle?\"\n\n\"Oh, very soon now, sir; but the soldiers are gone, and as soon as you\ncan hit the mark, you shall go out with Mr. Alfred or me.\"\n\n\"And when are we to learn, Mary?\" said Emma.\n\n\"I will teach you, cousins,\" said Alfred, \"and give a lesson to my\nhonored mother.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll all learn,\" replied Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"What's to be done to-morrow, Martin?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Why, sir, there are boards enough to make a fishing-punt, and if you\nand Mr. Henry will help me, I think we shall have one made in two or\nthree days. The lake is full of fish, and it's a pity not to have some\nwhile the weather is so fine.\"\n\n\"I've plenty of lines in the store-room,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Master Percival would soon learn to fish by himself,\" said Martin, \"and\nthen he'll bring as much as Master John.\"\n\n\"Fish!\" said John with disdain.\n\n\"Yes, fish, Master John,\" replied Martin; \"a good hunter is always a\ngood fisherman, and don't despise them, for they often give him a meal\nwhen he would otherwise go to sleep with an empty stomach.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll catch fish with pleasure,\" cried Percival, \"only I must\nsometimes go out hunting.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear boy, and we must sometimes go to bed; and I think it is\nhigh time now, as we must all be up to-morrow at daylight.\"\n\nThe next morning, Mary and Emma set off to milk the cows--not, as usual,\nattended by some of the young men, for Henry and Alfred were busy, and\nCaptain Sinclair was gone. As they crossed the bridge, Mary observed to\nher sister,\n\n\"No more gentlemen to attend us lady milk-maids, Emma.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Emma; \"our avocation is losing all its charms, and a\npleasure now almost settles down to a duty.\"\n\n\"Alfred and Henry are with Martin about the fishing-boat,\" observed\nMary.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Emma; \"but I fancy, Mary, you were thinking more of\nCaptain Sinclair than of your cousins.\"\n\n\"That is very true, Emma; I was thinking of him,\" replied Mary, gravely.\n\"You don't know how I feel his absence.\"\n\n\"I can imagine it, though, my dearest Mary. Shall we soon see him\nagain?\"\n\n\"I do not know; but I think not for three or four weeks, for certain.\nAll that can be spared from the fort are gone haymaking, and if he is\none of the officers sent with the men, of course he will be absent, and\nif he is left in the fort, he will be obliged to remain there; so there\nis no chance of seeing him until the haymaking is over.\"\n\n\"Where is it that they go to make hay, Mary?\"\n\n\"You know they have only a sufficiency of pasture round the fort for the\ncattle during the summer, so they go along by the borders of the lake\nand islands, where they know there are patches of clear land, cut the\ngrass down, make the hay, and collect it all in the _bateaux_, and carry\nit to the fort to be stacked for the winter. This prairie was their best\nhelp, but now they have lost it.\"\n\n\"But Colonel Forster has promised papa sufficient hay for the cows for\nthis winter; indeed, we could not have fed them unless he had done so.\nDepend upon it, Captain Sinclair will bring the hay round, and then we\nshall see him again, Mary; but we must walk after our own cows now. No\none to drive them for us. If Alfred had any manners he might have come.\"\n\n\"And why not Henry, Emma?\" said Mary, with a smile.\n\n\"Oh! I don't know; Alfred came into my thoughts first.\"\n\n\"I believe that really was the case,\" replied Mary. \"Now I'm even with\nyou; so go along and milk your cows.\"\n\n\"It's all very well, miss,\" replied Emma, laughing; \"but wait till I\nhave learned to fire my rifle, and then you'll be more cautious of what\nyou say.\"\n\nOn their return home, they found the old hunter with a fine buck lying\nbefore him. Mr. Campbell was out with the boys and Martin, who wished\nhis opinion as to the size of the punt.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Bone?\" said Mary. \"Did John shoot that deer?\"\n\n\"Yes; and shot it as well as an old hunter, and the creatur' can hardly\nlift the gun to his shoulder. Which of you is named Mary?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Then I've something for you,\" said old Malachi, pulling from out of his\nvest a small parcel, wrapped up in thin bark, and handing it to her;\n\"it's a present from the Strawberry.\"\n\nMary opened the bark, and found inside of it a pair of moccasins, very\nprettily worked in stained porcupines' quills.\n\n\"Oh! how beautiful, and how kind of her! Tell her that I thank her, and\nlove her very much. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes; I'll tell her. Where's the boy?\"\n\n\"Who, John? I think he's gone up the stream to take some trout; he'll be\nback to breakfast, and that's just ready. Come, Emma, we must go in with\nthe milk.\"\n\nMr. Campbell and those who were with him soon returned.\n\nMalachi Bone then stated that he had brought the buck killed by John;\nand that, if it suited, he would carry back with him a keg of gunpowder\nand some lead; that he wished Mr. Campbell to calculate what he\nconsidered due to him for the property, and let him take it out in\ngoods, as he required them.\n\n\"Why don't you name your own price, Malachi?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"How can I name a price? It was given to me and cost nothing. I leave it\nall to you and Martin Super, as I said before.\"\n\n\"You show great confidence in me, I must say. Well Bone, I will not\ncheat you; but I am afraid you will be a long while before you are paid,\nif you only take it out in goods from my store-house.\"\n\n\"All the better, master; they will last till I die, and then what's left\nwill do for the boy here,\" replied the old hunter, putting his hand upon\nJohn's head.\n\n\"Bone,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"I have no objection to the boy going with\nyou occasionally; but I cannot permit him to be away always. I want him\nto come home the day after he has been to see you.\"\n\n\"Well, that's not reasonable, master. We go out after the game; who\nknows where we may find it, how long we may look for it, and how far it\nmay lead us? Must we give up the chase when close upon it, because\ntime's up? That'll never do. I want to make the boy a hunter, and he\nmust learn to sleep out and do every thing else as concerns a hunter to\ndo. You must let him be with me longer, and, if you please, when he\ncomes back keep him longer; but if you wish him to be a man, the more he\nstays with me the better. He shall know all the Indian craft, I promise\nyou, and the winter after this he shall take beavers and bring you the\nskins.\"\n\n\"I think, sir,\" observed Martin, \"it's all in reason what the old man\nsays.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" said Alfred; \"after all, it's only sending John to\nschool. Let him go, father, and have him home for the holidays.\"\n\n\"I'll always come to you, when I can,\" said John.\n\n\"I am more satisfied at John's saying that than you might imagine,\" said\nMrs. Campbell; \"John is an honest boy, and does not say what he does not\nmean.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, if you have no objection, I'm sure I will not raise any\nmore.\"\n\n\"I think I shall gain more by John's affection than by compulsion, my\ndear husband. He says he will always come when he can, and I believe\nhim; I have, therefore, no objection to let him stay with Malachi Bone,\nat all events for a week or so at a time.\"\n\n\"But his education, my dear.\"\n\n\"He is certain to learn nothing now that this fever for the woods, if I\nmay so call it, is upon him. He will, perhaps, be more teachable a year\nor two hence. You must be aware that we have no common disposition to\ndeal with in that child; and however my maternal feelings may oppose my\njudgment, it is still strong enough to make me feel that my decision is\nfor his benefit. We must not here put the value upon a _finished_\neducation which we used to do. Let us give him every advantage which the\npeculiarity of his position will allow us to do; but we are now in the\nwoods, to a certain degree returned to a state of nature, and the first\nand most important knowledge, is to learn to gain our livelihoods.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I think you are correct in your views on the subject,\nand therefore, John, you may go to school with Malachi Bone; come to see\nus when you can, and I expect you to turn out the Nimrod of the west.\"\n\nOld Malachi stared at the conclusion of this speech; Alfred observed his\nsurprise, and burst into a fit of laughter. He then said, \"The English\nof all that is, Malachi, that my brother John has my father's leave to\ngo with you, and you're to make a man of him.\"\n\n\"He who made him must make a man of him,\" replied Bone: \"I can only make\nhim a good hunter, and that I will, if he and I are spared. Now, master,\nif Martin will give me the powder and lead, I'll be off again. Is the\nboy to go?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you desire it,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"come, John, and wish me\ngood-by and remember your promise.\"\n\nJohn bade farewell to the whole party with all due decorum, and then\ntrotted off after his schoolmaster.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nIn the course of a week or two, things found their places, and the\nfamily began to feel more comfortable; there was also a degree of\nregularity and order established, which could not be effected during the\ntime that the soldiers were employed. Mrs. Campbell and Percival took\nupon them all the work inside and round the house during the morning;\nthe latter attending to the pigs and fowls, bringing water from the\nstream, etc. Mary and Emma milked the cows, and then assisted their\nmother during the day in washing, etc. Mr. Campbell instructed Percival,\nworked in the garden, and assisted as much as he could, where he might\nbe found most useful; but he was too advanced in years to be capable of\nmuch hard work. Alfred, Henry and Martin Super were employed during the\nwhole day, clearing the ground and felling the timber; but every other\nday, one or the other went out with Martin into the woods to procure\nfood, bringing home with them deer, wild turkeys, or other game, which\nwith an occasional piece of salt-pork, and the fish caught, were\nsufficient for the family consumption. Percival was now permitted to\naccompany the hunting-parties, and became somewhat expert with his\nrifle. He required only a little more practice to be a good shot.\n\nThey rose at half-past five,--were all assembled to prayers at half-past\nseven, previous to going to breakfast. They dined at one, and had a\ncombined tea and supper at seven o'clock. At nine o'clock they went to\nbed. Before two months had passed away, every thing went on like\nclock-work. One day passed away so like another, that the time flew\nimperceptibly, and they wondered that the Sundays came round so quick.\nThey had now time to unpack every thing, and the books which Mrs.\nCampbell had selected and brought with her had been arranged on shelves\nin the parlor; but they had not as yet much time to read, and were\ngenerally too tired before the day was over not to long for their beds.\nIndeed, the only interval of leisure during the whole day was between\nsupper and bedtime, when they would all assemble in the kitchen and talk\nover the little matters which had occurred either during the chase or at\nhome. But they were now in the middle of October, the winter was fast\napproaching, and they looked forward to it with some degree of anxiety.\n\nJohn had kept his word very sacredly. He was occasionally absent for\nthree or four days, but if so, he invariably came to the house and\nremained a day or two at home. Alfred and Martin had long finished the\nfishing-punt, and as it was light and easily handled, Henry and Percival\nwent out in it together, and when he was at home, John with Percival\nwould pull half a mile out into the lake, and soon return with a supply\nof large fish. Mrs. Campbell, therefore, had salted down sufficient to\nfill a barrel for the winter's use.\n\nOne day they were agreeably surprised by Captain Sinclair making his\nappearance. He had walked from the fort, to communicate to them that the\nhay had been gathered in, and would be sent round in a day or two, and\nalso to inform Mr. Campbell that the commandant could spare them a young\nbullock, if he would wish to have it for winter provision. This offer\nwas gladly accepted, and, having partaken of their dinner, Captain\nSinclair was obliged to return to the fort, he being that night on duty.\nPrevious, however, to his return, he had some conversation with Martin\nSuper, unobserved by the rest of the party. Afterward he invited Alfred\nto walk back to the fort with him and return on the following morning.\nAlfred agreed to do so; and two hours before it was dark they set off,\nand as soon as they were on the opposite side of the brook they were\njoined by Martin Super.\n\n\"My reasons for asking you to come back with me were twofold,\" said\nCaptain Sinclair to Alfred. \"In the first place, I wish you to know the\nroad to the fort, in case it should be necessary to make any\ncommunication during the winter; secondly, I wished to have some\nconversation with you and Martin relative to information we have\nreceived about the Indians. I can tell you privately what I was\nunwilling to say before your mother and cousins, as it would put them in\na state of restlessness and anxiety, which could avail nothing and only\nannoy them. The fact is, we have for some time had information that the\nIndians have held several councils. It does not appear, however, that\nthey have as yet decided upon any thing, although it is certain that\nthey have gathered together in large numbers not very far from the fort.\nNo doubt but they have French emissaries inciting them to attack us.\nFrom what we can learn, however, they have not agreed among themselves,\nand, therefore, in all probability, nothing will be attempted until next\nyear, for the autumn is their season for sending out their war-parties.\nAt the same time, there is no security, for there is a great difference\nbetween a junction of all the tribes against us and a common Indian\nwar-party. We must, therefore, be on the alert, for we have a\ntreacherous foe to deal with. And now, for your portion of interest in\nthis affair. If they attack the fort, which they may do, notwithstanding\nour treaties with them, you of course would not be safe where you are;\nbut, unfortunately, you may not be safe even if we are not molested; for\nwhen the Indians collect (even though the main body decide upon\nnothing), there are always bands of five to ten Indians, who, having\nleft their homes, will not return if they can help it without some\nbooty; these are not regular warriors, or if warriors, not much esteemed\nby the tribe; in fact, they are the worst classes of Indians, who are\nmere robbers and banditti. You must, therefore, be on the look-out for\nthe visits of these people. It is fortunate for you that old Bone has\nshifted his abode so many miles to the westward, and that you are on\nsuch good terms with him, as it is not very likely that any party of\nIndians can approach you without his meeting with them or their track\nduring his excursions.\"\n\n\"That's true, Captain,\" observed Martin, \"and I will go myself and put\nhim on his guard.\"\n\n\"But, will they not attack him before they attack us?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Why should they?\" replied Sinclair. \"He is as much an Indian almost as\nthey are, and is well known to most of them. Besides, what would they\ngain by attacking him? These straggling parties, which you have to fear,\nare in quest of booty, and will not expect to find any thing in his\nwigwam except a few furs. No; they will not venture near his rifle,\nwhich they fear, when there is nothing to be obtained by so doing. I\nmention this to you, Alfred, that you may be prepared and keep a sharp\nlook-out. It is very possible that nothing of the kind may occur, and\nthat the winter may pass away without any danger, and I mention it to\nyou and Martin, as I consider that the probabilities are not sufficient\nto warrant your alarming the other members of the family, especially the\nfemale portion of it. How far you may consider it advisable to\ncommunicate what has now passed to your father and Henry, it is for you\nto decide. As I said before, I do not imagine you have much to fear from\na general attack; it is too late in the year, and we know that the\ncouncils broke up without coming to any decision. You have only to fear\nthe attempts of small parties of marauders, and I think you are quite\nstrong enough, both in numbers and in the defenses of your habitation,\nto resist them successfully, if you are not suddenly surprised. That is\nall that you have to fear; and now that you are warned, half the danger\nis over.\"\n\n\"Well, Captain, I'll leave you now,\" said Martin, \"I shall go over to\nold Malachi's to-night; for it occurs to me that any attack is more\nlikely to be made between the fall of the leaf and the fall of the snow\nthan afterward; so the sooner I put Malachi on his guard the better.\nGood-evening, sir.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair and Alfred continued on their way to the fort. They had\ncontracted a strong friendship, and were unreserved in their\ncommunication with each other.\n\n\"You have no idea, Alfred,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"how the peculiar\nposition of your family occupies my thoughts. It really appears almost\nlike madness on the part of your father to bring out your mother and\ncousins to such a place, and expose them to such privations and dangers.\nI can hardly sleep at night when I reflect upon what might happen.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" replied Alfred, \"that if my father had known exactly what\nhis present position would have been, he would have decided upon not\nleaving England; but you must remember that he came out with much\nencouragement, and the idea that he would only have to surmount the\nhardships of a settler in clearing his land. He fancied, at least I'm\nsure _we_ all did, that we should be surrounded by other farmers, and\nhave no particular danger to incur. When at Quebec, he found that all\nthe good land near to civilization was bought up or possessed by the\nFrench Canadians; he was advised to come further westward by those who\nought to have been aware of what he would have to encounter by so doing,\nbut who probably considered that the danger we now apprehend no longer\nexisted; and he has followed that advice which I have no doubt was\nconscientiously given. I think myself, even now, that the advice was\ngood, although we are accompanied by females who have been brought up in\nso different a sphere, and for whose welfare such anxiety is shown; for\nobserve now, Sinclair, suppose, without having made our acquaintance,\nyou had heard that some settlers, men and women, had located themselves\nwhere we have done; should you have considered it so very rash an\nundertaking, presuming that they were merely farmers and farmers'\nwives?\"\n\n\"I certainly should have troubled myself very little about them, and\nperhaps not thought upon the subject.\"\n\n\"But supposing the subject had been brought up at the fort, and you had\nheard the parties had a stockaded house and four or five good rifles to\ndepend upon, with the fort to fall back upon if necessary?\"\n\n\"I admit that I should most probably have said that they were in a\nposition to protect themselves.\"\n\n\"Most assuredly, and therefore we are equally so; your feelings of\ninterest in us magnify the danger, and I therefore trust that in future\nyou will not allow our position to interfere with your night's rest.\"\n\n\"I wish I could bring myself to that feeling of security, Alfred. If I\nwere only with you, to assist in protecting them, I should sleep sound\nenough.\"\n\n\"Then you would not be of much use as a watch,\" replied Alfred,\nlaughing. \"Never fear, Sinclair, we shall do well enough,\" continued he,\n\"and if we require assistance, we will apply for you and a party of\nsoldiers.\"\n\n\"There would be much difficulty about that, Alfred,\" replied Captain\nSinclair; \"if there were sufficient danger to make that demand upon the\ncommandant, the same danger would require that he should not weaken his\nforce in the fort; no, you would have to retreat to the fort, and leave\nyour farm to the mercy of the Indians.\"\n\n\"It certainly would be the wisest plan of the two,\" replied Alfred; \"at\nall events, we could send the women. But the Indians have not come yet,\nand we must hope that they will not.\"\n\nThe conversation was then changed, and in half an hour more they arrived\nat the fort.\n\nAlfred was welcomed at the fort by Colonel Forster, with whom he was a\ngreat favorite. The Colonel could not refrain from expressing his\nopinion, that Mr. Campbell and his family were in a position of some\ndanger, and lamenting that the female portion of the family, who had\nbeen brought up with such very different prospects, should be so\nsituated. He even ventured to hint that if Mrs. Campbell and the two\nMisses Percival would pass the winter in the fort he would make\narrangements to accommodate them. But Alfred at once replied, that he\nwas convinced no inducement would persuade his mother or cousins to\nleave his father; they had shared his prosperity, and they would cling\nto him in adversity; that they all were aware of what they would have to\nrisk before they came out, and his father preferred a life of honorable\nindependence attended with danger, to seeking the assistance of others.\n\n\"But still I can not perceive any reason for the ladies remaining to\nencounter the danger.\"\n\n\"The more we are, the stronger we are to repel danger,\" replied Alfred.\n\n\"But women surely will only be an incumbrance!\"\n\n\"I think differently,\" replied Alfred. \"Young and delicate as my cousins\nare, they will not shrink any more than my mother when their services\nare required. They now can all of them use a rifle, if required, and to\ndefend a house, a determined woman is almost as effective as a man.\nDepend upon it, if it comes to the necessity, they will do so. You see,\ntherefore, Colonel, that by taking away our ladies, you will weaken our\nforce,\" continued Alfred, laughing.\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow, I will press it no more. Only recollect that I\nshall always be ready to send you any assistance when required.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking, Colonel Forster, that, as we have no horses at\npresent, if you have any rockets, they might be useful in such a case.\nAt the distance we are from you a rocket would be seen immediately if\nfired at night, and I promise you, that it shall not be fired without\ngreat necessity.\"\n\n\"I am glad that you have mentioned it, Alfred; you shall have a dozen to\ntake with you. You go back with the boats that carry the hay to-morrow\nmorning, do you not.\"\n\n\"Yes; I shall take that opportunity, to save wearing out my shoes, as we\nhave no cobbler near to us. I presume it will be the last trip made by\nthe boats this season?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Colonel, \"the frost will soon set in now. In another\nfortnight we shall probably be visited with a heavy fall of snow, and\nthe ground will then be covered till spring. But I suppose we shall see\nor hear from you occasionally?\"\n\n\"Yes; as soon as I can push along in my snow-shoes, I will pay you a\nvisit,\" replied Alfred, \"but I have that art to learn yet.\"\n\nThe following morning the sky was clear and the day brilliant. The sun\nshone upon the dark, scarlet-tinged foliage of the oaks, and through the\ntransparent yellow leaves of the maple. A slight frost had appeared for\ntwo or three mornings about a month back, and now they were enjoying\nwhat was termed the Indian summer, which is a return of fair and rather\nwarm weather for a short time previous to the winter setting in.\n\nThe soldiers were busy carrying the hay down to the _bateaux_, and,\nbefore noon, Alfred bade farewell to Colonel Forster and the other\nofficers of the fort, and, accompanied by Captain Sinclair, went down to\nembark. All was ready, and Alfred stepped into the boat; Captain\nSinclair being on duty and not able to accompany him back.\n\n\"I shall not fail to give directions to the sentries about the rockets,\nAlfred,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"and so tell your mother and cousins;\nand mind to show them how to fire them off from out of the barrel of a\nmusket. Good-by; God bless you, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" replied Alfred, as the boats pulled from the shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nAfter Alfred's return from the fort, a few days passed away without any\nincident: Martin had paid a visit to Malachi Bone, who had promised that\nhe would be on the look-out and would give immediate information and\nassistance in case of any hostile measures on the part of the Indians.\nHe told Martin, that in a few days he would discover what had taken\nplace and what might be looked forward to. When Martin returned with his\ncommunication, Alfred was satisfied, and did not acquaint any body\nexcept his brother Henry with the information which he had received from\nCaptain Sinclair.\n\nThe monotony of their life was, however, broken in upon by the arrival\nof a corporal from the fort, who was the bearer of the first dispatches\nwhich they had received since their arrival at the settlement. Letters,\nyes letters, not only from Quebec but from England, were announced. The\nwhole house was in confusion, all crowding round Mr. Campbell while he\nunsealed the large packet. First a bundle of English newspapers from the\nGovernor of Quebec--these were laid aside; a letter from Mr. Campbell's\nagent at Quebec--this was on business and could wait his leisure; then\nthe letters from England--two long, well-filled double letters from Miss\nPaterson to Mary and Emma; another from Mr. Campbell's agent in England,\nand a large one on foolscap with \"On His Majesty's Service,\" directed to\nMr. Alfred Campbell. Each party seized upon their letters, and hastened\non one side with them. Mrs. Campbell being the only one who had no\ncorrespondent, anxiously watched the countenance of Alfred, who, after a\nhasty glance, cried out, \"I am confirmed to my rank, my dear mother; I\nam a lieutenant in his Majesty's service--huzza! Here's a letter\ninclosed from Captain Lumley; I know his handwriting.\" Alfred received\nthe congratulations of the whole party, handed the official letter to\nhis mother, and then commenced the perusal of the one from Captain\nLumley. After a short silence, during which they were all occupied with\ntheir correspondence, Mr. Campbell said, \"I also have good news to\ncommunicate to you; Mr. H. writes to me to say, that Mr. Douglas\nCampbell, on finding the green-houses and hot-houses so well stocked,\nconsidered that he was bound to pay for the plants; that they have been\nvalued at seven hundred pounds, and that he has paid that money into my\nagent's hands. This is extremely liberal of Mr. Douglas Campbell, and I\ncertainly did not expect, as I found plants there on my taking\npossession, that I was entitled to any remuneration for what I left.\nHowever, I am too poor to refuse his offer from any feelings of\ndelicacy, and shall therefore write and thank him for his generous\nbehavior.\" Alfred had read the letter from Captain Lumley, which made\nhim very thoughtful. The fact was, his promotion and the observations in\nCaptain Lumley's letter had brought back all his former regret at having\nquitted the service, and he was very melancholy in consequence; but as\nhis cousins read their letters aloud, he gradually recovered his\nspirits.\n\nAt last, all the letters were read, and then the newspapers were\ndistributed. No more work was done that day, and in the evening they all\nsat round the kitchen fire and talked over the intelligence they had\nreceived until long after their usual time of retiring to bed.\n\n\"I have been thinking, my dear Emily,\" said Mr. Campbell, the next\nmorning before they quitted their sleeping-room, \"what a very seasonable\nsupply of money this will be. My funds, as you have seen by the account\nof my Quebec agent, were nearly exhausted, and we have many things yet\nto procure. We shall require horses next year, and we must increase our\nstock in every way; indeed, if we could have another man or two, it\nwould be very advantageous, as the sooner we clear the ground, the\nsooner we shall be independent.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Campbell; besides, we shall now have Alfred's\nhalf-pay, poor fellow, which will help us very much; I have been\nthinking more of him than any thing else this night; I watched him when\nhe read Captain Lumley's letter, and I well understood the cause of his\nseriousness for some time afterward; I almost feel inclined to let him\nreturn to his profession; it would be painful parting with him, but the\nsacrifice on his part is very great.\"\n\n\"Still it's his duty,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"and, moreover, absolutely\nnecessary at present, that he should remain with us. When we are more\nsettled and more independent of his assistance we will talk over the\nsubject.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Mary and Emma had gone out as usual to milk the cows.\nIt was a beautiful clear day, but there was a bracing air which cheered\nthe spirits, and the sunshine was pleasantly warm in situations\nsheltered from the winds; one of the few fine days just before the\nrushing in of winter. They had milked their cows, and had just turned\nthem out again, when they both sat down with their pails before them on\na log, which was in front of Malachi's lodge, now used as a cow-house.\n\n\"Do you know, Mary,\" said Emma, after a pause, \"I'm almost sorry that I\nhave received a letter from Miss Paterson.\"\n\n\"Indeed, dear Emma!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed it has unsettled me. I did nothing but dream all last\nnight. Every thing was recalled to my mind--all that I most wished to\nforget. I fancied myself again engaged in all the pursuits of our\nmuch-loved home; I was playing the harp, you were accompanying me on the\npiano as usual; we walked out in the shrubberies; we took an airing in\nthe carriage; all the servants were before me; we went to the villages\nand to the almshouses; we were in the garden picking dahlias and roses;\nI was just going up to dress for a very large dinner-party, and had rung\nthe bell for Simpson, when I woke up, and found myself in a log-hut,\nwith my eyes fixed upon the rafters and bark covering of the roof,\nthousands of miles from Wexton Hall, and half an hour longer in bed than\na dairy-maid should be.\"\n\n\"I will confess, my dear Emma, that I passed much such a night; old\nassociations will rise up again when so forcibly brought to our\nremembrance as they have been by Miss Paterson's letters, but I strove\nall I could to banish them from my mind, and not indulge in useless\nrepining.\"\n\n\"Repine, I do not, Mary, at least, I hope not, but one can not well help\nregretting; I can not help remembering, as Macduff says, that 'such\nthings were.'\"\n\n\"He might well say so, Emma; for what had he lost? his wife and all his\nchildren, ruthlessly murdered; but what have we lost in comparison?\nnothing--a few luxuries. Have we not health and spirits? Have we not our\nkind uncle and aunt, who have fostered us--our cousins so attached to\nus? Had it not been for the kindness of our uncle and aunt, who have\nbrought us up as their own children, should we, poor orphans, have ever\nbeen partakers of those luxuries which you now regret? Ought we not\nrather to thank Heaven that circumstances have enabled us to show some\ngratitude for benefits heaped upon us? How much greater are these\nprivations to my uncle and aunt now that they are so much more advanced\nin years, and have been so much longer accustomed to competence and\nease; and shall we repine or even regret, unless it is on their account?\nSurely, my dear Emma, not on our own.\"\n\n\"I feel the truth of all you say, Mary,\" replied Emma; \"nay, all that\nyou have now said passed in my own mind, and I have argued to myself in\nalmost the same words, but I fear that I am not quite so much of a\nphilosopher as you are; and, acknowledging that what you say is correct,\nI still have the same feeling--that is, I wish that I had not received\nthe letter from Miss Paterson.\"\n\n\"In that wish there can be no harm, for it is only wishing that you may\nnot be tempted to repine.\"\n\n\"Exactly, my dear Mary; I am a daughter of Eve,\" replied Emma, laughing,\nand rising from her seat; \"I will put away Miss Paterson's letter, and I\ndare say in a day or two I shall have forgotten all about it. Dear\nAlfred, how glad I am that he is promoted; I shall call him Lieutenant\nCampbell till he is sick of it. Come, Mary, or we shall be keeping my\nuncle waiting; come, Juno.\"\n\nEmma's calling Juno to follow her, reminds me that I have not yet\nintroduced the dogs to my little readers, and as they will have to play\ntheir parts in our history, I may as well do so at once. Captain\nSinclair, it may be remembered, had procured five dogs for Mr. Campbell\nfrom the officers of the fort,--two terriers, which were named Trim and\nSnob; Trim was a small dog and kept in the house, but Snob was a very\npowerful bull-terrier, and very savage; a fox-hound bitch, the one which\nEmma had just called Juno; Bully, a very fine young bull-dog, and\nSancho, an old pointer. At night, these dogs were tied up: Juno in the\nstore-house; Bully and Snob at the door of the house within the\npalisade; Trim in doors, and old Sancho at the lodge of Malachi Bone,\nwhere the cows were put in at night. Mr. Campbell found it rather\nexpensive at first feeding these dogs, but as soon as Martin and his\ncompanions brought home game, there was always plenty for them all. They\nwere all very sharp and high-couraged dogs, for they had been born in\nthe fort and had been brought up to hunting every kind of game\nindiscriminately; and I need hardly add that they were excellent\nwatch-dogs, and considered by Mr. Campbell as a great protection. For\nthe next two days, the family remained rather unsettled; there was so\nmuch news in the newspapers; so many recollections brought up by their\nperusal; so much to talk about and discuss, that very little work was\ndone. The weather, however, was now becoming much colder, and, for the\nlast two days the sun had not shone. The sky was of one uniform, murky,\nsolemn gray; and every thing announced that the winter was close at\nhand. Martin, who had been hunting, when he came home bid them prepare\nfor an immediate change in the weather, and his prediction was speedily\nverified.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nIt was on the Saturday evening, when they had all assembled round the\nfire, for it was more cold than it had hitherto been, that the moaning\nof the wind among the trees of the forest announced a gale of wind from\nthe northward.\n\n\"We shall have it soon,\" observed Martin, \"winter mostly comes in with a\ngale.\"\n\n\"Yes; and this appears as if it would be a strong gale,\" replied Alfred.\n\"Hark! how the boughs of the trees are sawing and cracking against each\nother.\"\n\n\"I reckon we may get our snow-shoes out of the store-house, John,\" said\nMartin, \"and then we shall see how you can get over the ground with them\nwhen you go hunting. You have not shot a moose yet.\"\n\n\"Is the moose the same as the elk, Martin?\" said Henry.\n\n\"I do not think it is, sir; yet I've heard both names given to the\nanimal.\"\n\n\"Have you ever shot any?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; many a one. They're queer animals; they don't run like the\nother deer, but they trot as fast as the others run, so it comes to the\nsame thing. They are very shy, and difficult to get near, except in the\nheavy snow, and then their weight will not allow them to get over it, as\nthe lighter deer can; they sink up to their shoulders, and flounder\nabout till they are overtaken. You see, Master Percival, the moose can't\nput on snow-shoes like we can, and gives us the advantage over the\nanimal.\"\n\n\"Are they dangerous animals, Martin?\" inquired Mary Percival.\n\n\"Every large animal is more or less dangerous when it turns to bay,\nmiss. A moose's horns sometimes weigh fifty pounds, and it is a strong\nanimal to boot; but it can't do anything when the snow is deep. You'll\nfind it good eating, at all events, when we bring one in.\"\n\n\"I'll bring one,\" said John, who was cleaning his rifle.\n\n\"I dare say you will as soon as you can manage your snow-shoes,\" replied\nMartin. \"The wind is getting up higher. I guess you'll not find your way\nback to Malachi's lodge, Master John, as you thought to do to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\"It is certainly a dreadful night,\" observed Mrs. Campbell; \"and I feel\nthe cold very sensibly.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; but as soon as the snow is down, you'll be warmer.\"\n\n\"It is time to go to bed,\" observed Mr. Campbell, \"so put away your\nwork: and, Henry, give me down the Bible.\"\n\nDuring that night the gale increased to almost a hurricane; the trees of\nthe forest clashed and crackled, groaned and sawed their long arms\nagainst each other, creating an unusual and almost appalling noise; the\nwind howled round the palisades and fluttered the strips of bark on the\nroof, and as they all lay in bed, they could not sleep from the noise\noutside, and the increased feeling of cold. It was also the first trial\nof this new house in severe weather, and some of the wakeful party were\nanxiously watching the result. Toward the morning the storm abated, and\nevery thing was again quiet. In consequence of the restless night which\nthey had passed they were not so early as usual. Emma and Mary, when\nthey came out of their room, found Martin and Alfred up and very busy\nwith shovels; and, to their astonishment, they perceived that the snow\nwas at least three feet deep on the ground, and in some places had been\ndrifted up higher than their heads.\n\n\"Why, Alfred!\" cried Emma; \"how shall we be able to go after the cows\nthis morning? This is, indeed, winter come on with little warning.\"\n\n\"It still snows,\" observed Mary; \"not much, indeed, but the sky is very\nblack.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss; we shall have some more of it yet,\" observed Martin. \"Mr.\nCampbell and Henry have gone to the store-house for more shovels, for we\nmust work hard, and clear a footpath, and then get the snow up against\nthe palisades.\"\n\n\"What a sudden change,\" said Emma; \"I wish the sky would clear, and then\nI should not care.\"\n\n\"It will to-morrow, Miss Emma, I dare say; but the snow must come down\nfirst.\"\n\nMartin and Alfred had only time to clear a path to the store-house. Mr.\nCampbell and Henry returned with more shovels, and as soon as breakfast\nwas over, they commenced work. As for Mary and Emma going to milk the\ncows, that was impossible. Martin undertook that task until they had\ncleared a pathway to the hunter's lodge, in which the animals were shut\nup every night.\n\nBy the advice of Martin, the snow next the palisades was piled up\nagainst the palings like a wall, as high as they could reach or throw\nit, by which means they got rid of the snow about the house, and at the\nsame time formed a barrier against the freezing winds which they had to\nexpect. All worked hard; Percival and John were of great use, and even\nMrs. Campbell and the girls assisted collecting the remainder of the\nsnow, and clearing it off the window-sills and other parts. By noon the\nsnow left off falling, the sky cleared up, and the sun shone bright,\nalthough it gave out but little warmth.\n\nAfter dinner they renewed their labors, and commenced clearing away a\npath to the lodge, where the cows were locked in, and before nightfall\nthey had accomplished their task as far as the bridge over the stream,\nwhich was about half-way. It had been a day of great fatigue, and they\nwere glad to retire to rest. Mrs. Campbell and the girls had put an\nadditional supply of blankets and skins upon the beds, for the cold was\nnow intense, and the thermometer stood far below the freezing point.\n\nThe following morning they resumed their task; the sky was still\nunclouded, and the sun shone out clear and bright. By dinner-time the\npath to the cow house had been completed; and the men then employed\nthemselves in carrying as much fire-wood as they could, before it was\ndark, within the palisades.\n\n\"Well,\" observed Alfred, \"now things may go on as usual within doors;\nand what have we to do out, Martin?\"\n\n\"You must first get on your snow-shoes, and learn to walk in them,\"\nobserved Martin; \"or otherwise you'll be a prisoner as well as the\nladies. You see, John, you're not at Malachi's lodge.\"\n\n\"Go to-morrow,\" replied John.\n\n\"No; not to-morrow, for I must go with you,\" said Martin; \"I can not\ntrust you for finding your way; and I can not go to-morrow nor the next\nday either. We must kill our beef to-morrow; there's no fear but it will\nkeep all the winter now, and we shall save our hay.\"\n\n\"My larder is but poorly furnished,\" observed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Never mind, ma'am, we'll soon have something in it, which will save our\nbeef. In another week you shall have it well stocked.\"\n\n\"John,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"recollect you must not go away without\nMartin.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" replied John.\n\nAll the game in the larder having been consumed, they sat down to salt\npork and some of the fish which had been cured. The latter was\npronounced to be excellent.\n\n\"What is the name of this fish, Martin?\"\n\n\"It is called the white-fish,\" replied Martin, \"and I have heard gentry\nfrom the old country say that they have none better, if any so good.\"\n\n\"It is certainly most excellent,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"and we will not\nforget to have a good provision for next winter, if it please God to\nspare our lives.\"\n\n\"Where were you born, Martin?\" said Henry, as they were sitting round\nthe kitchen fire, as usual in the evening.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Henry, I was born at Quebec. My father was a corporal in the\narmy under General Wolfe, and was wounded in the great battle fought\nbetween him and the Frenchman Montcalm.\"\n\n\"In which both generals were killed, but the victory was to us.\"\n\n\"So I've heard, sir,\" replied Martin. \"My mother was an English woman,\nand I was born about four years after the surrender of Quebec. My mother\ndied soon afterward, but my father was alive about five years ago, I\nbelieve. I can't exactly say, as I was for three or four years in the\nemploy of the Fur Company, and when I returned, I found that he was\ndead.\"\n\n\"And you have been a hunter all your life?\"\n\n\"Not all my life, and not exactly a hunter. I call myself a trapper, but\nI still am both. I first was out with the Indians when I was about\nfourteen, for you see my father wanted to make me a drummer, and I could\nnot stand that; so I said to him, 'Father, I won't be a drummer.'\n'Well,' says he, 'Martin, you must help yourself, for all my interest\nlies in the army.' 'So I will,' says I; 'father, I'm off for the woods.'\n'Well,' says he, 'just as you like, Martin.' So one fine day I wished\nhim good-by, and did not see him again for more than two years.\"\n\n\"Well, and what took place then?\"\n\n\"Why, I brought home three or four packages of good skins, and sold them\nwell. Father was so pleased, that he talked of turning trapper himself,\nbut, as I told the old man, a man with a lame leg--for he had been\nwounded in the leg and halted--would not make his livelihood by hunting\nin the woods of Canada.\"\n\n\"Was your father still in the army?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, he was not in the army; but he was employed in the\nstorekeeper's department; they gave him the berth on account of his\nwound.\"\n\n\"Well, go on, Martin.\"\n\n\"I haven't much more to say, ma'am, I brought home my furs, sold them,\nand father helped me to spend the money as long as he was alive, and\nvery welcome he was to his share. I felt rather queer when I came back\nfrom the Fur Company and found that the old man was dead, for I had\nlooked forward with pleasure to the old man's welcome, and his enjoying\nhis frolic with me as usual.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid those frolics were not very wise, Martin.\"\n\n\"No, sir, they were very foolish, I believe; but I fear it will always\nbe the case with us trappers. We are like sailors, we do not know what\nto do with money when we get it; so we throw it away, and the sooner the\nbetter, for it is our enemy while we have it. I assure you, sir, that I\nused to feel quite happy when all my money was gone, and I was setting\noff to the woods again. It's a hard life, but a life that unfits you\nfor any other; a life which you become very fond of. I don't mind being\nhere with you by way of a change; indeed, as long as there is hunting,\nit is almost as good as if I were in the woods, but else I think I shall\ndie a trapper.\"\n\n\"But, Martin,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"how much more wise would it be to put\nyour money by, and after a time purchase a farm and settle down a steady\nman with property, perhaps married and the father of a family.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it might be; but if I do not like it so well as trapping, I\ndon't see why I should do so; it would be changing my life to please\nothers and not myself.\"\n\n\"That's very true, Martin,\" said Alfred, laughing.\n\n\"Perhaps Martin may change his mind before he is an old man,\" replied\nMrs. Campbell. \"Dear me! what noise was that?\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell,\nas a melancholy howl was heard without.\n\n\"Only a rascally wolf, ma'am,\" said Martin; \"we must expect the animals\nto be about us now that the snow has fallen, and the winter has set in.\"\n\n\"A wolf! are they not dangerous, Martin?\" inquired Mary Percival.\n\n\"That depends, miss, how hungry they may be; but they are not very fond\nof attacking a human being; if we had any sheep outside, I fancy that\nthey would stand a bad chance.\"\n\nThe howl was repeated, when one or two of the dogs which had been\nadmitted into the house and were stretched before the fire, roused up\nand growled.\n\n\"They hear him, ma'am, and if we were to let them out, would soon be at\nhim. No, no, John, sit still and put down your rifle; we can't afford to\nhurt wolves; their skins won't fetch a half-dollar, and their flesh is\nnot fit for a clog, let alone a Christian. Let the vermin howl till he\nis tired; he'll be off to the woods again before daylight.\"\n\n\"There is certainly something very melancholy and dreadful to me in that\nhowl,\" said Emma; \"it frightens me.\"\n\n\"What, Emma, afraid?\" said Alfred, going to her; \"why yes, really she\ntrembles; why, my dear Emma, do you recollect how frightened you and\nMary were at the noise of the frogs when you first came here; you got\nused to it very soon, and so you will to the howl of a wolf.\"\n\n\"There is some difference, Alfred,\" replied Emma, shuddering as the howl\nwas repeated. \"I don't know how it is,\" said she, rallying her spirits,\n\"but I believe it was reading Little Red Riding Hood when I was a child,\nwhich has given me such a horror of a wolf; I shall get over it very\nsoon, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"I must say, that it does not create the most agreeable sensation in my\nmind,\" observed Mrs. Campbell, \"but I was aware of what we were to\nencounter when we came here, and if it is only to be annoyed with the\ncry of a wild beast, we may consider that we get off very cheaply.\"\n\n\"I should feel much more at ease, if all the rifles were loaded,\" said\nMary Percival, in her usual quiet way.\n\n[LADY-MILKMAIDS.]\n\n\"And I too,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Well, then, if that will at all relieve your minds, it is easily done,\"\nsaid Mr. Campbell; \"let us all load our rifles, and put them back in\ntheir rests.\"\n\n\"Mine's loaded,\" said John.\n\n\"And the rest soon shall be,\" said Alfred, \"even the three appropriated\nfor your use, mother and cousins. Now don't you feel some satisfaction\nin knowing you can load and fire them yourselves? the practice you had\nduring the fine weather has not been thrown away, has it, dear Emma?\"\n\n\"No, it has not, and I am very glad that I did learn it; I am a coward\nin apprehension, Alfred, but, perhaps, if I was put to the test, I\nshould behave better.\"\n\n\"That I really believe,\" replied Alfred; \"a gale of wind at sea sounds\nvery awful when down below jerking about in your hammock, but when on\ndeck, you don't care a fig about it. Now the rifles are all loaded, and\nwe may go to bed and sleep sound.\" They did retire to rest, but all\nparties did not sleep very sound; the howling of one wolf was answered\nby another; Emma and Mary embraced each other, and shuddered as they\nheard the sounds, and it was long before they forgot their alarm and\nwere asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nThe next morning was bright and clear, and when Emma and Mary went out,\nattended by Alfred, to go and milk the cows, although the cold was\nintense, every thing looked so brilliant and sparkling in the sunshine\nthat they regained their spirits. The lake was still unfrozen, and its\nwaters, which were of an azure blue, contrasted with the whole of the\ncountry covered with snow, and the spruce firs with their branches\nloaded presented an alternate layer of pure white and of the darkest\ngreen. Birds there were none to be seen or heard. All was quiet, so\nquiet that as they stepped along the path which had been cleared away to\nthe cow-house, they almost started at the sound of their own voices,\nwhich the atmosphere rendered more peculiarly sonorous and ringing.\nAlfred had his rifle on his shoulder, and walked in front of his\ncousins.\n\n\"I have come to prove that all your fears are groundless, my dear Emma,\nand that you need not have any alarm about a skulking, cowardly wolf,\"\nsaid Alfred.\n\n\"Well, that may be,\" replied Emma, \"but still we are very glad of your\ncompany.\"\n\nThey arrived at the cow-house without any adventure, let loose Sancho,\nwho had been tied up, as it was decided that the dog should remain at\nhome with the others, and proceded to milk the cows. Having finished\nthat task and supplied them with fodder, Mary Percival observed, as they\nwere retracing their steps,\n\n\"I must say that it would not only be more convenient but more agreeable\nif the cows were kept nearer to the house.\"\n\n\"It would be certainly,\" replied Alfred. \"It is a pity that there is not\na cow-shed within the palisades; but we have no means of making one at\npresent. Next year, when my father has purchased his horses and his\nsheep, which he talks of doing, we are to build a regular yard and sheds\nfor all the animals close to the house, and palisaded round as the house\nnow is, with a passage from one palisade to the other. Then it will be\nvery convenient; but 'Rome was not built in a day,' as the proverb says;\nand we must, therefore, wait another winter.\"\n\n\"And be devoured by the wolves in the mean time,\" replied Emma,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Why, you are getting over your fright already, Emma.\"\n\n\"Yes; I feel pretty bold, now I think there is nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nThe remainder of the week was passed away in practicing upon the\nsnow-shoes by the males of the party, the women scarcely ever venturing\nout of doors, as the cold was very severe. Mary and Emma were\naccompanied by Alfred for the first three or four days; and after that,\nnotwithstanding that the howling of the wolves was heard every night,\nthey took courage when they found that the animals never made their\nappearance by daylight, and went as before to milk the cows by\nthemselves. On the Saturday, they were in the hopes of seeing old\nMalachi Bone, but he did not make his appearance, and John, who could\nnow get on very well in his snow-shoes, became very impatient. Alfred\nand Martin were also very anxious to see the old man, that they might\nascertain if he had made any discoveries relative to the Indians.\nSunday, as usual, was a day of rest from labor; the services were read\nby Mr. Campbell, and the evening passed in serious conversation. Mr.\nCampbell, although usually in good spirits, was certainly not so on that\nevening: whether it was that the severity of the winter which had set in\nand the known long duration of it which they had to encounter had an\neffect upon his spirits, he was melancholy as well as serious. He more\nthan once referred to the former residence when in England, which was a\nvery unusual thing for him to do, and by degrees the conversation was\nturned in that direction, and, although no one said so, they all felt\nwhat a change there was in their present position from that which they\nhad been forced to leave. Mrs. Campbell, who perceived that a gloom was\ngathering over the whole party, made several remarks tending to\nreconcile them to their present lot, and, after a time Mr. Campbell\nobserved--\n\n\"Perhaps, my dear children, it may be a divine mercy which has sent you\nhere to this wilderness; true it is that we are removed from\ncivilization, and shut up here by a severe winter, deprived of the\nenjoyments and pleasures which are to be found in the society which we\nwere compelled to leave; but let us also bear in mind that we are\nremoved from the many temptations which might have there assailed us.\"\n\n\"But still, papa, you would be very glad if circumstances would permit\nus to return to England; would you not?\" said Percival.\n\n\"Yes, my child, I should, and even if I had remained here so long as to\nhave become attached to the place and to the isolation which at first is\nfelt so irksome, I would still return to England and to society, if I\nhad the means. As Christians, we are not to fly from the world and its\ntemptations, but to buckle on our armor, and putting our trust in Him\nwho will protect us, fight the good fight; that is, doing our duty in\nthat state of life to which it shall please God to call us.\"\n\n\"But if ever we were to return to England, there would be no chance of\nour living as we did before we left it, would there, papa?\"\n\n\"I see none, my dear boy; but we never know what is in store for us.\nShould any of us ever return, I presume it would be to live in a more\nhumble way; and for my part, I should prefer that it were so, for\nalthough I trust I did not greatly misuse that wealth which I so long\nsupposed to be mine, I should not be sorry to have much less, and\ntherefore less responsibility.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my dear Campbell, imperfect as we all are, I do not believe\nthat many could have made a better use of it than you did.\"\n\n\"I thought so at the time, my dear,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"but since it\nhas been lost to me, I have often thought that I might have done more\ngood with it. But the fact is, my dear children, there is nothing so\ndangerous to our eternal welfare as great wealth; it tends to harden the\nheart by affording the means of constant self-indulgence:--under such\ncircumstances, man is apt to become selfish, easily satisfied with his\nown works, and too proud to see his errors. Did you observe in the\nLitany, which I read at this morning's service, how very appropriately\nis inserted the prayer, for deliverance under the perils of wealth?--\n\n\"'In all time of our tribulation, in all time of our _wealth_, in the\nhour of death, and in the day of judgment, good Lord deliver us.'\n\n\"Examine this, my dear children: in all time of our tribulation,--that\nis in poverty and distress, and perhaps famishing from want (and in few\npositions are people so incited to crime), _then_ in all time of our\nwealth, evidently and distinctly placing wealth as more dangerous to the\nsoul's welfare than the extremest poverty and its accompanying\ntemptations; and observe, only exceeded by the most critical of all\ndangerous positions, when all has been done and nothing can be\nundone,--the hour of death, followed by the day of judgment.\"\n\nMr. Campbell ceased speaking, and there was a pause for a minute or two\nin the conversation, when Mary Percival said, \"What, then, my dear\nuncle, do you consider as the most enviable position in life?\"\n\n\"I consider a moderate independence as the most enviable; not occupied\nin trade, as the spirit of barter is too apt to make us bend to that\nwhich is actually fraud. I should say, a country gentleman living on his\nown property and among his own tenants, employing the poor around him,\nholds a position in which he has the least temptation to do wrong, and\nthe most opportunities of doing good.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, my dear Campbell,\" said his wife; \"and yet how few\nare satisfied even with that lot.\"\n\n\"Because the craving after wealth is so strong, that every one would\nhave more than he hath, and few men will be content. The desire of\naggrandizement overcomes and masters us; and yet what can be more absurd\nthan to witness the care and anxiety of those to gain riches, who have\nalready more perhaps than is necessary for their wants,--thus 'heaping\nup riches, not knowing who may gather them,' and endangering the soul to\nobtain that which they must leave behind them when they die. Others\namass wealth, not actuated by the avarice of hoarding it up, but by the\nappetite for expending it; who collect unjustly that they may lavish\nprofusely; these are equally foolish, and how important is that lesson\ngiven in the Scriptures.\" Mr. Campbell opened the Bible which lay before\nhim and read--\n\n    \"And he spake a parable unto them. The ground of a certain rich\n    man brought forth plentifully.\n\n    \"And he said, What shall I do? because I have no room where to\n    bestow my fruits.\n\n    \"And he said: This will I do; I will pull down my barns and build\n    greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.\n\n    \"And I will say to my soul: Soul, thou hast much goods laid up\n    for many years, take thine ease; eat, drink, and be merry.\n\n    \"But God said unto him: Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be\n    required of thee.\"\n\nAfter a short silence, Mrs. Campbell observed, \"I have often reflected\nsince I have been here upon what might have been our position had we\ndecided upon remaining in England. We might at this moment have been in\nthe greatest distress, even wanting a meal; and I have, therefore, often\nthanked God that He left us the means of coming here and providing for\nourselves as we have done, and as I have no doubt shall, with His\nblessing, continue to do. How much better off are we at this moment than\nmany thousands of our countrymen who remain in England! How many are\nstarving! How many are driven into crime from want! while we have a good\nroof over our heads, sufficient clothing and more than sufficient food.\nWe have, therefore, great reason to thank God for the mercies He has\nvouchsafed to us; He has heard our prayer, 'Give us this day our daily\nbread.'\" \"Yes,\" continued Mr. Campbell, \"'Give us this day our daily\nbread,' is all that we are taught to ask for; and it comprehends all;\nand yet how heartlessly is this pronounced by many of those who do\nrepeat their daily prayers. So is the blessing asked at meals, which is\nby too many considered as a mere matter of form. They forget, that He\nwho gives can also take away; and in their presumption, suppose their\nown ability and exertion to have been the sole means of procuring\nthemselves a daily supply of food; thanking themselves rather than the\nGiver of all good. How many thousands are there who have been supplied\nwith more than they require from their cradle down to their grave,\nwithout any grateful feeling toward Heaven; considering the butcher and\nbaker as their providers, and the debt canceled as soon as the bills are\npaid. How different must be the feeling of the poor cottager, who is\nuncertain whether his labor may procure him and his family a meal for\nthe morrow, who often suffers privation and hunger, and, what is more\npainful, witnesses the sufferings of those he loves. How earnest must be\nhis prayer when he cries, 'Give us this day our daily bread.'\"\n\nThis conversation had a very strong effect upon the party, and when they\nretired to rest, which they did shortly after, they laid their heads\nupon their pillows not only with resignation, but with thankfulness for\nthe mercies which had been vouchsafed to them, and felt that in the\nwilderness they were under the eye of a watchful and gracious\nProvidence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nOn the Monday morning Alfred and Martin went to the cow-house, and\nslaughtered the bullock which they had obtained from the commandant of\nthe fort. When it was skinned it was cut up, and carried to the\nstorehouse, where it was hung up for their winter consumption.\n\nAs the party were sitting down to dinner, they were greeted by Captain\nSinclair and a young lieutenant of the garrison. It hardly need be said\nthat the whole family were delighted to see them. They had come overland\non their snow-shoes, and brought some partridges, or grouse, as they are\nsometimes called, which they had shot on their way. Captain Sinclair had\nobtained leave from the commandant to come over and see how the\nCampbells were getting on. He had no news of any importance, as they had\nhad no recent communications with Quebec or Montreal; all was well at\nthe fort, and Colonel Forster had sent his compliments, and begged, if\nhe could be useful, that they would let him know. Captain Sinclair and\nhis friend sat down to dinner, and talked more than they ate, asking\nquestions about every thing.\n\n\"By the by, Mr. Campbell, where have you built your pig-sties?\"\n\n\"Inside the palisade, next to the fowl-house.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" replied Captain Sinclair, \"for otherwise you may be\ntroubled by the wolves, who are very partial to pork or mutton.\"\n\n\"We _have_ been troubled with them,\" replied Emma; \"at least with their\nhowlings at night, which make me tremble as I lie awake in bed.\"\n\n\"Never mind their howling, Miss Emma; we have plenty of them round the\nfort, I can assure you; unless attacked, they will not attack you, at\nleast, I never knew an instance, although I must confess that I have\nheard of them.\"\n\n\"You will, of course, sleep here to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes: we will, if you have a bear or buffalo skin to spare,\" replied\nCaptain Sinclair.\n\n\"We will manage it, I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"And if you could manage, Captain Sinclair,\" said Emma, somewhat archly,\n\"as you say that they are not dangerous animals, to bring us a few skins\nto-night, it would make the matter easy.\"\n\n\"Emma, how can you talk such nonsense?\" cried Mary Percival. \"Why should\nyou ask a guest to undertake such a service? Why have you not proposed\nit to Alfred or Henry, or even Martin?\"\n\n\"We will both try, if you please,\" replied Alfred.\n\n\"I must put my veto on any such attempts, Alfred,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\"We have sufficient danger to meet without running into it voluntarily,\nand we have no occasion for wolves' skins just now. I shall, however,\nventure to ask your assistance to-morrow morning. We wish to haul up the\nfishing-punt before the ice sets in on the lake, and we are not\nsufficiently strong-handed.\"\n\nDuring the day Captain Sinclair took Alfred aside to know if the old\nhunter had obtained any information relative to the Indians. Alfred\nreplied that they expected him every day, but as yet had not received\nany communication from him. Captain Sinclair stated that they were\nequally ignorant at the fort as to what had been finally arranged, and\nthat Colonel Forster was in hopes that the hunter would by this time\nhave obtained some intelligence.\n\n\"I should not be surprised if Malachi Bone were to come here to-morrow\nmorning,\" replied Alfred. \"He has been away a long while, and, I am\nsure, is as anxious to have John with him as John is impatient to go.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope he will; I shall be glad to have something to tell the\nColonel, as I made the request upon that ground. I believe, however,\nthat he was very willing that I should find an excuse for coming here,\nas he is more anxious about your family than I could have supposed. How\nwell your cousin Mary is looking.\"\n\n\"Yes; and so is Emma, I think. She has grown half a head since she left\nEngland. By the by, you have to congratulate me on my obtaining my rank\nas lieutenant.\"\n\n\"I do indeed, my dear fellow,\" replied Captain Sinclair. \"They will be\npleased to hear it at the fort. When will you come over?\"\n\n\"As soon as I can manage to trot a little faster on these snow-shoes.\nIf, however, the old hunter does not come to-morrow, I will go to the\nfort as soon as he brings us any news.\"\n\nThe accession to their party made them all very lively, and the evening\npassed away very agreeably. At night, Captain Sinclair and Mr. Gwynne\nwere ushered into the large bedroom, where all the younger male portion\nof the family slept, and which, as we before stated, had two spare\nbed-places.\n\nThe next morning, Captain Sinclair would have accompanied the Miss\nPercivals on their milking expedition, but as his services were required\nto haul up the fishing punt, he was obliged to go down, with all the\nrest of the men, to assist; Percival and John were the only ones left at\nhome with Mrs. Campbell. John, after a time, having, as usual, rubbed\ndown his rifle, threw it on his shoulder, and, calling the dogs which\nlay about, sallied forth for a walk, followed by the whole pack except\nold Sancho, who invariably accompanied the girls to the cow-house.\n\nMary and Emma tripped over the new-beaten snow-path to the cow-house,\nmerry and cheerful, with their pails in their hands, Emma laughing at\nCaptain Sinclair's disappointment at not being permitted to accompany\nthem. They had just arrived at the cow-house, when old Sancho barked\nfuriously, and sprang to the side of the building behind them, and in a\nmoment afterward rolled down the snowheap which he had sprung over,\nholding on and held fast by a large black wolf. The struggle was not\nvery long, and during the time that it lasted the girls were so\npanic-struck, that they remained like statues within two yards of the\nanimals. Gradually the old dog was overpowered by the repeated snapping\nbites of the wolf, yet he fought nobly to the last, when he dropped\nunder the feet of the wolf, his tongue hanging out, and bleeding\nprofusely and lifeless. As soon as his adversary was overpowered, the\nenraged animal, with his feet upon the body of the dog, bristling his\nhair and showing his powerful teeth, was evidently about to attack the\nyoung women. Emma threw her arm around Mary's waist, advancing her body\nso as to save her sister. Mary attempted the same, and then they\nremained waiting in horror for the expected spring of the animal, when\nof a sudden the other dogs came rushing forward, cheered on by John, and\nflew upon the animal. Their united strength soon tore him down to the\nground, and John coming up, as the wolf defended himself against his new\nassailants, put the muzzle of his rifle to the animal's head, and shot\nit dead.\n\nThe two sisters had held up during the whole of this alarming struggle;\nbut as soon as they perceived the wolf was dead and that they were safe,\nMary could stand no longer, and sank down on her knees, supporting her\nsister, who had become insensible.\n\nIf John showed gallantry in shooting the wolf, he certainly showed very\nlittle toward his cousins. He looked at Mary, nodded his head toward the\nwolf's body, and saying \"He's dead,\" shouldered his rifle, turned round\nand walked back to the house.\n\nOn his return he found that the party had just come back from hauling up\nthe punt, and were waiting the return of the Miss Percivals to go to\nbreakfast.\n\n\"Was that you who fired just now, John?\" said Martin.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied John.\n\n\"What did you fire at?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"A wolf,\" replied John.\n\n\"A wolf! where?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"At the cow-lodge,\" replied John.\n\n\"The cow-lodge!\" said his father.\n\n\"Yes; killed Sancho!\"\n\n\"Killed Sancho! why, Sancho was with your cousins!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied John.\n\n\"Then, where did you leave them?\"\n\n\"With the wolf,\" replied John, wiping his rifle very coolly.\n\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" cried Mr. Campbell, as Mrs. Campbell turned pale; and\nAlfred, Captain Sinclair, Martin, and Henry, seizing their rifles,\ndarted out from the house, and ran with all speed in the direction of\nthe cow-house.\n\n\"My poor girls!\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Wolf's dead, father,\" said John.\n\n\"Dead! Why didn't you say so, you naughty boy!\" cried Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"I wasn't asked,\" replied John.\n\nIn the meantime the other party had gained the cow-house; and, to their\nhorror, beheld the wolf and dog dead, and the two young women lying on\nthe snow, close to the two animals; for Mary had fainted away shortly\nafter John had walked off. They rushed toward the bodies of the two\ngirls, and soon discovered that they were not hurt. In a short time they\nwere recovered, and were supported by the young men to the house.\n\nAs soon as they arrived, Mrs. Campbell took them into their room, that\nthey might rally their spirits, and in a quarter of an hour returned to\nthe party outside, who eagerly inquired how they were.\n\n\"They are much more composed,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"and Emma has\nbegun to laugh again; but her laugh is rather hysterical and forced;\nthey will come out at dinner-time. It appears they are indebted to John\nfor their preservation, for they say the wolf was about to spring upon\nthem when he came to their assistance. We ought to be very grateful to\nHeaven for their preservation. I had no idea, after what Martin said\nabout the wolves, that they were so dangerous.\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, it is I that am most to blame, and that's the fact,\"\nreplied Martin. \"When we killed the bullock I threw the offal on the\nheap of snow close to the cow-lodge, meaning that the wolves and other\nanimals might eat it at night, but it seems this animal was hungry, and\nhad not left his meal when the dog attacked him, and that made the beast\nso _rily_ and savage.\"\n\n\"Yes; it was the fault of Martin and me,\" replied Alfred. \"Thank Heaven\nit's no worse!\"\n\n\"So far from it being a subject of regret, I consider it one of\nthankfulness,\" replied Mr. Campbell. \"This might have happened when\nthere was no one to assist, and our dear girls might have been torn to\npieces. Now that we know the danger, we may guard against it for the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Martin; \"in future some of us will drive the cows\nhome, to be milked every morning and evening; inside the palisade there\nwill be no danger. Master John, you have done well. You see, ma'am,\"\ncontinued Martin, \"what I said has come true. A rifle in the hands of a\nchild is as deadly a weapon as in the hands of a strong man.\"\n\n\"Yes; if courage and presence of mind attend its use,\" replied Mr.\nCampbell. \"John, I am very much pleased with your conduct.\"\n\n\"Mother called me naughty,\" replied John, rather sulkily.\n\n\"Yes, John, I called you naughty, for not telling us the wolf was dead,\nand leaving us to suppose your cousins were in danger; not for killing\nthe wolf. Now I kiss you, and thank you for your bravery and good\nconduct.\"\n\n\"I shall tell all the officers at the fort what a gallant little fellow\nyou are, John,\" said Captain Sinclair; \"there are very few of them who\nhave shot a wolf, and what is more, John, I have a beautiful dog, which\none of the officers gave me the other day in exchange for a pony, and I\nwill bring it over, and make it a present to you for your own dog. He\nwill hunt any thing, and he is very powerful--quite able to master a\nwolf, if you meet with one. He is half mastiff and half Scotch\ndeerhound, and he stands as high as this,\" continued Captain Sinclair,\nholding his hand about as high as John's shoulder.\n\n\"I'll go to the fort with you,\" said John, \"and bring him back.\"\n\n\"So you shall, John, and I'll go with you,\" said Martin, \"if master\npleases.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"I think he may; what with Martin, his own\nrifle, and the dog, John will, I trust be safe enough.\"\n\n\"Certainly, I have no objection,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"and many thanks\nto you, Captain Sinclair.\"\n\n\"What's the dog's name?\" said John.\n\n\"Oscar,\" replied Captain Sinclair. \"If you let him walk out with your\ncousins, they need not fear a wolf. He will never be mastered by one, as\npoor Sancho was.\"\n\n\"I'll lend him sometimes,\" replied John.\n\n\"Always; when you don't want him yourself, John.\"\n\n\"Yes, always,\" replied John, who was going out of the door.\n\n\"Where are you going, dear,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Going to skin the wolf,\" replied John, walking away.\n\n\"Well, he'll be a regular keen hunter,\" observed Martin, \"I dare say old\nBone has taught him to flay an animal. However, I'll go and help him,\nfor it's a real good skin.\" So saying, Martin followed John.\n\n\"Martin ought to have known better than to leave the offal where he\ndid,\" observed Captain Sinclair.\n\n\"We must not be too hard, Captain Sinclair,\" said Alfred. \"Martin has a\ncontempt for wolves, and that wolf would not have stood his ground had\nit been a man instead of two young women who were in face of him. Wolves\nare very cunning, and I know will attack a woman or child when they will\nfly from a man. Besides, it is very unusual for a wolf to remain till\ndaylight, even when there is offal to tempt him. It was the offal, the\nanimal's extreme hunger, and the attack of the dog--a combination of\ncircumstances--which produced the event. I do not see that Martin can be\nblamed, as one can not foresee every thing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" replied Captain Sinclair, \"and 'all's well that ends\nwell.'\"\n\n\"Are there any other animals to fear?\" inquired Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"The bear is now safe for the winter in the hollow of some tree or under\nsome root, where he has made a den. It will not come out till the\nspring. The catamount or panther is a much more dangerous animal than\nthe wolf; but it is scarce. I do think, however, that the young ladies\nshould not venture out, unless with some rifles in company, for fear of\nanother mischance. We have plenty of lynxes here; but I doubt if they\nwould attack even a child, although they fight when assailed, and bite\nand claw severely.\"\n\nThe Misses Percival now made their appearance. Emma was very merry, but\nMary rather grave. Captain Sinclair, having shaken hands with them both,\nsaid--\n\n\"Why, Emma, you appear to have recovered sooner than your sister!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Emma; \"but I was much more frightened than she was, and\nshe supported me, or I should have fallen at the wolf's feet. I yielded\nto my fears; Mary held up against hers; so, as her exertions were much\ngreater than mine, she has not recovered from them so soon. The fact is,\nMary is brave when there is danger, and I am only brave when there is\nnone.\"\n\n\"I was quite as much frightened as you, my dear Emma,\" said Mary\nPercival; \"but we must now help our aunt, and get dinner ready on the\ntable.\"\n\n\"I can not say that I have a wolfish appetite this morning,\" replied\nEmma, laughing; \"but Alfred will eat for me and himself too.\"\n\nIn a few minutes dinner was on the table, and they all sat down without\nwaiting for Martin and John, who were still busy skinning the wolf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n\"Here come Martin and John at last,\" said Mr. Campbell, after they had\nbeen about a quarter of an hour at table.\n\nBut he was mistaken; instead of Martin and John, Malachi Bone made his\nappearance, and, to their surprise, accompanied by his young squaw, the\nStrawberry Plant.\n\nEvery one rose to welcome them, and the Misses Percival went to their\nlittle female acquaintance, and would have made her sit down with them,\nbut she refused and took her seat on the floor near the fire.\n\n\"She ain't used to chairs and stools, miss; let her be where she is,\"\nsaid old Bone, \"she'll be more comfortable, and that's what you want\nher to be, I'm sure. I brought her with me, because I could not carry\nall the venison myself, and also to show her the way in and out of the\nhouse, and how it is fastened, in case of sending a message by night.\"\n\n\"Of sending a message by night,\" said Mrs. Campbell, with surprise,\n\"why, what possible occasion could there be for that?\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair and Alfred, who perceived that the old hunter had said\ntoo much, were quite at a loss what to say. They did not like to\nfrighten Mrs. Campbell and the girls about the Indians, especially as\nthey had just been so much alarmed with the accident of the morning. At\nlast Alfred replied, \"The fact is, my dear mother, that 'forewarned is\nbeing forearmed,' as the saying is; and I told Martin to request Malachi\nBone, if he should hear of any Indians being about or near us, to let us\nknow immediately.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, that is the whole story,\" continued Malachi. \"It's the best\nplan, when you're in the woods, always to have your rifle loaded.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell and the girls were evidently not a little fluttered at\nthis fresh intimation of danger. Captain Sinclair perceived it, and\nsaid, \"We have always spies on the look-out at the fort, that we may\nknow where the Indians are and what they are about. Last month, we know\nthat they held a council, but that it broke up without their coming to\nany determination, and that no hostile feeling was expressed so far as\nwe could ascertain. But we never trust the Indians, and they, knowing\nthat we watch them, have been very careful not to commit any outrages;\nthey have not done so for a long while, nor do I think they will venture\nagain. At the same time, we like to know where they are, and I requested\nAlfred to speak to Malachi Bone, to send us immediately word if he heard\nor saw any thing of them: not, however, that I intended that the ladies\nshould be wakened up in the middle of the night,\" continued Captain\nSinclair, laughing; \"that was not at all necessary.\"\n\nMalachi Bone would have responded, but Alfred pinched his arm; the old\nman understood what was meant, and held his tongue; at last he said--\n\n\"Well, well, there's no harm done, it's just as well that the Strawberry\nshould know her way about the location, if it's only to know where the\ndogs are, in case she comes of a message.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"I'm glad that she is come, and hope she\nwill come very often. Now, Malachi, sit down and eat something.\"\n\n\"Well, but about the Indians, Captain Sinclair,--\" said Mrs. Campbell;\n\"that you have not told us all I am certain, and the conviction that\nsuch is the case, will make me and the girls very uneasy; so pray do\ntreat us as we ought to be treated; we share the danger, and we ought to\nknow what the danger is.\"\n\n\"I do not think that there is any danger, Mrs. Campbell,\" replied\nCaptain Sinclair, \"unless Malachi has further information to give us. I\ndo, however, perfectly agree with you, that you ought to know all that\nwe know, and am quite ready to enter upon the subject, trifling as it\nis.\"\n\n\"So I presume it must be, my dear,\" observed Mr. Campbell, \"for I have\nas yet known nothing about the matter. So pray, Captain Sinclair,\ninstruct us all.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair then stated what he had before mentioned to Alfred, and\nhaving so done, and pointed out that there was no occasion for alarm, he\nrequested Malachi Bone would say if he had any further information.\n\n\"The Injuns did meet as you say, and they could not agree, so they broke\nup, and are now all out upon their hunting and trapping for furs. But\nthere's one thing I don't exactly feel comfortable about, which is that\nthe 'Angry Snake,' as he is called, who was at the 'talk,' and was\nmighty venomous against the English, has squatted for the winter\nsomewhere hereabout.\"\n\n\"The Angry Snake,\" said Captain Sinclair. \"Is that the chief who served\nwith the French, and wears a medal?\"\n\n\"The very same, sir. He's not a chief though; he was a very good warrior\nin his day, and the French were very partial to him, as he served them\nwell; but he is no chief, although he was considered as a sort of one\nfrom the consequence he obtained with the French. He is an old man now,\nand a very bitter one. Many's the Englishman that he has tied to the\nstake, and tortured during the war; He hates us, and is always stirring\nup the Injuns to make war with us; but his day is gone by, and they do\nnot heed him at the council now.\"\n\n\"Then, why are you uncomfortable about him?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Because he has taken up his quarters for the winter hunting not far\nfrom us, with six or seven of the young warriors, who look up to him,\nand he is mischievous. If the Injun nation won't make war, he will do\nsomething on his own account, if he possibly can. He's not badly named,\nI can tell you.\"\n\n\"Will he attack you?\"\n\n\"Me! no, no; he knows better. He knows my rifle well; he has the mark on\nhis body; not but that he would if he dared, but I am Injun myself, and\nknow Injun craft. Then you see, these people have strange ideas. During\nthe whole war they never could even hit me with their rifles, and they\nthink I am not to be hurt--that's their superstition--and my rifle, they\nthink, never misses (they're almost right there, for it does not once in\na hundred times), so what with this and that, they fear me as a\nsupernatural, as we call it. But that's not the case with you all here;\nand if the Snake could creep within these palisades, he might be\nmischievous.\"\n\n\"But the tribes know very well that any attack of this kind would be\nconsidered as a declaration of hostilities,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"and\nthat we should retaliate.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you see the Snake don't belong to these tribes about us; his\nnation is much further off,--too far to go for redress; and the tribes\nhere, although they allow him to join the 'talk' as an old warrior who\nhad served against the English and from respect to his age, do not\nacknowledge him or his doings. They would disavow them immediately and\nwith truth, but they can not prevent his doing mischief.\"\n\n\"What, then, is the redress in case of his doing any mischief?\" said\nHenry.\n\n\"Why, upon him and his band, whenever you can find them. You may\ndestroy them all, and the Injuns here won't say a word, or make any\ncomplaint. That's all that can be done; and that's what I will do; I\nmean to tell him so, when I meet him. He fears me, and so do his men;\nthey think me medicine.\"\n\n\"Medicine! What is that?\" said Henry.\n\n\"It means that he has a charmed life,\" replied Captain Sinclair. \"The\nIndians are very superstitious.\"\n\n\"Yes, they be; well, perhaps, I'll prove medicine; and I'll give them a\npill or two out of my rifle,\" said Malachi, with a grim smile.\n\"Howsomever, I'll soon learn more about them, and will let you know when\nI do. Just keep your palisade gates fast at night and the dogs inside of\nthem, and at any time I'll give you warning. If I am on their trail the\nStrawberry shall come, and that's why I brought her here. If you hear\nthree knocks outside the palisade at any hour of the night, why, it will\nbe her, so let her in.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"I'm very glad that you have told me all\nthis; now I know what we have to expect, I shall be more courageous and\nmuch more on my guard.\"\n\n\"I think we have done wisely in letting you know all we knew ourselves,\"\nsaid Captain Sinclair. \"I must soon take my leave, as I must be at the\nfort before sunset. Martin and John are to come with me, and bring back\nthe dog.\"\n\n\"Ain't the boy going with me?\" said Malachi.\n\n\"Yes; to-morrow morning he may go, but after his return from the fort it\nwill be too late.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I may as well stay here,\" replied Malachi. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He is gone to skin a wolf, which he shot this morning,\" replied Alfred.\n\"He will soon be here.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell shortly related to Malachi the adventure of the wolf. The\nold hunter listened in silence, and then gave a nod of approbation.\n\n\"I reckon he'll bring home more skins than that this winter,\" said he.\n\nThe party then rose just as Martin and John made their appearance.\nCaptain Sinclair conversed with the Misses Percival, while the old\nhunter spoke to the Strawberry Plant in her own dialect; the others\neither went out or were busy in clearing the table, till Captain\nSinclair took his departure with John and Martin, each armed with a\nrifle.\n\n\"Well, this has been an exciting day,\" observed Mr. Campbell, a little\nbefore they retired to bed. \"We have much to thank God for, and great\nreason to pray for His continued protection and assistance. God bless\nyou all, my children; good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nThe next morning, a little after daybreak, Martin and John made their\nappearance, leading the magnificent dog which Captain Sinclair had given\nto John. Like most large dogs, Oscar appeared to be very good-tempered,\nand treated the snarling and angry looks of the other dogs with perfect\ncontempt.\n\n\"It is, indeed, a noble animal,\" said Mr. Campbell, patting its head.\n\n\"It's a fine creature,\" observed Malachi, \"a wolf would stand no chance\nagainst him, and even a bear would have more on its hands than it could\nwell manage I expect; but, come here, boy,\" said the old hunter to John,\nleading the dog outside of the door.\n\n\"You'd better leave the dog, John,\" said Malachi, \"the crittur will be\nof use here, but of no good to us.\"\n\nJohn made no reply, and the hunter continued--\n\n\"I say it will be of use here, for the girls might meet with another\nwolf, or the house might be attacked; but good hunters don't want dogs.\nIs it to watch for us, and give us notice of danger? Why that's our\nduty, and we must trust to ourselves, and not to an animal. Is it to\nhunt for us? Why no dog can take a deer so well as we can with our\nrifles; a dog may discover us when we wish to be hidden; a dog's track\nwill mark us out when we would wish our track to be doubted. The animal\nwill be of no utility ever to us, John, and may do us harm, 'specially\nnow the snow's on the ground. In the summer-time, you can take him and\nteach him how to behave as a hunter's dog should behave; but we had\nbetter leave him now, and start at once.\"\n\nJohn nodded his head in assent, and then went in-doors.\n\n\"Good-by,\" said John, going up to his mother and cousins; \"I shall not\ntake the dog.\"\n\n\"Won't take the dog! well, that's very kind of you, John,\" said Mary,\n\"for we were longing to have him to protect us.\"\n\nJohn shouldered his rifle, made a sign to Strawberry Plant, who rose,\nand looking kindly at Mrs. Campbell and the girls, without speaking,\nfollowed John out of the hut. Malachi certainly was not very polite, for\nhe walked off, in company with John and the squaw, without taking the\ntrouble to say \"Good-by.\" It must, however, be observed that he was in\nconversation with Martin, who accompanied them on the way.\n\nThe winter had now become very severe. The thermometer was twenty\ndegrees below the freezing point, and the cold was so intense, that\nevery precaution was taken against it. More than once Percival, whose\nbusiness it was to bring in the firewood, was frost bitten, but as Mrs.\nCampbell was very watchful, the remedy of cold snow was always\nsuccessfully applied. The howling of the wolves continued every night,\nbut they were now used to it, and the only effect was, when one came\nmore than usually close to the house, to make Oscar raise his head,\ngrowl, listen awhile, and then lie down to sleep again. Oscar became\nvery fond of the girls, and was their invariable companion whenever they\nleft the house. Alfred, Martin and Henry went out almost daily on\nhunting excursions; indeed, as there were no crops in the barn, they had\nlittle else to do. Mr. Campbell remained at home with his wife and\nnieces; occasionally, but not very often, Percival accompanied the\nhunters; of Malachi and John, they saw but little; John returned about\nevery ten days, but although he adhered to his promise, his anxiety to\ngo back to Malachi was so very apparent, and he was so restless, that\nMrs. Campbell rather wished him to be away, than remain at home so much\nagainst his will.\n\nThus passed away the time till the year closed in; confined as they were\nby the severity of the weather, and having little or nothing to do, the\nwinter appeared longer and more tedious than it would have done had they\nbeen settled longer, and had the crops to occupy their attention; for it\nis in the winter that the Canadian farmer gets through all his thrashing\nand other work connected with the farm, preparatory for the coming\nspring. This being their first winter, they had, of course, no crops\ngathered in, and were, therefore, in want of employment. Mrs. Campbell\nand her nieces worked and read, and employed themselves in every way\nthat they could, but constantly shut up within doors, they could not\nhelp feeling the monotony and _ennui_ of their situation. The young men\nfound occupation and amusement in the chase; they brought a variety of\nanimals and skins, and the evenings were generally devoted to a\nnarration of what occurred in the day during their hunting excursions,\nbut even these histories of the chase were at last heard with\nindifference. It was the same theme only with variations, over and over\nagain, and there was no longer much excitement in listening.\n\n\"I wonder when John will come back again,\" observed Emma to her sister,\nas they were sitting at work.\n\n\"Why he only left two days ago, so we must not expect him for some\ntime.\"\n\n\"I know that; I wonder if Oscar would kill a wolf; I should like to take\nhim out and try.\"\n\n\"I thought you had had enough of wolves already, Emma,\" replied Mary.\n\n\"Yes, well; that old Malachi will never bring us any more news about the\nIndians,\" continued Emma, yawning.\n\n\"Why, I do not think that any news about them is likely to be pleasant\nnews, Emma, and therefore, why should you wish it?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear Mary, because I want _some_ news; I want something to\nexcite me, I feel so dull. It's nothing but stitch, stitch, all day,\nand I am tired of always doing the same thing. What a horrid thing a\nCanadian winter Is, and not one-half over yet.\"\n\n\"It is very dull and monotonous, my dear Emma, I admit, and if we had\nmore variety of employment, we should find it more agreeable, but we\nought to feel grateful that we have a good house over our heads, and\nmore security than we anticipated.\"\n\n\"Almost too much security, Mary; I begin to feel that I could welcome an\nIndian even in his war-paint, just by way of a little change.\"\n\n\"I think you would soon repent of your wish, if it were gratified.\"\n\n\"Very likely, but I can not help wishing it now. When will they come\nhome? What o'clock is it? I wonder what they'll bring: the old story I\nsuppose, a buck; I'm sick of venison.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Emma, you are wrong to feel such discontent and weariness.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am, but I have not walked a hundred yards for nearly one\nhundred days, and that will give one the blues, as they call them, and I\ndo nothing but yawn, yawn, yawn, for want of air and exercise. Uncle\nwon't let us move out on account of that horrid wolf. I wonder how\nCaptain Sinclair is getting on at the fort, and whether he is as dull as\nwe are.\"\n\nTo do Emma justice, it was seldom that she indulged herself in such\nlamentations, but the tedium was more than her high flow of spirits\ncould well bear. Mrs. Campbell made a point of arranging the household,\nwhich gave her occupation, and Mary from natural disposition did not\nfeel the confinement as much as Emma did; whenever, therefore, she did\nshow symptoms of restlessness or was tempted to utter a complaint, they\nreasoned with and soothed, but never reproached her.\n\nThe day after this conversation, Emma, to amuse herself, took a rifle\nand went out with Percival. She fired several shots at a mark, and by\ndegrees acquired some dexterity; gradually she became fond of the\nexercise, and not a day passed that she and Percival did not practice\nfor an hour or two, until at last Emma could fire with great precision.\nPractice and a knowledge of the perfect use of your weapon gives\nconfidence, and this Emma did at last acquire. She challenged Alfred and\nHenry to fire at the bull's eye with her, and whether by their gallantry\nor her superior dexterity, she was declared victor. Mr. and Mrs.\nCampbell smiled when Emma came in and narrated her success, and felt\nglad that she had found something which afforded her amusement.\n\nIt happened that one evening the hunters were very late; it was a clear\nmoonlight night, but at eight o'clock they had not made their\nappearance; Percival had opened the door to go out for some firewood\nwhich had been piled within the palisades, and as it was later than the\nusual hour for locking the palisade gates, Mr. Campbell had directed him\nso to do. Emma, attracted by the beauty of the night, was at the door of\nthe house, when the howl of a wolf was heard close to them; the dogs\naccustomed to it merely sprang on their feet, but did not leave the\nkitchen fire; Emma went out, and looked through the palisades to see if\nshe could perceive the animal, and little Trim, the terrier, followed\nher. Now Trim was so small, that he could creep between the palisades,\nand as soon as he was close to them, perceiving the wolf, the courageous\nlittle animal squeezed through them and flew toward it, barking as loud\nas he could. Emma immediately ran in, took down her rifle and went out\nagain, as she knew that poor Trim would soon be devoured. The\nsupposition was correct: the wolf, instead of retreating, closed with\nthe little dog and seized it. Emma, who could now plainly perceive the\nanimal, which was about forty yards from her, took aim and fired, just\nas poor Trim gave a loud yelp. Her aim was good, and the wolf and dog\nlay side by side. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, and Mary, hearing the report of\nthe rifle, ran out, and found Percival and Emma at the palisades behind\nthe house.\n\n\"I have killed him, aunt,\" said Emma, \"but I fear he has killed poor\nlittle Trim; do let us go out and see.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear Emma, that must not be; your cousins will be home soon,\nand then we shall know how the case stands; but the risk is too great.\"\n\n\"Here they come,\" said Percival, \"as fast as they can run.\"\n\nThe hunters were soon at the palisade door and admitted; they had no\ngame with them. Emma jeered them for coming back empty handed.\n\n\"No, no, my little cousin,\" replied Alfred, \"we heard the report of a\nrifle, and we threw down our game, that we might sooner come to your\nassistance if you required it. What was the matter?\"\n\n\"Only that I have killed a wolf, and am not allowed to bring in my\ntrophy,\" replied Emma. \"Come, Alfred, I may go with you and Martin.\"\n\nThey went to the spot, and found the wolf was dead, and poor Trim dead\nalso by his side. They took in the body of the little dog, and left the\nwolf till the morning, when Martin said he would skin it for Miss Emma.\n\n\"And I'll make a footstool of it,\" said Emma; \"that shall be my revenge\nfor the fright I had from the other wolf. Come, Oscar, good dog; you and\nI will go wolf-hunting. Dear me, who would have thought that I should\nhave ever killed a wolf--poor little Trim!\"\n\nMartin said it would be useless to return for the venison, as the wolves\nhad no doubt eaten it already; so they locked the palisade gate, and\nwent into the house.\n\nEmma's adventure was the topic of the evening, and Emma herself was much\npleased at having accomplished such a feat.\n\n\"Well,\" said Martin, \"I never knew but one woman who faced a wolf except\nMiss Emma.\"\n\n\"And who was that, Martin?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n[FACING A WOLF.]\n\n\"It was a wife of one of our farmers, ma'am; she was at the outhouse\ndoing something, when she perceived a wolf enter the cottage-door, where\nthere was nobody except the baby in the cradle. She ran back and found\nthe wolf just lifting the infant out of the cradle by its clothes. The\nanimal looked at her with his eyes flashing; but having its mouth full,\nit did not choose to drop the baby, and spring at her; all it wanted was\nto get clear off with its prey. The woman had presence of mind enough to\ntake down her husband's rifle and point it to the wolf, but she was so\nfearful of hurting the child, that she did not put the muzzle to its\nhead, but to its shoulder. She fired just as the wolf was making off,\nand the animal fell, and could not get on its feet again, and it then\ndropped the child out of its mouth to attack the mother. The woman\ncaught the child up, but the wolf gave her a severe bite on the arm, and\nbroke the bone near the wrist. A wolf has a wonderful strong jaw, ma'am.\nHowever, the baby was saved, and neighbors came and dispatched the\nanimal.\"\n\n\"What a fearful position for a mother to be in!\" exclaimed Mrs.\nCampbell.\n\n\"Where did that happen?\"\n\n\"On the White Mountains, ma'am,\" replied Martin. \"Malachi Bone told me\nthe story; he was born there.\"\n\n\"Then he is an American.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, he is an American because he was born in this country, but\nit was English when he was born, so he calls himself an Englishman.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Mrs. Campbell, \"he was born before the colonies\nobtained their independence.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, long before; there's no saying how old he is. When I was\nquite a child, I recollect he was then reckoned an old man; indeed, the\nname the Indians gave to him proves it. He then was called the 'Gray\nBadger.'\"\n\n\"But is he so very old, do you really think, Martin?\"\n\n\"I think he has seen more than sixty snows, ma'am; but not many more;\nthe fact is, his hair was gray before he was twenty years old; he told\nme so himself, and that's one reason why the Indians are so fearful of\nhim. They have it from their fathers that the Gray Badger was a great\nhunter, as Malachi was more than forty years ago; so they imagine as his\nhair was gray then, he must have been a very old man at that time back,\nand so to them he appears to live forever, and they consider him as\ncharmed, and to use their phrase, 'great _medicine_.' I've heard some\nIndians declare that Malachi had seen one hundred and fifty winters, and\nthey really believe it. I never contradicted them, as you may imagine.\"\n\n\"Does he live comfortably?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, he does; his squaw knows what he wants, and does what she\nis bid. She is very fond of the old man, and looks upon him, as he\nreally is to her, as a father. His lodge is always full of meat, and he\nhas plenty of skins. He don't drink spirits, and if he has tobacco for\nsmoking and powder and ball, what else can he want?\"\n\n\"Happy are they whose wants are so few,\" observed Mr. Campbell. \"A man\nin whatever position in life, if he is content, is certain to be happy.\nHow true are the words of the poet:--\n\n                   'Man wants but little here below,\n                    Nor wants that little long!'\n\nMalachi Bone is a happier man than hundreds in England who live in\nluxury. Let us profit, my dear children, by his example, and learn to be\ncontent with what Heaven has bestowed upon us. But it is time to retire.\nThe wind has risen, and we shall have a blustering night. Henry, fetch\nme the book.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nAlfred and Martin brought in the wolf which Emma had killed, but it was\nfrozen so hard that they could not skin it. Poor little Trim was also\ncarried in, but the ground was too hard frozen for them to bury the\nbody, so they put it into the snow until the spring, when a thaw would\ntake place. As for the wolf, they said nothing about it, but they\nremained up when the rest of the family retired, and after the wolf had\nbeen some time before the fire, they were able to take off the skin.\n\nOn the following morning, when the hunters went out, they were\nparticularly desired to shoot a wild turkey if they could, as the next\nday was Christmas-day.\n\n\"Let us take Oscar with us,\" said Alfred; \"he is very swift, and may run\nthem down; we never can get up with them in our snow-shoes.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether they will get a turkey,\" said Emma, after the hunting\nparty had left.\n\n\"I think it will be difficult,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"but they will try\nall they can.\"\n\n\"I hope they will; for Christmas-day without a turkey will be very\nun-English.\"\n\n\"We are not in England, my dear Emma,\" said Mr. Campbell; \"and wild\nturkeys are not to be ordered from the poulterer's.\"\n\n\"I know that we are not in England, my dear uncle, and I feel it too.\nHow was the day before every Christmas-day spent at Wexton Hall! What\npiles of warm blankets, what a quantity of duffil cloaks, flannels, and\nworsted stockings were we all so busy and so happy in preparing and\nsorting to give away on the following morning, that all within miles of\nus should be warmly clothed on that day. And, then, the housekeeper's\nroom with all the joints of meat, and flour and plums and suet, in\nproportion to the number of each family, all laid out and ticketed ready\nfor distribution. And then the party invited to the servants' hall, and\nthe great dinner, and the new clothing for the school-girls, and the\nchurch so gay, with their new dresses in the aisles, and the holly and\nthe mistletoe. I know we are not in England, my dear uncle, and that you\nhave lost one of your greatest pleasures--that of doing good, and making\nall happy around you.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Emma, if I have lost the pleasure of doing good, it is\nthe will of Heaven that it should be so, and we ought to be thankful\nthat, if not dispensing charity, at all events, we are not the objects\nof charity to others; that we are independent, and earning an honest\nlivelihood. People may be very happy, and feel the most devout gratitude\non the anniversary of so great a mercy, without having a turkey for\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I was not in earnest about the turkey, my dear uncle. It was the\nassociation of ideas connected by long habit, which made me think of our\nChristmas times at Wexton Hall; but, indeed, my dear uncle, if there was\nregret, it was not for myself so much as for you,\" replied Emma, with\ntears in her eyes.\n\n\"Perhaps I spoke rather too severely, my dearest Emma,\" said Mr.\nCampbell; \"but I did not like to hear such a solemn day spoken of as if\nit were commemorated merely by the eating of certain food.\"\n\n\"It was foolish of me,\" replied Emma? \"and it was said thoughtlessly.\"\n\nEmma went up to Mr. Campbell and kissed him, and Mr. Campbell said,\n\"Well, I hope there will be a turkey, since you wish for one.\"\n\nThe hunters did not return till late, and when they appeared in sight,\nPercival, who had descried them, came in and said that they were very\nwell loaded, and were bringing in their game slung upon a pole.\n\nMary and Emma went out of the door to meet their cousins. That there was\na heavy load carried on a pole between Martin and Alfred was certain,\nbut they could not distinguish what it consisted of. As the party\narrived at the palisade gates, however, they discovered that it was not\ngame, but a human being, who was carried on a sort of litter made of\nboughs.\n\n\"What is it, Alfred?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Wait till I recover my breath,\" said Alfred, as he reached the door,\n\"or ask Henry, for I'm quite knocked up.\"\n\nHenry then went with his cousins into the house, and explained to them\nthat as they were in pursuit of the wild turkeys, Oscar had stopped\nsuddenly and commenced baying; that they went up to the dog, and, in a\nbush, they found a poor Indian woman nearly frozen to death, and with a\ndislocation of the ankle, so severe that her leg was terribly swelled,\nand she could not move. Martin had spoken to her in the Indian tongue,\nand she was so exhausted with cold and hunger that she could just tell\nhim that she belonged to a small party of Indians who had been some days\nout hunting, and a long way from where they had built their winter\nlodges; that she had fallen with the weight which she had carried, and\nthat her leg was so bad, she could not go on with them; that they had\ntaken her burden, and left her to follow them when she could.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Alfred; \"left the poor creature without food, to perish\nin the snow. One day more, and it would have been all over with her. It\nis wonderful how she can have lived through the two last nights as she\nhas. But Martin says the Indians always do leave a woman to perish in\nthis way or recover as she can, if she happens to meet with an\naccident.\"\n\n\"At all events, let us bring her in at once,\" said Mr. Campbell. \"I will\nfirst see if my surgical assistance can be of use, and after that we\nwill do what we can for her. How far from this did you find her?\"\n\n\"About eight miles,\" replied Henry; \"and Alfred has carried her almost\nthe whole way; Martin and I have relieved each other, except once, when\nI took Alfred's place.\"\n\n\"And so you perceive, Emma, instead of a wild turkey I have brought an\nIndian squaw,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"I love you better for your kindness, Alfred,\" replied Emma, \"than if\nyou had brought me a wagon-load of turkeys.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Martin and Henry brought in the poor Indian, and laid\nher down on the floor at some distance from the fire, for though she was\nnearly dead with the cold, too sudden an exposure to heat would have\nbeen almost equally fatal. Mr. Campbell examined her ankle, and with a\nlittle assistance reduced the dislocation. He then bound up her leg and\nbathed it with warm vinegar, as a first application. Mrs. Campbell and\nthe two girls chafed the poor creature's limbs till the circulation was\na little restored, and then they gave her something warm to drink. It\nwas proposed by Mrs. Campbell that they should make up a bed for her on\nthe floor of the kitchen. This was done in a corner near the fire-place,\nand in about an hour their patient fell into a sound sleep.\n\n\"It is lucky for her that she did not fall into that sleep before we\nfound her,\" said Martin; \"she would never have awoke again.\"\n\n\"Most certainly not,\" replied Mr. Campbell. \"Have you any idea what\ntribe she is of, Martin?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; she is one of the Chippeways; there are many divisions of\nthem, but I will find out when she awakes again to which she belongs;\nshe was too much exhausted when we found her, to say much.\"\n\n\"It appears very inhuman leaving her to perish in that way,\" observed\nMrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, so it does; but necessity has no law. The Indians could\nnot, if they would, have carried her, perhaps one hundred miles. It\nwould have probably been the occasion of more deaths, for the cold is\ntoo great now for sleeping out at nights for any time, although they do\ncontrive with the help of a large fire to stay out sometimes.\"\n\n\"Self-preservation is the first law of nature, certainly,\" observed Mr.\nCampbell; \"but, if I recollect right the savage does not value the life\nof a woman very highly.\"\n\n\"That's a fact, sir,\" replied Martin; \"not much more, I reckon, than you\nwould a beast of burden.\"\n\n\"It is always the case among savage nations,\" observed Mr. Campbell;\n\"the first mark of civilization is the treatment of the other sex, and\nin proportion as civilization increases, so are the women protected and\nwell used. But your supper is ready, my children, and I think after your\nfatigue and fasting you must require it.\"\n\n\"I am almost too tired to eat,\" observed Alfred, \"I shall infinitely\nmore enjoy a good sleep under my bear skin. At the same time I'll try\nwhat I can do,\" continued he, laughing, and taking his seat at table.\n\nNotwithstanding Alfred's observation, he contrived to make a very hearty\nsupper, and Emma laughed at his appetite after his professing that he\nhad so little inclination to eat.\n\n\"I said I was too tired to eat, Emma, and so I felt at the time; but as\nI became more refreshed my appetite returned,\" replied Alfred, laughing,\n\"and notwithstanding your jeering me, I mean to eat some more.\"\n\n\"How long has John been away?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Now nearly a fortnight,\" observed Mrs. Campbell; \"he promised to come\nhere Christmas-day. I suppose we shall see him to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; and old Bone will come with him, I dare say. He said as\nmuch to me when he was going away the last time. He observed that the\nboy could not bring the venison, and perhaps _he_ would if he had any,\nfor he knows that people like plenty of meat on Christmas day.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether old Malachi is any way religious,\" observed Mary. \"Do\nyou think he is, Martin?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; I think he feels it, but does not show it. I know from\nmyself what are, probably, his feelings on the subject. When I have been\naway for weeks and sometimes for months, without seeing or speaking to\nany one, all alone in the woods, I feel more religious than I do when at\nQuebec on my return, although I do go to church. Now old Malachi has, I\nthink, a solemn reverence for the Divine Being, and strict notions of\nduty, so far as he understands it,--but as he never goes to any town or\nmixes with any company, so the rites of religion, as I may call them,\nand the observances of the holy feast, are lost to him, except as a sort\nof dream of former days, before he took to his hunter's life. Indeed, he\nseldom knows what day or even what month it is. He knows the seasons as\nthey come and go, and that's all. One day is the same as another, and he\ncan not tell which is Sunday, for he is not able to keep a reckoning.\nNow, ma'am, when you desired Master John to be at home on the Friday\nfortnight because it was Christmas-day, I perceived old Malachi in deep\nthought: he was recalling to mind what Christmas-day was; if you had not\nmentioned it, the day would have passed away like any other; but you\nreminded him, and then it was that he said he would come if he could.\nI'm sure that now he knows it is Christmas-day, he intends to keep it as\nsuch.\"\n\n\"There is much truth in what Martin says,\" observed Mr. Campbell; \"we\nrequire the seventh day in the week and other stated seasons of devotion\nto be regularly set apart, in order to keep us in mind of our duties and\npreserve the life of religion. In the woods, remote from communion with\nother Christians, these things are easily forgotten, and when once we\nhave lost our calculation, it is not to be recovered. But come, Alfred\nand Henry and Martin must be very tired, and we had better all go to\nbed. I will sit up a little while to give some drink to my patient, if\nshe wishes it. Good-night, my children.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nChristmas-day was indeed a change, as Emma had observed, from their\nformer Christmas; but although the frost was more than usually severe,\nand the snow filled the air with its white flakes, and the north-east\nwind howled through the leafless trees as they rasped their long arms\nagainst each other, and the lake was one sheet of thick ice with a\ncovering of snow which the wind had in different places blown up into\nhillocks, still they had a good roof over their heads, and a warm,\nblazing fire on the hearth: and they had no domestic miseries, the worst\nmiseries of all to contend against, for they were a united family,\nloving and beloved; showing mutual acts of kindness and mutual acts of\nforbearance; proving how much better was \"a dish of herbs where love is,\nthan the stalled ox with hatred therewith.\" Moreover they were all\npiously disposed; they were sensible that they owed a large debt of\ngratitude to Heaven for all its daily mercies in providing them with\nfood and raiment, for warding off from them sickness and sorrow, and\ngiving them humble and contented hearts; and on this day, they felt how\nlittle were all worldly considerations, compared with the hopes which\nwere held out to them through the great sacrifice which the goodness and\nmercy of God had made for them and all the world. It was, therefore,\nwith cheerful yet subdued looks that they greeted each other when they\nmet previous to the morning prayers.\n\nMr. Campbell had already visited his patient and readjusted the bandage:\nher ankle was better, but still very much swelled; the poor creature\nmade no complaints, she looked grateful for what was done and for the\nkindness shown to her. They were all arrayed in their best Sunday\ndresses, and as soon as prayers were over had just wished each other the\ncongratulations so general, so appropriate, and yet too often so\nthoughtlessly given upon the anniversary, when Malachi Bone, his little\nsquaw the Strawberry, and John, entered the door of the hut, laden with\nthe sports of the forest, which they laid down in the corner of the\nkitchen, and then saluted the party.\n\n\"Here we are all together on Christmas-day,\" said Emma, who had taken\nthe hand of the Strawberry.\n\nThe Indian girl smiled, and nodded her head.\n\n\"And, John, you have brought us three wild turkeys; you are a good boy,\nJohn,\" continued Emma.\n\n\"If we only had Captain Sinclair here now,\" said Martin to Emma and Mary\nPercival, who was by Emma's side, shaking hands with the Strawberry.\n\nMary colored up a little, and Emma replied, \"Yes, Martin, we do want\nhim, for I always feel as if he belonged to the family.\"\n\n\"Well, it's not his fault that he's not here,\" replied Martin; \"it's now\nmore than six weeks since he has left, and if the Colonel would allow\nhim, I'm sure that Captain Sinclair----\"\n\n\"Would be here on this day,\" said Captain Sinclair, who with Mr. Gwynne,\nhis former companion, had entered the door of the house without being\nobserved; for the rest of the party were in conversation with Malachi\nBone and John.\n\n\"Oh, how glad I am to see you,\" cried Emma; \"we only wanted you to make\nour Christmas party complete; and I'm very glad to see you too, Mr.\nGwynne,\" continued Emma, as she held out a hand to each.\n\n\"We had some difficulty in persuading the Colonel to let us come,\"\nobserved Captain Sinclair to Mary; \"but as we have heard nothing further\nabout the Indians, he consented.\"\n\n\"You have nothing more to fear from the Indians this winter, Captain,\nand you may tell the Colonel so from me,\" said Malachi. \"I happened to\nbe on their hunting ground yesterday, and they have broken up and gone\nwestward, that is, Angry Snake and his party have; I followed their\ntrack over the snow for a few miles just to make sure; they have taken\nevery thing with them, but somehow or other, I could not find out that\nthe squaw was with them,--and they had one in their party. They carried\ntheir own packs of fur, that I'll swear to, and they had been thrown\ndown several times; which would not have been the case, if they had not\nbeen carried by men; for you see, the Injun is very impatient under a\nload, which a squaw will carry the whole day without complaining. Now\nthat party is gone, there is no other about here within fifty miles,\nI'll be bound for.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to hear you say so,\" replied Captain Sinclair.\n\n\"Then, perhaps, this poor woman whom you succored, Alfred, is the squaw\nbelonging to the party,\" observed Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell then\nrelated to Malachi Bone what had occurred on the day before; how the\nhunting party had brought home the woman, whom he pointed to in the\ncorner where she had remained unnoticed by the visitors.\n\nMalachi and the Strawberry went up to her; the Strawberry spoke to her\nin the Indian tongue in a low voice, and the woman replied in the same,\nwhile Malachi stood over them and listened.\n\n\"It's just as you thought, sir; she belongs to the Angry Snake, and she\nsays that he has gone with his party to the westward, as the beaver were\nvery scarce down here; I could have told him that. She confirms my\nstatement, that all the Indians are gone, but are to meet at the same\nplace in the spring, to hold a council.\"\n\n\"Is she of the same tribe as the Strawberry?\" inquired Henry.\n\n\"That's as may be,\" replied Malachi; \"I hardly know which tribe the\nStrawberry belongs to.\"\n\n\"But they speak the same language.\"\n\n\"Yes; but the Strawberry learned the tongue from me,\" replied Malachi.\n\n\"From you!\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"how was that?\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, it's about thirteen or fourteen years back, that I happened\nto come in upon a skirmish which took place on one of the small lakes\nbetween one of the tribes here and a war party of Hurons who were out.\nThey were surprised by the Hurons, and every soul, as far as I could\nlearn, was either scalped or carried away prisoner. The Hurons had gone\nabout an hour or two, when I came up to the place where they fought, and\nI sat down looking at the dead bodies, and thinking to myself what\ncreatures men were to deface God's image in that way, when I saw under a\nbush two little sharp eyes looking at me; at first, I thought it was\nsome beast, a lynx, mayhap, as they now call them, and I pointed my\nrifle toward it; but before I pulled the trigger, I thought that perhaps\nI might be mistaken, so I walked up to the bush, and there I discovered\nthat it was an Indian child, which had escaped the massacre by hiding\nitself in the bush. I pulled it out; it was a girl about two years old,\nwho could speak but a few words. I took her home to my lodge, and have\nhad her with me ever since, so I don't exactly know what tribe she\nbelongs to, as they all speak the same tongue. I called her the\n'Strawberry,' because I found her under a bush close to the ground, and\namong strawberry plants which were growing there.\"\n\n\"And then you married her,\" said Percival.\n\n\"Married her! no, boy, I never married her; what has an old man of near\nseventy to do with marrying? They call her my squaw, because they\nsuppose she is my wife, and she does the duty of a wife to me; but if\nthey were to call her my daughter, they would be nearer the mark, for I\nhave been a father to her.\"\n\n\"Well, Malachi, to tell you the truth, I did think that she was too\nyoung to be your wife,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Well, miss, you were not far wrong,\" replied the old man. \"I do wish I\ncould find out her tribe, but I never have been able, and indeed, from\nwhat I can learn, the party who were surprised came a long way from\nthis, although speaking the same language; and I don't think there is\nany chance now, for even if I were to try to discover it, there have\nbeen so many surprises and so much slaughter within these last twenty\nyears, that it's scarcely possible the search would be attended with\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"But why do you wish to find out her tribe?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Because I'm an old man, miss, and must soon expect to be gathered to my\nfathers, and then this poor little girl will be quite alone, unless I\ncan marry her to some one before I die: and if I do marry her, why then\nshe will leave _me_ alone; but that can't be helped, I'm an old man, and\nwhat does it matter?\"\n\n\"It matters a great deal, Malachi,\" said Mr. Campbell; \"I wish you would\nlive with us; you would then be taken care of if you required it, and\nnot die alone in the wilderness.\"\n\n\"And the Strawberry shall never want friends or a home, while we can\noffer her one, Malachi,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"let what will happen to\nyou, she will be welcome to live here and die here, if she will remain.\"\n\nMalachi made no reply; he was in deep thought, resting his chin upon his\nhands, which held his rifle before him. Mrs. Campbell and the girls were\nobliged to leave to prepare the dinner. John had sat down with the\nStrawberry and the Indian woman, and was listening to them, for he now\nunderstood the Chippeway tongue. Alfred, Sinclair, and the other\ngentlemen of the party, were in conversation near the fire, when they\nwere requested by Mrs. Campbell to retreat to the sitting-room, that the\nculinary operations might not be interfered with. Malachi Bone still\ncontinued sitting where he was, in deep thought. Martin, who remained,\nsaid to the Miss Percivals in a low voice--\n\n\"Well, I really did think that the old man had married the girl, and I\nthought it was a pity,\" continued he, looking toward the Strawberry,\n\"for she is very young and very handsome for a squaw.\"\n\n\"I think,\" replied Mary Percival, \"she would be considered handsome\neverywhere, Martin, squaw or not; her features are very pretty, and then\nshe has a melancholy smile, which is perfectly beautiful; but now,\nMartin, pluck these turkeys, or we shall not have them ready in time.\"\n\nAs soon as the dinner was at the fire, and could be left to the care of\nMartin, Mrs. Campbell and the Misses Percival went into the\nsitting-room. Mr. Campbell then read the morning service of the day,\nHenry officiating as clerk in the responses. Old Malachi had joined the\nparty, and was profoundly attentive. As soon as the service was over, he\nsaid--\n\n\"All this puts me in mind of days long past, days which appear to me as\na dream, when I was a lad and had a father and a mother, and brothers\nand sisters around me; but many summers and many winters have passed\nover my head since then.\"\n\n\"You were born in Maine, Malachi, were you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, half way up the White Mountains. He was a stern old man, my\nfather; but he was a righteous man. I remember how holy Sunday was kept\nin our family; how my mother cleaned us all, and put on our best\nclothes, and how we went to the chapel or church, I forget which they\ncalled it; but no matter, we went to pray.\"\n\n\"Was your father of the Established Church, Malachi?\"\n\n\"I can't tell, ma'am; indeed, I hardly know what it means; but he was a\ngood Christian and a good man, that I do know.\"\n\n\"You are right, Malachi; when the population is crowded, you find people\ndivided into sects, and, what is still worse, despising, if not hating\neach other, because the outward forms of worship are a little different.\nHere in our isolated position, we feel how trifling are many of the\ndistinctions which divide religious communities, and that we could\ngladly give the right hand of fellowship to any denomination of\nChristians who hold the main truths of the Gospel. Are not all such\nagreed in things essential, animated with the same hopes, acknowledging\nthe same rule of faith, and all comprehended in the same divine mercy\nwhich was shown us on this day? What do all sincere Christians believe\nbut that God is holy, great, good, and merciful, that his Son died for\nus all, and that through his merits and intercession if we conform to\nhis precepts--whether members of the Church of England, or any other\ncommunion--we shall be saved and obtain the blessedness of heaven? We\nmay prefer, and reasonably prefer, our own mode of worship, believing it\nto be most edifying; but we have no right to quarrel with those who\nconscientiously differ from us about outward forms and ceremonies which\ndo not involve the spirit of Christianity.\"\n\nAfter a pause, Mary Percival said, \"Malachi, tell us more about your\nfather and your family.\"\n\n\"I have little to tell, miss; only that I now think that those were\npleasant days which then I thought irksome. My father had a large farm\nand would have had us all remain with him. In the winter we felled\ntimber, and I took quite a passion for a hunter's life; but my father\nwould not allow me to go from home, so I staid till he died, and then I\nwent away on my rambles. I left when I was not twenty years old, and I\nhave never seen my family since. I have been a hunter and a trapper, a\nguide and a soldier, and an interpreter; but for the last twenty-five\nyears I have been away from towns and cities, and have lived altogether\nin the woods. The more man lives by himself, the more he likes it, and\nyet now and then circumstances bring up the days of his youth, and make\nhim hesitate whether it be best or not to live alone.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you say that, Malachi,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"I little thought that I should ever have said it,\" replied the old man,\n\"when I first saw that girl by the side of the stream (looking at\nEmma),--then my heart yearned toward the boy; and now this meeting to\npraise God and to keep Christmas-day--all has helped.\"\n\n\"But do you not pray when you are alone?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Yes, in a manner, miss; but it's not like your prayers; the lips don't\nmove, although the heart feels. When I lie under a tree watching for the\nanimals, and I take up a leaf and examine it, I observe how curious and\nwonderful it is,--I then think that God made it, and that man could not.\nWhen I see the young grass springing up, and _how_, I know not, except\nthat it does so every year, I think of God and his mercy to the wild\nanimals in giving them food; and then the sun reminds me of God; and the\nmoon, and the stars, as I watch, make me think of Him; but I feel very\noften that there is something wanting, and that I do not worship exactly\nas I ought to do. I never have known which is Sunday, although I well\nrecollect how holy it was kept at my father's house; and I never should\nhave known that this was Christmas-day, had it not been that I had met\nwith you. All days are alike to a man who is alone and in the\nwilderness, and that should not be--I feel that it should not.\"\n\n\"So true is it,\" observed Mr. Campbell, \"that stated times and seasons\nare necessary for the due observance of our religious duties; and I am\nglad to hear Malachi say this, as I trust it will occasion his being\nwith us more than he has been.\"\n\n\"Come to us every Sunday, Malachi,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"I think I will, ma'am, if I can--indeed, why I say _if I can_, I know\nnot; it was wrong to say so.\"\n\n\"I wish you to come not only on your own account, but for John's sake;\nsuppose you agree to come every Sunday morning, and leave us every\nMonday. You will then have the whole week for your hunting.\"\n\n\"Please God, I will,\" replied Malachi.\n\n\"And bring the Strawberry with you,\" said Mary.\n\n\"I will, miss; it can not but do her good.\"\n\nDinner was now announced, and they all sat down, a happy party. Mr.\nCampbell on this occasion produced two or three bottles of his small\nstore of wine, which he kept rather in case of illness than for any\nother reason, for they had all been so long without wine or spirits,\nthat they cared little about it. Their dinner consisted of white fish\n(salted), roast venison, boiled salt beef, roast turkey, and a\nplum-pudding, and they were all very merry, although they were in the\nwoods of Canada, and not at Wexton Hall.\n\n\"My children,\" said Mr. Campbell, after dinner. \"I now drink all your\nhealths, and wish you as much happiness as the world affords, and at the\nsame time accept my most hearty thanks and my dearest love. You have all\nbeen good, obedient, and cheerful, and have lightened many a heavy load.\nIf when it pleased Providence to send us into this wilderness, it had\nbeen part of my lot to contend with willful and disobedient children; if\nthere had been murmuring and repining at our trials; discontent and\nquarreling among yourselves, how much more painful would have been our\nsituation. On the contrary, by your good humor and attention, your\nwilling submission to privations, and your affectionate conduct toward\nme, my wife, and each other, you have not allowed us to feel the change\nof position to which we have been reduced. I say again, my dear children\nall, you have my thanks, and may the Almighty bless and preserve you!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nWhen we left off our narrative, our Canadian settlers were enjoying\nthemselves on Christmas day. On the following morning, Malachi Bone, the\nStrawberry, and John, set off for their abode to the westward, and\nCaptain Sinclair and his companion went back to the fort. The Indian\nwoman was better, and the family resumed their usual occupations. We\nmust now briefly narrate a few events which occurred during the\nremainder of the long winter. Malachi and John made their appearance,\naccompanied by the Strawberry, almost every Sunday, and the old hunter\nappeared gradually to become more reconciled to the society of others,\nand sometimes would remain for a day or two over the Sunday. The Indian\nwoman, in the course of three weeks, was quite recovered, and signified,\nthrough the Strawberry, her wish to leave, and join her tribe. To this,\nof course, no objection was raised; and having received a supply of\nprovisions, she took her leave at the latter end of the month of\nJanuary.\n\nFebruary,--March followed, and the winter still continued, but the sun\nbecame more powerful, and the weather was not so severe. It was not till\nthe middle of April that the lake was clear of ice and the thaw\ncommenced, and then it was so rapid, that the little stream became quite\nan impetuous torrent, and a large portion of the prairie land was under\nwater. A few days, however, sufficed to change the scene; the snow,\nwhich had covered the ground for so many months, had all disappeared;\nthe birds, which had been mute or had migrated during the winter, now\nmade their appearance, and chirped and twittered round the house; the\npleasant green of the prairie was once more presented to their view,\nand nature began to smile again. Other ten days passed, and the trees\nhad thrown out their leaves, and after one or two storms, the weather\nbecame warm and the sky serene.\n\nGreat was the delight of the whole party at this change; and now the\ncows were put out to their pasture, and Emma and Mary went milking as\nbefore, no longer afraid of meeting with the wolves. The boat was\nlaunched, and Percival and John went out to procure fish. Alfred, Henry,\nand Martin were very busy picking up the cleared ground, to sow the\nfirst crop. Mr. Campbell worked all day in the garden; the poultry were\nnoisy and bustling, and soon furnished an abundant supply of eggs; and\nas now the hunting season was over for a time, Malachi and the\nStrawberry were continually coming to visit them.\n\n\"Oh! how delightful this is,\" exclaimed Emma, as she stopped at the\nbridge and looked on the wide blue lake; \"is it not, Mary, after having\nbeen cooped up for so many weary months?\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, Emma; I do not wonder at your flow of spirits; I feel\nquite another person myself. Well, if the winter is long and dreary, at\nall events, it doubly enhances the value of the spring.\"\n\n\"I think it very odd that Captain Sinclair has not come to see us; don't\nyou, Mary?\"\n\n\"I certainly did expect him before this,\" replied Mary; \"I presume,\nhowever, his duty will not permit him to come.\"\n\n\"Surely he could get leave, now that the weather is fine; there was some\nreason for his not coming during the winter. I hope he is not ill.\"\n\n\"I hope so too, most sincerely, Emma,\" replied Mary; \"but come, sister,\nwe must not loiter; hear how the calves are bleating for us to let them\nhave their breakfast; we shall have more of them very soon; yes, and\nplenty of milk, and then we shall have plenty of churning; but I like\nwork when the weather is fine.\"\n\nAfter breakfast, Emma expressed her surprise to Alfred at Captain\nSinclair's not having made his appearance, and her fear that he was not\nwell. Alfred, at her request, promised to walk to the fort in the\nafternoon, and ascertain how matters were.\n\nJohn, who had not forgotten the advice of Malachi, brought in a basket\nof fine trout from the stream almost every day, and the supply of fish\nand eggs proved very acceptable, for the beef had all been consumed, and\nthe family would otherwise have been reduced to salt-pork.\n\nAlfred, as he had promised Emma, set off for the fort, accompanied by\nMartin. He returned the next morning, full of news. Captain Sinclair\nwas, as Emma had imagined, unable to come, having had a severe fall, by\nwhich he had injured his knee, and was laid up for a time; he was,\nhowever, in very good spirits, and the medical officer had promised that\nhe should be well again in a fortnight; he sent his kind regards to all\nthe family. The commandant also sent his compliments to Mr. Campbell,\nand desired to acquaint him that, in a week or ten days, it was his\nintention to send a boat to Montreal, and if Mr. Campbell had any\npurchases to make, or wished to send any one by the opportunity, he\nmight do so, and the boat would bring back the articles he required.\nThey had no further communication with Quebec, but expected a runner to\ncome every day with the letters from England and newspapers; and\nfurther, that he hoped soon to be able to pay his respects in person.\n\nSuch was the information brought by Alfred; Emma made many inquiries\nrelative to Captain Sinclair as Mary stood by, and Alfred laughed at her\nextreme inquisitiveness. The proposition of the commandant relative to\nthe trip to Montreal was then discussed. Old Malachi had several\npackages of furs to dispose of. Martin had five, Alfred three, and Henry\ntwo; for, although we made no mention of it, on their hunting\nexcursions, whoever killed the animal, was entitled to the skin. The\npackages of Malachi were, however, of some value, as he had many beaver\nand other skins, while those of Martin and the others consisted chiefly\nof deer-skins. The question was, whom to send down with them. Malachi\nwas not inclined to go, Martin could not well be spared, and, moreover,\nwould very probably get into some scrape if he went to Montreal; whereas\nHenry and Alfred did not know any thing about the value of skins;\notherwise, Mr. Campbell, who wished to purchase flour and pork, besides\nseveral other articles, would have preferred sending one of them. But\nthe difficulty was soon removed by old Malachi, who observed, that he\nhad made a valuation of his skins, and that the others could be valued\nalso before they were packed up; and that if not sold for what they\nought to fetch, or nearly so, they had better be brought back. Mr.\nCampbell was satisfied with this arrangement, and Henry was appointed to\nundertake the journey. Mr. Campbell made out his inventory of articles;\nMrs. Campbell added her list, and all was ready as soon as they received\nnotice that the boat was to leave. Martin did not appear at all annoyed\nat not being selected for the expedition; since Malachi Bone had\ninformed them that the Strawberry was not his wife, as they had\nsupposed, Martin was continually by her side. She began to speak a few\nwords of English, and had become a great favorite with every body.\n\nMr. Campbell, as soon as he perceived that Malachi no longer avoided\nthem, thought it but his duty to offer him his land back again, but\nMalachi would not consent to accept it. He said he did not want the\nland, although perhaps, he might raise his lodge a little nearer to them\nthan it was; at present, things had better remain as they were; after\nwhich Mr. Campbell did not renew the subject. Malachi soon acted upon\nhis remark, that perhaps he might raise his lodge a little nearer, for,\na few days afterward, he made his appearance with the Strawberry and\nJohn, all three loaded with his household utensils, and in a very short\ntime he had erected another wigwam within sight of the house at the\nwestern end of Mr. Campbell's prairie. This gave great satisfaction to\nMrs. Campbell, because John was now always near them; indeed, he no\nlonger slept in the lodge, but at the house, in the room with his\nbrothers. The major part of the day he passed at the lodge, or in\ncompany with the old hunter; but, by this new arrangement, they\ngradually became, as it were, one family; not a day passed that the\nStrawberry did not come to their house and make herself useful,\nassisting in every thing that she could, and rapidly learning what she\ndid not know.\n\nOne or two evenings after the message from the fort, Mrs. Campbell asked\nMalachi some questions relative to the habits of the beaver, as she had\nheard much of the sagacity of that animal.\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" said Malachi, \"it's a most reasonable animal, certainly,\nand I will say, I never was tired with watching them; I've even forgot,\nin the summer-time, what I came out for, from having fallen in with them\nat work.\"\n\n\"And so have I,\" said Martin. \"I once was lying down under a bush by the\nside of a stream, and I saw a whole council of them meet together, and\nthey talked after their own fashion so earnestly, and I really think\nthey have a language as good as our own. It's always the old ones who\ntalk, and the young ones who listen.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" replied Malachi. \"I once myself saw them hold a council,\nand then they all separated to go to work, for they were about to dam up\na stream and build their lodges.\"\n\n\"And what did they do, Malachi?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Why, ma'am, they did all the same as Christians would have done. The\nInjuns say that beavers have souls as well as themselves, and certainly,\nif sense gave souls, the Injuns would be in the right. The first thing\nthat they did was to appoint their sentinels to give notice of danger;\nfor the moment any one comes near them, these sentinels give the signal\nand away they all dive, and disappear till the danger is over.\"\n\n\"There are many beasts as well as birds that do the same,\" observed Mr.\nCampbell; \"indeed, most of those which are gregarious and live in\nflocks.\"\n\n\"That's true, sir,\" replied Martin.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, the beavers choose a place fit for their work. What they\nrequire is a stream running through a flat or bottom, which stream of\nwater they may dam up so as to form a large pond of a sufficient depth\nby the water flowing over and covering the flat or bottom several feet;\nand when they have found the spot they require, they begin their work.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" observed Mr. Campbell, \"this choice requires more sagacity\nthan the rest of their labor, for the beavers must have some engineering\ntalent to make the selection. They must be able to calculate as exactly\nas if they took their levels, to secure the size and depth of water in\nthe pond which is necessary. It is the most wonderful, perhaps, of all\nthe instincts, or reasoning powers rather, allotted to them.\"\n\n\"It is, sir; and I've often thought so,\" replied Malachi; \"and then to\nsee how they carry all their tools about them; a carpenter's basket\ncould not be better provided. Their strong teeth serve as axes to cut\ndown the trees; then their tails serve as trowels for their mason's\nwork; their fore-feet they use just as we do our hands, and their tails\nare also employed as little carts or wheelbarrows.\"\n\n\"Pray go on, Malachi,\" said Mary; \"I am quite interested already.\"\n\n\"Well, miss, I have known these little creatures as they are, raise\nbanks four or five hundred paces in length, and a matter of twenty feet\nhigh in some parts, besides being seven or eight feet thick; and all in\none season,--perhaps five or six months' work.\"\n\n\"But how many of them do you reckon are at the work?\" said Henry.\n\n\"Perhaps a hundred; not more, I should say.\"\n\n\"Well; but how do they raise these banks, Malachi?\" said Emma.\n\n\"There, miss, they show what sense they have. I've often watched them\nwhen they have been sawing through the large trees with the front teeth;\nthey could not carry the tree, that's sartin, if the whole of them were\nto set to work, so they always pick out the trees by the banks of the\nstream, and they examine how the trees incline, to see if they will fall\ninto the stream; if not, they will not cut them down; and when they are\ncutting them down, and they are nearly ready for falling, if the wind\nshould change and be against the fall, they will leave that tree till\nthe wind will assist them. As soon as the trees are down, they saw off\nthe branches and arms, and float the log down to where the dam is to be\nmade; they lay them across, and as they lay them one upon the other, of\ncourse the water rises and enables them to float down and place the\nupper ones. But before that, as soon as the lower logs are in their\nplaces, the animals go and fetch long grass and clay, which they load\nupon their flat tails, and drag to the dam, filling up the holes between\nthe timber till it is as strong as a wall, and the water is completely\nstopped.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Martin; \"I have heard them at night working away so hard and\nflapping and spattering with their tails, that I could imagine there\nwere fifty men at work instead of a hundred of these small animals, but\nthey work by day and by night, and never seem tired, till the dam is\nsound and their work is complete.\"\n\n\"But the raising of the dam is only preparatory, is it not, to their\nbuilding their own houses?\" observed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Nothing more, ma'am; and I think the rest of the work is quite as\nwonderful.\"\n\n\"But it is time to go to bed,\" observed Mr. Campbell, \"and we must,\ntherefore, leave the remainder of Malachi's story till another evening.\"\n\n\"I am sure that there is not one of the party who is more anxious to\nhear it than I am,\" replied Mrs. Campbell, rising, \"but as you say, it\nis past ten o'clock, and Malachi and the Strawberry have to go home, so\ngood-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! what a pity!\" cried Percival, \"I shall dream of beavers all\nnight, I'm sure I shall.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nFor two or three days, Mr. Campbell was very busy making out an\ninventory of the articles which he required. His funds at Quebec were\nrather low, but the communication which his agent had made to him of Mr.\nD. Campbell's intention of paying for the green-house and hot-house\nplants, made him feel very easy on that score; and he now determined to\nprocure a small flock of sheep, and one or two of the Canadian ponies\nor galloways, as they would soon be required for the farm, as well as\ntwo carts or light wagons used in the country. In the meantime, Alfred,\nMartin, and Henry were very busy putting the seed in between the stumps\nof the felled timber, merely hoeing up the earth and raking it in, which\nwas all that was required. The quantity of land cleared was about twelve\nacres, half of which was sowed with oats, and the other with wheat; the\npiece cleared on the other side of the stream by Malachi Bone, and\nrailed in, was sown with maize, or Indian corn. As soon as the seed was\nin, they all set to putting up a high fence round the cleared land,\nwhich was done with split rails made from the white cedar, which grew in\na swamp about half a mile distant, and which, it may be remembered, had\nin a great measure been provided by the soldiers who had been lent to\nassist them on their arrival. The piece of prairie land, on the side of\nthe stream next to the house, was put apart for an early crop of hay,\nand as soon as they could, they intended to turn the cows into the bush,\nthat is, to feed in the forest, that they might obtain hay from the\nother side, which had belonged to Malachi; but the prairie required to\nbe fenced in, and this was the job that they took in hand as soon as the\nseeds were sown.\n\n\"I hope, when the Colonel comes over,\" observed Martin to Alfred, \"that\nwe shall persuade him to let us have some soldiers this summer, for we\nshall want them both for the fencing and getting the hay-crop in. Our\nsummers are not very long, and there is plenty to do.\"\n\n\"I think my father intends to make the request,\" replied Alfred.\n\n\"Ah, sir; he will now see the value of this bit of prairie land to a new\nsettler; instead of having to go in search of hay, as they must do at\nthe fort now, we have plenty for hay, and plenty for feed. So we are to\nhave some sheep, I find?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I suppose we must build a winter-yard for them.\"\n\n\"To be sure we must, for the wolves are very partial to mutton; I think,\non the whole, that they like pigs better. I wish we could get the fence\nup round the prairie, but that we never can do this year without we\nhave help from the fort.\"\n\n\"But will it be safe to turn the cows into the bush?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir; they will not be hurt by any thing in the summer time;\nsometimes we have trouble to find them again, but not when they have\ncalves; they are certain to come home every evening to their young\nones.\"\n\n\"We shall have quite a herd of cattle; eight calves and eight cows.\"\n\n\"We must only bring up the cow calves, unless your father intends to\nhave oxen for the yoke. We shall require them about the time they are\nfit to break in, that is, in two or three years.\"\n\n\"Yes, we shall be great farmers by and by,\" replied Alfred with a sigh;\nfor at the moment he was thinking of Captain Lumley and his nautical\nprofession.\n\nIn the evening of the day on which this conversation took place, Malachi\nBone was requested to resume his observations upon the beavers.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, as I said the other night, as soon as they have dammed up\nthe river and made the lake, they then build their houses; and how they\nmanage to work under water and fix the posts in the ground is a puzzle\nto me, but they do fix six posts in the ground, and very firmly, and\nthen they build their house, which is very curious; it is in the form of\na large oven, and made of clay and fat earth, mixed up with branches and\nherbs of all sorts; they have three sets of rooms, one above the other,\nso that if the water rises from a freshet or sudden thaw, they may be\nable to move higher and keep themselves dry. Each beaver has his own\nlittle room, and the entrance is made under the water, so that they dive\ndown to go into it, and nothing can harm them.\"\n\n\"How very curious! and what do they live upon? Malachi?\"\n\n\"The bark of what we call asp-wood, ma'am, which is a kind of sallow;\nthey lay up great quantities of it in the autumn as a provision for\nwinter, when they are frozen up for some months.\"\n\n\"Well, but how do you take them, Malachi?\"\n\n\"There are many ways, ma'am; sometimes the Indians break down the dam,\nand let off the water, and then they kill them all except a dozen of the\nfemales and half a dozen males; after which they stop up the dam again,\nthat the animals may breed and increase; sometimes, when the beaver lake\nis frozen hard, they break into the beaver house from the top; when they\ndo that, the beavers all dive and escape, but as they must come up to\nbreathe at the holes in the ice, they place nets and take them in that\nway, but they always leave a sufficient number to keep up the stock;\nthey also take them in traps baited with the asp-wood; but that is more\ndifficult.\n\n\"But there is another sort of beaver, ma'am, called the land-beaver,\nwhich is more easily taken,\" observed Martin; \"they make holes in the\nearth like rabbits. The Indians say that these beavers are those who are\nlazy and idle, and have been driven out by the others for not working.\"\n\n\"Now, tell us what you do when you go out to hunt the beaver in the\nwinter, Malachi?\"\n\n\"We never hunt the beaver only, ma'am; we go out to hunt every thing; we\ngo to the beaver lakes, and then we set our traps for beaver, otter,\nmartin, minks, cats, foxes, and every other animal, some traps large and\nsome small. We build our hut, and set our traps all about us, and\nexamine them every day; we cut what flesh is good, and we employ\nourselves skinning the animals which we take.\"\n\n\"Is the beaver flesh good?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, very tolerable eating; perhaps the best we find at that\ntime.\"\n\n\"But what a miserable life that must be,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, you may think so, but we hunters think otherwise,\" replied\nMalachi; \"we are used to it, and to being left alone to our own\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" observed Martin; \"I'd rather pass the winter hunting\nbeavers, than pass it at Quebec, miserable as you may imagine the life\nto be.\"\n\n\"There must be a charm in the life, that is certain,\" observed Mr.\nCampbell; \"for how many are engaged in it who go out year after year,\nand never think of laying up any of their earnings.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir,\" replied Martin; \"what they make from their skins is\nspent as soon as they get to Quebec, as I know well, and then they set\noff again.\"\n\n\"Why they are like sailors,\" observed Alfred, \"who, after a long cruise,\nspend all their wages and prize-money in a few days, and then go to sea\nagain for more.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Malachi; \"and what's the use of money if you keep it?\nA trapper can always take up as much powder and ball as he wants upon\ncredit, and pay with a portion of his skins on his return. What does he\nwant with the rest? It's of no use to him, and so of course he spends\nit.\"\n\n\"But would it not be better to put it by until he had sufficient to buy\na farm, and live comfortably?\"\n\n\"But does he live comfortably, ma'am?\" said Malachi; \"has he not more\nwork to do, more things to look after, and more to care for with a farm,\nthan when he has nothing?\"\n\n\"It's very true philosophy, after all,\" observed Mr. Campbell; \"happy is\nthe man who is content to be poor. If a man prefers to live entirely\nupon flesh, as the hunters do, there is no reason why he should work\nhard and till the ground to procure bread; when the wants are few, the\ncares are few also; but still, even the savage must feel the necessity\nof exertion when he has a wife and family.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, to be sure he does, and he works hard in his own way to\nprocure their food; but trappers seldom have wives; they would be no use\nto them in the woods, and they have no one to provide for but\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"It appears to me like a savage life, but a very independent one,\" said\nMrs. Campbell, \"and I presume it is the independence which gives it such\ncharms.\"\n\n\"That's it, depend upon it, ma'am,\" replied Martin.\n\n\"But what do you do all the summer time, Malachi?\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, we take to our rifles then; there are the deer, and the\nlynx, and the wild cats, and squirrels, and the bear, and many other\nanimals to look after; and sometimes we go bee-hunting, for the honey.\"\n\n\"Pray tell us how you take the honey, Malachi.\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, the bees always live in the hollow of the old trees, and\nit's very difficult in a forest to find them out, for the hole which\nthey enter by is very small and very high up sometimes; however, when we\nget a lead, we generally manage it.\"\n\n\"Tell us what you mean, Malachi.\"\n\n\"We catch the bees as they settle upon the flowers to obtain honey, and\nthen we let them go again. The bee, as soon as it is allowed to escape,\nflies straight toward its hive; we watch it till we can no longer see\nit, and walk in that direction and catch another, and so we go on till\nwe see them settle upon a tree, and then we know that the hive and honey\nmust be in that tree, so we cut it down.\"\n\n\"How very clever,\" said Percival.\n\n\"It requires a sharp eye though,\" said Martin, \"to watch the bee far;\nsome of the trappers catch the bees and give them sugar mixed with\nwhisky. This makes them tipsy, and they can not fly so fast, and then\nthey discover the hive much sooner, as they can run almost as fast as\nthe bee flies.\"\n\n\"That's capital,\" cried Percival; \"but tell me, Martin, how do you kill\nthe bears?\"\n\n\"Why, Master Percival, with our rifles, to be sure; the easiest way to\nkill them is when they are in their holes in the hollow trees.\"\n\n\"How do you get them out?\"\n\n\"Why, we knock the tree with our axes, and they come out to see what's\nthe matter, and as soon as they put their heads out, we shoot them.\"\n\n\"Are you in earnest, Martin?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; quite in earnest,\" replied Martin.\n\n\"It's all true, ma'am,\" said the hunter; \"the bears about here are not\nvery savage. We had much worse down in Maine. I've seen the Indians in a\ncanoe on a river watching the bears as they swam across, and kill in the\nwater six or seven in one day.\"\n\n\"Still a bear is an awkward sort of animal when it's angry,\" replied\nMartin; \"and, as we may have them down here in the autumn, it's as well\nnot to let them be thought too lightly of.\"\n\n\"Indeed, there's no fear of that,\" said Emma; \"as for Malachi, he\nthinks nothing dangerous; but I have no wish to see a bear. You say we\nmay expect them, Martin. Why so?\"\n\n\"Because, miss, they are very fond of maize, and we have a field of it\nsown, which may tempt them.\"\n\n\"Well, if they do come, I must trust to my rifle,\" replied Emma,\nlaughing; \"at all events, I do not fear them so much as I did when I\nfirst came here.\"\n\n\"Don't fire, miss, without you're sure of killing,\" said Malachi. \"The\ncreatures are very dangerous when wounded.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid; I'll only fire in self-defense, Malachi; that is, when\nI have no other chance left. I had rather trust to my heels than my\nrifle. Were you ever hugged by a bear?\"\n\n\"Well, I wasn't ever hugged; but once I was much closer to one than ever\nI wish to be again.\"\n\n\"Oh! when was that? Do, pray, tell us,\" said Emma.\n\n\"It was when I was young, that one day I sounded a tree in the forest\nwith my ax, and I was certain that a bear was in it: but the animal did\nnot show itself, so I climbed up the tree to examine the hole at the\ntop, and see if the bear was at home; as, if so, I was determined to\nhave him out. Well, miss, I was on the top of the hollow trunk, and was\njust putting my head down into the hole, when, all of a sudden, the edge\nof the tree which I kneeled upon gave way, like so much tinder, and down\nI went into the hollow; luckily for me I did not go down head foremost,\nor there I should have remained till this time, for the hole in the\nmiddle of the tree, as I found, was too narrow for me to have turned in,\nand there I must have stuck. As it was, I went down with the dust and\ncrumbles smothering me almost, till I came right on the top of the bear,\nwho lay at the bottom, and I fell with such force, that I doubled his\nhead down so that he could not lay hold of me with his teeth, which\nwould not have been pleasant; indeed, the bear was quite as much, if not\nmore astonished than myself, and there he lay beneath me, very quiet,\ntill I could recover a little. Then I thought of getting out, as you may\nsuppose, fast enough, and the hollow of the tree, providentially, was\nnot so wide but that I could work up again with my back to one side and\nmy knees to the other. By this means I gradually got up again to the\nhole that I fell in at, and perched myself across the timber to fetch my\nbreath. I had not been there more than a quarter of a minute, and I\nintended to have remained much longer, when I perceived, all of a\nsudden, the bear's head within a foot of me; he had climbed up after me,\nand I saw that he was very angry, so in a moment I threw myself off my\nperch, and down I went to the ground at the foot of the tree, a matter\nof near twenty feet, even faster than I went down inside of it. I was\nseverely shaken with the fall, but no bones were broken; in fact, I was\nmore frightened than hurt; I lay quite still for a little while, when\nthe growl of the bear put me in mind of him; I jumped on my legs, and\nfound that he was coming down the tree after me, and was within six feet\nof the ground. There was no time to lose; I caught up my rifle, and had\njust time to put it to his ear and settle him, as he was placing his\nfore-foot on the ground.\"\n\n\"What a narrow escape!\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it was, but there's no saying, miss, which beats till the\nfight is over.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nA notice arrived that the departure of the boat to Montreal would take\nplace on the next morning. When the boat came up, it brought Captain\nSinclair, to the great delight of the whole party, who had felt very\nanxious about one with whom they had so long been intimate and who had\nshown them so much kindness. His knee was almost well, and as soon as\nthe first interrogations were over, he made known to them that he had\nobtained six weeks' leave of absence, and was about to proceed to\nQuebec.\n\n\"To Quebec!\" cried Emma, \"and why are you going to Quebec?\"\n\n\"To confess the truth, Emma,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"my journey to\nQuebec is but the preparatory step to my return to England for perhaps\ntwo or three months.\"\n\n\"To England! Oh! how I wish--;\" but here Emma stopped; she was going to\nsay how much she wished that she was going also, but her uncle and aunt\nwere present, and, recollecting that it might pain them and induce them\nto think that she was discontented, she added, \"that you would bring me\nout all the new fashions.\"\n\n\"All the new fashions, my dear Emma?\" said Henry. \"Why, do you wish to\nbe fashionably dressed in the woods of Canada?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" exclaimed Emma, who felt that she must appear to be very\nfoolish, but could not get out of her scrape. \"I can look at myself in\nthe glass at all events.\"\n\n\"I will try to bring you out something which will give you pleasure,\"\nreplied Captain Sinclair, \"but as for the fashions, I know you are only\njoking, by your trusting a person so incompetent as I am to select\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not think you would execute my commission very well, so I\nwill not trouble you,\" replied Emma; \"and now let us know why you are\ngoing to England.\"\n\n\"My dear Emma,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"you ought not to put such questions;\nCaptain Sinclair has his own reasons, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"It is very true that I have my own reasons,\" replied Captain Sinclair,\n\"and, as I have no secrets, I will with pleasure gratify Emma's\ncuriosity. I do not know whether you are aware that I was an orphan at a\nvery early age, and have been under the charge of a guardian. When my\nfather died, he left directions in his will that I was not to take\npossession of my property till I was twenty-five years of age. I was\ntwenty-five years old last year, and my guardian has written requesting\nme to come home, that he may be relieved of his responsibility, by\nmaking over to me the trust which has been confided to him.\"\n\n\"Will it detain you long?\" inquired Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"It must not. It is very difficult to obtain leave of absence from your\nregiment in time of war. It is only through interest that I do so now.\nOn my arrival at Quebec, the Governor will put me on his staff, and\nthen he will give me leave. I shall not stay longer than is necessary,\nas I am anxious to be with my regiment again. You may, therefore, be\ncertain that, if I am spared, I shall be with you again before the\nwinter, if not much sooner. So now if you have really any commissions\nfor me to execute, I can only say I shall be most happy to comply with\nyour wishes to the best of my ability.\"\n\n\"Well,\" observed Emma, \"we really were not aware that Captain Sinclair\nwas a man of fortune. You think now you will come back,\" continued she,\ngravely, \"but if once you get to England, you will remain, and forget\nall about Canada.\"\n\n\"My fortune is not very large,\" replied Captain Sinclair; \"in England,\nhardly sufficient to induce a young lady of fashion to look upon me,\nalthough enough, perhaps, for a sensible woman to be happy upon. My\nfortune, therefore, will not detain me in England, and, as I said\nbefore, my greatest wish is to rejoin my regiment.\"\n\n\"Whether you come back or remain,\" observed Mr. Campbell, \"you will\nalways have our best wishes, Captain Sinclair. We are not ungrateful for\nyour kindness to us.\"\n\n\"Nor shall I forget the many happy hours I have passed in your society,\"\nreplied Captain Sinclair; \"but we shall be melancholy if we talk too\nlong upon the subject. The boat can not remain more than two hours, and\nHenry must be ready by that time. The commandant is anxious that it\nshould start for Montreal this very evening.\"\n\n\"Then, indeed, we have no time to lose,\" observed Mr. Campbell; \"Henry,\nget your trunk ready, and Martin will take it down into the boat before\nwe sit down to dinner. It will be a long while before we have you to\ndine with us again,\" continued Mr. Campbell to Captain Sinclair; \"but I\nwish you your health and much happiness till you return. Come, girls,\nlook after the dinner. Mary! where's Mary?\"\n\n\"She went into the room a few minutes ago,\" said Emma, \"but I'm here,\nand can do all that is required without her or my aunt either. Come,\nPercival, lay the cloth; Alfred, come and help me, this is almost too\nheavy for me. Oh, here comes my aunt: now you may go away, Alfred; we\ncan get on better without you.\"\n\n\"There's gratitude,\" said Alfred, laughing.\n\nAs Henry had been in daily expectation of the summons, he was not long\nin his preparations, and in a few minutes made his appearance,\naccompanied by Mary Percival. They then sat down to dinner, not very\ncheerful, for Captain Sinclair's unexpected departure had thrown a gloom\nover them all; however, they rallied a little toward the close of the\nmeal, and Mr. Campbell produced one of his bottles of wine to drink\nsuccess and happiness to the travelers. It was then time to start.\nCaptain Sinclair and Henry shook hands with Mr. Campbell and the Miss\nPercivals, and accompanied by the gentlemen of the party, walked down to\nthe beach.\n\n\"I can't bear parting with any one that I have been so intimate with,\"\nsaid Emma, after they were left alone. \"I declare I could sit down and\nhave a hearty cry at Captain Sinclair's departure.\"\n\nMary sighed, but made no answer.\n\n\"I am not surprised to hear you say so, Emma,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"In\nEngland, when we were surrounded with friends, parting was always\npainful; but here where we have so few, I might almost say only Captain\nSinclair, it is of course most painful. However, it's only for a time, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"It must be very dull to be on duty at the fort,\" said Mary; \"I should\nnot be surprised at Captain Sinclair's not returning.\"\n\n\"I should be most exceedingly surprised,\" replied Emma; \"I am sure that\nhe will come back, if he is not unavoidably prevented.\"\n\n\"Since he has expressed so much desire to rejoin his regiment, I should\nbe surprised as well as you, Emma,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"He is not a\nvolatile young man; but, come, we must clear away the dinner-table.\"\n\nMr. Campbell, Alfred, Percival, and Martin soon returned, for Captain\nSinclair was obliged to push off immediately, that he might return in\ntime to the fort, in obedience to his orders. Malachi and John had gone\nout on a hunting expedition, and the Strawberry was at her own lodge.\nThe party that sat in the kitchen in the evening was, therefore, much\nreduced, and the taking farewell of Captain Sinclair did not dispose\nthem to be very lively. A few words were exchanged now and then, but the\nconversation drooped. Emma spoke of Captain Sinclair's expectations and\nprojects.\n\n\"We never know what may come in this world of change, my dear Emma,\"\nsaid Mr. Campbell. \"All Captain Sinclair's plans may be overthrown by\ncircumstances over which he has no control. How seldom do we meet with\nresults equal to our expectations. When I was practicing in my\nprofession, I little expected that I should be summoned to take\npossession of Wexton Hall; when once in possession, as little did I\nexpect that I should be obliged to quit it, and to come to these\ndesolate wilds. We are in the hands of God, who does with us as He\nthinks fit. I have been reading this morning, and I made the observation\nnot only how often individuals, but even nations, are out in their\nexpectations. I do not know a more convincing proof of this than the\nnarration of events, which from their recent occurrence, can hardly yet\nbe considered as history, has offered to me. Perhaps there never was so\nshort a period in which causes have produced effects so rapidly, and in\nwhich, in every case, the effects have been directly opposite to what\nshort-sighted mortals had anticipated. It was in 1756, scarcely forty\nyears ago, that the French, being in possession of the provinces,\nattempted to wrest from us those portions of America which we occupied.\nWhat was the result? After a war which, for cruelty and atrocity, is\nperhaps unequaled in history, both parties employing savages, by whom\nthe French and English were alternately tortured and burned to death,\nFrance, in attempting to obtain all, lost all, and was compelled, in\n1760, to surrender its own provinces to Great Britain. Here is one\ninstance in which affairs turned out contrary to the expectations of\nFrance.\n\n\"Now again: At no period was England more prosperous or more respected\nby foreign nations than at the close of the war. Her prosperity made her\narrogant and unjust. She wronged her colonies. She thought that they\ndared not resist her imperious will. She imagined that now that the\nFrench were driven from the Canadas, America was all her own, whereas it\nwas because the French _were_ driven from the Canadas that the colonies\nventured to resist. As long as the French held this country, the English\ncolonists had an enemy on their frontiers, and consequently looked up to\nEngland for support and protection. They required aid and assistance,\nand as long as they did require it, they were not likely to make any\nremonstrance at being taxed to pay a portion of the expense which was\nincurred. Had the French possessed an army under Montcalm ready to\nadvance at the time that the Stamp Act, or the duty upon tea, salt,\netc., was imposed, I question very much if the colonists would have made\nany remonstrance. But no longer requiring an army for their own\nparticular defense, these same duties induced them to rise in rebellion\nagainst what they considered injustice, and eventually to assert their\nindependence. Here, again, we find that affairs turned out quite\ncontrary to the expectations of England.\n\n\"Observe again. The American colonists gained their independence, which\nin all probability they would not have done had they not been assisted\nby the numerous army and fleet of France, who, irritated at the loss of\nthe Canadas, wished to humiliate England by the loss of her own American\npossessions. But little did the French king and his noblesse imagine,\nthat in upholding the principles of the Americans, and allowing the\nFrench armies and navies (I may say the people of France _en masse_) to\nbe imbued with the same principles of equality, that they were sowing\nthe seeds of a revolution in their own country which was to bring the\nking, as well as the major part of the nobility, to the scaffold.\n\n\"There, again, the events did not turn out according to expectation, and\nyou will observe in every attempt made by either party, the result was,\nthat the blow fell upon their own heads, and not upon that of the party\nwhich it was intended to crush.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Alfred, after Mr. Campbell had finished speaking,\n\"having somewhere read a story of an Eastern king who purchased a\nproverb of a dervise, which he ordered to be engraven on all the gold\nand silver utensils in the palace. The proverb was, 'Never undertake any\nthing until you have well considered the end.' It so happened, that\nthere was a conspiracy against the king, and it was arranged that his\nsurgeon should bleed him with a poisoned lancet. The surgeon agreed--the\nking's arm was bound up, and one of the silver basins was held to\nreceive the blood. The surgeon read the inscription, and was so struck\nwith the force of it, that he threw down the lancet, confessed the plot,\nand thus was the life of the king preserved.\"\n\n\"A very apt story, Alfred,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"The question now is,\" continued Alfred, \"as two of the parties, France\nand England, have proved so short-sighted, whether the Americans, having\nthrown off their allegiance, have not been equally so in their choice of\na democratical government?\"\n\n\"How far a modern democracy may succeed, I am not prepared to say,\"\nreplied Mr. Campbell; \"but this I do know, that in ancient times, their\nduration was generally very short, and continually changing to oligarchy\nand tyranny. One thing is certain, that there is no form of government\nunder which the people become so rapidly vicious, or where those who\nbenefit them are treated with such ingratitude.\"\n\n\"How do you account for that, sir?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"There are two principal causes. One is, that where all men are declared\nto be equal (which man never will permit his fellow to be if he can\nprevent it), the only source of distinction is wealth, and thus the\ndesire of wealth becomes the ruling passion of the whole body, and there\nis no passion so demoralizing. The other is, that where the people, or,\nmore properly speaking, the mob govern, they must be conciliated by\nflattery and servility on the part of those who would become their\nidols. Now flattery is lying, and a habit equally demoralizing to the\nparty who gives and to the party who receives it. Depend upon it, there\nis no government so contemptible or so unpleasant for an honest man to\nlive under as a democracy.\"\n\n\"It is my opinion, sir, and I believe a very general one,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"How far the Americans may disprove such an opinion,\" continued Mr.\nCampbell, \"remains to be seen; but this is certain, they have commenced\ntheir new form of government with an act of such gross injustice, as to\nwarrant the assumption that all their boasted virtues are pretense. I\nrefer to their not liberating their slaves. They have given the lie to\ntheir own assertions in their Declaration of Independence, in which they\nhave declared all men equal and born free, and we can not expect the\nDivine blessing upon those who, when they emancipated themselves, were\nso unjust as to hold their fellow-creatures in bondage. The time will\ncome, I have no doubt, although perhaps not any of us here present may\nsee the day, when the retribution will fall upon their heads, or rather\nupon the heads of their offspring; for the sins of the fathers are\nvisited upon the children, even to the third and fourth generation. But\nit is time for us to think of retiring--good-night, and God bless you\nall.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nIn two days Malachi and John returned, bringing with them the skins of\nthree bears which they had killed--but at this period of the year the\nanimals were so thin and so poor, that their flesh was not worth\nbringing home. Indeed, it was hardly worth while going out to hunt just\nthen, so they both remained much at home, either fishing in the lake, or\ntaking trout in the stream. Alfred and Martin were still occupied with\nthe farm; the seed had come up, and they were splitting rails for the\nprairie fence. About a fortnight after Captain Sinclair's departure,\nColonel Forster came in a boat from the fort, to pay them a visit.\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Campbell,\" said he, \"I was very anxious about you\nlast winter, and I am rejoiced that you got over it with so little\ndifficulty. At one time we had apprehensions of the Indians, but these\nhave passed over for the present. They meet again this summer, but the\nQuebec government are on the alert, and I have no doubt but that a\nlittle conciliation will put an end to all animosity. We expect a large\nsupply of blankets and other articles to be sent up this spring, as\npresents to the tribes, which we hope will procure their good-will; and\nwe have taken up several French emissaries, who were working mischief.\"\n\n\"But still we shall be liable to the assaults of straggling parties,\"\nsaid Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"That is true,\" replied the Colonel, \"but against them you have your own\nmeans of defense. You would, in so isolated a position, be equally\nliable to a burglary in England--only with the difference that in\nEngland you would have the laws to appeal to, whereas here you must take\nthe law into your own hands.\"\n\n\"It certainly is not pleasant to be in a continual state of anxiety,\"\nobserved Mr. Campbell, \"but we knew what we had to expect before we came\nhere, and we must make the best of it. So you have lost Captain\nSinclair, Colonel; he is a great loss to us.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is to go to England for a short time,\" replied the Colonel,\n\"but we shall soon have him back again. He must be very fond of his\nprofession to remain in it with his means.\"\n\n\"He told us that he was about to take possession of a small property.\"\n\n\"A property of nearly £2,000 per annum,\" replied the Colonel. \"He may\nconsider it a small property, but I should think it otherwise if it had\nfallen to my lot.\"\n\n\"Indeed I had no idea, from what he said, that it was so large,\" said\nMrs. Campbell. \"Well, I have a high opinion of him, and have no doubt\nbut that he will make a good use of it.\"\n\n\"At all events, he can afford the luxury of a wife,\" said the Colonel,\nlaughing, \"which we soldiers seldom can.\"\n\nThe Colonel then entered into conversation with Mr. Campbell, relative\nto his farm, and after many questions, he observed:\n\n\"I have been thinking, Mr. Campbell, that it will be very advantageous\nto the government as well as to you, when your farm is cleared and\nstocked, if, with the water-power you possess here, you were to erect a\nflour-mill and a saw-mill. You observe that the government has to supply\nthe fort with flour and provisions of all kinds at a very heavy expense\nof carriage, and the cattle we have at the fort will cost us more than\nthey are worth, now that we have lost your prairie farm, so conveniently\nsituated for us. On the other hand, your produce will be almost useless\nto you, at the distance you are from any mart; as you will not find any\nsale for it. Now, if you were to erect a mill, and grind your own wheat,\nwhich you may do in another year, if you have funds sufficient; and as\nyou may have plenty of stock, you will be able to supply the fort with\nflour, beef, pork, and mutton, at a good profit to yourself, and at\none-half the price which government pays at present. I have written to\nthe Governor on the subject, stating that we have not the means of\nkeeping our stock, and pointing out to him what I now point out to you.\nI expect an answer in a few days, and should he authorize me, I may make\narrangements with you even now, which will be satisfactory, I have no\ndoubt.\"\n\nMr. Campbell returned the Colonel many thanks for his kindness, and of\ncourse expressed himself willing to be guided by his advice. He stated\nthat he had funds not only sufficient to erect a mill, but also, if he\nwere permitted, to pay for the labor of any party of men which the\ncommandant would spare during the summer season.\n\n\"That is the very point which I wished to ascertain; but I felt some\ndelicacy about making the inquiry. Now I consider that there will be no\ndifficulty in our arrangements.\"\n\nThe Colonel remained for some time looking over the farm and conversing\nwith Mr. Campbell, and then took his leave.\n\nIn the meantime, Alfred and his cousins went out to walk; the weather\nwas now beautifully clear, and in the afternoon the heat was not too\noppressive. As they sauntered by the side of the stream, Mary said,\n\"Well, Alfred, what do you think of the Colonel's proposition?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" observed Emma, \"you are a party deeply concerned in it.\"\n\n\"How so, dear coz?\"\n\n\"Why, don't you perceive that if the mill is erected, you will be the\nproper person to have charge of it? What a change of professions, from a\nsailor to a miller. I think I see you in your coat, all white with\nflour, coming in to dinner.\"\n\n\"My dear Emma, you don't intend it, I am sure, but you do not know that\nyou are inflicting pain upon me. When the Colonel made the proposition,\nI felt the importance of it, as it would be a source of great profit to\nmy father; but at the same time, I don't know how it is, I have always\nindulged the idea that we may not stay here forever, and this plan\nappeared so like decidedly settling down to a residence for life, that\nit made me low-spirited. I know that it is foolish, and that we have no\nchance of ever removing--but still I can not, even with this almost\ncertainty before my eyes, keep my mind from thinking upon one day\nreturning to my profession, and the idea of becoming a miller for life\nis what I can not as yet contemplate with any degree of composure.\"\n\n\"Well, Alfred, I only did it to tease you a little--not to hurt your\nfeelings, believe me,\" replied Emma. \"You shall not be a miller if you\ndon't like it. Henry will do better, perhaps, than you; but as for our\nquitting this place, I have no idea of it's being ever possible. I have\nmade up my mind to live and die in the Canadian woods, considering it my\nwayward fate that all 'my sweetness should be wasted on the desert\nair.'\"\n\n\"Repining is useless, if not sinful,\" observed Mary Percival. \"We have\nmuch to be thankful for; at least we are independent, and if we are ever\nto repay the kindness of our uncle and aunt, who must feel their change\nof condition so much more than we do, it must be by cheerfulness and\ncontent. I have been thinking as well as you, Alfred, and I'll tell you\nwhat was in my thoughts. I looked forward to a few years, by which time,\nas the country fills up so fast, it is very probable that we shall have\nother settlers here as neighbors, in every direction. This will give us\nsecurity. I also fancied that my uncle's farm and property became of\nvalue and importance, and that he himself became a leading man in the\ndistrict; not only at his ease, but, for a settler, even wealthy; and\nthen I fancied that, surrounded by others, in perfect security, and in\neasy and independent circumstances, my uncle would not forget the\nsacrifice which my cousin Alfred so nobly made, and would insist upon\nhis returning to that profession to which he is so much attached, and in\nwhich I have no doubt but that he will distinguish himself.\"\n\n\"Well said, my sweet prophet,\" said Alfred, kissing his cousin, \"you\nhave more sense than both of us.\"\n\n\"Answer for yourself, Alfred, if you please,\" said Emma, tossing her\nhead as if affronted. \"I shall not forget that remark of yours, I can\nassure you. Now, I prophesy quite the contrary; Alfred will never go to\nsea again. He will be taken with the charms of some Scotch settler's\ndaughter, some Janet or Moggy, and settle down into a Canadian farmer,\nmounted on a long-legged black pony.\"\n\n\"And I too,\" replied Alfred, \"prophesy, that at the same time that I\nmarry and settle as you have described Miss Emma Percival will yield up\nher charms to some long-legged, black, nondescript sort of a fellow, who\nwill set up a whisky-shop and instal his wife as bar-maid to attend upon\nand conciliate his customers.\"\n\n\"Emma, I think you have the worst of this peeping into futurity,\" said\nMary, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, if Alfred were not a false prophet, of which there are always many\ngoing about,\" replied Emma; \"however, I hope your prophecy may be the\ntrue one, Mary, and then we shall get rid of him.\"\n\n\"I flatter myself that you would be very sorry if I went away; you would\nhave no one to tease, at all events,\" replied Alfred, \"and that would be\na sad loss to yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, there's some sense in that remark,\" said Emma; \"but the cows are\nwaiting to be milked, and so, Mr. Alfred, if you are on your good\nbehavior, you had better go and bring us the pails.\"\n\n\"I really pity Alfred,\" said Mary, as soon as he was out of hearing;\n\"his sacrifice has been very great, and, much as he must feel it, how\nwell he bears up against it.\"\n\n\"He is a dear, noble fellow,\" replied Emma; \"and I do love him very\nmuch, although I can not help teasing him.\"\n\n\"But on some points you should be cautious, my dear sister; you don't\nknow what pain you give.\"\n\n\"Yes I do, and am always sorry when I have done it, but it is not until\nafterward that I recollect it, and then I am very angry with myself.\nDon't scold me, dear Mary, I will try to be wiser; I wonder whether what\nyou say will come to pass, and we shall have neighbors; I wish we had,\nif it were only on account of those Indians.\"\n\n\"I think it very probable,\" replied Mary; \"but time will show.\"\n\nAlfred then returned with the pails, and the conversation took another\nturn.\n\nA few days afterward, a corporal arrived from the fort, bringing letters\nand newspapers; the first that they had received since the breaking up\nof the winter. The whole family were in commotion as the intelligence\nwas proclaimed; Mary and Emma left the fowls which they were feeding;\nPercival threw down the pail with which he was attending the pigs;\nAlfred ran in from where he and Martin were busy splitting rails; all\ncrowded round Mr. Campbell as he opened the packet in which all the\nletters and papers had been enveloped at the foot. The letters were few;\nthree from Miss Paterson, and two other friends in England, giving them\nthe English news; one to Alfred from Captain Lumley, inquiring after the\nfamily, and telling him that he had mentioned his position to his\nfriends at the Board, and that there could be no call for his services\nfor the present; one from Mr. Campbell's English agent, informing him\nthat he had remitted the money paid by Mr. Douglas Campbell for the\nplants, etc., to his agent at Quebec; and another from his Quebec agent,\nadvising the receipt of the money and inclosing a balance-sheet. The\nletters were first read over, and then the newspapers were distributed,\nand all of them were soon very busy and silent during the perusal.\n\nAfter a while, Emma read out. \"Dear uncle, only hear this, how sorry I\nam.\"\n\n\"What is it, my dear?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"'Mrs. Douglas Campbell, of Wexton Hall, of a son, which survived but a\nfew hours after birth.'\"\n\n\"I am very sorry too, my dear Emma,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"Mr. Douglas\nCampbell's kindness to us must make us feel for any misfortune which may\nhappen to him, and to rejoice in any blessing which may be bestowed upon\nhim.\"\n\n\"It must have been a serious disappointment,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"but\none which, if it pleases God, may be replaced; and we may hope that\ntheir expectations, though blighted for the present, may be realized on\nsome future occasion.\"\n\n\"Here is a letter from Colonel Forster, which I overlooked,\" said Mr.\nCampbell; \"it was between the envelope. He says that he has received an\nanswer from the Governor, who fully agrees with him in his views on the\nsubject we were conversing about, and has allowed him to take any steps\nwhich he may think advisable. The Colonel says that he will call upon me\nagain in a few days, and that if in the meantime, I will let him know\nhow many soldiers I wish to employ, he will make arrangements to meet my\nviews as far as lies in his power. We have to thank Heaven for sending\nus friends, at all events,\" continued Mr. Campbell; \"but at present, we\nwill put his letter aside, and return to our English news.\"\n\n\"Dear England!\" exclaimed Emma.\n\n\"Yes, dear England, my good girl; we are English, and can love our\ncountry as much now as we did when we lived in it. We are still English,\nand in an English colony; it has pleased Heaven to remove us away from\nour native land, but our hearts and feelings are still the same, and so\nwill all English hearts be found to be in every settlement made by our\ncountry all over the wide world. We all glory in being English, and have\nreason to be proud of our country. May the feeling never be lost, but\nhave an elevating influence upon our general conduct!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\nIt was very nearly five weeks before Henry returned from his expedition\nto Montreal. During this time, the Colonel had repeated his visit and\nmade arrangements with Mr. Campbell. A party of twenty soldiers had been\nsent to work at felling timber and splitting rails, for whose services\nMr. Campbell paid as before. The winter house and palisade fence for the\nsheep were put in hand, and great progress was made in a short time, now\nthat so many people were employed. They had also examined the stream for\nsome distance, to ascertain which would be the most eligible site for\nthe water-mill, and had selected one nearly half a mile from the shore\nof the lake, and where there was a considerable fall, and the stream ran\nwith great rapidity. It was not, however, expected that the mill would\nbe erected until the following year, as it was necessary to have a\nmillwright and all the machinery from either Montreal or Quebec. It was\nintended that the estimate of the expense should be given in, the\ncontract made, and the order given during the autumn, so that it might\nbe all ready for the spring of the next year. It was on a Monday morning\nthat Henry arrived from the fort, where he had staid the Sunday, having\nreached it late on Saturday night. The _bateaux_, with the stock and\nstores, he had left at the fort; they were to come round during the day,\nbut Henry's impatience to see the family would not allow him to wait. He\nwas, as may be supposed, joyfully received, and, as soon as the first\nrecognitions were over, he proceeded to acquaint his father with what he\nhad done. He had obtained from a Canadian farmer forty ewes of very fair\nstock, although not any thing equal to the English; but the agent had\nworked hard for him, and procured him twenty English sheep and two rams\nof the best kind, to improve the breed. For the latter he had to pay\nrather dear, but they were worth any money to Mr. Campbell, who was\nquite delighted with the acquisition. In selecting the sheep, of course\nHenry was obliged to depend on the agent and the parties he employed,\nas he was no judge himself; but he had, upon his own judgment, purchased\ntwo Canadian horses, for Henry had been long enough at Oxford to know\nthe points of a horse, and as they turned out, he had made a very good\nbargain. He had also bought a sow and pigs of an improved breed, and all\nthe other commissions had been properly executed; the packages of skins\nalso realized the price which had been put on them. As it may be\nsupposed, he was full of news, talking about Montreal, the parties he\nhad been invited to and the people with whom he had become acquainted.\nHe had not forgotten to purchase some of the latest English publications\nfor his cousins, besides a few articles of millinery, which he thought\nnot too gay for their present position. He was still talking, and\nprobably would have gone on talking for hours longer, so many were the\nquestions which he had to reply to, when Martin came in and announced\nthe arrival of the _bateaux_ with the stores and cattle, upon which they\nall went down to the beach to see them disembarked and brought up by the\nsoldiers, who were at work. The stores were carried up to the door of\nthe storehouse, and the sheep and horses were turned into the prairie\nwith the cows. A week's rations for the soldiers were also brought up\nfrom the fort, and the men were very busy in the distribution, and\ncarrying them to the little temporary huts of boughs which they had\nraised for their accommodation, during the time they worked for Mr.\nCampbell. Before the evening set in every thing was arranged, and Henry\nwas again surrounded by the family and replying to their remaining\ninterrogatories. He told them that the Governor of Montreal had sent\nthem an invitation to pass the winter at Government-House, and promised\nthe young ladies that no wolf should venture to come near to them, and\nthat the aids-de-camp had requested the honor of their hands at the\nfirst ball, which should be given after their arrival, at which they all\nlaughed heartily. In short, it appeared that nothing could equal the\nkindness and hospitality which had been shown to him, and that there was\nno doubt, if they chose to go there, that it would be equally extended\nto the other members of the family.\n\nThere was a pause in the conversation, when Malachi addressed Mr.\nCampbell.\n\n\"Martin wishes me to speak to you, sir,\" said Malachi.\n\n\"Martin,\" said Mr. Campbell, looking round for him, and perceiving that\nhe was not in the room; \"why, yes, I perceive he is gone out. What can\nit be that he can not say for himself?\"\n\n\"That's just what I said to him,\" replied Malachi; \"but he thought it\nwere better to come through me; the fact is, sir, that he has taken a\nliking to the Strawberry, and wishes to make her his wife.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I don't think that he would have said any thing about it as\nyet, but you see, there are so many soldiers here, and two or three of\nthem are of Martin's mind, and that makes him feel uncomfortable till\nthe thing is settled; and as he can't well marry while in your service\nwithout your leave, he has asked me to speak about it.\"\n\n\"Well, but the Strawberry is your property, not mine. Malachi.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, according to Indian fashion, I am her father; but I've no\nobjection, and shan't demand any presents for her.\"\n\n\"Presents for her! why we in general give presents or money with a\nwife,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Yes, I know you do, but English wives ain't Indian wives; an English\nwife requires people to work for her and costs money to keep, but an\nIndian wife works for herself and her husband, so she is of value and is\ngenerally bought of the father; I reckon in the end that it's cheaper to\npay for an Indian wife than to receive money with an English one; but\nthat's as may be.\"\n\n\"That's not a very polite speech of yours, Malachi,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Perhaps it ain't, ma'am, but it's near the mark, nevertheless. Now I am\nwilling that Martin should have the Strawberry, because I know that he\nis a smart hunter, and will keep her well; and somehow or another, I\nfeel that if he made her his wife, I should be more comfortable; I shall\nlive with them here close by, and Martin will serve you, and when he\nhas a wife he will not feel inclined to change service and go into the\nwoods.\"\n\n\"I think it is an excellent proposal, Malachi, and am much pleased with\nit, as we now shall have you all together,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, so you will, and then I'll be always with the boy to look\nafter him, and you'll always know where we are, and not be frightened.\"\n\n\"Very true, Malachi,\" said Mr. Campbell; \"I consider it a very good\narrangement. We must build you a better lodge than the one that you are\nin.\"\n\n\"No, sir, not a better one, for if you have all you want, you can't want\nmore; it's big enough, but perhaps not quite near enough. I'm thinking\nthat when the sheep-fold is finished, it might be as well to raise our\nlodge inside of the palisades, and then we shall be a sort of guard to\nthe creatures.\"\n\n\"A very excellent idea, Malachi; well then, as far as I am concerned,\nMartin has my full consent to marry as soon as he pleases.\"\n\n\"And mine, if it is at all necessary,\" observed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"But who is to marry them?\" said Emma; \"they have no chaplain at the\nfort; he went away last year.\"\n\n\"Why, miss, they don't want no chaplain; she is an Indian girl, and he\nwill marry her Indian-fashion.\"\n\n\"But what fashion is that, Malachi?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Why, miss, he'll come to the lodge, and fetch her away to his own\nhouse.\"\n\nAlfred burst out into laughter. \"That's making short work of it,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"Yes, rather too short for my approval,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"Malachi,\nit's very true that the Strawberry is an Indian girl, but we are not\nIndians, and Martin is not an Indian, neither are you who stand as her\nfather; indeed, I can not consent to give my sanction to such a\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, as you please, but it appears to me to be all right. If\nyou go into a country and wish to marry a girl of that country, you\nmarry her according to the rules of that country. Now, Martin seeks an\nIndian squaw, and why not therefore marry her after Indian fashion?\"\n\n\"You may be right, Malachi, in your argument,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"but\nstill you must make allowances for our prejudices. We never should think\nthat she was a married woman, if no further ceremony was to take place\nthan what you propose.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, just as you please; but still, suppose you marry them\nafter your fashion, the girl won't understand a word that is said, so\nwhat good will it do?\"\n\n\"None to her at present, Malachi; but recollect, if she is not a\nChristian at present, she may be hereafter; I have often thought upon\nthat subject, and although I feel it useless to speak to her just now,\nyet as soon as she understands English well enough to know what I say to\nher, I hope to persuade her to become one. Now, if she should become a\nChristian, as I hope in God she will, she then will perceive that she\nhas not been properly married, and will be anxious to have the ceremony\nproperly performed over again; so why not do it now?\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, if it pleases you, I have no objection; I'm sure Martin\nwill have none.\"\n\n\"It will please me very much, Malachi,\" replied Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"And although there is no chaplain at the fort,\" observed Mr. Campbell,\n\"yet the Colonel can marry in his absence; a marriage by a commanding\nofficer is quite legal.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Alfred, \"and so is one by a Captain of a man-of-war.\"\n\n\"So be it then,\" replied Malachi, \"the sooner the better, for the\nsoldiers are very troublesome, and I can not keep them out of my lodge.\"\n\nMartin, who had remained outside the door and overheard all that passed,\nnow came in; the subject was again canvassed, and Martin returned his\nthanks for the permission given to him.\n\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"I little thought we should have a wedding in the\nfamily so soon; this is quite an event. Martin, I wish you joy--you will\nhave a very pretty and a very good wife.\"\n\n\"I think so too, miss,\" replied Martin.\n\n\"Where is she?\" said Mary.\n\n\"She is in the garden, miss,\" said Malachi, \"getting out of the way of\nthe soldiers; now that the work is done, they torment her not a little,\nand she is glad to escape from them; I'd tell them to go away, but they\ndon't mind me; they know I must not use my rifle.\"\n\n\"I should hope not,\" replied Mrs. Campbell, \"it would be hard to shoot a\ngood man merely because he wished to marry your daughter.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, ma'am, it would,\" replied Malachi, \"so the sooner she is\ngiven to Martin the sooner we shall have peace.\"\n\nAs the boat was continually going backward and forward between the fort\nand the farm, Mr. Campbell wrote to the Colonel, stating what they\nwished him to do, and the Colonel appointed that day week, on which he\nwould come and perform the ceremony. It was a little fête at the farm.\nMrs. Campbell and the Miss Percivals dressed themselves more than\nusually smart, so did all the males of the establishment; a better\ndinner than usual was prepared, as the Colonel and some of the officers\nwere to dine and spend the day with them. Martin was very gayly attired,\nand in high spirits. The Strawberry had on a new robe of young deer\nskin, and had a flower or two in her long black hair; she looked as she\nwas, very pretty and very modest, but not at all embarrassed. The\nmarriage ceremony was explained to her by Malachi, and she cheerfully\nconsented. Before noon the marriage took place, and an hour or two\nafterward they sat down to a well-furnished table, and the whole party\nwere very merry, particularly as the Colonel, who was most unusually\ngay, insisted upon the Strawberry sitting at the table, which she had\nnever done before. She acquitted herself, however, without\nembarrassment, and smiled when they laughed, although she could\nunderstand but little of what they said. Mr. Campbell opened two of his\nbottles of wine to celebrate the day, and they had a very happy party;\nthe only people who were discontented were three or four of the soldiers\noutside, who had wanted to marry the Strawberry themselves; but the\nknowledge that the Colonel was there, effectually put a stop to any\nthing like annoyance or disturbance on their part. At sunset, the\nColonel and officers departed for the fort, the family remained in the\nhouse till past ten o'clock, by which time all the soldiers had gone to\nbed. Mr. Campbell then read prayers, and offered up an additional one\nfor the happiness of the newly-married couple, after which they all\nsaluted the Strawberry and wished her good-night; she was then led to\nthe lodge by Martin, accompanied by Alfred, Henry, Malachi, Percival,\nand John, who all went home with them as a guard from any interruption\non the part of the disappointed suitors.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n\"How cheerful and gay every thing looks now,\" observed Emma to Mary, a\nfew mornings after the celebration of the marriage. \"One could hardly\ncredit that in a few months all this animated landscape will be nothing\nbut one dreary white mass of snow and ice, with no sounds meeting the\near but the howling of the storm and the howling of the wolves.\"\n\n\"Two very agreeable additions certainly,\" replied Mary, \"but what you\nobserve was actually occurring to my own mind at the very moment.\"\n\nThe scene was indeed cheerful and lively. The prairie on one side of the\nstream waved its high grass to the summer breeze; on the other, the\ncows, horses and sheep were grazing in every direction. The lake in the\ndistance was calm and unruffled; the birds were singing and chirping\nmerrily in the woods; near the house the bright green of the herbage was\nstudded with the soldiers, dressed in white, employed in various ways;\nthe corn waved its yellow ears between the dark stumps of the trees in\nthe cleared land, and the smoke from the chimney of the house mounted\nstraight up in a column to the sky; the grunting of the pigs and the\ncackling of the fowls, and the occasional bleating of the calves,\nresponded to by the lowing of the cows, gave life and animation to the\npicture. At a short distance from the shore the punt was floating on the\nstill waters. John and Malachi were very busy fishing; the dogs were\nlying down by the palisades, all except Oscar, who, as usual, attended\nupon his young mistresses; and under the shade of a large tree, at a\nlittle distance from the house, were Mr. Campbell and Percival, the\nformer reading while the other was conning over his lesson.\n\n\"This looks but little like a wilderness now, Mary, does it?\" said Emma.\n\n\"No, my dear sister. It is very different from what it was when we first\ncame; but still I should like to have some neighbors.\"\n\n\"So should I; any society is better than none at all.\"\n\n\"There I do not agree with you; at the same time, I think we could find\npleasure in having about us even those who are not cultivated, provided\nthey were respectable and good.\"\n\n\"That's what I would have said, Mary; but we must go in, and practice\nthe new air for the guitar which Henry brought us from Montreal. We\npromised him that we would. Here comes Alfred to spend his idleness upon\nus.\"\n\n\"His idleness, Emma; surely, you don't mean that; he's seldom if ever\nunemployed.\"\n\n\"Some people are very busy about nothing,\" replied Emma.\n\n\"Yes; and some people say what they do not mean, sister,\" replied Mary.\n\n\"Well, Alfred, here is Emma pronouncing you to be an idle body.\"\n\n\"I am not likely to be that, at all events,\" replied Alfred, taking off\nhis hat and fanning himself. \"My father proposes to give me enough to\ndo. What do you think he said to me this morning before breakfast?\"\n\n\"I suppose he said that you might as well go to sea again as remain\nhere,\" replied Emma, laughing.\n\n\"No, indeed; I wish he had; but he has proposed that your prophecy\nshould be fulfilled, my malicious little cousin. He has proposed my\nturning miller.\"\n\nEmma clapped her hands and laughed.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Why, he pointed out to me that the mill would cost about two hundred\nand fifty pounds, and that he thought as my half-pay was unemployed,\nthat it would be advisable that I should expend it in erecting the mill,\noffering me the sum necessary for the purpose. He would advance the\nmoney, and I might repay him as I received my pay. That, he said, would\nbe a provision for me, and eventually an independence.\"\n\n\"I told you that you would be a miller,\" replied Emma, laughing. \"Poor\nAlfred!\"\n\n\"Well, what did you reply, Alfred?\" said Mary.\n\n\"I said yes, I believe, because I did not like to say no.\"\n\n\"You did perfectly right, Alfred,\" replied Mary. \"There can be no harm\nin your having the property, and had you refused it, it would have given\npain to your father. If your money is laid out on the mill, my uncle\nwill have more to expend upon the farm; but still it does not follow\nthat you are to become a miller all your life.\"\n\n\"I should hope not,\" replied Alfred; \"as soon as Emma meets with that\nlong black gentleman we were talking of, I'll make it over to her as a\nmarriage portion.\"\n\n\"Thank you, cousin,\" replied Emma, \"I may put you in mind of your\npromise; but now Mary and I must go in and astonish the soldiers with\nour music; so good-by, Mr. Campbell, the miller.\"\n\nThe soldiers had now been at work for more than two months, a large\nportion of the wood had been felled and cleared away. With what had been\ncleared by Alfred and Martin and Henry the year before, they had now\nmore than forty acres of corn land. The rails for the snake-fence had\nalso been split, and the fence was almost complete round the whole of\nthe prairie and cleared land, when it was time for the grass to be cut\ndown and the hay made and gathered up. This had scarcely been finished\nwhen the corn was ready for the sickle and gathered; in a barn had been\nraised close to the sheep-fold as well as the lodge for Malachi, Martin,\nand his wife. For six weeks all was bustle and hard work, but the\nweather was fine, and every thing was got in safe. The services of the\nsoldiers were now no longer required, and Mr. Campbell having settled\nhis accounts, they returned to the fort.\n\n\"Who would think,\" said Henry to Alfred, as he cast his eyes over the\nbuildings, the stacks of corn and hay, and the prairie stocked with\ncattle, \"that we had only been here so short a time?\"\n\n\"Many hands make light work,\" replied Alfred; \"we have done with the\nhelp from the fort what it would have taken us six years to do with our\nown resources. My father's money has been well laid out, and will bring\nin good return.\"\n\n\"You have heard of the proposal of Colonel Forster, about the cattle at\nthe fort?\"\n\n\"No; what is it?\"\n\n\"He wrote to my father yesterday, saying, as he had only the means of\nfeeding the cows necessary for the officers of the garrison, that he\nwould sell all the oxen at present at the fort at a very moderate\nprice.\"\n\n\"But even if we have fodder enough for them during the winter what are\nwe to do with them?\"\n\n\"Sell them again to the fort for the supply of the troops,\" replied\nHenry, \"and thereby gain good profit. The commandant says that it will\nbe cheaper to government in the end than being compelled to feed them.\"\n\n\"That it will, I have no doubt, now that they have nothing to give them;\nthey trusted chiefly to our prairie for hay; and if they had not had\nsuch a quantity in store, they could not have fed them last winter.\"\n\n\"My father will consent, I know; indeed he would be very foolish not to\ndo so, for most of them will be killed when the winter sets in, and will\nonly cost us the grazing.\"\n\n\"We are fortunate in finding such friends as we have done,\" replied\nAlfred. \"All this assistance would not have been given to perhaps any\nother settlers.\"\n\n\"No, certainly not; but you see, Alfred, we are indebted to your\ninfluence with Captain Lumley for all these advantages, at least my\nfather and mother say so, and I agree with them. Captain Lumley's\ninfluence with the Governor has created all this interest about us.\"\n\n\"I think we must allow that the peculiar position of the family has done\nmuch toward it. It is not often that they meet with settlers of refined\nhabits and cultivated minds, and there naturally must be a feeling\ntoward a family of such a description in all generous minds.\"\n\n\"Very true, Alfred,\" replied Henry; \"but there is our mother waiting for\nus to go in to dinner.\"\n\n\"Yes; and the Strawberry by her side. What a nice little creature she\nis!\"\n\n\"Yes; and how quickly she is becoming useful. She has almost given up\nher Indian customs and is settling down quietly into English habits.\nMartin appears very fond of her.\"\n\n\"And so he ought to be,\" replied Henry; \"a wife with a smile always upon\nher lips is a treasure. Come, let us go in.\"\n\nAnother fortnight passed away when an incident occurred which created\nsome uneasiness. Mr. Campbell was busy with Martin and Alfred clearing\nout the store-room and arranging the stores. Many of the cases and\npackages had been opened to be examined and aired, and they were busily\nemployed, when, turning round, Mr. Campbell, to his great surprise,\nbeheld an Indian by his side, who was earnestly contemplating the\nvarious packages of blankets, etc., and cases of powder, shot, and other\narticles, which were opened around him.\n\n\"Why, who is this?\" exclaimed Mr. Campbell, starting.\n\nMartin and Alfred, who had their backs to him at the time of Mr.\nCampbell's exclamation, turned round and beheld the Indian. He was an\nelderly man, very tall and muscular, dressed in leggins and deer-skin\ncoat, a war eagle's feather, fixed by a fillet, on his head, and a\nprofusion of copper and brass medals and trinkets round his neck. His\nface was not painted, with the exception of two black circles round his\neyes. His head was shaved, and one long scalp-lock hung behind him. He\nhad a tomahawk and a knife in his belt and a rifle upon his arm. Martin\nadvanced to the Indian and looked earnestly at him.\n\n\"I know his tribe,\" said Martin; \"but not his name; but he is a chief\nand a warrior.\"\n\nMartin then spoke to him in the Indian tongue. The Indian merely gave an\n\"ugh\" in reply.\n\n\"He does not choose to give his name,\" observed Martin; \"and, therefore,\nhe is here for no good. Mr. Alfred, just fetch Malachi; he will know him\nI dare say.\"\n\nAlfred went to the house for Malachi; in the meantime the Indian\nremained motionless, with his eyes fixed upon different articles exposed\nto view.\n\n\"It's strange,\" observed Martin, \"how he could have come here; but to be\nsure neither Malachi nor I have been out lately.\"\n\nJust as he had finished his remark, Alfred returned with Malachi.\nMalachi looked at the Indian and spoke to him.\n\nThe Indian now replied in the Indian language.\n\n\"I knew him, sir,\" said Malachi, \"the moment I saw his back. He's after\nno good, and it's a thousand pities that he has come just now and seen\nall this,\" continued Malachi; \"it's a strong temptation.\"\n\n\"Why, who is he?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"The Angry Snake, sir,\" replied Malachi. \"I had no idea that he would be\nin these parts before the meeting of the Indian council, which takes\nplace in another month, and then I meant to have been on the look-out\nfor him.\"\n\n\"But what have we to fear from him?\"\n\n\"Well; that's to be proved; but this I can say, that he has his eyes\nupon what appears to him of more value than all the gold in the\nuniverse; and he's any thing but honest.\"\n\n\"But we have nothing to fear from one man,\" observed Alfred.\n\n\"His party ain't far off, sir,\" said Malachi. \"He has some followers,\nalthough not many, and those who follow him are as bad as himself. We\nmust be on the watch.\"\n\nMalachi now addressed the Indian for some time; the only reply was an\n\"ugh.\"\n\n\"I have told him that all the powder and ball that he sees are for our\nrifles, which are more than are possessed by his whole tribe. Not that\nit does much good, but at all events it's just as well to let him know\nthat we shall be well prepared. The crittur's quite amazed at so much\nammunition; that's a fact. It's a pity he ever saw it.\"\n\n\"Shall we give him some?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"No, no, sir; he would only make use of it to try to get the rest;\nhowever, I believe that he is the only one of his party who has a rifle.\nThe best thing is to close the doors and then he will go.\"\n\nThey did as Malachi requested, and the Indian, after waiting a short\ntime, turned round on his heel, and walked away.\n\n\"He is a regular devil, that Angry Snake,\" observed Malachi, as he\nwatched him departing; \"but never mind, I'll be a match for him. I wish\nhe'd never seen all that ammunition, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"At all events, we had better not say a word in the house about his\nmaking his appearance,\" said Mr. Campbell. \"It will only alarm the\nwomen, and do no good.\"\n\n\"That's true, sir. I'll only tell the Strawberry,\" said Martin; \"she's\nan Indian, and it will put her on the look-out.\"\n\n\"That will be as well, but caution her not to mention it to Mrs.\nCampbell or the girls, Martin.\"\n\n\"Never fear, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"I'll watch his motions\nnevertheless; to-morrow I'll be in the woods and on his trail. I'm glad\nthat he saw me here, for he fears me; I know that.\"\n\nIt so happened that the Indian was not seen by Mrs. Campbell or any of\nthem in the house, either upon his arrival or departure; and when Mr.\nCampbell and the others returned to the house, they found that no one\nthere had any idea of such a visit having been paid. The secret was\nkept, but it occasioned a great deal of anxiety for some days. At last\nthe alarm of Mr. Campbell gradually subsided. Malachi had gone out with\nJohn, and had discovered that all the Indians had come down near to\nthem, to meet in council, and that there were many other parties of them\nin the woods. But although the visit of the Angry Snake might have been\npartly accidental, still Malachi was convinced that there was every\nprospect of his paying them another visit, if he could obtain a\nsufficient number to join him, so that he might obtain by force the\narticles he had seen and so much coveted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\nMr. Campbell acceded to the offer made by the commandant of the fort,\nand purchased of him, at a moderate price, eighteen oxen, which were all\nthat remained of the stock at the fort, except the cows. He also took\nsix weaning calves to bring up. The cattle were now turned into the bush\nto feed, that they might obtain some after-grass from that portion of\nthe prairie on which they had been feeding. The summer passed quickly\naway, for they all had plenty of employment. They fished every day in\nthe lake, and salted what they did not eat, for winter provision. Martin\nnow was a great part of his time in the woods, looking after the cattle,\nand Malachi occasionally accompanied him, but was oftener out hunting\nwith John, and always returned with game. They brought in a good many\nbear-skins, and sometimes the flesh, which, although approved of by\nMalachi and Martin, was not much admired by the rest. As soon as the\nafter-grass had been gathered in, there was not so much to do. Henry and\nMr. Campbell, with Percival, were quite sufficient to look after the\nstock, and as the leaves began to change, the cattle were driven in from\nthe woods, and pastured on the prairie. Every thing went on in order;\none day was the counterpart of another. Alfred and Henry threshed out\nthe corn, in the shed, or rather open barn, which had been put up by the\nsoldiers in the sheep-fold, and piled up the straw for winter-fodder for\nthe cattle. The oats and wheat were taken into the store-house. Martin's\nwife could now understand English, and spoke it a little. She was very\nuseful, assisting Mrs. Campbell and her nieces in the house, and\nattending the stock. They had brought up a large number of chickens, and\nhad disposed of a great many to the Colonel and officers of the fort.\nTheir pigs also had multiplied exceedingly, and many had been put up to\nfatten, ready to be killed and salted down. The time for that\noccupation was now come, and they were very busy curing their meat; they\nhad also put up a small shed for smoking their bacon and hams. Already\nthey were surrounded with comfort and plenty, and felt grateful to\nHeaven that they had been so favored.\n\nThe autumn had now advanced, and their routine of daily duty was seldom\ninterrupted; now and then a visit was paid them from the fort by one or\nother of the officers or the commandant. The Indians had held their\ncouncil, but the English agent was present, and the supply of blankets\nand other articles sent to the chiefs for distribution had the effect of\nremoving all animosity. It is true that the Angry Snake and one or two\nmore made very violent speeches, but they were overruled. The calumet of\npeace had been presented and smoked, and all danger appeared to be over\nfrom that quarter. Malachi had gone to the council, and was well\nreceived. He had been permitted to speak also as an English agent, and\nhis words were not without effect. Thus every thing wore the appearance\nof peace and prosperity, when an event occurred which we shall now\nrelate.\n\nWhat is termed the Indian summer had commenced, during which there is a\nkind of haze in the atmosphere. One morning, a little before dawn, Mary\nand Emma, who happened to be up first, went out to milk the cows, when\nthey observed that the haze was much thicker than usual. They had been\nexpecting the equinoctial gales, which were very late this year, and\nMary observed that she foresaw they were coming on, as the sky wore\nevery appearance of wind; yet still there was but a light air, and\nhardly perceptible at the time. In a moment after they had gone out, and\nwere taking up their pails, Strawberry came to them from her own lodge,\nand they pointed to the gloom and haze in the air. She turned round, as\nif to catch the wind, and snuffed for a little while; at last she said,\n\"Great fire in the woods.\" Alfred and the others soon joined them, and\nhaving been rallied by Emma at their being so late, they also observed\nthe unusual appearance of the sky. Martin corroborated the assertion of\nthe Strawberry, that there was fire in the woods. Malachi and John had\nnot returned that night from a hunting expedition, but shortly after\ndaylight they made their appearance; they had seen the fire in the\ndistance, and said that it was to northward and eastward, and extended\nmany miles; that they had been induced to leave the chase and come home\nin consequence. During the remainder of the day, there was little or no\nwind, but the gloom and smell of fire increased rapidly. At night the\nbreeze sprang up and soon increased to a gale from the north-east, the\ndirection in which the fire had been seen. Malachi and Martin were up\nseveral times in the night, for they knew that if the wind continued in\nthat quarter, without any rain, there would be danger; still the fire\nwas at a great distance, but in the morning the wind blew almost a\nhurricane, and before twelve o'clock on the next day, the smoke was\nborne down upon them, and carried away in masses over the lake.\n\n\"Do you think there is any danger, Martin, from this fire?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Why, sir, that depends upon circumstances; if the wind were to blow\nfrom the quarter which it now does, as hard as it does, for another\ntwenty-four hours, we should have the fire right down upon us.\"\n\n\"But still we have so much clear land between the forest and us, that I\nshould think the house would be safe.\"\n\n\"I don't know that, sir. You have never seen the woods afire for miles\nas I have; if you had, you would know what it was. We have two chances:\none is, that we may have torrents of rain come down with the gale, and\nthe other is, that the wind may shift a point or two, which would be the\nbest chance for us of the two.\"\n\nBut the wind did not shift, and the rain did not descend, and before the\nevening set in, the fire was within two miles of them, and distant\nroaring rent the air; the heat and smoke became more oppressive, and the\nparty were under great alarm.\n\nAs the sun set, the wind became even more violent, and now the flames\nwere distinctly to be seen, and the whole air was filled with myriads of\nsparks. The fire bore down upon them with resistless fury, and soon the\natmosphere was so oppressive, that they could scarcely breathe; the\ncattle galloped down to the lake, their tails in the air, and lowing\nwith fear. There they remained, knee-deep in the water, and huddled\ntogether.\n\n\"Well, Malachi,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"this is very awful. What shall we\ndo?\"\n\n\"Trust in God, sir; we can do nothing else,\" replied Malachi.\n\nThe flames were now but a short distance from the edge of the forest;\nthey threw themselves up into the air in high columns; then, borne down\nby the wind, burst through the boughs of the forest, scorching here and\nthere on the way the trunks of the large trees; while such a torrent of\nsparks and ignited cinders was poured down upon the prairie, that, added\nto the suffocating masses of smoke, it was impossible to remain there\nany longer.\n\n\"You must all go down to the punt, and get on board,\" said Malachi.\n\"There's not a moment for delay; you will be smothered if you remain\nhere. Mr. Alfred, do you and Martin pull out as far into the lake as is\nnecessary for you to be clear of the smoke and able to breathe. Quick,\nthere is no time to be lost, for the gale is rising faster than before.\"\n\nThere was, indeed, no time to be lost. Mr. Campbell took his wife by the\narm; Henry led the girls, for the smoke was so thick that they could not\nsee the way. Percival and Strawberry followed. Alfred and Martin had\nalready gone down to get the boat ready. In a few minutes they were in\nthe boat, and pushed off from the shore. The boat was crowded, but,\nbeing flat-bottom, she bore the load well. They pulled out about half a\nmile into the lake, before they found themselves in a less oppressive\natmosphere. Not a word was spoken until Martin and Alfred had stopped\nrowing.\n\n\"And old Malachi and John, where are they?\" said Mrs. Campbell, who, now\nthat they were clear of the smoke, discovered that these were not in the\nboat.\n\n\"Oh, never fear them, ma'am,\" replied Martin, \"Malachi staid behind to\nsee if he could be of use. He knows how to take care of himself, and of\nJohn too.\"\n\n\"This is an awful visitation,\" said Mrs. Campbell, after a pause. \"Look,\nthe whole wood is now on fire, close down to the clearing. The house\nmust be burned, and we shall save nothing.\"\n\n\"It is the will of God, my dear wife; and if we are to be deprived of\nwhat little wealth we have, we must not murmur, but submit with\nresignation. Let us thank Heaven that our lives are preserved.\"\n\nAnother pause ensued; at last the silence was broken by Emma.\n\n\"There is the cow-house on fire--I see the flames bursting from the\nroof.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell, whose hand was on that of her husband, squeezed it in\nsilence. It was the commencement of the destruction of their whole\nproperty--all their labors and efforts had been thrown away. The winter\nwas coming on, and they would be houseless--what would become of them!\n\nAll this passed in her mind, but she did not speak.\n\nAt this moment the flames of the fire rose up straight to the sky.\nMartin perceived it, and jumped up on his feet.\n\n\"There is a lull in the wind,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Martin, and continued holding up his hand, \"I felt a drop\nof rain. Yes, it's coming; another quarter of an hour and we may be\nsafe.\"\n\nMartin was correct in his observation; the wind had lulled for a moment,\nand he had felt the drops of rain. This pause continued for about three\nor four minutes, during which the cow-house burned furiously, but the\nashes and sparks were no longer hurled down on the prairie; then\nsuddenly the wind shifted to the south-east, with such torrents of rain\nas almost to blind them. So violent was the gust, that even the punt\ncareened to it; but Alfred pulled its head round smartly, and put it\nbefore the wind. The gale was now equally strong from the quarter to\nwhich it had changed; the lake became agitated and covered with white\nfoam, and before the punt reached the shore again, which it did in a few\nminutes, the water washed over its two sides, and they were in danger of\nswamping. Alfred directed them all to sit still, and raising the blades\nof the oars up into the air, the punt was dashed furiously through the\nwaves, till it grounded on the beach.\n\nMartin and Alfred jumped out into the water and hauled the punt further\nbefore they disembarked; the rain still poured down in torrents, and\nthey were wet to the skin; as they landed, they were met by Malachi and\nJohn.\n\n\"It's all over, and all is safe!\" exclaimed Malachi, \"it was touch and\ngo, that's sartin; but all's safe, except the cow-house, and that's\neasily put to rights again. You all had better go home as fast as you\ncan, and get to bed.\"\n\n\"Is all quite safe, do you think, Malachi?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, sir, no fear now; the fire hasn't passed the stream, and even if\nit had, this rain would put it out, for we only have the beginning of\nit; but it was a near thing, that's sartin.\"\n\nThe party walked back to the house, and as soon as they had entered, Mr.\nCampbell kneeled down and thanked Heaven for their miraculous\npreservation. All joined heartily in the prayer, and, after they had\nwaited up a few minutes, by which time they were satisfied that the\nflames were fast extinguishing and they had nothing more to fear, they\ntook off their wet clothes, and retired to bed.\n\nThe next morning they rose early, for all were anxious to ascertain the\nmischief which had been occasioned by the fire. The cow-house, on the\nopposite side of the stream, was the only part of the premises which had\nseverely suffered; the walls were standing, but the roof was burned. On\nthe side of the stream where the house stood, the rails and many\nportions of the buildings were actually charred, and, had it not been\nfor the providential change of the wind and the falling of the rain,\nmust in a few minutes have been destroyed. The prairie was covered with\ncinders, and the grass was burned and withered. The forest on the other\nside of the stream, to a great extent, was burned down; some of the\nlargest trees still remained, throwing out their blackened arms, now\nleafless and branchless, to the sky, but they were never to throw forth\na branch or leaf again. It was a melancholy and desolate picture, and\nrendered still more so by the heavy rain which still continued to pour\ndown without intermission.\n\nAs they were surveying the scene, Malachi and Martin came to them.\n\n\"The stock are all right, sir,\" said Martin; \"I counted them, and there\nis not one missing. There's no harm done except to the cow-house; on the\ncontrary, the fire has proved a good friend to us.\"\n\n\"How so, Martin?\" asked Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Because it has cleared many acres, of ground, and saved us much labor.\nAll on the other side of the stream is now cleared away, and next spring\nwe will have corn between the stumps; and in autumn, after we have\ngathered in the harvest, we will cut down and burn the trees which are\nnow standing. It has done a deal of good to the prairie also, we shall\nhave fine herbage there next spring.\"\n\n\"We have to thank Heaven for its mercy,\" said Mr. Campbell; \"at one time\nyesterday evening, I thought we were about to be rendered destitute\nindeed, but it has pleased God that it should be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" observed Malachi; \"what threatened your ruin has turned out\nto your advantage. Next year you will see every thing green and fresh as\nbefore; and, as Martin says, you have to thank the fire for clearing\naway more land for you than a whole regiment of soldiers could have done\nin two or three years.\"\n\n\"But we must work hard and get in the corn next spring, for otherwise\nthe brushwood will grow up so fast, as to become a forest again in a few\nyears.\"\n\n\"I never thought of inquiring,\" said Mary, \"how it was that the forest\ncould have taken fire.\"\n\n\"Why, miss,\" replied Malachi, \"in the autumn, when every thing is as dry\nas tinder, nothing is more easy. The Indians light their fire, and do\nnot take the trouble to put it out, and that is generally the cause of\nit; but then it requires wind to help it.\"\n\nThe danger that they had escaped made a serious impression on the whole\nparty, and the following day, being Sunday, Mr. Campbell did not forget\nto offer up a prayer of thankfulness for their preservation.\n\nThe roof of the cow-house was soon repaired by Alfred and Martin, and\nthe Indian summer passed away without any further adventure.\n\nThe day after the fire, a dispatch arrived from the fort to ascertain\ntheir welfare, and the Colonel and officers were greatly rejoiced to\nlearn that comparatively so little damage had been done, for they\nexpected to find that the family had been burned out, and had made\narrangements at the fort to receive them.\n\nGradually the weather became cold and the fires were lighted, and a\nmonth after the evil we have described, the winter again set in.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nOnce more was the ground covered with snow to the depth of three feet.\nThe cattle were littered down inside the inclosure of palisades round\nthe cow-house; the sheep were driven into the inclosed sheep-fold, and\nthe horses were put into a portion of the barn in the sheep-fold which\nhad been parted off for them. All was made secure, and every preparation\nwas made for the long winter. Although there had been a fall of snow,\nthe severe frost had not yet come on. It did, however, in about a\nfortnight afterward, and then, according to the wishes of the Colonel,\nsix oxen were killed for the use of the fort, and taken there by the\nhorses on a sledge; this was the last task that they had to fulfill, and\nthen Alfred bade adieu to the officers of the fort, as they did not\nexpect to meet again till the winter was over. Having experienced one\nwinter, they were more fully prepared for the second; and as Malachi,\nthe Strawberry and John were now regular inmates of the house, for they\ndid not keep a separate table, there was a greater feeling of security,\nand the monotony and dreariness were not so great as in the preceding\nwinter: moreover, every thing was now in its place, and they had more\nto attend to,--two circumstances which greatly contributed to relieve\nthe _ennui_ arising from continual confinement. The hunting parties went\nout as usual; only Henry, and occasionally Alfred, remained at home to\nattend to the stock, and to perform other offices which the increase of\ntheir establishment required. The new books brought by Henry from\nMontreal, and which by common consent had been laid aside for the\nwinter's evenings, were now a great source of amusement, as Mr. Campbell\nread aloud a portion of them every evening. Time passed away quickly, as\nit always does when there is a regular routine of duties and employment,\nand Christmas came before they were aware of its approach.\n\nIt was a great comfort to Mrs. Campbell that she now always had John at\nhome, except when he was out hunting, and on that score she had long\ndismissed all anxiety, as she had full confidence in Malachi; but\nlatterly Malachi and John seldom went out alone; indeed, the old man\nappeared to like being in company, and his misanthropy had wholly\ndisappeared. He now invariably spent his evenings with the family\nassembled round the kitchen fire, and had become much more fond of\nhearing his own voice. John did not so much admire these evening\nparties. He cared nothing for new books, or indeed any books. He would\namuse himself making moccasins, or working porcupine quills with the\nStrawberry at one corner of the fire, and the others might talk or read,\nit was all the same, John never said a word or appeared to pay the least\nattention to what was said. His father occasionally tried to make him\nlearn something, but it was useless. He would remain for hours with his\nbook before him, but his mind was elsewhere. Mr. Campbell, therefore,\ngave up the attempt for the present, indulging the hope that when John\nwas older, he would be more aware of the advantages of education, and\nwould become more attentive. At present, it was only inflicting pain on\nthe boy without any advantage being gained. But John did not always sit\nby the kitchen fire. The wolves were much more numerous than in the\npreceding winter, having been attracted by the sheep which were within\nthe palisade, and every night the howling was incessant. The howl of a\nwolf was sufficient to make John seize his rifle and leave the house,\nand he would remain in the snow for hours till one came sufficiently\nnear for him to fire, and he had already killed several when a\ncircumstance occurred which was the cause of great uneasiness.\n\nJohn was out one evening as usual, crouched down within the palisades,\nand watching for the wolves. It was a bright starry night, but there was\nno moon, when he perceived one of the animals crawling along almost on\nits belly, close to the door of the palisade which surrounded the house.\nThis surprised him, as generally speaking, the animals prowled round the\npalisade which encircled the sheep-fold, or else close to the pig-sties\nwhich were at the opposite side from the entrance door. John leveled his\nrifle and fired, when to his astonishment, the wolf appeared to spring\nup in the air on his hind legs, then fall down and roll away. The key of\nthe palisade door was always kept within, and John determined to go in\nand fetch it, that he might ascertain whether he had killed the animal\nor not. When he entered, Malachi said, \"Did you kill, my boy?\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" replied John; \"come for the key to see.\"\n\n\"I don't like the gate being opened at night, John,\" said Mr. Campbell;\n\"why don't you leave it, as you usually do, till to-morrow morning; that\nwill be time enough?\"\n\n\"I don't know if it was a wolf,\" replied John.\n\n\"What, then, boy, tell me?\" said Malachi.\n\n\"Well, I think it was an Indian,\" replied John; who then explained what\nhad passed.\n\n\"Well, I shouldn't wonder,\" replied Malachi; \"at all events the gate\nmust not be opened to-night, for if it was an Indian you fired at, there\nis more than one of them; we'll keep all fast, John, and see what it was\nto-morrow.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell and the girls were much alarmed at this event, and it was\nwith difficulty that they were persuaded to retire to rest.\n\n\"We will keep watch to-night at all events,\" said Malachi, as soon as\nMrs. Campbell and her nieces had left the room. \"The boy is right, I\nhave no doubt. It is the Angry Snake and his party who are prowling\nabout, but if the boy has hit the Indian, which I have no doubt of, they\nwill make off; however, it will be just as well to be on our guard,\nnevertheless. Martin can watch here and I will watch in the fold.\"\n\nWe have before observed that the lodge of Malachi, Martin, and his wife,\nwas built within the palisade of the sheep-fold, and that there was a\npassage from the palisade round the house to that which surrounded the\nsheep-fold, which passage had also a palisade on each side of it.\n\n\"I will watch here,\" said Alfred; \"let Martin go home with you and his\nwife.\"\n\n\"I will watch with you,\" said John.\n\n\"Well, perhaps that will be better,\" said Malachi; \"two rifles are\nbetter than one, and if any assistance is required, there will be one to\nsend for it.\"\n\n\"But what do you think they would do, Malachi?\" said Mr. Campbell; \"they\ncan not climb the palisades.\"\n\n\"Not well, sir, nor do I think they would attempt it unless they had a\nlarge force, which I am sure they have not; no, sir, they would rather\nendeavor to set fire to the house if they could, but that's not so easy;\none thing is certain, that the Snake will try all he can to get\npossession of what he saw in your storehouse.\"\n\n\"That I do not doubt,\" said Alfred; \"but he will not find it so easy a\nmatter.\"\n\n\"They've been reconnoitering, sir, that's the truth of it, and if John\nhas helped one of them to a bit of lead, it will do good; for it will\nprove that we are on the alert, and make them careful how they come near\nthe house again.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes' more conversation, Mr. Campbell, Henry, and\nPercival retired, leaving the others to watch. Alfred walked home with\nMalachi and his party to see if all was right at the sheep-fold, and\nthen returned.\n\nThe night passed without any further disturbance except the howling of\nthe wolves, to which they were accustomed.\n\nThe next morning, at daybreak, Malachi and Martin came to the house,\nand, with John and Alfred, they opened the palisade gate, and went out\nto survey the spot where John had fired.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Malachi; \"it was an Indian, no doubt of it; here are\nthe dents made in the snow by his knees as he crawled along, and John\nhas hit him, for here is the blood. Let's follow the trail. See, sir, he\nhas been hard hit; there is more blood this way as we go on. Ha!\"\ncontinued Malachi, as he passed by a mound of snow, \"here's the\nwolf-skin he was covered up with; then he is dead or thereabouts, and\nthey have carried him off, for he never would have parted with his skin,\nif he had had his senses about him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" observed Martin, \"his wound was mortal, that's certain.\"\n\nThey pursued the track till they arrived at the forest, and then,\nsatisfied by the marks on the snow that the wounded man had been carried\naway, they returned to the house, when they found the rest of the family\ndressed and in the kitchen. Alfred showed them the skin of the wolf, and\ninformed them of what they had discovered.\n\n\"I am grieved that blood has been shed,\" observed Mrs. Campbell; \"I wish\nit had not happened. I have heard that the Indians never forgive on such\noccasions.\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, they are very revengeful, that's certain, but still they\nwon't like to risk too much. This has been a lesson to them. I only wish\nit had been the Angry Snake himself who was settled, as then we should\nhave no more trouble or anxiety about them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may be,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"No, sir, that's not likely; it's one of his young men; I know the\nIndian customs well.\"\n\nIt was some time before the alarm occasioned by this event subsided in\nthe mind of Mrs. Campbell and her nieces; Mr. Campbell also thought much\nabout it, and betrayed occasional anxiety. The parties went out hunting\nas before, but those at home now felt anxious till their return from the\nchase. Time, however, and not hearing any thing more of the Indians,\ngradually revived their courage, and before the winter was half over\nthey thought little about it. Indeed, it had been ascertained by Malachi\nfrom another band of Indians which he fell in with near a small lake\nwhere they were trapping beaver, that the Angry Snake was not in that\npart of the country, but had gone with his band to the westward at the\ncommencement of the new year. This satisfied them that the enemy had\nleft immediately after the attempt which he had made to reconnoiter the\npremises.\n\nThe hunting parties, therefore, as we said, continued as before; indeed,\nthey were necessary for the supply of so many mouths. Percival, who had\ngrown very much since his residence in Canada, was very anxious to be\npermitted to join them, which he never had been during the former\nwinter. This was very natural. He saw his younger brother go out almost\ndaily, and seldom return without having been successful; indeed, John\nwas, next to Malachi, the best shot of the party. It was, therefore,\nvery annoying to Percival that he should always be detained at home\ndoing all the drudgery of the house, such as feeding the pigs, cleaning\nknives, and other menial work, while his younger brother was doing the\nduty of a man. To Percival's repeated entreaties, objections were\nconstantly raised by his mother: they could not spare him, he was not\naccustomed to walk in snow-shoes. Mr Campbell observed that Percival\nbecame dissatisfied and unhappy, and Alfred took his part and pleaded\nfor him. Alfred observed very truly, that the Strawberry could\noccasionally do Percival's work, and that if it could be avoided, he\nshould not be cooped up at home in the way that he was; and, Mr.\nCampbell agreeing with Alfred, Mrs. Campbell very reluctantly gave her\nconsent to his occasionally going out.\n\n\"Why, aunt, have you such an objection to Percival going out with the\nhunters?\" said Mary. \"It must be very trying to him to be always\ndetained at home.\"\n\n\"I feel the truth of what you say, my dear Mary,\" said Mrs. Campbell,\n\"and I assure you it is not out of selfishness, or because we shall have\nmore work to do, that I wish him to remain with us; but I have an\ninstinctive dread that some accident will happen to him, which I can\nnot overcome, and there is no arguing with a mother's fears and a\nmother's love.\"\n\n\"You were quite as uneasy, my dear aunt, when John first went out; you\nwere continually in alarm about him, but now you are perfectly at ease,\"\nreplied Emma.\n\n\"Very true,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"it is, perhaps, a weakness on my part\nwhich I ought to get over; but we are all liable to such feelings. I\ntrust in God there is no real cause for apprehension, and that my\nreluctance is a mere weakness and folly. But I see the poor boy has long\npined at being kept at home; for nothing is more irksome to a\nhigh-couraged and spirited boy as he is. I have, therefore, given my\nconsent, because I think it is my duty; still the feeling remains, so\nlet us say no more about it, my dear girls, for the subject is painful\nto me.\"\n\n\"My dear aunt, did you not say that you would talk to Strawberry on the\nsubject of religion, and try if you could not persuade her to become a\nChristian? She is very serious at prayers, I observe; and appears, now\nthat she understands English, to be very attentive to what is said.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear Emma, it is my intention so to do very soon, but I do not\nlike to be in too great a hurry. A mere conforming to the usages of our\nreligion would be of little avail, and I fear that too many of our good\nmissionaries, in their anxiety to make converts, do not sufficiently\nconsider this point. Religion must proceed from conviction, and be\nseated in the heart; the heart, indeed, must be changed, not mere\noutward forms attended to.\"\n\n\"What is the religion of the Indians, my dear aunt?\" said Mary.\n\n\"One which makes conversion the more difficult. It is in many respects\nso near what is right, that Indians do not easily perceive the necessity\nof change. They believe in one God, the fountain of all good; they\nbelieve in a future state and in future rewards and punishments. You\nperceive they have the same foundation as we have, although they know\nnot Christ, and, having very incomplete notions of duty, have a very\ninsufficient sense of their manifold transgressions and offenses in\nGod's sight, and consequently have no idea of the necessity of a\nmediator. Now it is, perhaps, easier to convince those who are entirely\nwrong, such as worship idols and false gods, than those who approach so\nnearly to the truth. But I have had many hours of reflection upon the\nproper course to pursue, and I do intend to have some conversation with\nher on the subject in a very short time. I have delayed because I\nconsider it absolutely necessary that she should be perfectly aware of\nwhat I say, before I try to alter her belief. Now the Indian language,\nalthough quite sufficient for Indian wants, is poor, and has not the\nsame copiousness as ours, because they do not require the words to\nexplain what we term abstract ideas. It is, therefore, impossible to\nexplain the mysteries of our holy religion to one who does not well\nunderstand our language. I think, however, that the Strawberry now\nbegins to comprehend sufficiently for me to make the first attempt. I\nsay first attempt, because I have no idea of making a convert in a week,\nor a month, or even in six months. All I can do is to exert my best\nabilities, and then trust to God, who, in His own good time, will\nenlighten her mind to receive His truth.\"\n\nThe next day the hunting party went out, and Percival, to his great\ndelight, was permitted to accompany it. As they had a long way to go,\nfor they had selected the hunting ground, they set off early in the\nmorning, before daylight, Mr. Campbell having particularly requested\nthat they would not return home late.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\nThe party had proceeded many miles before they arrived at the spot where\nMalachi thought that they would fall in with some venison, which was the\nprincipal game that they sought. It was not till near ten o'clock in the\nmorning that they stood on the ground which had been selected for the\nsport. It was an open part of the forest, and the snow lay in large\ndrifts, but here and there on the hill-sides the grass was nearly bare,\nand the deer were able, by scraping with their feet, to obtain some\nfood. They were all pretty well close together when they arrived.\nPercival and Henry were about a quarter of a mile behind, for Percival\nwas not used to the snow-shoes, and did not get on so well as the\nothers. Malachi and the rest with him halted, that Henry and Percival\nmight come up with them, and then, after they had recovered their breath\na little, he said,\n\n\"Now, you see there's a fine lot of deer here, Master Percival, but as\nyou know nothing about woodcraft, and may put us all out, observe what I\nsay to you. The animals are not only cute of hearing and seeing, but\nthey are more cute of smell, and they can scent a man a mile off if the\nwind blows down to them; so you see it would be useless to attempt to\nget near to them if we do not get to the lee side of them without noise\nand without being seen. Now, the wind has been from the eastward, and as\nwe are to the southward, we must get round by the woods to the westward,\nbefore we go upon the open ground, and then, Master Percival, you must\ndo as we do, and keep behind, to watch our motions. If we come to a\nswell in the land, you must not run up, or even walk up, as you might\nshow yourself; the deer might be on the other side, within twenty yards\nof you; but you must hide yourself, as you will see that we shall do,\nand when we have found them, I will put you in a place where you shall\nhave your shot as well as we. Do you understand, Master Percival?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, and I shall stop behind, and do as you tell me.\"\n\n\"Well then, now, we will go back into the thick of the forest till we go\nto the leeward, and then we shall see whether you will make a hunter or\nnot.\"\n\nThe whole party did as Malachi directed, and for more than an hour they\nwalked through the wood, among the thickest of the trees, that they\nmight not be seen by the animals. At last they arrived at the spot which\nMalachi desired, and then they changed their course eastward toward the\nmore open ground, where they expected to find the deer.\n\nAs they entered upon the open ground, they moved forward crouched to the\nground, Malachi and Martin in the advance. When in the hollows, they\nall collected together, but on ascending a swell of the land, it was\neither Malachi or Martin who first crept up, and, looking over the\nsummit, gave notice to the others to come forward. This was continually\nrepeated for three or four miles, when Martin having raised his head\njust above a swell, made a signal to those who were below that the deer\nwere in sight. After a moment or two reconnoitering, he went down and\ninformed them that there were twelve or thirteen head of deer scraping\nup the snow about one hundred yards ahead of them upon another swell of\nthe land; but that they appeared to be alarmed and anxious, as if they\nhad an idea of danger being near.\n\nMalachi then again crawled up to make his observations, and returned.\n\n\"It is sartin,\" said he, \"that they are flurried about something; they\nappear just as if they had been hunted, and yet that is not likely. We\nmust wait and let them settle a little, and find out whether any other\nparties have been hunting them.\"\n\nThey waited about ten minutes, till the animals appeared more settled,\nand then, by altering their position behind the swell, gained about\ntwenty-five yards of distance. Malachi told each party which animal to\naim at, and they fired nearly simultaneously. Three of the beasts fell,\ntwo others were wounded, the rest of the herd bounded off like the wind.\nThey all rose from behind the swell, and ran forward to their prey.\nAlfred had fired at a fine buck which stood apart from the rest, and\nsomewhat further off; it was evident that the animal was badly wounded,\nand Alfred had marked the thicket into which it had floundered; but the\nother deer which was wounded was evidently slightly hurt, and there was\nlittle chance of obtaining it, as it bounded away after the rest of the\nherd. They all ran up to where the animals lay dead, and as soon as they\nhad reloaded their rifles, Alfred and Martin went on the track of the\none that was badly wounded. They had forced their way through the\nthicket for some fifty yards, guided by the track of the animal, when\nthey started back at the loud growl of some beast. Alfred, who was in\nadvance, perceived that a puma (catamount, or painter, as it is usually\ntermed) had taken possession of the deer, and was lying over the\ncarcass. He leveled his rifle and fired; the beast, although badly\nwounded, immediately sprang at him and seized him by the shoulder.\nAlfred was sinking under the animal's weight and from the pain he was\nsuffering, when Martin came to his rescue, and put his rifle ball\nthrough the head of the beast, which fell dead.\n\n\"Are you much hurt, sir?\" said Martin.\n\n\"No, not much,\" replied Alfred; \"at least I think not, but my shoulder\nis badly torn, and I bleed freely.\"\n\nMalachi and the others now came up, and perceived what had taken place.\nAlfred had sunk down and was sitting on the ground by the side of the\ndead animals.\n\n\"A painter!\" exclaimed Malachi; \"well, I didn't think we should see one\nso far west. Are you hurt, Mr. Alfred?\"\n\n\"Yes, a little,\" replied Alfred, faintly.\n\nMalachi and Martin, without saying another word, stripped off Alfred's\nhunting-coat, and then discovered that he had received a very bad wound\nin the shoulder from the teeth of the beast, and that his side was also\ntorn by the animal's claws.\n\n\"John, run for some water,\" said Malachi; \"you are certain to find some\nin the hollow.\"\n\nJohn and Percival both hastened in search of water, while Malachi and\nMartin and Henry tore Alfred's shirt into strips and bound up the\nwounds, so as to stop in a great measure the flow of blood. As soon as\nthis was done and he had drunk the water brought to him in John's hat,\nAlfred felt revived.\n\n\"I will sit down for a little longer,\" said he, \"and then we will get\nhome as fast as we can. Martin, look after the game, and when you are\nready I will get up. What a tremendous heavy brute that was; I could not\nhave stood against him for a minute longer, and I had no hunting-knife.\"\n\n\"It's a terrible beast, sir,\" replied Malachi. \"I don't know that I ever\nsaw one larger; they are more than a match for one man, sir, and never\nshould be attempted single-handed, for they are so hard to kill.\"\n\n\"Where did my ball hit him?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Here, sir, under the shoulder, and well placed too. It must have gone\nquite close to his heart; but unless you hit them through the brain or\nthrough the heart, they are certain to make their dying spring. That's\nan ugly wound on your shoulder, and will put a stop to your hunting for\nfive or six weeks, I expect. However, it's well that it's no worse.\"\n\n\"I feel quite strong now,\" replied Alfred.\n\n\"Another ten minutes, sir; let John and me whip off his skin, for we\nmust have it to show, if we have all the venison spoiled. Mr. Henry,\ntell Martin only to take the prime pieces, and not to mind the hides,\nfor we shall not be able to carry much. And tell him to be quick, Mr.\nHenry, for it will not do for Mr. Alfred to remain till his arm gets\nstiff. We have many miles to get home again.\"\n\nIn the course of ten minutes Malachi and John had skinned the puma, and\nMartin made his appearance with the haunches of two of the deer, which,\nhe said, was as much as they well could carry, and they all set off on\ntheir return home.\n\nAlfred had not proceeded far when he found himself in great pain, the\nwalking upon snow-shoes requiring so much motion as to open the wounds\nand make them bleed again; but Malachi gave him his assistance, and\nhaving procured him some more water they continued their route.\n\nAfter a time the wounds became more stiff, and Alfred appeared to be\nmore oppressed by the pain. They proceeded, however, as fast as they\ncould, and at nightfall they were not far from home. But Alfred moved\nwith great difficulty; he had become very faint, so much so, that Martin\nrequested John would put down the venison and hasten before them to the\nhouse to request Mr. Campbell to send some brandy or other cordial to\nsupport Alfred, who was scarcely able to move on from weakness and loss\nof blood. As they were not more than a mile from the house, John was\nsoon there, and hastening in at the door, he gave his message in\npresence of Mrs. Campbell and his cousins, who were in a state of great\ndistress at the intelligence. Mr. Campbell went to his room for the\nspirits, and as soon as he brought it out Emma seized her bonnet, and\nsaid that she would accompany John.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell had no time to raise any objection, if they were\ninclined, for Emma was out of the door in a moment, with John at her\nheels. But Emma quite forgot that she had no snow shoes, and before she\nhad gone half the distance she found herself as much fatigued as if she\nhad walked miles; and she sank deeper and deeper in the snow every step\nthat she advanced. At last they arrived, and found the party: Alfred was\nlying insensible on the snow, and the others making a litter of branches\nthat they might carry him to the house.\n\nA little brandy poured down his throat brought Alfred to his senses; and\nas he opened his eyes, he perceived Emma hanging over him.\n\n\"Dear Emma, how kind of you,\" said he, attempting to rise.\n\n\"Do not move, Alfred; they will soon have the litter ready, and then you\nwill be carried to the house. It is not far off.\"\n\n\"I am strong again now, Emma,\" replied Alfred. \"But you must not remain\nhere in the cold. See, the snow is falling again.\"\n\n\"I must remain now till they are ready to carry you, Alfred, for I dare\nnot go back by myself.\"\n\nBy this time the litter was prepared, and Alfred placed on it. Malachi,\nHenry, Martin and John took it up.\n\n\"Where is Percival?\" said Emma.\n\n\"He's behind a little way,\" replied John. \"The snow-shoes hurt him, and\nhe could not walk so fast. He will be here in a minute.\"\n\nThey carried Alfred to the house, where Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mary\nwere waiting at the door in great anxiety; poor Emma was quite knocked\nup by the time that they arrived, and went into her own room.\n\nAlfred was laid on his bed, and his father then examined his wounds,\nwhich he considered very dangerous, from the great laceration of the\nflesh. Mr. Campbell dressed them, and then they left Alfred to the\nrepose which he so much required. The state of Alfred so occupied their\nminds and their attention, that nothing and nobody else was thought of\nfor the first hour. Emma, too, had been taken very ill soon after she\ncame in, and required the attention of Mrs. Campbell and Mary. It was\nnot until they were about to sit down to supper that Mr. Campbell said,\n\"Why, where's Percival?\"\n\n\"Percival! Is he not here?\" was the question anxiously uttered by all\nthe party who had been hunting.\n\n\"Percival not here!\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell, starting up. \"Where--where\nis my child?\"\n\n\"He was just behind us,\" said John; \"he sat down to alter his\nsnow-shoes; the ties hurt him.\"\n\nMalachi and Martin ran out of doors in consternation; they knew the\ndanger, for the snow was now falling in such heavy flakes that it was\nimpossible to see or direct their steps two yards in any direction.\n\n\"The boy will be lost for sartin,\" said Malachi to Martin; \"if he has\nremained behind till this fall of snow, he never will find his way, but\nwander about till he perishes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Martin, \"he has but a poor chance, that is the truth; I\nwould have given my right arm this had not happened.\"\n\n\"Misfortune never comes single,\" replied Malachi; \"what can we do? Madam\nCampbell will be beside herself, for she loves that boy beyond all\nmeasure.\"\n\n\"It's useless our going out,\" observed Martin; \"we should never find\nhim, and only lose ourselves; but still we had better go back, and say\nthat we will try. At all events we can go to the edge of the forest, and\nhalloo every minute or so; if the boy is still on his legs, it will\nguide him to us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Malachi, \"and we may light a pine torch; it might be of\nsome use. Well, then, let's go in, and tell them that we are going in\nsearch of the boy; as long as madam knows that we are seeking him she\nwill not lose hope, and hope will keep up her spirits for the time, till\nshe is better prepared for her loss.\"\n\nThere was much good sense and knowledge of the human heart in the\nobservation of Malachi, who, although he was aware that all search would\nbe useless, could not resolve to destroy at once all hope in the mind of\nthe afflicted and anxious mother.\n\nThey went in, and found Mrs. Campbell weeping bitterly, supported by her\nhusband and Mary. They stated that they were going to search for the\nboy, and bring him home if they could, and, taking three or four pine\ntorches, one of which they lighted, they set off for the edge of the\nforest, where they remained for two hours with the light, shouting at\nintervals; but the snow fell so fast, and the cold was so intense, for\nthe wind blew fresh from the northward, that they could remain no\nlonger. They did not, however, return to the house, but went to their\nown lodge to recover themselves, and remained there till daylight. They\nthen went out again; the snow-storm had ceased, and the morning was\nclear and bright; they went back into the forest (on the road by which\nthey had come home) for three or four miles, but the snow had now fallen\nand covered all the tracks which they had made the day before, and was\nin many places several feet deep. They proceeded to where Percival was\nlast seen by John, who had described the spot very exactly; they looked\nevery where about, made circuits round and round, in hopes of perceiving\nthe muzzle of his rifle peeping out above the snow, but there was\nnothing to be discovered, and after a search of four or five hours, they\nreturned to the house. They found Mr. Campbell and Henry in the kitchen,\nfor Mrs. Campbell was in such a state of anxiety and distress, that she\nwas in her room attended by Mary. Mr. Campbell perceived by their\ncountenances that they brought no satisfactory tidings. Malachi shook\nhis head mournfully, and sat down.\n\n\"Do you think that my poor boy is lost, Malachi?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"He is, I fear, sir; he must have sat down to rest himself, and has been\noverpowered and fallen asleep. He has been buried in the snow, and he\nwill not wake till the day of resurrection.\"\n\nMr. Campbell covered his face with his hands, and after a time\nexclaimed, \"His poor mother!\"\n\nAfter a few minutes, he rose and went into Mrs. Campbell's room.\n\n\"What of my child,--my dear, dear Percival?\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,\" replied Mr. Campbell;\n\"your child is happy.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell wept bitterly; and having thus given vent to the feelings\nof nature, she became gradually more calm and resigned; her habitually\ndevout spirit sought and found relief in the God of all comfort.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\nThus in one short day was the family of Mr. Campbell changed from a\nhouse of joy to one of mourning. And true was the remark of Malachi,\nthat misfortunes seldom come single, for now they had another cause of\nanxiety. Emma, by her imprudent exposure to the intense chill of the\nnight air and the wetting of her feet, was first taken with a violent\ncold, which was followed by a fever, which became more alarming every\nday. Thus, in addition to the loss of one of their children, Mr. and\nMrs. Campbell were threatened with being deprived of two more; for their\nnieces were regarded as such, and Alfred was in a very precarious state.\nThe wounds had assumed such an angry appearance, that Mr. Campbell was\nfearful of mortification. This accumulated distress had, however, one\ngood effect upon them. The danger of losing Emma and Alfred so occupied\ntheir minds and their attention, that they had not time to bewail the\nloss of Percival; and even Mrs. Campbell, in her prayers, was enabled to\nresign herself to the Almighty's will in taking away her child, if it\nwould but please Him to spare the two others who were afflicted. Long\nand tedious were the hours, the days, and the weeks that passed away\nbefore either of them could be considered in a state of convalescence;\nbut when her prayers were heard, and, as the winter closed, their\nrecovery was no longer doubtful. A melancholy winter it had been to them\nall, but the joy of once more seeing Emma resume her duties, and Alfred,\nsupported on cushions, able to be moved into the sitting-room, had a\nvery exhilarating effect upon their spirits. True, there was no longer\nthe mirth and merriment that once reigned, but there was a subdued\ngratitude to Heaven, which, if it did not make them at once cheerful, at\nleast prevented any thing like repining or complaint. Grateful for the\nmercies vouchsafed to them, in having Alfred and Emma spared to them,\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell consoled themselves in reference to Percival, with\nthe reflection that, at so early an age, before he had lived to be\ncorrupted by the world, to die was gain,--and that their dear boy had\nbecome, through Divine grace, an inhabitant of the kingdom of Heaven. By\ndegrees the family became cheerful and happy; the merry laugh of Emma\nonce more enlivened them, Alfred again recovered his former health and\nspirits, and Mrs. Campbell could bear the mention of the name of\nPercival, and join in the praises of the amiable child.\n\nThe spring now came on, the snow gradually disappeared, the ice was\ncarried down the rapids, and once more left the blue lake clear; the\ncattle were turned out to feed off the grass the year before left on the\nprairie, and all the men were busy in preparing to put in the seed. As\nsoon as the snow was gone, Malachi, Martin and Alfred, without saying a\nword to Mrs. Campbell, had gone into the forest, and made search for the\nbody of poor Percival, but without success, and it was considered that\nhe had wandered and died on some spot which they could not discover, or\nthat the wolves had dug his remains out of the snow, and devoured them.\nNot a trace of him could any where be discovered; and the search was,\nafter a few days, discontinued. The return of the spring had another\ngood effect upon the spirits of the party; for, with the spring came on\nsuch a variety of work to be done, that they had not a moment to spare.\nThey had now so many acres for corn, that they had scarcely time to get\nthrough all the preparatory work, and fortunate it was that Alfred was\nso much recovered that he could join in the labor. Malachi, John, and\neven Mr. Campbell, assisted, and at last the task was completed. Then\nthey had a communication with the fort, and letters from Quebec,\nMontreal, and England: there were none of any importance from England,\nbut one from Montreal informed Mr. Campbell, that, agreeably to\ncontract, the engineer would arrive in the course of the month, with the\n_bateaux_ containing the machinery, and that the water-mill would be\nerected as soon as possible. There was also a letter from England, which\ngave them great pleasure; it was from Captain Sinclair to Alfred,\ninforming him that he had arranged all his business with his guardian,\nand that he should rejoin his regiment and be at the fort early in the\nspring, as he should sail in the first vessel which left England. He\nstated how delighted he should be at his return, and told him to say to\nEmma that he had not found an English wife, as she had prophesied, but\nwas coming back as heart-whole as he went. Very soon afterward they had\na visit from Colonel Forster and some of the officers of the garrison.\nThe Colonel offered Mr. Campbell a party of soldiers to assist in\nraising the mill, and the offer was thankfully accepted.\n\n\"We were very much alarmed about you last autumn, when the woods were on\nfire, Mr. Campbell,\" said the Colonel; \"but I perceive that it has been\nof great advantage to you. You have now a large quantity of cleared land\nsown with seed, and if you had possessed sufficient means, might have\nhad much more put in, as I perceive all the land to the north-west is\ncleared by the fire.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"but my allotment, as you know, extends\nalong the beach, and we have sown the seed as far from the beach as the\nproperty extends.\"\n\n\"Then I should recommend you to write to Quebec, and apply for another\ngrant on each side of the stream; indeed, at the back of and equal to\nwhat you now have.\"\n\n\"But if I do, I have not the means of working the land.\"\n\n\"No, not with your present force, I grant; but there are many emigrants\nwho would be glad of work, and who would settle here upon favorable\nconditions.\"\n\n\"The expense would be very great,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"It would; but the return would indemnify you. The troops at the fort\nwould take all the flour off your hands, if you had ever so much.\"\n\n\"I am not inclined at present to speculate much further,\" replied Mr.\nCampbell, \"but I shall see how this year turns out, and if I find that I\nam successful, I will then decide.\"\n\n\"Of course, you will but act prudently. You can send down to your agent\nat Quebec, and ascertain what would be the probable terms of the men you\nmight require. But there is another way, which is to give them the land\nto cultivate, and the seed, and to receive from them a certain portion\nof corn in return, as rent; that is very safe, and your land will be all\ngradually brought into cultivation, besides the advantage of having\nneighbors about you. You might send one of your sons down to Montreal,\nand arrange all that.\"\n\n\"I certainly will write to my agent and institute inquiries,\" replied\nMr. Campbell, \"and many thanks to you for the suggestion; I have still a\nfew hundred at the bank to dispose of, if necessary.\"\n\nAbout three weeks after this conversation, the _bateaux_ arrived with\nthe engineer and machinery for the flour and saw-mills: and now the\nsettlement again presented a lively scene, being thronged with the\nsoldiers who were sent from the fort. The engineer was a very pleasant,\nintelligent young Englishman, who had taken up his profession in Canada,\nand was considered one of the most able in the colony. The site of the\nmill was soon chosen, and now the axes again resounded in the woods, as\nthe trees were felled and squared under his directions. Alfred was\nconstantly with the engineer, superintending the labor of the men, and\ncontracted a great intimacy with him; indeed, that gentleman was soon on\nsuch a footing with the whole family, as to be considered almost as one\nof them, for he was very amusing, very well bred, and had evidently\nreceived every advantage of education. Mr. Campbell found that Mr.\nEmmerson, for such was his name, could give him every particular\nrelative to the emigrants who had come out, as he was so constantly\ntraveling about the country, and was in such constant communication with\nthem.\n\n\"You are very fortunate in your purchase,\" said he to Mr. Campbell; \"the\nland is excellent, and you have a good water-power in the stream, as\nwell as convenient carriage by the lake. Fifty years hence this property\nwill be worth a large sum of money.\"\n\n\"I want very much to get some more emigrants to settle here,\" observed\nMr. Campbell. \"It would add to our security and comfort; and I have not\nsufficient hands to cultivate the land which has been cleared by the\nfire of last autumn. If not cultivated in a short time, it will be all\nforest again.\"\n\n\"At present it is all raspberries, and very good ones too, are they not,\nMr. Emmerson?\" said Emma.\n\n\"Yes, miss, most excellent,\" replied he; \"but you are aware that,\nwhenever you cut down trees here, and do not hoe the ground to sow it,\nraspberry bushes grow up immediately.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I was not aware of it.\"\n\n\"Such is the case, nevertheless. After the raspberries, the seedling\nhardwood trees spring up, and, as Mr. Campbell says, they soon grow into\na forest again.\"\n\n\"I do not think that you would have much trouble in getting emigrants to\ncome here, Mr. Campbell, but the difficulty will be in persuading them\nto remain. Their object in coming out to this country is to obtain land\nof their own, and become independent. Many of them have not the means to\ngo on, and, as a temporary resource, are compelled to act as laborers;\nbut the moment that they get sufficient to purchase for themselves, they\nwill leave you.\"\n\n\"That is very natural; but I have been thinking of obtaining a larger\ngrant than I have now, and I wish very much that I could make an\narrangement with some emigrants. The Colonel says that I might do so by\nsupplying them with seed, and taking corn in return as rent.\"\n\n\"That would not be a permanent arrangement,\" replied Mr. Emmerson. \"How\nmuch land, do you propose applying for?\"\n\n\"Six hundred acres.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I think it would meet the views of both parties if you were\nto offer terms like the following--that is, divide the land into lots of\none hundred acres each, and allow them to cultivate for you the fifty\nacres that adjoin your own land, with the right of purchasing the other\nfifty as their own property, as soon as they can. You will then obtain\nthree hundred acres of the most valuable land, in addition to your\npresent farm, and have fixed neighbors around you, even after they are\nenabled to purchase the other fifty.\"\n\n\"I think that a very good arrangement, Mr. Emmerson, and I would gladly\nconsent to it.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I shall have plenty of opportunities this summer of making\nthe proposal to the emigrants, and if I find any parties who seem likely\nto prove advantageous as neighbors, I will let you know.\"\n\n\"And with such expectations I will apply for the additional grant,\" said\nMr. Campbell, \"for to have neighbors in this solitude, I would almost\nmake them a present of the land.\"\n\n\"I suspect that in a few years you will have neighbors enough, without\nresorting to such an expedient,\" replied Mr. Emmerson, \"but according to\nyour present proposal, they may be better selected, and you may make\nterms which will prevent any nuisances.\"\n\nThe works at the mill proceeded rapidly, and before the hay-harvest the\nmill was complete. Alfred was very careful, and paid every attention to\nwhat was going on, and so did Martin, that they might understand the\nmachinery. This was very simple. Mr. Emmerson tried the mill, and found\nit to answer well. He explained every thing to Alfred, and put the mill\nto work, that he might be fully master of it. As it was a fortnight\nafter the mill was at work before Mr. Emmerson could obtain a passage\nback to Montreal, Alfred and Martin worked both mills during that time,\nand felt satisfied that they required no further instruction. The\nsoldiers, at the request of Mr. Campbell, were allowed to remain till\nthe hay-harvest, and as soon as the hay was gathered in, they were paid\nand returned to the fort. Captain Sinclair, who, from his letter, had\nbeen expected to arrive much sooner, came just as the soldiers had left\nthe farm. It need hardly be said that he was received most warmly. He\nhad a great deal to tell them, and had brought out a great many\npresents; those for poor little Percival he kept back, of course. Emma\nand Mary were delighted to have him again as a companion, and to resume\ntheir walks with him; a fortnight thus passed away very quickly, when\nhis leave of absence expired, and he was obliged to return to the fort.\nPrevious, however, to his going away, he requested a private interview\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, in which he stated his exact position and\nhis means, and requested their sanction to his paying his addresses to\nMary. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, who had already perceived the attentions he\nhad shown to her, did not hesitate to express their satisfaction at his\nrequest, and their best wishes for his success; and having so done, they\nleft him to forward his own suit, which Captain Sinclair did not fail to\ndo that very evening, Mary Percival was too amiable and right-minded a\ngirl not at once to refuse or accept Captain Sinclair. As she had long\nbeen attached to him she did not deny that such was the case, and\nCaptain Sinclair was overjoyed at his success.\n\n\"I have spoken frankly to you, Captain Sinclair,\" said Mary; \"I have not\ndenied that you have an interest in my affections; but I must now\nrequest you to let me know what are your future views.\"\n\n\"To do just what you wish me to do.\"\n\n\"I have no right to advise, and no wish to persuade. I have my own path\nof duty pointed out to me, and from that I can not swerve.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"It is that, under present circumstances, I must not think of leaving my\nuncle and aunt. I have been bred up and educated by them; I have as an\norphan shared their prosperity; I have a deep debt of gratitude to pay,\nand I can not consent to return to England to enjoy all the advantages\nwhich your means will afford, while they remain in their present\nisolated position. Hereafter circumstances may alter my opinion, but\nsuch it is at present.\"\n\n\"But if I am willing to remain with you here to share your fortunes,\nwill not that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not; for that would be allowing you to do injustice to\nyourself. I presume you do not mean to quit your profession?\"\n\n\"I had no such intention; but still, if I have to choose between you and\nthe service, I shall not hesitate.\"\n\n\"I trust you will not hesitate, but determine to adhere steadily to your\nprofession for the present, Captain Sinclair. It will not do for you to\ngive up your prospects and chance of advancement for even such a woman\nas me,\" continued Mary, smiling; \"nor must you think of becoming a\nbackwoodsman for a pale-faced girl.\"\n\n\"Then what am I to do if, as you say, you will not leave your uncle and\naunt?\"\n\n\"Wait, Captain Sinclair; be satisfied that you have my affections, and\nwait patiently till circumstances may occur which will enable me to\nreward your affection without being guilty of ingratitude toward those\nto whom I owe so much. On such terms I accept you willingly; but you\nmust do your duty to yourself, while I must discharge _my_ duty toward\nmy uncle and aunt.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right, Mary,\" replied Captain Sinclair; \"only I do\nnot see any definite hope of our being united. Can you give me any\nprospect to cheer me?\"\n\n\"We are both very young, Captain Sinclair,\" observed Mary; \"in a year or\ntwo, my uncle and aunt may be less lonely and more comfortable than at\npresent. In a year or two the war may end, and you may honorably retire\nupon half-pay; in fact, so many chances are there which are hidden from\nus and come upon us so unexpectedly, that it is impossible to say what\nmay take place. And if, after waiting patiently for some time, none of\nthese chances do turn up, you have yet another in your favor.\"\n\n\"And what is that, Mary?\"\n\n\"That, perhaps, I may be tired of waiting myself,\" replied Mary, with a\nsmile.\n\n\"Upon that chance, then, I will live in hope,\" replied Captain Sinclair;\n\"if you will only reward me when you consider that my faithful service\ndemands it, I will serve as long as Jacob did for Rachel.\"\n\n\"Do so, and you shall not be deceived at the end of your services, as he\nwas,\" replied Mary; \"but now let us return to the house.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair departed the day afterward, quite satisfied with Mary's\nresolution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\nAs Henry had predicted, during the autumn the whole family were fully\nemployed. The stock had increased very much, they had a large number of\nyoung calves and heifers, and the sheep had lambed down very favorably.\nMany of the stock were now turned into the bush, to save the feed on the\nprairies. The sheep with their lambs, the cows which were in milk, and\nthe young calves only were retained. This gave them more leisure to\nattend to the corn harvest, which was now ready, and it required all\ntheir united exertions from daylight to sunset to get it in, for they\nhad a very large quantity of ground to clear. It was, however, got in\nvery successfully, and all stacked in good order. Then came the\nthrashing of the wheat, which gave them ample employment; and as soon as\nit could be thrashed out, it was taken to the mill in a wagon, and\nground down, for Mr. Campbell had engaged to supply a certain quantity\nof flour to the fort before the winter set in. They occasionally\nreceived a visit from Captain Sinclair and the Colonel, and some other\nofficers, for now they had gradually become intimate with many of them.\nCaptain Sinclair had confided to the Colonel his engagement to Mary\nPercival, and in consequence the Colonel allowed him to visit at the\nfarm as often as he could, consistently with his duty. The other\nofficers who came to see them, perceiving how much Captain Sinclair\nengrossed the company of Mary Percival, were very assiduous in their\nattentions to Emma, who laughed with and at them, and generally\ncontrived to give them something to do for her during their visit, as\nwell as to render their attentions serviceable to the household. On\ncondition that Emma accompanied them, they were content to go into the\npunt and fish for hours; and indeed, all the lake-fish which were caught\nthis year were taken by the officers. There were several very pleasant\nyoung men among them and they were always well received, as they added\nvery much to the society at the farm.\n\nBefore the winter set in the flour was all ready, and sent to the fort,\nas were the cattle which the Colonel requested, and it was very evident\nthat the Colonel was right when he said that the arrangement would be\nadvantageous to both parties. Mr. Campbell, instead of drawing money to\npay, this year for the first time received a bill on the government to a\nconsiderable amount for the flour and cattle furnished to the troops;\nand Mrs. Campbell's account for fowls, pork, etc., furnished to the\ngarrison, was by no means to be despised. Thus, by the kindness of\nothers, his own exertions, and a judicious employment of his small\ncapital, Mr. Campbell promised to be in a few years a wealthy and\nindependent man. As soon as the harvest was in, Malachi and John, who\nwere of no use in thrashing out the corn, renewed their hunting\nexpeditions, and seldom returned without venison. The Indians had not\nbeen seen by Malachi during his excursions, nor any trace of their\nhaving been in the neighborhood; all alarm, therefore, on that account\nwas now over, and the family prepared to meet the coming winter with all\nthe additional precautions which the foregoing had advised them of. But\nduring the Indian summer they received letters from England, detailing,\nas usual, the news relative to friends with whom they had been intimate;\nalso one from Quebec, informing Mr. Campbell that his application for\nthe extra grant of land was consented to; and another from Montreal,\nfrom Mr. Emmerson, stating that he had offered terms to two families of\nsettlers who bore very good characters, and if they were accepted by Mr.\nCampbell, the parties would join them at the commencement of the ensuing\nspring.\n\nThis was highly gratifying to Mr. Campbell, and as the terms were, with\na slight variation, such as he had proposed, he immediately wrote to Mr.\nEmmerson, agreeing to terms, and requesting that the bargain might be\nconcluded. At the same time that the Colonel forwarded the above\nletters, he wrote to Mr. Campbell to say that the interior of the fort\nrequired a large quantity of plank for repairs, that he was authorized\nto take them from Mr. Campbell, at a certain price, if he could afford\nto supply them on these terms, and have them ready by the following\nspring. This was another act of kindness on the part of the Colonel, as\nit would now give employment to the saw-mill for the winter, and it was\nduring the winter, and at the time that the snow was on the ground, that\nthey could easily drag the timber after it was felled to the saw-mill.\nMr. Campbell wrote an answer, thanking the Colonel for his offer, which\nhe accepted, and promised to have the planks ready by the time the lake\nwas again open.\n\nAt last the winter set in, with its usual fall of snow. Captain Sinclair\ntook his leave for a long time, much to the sorrow of all the family,\nwho were warmly attached to him. It was arranged that the only parties\nwho were to go on the hunting excursions should be Malachi and John, as\nHenry had ample employment in the barns; and Martin and Alfred, in\nfelling timber, and dragging up the stems to the saw-mill, would, with\nattending to the mill as well, have their whole time taken up. Such were\nthe arrangements out of doors, and now that they had lost the services\nof poor Percival, and the duties to attend to in doors were so much\nincreased, Mrs. Campbell and the girls were obliged to call in the\nassistance of Mr. Campbell whenever he could be spared from the garden,\nwhich was his usual occupation. Thus glided on the third winter in quiet\nand security; but in full employment, and with so much to do and attend\nto, that it passed very rapidly.\n\nIt was in the month of February, when the snow was very heavy on the\nground, that one day Malachi went up to the mill to Alfred, whom he\nfound alone attending the saws, which were in full activity; for Martin\nwas squaring out the timber ready to be sawed at about one hundred\nyards' distance.\n\n[THE INDIAN LETTER.]\n\n\"I am glad to find you alone, sir,\" said Malachi, \"for I have something\nof importance to tell you of, and I do not like at present that any\nbody else should know any thing about it.\"\n\n\"What is it, Malachi?\" inquired Alfred.\n\n\"Why, sir, when I was out hunting yesterday, I went round to a spot\nwhere I had left a couple of deer-hides last week, that I might bring\nthem home, and I found a letter stuck to them with a couple of thorns.\"\n\n\"A letter, Malachi!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, an Indian letter. Here it is.\" Malachi then produced a piece\nof birch bark, of which the underneath drawing is a fac-simile.\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Alfred, \"it may be a letter, but I confess it is all Greek\nto me. I certainly do not see why you wish to keep it a secret. Tell\nme.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I could not read one of your letters half so well as I can\nthis; and it contains news of the greatest importance. It's the Indian\nway of writing, and I know also whom it comes from. A good action is\nnever lost, they say, and I am glad to find that there is some\ngratitude in an Indian.\"\n\n\"You make me very impatient, Malachi, to know what it means; tell me\nfrom whom do you think the letter comes?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, do you see this mark here?\" said Malachi, pointing to one of\nthe lowest down on the piece of bark.\n\n\"Yes; it is a foot, is it not?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir; now, do you know whom it comes from?\"\n\n\"I can't say I do.\"\n\n\"Do you remember two winters back our picking up the Indian woman, and\ncarrying her to the house, and your father curing her sprained ankle?\"\n\n\"Certainly; is it from her?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and you recollect she said that she belonged to the band\nwhich followed the Angry Snake.\"\n\n\"I remember it very well; but now, Malachi, read me the letter at once,\nfor I am very impatient to know what she can have to say.\"\n\n\"I will, Mr. Alfred; now, sir, there is the sun more than half up, which\nwith them points out it is the setting and not the rising sun; the\nsetting sun therefore means to the westward.\"\n\n\"Very good, that is plain, I think.\"\n\n\"There are twelve wigwams, that is, twelve days' journey for a warrior,\nwhich the Indians reckon at about fifteen miles a day. How much does\nfifteen times twelve make, sir?\"\n\n\"One hundred and eighty, Malachi.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, then that is to say that it is one hundred and eighty miles\noff, or thereabouts. Now, the first figure is a chief, for it has an\neagle's feather on the head of it, and the snake before it is his\n_totem_, 'the Angry Snake,' and the other six are the number of the\nband; and you observe, that the chief and the first figure of the six\nhave a gun in their hands, which is to inform us that they have only two\nrifles among them.\"\n\n\"Very true; but what is that little figure following the chief with his\narms behind him?\"\n\n\"There is the whole mystery of the letter, sir, without which it were\nworth nothing. You perceive that little figure has a pair of snow-shoes\nover it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Well, that little figure is your brother Percival, whom we supposed to\nbe dead.\"\n\n\"Merciful heavens! is it possible?\" exclaimed Alfred; \"then he is\nalive?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"and now I will put the\nwhole letter together. Your brother Percival has been carried off by the\nAngry Snake and his band, and has been taken to some place one hundred\nand eighty miles to the westward, and this information comes from the\nIndian woman who belongs to the band, and whose life was preserved by\nyour kindness. I don't think, Mr. Alfred, that any white person could\nhave written a letter more plain and more to the purpose.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Malachi; but the news has so overpowered me, I am so\nagitated with joy and anxiety of mind, that I hardly know what to say.\nPercival alive! we'll have him, if we have to go one thousand miles and\nbeat two thousand Indians. Oh, how happy it will make my mother! But\nwhat are we to do, Malachi? tell me, I beseech you.\"\n\n\"We must do nothing, sir,\" replied Malachi.\n\n\"Nothing, Malachi!\" replied Alfred with surprise.\n\n\"No, sir; nothing at present, at all events. We have the information\nthat the boy is alive, at least it is presumed so; but of course the\nIndians do not know that we have received such information; if they did,\nthe woman would be killed immediately. Now, sir, the first question we\nmust ask ourselves is, why they have carried off the boy; for it would\nbe no use carrying off a little boy in that manner without some object.\"\n\n\"It is the very question that _I_ was going to put to you, Malachi.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I'll answer it to the best of my knowledge and belief. It is\nthis: the Angry Snake came to the settlement, and saw our stores of\npowder and shot, and every thing else. He would have attacked us last\nwinter if he had found an opportunity and a chance of success. One of\nhis band was killed, which taught him that we were on the watch, and he\nfailed in that attempt: he managed, however, to pick up the boy when he\nwas lagging behind us, at the time you were wounded by the painter, and\ncarried him off, and he intends to drive a bargain for his being\nrestored to us. That is my conviction.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt but that you are right, Malachi,\" said Alfred, after a\npause. \"Well, we must make a virtue of necessity, and give him what he\nasks.\"\n\n\"Not so, sir; if we did, it would encourage him to steal again.\"\n\n\"What must we do then?\"\n\n\"Punish him, if we can; at all events, we must wait at present, and do\nnothing. Depend upon it we shall have some communication made to us\nthrough him that the boy is in their possession, and will be restored\nupon certain conditions--probably this spring. It will then be time to\nconsider what is to be done.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right, Malachi.\"\n\n\"I hope to circumvent him yet, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"but we shall\nsee.\"\n\n\"Well; but, Malachi, are we to let this be known to any body, or keep it\na secret?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I've thought of that; we must only let Martin and Strawberry\ninto the secret; and I would tell them, because they are almost Indians,\nas it were; they may have some one coming to them, and there's no fear\nof their telling. Martin knows better, and as for the Strawberry, she is\nas safe as if she didn't know it.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right; and still what delight it would give my father\nand mother!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and all the family too, I have no doubt, for the first hour\nor two after you had told them; but what pain it would give them for\nmonths afterward. 'Hope deferred maketh the heart sick,' as my father\nused to read out of the Bible, and that's the truth, sir. Only consider\nhow your father, and particularly your mother, would fret and pine\nduring the whole time, and what a state of anxiety they would be in;\nthey would not eat or sleep. No, no, sir; it would be a cruelty to tell\nthem, and it must not be. Nothing can be done till the spring, at all\nevents, and we must wait till the messenger comes to us.\"\n\n\"You are right, Malachi; then do as you say, make the communication to\nMartin and his wife,--and I will keep the secret as faithfully as they\nwill.\"\n\n\"It's a great point our knowing whereabouts the boy is,\" observed\nMalachi; \"for if it is necessary to make a party to go for him, we know\nwhat direction to go in. And it is also a great point to know the\nstrength of the enemy, as now we shall know what force we must take with\nus in case it is necessary to recover the lad by force or stratagem. All\nthis we gained from the letter, and shall not learn from any messenger\nsent to us by the Angry Snake, whose head I hope to bruise before I've\ndone with him.\"\n\n\"If I meet him, one of us shall fall,\" observed Alfred.\n\n\"No doubt, sir, no doubt,\" replied Malachi, \"but if we can retake the\nboy by other means, so much the better. A man, bad or good, has but one\nlife and God gave it to him. It is not for his fellow-creatures to take\nit away unless from necessity. I hope to have the boy without shedding\nof blood.\"\n\n\"I am willing to have him back upon any terms, Malachi; and, as you say,\nif we can do it without shedding of blood, all the better; but have him\nI will, if I have to kill a hundred Indians.\"\n\n\"That's right, sir; that's right; only let it be the last resort;\nrecollect the Indian seeks the powder and ball, not the life of the boy;\nand recollect if we had not been so careless as to tempt him with the\nsight of what he values so much, he never would have annoyed us thus.\"\n\n\"That is true; well then, Malachi, it shall be as you propose in every\nthing.\"\n\nThe conversation was here finished; Alfred and all those who were\npossessed of the secret never allowed the slightest hint to drop of\ntheir knowledge. The winter passed away without interruption of any\nkind. Before the snow had disappeared the seed was all prepared ready\nfor sowing; the planks had been sawed out, and all the wheat not\nrequired for seed had been ground down and put into flour-barrels, ready\nfor any further demand from the fort. And thus terminated the third\nwinter in Canada.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\nIt was now April, and for some days Malachi and John had been very busy,\nassisted by the Strawberry; for the time had come for tapping the\nmaple-trees, to make the maple-sugar, and Mrs. Campbell had expressed a\nwish that she could be so supplied with an article of such general\nconsumption, and which they could not obtain but by the _bateaux_ which\nwent to Montreal. In the evening, when Malachi and John were, as usual,\nemployed in cutting small trays out of the soft wood of the balsam-fir,\nand of which they had already prepared a large quantity, Mrs. Campbell\nasked Malachi how the sugar was procured.\n\n\"Very easily, ma'am: we tap the trees.\"\n\n\"Yes, so you said before; but how do you do it? Explain the whole affair\nto me.\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, we pick out the maple trees which are about a foot wide at\nthe bottom of the trunk, as they yield most sugar. We then bore a hole\nin the trunk of the tree, about two feet above the ground, and into that\nhole we put a hollow reed, just the same as you would put a spigot in a\ncask. The liquor runs out into one of these trays that we have been\ndigging out.\"\n\n\"Well, and then what do you do?\"\n\n\"We collect all the liquor every morning till we have enough to fill the\ncoppers, and then we boil it down.\"\n\n\"What coppers will you use, then?\"\n\n\"There are two large coppers in the store-room, not yet put up, which\nwill answer our purpose very well, ma'am. They hold about a hogshead\neach. We shall take them into the woods with us, and pour the liquor\ninto them, and boil them down as soon as they are ready. You must come\nand see us on the boiling-day, and we can have a frolic in the woods.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" replied Mrs. Campbell. \"How much liquor do you get\nfrom one tree?\"\n\n\"A matter of two or three gallons,\" replied Malachi; \"sometimes more and\nsometimes less. After we have tapped the trees and set our trays, we\nshall have nothing more to do for a fortnight. The Strawberry can attend\nto them all, and will let us know when she is ready.\"\n\n\"Do you tap the trees every year?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, and a good tree will bear it for fifteen or twenty years;\nbut it kills them at last.\"\n\n\"So I should suppose, for you take away so much of the sap of the tree.\"\n\n\"Exactly, ma'am; but there's no want of sugar-maples in these woods.\"\n\n\"You promised us some honey, Malachi,\" said Emma, \"but we have not seen\nit yet. Can you get us some?\"\n\n\"We had no time to get it last autumn, miss, but we will try this autumn\nwhat we can do. When John and I are out in the woods, we shall very\nprobably find a honey-tree, without going very far. I did intend to have\nlooked out for some, if you had not mentioned it.\"\n\n\"I know one,\" said Martin, \"I marked it a fortnight ago, but I quite\nforgot all about it. Since the mill has been in hand, I have had little\ntime for any thing else. The fact is, we have all plenty to do just\nnow.\"\n\n\"That we certainly have,\" replied Henry, laughing; \"I wish I could see\nthe end of my work in the barn; I doubt if I shall be able to get out\nwith my rifle this winter.\"\n\n\"No, sir, you must leave the woods to John and me,\" replied Malachi.\n\"Never mind, you shan't want for venison. Do you require the sledge\nto-morrow, Mr. Alfred?\"\n\nMalachi referred to a small sledge which they had made in the winter,\nand which was now very useful, as they could, with one horse, transport\nthings from place to place. It was used by Alfred for bringing down to\nthe storehouse the sacks of flour as fast as they were ground in the\nmill.\n\n\"I can do without it for a day. What do you want it for?\"\n\n\"To bring all the honey home,\" said Emma laughing.\n\n\"No, miss, to take the coppers out into the woods,\" replied Malachi,\n\"that they may be ready for the liquor. As soon as we have tapped the\ntrees, we will look for the honey.\"\n\n\"Did you send your skins down to Montreal by the _bateaux_?\" inquired\nMr. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, father,\" replied Alfred; \"Mr. Emmerson took charge of them, and\npromised to deliver them to the agent; but we have not so many this year\nas we had last. John has the largest package of all of us.\"\n\n\"Yes, he beats me this year,\" said Malachi; \"he always contrives to get\nthe first shot. I knew that I should make a hunter of the boy. He might\ngo out by himself now, and do just as well as I do.\"\n\nThe next morning Malachi went out into the woods, taking with him the\ncoppers and all the trays on the sledge: during that day he was busy\nboring the trees and fitting the reed-pipes to the holes. Strawberry and\nJohn accompanied him, and by sunset their work was complete.\n\nThe next morning when they went out, only Malachi and John took their\naxes with them, for John could use his very well for so young a lad.\nThey first went to the tree which Martin had discovered; he had given a\ndescription where to find it. They cut it down, but did not attempt to\ntake the honey till the night, when they lighted a fire, and drove away\nthe bees by throwing leaves upon it, and making a great smoke; they then\nopened the tree, and gained about two pails full of honey, which they\nbrought in just as the family were about to go to bed. When they went\nout the next morning, they found a bear very busy at the remains of the\ncomb, but the animal made off before they could get a shot at him.\n\nEvery morning the Strawberry collected all the sap which had run out of\nthe trees, and poured it into the coppers which had been fixed up by\nMalachi, ready for a fire to be lighted under them. They continued their\nsearch, and found three more hives of bees, which they marked and\nallowed to remain till later in the season, when they could take them\nat their leisure. In a fortnight, they had collected sufficient liquor\nfrom the trees to fill both the coppers to the brim, besides several\npails. The fires were therefore lighted under the coppers, and due\nnotice given to Mrs. Campbell and the girls, that the next day they must\ngo out into the woods and see the operation; as the liquor would, toward\nthe afternoon, be turned into coolers, which were some of the large\nwashing-tubs then in use, and which had been thoroughly cleansed for the\npurpose.\n\nAs this was to be a holiday in the woods, they prepared a cold dinner in\na large basket, and gave it in charge of Henry. Mr. Campbell joined the\nparty, and they all set off to the spot, which was about two miles\ndistant. On their arrival, they examined the trees and the trays into\nwhich the juice first ran, the boilers in which the liquor was now\nsimmering over the fire, and asked questions of Malachi, so that they\nmight, if necessary, be able to make the sugar themselves, after which\nthe first cooler was filled with the boiling liquor, that they might see\nhow the sugar crystallized as the liquor became cold. They then sat down\nunder a large tree and dined. The tree was at some distance from the\nboilers, as there was no shade in the open spot where Malachi had placed\nthem, and the afternoon was passed very agreeably in listening to\nMalachi's and Martin's stories of their adventures in the woods. While\nthey were still at dinner, Oscar and the other dogs which had\naccompanied them had strayed to about a hundred yards distant, and were\nsoon very busy scraping and barking at a large hole.\n\n\"What are the dogs after?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Just what the Strawberry wants, and told me to get for her,\" replied\nMalachi; \"we'll dig him out to-morrow.\"\n\n\"What is it, Strawberry?\" said Mary.\n\nThe Strawberry pointed to her moccasins, and then put her finger on the\nporcupine-quills with which they were embroidered.\n\n\"I don't know the English name,\" said she, softly.\n\n\"A porcupine you mean,\" said Mary, \"the animal those quills come from.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Strawberry.\n\n\"Is there a porcupine there, Malachi?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, that is certain; the dogs know that well enough, or they\nwould not make such a noise. If you like, we will go for the shovels and\ndig him out.\"\n\n\"Do, pray; I should like to see him caught,\" said Emma, \"it shall be our\nevening's amusement.\"\n\nMartin got up and went for the shovels; during his absence, the dinner\nwas cleared away, and the articles replaced in the basket; they then all\nadjourned to where the dogs were still barking and scratching.\n\nIt was more than an hour before they could dig out the animal, and when\nat last it burst away from the hole, they could not help laughing as\nthey witnessed the way in which one or two of the dogs were pricked with\nthe quills of the animal, who needed no other defense; the dogs ran\nback, pawed their noses, and then went on again. Oscar was too knowing\nto attack it in that way; he attempted to turn it over, so that he might\nget at its stomach, when he would soon have killed it, but Martin\ndispatched the poor beast with a blow on the nose, and the dogs then\nrushed in upon it. They amused themselves selecting all the best of the\nquills for the Strawberry, and then they went back again to the coolers,\nto see the sugar which had been made.\n\nAs they neared the spot, Emma cried out, \"There is a bear at the cooler;\nlook at him.\"\n\nMalachi and John had their rifles ready immediately. Mrs. Campbell and\nMary were much alarmed, as the animal was not one hundred yards from\nthem.\n\n\"Do not be afraid, ma'am,\" said Malachi; \"the animal is only after the\nsugar. He likes sugar just as well as honey.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt but he's the same beast that you saw at the honeycomb the\nother day,\" said Martin. \"Let us stay where we are, and watch him. We\nmay lose a few pounds of sugar, but I expect he will make you laugh.\"\n\n\"I really see nothing laughable in such a terrific brute,\" said Mrs.\nCampbell.\n\n\"You are quite safe, ma'am,\" said Martin, \"Malachi and Mr. John have\nboth their rifles.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will trust to them,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"but I should\nprefer being at home, nevertheless. What a great brute it is.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; it is a very large animal, that's certain; but they are not\nvery fat at this time of the year. See how he's smelling at the liquor,\nnow he's licking the top of it with his tongue. He won't be satisfied\nwith that, now that he has once tasted it. I told you so.\"\n\nThe eyes of the whole party, some frightened and some not, were now\nfixed upon the bear, who, approving of what he had tasted as a sample,\nnow proceeded to help himself more liberally.\n\nHe therefore placed his paw down into the contents of the cooler, but\nalthough the surface of the liquor was cool, the lower part was still\nscalding hot, and he had not put his paw in for a moment, when he\nwithdrew it with a loud roar, rearing up and sitting upon his hind legs,\nand throwing his burned paw in the air.\n\n\"I said so,\" observed Malachi, chuckling; \"he has found it hotter than\nhe expected.\"\n\nJohn, Alfred, and Martin burst out laughing at the sight; and even Mrs.\nCampbell and the two girls could not help being amused.\n\n\"He'll try it again,\" said Martin.\n\n\"Yes, that he will,\" replied Malachi. \"John, be all ready with your\nrifle, for the brute has seen us.\"\n\n\"Why, he won't come this way, will he?\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, that he most likely will when he is angry; but you need not\nfear.\"\n\n\"But I'm afraid, Malachi,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Then perhaps you had better go about fifty yards back with Mr.\nCampbell, where you will see the whole without danger. There he goes to\nit again; I knew he would.\"\n\nMartin, who had got all the dogs collected together and fast by a piece\nof deer's hide, as soon as they had discovered the bear, went back with\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell and the girls.\n\n\"You need have no fear, ma'am,\" said Martin; \"the rifles won't miss\ntheir mark, and if they did, I have the dogs to let loose upon him; and\nI think Oscar, with the help of the others, would master him.\nDown--silence, Oscar--down, dogs, down. Look at the Strawberry, ma'am,\nshe's not afraid, she's laughing like a silver bell.\"\n\nDuring this interval, the bear again applied to the cooler, and burned\nhimself as before, and this time being more angry, he now gave another\nroar, and, as if considering that the joke had been played upon him by\nthe party who were looking on, he made directly for them at a quick run.\n\n\"Now, John,\" said Malachi, \"get your bead well on him, right between his\neyes.\"\n\nJohn kneeled down in front of Malachi, who had his rifle all ready; much\nto the horror of Mrs. Campbell, John permitted the bear to come within\ntwenty yards of him. He then fired, and the animal fell dead without a\nstruggle.\n\n\"A good shot, and well put in,\" said Malachi, going up to the bear. \"Let\nthe dogs loose, Martin, that they may worry the carcass; it will do them\ngood.\"\n\nMartin did so; the dogs were permitted to pull and tear at the dead\nanimal for a few minutes, and then taken off; in the mean time, Mr.\nCampbell and the ladies had come up to where the animal lay.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, isn't John a cool shot?\" said Malachi, \"Could the oldest\nhunter have done better?\"\n\n\"My dear John, you quite frightened me,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"why did\nyou allow the beast to come so near to you?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted to kill him dead, and not wound him,\" replied John.\n\n\"To be sure,\" replied Malachi; \"to wound a bear is worse than leaving\nhim alone.\"\n\n\"Well, Malachi, you certainly have made a hunter of John,\" said Mr.\nCampbell. \"I could not have supposed such courage and presence of mind\nin one so young.\"\n\nJohn was very much praised, as he deserved to be, by the whole party;\nand then Malachi said, \"The skin belongs to John, that of course.\"\n\n\"Is the bear good eating now?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Not very, ma'am,\" replied Malachi, \"for he has consumed all his fat\nduring the winter; but we will cut off the legs for hams, and when they\nare salted and smoked with the other meat, you will acknowledge that a\nbear's ham is, at all events, a dish that any one may say is good. Come,\nJohn, where's your knife? Martin, give us a hand here, while Mr.\nCampbell and the ladies go home.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\nIt was in the first week of June that Malachi, when he was out in the\nwoods, perceived an Indian, who came toward him. He was a youth of about\ntwenty or twenty-one years old, tall and slightly made; he carried his\nbow and arrows and his tomahawk, but had no gun. Malachi was at that\ntime sitting down on the trunk of a fallen tree; he was not more than\ntwo miles from the house, and had gone out with his rifle without any\nparticular intent, unless it was that, as he expected he should soon\nreceive some communication from the Indians, he wished to give them an\nopportunity of speaking to him alone. The Indian came up to where\nMalachi was, and took a seat by him, without saying a word.\n\n\"Is my son from the West?\" said Malachi, in the Indian tongue, after a\nsilence of one or two minutes.\n\n\"The Young Otter is from the West,\" replied the Indian. \"The old men\nhave told him of the Gray Badger, who has lived the life of a snake, and\nwho has hunted with the fathers of those who are now old. Does my father\nlive with the white man?\"\n\n\"He lives with the white man,\" replied Malachi; \"he has no Indian blood\nin his veins.\"\n\n\"Has the white man many in his lodge?\" said the Indian.\n\n\"Yes; many young men and many rifles,\" replied Malachi.\n\nThe Indian did not continue this conversation, and there was a silence\nof some minutes. Malachi was convinced that the young Indian had been\nsent to intimate that Percival was alive and in captivity, and he\nresolved to wait patiently till he brought up the subject.\n\n\"Does not the cold kill the white man?\" said the Indian, at last.\n\n\"No; the white man can bear the winter's ice as well as an Indian. He\nhunts as well, and brings home venison.\"\n\n\"Are all who came here with him now in the white man's lodge?\"\n\n\"No, not all; one white child slept in the snow, and is in the land of\nspirits,\" replied Malachi.\n\nHere there was a pause in the conversation for some minutes; at last the\nyoung Indian said--\n\n\"A little bird sang in my ear, and it said, The white man's child is not\ndead; it wandered about in the woods and was lost, and the Indian found\nhim, and took him to his wigwam in the far west.\"\n\n\"Did not the little bird lie to the Young Otter?\" replied Malachi.\n\n\"No; the little bird sang what was true,\" replied the Indian. \"The white\nboy is alive and in the lodge of the Indian.\"\n\n\"There are many white men in the country who have children,\" replied\nMalachi; \"and children are often lost. The little bird may have sung of\nthe child of some other white man.\"\n\n\"The white boy had a rifle in his hand and snow-shoes on his feet.\"\n\n\"So have all they who go out to hunt in the winter's snow,\" replied\nMalachi.\n\n\"But the white boy was found near to the white man's lodge.\"\n\n\"Then why was not the boy taken back to the white man by the Indians who\nfound him?\"\n\n\"They were going to their own wigwams and could not turn aside; besides,\nthey feared to come near to the white man's lodge after the sun was\ndown; as my father says he has many young men and many rifles.\"\n\n\"But the white man does not raise his rifle against the Indian, whether\nhe comes by day or by night,\" replied Malachi. \"At night he kills the\nprowling wolf when he comes near to the lodge.\"\n\nThe Indian again stopped and was silent. He knew by the words of Malachi\nthat the wolf's skin, with which the Indian had been covered when he was\ncrawling to the palisades and had been shot by John, had been\ndiscovered. Malachi after a while renewed the conversation.\n\n\"Is the Young Otter of a near tribe?\"\n\n\"The lodges of our tribe are twelve days' journey to the westward,\"\nreplied the Indian.\n\n\"The chief of the Young Otter's band is a great warrior?\"\n\n\"He is,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Malachi, \"The 'Angry Snake' is a great warrior. Did he\nsend the Young Otter to me to tell me that the white boy was alive and\nin his wigwam?\"\n\nThe Indian again paused. He perceived that Malachi knew where he came\nfrom, and from whom. At last he said--\n\n\"It is many moons since the Angry Snake has taken care of the white boy,\nand has fed him with venison; many moons that he has hunted for him to\ngive him food; and the white boy loves the Angry Snake as a father, and\nthe Angry Snake loves the boy as his son. He will adopt him, and the\nwhite boy will be the chief of the tribe. He will forget the white men,\nand become red as an Indian.\"\n\n\"The boy is forgotten by the white man, who has long numbered him with\nthe dead,\" replied Malachi.\n\n\"The white man has no memory,\" replied the Indian, \"to forget so soon;\nbut it is not so. He would make many presents to him who would bring\nback the boy.\"\n\n\"And what presents could he make?\" replied Malachi; \"the white man is\npoor, and hunts with his young men as the Indian does. What has the\nwhite man to give that the Indian covets? He has no whisky.\"\n\n\"The white man has powder, and lead, and rifles,\" replied the Indian;\n\"more than he can use, locked up in his storehouse.\"\n\n\"And will the Angry Snake bring back the white boy if the white man\ngives him powder, and lead, and rifles?\" inquired Malachi.\n\n\"He will make a long journey, and bring the white boy with him,\" replied\nthe Indian; \"but first let the white man say what presents he will\ngive.\"\n\n\"He shall be spoken to,\" replied Malachi, \"and his answer shall be\nbrought, but the Young Otter must not go to the white man's lodge. A\nred-skin is not safe from the rifles of the young men. When the moon is\nat the full I will meet the Young Otter after the sun is down, at the\neastern side of the long prairie. Is it good?\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied the Indian, who rose, turned on his heel, and walked\naway into the forest.\n\nWhen Malachi returned to the house, he took an opportunity of\ncommunicating to Alfred what had taken place. After some conversation,\nthey agreed that they would make Captain Sinclair, who had that morning\narrived from the fort, their confidant as to what had occurred, and\ndecide with him upon what steps should be taken. Captain Sinclair was\nvery much surprised, and equally delighted, when he heard that Percival\nwas still alive, and warmly entered into the subject.\n\n\"The great question is, whether it would not be better to accede to the\nterms of this scoundrel of an Indian chief,\" observed Captain Sinclair.\n\"What are a few pounds of powder and a rifle or two compared with the\nhappiness which will be produced by the return of Percival to his\nparents, who have so long lamented him as dead?\"\n\n\"It's not that, sir,\" replied Malachi. \"I know that Mr. Campbell would\ngive his whole store-room to regain his boy, but we must consider what\nwill be the consequence if he does so. One thing is certain, that the\nAngry Snake will not be satisfied with a trifling present; he will ask\nmany rifles, perhaps more than we have at the farm, and powder and shot\nin proportion; for he has mixed much with white people, especially when\nthe French were here, and he knows how little we value such things, and\nhow much we love our children. But, sir, in the first place, you supply\nhim and his band with arms to use against us at any other time, and\nreally make them formidable; and in the next place, you encourage him to\nmake some other attempt to obtain similar presents--for he will not be\nidle. Recollect, sir, that we have in all probability killed one of\ntheir band, when he came to reconnoiter the house in the skin of a wolf,\nand that will never be forgotten, but revenged as soon as it can be.\nNow, sir, if we give him arms and ammunition, we shall put the means of\nrevenge in his hands, and I should not be surprised to find us one day\nattacked by him and his band, and it may be, overpowered by means of\nthese rifles which you propose to give him.\"\n\n\"There is much truth and much good sense in what you say,\nMalachi--indeed, I think it almost at once decides the point, and that\nwe must not consent to his terms; but then what must we do to recover\nthe boy?\"\n\n\"That is the question which puzzles me,\" replied Alfred, \"for I\nperfectly agree with Malachi, that we must not give him arms and\nammunition, and I doubt if he would accept of any thing else.\"\n\n\"No, sir, that he will not, depend upon it,\" replied Malachi. \"I think\nthere is but one way that will give us a chance.\"\n\n\"What, then, is your idea, Malachi?\"\n\n\"The Angry Snake with his band were tracking us, and had we not been too\nstrong, would have attacked and murdered us all, that is clear. Not\ndaring to do that, he has stolen Percival, and detains him, to return\nhim at his own price. Now, sir, the Young Otter has come to us, and\noffers to come again. We have given him no pledge of safe conduct, and,\ntherefore, when he comes again, we must have an ambush ready for him,\nand make him prisoner; but then you see, sir, we must have the\nassistance of the Colonel, for he must be confined at the fort; we could\nnot well keep him at the farm. In the first place, it would be\nimpossible then to withhold the secret from Mr. and Mrs. Campbell; and,\nin the next, we should have to be on the look-out for an attack every\nnight for his rescue; but if the Colonel was to know the whole\ncircumstances, and would assist us, we might capture the Indian lad and\nhold him as a hostage for Master Percival, till we could make some terms\nwith the Angry Snake.\"\n\n\"I like your idea very much, Malachi,\" replied Captain Sinclair, \"and\nif, Alfred, you agree with me, I will acquaint the Colonel with the\nwhole of what has passed when I return to-night, and see if he will\nconsent to our taking such a step. When are you to meet the Indian,\nMalachi?\"\n\n\"In three days, that is on Saturday; it will be the full of the moon,\nand then I meet him at night, at the end of the prairie nearest to the\nfort, so that there will be no difficulty in doing all we propose\nwithout Mr. and Mrs. Campbell being aware of any thing that has taken\nplace.\"\n\n\"I think we can not do better than you have proposed,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Be it so, then,\" said Captain Sinclair. \"I will be here again\nto-morrow--no, not to-morrow, but the day after will be better, and then\nI will give you the reply of the Colonel, and make such arrangements as\nmay be necessary.\"\n\n\"That's all right, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"and now all we have to do is\nto keep our own secret; so, perhaps, Captain Sinclair, you had better go\nback to the young ladies, for Miss Mary may imagine that it must be\nsomething of very great importance which can have detained you so long\nfrom her presence;\" and Malachi smiled as he finished his remark.\n\n\"There's good sense in that observation, Malachi,\" said Alfred,\nlaughing. \"Come, Sinclair.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair quitted in the evening, and went back to the fort. He\nreturned at the time appointed, and informed them that the Colonel fully\napproved of their plan of holding the young Indian as a hostage, and\nthat he would secure him in the fort as soon as he was brought in.\n\n\"Now, do we want any assistance from the fort? Surely not to capture an\nIndian lad; at least, so I said to the Colonel,\" continued Captain\nSinclair.\n\n\"No, sir, we want no assistance, as you say. I am his match, myself, if\nthat were all; but it is not strength which is required. He is as little\nand supple as an eel, and as difficult to hold, that I am certain of. If\nwe were to use our rifles, there would be no difficulty, but to hold him\nwould give some trouble to two of us, and if once he breaks loose, he\nwill be too fleet for any of us.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Malachi, how shall we proceed?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I must meet him, and you and Mr. Alfred and Martin must be\nhid at a distance, and gradually steal near to us. Martin shall have his\ndeer thongs all ready, and when you pounce upon him, he must bind him at\nonce. Martin is used to them and knows how to manage it.\"\n\n\"Well, if you think that we three can not manage him, let us have\nMartin.\"\n\n\"It isn't strength, sir,\" replied Malachi, \"but he will slip through\nyour fingers, if not well tied in half a minute. Now, we will just walk\ndown to where I intend to meet him, and survey the place, and then I'll\nshow you where you must be, for we must not be seen together in that\ndirection to-morrow, for he may be lurking about, and have some\nsuspicion.\"\n\nThey then walked to the end of the prairie nearest to the fort, which\nwas about a mile from the house, and Malachi having selected his ground,\nand pointed out to them where to conceal themselves, they returned to\nthe house, Alfred having made arrangements when and where he and Martin\nwould meet Captain Sinclair on the day appointed.\n\nThe next day passed, and Malachi, as the sun sank behind the lake,\nwalked out to the end of the prairie. He had not been there ten minutes\nwhen the young Indian stood before him. He was armed, as before, with\nhis tomahawk and bows and arrows, but Malachi had come out expressly\nwithout his rifle.\n\nMalachi, as soon as he perceived the Indian, sat down, as is the usual\ncustom among them when they hold a talk, and the Young Otter followed\nhis example.\n\n\"Has my father talked to the white man?\" said the Indian after a short\nsilence.\n\n\"The white man grieves for the loss of his boy, and his squaw weeps,\"\nreplied Malachi. \"The Angry Snake must bring the boy to the lodge of the\nwhite man, and receive presents.\"\n\n\"Will the white man be generous?\" continued the Indian.\n\n\"He has powder, and lead, and rifles, and tobacco; will such presents\nplease the Angry Snake?\"\n\n\"The Angry Snake had a dream,\" replied the Indian, \"and he told me his\ndream. He dreamed that the white boy was put into his mother's arms, who\nwept for joy, and the white man opened his store, and gave to the Angry\nSnake ten rifles, and two kegs of powder, and as much lead as four men\ncould carry away.\"\n\n\"'Twas a good dream,\" replied Malachi, \"and it will come true when the\nwhite boy comes back to his mother.\"\n\n\"The Angry Snake had another dream. He dreamed that the white man\nreceived his child, and pushed the Angry Snake out from the door of his\nlodge.\"\n\n\"That was bad,\" replied Malachi. \"Look at me, my son; say, did you ever\nhear that the Gray Badger said a lie?\" and Malachi laid hold of the\nIndian's arm as he spoke.\n\nThis was the signal agreed upon between Malachi and the party concealed,\nwho rushed forward and seized the Indian. The Young Otter sprang up in\nspite of their endeavors to keep him, and would certainly have escaped,\nfor he had got his tomahawk clear, and was about to wield it around his\nhead, had not Martin already passed one of the deer thongs round his\nankle, by which the Indian was thrown again to the ground. His arms were\nthen secured behind his back with other deer-skin thongs, and another\npassed round his ankle and given to Alfred.\n\n\"You were right, Malachi,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"how he contrived to\ntwist himself out of our grasp I can not imagine; but he certainly would\nhave been off, probably have broken our heads before he went.\"\n\n\"I know the nature of these Indians, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"they're\nnever safe, even when tied, if the thong does not cut into the bone; but\nyou have him now, sir, fast enough, and the sooner you get to the fort\nthe better. You have your rifles, in the bush?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Martin, \"you'll find them behind the large oak tree.\"\n\n\"I'll fetch them; not that I think there's much danger of a rescue.\"\n\n\"We have not far to take him,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"for, as I wished\nyou and Alfred not to be so long away as to induce questions to be\nasked, I have a file of men and a corporal about half a mile off,\nconcealed in the bush. But Malachi, it is as well to let the Indian know\nthat he is only detained as a hostage, and will be restored as soon as\nthe boy is sent back.\"\n\nMalachi addressed the Indian in his own tongue, and told him what\nCaptain Sinclair requested.\n\n\"Tell him that there are several Indian women about the fort, who will\ntake any message he may send to the Angry Snake.\"\n\nThe Young Otter made no reply to any thing said by Malachi, but looked\naround him very impatiently.\n\n\"Be off as fast as you can,\" said Malachi, \"for depend upon it the Angry\nSnake was to meet him after his talk with me; I see it by his wandering\neye, and his looking round for assistance. I will go with you, and\nreturn with Alfred and Martin, for I have no rifle.\"\n\n\"You can take mine, Malachi, as soon as we come up to the soldiers.\"\n\nThis was done in a few minutes. Captain Sinclair then took charge of the\nIndian, and set off with his party for the fort. Malachi, Alfred, and\nMartin returned to the house, and before they entered the prairie,\nMartin detected the tall form of an Indian at a short distance, in the\nshade of the trees.\n\n\"Yes, I was sure of it,\" said Malachi. \"It was well that I did not go\nback without you. After all, in the woods, a man's no man without his\nrifle.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\nMartin was right when he stated that he perceived the form of the Angry\nSnake under the shade of the trees. The chief was then watching what\noccurred, and had been witness to the capture of his emissary, and,\nfollowing those who had the Young Otter in charge, saw him conveyed to\nthe fort. In the meantime, Malachi, Martin, and Alfred went home,\nwithout any suspicion being raised among the other branches of the\nfamily of what had occurred. This gave them great satisfaction.\n\n\"Well, Malachi,\" said Alfred the next morning, as they were all busily\nemployed getting the seed into the new cleared land; \"what do you\nimagine will be the steps now taken by the Angry Snake?\"\n\n\"It's hard to say, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"for he well deserves the name\nof a snake, if, as the Scripture says, it's the subtlest thing on earth:\nhe will try all he can, you may be sure; and if it were not that he is\nafraid of us, he would attack us immediately; but that I have no idea\nthat he will venture upon.\"\n\n\"No, for your letter says, that he has only two rifles in his band,\nwhich are not enough to give him any chance of success.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir. I hear that the _bateaux_ are coming from the fort for\nthe plank and flour.\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow, if there is not so much wind as there is to-day; it\nblows very fresh. Where is John?\"\n\n\"I left him with the Strawberry, sir; they were busy with the sugar.\"\n\n\"By the by, how much have you got, Malachi?\"\n\n\"About three or four hundred pounds, sir, as near as I can reckon; quite\nas much as madam will require.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think so; now we shall have preserves of all sorts and\nthe fruit for nothing; the wild raspberries are nearly ripe, and so are\nthe cherries; my cousins want John to help to gather them.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I dare say he will do so, although I believe that he would\nrather do any thing else. He said he was going to fish this morning.\"\n\n\"The water is too rough, and he will not be able to manage the punt by\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Then that's the very reason why he'll go out,\" replied Malachi; \"he\ndon't like easy jobs like picking raspberries. Is it true, Mr. Alfred,\nthat we are to have some more settlers come here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe so; my father is very anxious to have them; he thinks it\nwill be a great security, and he has offered very advantageous terms;\nyou won't much like that, Malachi?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I dare say you may think so, but it is not the case; if any\none had told me, two years ago, that I could have remained here, I would\nhave said it was impossible, but we are all creatures of habit. I had\nbeen so used to my own company for so long a time, that when I first saw\nyou I couldn't bear the sight of you; no, not even that of your pretty\ncousins, Miss Mary and Emma, although, Heaven knows, they might tame a\nsavage; but now, sir, I feel quite changed; I have first borne with\ncompany, because I fancied the boy, and then I felt no dislike to it,\nand now I like it. I believe that in my old age I am coming back to my\nfeelings as a boy, and I think very often of my father's farm, and the\nlittle village that was close to it; and then I often fancy that I\nshould like to see a village rise up here, and a church stand up there\nupon the mount; I think I should like to live on till I saw a church\nbuilt and God worshiped as He ought to be.\"\n\n\"This is indeed a change, Malachi; well, I hope you will see a church on\nthe mount, and live many years afterward to be present at the weddings\nand christenings.\"\n\n\"As it pleases God, sir. There's one thing, Mr. Alfred, that has given\nme great content, and more than any thing, perhaps, reconciled me to my\nnew way of living; and that is, that the Strawberry, by the blessing of\nGod and the labor of your mother and cousins, has become a good\nChristian; you don't know how pleased I am at that.\"\n\n\"She's an excellent little creature, Malachi; every one is fond of her,\nand I believe Martin is very strongly attached to her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, she's a good wife, for she never uses her tongue, and obeys\nher husband in all things. I think Martin has now become quite steady,\nand you might send him to Montreal, or any where else, without fear of\nhis getting into the prison for making a disturbance.--I see that a bear\nhas been over into the maize-field last night.\"\n\n\"What! did he climb the snake-fence?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, they climb any thing; but I have got his tracks, and this\nnight I think that I shall get hold of him, for I shall lay a trap for\nhim.\"\n\nMalachi and Alfred continued to work for two or three hours, when they\nwere summoned by Emma to go in to dinner. \"I can not find John,\" said\nEmma, as they walked home; \"Strawberry says that he left her some time\nback, and went to fish; have you seen him pass by the river's side?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Alfred; \"but, Malachi, you said that he was going to fish\nin the punt, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you see the punt on the beach, Emma?\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" replied Emma; \"but it may be behind the point.\"\n\n\"Nor can I; I hope he has not been carried away by the wind, for it\nblows very hard; I'll run down, and see if he is there.\"\n\nAlfred ran down to the beach; the punt was gone from the shore, and\nafter looking for some time to leeward, which was to the eastward, in\nthe direction of the rapids, Alfred thought that he perceived something\nlike a boat at a distance of three or four miles; but the water of the\nlake was much ruffled by the strong wind, and it was not easy to\ndistinguish.\n\nAlfred hastened back, and said to Emma, \"I really am afraid that John is\nadrift. I think I see the boat, but am not sure. Emma, go in quietly and\nbring out my telescope, which is over my bed-place. Do not let them see\nyou, or they will be asking questions, and your aunt may be alarmed.\"\n\nEmma went to the house, and soon returned with the telescope. Alfred and\nMalachi then went down to the beach, and the former distinctly made out\nthat what he had seen was the punt adrift, with John in it.\n\n\"Now, what is to be done?\" said Alfred. \"I must take a horse, and ride\noff to the fort, for if they do not see him before he passes, he may not\nbe picked up.\"\n\n\"If he once gets into the rapids, sir,\" said Malachi, \"he will be in\ngreat danger; for he may be borne down upon one of the rocks, and upset\nin a minute.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he is some way from them yet,\" replied Alfred.\n\n\"Very true, sir; but with this strong wind right down to them, and\nhelping the current, he will soon be there. There is no time to be\nlost.\"\n\n\"No; but I'll go in to dinner, and as soon as I have taken a mouthful,\njust to avoid creating any alarm, I will slip out, and ride to the fort\nas fast as I can.\"\n\n\"Just so; you will be there in good time, for he is now three miles\nabove the fort; indeed, he can not well pass it without their seeing\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, he can, now that the water is so rough,\" replied Alfred;\n\"recollect that they are soldiers in the fort, and not sailors, who are\naccustomed to look on the water. A piece of drift timber and a punt is\nmuch the same to their eyes. Come, let us in to dinner.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I'll follow you,\" replied Malachi; \"but, before I come in\nI'll catch the horse and saddle him for you. You can tell Miss Emma to\nhold her tongue about it.\"\n\nAlfred rejoined Emma, whom he cautioned, and then they went in to their\ndinner.\n\n\"Where's John?\" said Mr. Campbell; \"he promised me some lake fish for\ndinner, and has never brought them in; so you will not have such good\nfare as I expected.\"\n\n\"And where's Malachi?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"I dare say he and John are out together somewhere,\" observed Henry,\nwho, with Martin, had come in before Alfred.\n\n\"Well, he will lose his dinner,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"That's what I can not afford to do, mother,\" said Alfred; \"I am very\nhungry, and I have not more than five minutes to spare, for the seed\nmust be put in to-night.\"\n\n\"I thought Malachi was with you, Alfred,\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"So he was, father,\" replied Alfred; \"but he left me. Now, mother,\nplease to give me my dinner.\"\n\nAlfred ate fast, and then rose from the table, and went away from the\nhouse. The horse was all ready, and he mounted and rode off for the\nfort, telling Malachi that his father and mother thought John was with\nhim; and that, therefore, he had better not go in to dinner, but keep\nout of the way.\n\n\"Yes, sir, that will be best, and then they can ask no questions. Be\nquick, sir, for I am not at all easy about the boy.\"\n\nTheir plans, however, to conceal the danger of John did not succeed; for\nMrs. Campbell, after the loss of poor little Percival, had become more\nthan ever solicitous about John, and, a minute or two after Alfred had\nleft the house, she rose from the table, and went to the door, to see if\nshe could perceive Malachi and John coming in. As it happened, Alfred\nhad just set off in a gallop, and she saw him, as well as Malachi\nstanding by himself and watching Alfred's departure. The very\ncircumstance of Alfred's mysterious departure alarmed her. He had never\nsaid that he was going to the fort, and that John was not with Malachi\nwas certain. She went into the cottage, and, sinking back in her chair,\nexclaimed--\"Some accident has happened to John!\"\n\n\"Why should you say so, my dear?\" said Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" replied Mrs. Campbell, bursting into tears. \"Alfred is\nriding away to the fort. Malachi is standing by himself outside. What\ncan it be?\"\n\nMr. Campbell and all the others ran out immediately, except Mary\nPercival, who went to Mrs. Campbell. Mr. Campbell beckoned to Emma, and\nfrom her obtained the real state of the case.\n\n\"It will be better to tell her at once,\" said Mr. Campbell, who then\nwent to his wife, telling her that John was adrift, and that Alfred had\nridden to the fort to pick him up in one of the _bateaux_, but there\nwas no danger to be apprehended.\n\n\"Why should they conceal it, if there was no danger, Campbell?\" replied\nhis wife. \"Yes; there must be danger now the water is so rough. My\nchild, am I to lose you as well as my poor Percival!\" continued Mrs.\nCampbell, again sobbing.\n\nEvery attempt was made to console her and assuage her fears, but with\nindifferent success, and the afternoon of this day was passed in great\nconcern by all, and in an extreme state of nervous anxiety on the part\nof Mrs. Campbell. Toward the evening, Alfred was seen returning on\nhorseback at full speed. The whole of the family were out watching his\narrival, with beating hearts; poor Mrs. Campbell in almost a fainting\nstate. Alfred perceived them long before he had crossed the prairie, and\nwaved his hat in token of good tidings.\n\n\"All's well, depend upon it, my dear,\" said Mr. Campbell. \"Alfred would\nnot wave his hat if there was any disaster.\"\n\n\"I must have it from his own mouth,\" said Mrs. Campbell, almost\nbreathless.\n\n\"Safe?\" cried out Martin to Alfred, as he approached.\n\n\"Safe, quite safe!\" cried Alfred, in return.\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" cried Mrs. Campbell, in a low voice, clasping her hands\nin gratitude.\n\nAlfred leaped off his saddle, and hastened to communicate the news.\nJohn, trusting too much to his own powers, had gone out in the punt, and\nsoon found out that he could not manage it in so strong a wind. He\nattempted to get back to the beach, but was unsuccessful, and had, as we\nhave said, been carried away by the wind and current down toward the\nrapids; but it so happened, that before Alfred had arrived at the fort,\nCaptain Sinclair had observed the punt adrift, and, by the aid of a\ntelescope, ascertained that John was in it, exerting himself very\nvigorously, but to no purpose. Captain Sinclair, having reported to the\ncommandant and obtained permission, had launched one of the _bateaux_,\nmanned by the soldiers, and had brought John and the punt on shore,\nabout four miles below the fort, and not until they had arrived in the\nstrong current of the rapids, which in another hour would have, in all\nprobability, proved fatal. Alfred, from the fort, had seen Captain\nSinclair gain the shore, with John and the punt in tow, and, as soon as\nhe was satisfied of his brother's safety, had ridden back as fast as he\ncould, to communicate it. This intelligence gave them all great delight,\nand now that they knew that John was safe, they waited his return with\npatience. Captain Sinclair arrived, with John behind him, on horseback,\nabout two hours afterward, and was gladly welcomed.\n\n\"Indeed, Captain Sinclair, we are under great obligations to you. Had\nyou not been so active, the boy might have been lost,\" said Mrs.\nCampbell. \"Accept my best thanks.\"\n\n\"And mine,\" said Mary, extending her hand to him.\n\n\"John, you have frightened me very much,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"how could\nyou be so imprudent as to go on the lake in such a high wind? See, what\na narrow escape you have had.\"\n\n\"I should have been at Montreal to-morrow morning,\" said John, laughing.\n\n\"No, never; you would have been upset in the rapids long before you\ncould get to Montreal.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, I can swim,\" replied John.\n\n\"You naughty boy, nothing will make you afraid.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, it's a good fault, that of having confidence in yourself,\nso don't check it too much,\" replied Malachi. \"It saves many a man who\nwould otherwise be lost.\"\n\n\"That's very true, Malachi,\" observed Alfred; \"so, now that he is safe\nback, we won't scold John any more. He will know better than to go out\nin such rough weather again.\"\n\n\"To be sure I shall,\" said John; \"I don't _want_ to go down the rapids.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear you say that,\" replied Mrs. Campbell.\n\nCaptain Sinclair remained with them that night. Before daylight, the\nfamily were alarmed by the report of a gun, and it was immediately\nsupposed that some attack had been made on the lodge occupied by\nMalachi, Martin, and his wife. Captain Sinclair, Alfred, and John sprang\nout of bed, and were clothed in a minute. As soon as they had armed\nthemselves, they opened the door cautiously, and, looking well round,\nwent through the passage to the sheep-fold where the lodge was built.\nEvery thing, however, appeared to be quiet, and Alfred knocked at the\ndoor. Malachi answered to the inquiry, \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"We heard the report of a gun close to the house just now, and we\nthought something might have happened.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Malachi, laughing, \"is that all? Then you may all go to bed\nagain. It's my trap for the bear--nothing more. I forgot to tell you\nlast night.\"\n\n\"Well, as we are up, we may as well go and see,\" said Alfred; \"the day\nis breaking.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I am ready,\" said Malachi, coming out with his deer-skin\njacket in one hand and his rifle in the other.\n\nThey walked to the maize-field on the other side of the river, and found\nthat the trap had been successful, for a large bear lay dead at the foot\nof the snake-fence.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I've got him,\" said Malachi.\n\n\"But what was the trap?\" said Henry.\n\n\"You see, sir, I tracked the brute over the rails by his broad\nfoot-mark, and as I knew he would come the same way, I fixed the rifle\nwith a wire to the trigger, so that, as he climbed up, he must touch the\nwire with his fore-paws, and the muzzle, pointed a little downward,\nwould then about reach his heart when the gun went off. You see, sir, it\nhas happened just as I wished it, and there's another good skin for\nMontreal.\"\n\n\"It is a she-bear,\" said Martin, who had joined them, \"and she has cubs;\nthey can't be far off.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" replied Malachi; \"so now you had better all go back\nagain. Martin and I will hide, and I'll answer for it, in an hour, we\nwill bring the cubs home with us.\"\n\nThe rest of the party returned to the house. The Strawberry had already\nmade known to Mr. and Mrs. Campbell the cause of the report. About an\nhour before breakfast, Malachi and Martin came in, each with a cub of a\nfew weeks old. The little animals had come in the track of the mother in\nsearch of her, and were pawing the dead body, as if trying to awaken\nher, when Malachi and Martin secured them.\n\n\"What a charming pet,\" said Emma; \"I will rear it for myself.\"\n\n\"And I'll have the other,\" said John.\n\nNo objection was raised to this, except that Mr. Campbell observed, that\nif they became troublesome as they grew up, they must be parted with,\nwhich was agreed to. Emma and John took possession of their pets, and\nfed them with milk, and in a few days they became very tame; one being\nchained up near the house, and the other at Malachi's lodge. They soon\ngrew very playful and very amusing little animals, and the dogs became\nused to them, and never attempted to hurt them; indeed, very often Oscar\nand the bear would be seen rolling about together, the best friends in\nthe world. But in a few months they became too large for pets, and too\ntroublesome, so one was dispatched by a _bateau_ going to Montreal, as a\npresent to Mr. Emmerson, and the other was taken to the fort by Captain\nSinclair, and became a great favorite of the soldiers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\nCaptain Sinclair was now very constantly at the house, for in the summer\ntime the commandant allowed much more liberty to the officers. Although\nthe detention of the Young Otter and the cause of his being detained,\nhad been made known to the Angry Snake, weeks passed away, and yet there\nappeared no intention on the part of the chief to redeem his young\nwarrior by producing Percival. Every day an overture on his part was\nexpected, but none came, and those who were in the secret were in a\ncontinual state of suspense and anxiety. One thing had been ascertained,\nwhich was, that the Indian fired at by John had been killed, and this\noccasioned much fear on the part of Malachi and Martin, that the Angry\nSnake would revenge the death upon young Percival. This knowledge of the\nIndian feeling, however, they kept to themselves.\n\nToward the close of the summer they had an arrival of letters and\nnewspapers, both from England and Montreal. There was nothing peculiarly\ninteresting in the intelligence from England, although the newspapers\nwere, as usual, read with great avidity. One paragraph met the eye of\nHenry, which he immediately communicated, observing at the time that\nthey always obtained news of Mr. Douglas Campbell on every fresh\narrival. The paragraph was as follows:--\"The Oxley hounds had a splendid\nrun on Friday last;\" after describing the country they passed through,\nthe paragraph ended with, \"We regret to say that Mr. Douglas Campbell,\nof Wexton Hall, received a heavy fall from his horse, in clearing a wide\nbrook. He is, however, we understand, doing well.\" The letters from\nMontreal, were, however, important. They communicated the immediate\ndeparture from that city of four families of emigrants, who had accepted\nthe terms offered by Mr. Emmerson, and were coming to settle upon Mr.\nCampbell's property. They also stated that the purchase of the other six\nhundred acres of contiguous land had been completed, and sent government\nreceipts for the purchase-money.\n\nThe news contained in this letter induced Mr. Campbell to send a message\nto the commandant of the fort, by Captain Sinclair, acquainting him with\nthe expected arrival of the emigrant families, and requesting to know\nwhether he would allow a party of soldiers to assist in raising the\ncottages necessary for their reception, and begging the loan of two or\nthree tents to accommodate them upon their arrival, until their cottages\nshould be built. The reply of the commandant was favorable, and now all\nwas bustle and activity, that, if possible, the buildings might be in\nforwardness previous to harvest time, when they would all have ample\noccupation. Indeed, as the hay harvest was just coming on, without\nassistance from the fort they never could have got through the work\nprevious to the winter setting in, and it would have been very\ninconvenient to have had to receive any of the emigrants into their own\nhouse.\n\nThe sites of the four cottages, or log huts, were soon selected; they\nwere each of them nearly half a mile from Mr. Campbell's house, and\nwhile some of the party, assisted by a portion of the soldiers, were\ngetting in the hay, the others, with another portion, were cutting down\nthe trees, and building up the cottages. In a fortnight after they had\ncommenced, the emigrants arrived, and were housed in the tents prepared\nfor them; and as their labor was now added to that of the others, in a\nshort time every thing was well in advance. The agreement made by Mr.\nCampbell was, that the emigrants should each receive fifty acres of\nland, after they had cleared for him a similar quantity; but there were\nmany other conditions, relative to food and supply of stock to the\nemigrant families, which are not worth the while to dwell upon. It is\nsufficient to say that Mr. Campbell, with his former purchases, retained\nabout 600 acres, which he considered quite sufficient for his farm,\nwhich was all in a ring fence, and with the advantage of bordering on\nthe lake. The fire had cleared a great deal of the new land, so that it\nrequired little trouble for his own people to get it into a fit state\nfor the first crop.\n\nWhile the emigrants and soldiers were hard at work, the Colonel paid a\nvisit to Mr. Campbell to settle his account with him, and handed over a\nbill upon government for the planks, flour, etc., supplied to the fort.\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Campbell, I have great pleasure,\" said the Colonel,\n\"in giving you every assistance, and I render it the more readily as I\nam authorized by the Governor so to do. Your arrival and settling here\nhas proved very advantageous; for your supplying the fort has saved the\ngovernment a great deal of money, at the same time that it has been\nprofitable to you, and enabled you to get rid of your crops without\nsending them down so far as Montreal; which would have been as serious\nan expense to you, as getting the provisions from Montreal has proved to\nus. You may keep the fatigue party of soldiers upon the same terms as\nbefore, as long as they may prove useful to you, provided they return\nto the fort by the coming of winter.\"\n\n\"Then I will, if you please, retain them for getting in the harvest; we\nhave so much to do that I shall be most happy to pay for their\nassistance.\"\n\nI have said that there were four families of emigrants, and now I will\nlet my readers know a little more about them.\n\nThe first family was a man and his wife of the name of Harvey; they had\ntwo sons of fourteen and fifteen, and a daughter of eighteen years of\nage. This man had been a small farmer, and by his industry was gaining\nan honest livelihood, and putting by some money, when his eldest son,\nwho was at the time about twenty years old, fell into bad company, and\nwas always to be seen at the alehouses or at the fairs, losing his time\nand losing his money. The father, whose ancestors had resided for many\ngenerations on the same spot, and had always been, as long as they could\ntrace back, small farmers like himself, and who was proud of only one\nthing, which was that his family had been noted for honesty and upright\ndealing, did all he could to reclaim him, but in vain. At last the son\nwas guilty of a burglary, tried, convicted, and transported for life.\nThe disgrace had such an effect upon the father, that he never held up\nhis head afterward; he was ashamed to be seen in the parish, and at last\nhe resolved to emigrate to a new country where what had happened would\nnot be known.\n\nHe accordingly sold off every thing, and came to Canada; but by the time\nthat he had arrived in the country, and paid all his expenses, he had\nlittle money left, and when he heard from Mr. Emmerson the terms offered\nby Mr. Campbell, he gladly accepted them. The wife, his two sons and his\ndaughter, who came with him, were as industrious and as respectable as\nhimself.\n\nThe second family, of the name of Graves, consisted of a man and his\nwife, and only one son, a young man grown up; but the wife's two sisters\nwere with them. He had come from Buckinghamshire, and had been\naccustomed to a dairy farm.\n\nThe third family was a very numerous one, with a man and his wife, of\nthe name of Jackson; these had been farmers and market-gardeners near\nLondon; and had brought out some money with them: but, as I have\nmentioned, they had a very large family, most of them too young to be\nvery useful for a few years. They had seven children: a girl of\neighteen, two boys of twelve and thirteen, then three little girls, and\na boy an infant. Jackson had money enough to purchase a farm, but being\na very prudent man, and reflecting that he might not succeed at first,\nand that his large family would run away with all his means, he decided\nupon accepting the terms proposed by Mr. Campbell.\n\nThe fourth and last of the emigrant families was a young couple of the\nname of Meredith. The husband was the son of a farmer in Shropshire, who\nhad died, and divided his property between his three sons: two of them\nremained upon the farm and paid the youngest brother his proportion in\nmoney, who, being of a speculative turn, resolved to come to Canada, and\ntry his fortune. He married just before he came out, and was not as yet\nencumbered with any family; he was a fine young man, well educated, and\nhis wife a very clever, pretty young woman.\n\nThus there was an addition of twenty-one souls to the population of Mr.\nCampbell's settlement, which with their own ten made a total of\nthirty-one people, out of whom they reckoned that thirteen were capable\nof bearing arms, and defending them from any attack of the Indians.\n\nBefore harvest time, the cottages were all built, and the emigrants were\nbusy felling round their new habitations, to lay up fire-wood for the\nwinter, and clearing away a spot for a garden, and for planting potatoes\nin the following spring. The harvest being ripe again, gave them all\nfull employment; the corn was got in with great expedition by the united\nlabor of the soldiers and emigrants, when the former, having completed\ntheir work, returned to the fort, and the Campbells, with the addition\nto their colony, were now left alone. Visiting the emigrants in their\nown cottages, and making acquaintance with the children, was now a great\nsource of amusement to the Miss Percivals. Various plans were started\nrelative to establishing a Sunday-school and many other useful\narrangements; one, however, took place immediately, which was, that\ndivine service was performed by Mr. Campbell in his own house, and was\nattended by all the emigrants every Sunday. Mr. Campbell had every\nreason to be pleased with their conduct up to the present time; they all\nappeared willing, never murmured or complained at any task allotted to\nthem, and were satisfied with Mr. Campbell's arrangements relative to\nsupplies. Parties were now again formed for the chase; Meredith and\nyoung Graves proved to be good woodsmen and capital shots with the\nrifle, so that now they had enough to send out a party on alternate\ndays, while one or two of the others fished all the day and salted down\nas fast as they caught, that there might be a full supply for the\nwinter.\n\nBut although Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and the Miss Percivals, as well as\nthe major part of the family, were fully satisfied and happy in their\nfuture prospects, there were four who were in a state of great anxiety\nand suspense. These were Alfred, Malachi, Martin, and the Strawberry,\nwho, being acquainted with the existence of young Percival, found their\nsecret a source of great annoyance, now that, notwithstanding the\ncapture and detention of the Young Otter, no advance appeared to be made\nfor his exchange, nor any signs of any overture on the part of the Angry\nSnake. Captain Sinclair, who was usually at the farm twice during the\nweek, was also much fretted at finding that every time Malachi and\nAlfred had no more information to give him than he had to impart to\nthem. They hardly knew how to act; to let a second winter pass away\nwithout attempting to recover the boy, appeared to them to be delaying\ntoo long, and yet to communicate intelligence which might only end in\nbitter disappointment, seemed unadvisable; for the Indian chief, out of\nrevenge, might have killed the boy, and then the grief of the father and\nmother would be more intense than before. It would be opening a wound to\nno purpose. This question was frequently canvassed by Alfred and Captain\nSinclair, but an end was put to all their debates on the subject by an\nunexpected occurrence. Mary Percival had one morning gone down to a\nplace called the Cedar Swamp, about half a mile from the house to the\nwestward, near to the shore of the lake, to pick cranberries for\npreserving. One of the little emigrant girls, Martha Jackson, was with\nher; when one basket was full, Mary sent it home by the little girl,\nwith directions to come back immediately. The girl did so, but on her\nreturn to the Cedar Swamp, Mary Percival was not to be seen. The basket\nwhich she had retained with her was lying with all the cranberries upset\nout of it on a hill by the side of the swamp. The little girl remained\nfor a quarter of an hour, calling out Miss Percival's name, but not\nreceiving any answer, she became frightened, imagining that some wild\nbeast had attacked her; and she ran back as fast as she could to the\nhouse, acquainting Mr. and Mrs. Campbell with what had happened. Martin\nand Alfred were at the mill; Malachi, fortunately, was at his own lodge,\nand Strawberry ran for him, told him what the girl had reported, and\nhaving done so, she looked at Malachi, and said \"Angry Snake.\"\n\n\"Yes, Strawberry, that is the case, I have no doubt,\" replied Malachi;\n\"but not a word at present; I knew he would be at something, but I did\nnot think that he dared do that either; however, we shall see. Go back\nto the house, and tell master and misses that I have gone down to the\nCedar Swamp, and will return as soon as possible, and do you follow me\nas fast as you can, for your eyes are younger than mine, and I shall\nwant the use of them: tell them not to send any body else, it will do\nharm instead of good, for they will trample the ground, and we may lose\nthe track.\"\n\nMalachi caught up his rifle, examined the priming, and set off in the\ndirection of the swamp, while the Strawberry returned to the house to\ngive his message to Mr. and Mrs. Campbell. Leaving Mr. and Mrs.\nCampbell, who were in a great state of alarm, and had sent the little\ngirl, Martha Jackson, to summon Alfred and Martin (for John and Henry\nwere out in the woods after the cattle), the Strawberry went down to the\nCedar Swamp to join Malachi, whom she found standing still, leaning on\nhis rifle, near the basket which had contained the cranberries.\n\n\"Now, Strawberry, we must find out how many of them there were, and\nwhich way they have gone,\" said Malachi, in the Indian tongue.\n\n\"Here,\" said Strawberry, pointing to a mark on the short grass, which\nnever could have attracted the observation of one unused to an Indian\nlife.\n\n\"I see, child; I see that and two more, but we can not tell much as yet;\nlet us follow up the trail till we come to some spot where we may read\nthe print better. That's her foot,\" continued Malachi, after they had\nproceeded two or three yards. \"The sole of a shoe cuts the grass sharper\nthan a moccasin. We have no easy task just now, and if the others come,\nthey may prevent us from finding the track altogether.\"\n\n\"Here, again,\" said Strawberry, stooping close to the short, dry grass.\n\n\"Yes; you're right, child,\" replied Malachi. \"Let us once follow it to\nthe bottom of this hill, and then we shall do better.\"\n\nBy the closest inspection and minutest search, Malachi and the\nStrawberry continued to follow the almost imperceptible track till they\narrived at the bottom of the hill, about a hundred yards from where they\nstarted. It had become more difficult, as the print of Mary's foot,\nwhich was more easily perceptible than the others, had served them for a\nfew yards; after which it was no more to be distinguished, and it was\nevident that she had been lifted up from the ground. This satisfied them\nthat she had been carried off. When they arrived at the bottom of the\nhill, they could clearly distinguish the print marks of moccasins, and\nby measuring very exactly the breadth and length of the impressions,\nmade out that they were of two different people. These they continued to\nfollow till they arrived at the forest, about a quarter of a mile from\nthe swamp, where they heard the hallooing of Alfred and Martin, to which\nMalachi answered, and they soon joined him.\n\n\"What is it, Malachi?\"\n\n\"She has been carried off, sir, I've no doubt,\" replied Malachi, \"by\nthe Snake. The rascal is determined to have the vantage of us. We have\none prisoner, and he has made two.\"\n\nMalachi then explained why he was certain that she had been carried\naway, and Martin agreed with him immediately. Alfred then said--\"Well,\nbut now, before we act, let us consult what is best to be done.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Malachi, \"the best to do now, at this moment, is\nfor the Strawberry and me to follow the trail, and try if we can not\nobtain more information, and when we have got all we can, we must form a\nparty, and go in pursuit. Let us only get fairly on the trail, and we\nwill not lose it, especially if the Strawberry is with us, for she has a\nbetter eye than any Indian I ever knew, be it man or woman.\"\n\n\"Well, that is all right, Malachi; but what shall I do now while you are\nfollowing up the trail?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you must prepare the party, and get them all ready for a\nstart; for we must be off in three hours, if possible.\"\n\n\"Captain Sinclair had better come with us. He will be quite frantic if\nhe does not,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Well, then, perhaps he had, sir,\" replied Malachi, coldly; \"but I'd\nrather he were away. He won't be so cool and calm as he ought to be.\"\n\n\"Never fear; but I must now go to my father and mother, and tell the\nwhole of the circumstances which have occurred. I must tell them that\nPercival is alive.\"\n\n\"Why so, sir?\" replied Malachi. \"It will only fret them more. It's quite\nsufficient that they should have to lament Miss Percival being carried\noff, without their knowing what fresh cause for anxiety there is about\nthe boy. I would only say that Miss Mary has been carried off by\nsomebody, and leave out all about our having captured the Young Otter,\nand why we took him.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it will be better,\" said Alfred; \"then I'll leave Martin\nhere, and ride off to the fort to Captain Sinclair. Shall I ask for any\nsoldiers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; if there are any good backwoodsmen among them, we may find a\ncouple of them of service. We ought to have a larger force than the\nIndian; and the latter, if you recollect, is stated at six with the\nchief. Now, there are you, Martin, and I, that's three; Captain Sinclair\nand two soldiers would be six; young Graves and Meredith make eight.\nThat's sufficient, sir; more than sufficient does harm. Mr. Henry must\nstay, and so must Mr. John, because he will not be home before we are\naway. I'm sorry for that, as I should have liked him to be with me.\"\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" replied Alfred. \"Well then, Martin and I will go\nback at once; in two hours I will return with Captain Sinclair, if I\npossibly can.\"\n\n\"As quick as you please, sir, and Martin will get every thing ready for\nthe journey, for we must not fire our rifles, if we can help it.\"\n\nAlfred hastened away, and was soon followed by Martin, to whom Malachi\nhad given some directions. Malachi and the Strawberry then continued to\nfollow the trail, which they traced through the thickest of the wood for\nmore than an hour, when they came upon a spot where a fire had been\nlighted, and the ground trodden down, evidently showing that the parties\nhad been living there some time.\n\n\"Here was the nest of the whole gang,\" resumed Malachi, as he looked\nround.\n\nThe Strawberry, who had been examining the ground, said--\n\n\"Here is her foot again.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; it's clear enough that two of them have carried her off and\nbrought her here to where the others were waiting for them, and from\nhere the whole party have made their start. Now we have the new trail to\nfind, and that they have taken every care to prevent us, I do not\ndoubt.\"\n\nThe Strawberry now pointed to a mark near where the fire had been\nlighted, and said, \"The moccasin of a squaw.\"\n\n\"Right, then she is with them, so much the better,\" replied Malachi,\n\"for, as she sent me that letter, she may serve us still, if she\nchooses.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\nPrevious to his starting for the fort, Alfred had a hasty communication\nwith his father and mother, in which he informed them simply that it was\nevident that Mary had been carried off, and that it was the opinion of\nMalachi and Martin, that the Angry Snake was the party to be suspected.\n\n\"But what cause could he have?\" said Emma, weeping.\n\n\"Merely to get powder and shot as a reward for bringing her back again,\"\nreplied Alfred; \"so there is not any thing to fear as to her being\nill-treated; but if he has any other reason for what he has done, it is\nwell known that an Indian always respects a female. But here comes my\nhorse.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do, Alfred?\" said Mrs. Campbell, who was in a\nstate of great agitation.\n\n\"Ride to the fort for assistance, bring Captain Sinclair, and go in\npursuit as fast as we can, mother. Martin will get all ready by my\nreturn, Malachi is following up the trail with Strawberry. But there is\nno time to be lost; I shall soon be back.\"\n\nAlfred then sprang upon his horse, which Martin had brought to the door,\nand galloped away to the fort.\n\nAs it may be supposed, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Emma were in great\ndistress; this did not, however, prevent them from listening to Martin,\nand supplying him with all that he requested, which was salt pork and\nother food for their journey, powder and shot for their rifles, etc.\nHaving specified all that was wanted, Martin then went off to summon\nyoung Graves and Meredith; they were soon found, and when they heard the\nintelligence, were ready in a minute for departure. Their rifles and an\nextra pair of moccasins each was all that they required for the journey,\nand in a few minutes they accompanied Martin to the house. After they\nhad been occupied for a little time in dividing the various articles\ninto different packages, that each might carry his proportion, Mr.\nCampbell said--\n\n\"Martin, supposing that you and Malachi are correct in your supposition,\nwhere do you think that they will take my poor niece?\"\n\n\"Right away to their own wigwams, sir,\" replied Martin.\n\n\"Have you any idea how far that may be?\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I have heard that the Angry Snake's quarters are about\ntwelve days' journey from this.\"\n\n\"Twelve days' journey! how far is a journey?\"\n\n\"As far as a stout man can walk in a day, ma'am.\"\n\n\"And will my niece have to walk all the way?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, ma'am; I don't see how it can be otherwise; I don't know of\nthe Indians having any horses, although they may have.\"\n\n\"But she can not walk as far as a man,\" replied Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"No, ma'am, and so I suppose they will be twenty days going instead of\ntwelve.\"\n\n\"Will they ill-treat or ill-use her, Martin?\" said Emma.\n\n\"No, ma'am, I shouldn't think they would, although they will make her\nwalk, and will tie her at night when they stop.\"\n\n\"Poor Mary: what will she suffer?\" exclaimed Emma; \"and if you do come\nup with them, Martin, will they give her up to you?\"\n\n\"We shan't ask their leave, miss,\" replied Martin; \"we shall take her.\"\n\n\"But not without bloodshed, Martin,\" said Mrs. Campbell.\n\n\"No, ma'am, certainly not without bloodshed, for either the Indians must\ndestroy us or we them; if we conquer, not an Indian will be left alive;\nand if they master us, it will be about the same thing, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Heaven protect us, but this is dreadful; I was prepared for\ndifficulties and annoyances when I came out here,\" exclaimed Mrs.\nCampbell; \"but not for such trials as these.\"\n\n\"Never fear but we'll bring her back, ma'am,\" said Martin; \"Malachi is a\nbetter Indian than them all, and he'll circumvent them.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, ma'am, that we will, if possible, fall upon them unawares, and\nthen we'll have the advantage, for half of them will be killed before\nthey know that they are attacked; we'll fight them Indian fashion,\nma'am.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell continued her interrogations till Alfred was seen at the\nend of the prairie returning at full speed, accompanied by Captain\nSinclair and two other men, also on horseback.\n\n\"Here they come,\" said Martin; \"and they have lost no time, that's\ncertain.\"\n\n\"Poor Captain Sinclair? what must be his feelings! I pity him,\" said\nMrs. Campbell.\n\n\"He must take it coolly, nevertheless,\" observed Martin; \"or he may do\nmore harm than good.\"\n\nAlfred and Captain Sinclair now dismounted: they had brought with them\ntwo of the soldiers who were well used to the woods, and excellent shots\nwith the rifle. A hurried conversation of a few minutes took place, but\ntime was too precious, and Alfred, embracing his father and mother, who,\nas they shook hands with Captain Sinclair, expressed in a melancholy way\ntheir hopes for their success, the party of seven which had been\ncollected set off to rejoin Malachi and the Strawberry.\n\nMalachi and Strawberry had not been idle; the latter had run back to\ntheir lodge and procured a bow and arrows, and since that they had\ntracked the footmarks through the forest for more than a mile, when they\nhad come to a small rivulet which ran through the forest. Here the trail\nwas lost, at least it was not to be perceived any where on the opposite\nside of the rivulet, and it was to be presumed that, to conceal their\ntrail, the Indians had walked in the water, either up or down, for a\ncertain distance before they put their feet on the other side; but as it\nwas near the time that they might expect the arrival of Alfred and the\nothers, Malachi had returned to the spot where Alfred and Martin had\nleft them, leaving the Strawberry to walk down and up the side of the\nrivulet to recover the trail. As soon as the party joined him, they and\nMalachi set off to where the trail had been lost, and the latter had\nleft the Strawberry.\n\nThere they waited some time, as the Strawberry was not in sight, and\nthey took this opportunity of distributing the provisions and ammunition\namong them. Captain Sinclair, although his feelings may well be\nimagined, was very active in arrangements, and showed that, if his heart\nwas smitten, his head was clear. The order of the march was settled by\nMalachi and him, and as soon as all was arranged, they waited\nimpatiently for the return of the Indian girl; she came at last, and\ninformed them that she had recovered the trail about three miles up the\ncourse of the stream, and they all started immediately. As was agreed,\nthey kept perfect silence, and followed the newly-discovered trail for\nabout a mile, when, on their arrival at a clear spot in the woods, where\nthe grass was very short and dry, they were again at fault. They went\nover to the other side of this heath, to see if they could again fall in\nwith it, but after half-an-hour's search, could not discover it, when\nthey were summoned by a low whistle from the Strawberry, who had\nreturned to the spot where the trail had been lost.\n\n\"They have turned back again,\" said the Strawberry, pointing to the\nformer footmarks; \"see, the track of the moccasins is both ways.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Malachi, after a close examination; \"now then,\nStrawberry, to find out where they have left the old trail again. I told\nyou, sir,\" continued Malachi to Alfred, \"that the Strawberry would be\nuseful; she has the eye of a falcon.\"\n\nIt was not till another half-hour had elapsed that the spot where they\nhad left the trail, which, to deceive those who might pursue them, the\nIndians had returned upon, was discovered, and then they started again,\nand proceeded with caution, led by the Strawberry, until she stopped and\nspoke to Malachi in the Indian tongue, pointing at a small twig broken\nupon one of the bushes.\n\n\"That's true, let us see if it happens again.\"\n\nIn a few moments the Strawberry pointed out another.\n\n\"Then all's right,\" said Malachi, \"I said that she could help us again\nif she chose, and so she has. The Indian woman who wrote the letter,\"\ncontinued Malachi, turning to Captain Sinclair and Alfred, \"is our\nfriend still. See, sir, she has, wherever she has dared to do it without\nbeing seen by the Indians, broken down a small twig as a guide to us.\nNow, if she has continued to do this, we shall not have much trouble.\"\n\nThey continued their course through the woods until the sun went down,\nand they could see no longer, having made a journey of about nine miles\nfrom the settlement. They then lay down for the night under a large\ntree; the weather was very warm, and they did not light a fire, as they\nhad some cooked provisions.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as it was daylight, they made a hasty meal,\nand resumed their task. The trail was now pretty clear, and was\noccasionally verified by the breaking of a twig, as before. This day\nthey made sixteen miles' journey, and at the close of it they arrived at\nthe borders of a lake about ten miles long, and from one-and-a-half to\ntwo wide; the trail went right on to the shore of the lake, and then\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Here they must have taken to the water,\" said Alfred; \"but what means\nhave they had to cross?\"\n\n\"That we must discover, somehow or another, sir,\" replied Malachi, \"or\nelse we shall not find the trail again; perhaps, however, we shall see\nto-morrow morning; it is too dark now to attempt to find out, and we may\ndo more harm than good by tracking down the bank. We must bring to for\nthe night. There is a high rock there on the beach further up, we had\nbetter go there, as we can light a fire behind the rock without being\ndiscovered by it, supposing the Indians are on the opposite shore; and\nto-night we must cook all our provisions if we possibly can, for, depend\nupon it, we have traveled faster to-day than they can have done with the\nyoung lady, and if we can once get well on the trail again, we shall\nsoon be up with them.\"\n\n\"God grant that we may!\" exclaimed Captain Sinclair; \"the idea of what\npoor Mary must suffer, almost drives me mad.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, she will be terribly foot-sore, I have no doubt,\" replied\nMalachi, \"but the Indians will not treat her ill, depend upon it.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair sighed, but made no reply.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the mass of rock which Malachi had pointed\nout, they all commenced collecting fire-wood, and the Strawberry in a\nfew minutes had a sufficient fire for their purpose. They had not any\ncooking utensils with them, but the pork was cut in slices, and stuck\nupon the ends of small sticks round the fire, until it was sufficiently\ncooked, and then it was packed up again in parcels, with the exception\nof what was retained for their supper. They had finished their meal, and\nwere sitting round the embers of the fire, conversing, and calculating\nthe probabilities as to their overtaking the Indians, when Martin sprang\nup, with his rifle ready to bring to his shoulder.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Alfred in a low tone, as Martin held up his finger as\na sign for silence.\n\n\"There's somebody coming this way--he is behind that large tree,\" said\nMartin; \"I see his head now, but it is too dark to make out who it may\nbe.\"\n\nAs Martin said this, a low and singular sort of whistle between the\nteeth was heard, upon which the Strawberry gently put down Martin's\nrifle with her hand, saying,\n\n\"It is John.\"\n\n\"John! impossible,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"It is,\" replied Strawberry. \"I know well that whistle. I go to fetch\nhim. I have no fear.\"\n\nStrawberry stepped out from the group, and went up to the tree, calling\nJohn softly by name, and in a few seconds afterward returned, leading\nJohn by the hand, who, without saying a word, quietly seated himself\ndown by the fire.\n\n\"Well, John, how did you come here?\" exclaimed Alfred.\n\n\"Followed trail,\" replied John.\n\n\"But how--when did you leave home?\"\n\n\"Yesterday,\" replied John, \"when I came back.\"\n\n\"But do your father and mother know that you come?\" said Captain\nSinclair.\n\n\"I met old Graves, and told him,\" replied John. \"Have you any meat?\"\n\n\"The boy has had nothing since he left, I'll answer for it,\" said\nMartin, as the Strawberry handed some of the pork to John, \"have you,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied John, with his mouth full.\n\n\"Let him eat,\" said Malachi, \"it's long for a lad to be two days without\nfood, for I'll answer he left as soon as he heard we were gone, and did\nnot wait for yesterday's supper. Indeed he must have done so, for he\nmust have followed the trail some time yesterday to be up with us\nto-night, so let him eat in quiet.\"\n\n\"What surprises me, Malachi, is how he could have found his way to us.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I do confess that I'm as much surprised almost as I am\npleased,\" replied Malachi. \"It is really a great feat for a lad to\naccomplish all by himself, and I am proud of him for having done it; but\nfrom the first I saw what a capital woodsman he would make, and he has\nnot disappointed me.\"\n\n\"There are not many who would have been able to do it, that's certain,\"\nsaid Martin; \"I wonder as much as you do, Mr. Alfred, how he could have\ndone it--but he has the gift.\"\n\n\"But suppose he had not come up with us, how would he have lived in\nthese woods? It's a mercy that he has fallen in with us,\" said Captain\nSinclair.\n\nJohn slapped the barrel of his rifle, which was lying by him, and which\nCaptain Sinclair had not perceived.\n\n\"You don't think that John would come into the woods without his rifle,\nsir, do you?\" said Malachi.\n\n\"I did not perceive that he had it with him,\" said Captain Sinclair,\n\"but I certainly ought to have known John better.\"\n\nJohn having finished his supper, they all lay down to rest, one keeping\nwatch that they might not be surprised.\n\nAt daylight they made their breakfast, and then went down again to the\nborders of the lake, where the trail had been lost. After a long\nexamination, Malachi called the Strawberry, and pointing to the edge of\nthe water, asked her to look there. The Strawberry did so, and at last\ndecided that there was the mark of the bottom of a canoe which had been\ngrounded.\n\n\"Yes, I thought so,\" said Malachi. \"They have had their canoe all ready,\nand have crossed the water; now, we must walk quite round the lake to\ndiscover the trail again, and that will give them half a day's start of\nus.\"\n\nThey immediately set off coasting the shore of the lake, until they\narrived at the other side, carefully examining the ground as they went.\nThis took them till noon, by which time they had arrived at that part of\nthe lake which was opposite to the large rock behind which they had\nkindled their fire the night before; but no traces were to be perceived.\n\n\"They have not crossed over in a straight line,\" said Captain Sinclair,\n\"that is evident; we must now try more to the northward.\"\n\nThis they did; and at last discovered that the canoe had crossed over to\nthe north point of the lake, having coasted along the eastern shore the\nwhole way. The spot of landing was very evident, and for some distance\nthey could trace where the canoe had been hauled up. It was now late in\nthe afternoon, and it became a question whether they should follow the\ntrail, or discover the place of concealment of the canoe, as it might be\nadvantageous to know where it was when they returned. It was decided\nthat they should first discover the canoe, and this was not done till\nafter a search of two hours, when they found it concealed in the bushes,\nabout one mile from the lake. They then followed the trail about two\nmiles; the twigs had been bent and broken, as before, which was a great\nhelp to them, but the night was now closing in. Having arrived at a\nclear knoll, they took up their quarters under the trees, and retired to\nrest. At daybreak they again started; and, after two hours' walk, had to\ntrack across a small prairie, which gave them some trouble, but they\nsucceeded in finding the trail on their arrival at the wood on the\nopposite side, and then they made a very rapid progress, for the twigs\nwere now more frequently broken and bent than before. During this day,\nwith the bow and arrows brought by the Strawberry, Martin had procured\nthem two wild turkeys, which were very acceptable, as their provisions\nwould not last more than seven or eight days longer, and it was\nimpossible to say how far they would have to travel. It was not far from\ndark when the quick ears of the Strawberry were attracted by a noise\nlike that of a person breathing heavily. She at last pointed with her\nfinger to a bush; they advanced cautiously, and on the other side of it\nthey found an Indian woman lying on the ground, bleeding profusely. They\nraised her up, and discovered that it was the Indian whom they had cured\nof the sprained ankle, and who, they presumed, had been then discovered\nbreaking the twigs that they might follow the trail, for, on examination\nthey found that she had received a heavy blow on the head with a\ntomahawk; but, fortunately, it had glanced sidewise, and not entered\ninto the brain. She was not sensible, however, at the time that they\ndiscovered her, for she had lost a great deal of blood. They stopped the\neffusion of blood with bandages torn from their linen, and poured some\nwater down her throat; it was now dark, and it was not possible to\nproceed any further that night. The Strawberry went into the woods and\ncollected some herbs, with which she dressed the wound, and having made\nthe poor Indian as comfortable as they could, they again lay down to\nrest; but not until Malachi had said to Alfred--\n\n\"There is no doubt, sir, but that the Indians have discovered this woman\nwas marking the trail for us, and that they have tomahawked her for so\ndoing, and have left her for dead. I think myself that the wound,\nalthough it is a very ugly one, is not dangerous, and so says the\nStrawberry. However, to-morrow will decide the point; if she is not\nsensible then, it will be of no use waiting, but we must go on as fast\nas we can.\"\n\nWhen they awoke the next morning they found the Strawberry sitting by\nthe Indian woman, who was now quite sensible and collected, although\nvery weak and exhausted. Malachi and Martin went to her, and had a long\nconversation with her at intervals. Malachi had been right in his\nsupposition; the Angry Snake had discovered her in the act of bending a\ntwig, and had struck her down with his tomahawk. They gained from her\nthe following information. The Angry Snake, irritated at the detention\nof the Young Otter, and resolved to have another hostage in lieu of him,\nhad carried off Mary Percival. He had six Indians with him, which were\nthe whole of his grown-up warriors. They were now but one day's journey\nahead of them, as Miss Percival was very sore on her feet, and they\ncould not get her along, but that in every other respect she had been\nwell treated. That the Indians were not going to their lodges in a\ndirect course, but by a circuitous route, which would make a difference\nof at least six or seven days; and that they did this that they might\nnot be seen by some other tribes who were located in their direct route,\nand who might give information. She said that it was she who had written\nthe Indian letter which Malachi had received the autumn before, and that\nshe had done it because she had been so kindly treated by Mr. and Mrs.\nCampbell, when she had been found in the forest with her ankle sprained.\nThat Percival was at the Indian lodges, quite well when they left, and\nthat if the Angry Snake did not receive a large quantity of powder and\nshot and a great many rifles in exchange for him, it was his intention\nto adopt the boy, as he was very partial to him. On being asked if the\nboy was happy, she replied that he was not at first, but now he was\nalmost an Indian; that he was seldom permitted to leave the lodges, and\nnever unless accompanied by the Angry Snake. In answer to their\nquestions as to the direction and distance to the lodges, she said that\nthey were about seven days' journey by the straight road; but that the\nparty with Miss Percival would not arrive there in less than fifteen\ndays, if so soon, as she was every day less able to travel. Having\nobtained all this information, a council was held, and Malachi spoke\nfirst, having been requested so to do.\n\n\"My opinion is this,\" said Malachi, \"that we can do no better than\nremain here at present, and wait till the woman is sufficiently\nrecovered to travel, and show us the direct road to the lodges. In two\nor three days she will probably be well enough to go with us, and then\nwe will take the direct road, and be there before them. The knowledge\nof the place and the paths will enable us to lay an ambush for them, and\nto rescue the young lady without much danger to ourselves. They will\nhave no idea of falling in with us, for they of course imagine the woman\nis dead; a tomahawk seldom fails.\"\n\nAfter a long parley, the advice of Malachi was considered the most\njudicious, and a further conversation with the Indian woman confirmed\nthem in their resolution. As they had no fear of the Indians discovering\nthat they were on their trail, Martin and Alfred went out in pursuit of\ngame for provisions, while the others raised up a large hut with\nbranches of trees, for the accommodation of the whole party. In the\nevening Martin and Alfred returned, carrying a fine buck between them.\nThe fire was lighted, and very soon all were busy cooking and eating.\nThe Indian woman also begged for something to eat, and her recovery was\nnow no longer considered doubtful.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n\nIt was a great annoyance to Captain Sinclair to have to wait in this\nmanner, but there was no help for it. He was satisfied that it was the\nmost prudent course, and therefore raised no objection. Alfred too was\nuneasy at the delay, as he was aware how anxious his father and mother\nwould be during the whole time of their absence. They were glad,\nhowever, to find that the Indian woman recovered rapidly, and on the\nfifth day of their taking up their abode in the forest, she said that\nshe was able to travel if they walked slow. It was therefore agreed that\non the sixth day they should start again, and they did so, having saved\ntheir salt provisions, that they might not be compelled to stop, or use\ntheir rifles to procure food. The evening before, they roasted as much\nvenison as they thought they could consume while it was good, and at\ndaylight again proceeded, not to follow the trail, but guided by the\nIndian woman, in a direct course for the lodges of the Indian band under\nthe Angry Snake.\n\nAs they had now only to proceed as fast as they could without tiring\nthe poor Indian woman, whose head was bound up, and who was still weak\nfrom loss of blood, they made a tolerable day's journey, and halted as\nbefore. Thus they continued their route till the sixth day, when as they\ndrew up for the night, the Indian stated that they were only three or\nfour miles from the Indians' lodges, which they sought. Thereupon a\ncouncil was held as to how they should proceed, and at last it was\nagreed upon that they should be guided by the Indian woman to a spot\nwhere they might be concealed, as near as possible to the lodges, and\nthat when the party had arrived there, that the woman and Malachi should\ngo and reconnoiter, to ascertain whether the chief and his band with\nMary Percival had returned or not. The night was passed very\nimpatiently, and without sleep by most of them, so anxious were they for\nthe morrow. Long before break of day they again started, advancing with\ngreat caution, and were led by the Indian till they were within one\nhundred and fifty yards of the lodges, in a thick cluster of young\nspruce, which completely secured them from discovery. Shortly afterward\nMalachi and the Indian woman, creeping on all fours, disappeared in the\nsurrounding brush wood, that they might, if possible, gain more\nintelligence from listening. In the meantime, the party had their eyes\non the lodges, waiting to see who should come out as soon as the sun\nrose, for it was hardly clear daybreak when they arrived at their place\nof concealment.\n\nThey had remained there about half an hour, when they perceived an\nIndian lad come out of one of the lodges. He was dressed in leggins and\nIndian shirt of deer skin, and carried in his hand his bow and arrows.\nAn eagle's feather was stuck in his hair above the left ear, which\nmarked him as the son of a chief.\n\n\"That's my brother Percival,\" said John in a low tone.\n\n\"Percival!\" replied Alfred, \"is it possible?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" whispered the Strawberry, \"it is Percival, but don't speak so\nloud.\"\n\n\"Well, they have turned him into a regular Indian,\" said Alfred; \"we\nshall have to make a pale face of him again.\"\n\nPercival, for he it was, looked round for some time, and at last\nperceiving a crow flying over his head, he drew his bow, and the arrow\nbrought the bird down at his feet.\n\n\"A capital shot,\" said Captain Sinclair, \"the boy has learned something\nat all events. You could not do that, John.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied John, \"but they don't trust him with a rifle.\"\n\nThey waited some little time longer, when an Indian woman, and then an\nold man, came out, and in about a quarter of an hour afterward, three\nmore women and an Indian about twenty years old.\n\n\"I think we have the whole force now,\" said Martin.\n\n\"Yes, I think so too,\" replied Captain Sinclair. \"I wish Malachi would\ncome back, for I do not think he will find out more than we know\nourselves.\"\n\nIn about half an hour afterward, Malachi and the Indian woman returned;\nthey had crept in the brushwood to within fifty yards of the lodges, but\nwere afraid to go nearer, as the woman said that perhaps the dogs might\ngive the alarm; for two of them were left at home. The woman stated her\nconviction that the party had not come back, and now a council was again\nheld as to their proceedings. The Indian force was nothing--an old man,\none lad of twenty, and four women. These might be easily captured and\nsecured, but the question was whether it would be desirable so to do, as\nin case one should by any means escape, information of their arrival\nmight be conveyed to the absent party, and induce them not to come home\nwith Mary Percival. This question was debated in a low tone between\nMalachi, Captain Sinclair, and Alfred. At last John interrupted them by\nsaying, \"They are going out to hunt, the old and the young Indian and\nPercival--they have all their bows and arrows.\"\n\n\"The boy is right,\" said Malachi. \"Well, I consider this to decide the\nquestion. We can now capture the men without the women knowing any thing\nabout it. They will not expect them home till the evening, and even if\nthey do not come, they will not be surprised or alarmed; so now we had\nbetter let them go some way, and then follow them. If we secure them,\nwe can then decide what to do about the women.\"\n\nThis was agreed upon, and Malachi explained their intentions to the\nIndian woman, who approved of them, but said, \"The Old Raven (referring\nto the old Indian) is very cunning; you must be careful.\"\n\nThe party remained in their place of concealment for another quarter of\nan hour, till the two Indians and Percival had quitted the open space\nbefore the lodges, and had entered the woods. They then followed in a\nparallel direction, Malachi and John going ahead: Martin and Alfred\nfollowing so as to keep them in sight, and the remainder of the party at\nabout the same distance behind Martin and Alfred. They continued in this\nmanner their course through the woods for more than an hour, when a herd\nof deer darted past Malachi and John. They immediately stopped, and\ncrouched, to hide themselves. Martin and Alfred perceiving this,\nfollowed their example, and the rest of the party behind, at the motion\nof the Strawberry, did the same. Hardly had they done so, when one of\nthe herd, which had been pierced by an arrow, followed in the direction\nof the rest, and after a few bounds fell to the earth. A minute or two\nafterward the hunters made their appearance, and stood by the expiring\nbeast, where they remained for a minute or two talking, and then took\nout their knives to flay and cut it up. While they were thus employed,\nMalachi and John on one side, Alfred and Martin from another direction,\nand the rest of the party from a third, were creeping slowly up toward\nthem; but to surround them completely it was necessary the main party\nshould divide, and send one or two more to the eastward. Captain\nSinclair dispatched Graves and one of the soldiers, desiring them to\ncreep very softly till they arrived at a spot he pointed out, and then\nto wait for the signal to be given.\n\nAs the parties gradually approached nearer and nearer to the Indians and\nPercival, the Old Raven appeared to be uneasy; he looked round and round\nhim and once or twice laid his ear on the ground; whenever he did this,\nthey all stopped, and almost held their breaths.\n\n\"The Indian woman says that the Old Raven is suspicious; he is sure\nthat some one is in the woods near him, and she thinks that she had\nbetter go to him,\" said the Strawberry to Captain Sinclair.\n\n\"Let her go,\" said Captain Sinclair.\n\nThe Indian rose, and walked up in the direction of the Indians, who\nimmediately turned to her as she approached. She spoke to them, and\nappeared to be telling them how it was that she returned. At all events,\nshe occupied the attention of the Old Raven till the parties were close\nto them, when Malachi arose, and immediately all the others did the\nsame, and rushed upon them. After a short and useless struggle, they\nwere secured, but not before the younger Indian had wounded one of the\nsoldiers, by stabbing him with his knife. The thongs were already fast\nround the arms and legs of the Indians, when Percival, who had not been\ntied, again attempted to escape, and by the direction of Malachi, he was\nbound, as well as the other two.\n\nAs soon as the prisoners were secured, Martin and Graves and the\nsoldiers employed themselves cutting up the venison and preparing it for\ndinner, while the Strawberry and the Indian woman were collecting wood\nfor a fire. In the meanwhile Captain Sinclair, Malachi, and John were\nseated by the prisoners, and directing their attention to Percival, whom\nthey had been compelled to bind, that he might not make his escape; for\nhis sojourn of nearly two years in the woods with the Indians, without\nseeing the face of a white man, had (as has been invariably proved to be\nthe fact in every instance where the parties were very young) wholly\nobliterated, for the time, his recollections of his former life--so\nrapid is our falling off to the savage state. To the questions of Alfred\nhe returned no reply, and appeared not to understand him.\n\n\"Let me try him, sir,\" said Malachi, \"I will speak to him in the Indian\ntongue, he has perhaps forgotten his own. It's wonderful how soon we\nreturn to a state of nature when we are once in the woods.\"\n\nMalachi then spoke to Percival in the Indian language; Percival listened\nfor some time, and at last replied in the same tongue.\n\n\"What does he say, Malachi?\" said Alfred.\n\n\"He says he will sing his own death song; that he is the son of a\nwarrior, and he will die like a brave.\"\n\n\"Why, the boy is metamorphosed,\" said Captain Sinclair; \"is it possible\nthat so short a time could have produced this?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"in young people a very short time will\nchange them thus, but it won't last long. If he were to meet again with\nhis mother at the settlement, he would by degrees forget his Indian life\nand become reconciled; a woman has more effect than a man. Let the\nStrawberry speak to him. You see, sir, he is bound, and considers\nhimself a captive, and let him loose we must not, until we have done our\nwork; after that, there will be no fear, and when he has been with us a\nshort time, he will come all right again.\"\n\nMalachi called the Strawberry, and told her to speak to Percival about\nhis home and his mother, and every thing connected with the farm.\n\nThe Strawberry sat down by Percival, and in her soft tones talked to him\nin her own tongue of his father and mother, of his cousins, and how he\nhad been taken by the Indians when he was hunting; how his mother had\nwept for him, and all had lamented his loss; running on in a low musical\nkey from one thing to another connected and associated with his former\nlife in the settlement, and it was evident that at last he now listened\nwith attention. The Strawberry continued to talk to him thus, for more\nthan an hour, when Alfred again addressed him and said, \"Percival, don't\nyou know me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Percival in English, \"I do; you are my brother Alfred.\"\n\n\"All's right now, sir,\" said Malachi; \"only he must be kept fast; but\nthe lad's coming to his senses again. The Strawberry will talk to him\nagain by and by.\"\n\nThey then sat down to their meal; the two Indians were removed to a\ndistance under the guard of one of the soldiers, but Percival remained\nwith them. John sat by Percival, and cutting off a tempting bit of\nvenison, held it to his mouth, saying to him, \"Percival, when we go home\nagain, your hands shall be untied, and you shall have a rifle of your\nown instead of a bow and arrows; come, eat this.\"\n\nThis was a long speech for John, but it produced its effect, for\nPercival opened his mouth for the venison, and being fed by John, made a\nvery good dinner. As soon as their meal was over, they consulted as to\nwhat steps should next be taken. The question discussed was whether they\nshould now capture the women who were left in the lodges, or remain\nquiet till the Angry Snake and his party arrived?\n\nMalachi's opinion was as follows:--\n\n\"I think we had at all events better wait till to-morrow, sir; you see,\nthe women will not be at all surprised at the hunting party not\nreturning for even a day or two, as they know that they will not return\nwithout game, and may not find it immediately; their absence, therefore,\nwill create no suspicion of our being here. I think we should return to\nour former place of concealment, and watch their motions. There is no\nsaying when the party with Miss Percival may return, they may have\narrived while we have been away, or they may come to-morrow. It will be\nbetter, therefore, not to encumber ourselves with more prisoners unless\nit is necessary.\"\n\nThis opinion was at last assented to, and they set off, on their return\nto the Indian lodges. They arrived about an hour before dusk at their\nhiding-place, having taken the precaution to gag the two Indians for\nfear of their giving a whoop as notice of their capture. Percival was\nvery quiet, and had begun to talk a little with John.\n\nScarcely had they been five minutes again concealed among the spruce fir\ntrees, when they heard a distant whoop from the woods on the other side\nof the lodges.\n\n\"They are now coming on,\" said Martin; \"that is their signal.\"\n\nOne of the Indian women from the lodges returned the whoop.\n\n\"Yes, sir, they are coming,\" said Malachi. \"Pray, Captain Sinclair, be\nquiet and sit down; you will ruin all our plans.\"\n\n\"Down, Sinclair, I beg,\" said Alfred.\n\nCaptain Sinclair, who was very much excited, nevertheless did as he was\nrequested.\n\n\"Oh, Alfred!\" said he; \"she's so near.\"\n\n\"Yes, my good fellow, but if you wish her nearer, you must be prudent.\"\n\n\"True, very true,\" replied Captain Sinclair.\n\nIn about half an hour more, the Angry Snake and his party were seen to\nemerge from the woods, and it was perceived that four of the Indians\ncarried a litter made of branches between them.\n\n\"She could walk no further, sir,\" said Malachi to Captain Sinclair; \"so\nthey are carrying her; I told you that they would not hurt her.\"\n\n\"Let me once see her get out of the litter, and I shall be satisfied,\"\nreplied Captain Sinclair.\n\nThe Indians soon were over the clearing, and stopped at one of the\nlodges; Mary Percival was lifted out, and was seen to walk with\ndifficulty into the wigwam, followed by two of the Indian women.\n\nA short parley took place between the Angry Snake and the other two\nwomen, and the chief and rest of the party then went into another lodge.\n\n\"All's right so far, sir,\" observed Malachi; \"they have left her to the\ncharge of the two women in a lodge by herself, and so there will be no\nfear for her when we make the attack, which I think we must do very\nshortly, for if it is quite dark, some of them may escape, and may\ntrouble us afterward.\"\n\n\"Let us do it immediately,\" said Captain Sinclair.\n\n\"No, not immediately, sir; we have yet an hour and a half daylight. We\nwill wait one hour, for I think that as they have nothing to eat, and\nare pretty well tired from carrying Miss Percival, they will, in all\nprobability, go to sleep, as Indians always do. An hour hence will be\nthe best time for us to fall upon them.\"\n\n\"You are right, Malachi,\" replied Alfred. \"Sinclair, you must curb your\nimpatience.\"\n\n\"I must, I believe,\" replied Captain Sinclair; \"but it will be a tedious\nhour for me. Let us pass it away in making our arrangements; we have but\nsix to deal with.\"\n\n\"And only two rifles,\" replied Alfred; \"so we are pretty sure of\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"We must watch first,\" said Martin, \"to see if they all continue in the\nsame lodge, for if they divide, we must arrange accordingly. Who will\nremain with the prisoners?\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said John, in a positive manner.\n\n\"You must, John, if it be decided that you do,\" said Alfred.\n\n\"Better not, sir,\" replied Malachi; \"for as soon as the boy hears the\ncrack of the rifles, he will leave his prisoners, and join us; that I'm\nsure of. No, sir, the Strawberry can be left with the prisoners. I'll\ngive her my hunting-knife; that will be sufficient.\"\n\nThey remained for about half an hour more watching the lodges, but every\nthing appeared quiet, and not a single person came out. Having examined\nthe priming of the rifles, every man was directed to take up a certain\nposition, so as to surround the buildings and support each other. John\nwas appointed to the office of looking after his cousin Mary, and\npreventing the women from escaping with her from the lodge in which she\nwas confined; and John took his office willingly, as he considered it\none of importance, although it had been given him more with a view that\nhe might not be exposed to danger. Leaving the prisoners to the charge\nof the Strawberry, who, with her knife drawn, stood over them, ready to\nact upon the slightest attempt of escape on their part, the whole party\nnow crept softly toward the lodges, by the same path as had been taken\nby Malachi and the Indian woman. As soon as they had all arrived, they\nwaited for a few minutes, while Malachi reconnoitered, and when they\nperceived that he did so, they all rose up and hastened to their\nallotted stations round the lodge into which the Angry Snake and his\nfollowers had entered. The Indians appeared to be asleep, for every\nthing remained quiet.\n\n\"Let us first lead Miss Percival away to a place of safety,\" whispered\nCaptain Sinclair.\n\n\"Do you do it, then,\" said Alfred; \"there are plenty of us without you.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair hastened to the lodge in which Miss Percival had been\nplaced, and opened the door. Mary Percival, as soon as she beheld\nCaptain Sinclair, uttered a loud scream of delight, and, rising from\nthe skins on which she had been laid, fell upon his neck. Captain\nSinclair caught her in his arms, and was bearing her out of the lodge,\nwhen an Indian woman caught him by the coat; but John, who had entered,\nputting the muzzle of his rifle into their faces, they let go and\nretreated, and Captain Sinclair bore away Mary in his arms into the\nbrushwood, where the Strawberry was standing over the Indian prisoners.\nThe scream of Mary Percival had roused the Indians, who, after their\nexhaustion and privations, were in a sound sleep; but still no movement\nwas to be heard in the lodge, and a debate, between Malachi and Alfred,\nwhether they should enter the lodge or not, was put an end to by a rifle\nbeing fired from the lodge, and the fall of one of the soldiers, who was\nnext to Alfred. Another shot followed, and Martin received a bullet in\nhis shoulder, and then out bounded the Angry Snake, followed by his\nband, the chief whirling his tomahawk, and springing upon Malachi, while\nthe others attacked Alfred and Martin, who were nearest to the door of\nthe lodge. The rifle of Malachi met the breast of the Angry Snake as he\nadvanced, and the contents were discharged through his body. The other\nIndians fought desperately, but the whole of the attacking party closing\nin, they were overpowered. Only two of them, however, were taken alive,\nand these were seriously wounded. They were tied and laid on the ground.\n\n\"He was a bad man, sir,\" said Malachi, who was standing over the body of\nthe Indian chief; \"but he will do no more mischief.\"\n\n\"Are you much hurt, Martin?\" inquired Alfred.\n\n\"No, sir, not much; the ball has passed right through and touched no\nbone; so I am in luck. I'll go to the Strawberry, and get her to bind it\nup.\"\n\n\"He is quite dead, sir,\" said Graves, who was kneeling by the side of\nthe soldier who had been shot by the first rifle.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" exclaimed Alfred. \"Well, I'm not sorry that they\ncommenced the attack upon us; for I do not know whether I could have\nused my rifle unless they had done so.\"\n\n\"They never expected quarter, sir,\" said Malachi.\n\n\"I suppose not. Now, what are we to do with the women? They can do no\nharm.\"\n\n\"Not much, sir; but, at all events, we must put it out of their power.\nWe must take possession of all the weapons we can find in the lodges. We\nhave their two rifles; but we must collect all the bows and arrows,\ntomahawks, and knives, and either destroy or keep possession of them.\nJohn, will you look to that? Take Graves with you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied John, who with Graves, immediately commenced his search\nof the lodges.\n\nThe two women, who had been in the lodge with Mary Percival, had\nremained where they were, as John's rifle had kept them from leaving the\nlodge; but the other two had escaped into the woods during the affray.\nThis was of little consequence; indeed, the others were told that they\nmight go away, if they would; and as soon as they heard this from\nMalachi, they followed the example of their companions. John and Graves\nbrought out all the arms they could find, and Malachi and Alfred then\nwent to the bushes to which Mary Percival and Sinclair had previously\nretired. Alfred embraced his cousin, who was still too greatly agitated\nto say much, being almost overpowered by the sudden transition in all\nher thoughts and feelings:--and, in the variety of her emotions, perhaps\nthe most bewildering was that occasioned by the re-appearance of\nPercival,--like a restoration from the dead. Alfred was in consultation\nwith Malachi, when he perceived the flames bursting out of the lodges.\nMartin, as soon as his wound was dressed, had returned and set fire to\nthem.\n\n\"It's all right, sir,\" said Malachi; \"it will leave the proof of our\nvictory, and be a caution to other Indians.\"\n\n\"But what will become of the women?\"\n\n\"They will join some other band, sir, and tell the story. It is better\nthat they should.\"\n\n\"And our prisoners, what shall we do with them?\"\n\n\"Release them; by and by, sir, we shall have nothing to fear from them;\nbut we will first take them two or three days' march into the woods, in\ncase they have alliance with any other band whom they might call to\ntheir assistance.\"\n\n\"And the wounded Indians?\"\n\n\"Must be left to Providence, sir. We can not take them. We will leave\nthem provisions and water. The women will come back and find them; if\nthey are alive, they will look after them; if dead, bury them. But here\ncomes John, with some bears' skins which he has saved for Miss Mary;\nthat was thoughtful of the boy. As soon as the flames are down, we will\ntake up our quarters in the clearing, and set a watch for the night; and\nto-morrow, with the help of God, we will commence our journey back. We\nshall bring joy to your father and mother, and the sooner we do it the\nbetter; for they must be any thing but comfortable at our long absence.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary Percival; \"what a state of suspense they must be in!\nTruly, as the Bible saith, 'Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n\nNot one of the party slept much on this night. There was much to do, and\nmuch to be looked after. Captain Sinclair, as it may be supposed, was\nfully occupied with Mary Percival, of whom more anon. As soon as they\nhad taken up their position in the clearing, and made arrangements for\nthe accommodation of Mary, they relieved the Strawberry from her charge\nof the prisoners, whom they brought to the clearing, and made to sit\ndown close to them. Percival, who had not yet been freed from his bonds,\nwas now untied, and suffered to walk about, one of the men keeping close\nto him, and watching him carefully. The first object which caught his\neye, was the body of the Angry Snake. Percival looked on it for some\ntime, and then sat down by the side of it. There he remained for more\nthan two hours, without speaking, when a hole having been dug out by one\nof the party, the body was put in and covered up. Percival remained a\nfew minutes by the side of the grave, and then turned to the two\nwounded Indians. He brought them water, and spoke to them in the Indian\ntongue; but while he was still with them, Mary sent for him to speak\nwith him, for as yet she had scarcely seen him. The sight of Mary\nappeared to have a powerful effect upon the boy; he listened to her as\nshe soothed and caressed him, and appearing to be overcome with a\nvariety of sensations, he lay down, moaned, and at last fell fast\nasleep.\n\nThe soldier who had been shot by the Angry Snake was buried before they\nburied the chief. Martin's wound had been dressed by his wife, the\nStrawberry, who was very skillful in Indian surgery. She had previously\napplied cataplasms made from the bruised leaves which she and the Indian\nwoman had sought for, to the feet of Mary Percival, which were in a\nstate of great inflammation, and Mary had found herself already much\nrelieved by the application. Before the day dawned, the two Indians who\nhad been wounded, were dead, and were immediately buried by the side of\nthe chief.\n\nAlfred and Malachi had resolved to set off the next morning, on their\nreturn home, if they found it possible to convey Mary Percival; but\ntheir party was now reduced, as one of the soldiers had been killed, and\nMartin was incapable of service. The Indian woman would also be fully\nloaded with the extra rifles, the two which they had captured from the\nIndians, the one belonging to the soldier, and Martin's, who could not\ncarry any thing in his present state.\n\nThey were now only six effective men, as John could not be of much use\nin carrying, and, moreover, was appointed to watch Percival. Then they\nhad the two prisoners to take charge of, so that they were somewhat\nembarrassed. Malachi, however, proposed that they should make a litter\nof boughs, welded together very tight, and suspended on a pole so as to\nbe carried between two men. Mary Percival was not a very great weight,\nand, by relieving each other continually, they would be able to get some\nmiles every day, till Mary was well enough to walk with them. Alfred\nassented to this, and, as soon as it was daylight, went into the woods\nwith Malachi, to assist him in cutting the boughs. On their return, they\nfound that all the rest of the party were up, and that Mary felt little\nor no pain. They made their breakfast on their salt provisions, which\nwere now nearly expended, and as soon as their meal was over, they put\nMary upon the litter and set off, taking the Indian prisoners with them,\nas they thought it not yet advisable to give them their liberty. The\nfirst day they made but a few miles, as they were obliged to stop, that\nthey might procure some food. The party were left under a large tree,\nwhich was a good land-mark, under the charge of Captain Sinclair, while\nMalachi and Alfred went in search of game. At nightfall they returned\nwith a deer which they had killed, when the Strawberry informed them\nthat the Indian woman had told her, that about two miles to the\nsouthward there was a river which ran into the lake, and that there were\ntwo canoes belonging to the band, hauled up in the bushes on the beach;\nthat the river was broad and swift, and would soon take them to the\nlake, by the shores of which they could paddle the canoe to the\nsettlement. This appeared worthy of consideration, as it would in the\nend, perhaps, save time, and at all events allow Mary Percival to\nrecover. They decided that they would go to the river, and take the\ncanoes, as the Indian woman said that they were large enough to hold\nthem all.\n\nThe next morning, guided by the Indian woman, they set off in the\ndirection of the river, and arrived at it in the afternoon. They found\nthe canoes, which were large, and in good order, and having carried them\ndown to the beach, they resolved to put off their embarkation till the\nfollowing day, as they were again in want of provisions for their\nsubsistence. Alfred, Malachi and John went out this time, for Percival\nhad shown himself so quiet and contented, and had gradually become so\nfond of being near Mary Percival, that he appeared to have awakened from\nhis Indian dream, and renewed all his former associations. They did not,\ntherefore, think it necessary to watch him any more--indeed, he never\nwould leave Mary's side, and began now to ask many questions, which\nproved that he had recalled to mind much of what had been forgotten\nduring his long sojourn with the Indians. The hunters returned, having\nbeen very successful, and loaded with meat enough to last for four or\nfive days. At daylight the next morning, they led the prisoners about\nhalf a mile into the woods, and, pointing to the north as to the\ndirection they were to go, cast loose the deer-thongs which confined\nthem, and set them at liberty. Having done this, they embarked in the\ncanoes, and were soon gliding rapidly down the stream.\n\nThe river upon which they embarked, at that time little known to the\nEuropeans, is now called the river Thames, and the town built upon it is\nnamed London. It falls into the upper part of Lake Ontario, and is a\nfine rapid stream. For three days they paddled their canoes,\ndisembarking at night to sleep and cook their provisions, and on the\nfourth they were compelled to stop, that they might procure more food.\nThey were successful, and on the next day they entered the lake, about\ntwo hundred miles to the west of the settlement. Mary Percival was now\nquite recovered, and found her journey or voyage delightful; the country\nwas in full beauty; the trees waved their boughs down to the river side,\nand they did not fall in with any Indians, or perceive any lodges on the\nbank. Sometimes they started the deer which had come down to drink in\nthe stream, and on one occasion, as they rounded a point, they fell in\nwith a herd which were in the water swimming across, and in this\nposition they destroyed as many as they required for their food till\nthey hoped to arrive at the settlement.\n\nPercival was now quite reconciled to his removal from an Indian life,\nand appeared most anxious to rejoin his father and mother, of whom he\ntalked incessantly; for he had again recovered his English, which,\nstrange to say, although he perfectly understood it when spoken to, he\nhad almost forgotten to pronounce, and at first spoke with difficulty.\nThe weather was remarkably fine, and the waters of the lake were so\nsmooth, that they made rapid progress, although they invariably\ndisembarked at night. The only annoyance they had was from the\nmusquitoes, which rose in clouds as soon as they landed, and were not\nto be dispersed until they had lighted a very large fire, accompanied\nwith thick smoke; but this was a trifle compared with their joy at the\nhappy deliverance of the prisoners, and success of their expedition.\nMost grateful, indeed, were they to God for his mercies, and none more\nso than Mary Percival and Captain Sinclair, who never left her side till\nit was time to retire to rest.\n\nOn the sixth day, in the forenoon, they were delighted to perceive Fort\nFrontignac in the distance, and although the house at the settlement was\nhid from their sight by the point covered with wood which intervened,\nthey knew that they were not above four or five miles distant. In less\nthan another hour, they were abreast of the prairie, and landed at the\nspot where their own punt was moored. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell had not\nperceived the canoes, for, although anxiously looking out every day for\nthe return of the party, their eyes and attention were directed on land,\nnot having any idea of their return by water.\n\n\"My dear Alfred,\" said Mary, \"I do not think it will be prudent to let\nmy aunt see Percival at once; we must prepare her a little for his\nappearance. She has so long considered him as dead, that the shock may\nbe too great.\"\n\n\"You say true, my dear Mary. Then we will go forward with Captain\nSinclair and Malachi, and John. Let Percival be put in the middle of the\nremainder of the party, who must follow afterward, and then be taken up\nto Malachi's lodge. He can remain there with the Strawberry until we\ncome and fetch him.\"\n\nHaving made these arrangements, to which Percival was with difficulty\nmade to agree, they walked up as proposed, to the house. Outside of the\npalisade, they perceived Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, with their backs toward\nthem, looking toward the forest, in the direction which the party had\ntaken when they left. But when they were half-way from the beach, Henry\ncame out with Oscar from the cottage, and the dog, immediately\nperceiving them, bounded to them, barking with delight. Henry cried out,\n\"Father--mother, here they are,--here they come.\" Mr. and Mrs. Campbell\nof course turned round, and beheld the party advancing; they flew to\nmeet them, and as they caught Mary in their arms, all explanation for a\ntime was unnecessary--she was recovered, and that was sufficient for the\ntime.\n\n\"Come, mother, let us go into the house, that you may compose yourself a\nlittle,\" said Alfred,--that she might not perceive Percival among the\nparty that followed at a distance. \"Let me support you. Take my arm.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell, who trembled very much, did so, and thus turned away from\nthe group among whom Percival was walking. Emma was looking at them\nattentively, and was about to exclaim, when Captain Sinclair put his\nfinger to his lips.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the house, and had gone in, Alfred, in a few\nwords, gave them an account of what had passed--how successful they had\nbeen in their attempt, and how little they had to fear from the Indians\nin future.\n\n\"How grateful I am!\" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell. \"God be praised for all\nhis mercies! I was fearful that I should have lost you, my dear Mary, as\nwell as my poor boy. He is lost forever--but God's will be done.\"\n\n\"It is very strange, mother,\" said Alfred, \"but we heard, on our\njourney, that the Indians had found a white boy in the woods.\"\n\n\"Alas! not mine.\"\n\n\"I have reason to believe that it was Percival, my dear mother, and have\nhopes that he is yet alive.\"\n\n\"My dear Alfred, do not say so unless you have good cause; you little\nknow the yearnings of a mother's heart; the very suggestion of such a\nhope has thrown me into a state of agitation and nervousness of which\nyou can form no conception. I have been reconciled to the Divine will;\nlet me not return to a state of anxiety and repining.\"\n\n\"Do you think, my dear mother, that I would raise such hopes if I had\nnot good reason to suppose that they would be realized? No, my dear\nmother, I am not so cruel.\"\n\n\"Then you know that Percival is alive?\" said Mrs. Campbell, seizing\nAlfred by the arm.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my dear mother, I do know--I am certain that he is\nalive, and that it was he who was found by the Indians; and I have great\nhopes that we may recover him.\"\n\n\"God grant it! God grant it in his great mercy!\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"my\nheart is almost breaking with joy: may God sustain me! Oh, where is\nhe--my dear Alfred--where is he?\" continued Mrs. Campbell, Alfred made\nno reply, but a flood of tears came to her relief.\n\n\"I will explain it to you when you are more composed, my dear mother.\nEmma, you have not said one word to me.\"\n\n\"I have been too much overjoyed to speak, Alfred,\" replied Emma,\nextending her hand to him, \"but no one welcomes your return more\nsincerely than I do, and no one is more grateful to you for having\nbrought Mary back.\"\n\n\"Now, Alfred, I am calm,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"so let me hear at once\nall you know.\"\n\n\"I see you are calm, my dear mother, and I therefore now tell you that\nPercival is not far off.\"\n\n\"Alfred! he is here; I am sure he is.\"\n\n\"He is with Malachi and the Strawberry; in a minute I will bring him.\"\n\nAlfred left the house: the intelligence was almost too overpowering for\nMrs. Campbell. Mary and Emma hastened to her, and supported her. In\nanother minute Alfred returned with Percival, and the mother embraced\nand wept over her long lost child,--and then gave him to his father's\narms.\n\n\"How this has happened, and by what merciful interference he has been\npreserved and restored to us,\" said Mr. Campbell, when their first\nemotions were over, \"we have yet to learn; but one thing we do know, and\nare sure of, that it is by the goodness of God alone. Let us return our\nthanks while our hearts are yet warm with gratitude and love, and may\nour thanksgiving be graciously received.\"\n\nMr. Campbell kneeled down, and his example was followed by all the rest\nof the party assembled. In a fervent tone he returned thanks for the\nrecent mercies vouchsafed to his family, which, he expressed a hope,\nwould never be forgotten, but would prove a powerful inducement to them\nall, to lead a more devout life of faith in Him who had so graciously\nsupported them in the hour of peril and affliction,--who had so\nwonderfully restored to them their lost treasures, and turned all their\ngloom into sunshine,--filling their hearts with joy and gladness.\n\n\"And now, my dear Alfred,\" said Mrs. Campbell, whose arms still\nencircled the neck of Percival, \"do pray tell us what has taken place,\nand how you recovered Mary and this dear boy.\"\n\nAlfred then entered into his detail, first stating the knowledge which\nCaptain Sinclair, Malachi, and himself had of Percival being still in\nexistence from the letter written by the Indian woman,--the seizure and\nconfinement of the Young Otter in consequence, which was retaliated by\nthe abduction of Mary. When he had finished, Mr. Campbell said--\n\n\"And poor Martin, where is he, that I may thank him?\"\n\n\"He is at his own lodge, with the Strawberry, who is dressing his wound;\nfor we have not been able to do so for two or three days, and it has\nbecome very painful.\"\n\n\"We owe him a large debt of gratitude,\" said Mr. Campbell; \"he has\nsuffered much on our account. And your poor man, Captain Sinclair, who\nfell!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Sinclair, \"he was one of our best men--but it was the\nwill of Heaven. He lost his life in the recovery of my dear Mary, and I\nshall not forget his wife and child, you may depend upon it.\"\n\n\"Now, Mary, let us have your narrative of what passed when you were in\ncompany of the Indians, before your rescue.\"\n\n\"I was, as you know, gathering the cranberries in the Cedar Swamp, when\nI was suddenly seized, and something was thrust against my mouth, so\nthat I had no time or power to cry out. My head was then wrapped up in\nsome folds of blanket, by which I was almost suffocated, and I was then\nlifted up and borne away by two or three men. For a time I kept my\nsenses, but at last the suffocation was so great, that my head swam, and\nI believe I fainted, for I do not recollect being put down; yet after a\ntime I found myself lying under a tree, and surrounded by five or six\nIndians, who were squatted round me. I was not a little terrified, as\nyou may imagine. They neither moved nor spoke for some time; I\nendeavored to rise, but a hand on my shoulder kept me down, and I did\nnot attempt a useless resistance. Soon afterward, an Indian woman\nbrought me some water, and I immediately recognized her as the one whom\nwe had succored when we found her in the woods. This gave me courage and\nhope, though her countenance was immovable, and I could not perceive,\neven by her eyes, that she attempted any recognition; but reflection\nconvinced me that, if she intended to help me, she was right in so\ndoing. After I had raised myself, and drunk some water, the Indians had\na talk in a low voice, I observed that they paid deference to one, and\nfrom the description which my father and Alfred had given of the Angry\nSnake, I felt sure that it was he. We remained about half an hour on\nthis spot, when they rose, and made signs to me that I was to come with\nthem. Of course I could do no otherwise, and we walked till night came\non, when I was, as you may imagine, not a little tired. They then left\nme with the Indian woman, retiring a few yards from me. The woman made\nsigns that I was to sleep, and although I thought that was impossible, I\nwas so much fatigued that, after putting up my prayers to the Almighty,\nI had not lain down many minutes before I was fast asleep.\n\n\"Before daylight, I was awakened by their voices, and the woman brought\nme a handful of parched Indian corn; not quite so good a breakfast as I\nhad been accustomed to; but I was hungry, and I contrived to eat it. As\nsoon as the day broke we set off again, and toward evening arrived at a\nlake. A canoe was brought out from some bushes; we all got into it, and\npaddled up along the banks for two or three hours, when we disembarked\nand renewed our journey. My feet were now becoming very sore and\npainful, for they were blistered all over, and I could scarcely get\nalong; they compelled me, however, to proceed, not using any great\nforce, but still dragging me and pushing me, to make me keep up with\nthem. I soon perceived that I was a prisoner only, and not likely to be\nill treated if I complied with their wishes. Toward evening I could\nhardly put one foot before the other, for they had obliged me to walk in\nthe water of a stream for two or three miles, and my shoes were quite\nworn out in consequence. At night they again stopped, and the Indian\nwoman prepared some herbs, and applied them to my feet. This gave me\ngreat relief, but still she continued to take no notice of any signs I\nmade to her. The next morning I found I had received so much benefit\nfrom the application of the herbs, that for the first half of the day I\nwalked on pretty well, and was a little in advance, when, hearing the\nchief speak in an angry tone behind me, I turned round, and, to my\nhorror, saw him raise his tomahawk, and strike down the poor Indian\nwoman. I could not refrain from hastening to her; but I had just time to\nperceive that her skull was cloven, and that she was, as I imagined,\ndead, when I was dragged away and forced to continue my journey. You may\nimagine how my blood curdled at this scene, and how great were now my\napprehensions for myself. Why I had been carried away I knew not, for I\nwas as ignorant as you were of Percival being alive, and of the Young\nOtter having been detained at the fort. My idea was, when the chief\nstruck down the Indian woman, that it was to get rid of her, and that I\nwas to replace her. This idea was almost madness, but still I had hope,\nand I prayed as I walked along to that God who sees the most secret act,\nand hears the most silent prayer of the heart, and I felt an assurance\nwhile praying that I should be rescued. I knew that my absence would be\nimmediately discovered, and that there were those who would risk their\nlives to rescue me, if I was still in existence; and I therefore used\nall my efforts to walk on as fast as I could, and not irritate the\nIndians. But that night I had no one to dress my feet, which were\nbleeding and very much swelled, and I was very wretched when I lay down\nalone. I could not drive from my thoughts the poor Indian woman\nweltering in her blood, and murdered for no crime or fault--nothing that\nI could discover. The next morning, as usual, my food was some parched\nIndian corn, and of that I received only a handful for my sustenance\nduring the twenty-four hours; however, hunger I never felt, I had too\nmuch pain. I was able to drag myself on till about noon, when I felt\nthat I could not proceed further. I stopped and sat down; the chief\nordered me to get up again by signs; I pointed to my feet, which were\nnow swelled above the ankles, but he insisted, and raised his tomahawk\nto frighten me into compliance. I was so worn out, that I could have\nalmost received the blow with thankfulness, but I remembered you, my\ndear uncle and aunt and others, and resolved for your sakes to make one\nmore effort. I did so; I ran and walked for an hour more in perfect\nagony; at last nature could support the pain no longer, and I fell\ninsensible.\"\n\n\"My poor Mary!\" exclaimed Emma.\n\n\"I thought of you often and often, my dear sister,\" replied Mary,\nkissing her.\n\n\"I believe it was a long while before I came to my senses,\" continued\nMary, \"for when I did, I found that the Indians were very busy weaving\nbranches into a sort of litter. As soon as they had finished, they put\nme upon it, and I was carried by two of them swinging on a pole which\nthey put on their shoulders. I need hardly say, that the journey was now\nmore agreeable than it was before, although my feet were in a dreadful\nstate, and gave me much pain. That night we stopped by a rivulet, and I\nkept my feet in the water for two or three hours, which brought down the\ninflammation and swelling very much, and I contrived after that to gain\nsome sleep. They carried me one more day, when they considered that they\nhad done enough, and I was again ordered to walk; I did so for two days,\nand was then in the same condition as before. A litter was therefore\nagain constructed, and I was carried till I arrived at the lodges of the\nAngry Snake and his band. What passed from that time you have heard from\nAlfred.\"\n\nWhen Mary Percival had finished her narrative, they all sat down to\nsupper, and it hardly need be said that Mr. Campbell did not fail,\nbefore they retired to rest, again to pour forth his thanksgivings to\nthe Almighty for the preservation of those who were so dear. The next\nmorning, they all rose in health and spirits. Martin came early to the\nhouse with the Strawberry; his wound was much better, and he received\nthe thanks and condolence of Mr. and Mrs. Campbell.\n\nWhen they were at breakfast, Mr. Campbell said, \"John, in our joy at\nseeing your brother and cousin again, I quite forgot to scold you for\nrunning away as you did.\"\n\n\"Then don't do it now, sir,\" said Malachi, \"for he was very useful, I\ncan assure you.\"\n\n\"No, I won't scold him now,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"but he must not act\nso another time. If he had confided to me his anxious wish to join you,\nI should probably have given my permission.\"\n\n\"I must now take my leave, and return to the fort,\" said Captain\nSinclair; \"I do, however, trust I shall see you all again in a few days,\nbut I must report the results of the expedition, and the death of poor\nWatkins. May I borrow one of your horses, Mr. Campbell?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Campbell; \"you know the _bateau_ is expected\nevery day from Montreal; perhaps you will bring us our letters when it\narrives.\"\n\nCaptain Sinclair took his leave, as it may be imagined, very\nreluctantly, and in a day or two the family again settled down to their\nusual occupations. The emigrants had, during the absence of the\nexpedition, gathered in a great portion of the corn, and now all hands\nwere employed in finishing the harvest.\n\n\"How happy we are now, Mary,\" said Emma to her sister, as they were\nwalking by the stream watching John, who was catching trout.\n\n\"Yes, my dear Emma, we have had a lesson which will, I trust, prevent\nany future repining, if we have felt any, at our present position. The\nmisery we have been rescued from has shown us how much we have to be\nthankful for. We have nothing more to fear from the Indians, and I feel\nas if I could now pass the remainder of my life here in peace and\nthankfulness.\"\n\n\"Not without Captain Sinclair?\"\n\n\"Not always without him; the time will, I trust, come when I may reward\nhim for his patience and his regard for me; but it has not yet come; and\nit's for my uncle and aunt to decide when it shall. Where's Percival?\"\n\n\"He is gone into the woods with Malachi, and with a rifle on his\nshoulder, of which he is not a little proud. John is not at all jealous.\nHe says that Percival ought to know how to fire a rifle, and throw away\nthat foolish bow and arrow. Do you not think that his residence among\nthe Indians has made a great change in Percival?\"\n\n\"A very great one; he is more manly and more taciturn; he appears to\nthink more and talk less. But Henry is beckoning to us. Dinner is ready,\nand we must not keep hungry people waiting.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Emma; \"for in that case I should keep myself waiting.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n\nCaptain Sinclair on his return to Fort Frontignac reported to the\nColonel the successful result of the expedition, and was warmly\ncongratulated upon it, as the Colonel had been made acquainted with the\nengagement between him and Mary Percival. The Young Otter, who had\nremained in confinement during Captain Sinclair's absence, was now set\nat liberty; and the Colonel, who was aware that Captain Sinclair must be\nvery anxious to remain at the settlement for a short time after what had\noccurred, very kindly offered him leave for a few days, which it may be\nsupposed Captain Sinclair did not fail to avail himself of. The Colonel\nat the same time sent a message to Mr. Campbell, stating that as soon as\nthe _bateaux_ should arrive from Montreal, he would bring any letters or\nnewspapers that might arrive for them, and take that opportunity of\noffering in person his congratulations.\n\nCaptain Sinclair did not, however, return for two or three days, as he\nhad many letters to write in answer to those which had arrived during\nhis absence. On his return to the settlement, he found them all well\nand happy; Mary quite recovered from her fatigue, and every thing going\non in the same quiet order and method as if the expedition had never\ntaken place, and had never been necessary. Indeed, nothing appeared now\nwanting to the happiness of the whole party, and their affairs were\nprospering. The emigrants who had joined Mr. Campbell were industrious\nand intelligent, very civil, and very useful. They paid the greatest\nrespect to Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, who were certainly very liberal and\nkind to them, assisting them in every way in their power. Although the\nfarm had been so much increased, the labor was light, from the quantity\nof hands they could command; the stock had increased very fast; old\nGraves had taken charge of the mill during the absence of Alfred and\nMartin, and had expressed his wish to continue in that employment, which\nAlfred gladly gave up. In short, peace and plenty reigned in the\nsettlement, and Alfred's words when he recommended his father to go to\nCanada, had every prospect of becoming true--that his father would be\nindependent, if not rich, and leave his children the same. In three days\nCaptain Sinclair arrived; he was received with great warmth by all the\nparty, and after dinner was over, Mr. Campbell addressed the family as\nfollows:--\n\n\"My dear children, your mother and I have had some conversation on one\nor two points, and we have come to the decision that having so much to\nthank God for, in his kindness and mercies shown toward us, it would be\nselfish on our parts if we did not consult the happiness of others. We\nare now independent, and with every prospect of being more so every day;\nwe are no longer isolated, but surrounded by those who are attached to\nus and will protect us should there be any occasion. In short, we are\nliving in comfort and security, and we trust to Providence that we shall\ncontinue so to do. You, my dear Alfred, generously abandoned your\nprofession to which you were so partial, to come and protect us in the\nwilderness, and we knew too well the value of your services not to\naccept them, although we were fully aware of the sacrifice which you\nmade; but we are no longer in the wilderness, and no longer require your\nstrong arm and bold heart. We have therefore decided that it is our\nduty no longer to keep you from the profession to which you belong, but,\non the contrary, to recommend you now to rejoin and follow up your\ncareer, which we trust in God may prove as prosperous as we are\nconvinced it will be honorable. Take our best thanks, my dear boy, for\nyour kindness to us, and now consider yourself at liberty to return to\nEngland, and rejoin the service as soon as you please.\n\n\"And now I must address you, my dear Mary; you and your sister\naccompanied us here, and since you have been with us, have cheered us\nduring our stay by your attentions and unwearied cheerfulness under all\nthe privations which we at first had to encounter. You have engaged the\naffections of an honorable and deserving man, but at the same time have\nnever shown the least disposition to leave us; indeed, we know what your\ndetermination has been, but your aunt and I consider it our present duty\nto say, that much as we shall regret to part with one so dear, you must\nno longer sacrifice yourself for us, but make him happy who so well\ndeserves you. That you will remain here is of course out of the\nquestion; your husband's connections and fortune require that he should\nreturn to England, and not bury himself in the woods of Canada. You have\ntherefore our full permission, and I may say, it will be most pleasing\nto us, if you no longer delay your union with Captain Sinclair and\nfollow your husband; whenever and wherever you go, you will have our\nblessing and our prayers, and the satisfaction of knowing that you have\nbeen to us as a dutiful daughter, and that we love you as dearly as it\nis possible for parents to do. Take her, Captain Sinclair, from my\nhands, and take with her our blessings and best wishes for your\nhappiness, which I do not doubt will be as great as we can expect in\nthis checkered world; for a dutiful daughter will always become a good\nwife.\"\n\nMary, who was sitting between Mrs. Campbell and Captain Sinclair, fell\nupon her aunt's neck and wept; Mr. Campbell extended his hand to Captain\nSinclair, who expressed in return his warmest thanks and gratitude.\nAlfred, who had said nothing more, went up to his mother and kissed\nher.\n\n\"I wish you to go, Alfred,\" said his mother; \"I wish you to rejoin a\nservice to which you are a credit. Do not believe otherwise, or that I\nshall grieve too much at your departure.\"\n\n\"Go, my son,\" said Mr. Campbell, shaking him by the hand, \"and let me\nsee you a post-captain before I die.\"\n\nMrs. Campbell now took Mary Percival into the next room, that she might\ncompose herself, and Captain Sinclair ventured to follow. Every one\nappeared happy at this announcement of Mr. Campbell except Emma, who\nlooked unusually serious. Alfred, perceiving it, said to her, \"Emma, you\nare very grave at the idea of losing Mary, and I do not wonder at it,\nbut you will have one consolation,--you will lose me too, and I shall no\nlonger plague you as you continually complain that I do.\"\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" replied Emma, half angry; \"well, you _are_ a\ngreat plague, and the sooner you go--\"\n\nEmma did not, however, finish her speech, but left the room, to join her\nsister.\n\nNow that Mr. Campbell had announced his wishes, the subject of Mary's\nmarriage and Alfred's return to the service was, for a few days, the\ncontinual subject of discussion. It was decided that Mary should be\nmarried in a month, by the chaplain of the fort, who had returned, and\nthat Captain Sinclair, with his wife and Alfred, should leave the\nsettlement at the end of September, so as to arrive at Quebec in good\ntime for sailing before the winter should set in. It was now the last\nweek in August, so that there was not much time to pass away previous to\ntheir departure. Captain Sinclair returned to the fort, to make the\nColonel acquainted with what had passed, and to take the necessary steps\nfor leave of absence, and his return to England. This, from his interest\nwith the Governor, he was sure to obtain, and when in England, it would\nbe time sufficient to decide whether he should leave that service or\nexchange into some regiment at home. As every prospect of war or\ndisturbance in Canada was now over, he could take either step without\nany censure being laid upon him.\n\nA week afterward, the _bateaux_ arrived from Montreal, and the Colonel\nand Captain Sinclair made their appearance at the settlement, bringing\nwith them the letters and papers from England.\n\nHaving received the congratulations of the Colonel, Mr. and Mrs.\nCampbell, with his permission, opened their letters, for all the family\nwere present, and all, as usual, anxious to hear the news. The first\nletter Mr. Campbell opened, to the surprise of all, produced an\nimmediate change in his countenance. He read it a second time, and\nlaying it down on his knee, appeared to remain in a state of complete\nabstraction.\n\n\"No bad news, I hope, Campbell?\" said his wife anxiously, as all the\nrest looked upon him with astonishment.\n\n\"No, my dear Emily, no bad news, but most unexpected news; such as it\nhas been my fortune in life to receive once before this time. You\nremember, although years have since passed, the letter that was brought\nto us in our little parlor--\"\n\n\"Which put you in possession of Wexton Hall, Campbell.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did refer to that; but I will not keep you all in longer\nsuspense. This is but a counterpart of the former letter.\"\n\nMr. Campbell then read as follows:--\n                                                      \"May 7, 18--\n\n     \"Dear Sir,--It is with great pleasure that we have again to\n     communicate to you that you may return, as soon as you please, and\n     take possession of the Wexton Hall property.\n\n     \"You may remember that many months back Mr. Douglas Campbell\n     received a fall from his horse when hunting. No serious\n     consequences were anticipated, but it appears that his spine was\n     injured, and after some months' close confinement, he expired on\n     the 9th of April. As Mr. Douglas Campbell has left no issue, and\n     you are the next in tail, you have now undisputed possession of the\n     property which you so honorably surrendered some years since.\n\n     \"I have taken upon myself to act as your agent since Mr. Campbell's\n     decease. Mrs. D. Campbell has a handsome settlement upon the\n     property, which will of course fall in upon her demise. Waiting\n     your commands,\n\n                                            \"I am, dear sir,\n\n                                                 \"Yours truly,\n\n                                                    \"J. HARVEY.\"\n\n\"Mr. Campbell, I congratulate you with all my heart,\" said the Colonel,\nrising up, and taking his hand. \"You have proved yourself deserving of\nsuch good fortune; Mrs. Campbell, I need hardly add that my\ncongratulations extend to you.\"\n\nSurprise at first rendered Mrs. Campbell mute; at last she said--\n\n\"We are in the hands of Him, and do but execute His will. For your sake,\nmy dear Campbell, for the children's sake, perhaps, I ought to\nrejoice--we hardly know. That I am happy here, now that my children have\nbeen restored to me, I confess. I doubt whether that happiness will be\nincreased by the return to Wexton Hall; at all events, I shall leave\nthis place with regret. We have had too many revolutions of fortune,\nCampbell, since we have been united, not to have learned by experience\nthat a peaceful, quiet, and contented home is more necessary to our\nhappiness than riches.\"\n\n\"I feel as you do, Emily,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"but we are growing\nold, and have been taught wisdom practically, by the events of a\ncheckered life. Our children, I perceive, think otherwise--nor do I\nwonder at it.\"\n\n\"I shan't go,\" said John; \"I shall only be sent to school; no master\nshall flog me--I'm a man.\"\n\n\"Nor me,\" cried Percival.\n\nThe Colonel and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, as well as the elder portion of\nthe party, could not help smiling at the exclamation of the two boys.\nThey had both played the part of men, and it was but too evident how\nunfitted they would be for future scholastic discipline.\n\n\"You shall neither of you go to school,\" replied Mr. Campbell, \"but\nstill you must render yourselves fit for your stations in life, by\nimproving your minds, and attending those who will instruct you.\"\n\nIt is hard to say whether much real joy was felt by any of the party at\nthe prospect of returning to England. It is true that Mary Percival was\ndelighted at the idea of not being so far from her aunt and uncle, and\nthat Emma was better pleased to be in England, for reasons which she\nkept to herself. But it was not the coming into the large property which\noccasioned pleasure to any of them. However, if there was not much\npleasure derived from this re-accession to property, Mr. and Mrs.\nCampbell knew their duty too well to hesitate, and every preparation was\ncommenced for their return along with Alfred and Captain Sinclair. John,\nhowever, still continued obstinate in declaring that he would not go,\nand Percival was very much of John's opinion, although he did not speak\nso plainly.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were alone, the former said to his wife,--\n\n\"I do not know what to do about John. He appears so resolute in his\ndetermination not to go with us, that I fear he will run away into the\nwoods at the time of our departure. He is now continually with Malachi\nand Martin, and appears to have severed himself from the family.\"\n\n\"It is hard to decide, Campbell; I have more than once thought it would\nbe better to leave him here. He is our youngest son. Henry will of\ncourse inherit the estate, and we shall have to provide for the others\nout of our savings. Now this property, by the time that John is of age,\nwill be of no inconsiderable value, and by no means a bad fortune for a\nyounger son. He appears so wedded to the woods and a life of nature,\nthat I fear it would only be the cause of continual regret and\ndiscontent if we did take him to England; and if so, what comfort or\nadvantage should we gain by his returning? I hardly know what to\nadvise.\"\n\n\"I have serious thoughts of leaving him here under the charge of Martin\nand Malachi,\" replied Mr. Campbell. \"He would be happy; by and by he\nwould be rich. What could he obtain more in England? But it must be for\nyou to decide, my dear Emily. I know a mother's feelings, and respect\nthem.\"\n\n\"I can not decide at once, my dear husband. I will first talk with John,\nand consult with Alfred and Henry.\"\n\nThe result of Mrs. Campbell's communicating with her sons, was a\ndecision that John should remain in Canada, under the charge of Martin\nand Malachi, who were to superintend the farm, and watch over him.\nMartin was to take charge of the farm. Malachi was to be John's\ncompanion in the woods, and old Graves, who had their mill under his\ncare, engaged to correspond with Mr. Campbell, and let them know how\nthings went on. When this was settled, John walked at least two inches\nhigher, and promised to write to his mother himself. The Colonel, when\nhe heard the arrangement, pledged himself that as long as he was in\ncommand of the fort, he would keep a watchful eye, not only over John,\nbut the whole of the settlement, and communicate occasionally with Mr.\nCampbell.\n\nA month after the receipt of the letter, the whole family, with the\nexception of John, embarked in two _bateaux_, and arrived at Montreal,\nwhere they remained a day or two, and then proceeded on to Quebec.\n\nAt Quebec, their agent had already taken all the cabins of one of the\nfinest ships for their passage, and after a run of six weeks, they once\nmore found themselves at Liverpool, from which town they posted to\nWexton Hall, Mrs. Douglas Campbell having retired to a property of her\nown in Scotland.\n\nWe have now finished our tale, and have only to inform our little\nreaders what were the after-lives of the Campbell family.\n\nHenry did not return to college, but remained with his father and mother\nat the Hall, employing himself in superintending for his father the\nproperty to which he afterward succeeded.\n\nAlfred was appointed to a ship commanded by Captain Lumley. He soon rose\nin the service, was highly distinguished as a gallant, clever officer,\nand four years after his return to England was married to his cousin\nEmma--at which the reader will not be surprised.\n\nMary Percival was married to Captain Sinclair, who sold out, and retired\nupon half-pay, to live upon his estate in Scotland.\n\nPercival went to college, and turned out a very clever lawyer.\n\nJohn remained in Canada until he was twenty years old, when he came home\nto see his father and mother. He had grown to six feet four inches high,\nand was stout in proportion. He was a very amusing fellow, and could\ntalk fast enough, but his chief conversation was upon hunting and\nsporting. The farm had been well conducted; the emigrants had adhered to\nthe agreements and were now cultivating for themselves. Martin had three\npapooses (as the Indians call the children) by the Strawberry. Malachi\nhad grown too old to go out often into the woods, and he sat by the fire\nin the winter, and basked in the sun at the door of the house during the\nsummer. Oscar was dead, but they had some fine puppies of his breed. Mr.\nCampbell gave John a deed, on his return, conveying to him the Canadian\nproperty, and shortly afterward John picked up a little Canadian wife at\nQuebec, who made him perfectly happy.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Campbell lived to a good old age, respected as long as they\nlived, and lamented when they died. They had known prosperity and\nadversity, and in each state of life had acquitted themselves with\nexemplary propriety, not having been elated by the one, or depressed by\nthe other. They knew that this world was a world of trial, and but a\npreparation for another; they therefore did their duty in that state of\nlife to which it pleased God to call them--proving in all their actions,\nthat they remembered their duty to their God, and their duty to their\nneighbor; living and dying (as I hope all my young readers will) sincere\nand good Christians.\n",
