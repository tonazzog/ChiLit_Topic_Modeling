Nesbit\n\n                      _To Rosamund,\n        chief among those for whom these tales are told,\n              The Book of Dragons is dedicated\n                  in the confident hope\n        that she, one of these days, will dedicate a book\n                  of her very own making\n                  to the one who now bids\n                  eight dreadful dragons\n                 crouch in all humbleness\n             at those little brown feet._\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of DRAGONS\n\n[THE BOOK OF BEASTS]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. The Book of Beasts\n\n\nHe happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all\nthe bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the\nnews was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front\ndoor and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man\ncome to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted\nsince the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the\ngas bracket.\n\nAnd then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, \"Master Lionel, dear,\nthey've come to fetch you to go and be King.\"\n\nThen she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands\nand brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept\nwriggling and fidgeting and saying, \"Oh, don't, Nurse,\" and, \"I'm sure\nmy ears are quite clean,\" or, \"Never mind my hair, it's all right,\" and,\n\"That'll do.\"\n\n\"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,\"\nsaid Nurse.\n\nThe minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting\nfor his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very\ngrave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with\nvelvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very\nexpensive jam tarts.\n\nThey bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: \"Sire, your\ngreat-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is\ndead, and now you have got to come and be King.\"\n\n\"Yes, please, sir,\" said Lionel, \"when does it begin?\"\n\n\"You will be crowned this afternoon,\" said the grave gentleman who was\nnot quite so grave-looking as the other.\n\n\"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be\nfetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace\ncollar?\" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.\n\n\"Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about\nchanging your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up.\"\n\nThe grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses,\nwhich was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No.\n7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.\n\nLionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:\n\"Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear.\nNo--there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, ducky,\" said Nurse. \"Be a good little King now, and say\n'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little\ngirls, and don't have more than two helps of anything.\"\n\nSo off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King\nany more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he\nhad never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he\nhad to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his\ntongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had\nbeen building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all\nfluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving\nhandkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers\neverywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches\nwere ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their\nringing he heard thousands of people shouting, \"Long live Lionel! Long\nlive our little King!\"\n\nHe was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes,\nbut he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would\nvery likely have bothered about it the whole time.\n\nAs they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the\nPrime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.\n\n\"I thought we were a Republic,\" said Lionel. \"I'm sure there hasn't been\na King for some time.\"\n\n\"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened\nwhen my grandfather was a little boy,\" said the Prime Minister, \"and\nsince then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so\nmuch a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from\nthose who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from\nthose who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be\npaid for by the people.\"\n\n\"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?\"\n\n\"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had\nhad all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a\nstrange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond\nof books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be\ntinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill.\"\n\nHere the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage\nstopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being\ncrowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time\nit was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and\nhad had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he\nwas quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery.\n\nNurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam\nand hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and\nblue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked.\n\nAfter tea Lionel said: \"I think I should like a book. Will you get me\none, Nurse?\"\n\n\"Bless the child,\" said Nurse. \"You don't suppose you've lost the use of\nyour legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books\nyourself.\"\n\nSo Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the\nChancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and\nwere beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming\nbothering for now--when Lionel cried out: \"Oh, what a worldful of books!\nAre they yours?\"\n\n\"They are yours, Your Majesty,\" answered the Chancellor. \"They were the\nproperty of the late King, your great-great--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Lionel interrupted. \"Well, I shall read them all. I love\nto read. I am so glad I learned to read.\"\n\n\"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,\" said the Prime Minister, \"I\nshould not read these books. Your great--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Lionel, quickly.\n\n\"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in his\nway, but he was a little--well, strange.\"\n\n\"Mad?\" asked Lionel, cheerfully.\n\n\"No, no\"--both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. \"Not mad; but if I\nmay express it so, he was--er--too clever by half. And I should not like\na little King of mine to have anything to do with his books.\"\n\nLionel looked puzzled.\n\n\"The fact is,\" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an\nagitated way, \"your great--\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Lionel.\n\n\"--was called a wizard.\"\n\n\"But he wasn't?\"\n\n\"Of course not--a most worthy King was your great--\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"But I wouldn't touch his books.\"\n\n\"Just this one,\" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great\nbrown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the\nbrown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists\nof them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too\nquickly.\n\n\"I must look at this one,\" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters\nhe read: _The Book of Beasts_.\n\nThe Chancellor said, \"Don't be a silly little King.\"\n\nBut Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page,\nand there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and\nblue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive.\n\n\"There,\" said Lionel, \"Isn't that lovely? Why--\"\n\nBut as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings\non the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window.\n\n\"Well!\" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump\nof wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, \"that's\nmagic, that is.\"\n\nBut before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there\nwas a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him.\nUnder him was written, \"Blue Bird of Paradise,\" and while the King gazed\nenchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on\nthe yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.\n\nThen the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it\nup on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high\nshelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:\n\"You're a naughty, disobedient little King!\" and was very angry indeed.\n\n\"I don't see that I've done any harm,\" said Lionel. He hated being\nshaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped.\n\n\"No harm?\" said the Chancellor. \"Ah--but what do you know about it?\nThat's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next\npage--a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or\nsomething like that.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,\" said Lionel. \"Come, let's kiss and\nbe friends.\" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for\na nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to\nadd up his accounts.\n\nBut when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book,\nand when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got\nup and crept down to the library and climbed up and got _The Book of\nBeasts_.\n\nHe took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as\nday, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with \"Butterfly\"\nand \"Blue Bird of Paradise\" underneath, and then he turned the next\npage. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and\nunder it was written \"Dragon.\" The Dragon did not move, and the King\nshut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed.\n\nBut the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into\nthe garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises,\nthe book opened all by itself at the picture with \"Dragon\" underneath,\nand the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great\nRed Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew\naway across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the\nempty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green\npalm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the\npaintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon.\n\nAnd then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King\ntwenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry\nhis faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to\nbuy him a crown, and everything!\n\nLionel began to cry.\n\n[\"The dragon flew away across the garden.\" _See page 8._]\n\nThe Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running\nto see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood,\nand the Chancellor said: \"You naughty little King! Put him to bed,\nNurse, and let him think over what he's done.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, my Lord,\" said the Prime Minister, \"we'd better first find out\njust exactly what he has done.\"\n\nThen Lionel, in floods of tears, said: \"It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone\nflying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!\"\n\nBut the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of\nthan forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see\nwhat could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees\nand stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in\nthe hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse,\nmeanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone\nelse, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and\nwhen it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by.\n\n\"You are a naughty little King,\" she said, \"and nobody will love you.\"\n\nNext day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's\nsubjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green\ntrees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne\nand said he wanted to make some laws.\n\nAnd I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor\nand the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private\njudgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he\ngot on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became\ninfallible--which means that everything he said was right, and that he\ncouldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: \"There is to be a law\nforbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere\"--he had the\nsupport of at least half of his subjects, and the other half--the\ngrown-up half--pretended to think he was quite right.\n\nThen he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And\nthis pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.\n\nAnd when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went\nhome and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:\n\"People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for\nthem.\"\n\nBut Nurse said: \"Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen\nthe last of that Dragon yet.\"\n\nNow, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly\nswooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off\nthe Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all.\n\nThen the people were very angry indeed, and they said: \"We might as well\nbe a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and\neverything!\"\n\nAnd wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National\nLove of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time\nafterward.\n\nLionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people\nwere beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book.\n\"After all,\" they said, \"soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is\nwise to discourage it.\"\n\nPopular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had\ndisagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place\nwhere they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard\nand tough.\n\nAll the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient\ntime, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the\nDragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up\nbecause it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and\nafterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new\nParliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as\nunpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so\nthey had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around\neveryone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that\nday and only ate an Orphanage.\n\nLionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that\nhad brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the\nSoccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do\nsomething. The question was, what?\n\nThe Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in\nthe Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch\non his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that\nall the creatures in _The Book of Beasts_ could not be wicked, like the\nDragon, and he thought: \"Suppose I could get another beast out who would\nfight the Dragon?\"\n\nSo he took _The Book of Beasts_ out into the rose garden and opened the\npage next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see\nwhat the name was. He could only see \"cora,\" but he felt the middle of\nthe page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come\nout, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it\nsuddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened\nthe clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the\nChancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten\nwith the rest of the Parliament, and he said: \"What animal ends in\n'cora'?\"\n\nThe Chancellor answered: \"The Manticora, of course.\"\n\n\"What is he like?\" asked the King.\n\n\"He is the sworn foe of Dragons,\" said the Chancellor. \"He drinks their\nblood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I\nwish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of\nyears ago--worse luck!\"\n\nThen the King ran and opened the book at the page that had \"cora\" on it,\nand there was the picture--Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and\na man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture\nwas written, \"Manticora.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing\nits eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and\nwhen Lionel gave it a push and said, \"Go along and fight the Dragon,\ndo,\" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and\nhid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it\nwent around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed\nmore than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little\ntimid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for\ncalling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the\nmilk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it\nate the cans as well.\n\nAnd just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth,\nwhich was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset,\nthe Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged\noff when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting\nkind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took\nrefuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying\nto conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the\nManticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard\nall over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had\nseemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad\nsilence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the\nDragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting\nfire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments\nof the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However\npopular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do\nsomething on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty.\n\n[Illustration \"The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office.\"\n_See page 13._]\n\nThe Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except\nduring the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he\nwould have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very\nhot to begin with.\n\nAt last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal\nnursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King\ncried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to\nstop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the\nButterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: \"Nurse, wipe my\nface, please. I am not going to cry any more.\"\n\nNurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King.\n\"Crying,\" said she, \"never did anyone any good yet.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the little King, \"I seem to see better, and to hear\nbetter now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm\nright, so kiss me in case I never come back. I _must_ try to see if I\ncan't save the people.\"\n\n\"Well, if you must, you must,\" said Nurse, \"but don't tear your clothes\nor get your feet wet.\"\n\nSo off he went.\n\nThe Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more\nbrightly, as Lionel once more carried _The Book of Beasts_ out into the\nrose garden, and opened it--very quickly, so that he might not be afraid\nand change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and\nthere was written at the bottom of the page, \"Hippogriff,\" and before\nLionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of\ngreat wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly\nneighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a\nlong, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great\nwings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and\nhe stood there among the roses.\n\nThe Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the\nlittle King's shoulder, and the little King thought: \"But for the wings\nyou are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse.\" And the Blue Bird's\nsong was very loud and sweet.\n\nThen suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling,\nsprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he\nmust do. He caught up _The Book of Beasts_ and jumped on the back of the\ngentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the\nsharp, white ear: \"Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the\nPebbly Waste.\"\n\nAnd when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with\nhis great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's\nwide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise.\n\nWhen the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff\nand the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they\nsaw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began\nto think what they would wear for Court mourning.\n\nBut the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger\nthan the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the\nwhite-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon\npursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste.\n\nNow, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there\nis no sand--all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass\nthere and no tree within a hundred miles of it.\n\nLionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the\nPebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped _The Book of Beasts_ and laid\nit open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste\nto get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came\nthe Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for\na tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining\nlike a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a\nhundred miles.\n\nThe white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed\non the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even\nhad begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in\nanother minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with\nhis red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach\nthem, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he\nshould get any hotter.\n\nIt was then that he saw _The Book of Beasts_ lying on the pebbles, open\nat the page with \"Dragon\" written at the bottom. He looked and he\nhesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage,\nthe Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the\npalm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in.\n\nAs soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and\nsit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he\njumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang.\n\n\"Oh, hurrah!\" he cried. \"Now we really have done it.\"\n\nAnd he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.\n\n\"Oh, my precious Hippogriff,\" he cried. \"You are the bravest, dearest,\nmost beautiful--\"\n\n\"Hush,\" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. \"Don't you see that we are\nnot alone?\"\n\nAnd indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the\nPrime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the\nOrphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone\nwho had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the\nDragon to take them into the book with him--it was a tight fit even for\none Dragon--so, of course, he had to leave them outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after.\n\nWhen the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged\nto be allowed to go back into the book. \"I do not care for public life,\"\nhe said.\n\nOf course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of\nhis opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or\nanything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:\nThat is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except\nin a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because\nthere was no room for them in the book--and the milk cans too.\n\nThen the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the\nHippogriff's page of the book. \"I should like,\" he said, \"to live\nsomewhere where Dragons can't get at me.\"\n\nSo the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and\nthere he stayed till the King had him taken out for his\ngreat-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with.\n\nAs for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own\nRocking Horse--a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden\none. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the\nlilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day.\n\n[UNCLE JAMES OR THE PURPLE STRANGER]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger\n\n\nThe Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.\n\n\"What will you do when you grow up, Princess?\" asked the gardener's boy.\n\n\"I should like to marry you, Tom,\" said the Princess. \"Would you mind?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the gardener's boy. \"I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if\nyou like--if I have time.\"\n\nFor the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a\ngeneral and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil\nengineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and\ntip-top of the geography class.\n\nAs for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and\neveryone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle\nJames and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though\nshe was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her\nlessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons,\nyou may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate\naccident they really _are_ done. Then the Princess had a truly good\nheart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her\nhippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she\nnever forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the\nbackyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made\nher nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with\nher and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across\nher throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear.\n\nWhen the Princess had been good all through the week--for, like all\nreal, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never\nbad--Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on\nWednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end\nof the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little\ndukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice\npudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would\nsay: \"Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?\" just as\nif she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:\n\n\"Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea\npig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep.\"\n\nSo their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological\nGardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig,\nand where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some\ngrown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose.\n\nThere always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was\nkind--except one.\n\nNow that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the\nKingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a\nthoughtful child--as of course you are--you will not need me to tell you\nwhat was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a\nthoughtful child--and it is just possible of course that you are not--I\nwill tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. _All the\nanimals were the wrong sizes!_ And this was how it happened.\n\nIn old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and\nair and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning\naround like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their\nproper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away\nby itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get\nspread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth\nflew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long\npiece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy\nmixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran\nits point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other\nside of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big\nspinning top.\n\nI am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography is never quite\nlively, and after all, I must give you a little information even in a\nfairy tale--like the powder in jam.\n\nWell, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the\nshock was so great that it set them spinning together through the\nair--which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of\nthe things--only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around\nthey had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently\nCenter of Gravity--a great giant who was managing the whole\nbusiness--woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" he said. \"Come down and lie still, can't you?\"\n\nSo the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the\npoint of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea\nbottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay\nstill. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the\nKingdom of Rotundia.\n\nThis is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little\nnatural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our\ntime. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the\nwrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all\ngrew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our\nelephants, and the elephant--dear little pet--was the size of the silly,\ntiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The\nrabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild\nparts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway\ntunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures.\nI can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will\nnot help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was\nalways asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne\nwith him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of\na brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the\ndormouse was talking in his sleep.\n\nThe men and women and children in this wonderful island were quite the\nright size, because their ancestors had come over with the Conqueror\nlong after the island had settled down and the animals grown on it.\n\nNow the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending,\nyou know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people:\nthe Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle--who was a magician,\nand knew everything without learning it--and Tom, the gardener's son.\n\nTom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to\ntake a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a\n_History of Rotundia_, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the\nback. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom,\nthe gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize\nin the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to\ntake; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a\nPrincess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better.\n\nThe Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes\nand marquises did not come to tea--and when he told her he was almost\nsure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: \"Dear Tom, dear\ngood, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet\nelephant--and you can keep him till we're married.\"\n\nThe pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away\nin his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever\nsaw--about six inches long. But he was very, very wise--he could not\nhave been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in\nTom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk\naround Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's\nheart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the\nPrincess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would\nreceive the _History of Rotundia_, beautifully bound, with the Royal\narms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog\ndid bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia--the kingdom\ncould not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the\nkind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the\nend of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail--but in Rotundia he\nwas bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he\nbarked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left\nno room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at\nall. He never barked at things that went on in the island--he was too\nlarge-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark,\ntumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or\ntwice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about\nthere just as they liked.\n\nBut on this particular night he barked and barked and barked--and the\nPrincess said, \"Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy.\"\nAnd Tom said to himself, \"I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as\nit's light I'll go and see.\"\n\nSo when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and\nwent out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses\nshook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in\na cart whose horse is frisky.\n\n\"I'll go to the pillar,\" thought Tom, as he went through the town. The\npillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck\nitself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin\naround the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and\nstuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great\ndeal farther than when you were not.\n\nAs Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a\npretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning,\nfrisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did\nnot go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that\nsize is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might\neasily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very\nsorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to\nmake even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the\nway when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind\nhearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward.\n\nSo Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow\nmore and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the\ntime, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple\nfactory rocked again.\n\nBut when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb\nto the top to find out what the dog was barking at.\n\nFor there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were\nlike old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his\nhead was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his\ntail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and\ntight, like the lash of a carriage whip.\n\nIt was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and\nthen it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as\nthough it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of\npurple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor\none must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar.\n\nEveryone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the\ndragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched\nthem flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one\npersonally.\n\nSo now he said: \"I am afraid you don't feel quite well.\"\n\nThe dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all\nother animals, he could understand well enough when he liked.\n\n\"Can I get you anything?\" asked Tom, politely.\n\nThe dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.\n\n\"A bun or two, now,\" said Tom, coaxingly. \"There's a beautiful bun tree\nquite close.\"\n\nThe dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so\nTom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of\nfresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind,\nwhich grow on the low bushes near the pillar.\n\nBecause, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the\nwrong way is that all the things we have to make--buns and cakes and\nshortbread--grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make\ntheir cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just\nas our cooks make puddings and turnovers.\n\nTom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: \"Here, try to eat a little.\nYou'll soon feel better then.\"\n\nThe dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to\nlick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the\nnews, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the\nisland--a thing that had never happened before--that they all went out\nto look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief\nSchoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the _History\nof Rotundia_, in his pocket--the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms\non the cover--and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom\nnever got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it,\ndid not like it.\n\n\"Perhaps it's all for the best,\" said Tom. \"I might not have liked that\nprize either, if I had gotten it.\"\n\nIt happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked\nwhat they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls\nsaid, \"Let's go and see the dragon.\" But the little duchesses and\nmarchionesses and countesses said they were afraid.\n\nThen Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, \"Don't be silly,\nbecause it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things\nlike that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In\nRotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of,\nunless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's\nall go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops.\" So they\nwent. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon\nwith acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much\nof his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very,\nvery long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give\nan acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his\ntail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, \"Oh, you nice,\nkind, pretty little Princess.\" But deep down in his wicked purple heart\nhe was saying, \"Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like\nto eat you instead of these silly acid drops.\" But of course nobody\nheard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and\naccustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade.\n\nNow, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in\nRotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete\nBad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you\nknow from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the\n_Babes in the Wood_, or the _Norfolk Tragedy_, and one James at least\nwas bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone\nis a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you\nneed not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete\nBad--and he will come to no good.\n\nUncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the\nkingdom to himself. He did not like many things--a nice kingdom was\nalmost the only thing he cared for--but he had never seen his way quite\nclearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will\nnot work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a\nduck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance\nfor him--because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the\nisland who could stand by each other--himself and the dragon. He said\nnothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and\neveryone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance\nexcept Tom.\n\nTom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent\nlittle creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to\nthe table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had\ngiven Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant\npointed out a date--the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday,\nand looked anxiously at its master.\n\n\"What is it, Fido--good little elephant--then?\" said Tom, and the\nsagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood.\n\n\"Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the\nlookout.\" And he was.\n\n[\"By-and-by he began to wander.\" _See page 29._]\n\nAt first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who\nlived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he\nbegan to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great\nrabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long,\ntight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and\nbefore they had time to say, \"There he goes,\" his ugly purple head\nwould come poking out from another rabbit-hole--perhaps just behind\nthem--or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's\nlaugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at\nfirst, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't\nknow what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing\nblind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the\nhabit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on\npeople's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you\nknow how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public\nkingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were\nnothing much at first--a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two,\nand some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say,\nbut it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of\nthe Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then\ncame a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had\nbarked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown\nquite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke\neverybody up--and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the\nlapdog was gone!\n\nA boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the\narmy was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle\nJames came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a\nspeech. He said: \"Friends--fellow citizens--I cannot disguise from\nmyself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a\nhelpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a--is no end of a\ndragon.\"\n\nThe people thought of the dragon's tail and said, \"Hear, hear.\"\n\nUncle James went on: \"Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless\nmember of our community. We don't know what has happened.\"\n\nEveryone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned.\n\n\"The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,\" said Uncle James.\n\nEveryone thought of the poor army.\n\n\"There is only one thing to be done.\" Uncle James was warming to his\nsubject. \"Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple\nprecaution we lost more rabbits--or even, perhaps, our navy, our police,\nand our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect\nnothing, however sacred.\"\n\nEveryone thought of themselves--and they said, \"What is the simple\nprecaution?\"\n\nThen Uncle James said: \"Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is\naccustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present\nhe will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he\nwill fly off and never come back.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly--and the Princess from her balcony clapped her\nhands.\n\n\"The present the dragon expects,\" said Uncle James, cheerfully, \"is\nrather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a\ngrudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a\nPrincess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us\nto display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless\nthat costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess\nwill only show how generous you are.\"\n\nThe crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite\nsaw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon\nwhat it wanted.\n\nThe Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday\npresent--especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he\nwas so angry.\n\nHe went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant\ncheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a\ntop that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.\n\nEarly in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the\ndowns--there were hardly any rabbits playing there now--and then he\ngathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she\nwoke up and looked out.\n\n\"Come up and kiss me,\" she said.\n\nSo Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the\nwindow, and said: \"Many happy returns of the day.\"\n\nThen Mary Ann began to cry, and said: \"Oh, Tom--how can you? When you\nknow quite well--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't,\" said Tom. \"Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess--what do\nyou think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday\npresent? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged\neverything. You've only got to do as you are told.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" said the Princess. \"Oh--that's easy--I've often done\nthat!\"\n\nThen Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and\nagain. \"Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,\" she said. \"How glad I am that I\ngave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!\"\n\nThe next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest\nwith the gold snakes on it--he was a magician, and he had a bright taste\nin vests--and he called with a cab to take the Princess out.\n\n\"Come, little birthday present,\" he said tenderly. \"The dragon will be\nso pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child,\nwe cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others\nrather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be\nselfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon,\nfar from his home and friends.\"\n\nThe Princess said she would try not to be selfish.\n\nPresently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was the dragon, his\nugly purple head shining in the sun, and his ugly purple mouth half\nopen.\n\nUncle James said: \"Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small\npresent for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go\nby without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a\nstranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We\nhave but one Princess, but we give her freely--do we not, my child?\"\n\nThe Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon came a little nearer.\n\nSuddenly a voice cried: \"Run!\" and there was Tom, and he had brought the\nZoological guinea pig and a pair of Belgian hares with him. \"Just to see\nfair,\" said Tom.\n\nUncle James was furious. \"What do you mean, sir,\" he cried, \"by\nintruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go\naway, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else.\"\n\nBut while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one on each side of\nhim, their great sides towering ever so high, and now they pressed him\nbetween them so that he was buried in their thick fur and almost choked.\nThe Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar and was\npeeping around it to see what was going on. A crowd had followed the cab\nout of the town; now they reached the scene of the \"State Function\"--and\nthey all cried out: \"Fair play--play fair! We can't go back on our word\nlike this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the\npoor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present.\" And they tried\nto get at Tom--but the guinea pig stood in the way.\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom cried. \"Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall\nhave the Princess--if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann.\"\n\nMary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: \"Bo! you\ncan't catch me,\" and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the\ndragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped,\ndodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the\ndragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly\nas she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first\ntime she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and\nnearer--with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy\ntrying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end\nof his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the\ndragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar.\nIt was exactly like winding a top--only the peg was the pillar, and the\ndragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the\nBelgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything\nbut choke.\n\nWhen the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could\nbe, and as tight--like cotton on a reel--the Princess stopped running,\nand though she had very little breath left, she managed to say,\n\"Yah--who's won now?\"\n\nThis annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength--spread\nhis great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled\nhis tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail\n_had_ to come, and the pillar _had_ to come around with the tail, and\nthe island _had_ to come around with the pillar, and in another minute\nthe tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a\ntop. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on\ntight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen.\nAll but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and\nfelt nothing but fur and fury.\n\nAnd something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia\nspinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world,\nand as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea\npigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and\nchildren would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to\nhold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of\ncourse, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the\nbest of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got\nsmall the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet--a\nlittle, crawling, purple newt with wings.\n\n[\"The dragon ran after her.\" _See page 34._]\n\n\"Funny little thing,\" said the Princess, when she saw it. \"I will take\nit for a birthday present.\"\n\nBut while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to\nthemselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding\ntight--he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of\ngardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the\nother beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the\nPrincess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And\nthe dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present.\n\nSo now all the animals were new sizes--and at first it seemed very\nstrange to everyone to have great lumbering elephants and a tiny little\ndormouse, but they have gotten used to it now, and think no more of it\nthan we do.\n\nAll this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the\n_Rotundia Times_ an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord\nThomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone\nbut Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the\nwedding--and _K.C.D._, of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon.\nIf you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they\nspell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of\nthe bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the\nbridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You\nremember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were\nmarried. The _Rotundia Times_ called the married couple \"the happy\npair.\" It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that--it is\nsuch a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of\nthe things you see in papers.\n\nBecause, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of\neach other they could not help being happy--and besides, they had an\nelephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make\npeople happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know\nthere are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to\nsail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping\npeople, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not,\nwhich neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did.\n\n[THE DELIVERERS OF THEIR COUNTRY]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Deliverers of Their Country\n\n\nIt all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It hurt very\nmuch indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot spark--only it seemed\nto have legs as well, and wings like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried--not\nreal crying, but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being\nmiserable inside your mind--and then she went to her father to have the\nthing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a doctor, so of course he\nknew how to take things out of eyes--he did it very cleverly with a soft\npaintbrush dipped in castor oil.\n\nWhen he had gotten the thing out, he said: \"This is very curious.\" Effie\nhad often got things in her eye before, and her father had always seemed\nto think it was natural--rather tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still\nnatural. He had never before thought it curious.\n\nEffie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and said: \"I don't\nbelieve it's out.\" People always say this when they have had something\nin their eyes.\n\n\"Oh, yes--it's out,\" said the doctor. \"Here it is, on the brush. This is\nvery interesting.\"\n\nEffie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had\nany share in. She said: \"What?\"\n\nThe doctor carried the brush very carefully across the room, and held\nthe point of it under his microscope--then he twisted the brass screws\nof the microscope, and looked through the top with one eye.\n\n\"Dear me,\" he said. \"Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long\ncaudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the\n_Lacertidae_, yet there are traces of wings.\" The creature under his eye\nwriggled a little in the castor oil, and he went on: \"Yes; a batlike\nwing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and\nask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"You might give me sixpence, Daddy,\" said Effie, \"because I did bring\nyou the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye\n_does_ hurt.\"\n\nThe doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that he gave Effie a\nshilling, and presently the professor stepped round. He stayed to lunch,\nand he and the doctor quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the\nname and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye.\n\nBut at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother Harry fished\nsomething out of his tea, which he thought at first was an earwig. He\nwas just getting ready to drop it on the floor, and end its life in the\nusual way, when it shook itself in the spoon--spread two wet wings, and\nflopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself with its feet\nand stretching its wings, and Harry said: \"Why, it's a tiny newt!\"\n\nThe professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. \"I'll\ngive you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad,\" he said, speaking very\nfast; and then he picked it up carefully on his handkerchief.\n\n\"It is a new specimen,\" he said, \"and finer than yours, Doctor.\"\n\nIt was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long--with scales and wings.\n\nSo now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen, and they were\nboth very pleased. But before long these specimens began to seem less\nvaluable. For the next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the\ndoctor's boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the boot and the\nblacking, and screamed out that he was burnt.\n\nAnd from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big as a kitten, with\nlarge, shiny wings.\n\n\"Why,\" said Effie, \"I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St.\nGeorge killed.\"\n\nAnd Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten in the garden by a\ndragon about the size of a rabbit, which he had tried to chase, and the\nnext morning all the papers were full of the wonderful \"winged lizards\"\nthat were appearing all over the country. The papers would not call them\ndragons, because, of course, no one believes in dragons nowadays--and at\nany rate the papers were not going to be so silly as to believe in fairy\nstories. At first there were only a few, but in a week or two the\ncountry was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in the\nair you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm of bees. They all\nlooked alike except as to size. They were green with scales, and they\nhad four legs and a long tail and great wings like bats' wings, only the\nwings were a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on\nbicycles.\n\nThey breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons must, but still the\nnewspapers went on pretending they were lizards, until the editor of the\n_Standard_ was picked up and carried away by a very large one, and then\nthe other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them what they\nought not to believe. So when the largest elephant in the Zoo was\ncarried off by a dragon, the papers gave up pretending--and put ALARMING\nPLAGUE OF DRAGONS at the top of the paper.\n\n[\"The largest elephant in the zoo was carried off.\" _See\npage 43._]\n\nYou have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how\naggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but when\nonce you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because\nthey were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors\nall day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But the smaller\nsizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the\nsoap, and they got in the butter. The ones as big as dogs got in the\nbath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything\nwhen the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were\noften scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large as pigeons\nwould get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were\nin a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep\nwere easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they\nflew in at the windows and curled up under your eiderdown, and you did\nnot find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this\nsize did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the\nsheets and pillowcases dreadfully.\n\nOf course, the County Council and the police did everything that could\nbe done: It was no use offering the hand of the Princess to anyone who\nkilled a dragon. This way was all very well in olden times--when there\nwas only one dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more\ndragons than Princesses--although the Royal Family was a large one. And\nbesides, it would have been a mere waste of Princesses to offer rewards\nfor killing dragons, because everybody killed as many dragons as they\ncould quite out of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to\nget the nasty things out of the way. The County Council undertook to\ncremate all dragons delivered at their offices between the hours of ten\nand two, and whole wagonloads and cartloads and truckloads of dead\ndragons could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line in the\nstreet where the County Council had their offices. Boys brought\nbarrowloads of dead dragons, and children on their way home from morning\nschool would call in to leave the handful or two of little dragons they\nhad brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted pocket\nhandkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. Then\nthe police stuck up great wood and canvas towers covered with patent\nglue. When the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as\nflies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and when the\ntowers were covered all over with dragons, the police inspector used to\nset fire to the towers, and burnt them and dragons and all.\n\nAnd yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. The shops were full\nof patent dragon poison and anti-dragon soap, and dragonproof curtains\nfor the windows; and indeed, everything that could be done was done.\n\nAnd yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.\n\nIt was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon, because, you\nsee, they ate such different things. The largest kind ate elephants as\nlong as there were any, and then went on with horses and cows. Another\nsize ate nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only\nPrime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would feed freely\non servants in livery. Another size lived on bricks, and three of them\nate two thirds of the South Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon.\n\nBut the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining\nroom, and that size ate little girls and boys.\n\nAt first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in\ntheir lives. It was so amusing to sit up all night instead of going to\nsleep, and to play in the garden lighted by electric lamps. And it\nsounded so funny to hear Mother say, when they were going to bed: \"Good\nnight, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You\nmust not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty\ndragons to catch you.\"\n\nBut after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted to see the\nflowers and trees growing in the fields, and to see the pretty sunshine\nout of doors, and not just through glass windows and patent dragonproof\ncurtains. And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were not\nallowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden because of the\nnight-dew.\n\nAnd they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in the beautiful,\nbright, dangerous daylight, that they began to try and think of some\nreason why they ought to go out. Only they did not like to disobey their\nmother.\n\nBut one morning their mother was busy preparing some new dragon poison\nto lay down in the cellars, and their father was bandaging the hand of\nthe boot boy, which had been scratched by one of the dragons who liked\nto eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so nobody remembered to\nsay to the children: \"Don't get up till it is quite dark!\"\n\n\"Go now,\" said Harry. \"It would not be disobedient to go. And I know\nexactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it.\"\n\n\"What ought we to do?\" said Effie.\n\n\"We ought to wake St. George, of course,\" said Harry. \"He was the only\nperson in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the\nfairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only\nasleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St.\nGeorge now. I heard father say so.\"\n\n\"We do,\" said Effie.\n\n\"Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we\ncould wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can\nyou?\"\n\nEffie said no, but where could they find St. George?\n\n\"We must go and look,\" said Harry boldly. \"You shall wear a dragonproof\nfrock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over\nwith the best dragon poison, and--\"\n\nEffie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried: \"Oh, Harry! I\nknow where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course.\"\n\n\"Um,\" said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself, \"you have a\nlittle sense sometimes, for a girl.\"\n\nSo the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset\nannounced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the\ntwo children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of\ndragonproof muslin--there was no time to make the frock--and Harry made\na horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted\nharmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe.\n\nThen they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As\nyou know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they\ntook the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the\nbright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous.\n\nThere was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was\nsimply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the\nright size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might\nhave had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on\nthe roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings,\nand dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun.\nThe town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten\nout of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the\nfields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and\ntails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests\nin the flowering hawthorn hedges.\n\nEffie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon\nflopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green\ndragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the\nsky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew.\n\n\"Oh, I want to go home,\" said Effie.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" said Harry. \"Surely you haven't forgotten about the\nSeven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their\ncountry's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home.\"\n\n\"And are we,\" asked Effie--\"deliverers, I mean?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" said her brother, and on they went.\n\nWhen they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they\nwalked right in--but St. George was not there, so they walked around the\nchurchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St.\nGeorge, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor\nand helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast.\n\n\"How ever can we wake him?\" they said. Then Harry spoke to St.\nGeorge--but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not\nseem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great\ndragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no\nnotice.\n\nThen Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck\nas well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at\nthe back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: \"Oh, dear, good,\nkind St. George, please wake up and help us.\"\n\nAnd at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself\nand said: \"What's the matter, little girl?\"\n\nSo the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and\nleaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many\ndragons he shook his head.\n\n\"It's no good,\" he said, \"they would be one too many for poor old\nGeorge. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair\nfight--one man one dragon, was my motto.\"\n\nJust then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew\nhis sword.\n\nBut he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of\ndragons grew small in the distance.\n\n\"I can't do anything,\" he said. \"Things have changed since my time. St.\nAndrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike,\nand he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now;\nthere must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort\nof weather have you been having lately?\"\n\nThis seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but\nEffie said patiently, \"It has been very fine. Father says it is the\nhottest weather there has ever been in this country.\"\n\n\"Ah, I guessed as much,\" said the Champion, thoughtfully. \"Well, the\nonly thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the\nonly thing. If you could find the taps.\"\n\nSt. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.\n\n\"Good night, very sorry I can't help you,\" he said, yawning behind his\nmarble hand.\n\n\"Oh, but you can,\" cried Effie. \"Tell us--what taps?\"\n\n\"Oh, like in the bathroom,\" said St. George, still more sleepily. \"And\nthere's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going\non. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm\nsorry I can't--good night.\"\n\nAnd he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.\n\n\"We shall never find the taps,\" said Harry. \"I say, wouldn't it be awful\nif St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats\nchampions?\"\n\nEffie pulled off her dragonproof veil. \"We didn't meet any the size of\nthe dining room as we came along,\" she said. \"I daresay we shall be\nquite safe.\"\n\nSo she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as\nhe could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make\neverything quite safe for him.\n\n\"We might hide in the church till it is dark,\" he said, \"and then--\"\n\nBut at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and they saw that it was\na dragon exactly the size of the dining room at home.\n\nSo then they knew that all was lost. The dragon swooped down and caught\nthe two children in his claws; he caught Effie by her green silk sash,\nand Harry by the little point at the back of his Eton jacket--and then,\nspreading his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like a\nthird-class carriage when the brake is hard on.\n\n\"Oh, Harry,\" said Effie, \"I wonder when he will eat us!\" The dragon was\nflying across woods and fields with great flaps of his wings that\ncarried him a quarter of a mile at each flap.\n\n[\"He rose into the air, rattling like a third-class\ncarriage.\" _See page 50._]\n\nHarry and Effie could see the country below, hedges and rivers and\nchurches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than\nyou see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train.\n\nAnd still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air\nas they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never\nstopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily.\n\n\"He knows where he wants to go,\" said Harry. \"Oh, if he would only drop\nus before he gets there!\"\n\nBut the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at\nlast, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a\nrattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there\non his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath,\nbecause he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's\nsash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket.\n\nThen Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her birthday. It\nhad cost only sixpence to begin with, and she had had it a month, and it\nnever could sharpen anything but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed\nto make that knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving\nthe dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That knife\nwould never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though, and when Effie had\ntried for some time she saw that this was so and gave it up. But with\nher help Harry managed to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that\nthe dragon had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children\ncrept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It was much too\nnarrow for the dragon to get in also, so they stayed in there and waited\nto make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and\nbegin to think about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they\nmade faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them, but they ran\nfarther into the cave so that he could not reach them, and when he was\ntired of blowing he went away.\n\nBut they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they went farther in,\nand presently the cave opened out and grew bigger, and the floor was\nsoft sand, and when they had come to the very end of the cave there was\na door, and on it was written: UNIVERSAL TAPROOM. PRIVATE. NO ONE\nALLOWED INSIDE.\n\nSo they opened the door at once just to peep in, and then they\nremembered what St. George had said.\n\n\"We can't be worse off than we are,\" said Harry, \"with a dragon waiting\nfor us outside. Let's go in.\"\n\nThey went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door behind them.\n\nAnd now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid rock, and all\nalong one side of the room were taps, and all the taps were labeled with\nchina labels like you see in baths. And as they could both read words of\ntwo syllables or even three sometimes, they understood at once that they\nhad gotten to the place where the weather is turned on from. There were\nsix big taps labeled \"Sunshine,\" \"Wind,\" \"Rain,\" \"Snow,\" \"Hail,\" \"Ice,\"\nand a lot of little ones, labeled \"Fair to moderate,\" \"Showery,\" \"South\nbreeze,\" \"Nice growing weather for the crops,\" \"Skating,\" \"Good open\nweather,\" \"South wind,\" \"East wind,\" and so on. And the big tap labeled\n\"Sunshine\" was turned full on. They could not see any sunshine--the cave\nwas lighted by a skylight of blue glass--so they supposed the sunlight\nwas pouring out by some other way, as it does with the tap that washes\nout the underneath parts of patent sinks in kitchens.\n\nThen they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass,\nand when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in\nthe world--and all at once, too, which is not like most looking glasses.\nThey saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County Council\noffices, and they saw St. George asleep under the dragonproof veil. And\nthey saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out\nin the dreadful, dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had\neaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a great puzzle\nmap--green in the field parts and brown in the towns, and black in the\nplaces where they make coal and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All\nover it, on the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there\nwas a network of green dragons. And they could see that it was still\nbroad daylight, and no dragons had gone to bed yet.\n\nEffie said, \"Dragons do not like cold.\" And she tried to turn off the\nsunshine, but the tap was out of order, and that was why there had been\nso much hot weather, and why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So\nthey left the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and left\nthe tap full on while they went to look in the glass. There they saw the\ndragons running all sorts of ways like ants if you are cruel enough to\npour water into an ant-heap, which, of course, you never are. And the\nsnow fell more and more.\n\nThen Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently the dragons\nbegan to wriggle less, and by-and-by some of them lay quite still, so\nthe children knew the water had put out the fires inside them, and they\nwere dead. So then they turned on the hail--only half on, for fear of\nbreaking people's windows--and after a while there were no more dragons\nto be seen moving.\n\nThen the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers of their\ncountry.\n\n\"They will put up a monument to us,\" said Harry, \"as high as Nelson's!\nAll the dragons are dead.\"\n\n\"I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!\" said Effie.\n\"And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with\nsuch a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them,\nand they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the\nrain would wash them off into the sea.\"\n\nBut this did not happen, and the children began to feel that they had\nnot been so frightfully clever after all.\n\n\"I wonder what this old thing's for,\" said Harry. He had found a rusty\nold tap, which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. Its china\nlabel was quite coated over with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had\ncleaned it with a bit of her skirt--for curiously enough both the\nchildren had come out without pocket handkerchiefs--she found that the\nlabel said \"Waste.\"\n\n\"Let's turn it on,\" she said. \"It might carry off the dragons.\"\n\nThe tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time,\nbut together they managed to turn it on, and then ran to the mirror to\nsee what happened.\n\nAlready a great, round black hole had opened in the very middle of the\nmap of England, and the sides of the map were tilting themselves up, so\nthat the rain ran down toward the hole.\n\n\"Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!\" cried Effie, and she hurried back to the\ntaps and turned on everything that seemed wet. \"Showery,\" \"Good open\nweather,\" \"Nice growing weather for the crops,\" and even \"South\" and\n\"South-West,\" because she had heard her father say that those winds\nbrought rain.\n\nAnd now the floods of rain were pouring down on the country, and great\nsheets of water flowed toward the center of the map, and cataracts of\nwater poured into the great round hole in the middle of the map, and the\ndragons were being washed away and disappearing down the waste pipe in\ngreat green masses and scattered green shoals--single dragons and\ndragons by the dozen; of all sizes, from the ones that carry off\nelephants down to the ones that get in your tea.\n\nPresently there was not a dragon left. So then they turned off the tap\nnamed \"Waste,\" and they half-turned off the one labeled \"Sunshine\"--it\nwas broken, so that they could not turn it off altogether--and they\nturned on \"Fair to moderate\" and \"Showery\" and both taps stuck, so that\nthey could not be turned off, which accounts for our climate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.\n\nAnd was the nation grateful? Well--the nation was very wet. And by the\ntime the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new\ninvention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were\nalmost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead\nand gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered.\n\nAnd what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?\n\nMy dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will\nask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you.\n\nMother said: \"Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe--you're safe!\nYou naughty children--how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at\nonce!\"\n\nAnd their father the doctor said: \"I wish I had known what you were\ngoing to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away\nthe one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect\nspecimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the\nspecies.\"\n\nThe professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his\nspecimen--the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown\nfor--and he has it to this day.\n\nYou must get him to show it to you!\n\n\n\n\n[THE ICE DRAGON]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told\n\n\nThis is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the\neleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You\nmay think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly\nhappen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which\neven you do not know, and they did not know them either.\n\nTheir names were George and Jane.\n\nThere were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir\nto the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is\na very anxious time for any person--even for a Royal one. He was really\nvery poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible\ntaste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill,\nwhich was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite\nout of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is,\nfelt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels.\n\nBut when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only\nadmissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed\nfirework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty,\nand to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and\ntorchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with\n\"Blessings on our Prince\" and \"Long Live our Royal Darling\" in\ndifferent-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a\nhalf holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence\neach given them to spend as they liked.\n\nGeorge and Jane had sixpence each--and they spent the whole amount on a\ngolden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did\nlight went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in\nthe gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were\nvery glorious indeed.\n\nAll their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were\nallowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane\nhad put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the\nsilver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George\nhad his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's\nsealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears.\n\nIt was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very\ngay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they\nwere enjoying themselves.\n\nThey got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and\nthen they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a\nshining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they\nwere the spears carried by a fairy army.\n\n\"Oh, how pretty,\" said Jane. \"I wonder what they are. It looks as if the\nfairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them\nwith liquid light.\"\n\n\"Liquid fiddlestick!\" said George. He had been to school, so he knew\nthat these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he\nsaid so.\n\n\"But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?\" asked Jane. \"Who lights it,\nand what's it there for?\"\n\nGeorge had to own that he had not learned that.\n\n\"But I know,\" said he, \"that it has something to do with the Great Bear,\nand the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a\njolly rocket,\" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost\nunderstood about the star families.\n\nThe fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier\nthan the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and\nspluttering in the next-door-but-one garden--prettier even than the\ncolored fires at the Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I wish we could see them nearer,\" Jane said. \"I wonder if the star\nfamilies are nice families--the kind that Mother would like us to go to\ntea with, if we were little stars?\"\n\n\"They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,\" said her brother,\nkindly trying to explain. \"I only said 'families' because a kid like you\nwouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've\nforgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky,\nso you can't go to tea with them.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jane. \"I said if we were little stars.\"\n\n\"But we aren't,\" said George.\n\n\"No,\" said Jane, with a sigh. \"I know that. I'm not so stupid as you\nthink, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't\nwe go and see them?\"\n\n\"Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense.\" George kicked his\nboots against the fencing to warm his toes. \"It's half the world away.\"\n\n\"It looks very near,\" said Jane, hunching up her shoulders to keep her\nneck warm.\n\n\"They're close to the North Pole,\" said George. \"Look here--I don't care\na straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the\nNorth Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home\nand write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how\nbrave you are.\"\n\nJane got off the fence.\n\n\"Oh, George, _let's_,\" she said. \"We shall never have such a chance\nagain--all alone by ourselves--and quite late, too.\"\n\n\"I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you,\" George answered gloomily,\n\"but you know they always say I lead you into mischief--and if we went\nto the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and\nyou remember what they said about not going on the grass.\"\n\n\"They said the _lawn_,\" said Jane. \"We're not going on the _lawn_. Oh,\nGeorge, do, do let's. It doesn't look so _very_ far--we could be back\nbefore they had time to get dreadfully angry.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said George, \"but mind, I don't want to go.\"\n\nSo off they went. They got over the fence, which was very cold and white\nand shiny because it was beginning to freeze, and on the other side of\nthe fence was somebody else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly\nas they could, and beyond that was a field where there was another big\nbonfire, with people standing around it who looked quite dark-skinned.\n\n\"It's like Indians,\" said George, and wanted to stop and look, but Jane\npulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire and got through a gap in\nthe hedge into another field--a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a\nnumber of other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled and\ntwinkled.\n\nNow, during the winter the Arctic regions come much farther south than\nthey are marked on the map. Very few people know this, though you would\nthink they could tell it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just\nwhen George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the Arctic\nregions had come down very nearly as far as Forest Hill, so that, as the\nchildren walked on, it grew colder and colder, and presently they saw\nthat the fields were covered with snow, and there were great icicles\nhanging from all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still\nseemed some way off.\n\nThey were crossing a very rough, snowy field when Jane first noticed the\nanimals. There were white rabbits and white hares and all sorts and\nsizes of white birds, and some larger creatures in the shadows of the\nhedges that Jane was sure were wolves and bears.\n\n\"Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean,\" she said, for she did\nnot want George to think her stupid again.\n\nThere was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered with snow\nand icicles; but the children found a place where there was a hole, and\nas no bears or wolves seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they\ncrept through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the other side.\nAnd then they stood still and held their breath with wonder.\n\nFor in front of them, running straight and smooth right away to the\nNorthern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure dark ice, and on each\nside were tall trees all sparkling with white frost, and from the boughs\nof the trees hung strings of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and\nshining so brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane\nsaid so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the Earl's\nCourt Exhibition.\n\nThe rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away--away and\naway--and at the other end of them shone the Aurora Borealis.\n\nThere was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters of pure ice\nthe children read: THIS WAY TO THE NORTH POLE.\n\nThen George said: \"Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one--so here\ngoes.\" And he took a run on the frozen snow, and Jane took a run when\nshe saw him do it, and the next moment they were sliding away, each with\nfeet half a yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North\nPole.\n\nThis great slide is made for the convenience of the Polar bears, who,\nduring the winter months, get their food from the Army and Navy\nStores--and it is the most perfect slide in the world. If you have never\ncome across it, it is because you have never let off fireworks on the\neleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly naughty and\ndisobedient. But do not be these things in the hope of finding the great\nslide--because you might find something quite different, and then you\nwill be sorry.\n\nThe great slide is like common slides in that when once you have started\nyou have to go on to the end--unless you fall down--and then it hurts\njust as much as the smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs\ndownhill all the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and\nfaster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not time to notice\nthe scenery. They only saw the long lines of frosted trees and the\nstarry lamps, and on each side, rushing back as they slid on, a very\nbroad, white world and a very large, black night; and overhead as well\nas in the trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead\nshone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears. Jane said\nthat, and George said: \"I can see the Northern Lights quite plain.\"\n\nIt is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear, dark\nice--especially if you feel you are really going somewhere, and more\nespecially if that somewhere is the North Pole. The children's feet made\nno noise on the ice, and they went on and on in a beautiful white\nsilence. But suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out over\nthe snow.\n\n\"Hey! You there! Stop!\"\n\n\"Tumble for your life!\" cried George, and he fell down at once, because\nit is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top of him--and then they\ncrawled on hands and knees to the snow at the edge of the slide--and\nthere was a sportsman, dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache,\nlike the one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a gun\nin his hand.\n\n\"You don't happen to have any bullets about you?\" said he.\n\n\"No,\" George said, truthfully. \"I had five of father's revolver\ncartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets\nto see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said the sportsman, \"these accidents will occur. You don't\ncarry firearms, then, I presume?\"\n\n\"I haven't any fire_arms_,\" said George, \"but I have a fire_work_. It's\nonly a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good.\" And he began\nto feel among the string and peppermints, and buttons and tops and nibs\nand chalk and foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets.\n\n\"One could but try,\" the sportsman replied, and he held out his hand.\n\nBut Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered, \"Ask him\nwhat he wants it for.\"\n\nSo then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted the firework to kill\nthe white grouse with; and, when they came to look, there was the white\ngrouse himself, sitting in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn,\nand waiting anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the other.\n\nGeorge put all the things back in his pockets, and said, \"No, I shan't.\nThe reason for shooting him stopped yesterday--I heard Father say so--so\nit wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't--so there!\"\n\nThe sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at Jane, and then he\ngot on the slide and tried to go toward the Crystal Palace--which was\nnot easy, because that way is uphill. So they left him trying, and went\non.\n\nBefore they started, the white grouse thanked them in a few pleasant,\nwell-chosen words, and then they took a sideways slanting run and\nstarted off again on the great slide, and so away toward the North Pole\nand the twinkling, beautiful lights.\n\nThe great slide went on and on, and the lights did not seem to come much\nnearer, and the white silence wrapped around them as they slid along the\nwide, icy path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by\nsomeone calling: \"Hey! You there! Stop!\"\n\n\"Tumble for your life!\" cried George, and tumbled as before, stopping in\nthe only possible way, and Jane stopped on top of him, and they crawled\nto the edge and came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking\nfor specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net and a blue book\nwith colored plates.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the collector, \"but have you such a thing as a needle\nabout you--a very long needle?\"\n\n\"I have a needle _book_,\" replied Jane, politely, \"but there aren't any\nneedles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of\ncork--in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young\nMechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles.\"\n\n\"Curiously enough,\" said the collector, \"I too wish to use the needle in\nconnection with cork.\"\n\n\"I have a hatpin in my hood,\" said Jane. \"I fastened the fur with it\nwhen it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and\nsharp--would that do?\"\n\n\"One could but try,\" said the collector, and Jane began to feel for the\npin. But George pinched her arm and whispered, \"Ask what he wants it\nfor.\" Then the collector had to own that he wanted the pin to stick\nthrough the great Arctic moth, \"a magnificent specimen,\" he added,\n\"which I am most anxious to preserve.\"\n\nAnd there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net sat the great\nArctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation.\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't!\" cried Jane. And while George was explaining to the\ncollector that they would really rather not, Jane opened the blue folds\nof the butterfly net, and asked the moth quietly if it would please step\noutside for a moment. And it did.\n\nWhen the collector saw that the moth was free, he seemed less angry than\ngrieved.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I\nshall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of\nwriting to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly\nthoughtless little girl.\"\n\nSo they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill towards the\nCrystal Palace.\n\nWhen the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks in a suitable\nspeech, George and Jane took a sideways slanting run and started sliding\nagain, between the star-lamps along the great slide toward the North\nPole. They went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter\nand brighter--so that they could not keep their eyes open, but had to\nblink and wink as they went--and then suddenly the great slide ended in\nan immense heap of snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because\nthey could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that they went\nin up to their very ears.\n\nWhen they had picked themselves out and thumped each other on the back\nto get rid of the snow, they shaded their eyes and looked, and there,\nright in front of them, was the wonder of wonders--the North\nPole--towering high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse,\nand it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your head as far\nback as it would go, and farther, before you could see the high top of\nit. It was made entirely of ice. You will hear grown-up people talk a\ngreat deal of nonsense about the North Pole, and when you are grown up,\nit is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it yourself (the\nmost unlikely things do happen) but deep down in your heart you must\nalways remember that the North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not\npossibly, if you come to think of it, be made of anything else.\n\nAll around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were hundreds of\nlittle fires, and the flames of them did not flicker and twist, but went\nup blue and green and rosy and straight like the stalks of dream lilies.\n\nJane said so, but George said they were as straight as ramrods.\n\nAnd these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the children had seen\nas far away as Forest Hill.\n\nThe ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth, hard snow, which\nshone and sparkled like the top of a birthday cake that has been iced at\nhome. The ones done at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they\nmix flour with the icing sugar.\n\n\"It is like a dream,\" said Jane.\n\nAnd George said, \"It _is_ the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people\nalways make about getting here--and it was no trouble at all, really.\"\n\n\"I daresay lots of people have gotten here,\" said Jane, dismally. \"It's\nnot the getting _here_--I see that--it's the getting back again.\nPerhaps no one will ever know that _we_ have been here, and the robins\nwill cover us with leaves and--\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said George. \"There aren't any robins, and there aren't any\nleaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now\nI shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top--my\nhandkerchief will do; and if it really _is_ the North Pole, my pocket\ncompass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I\nshall know. Come on.\"\n\nSo Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear, tall, beautiful\nflames they saw that there was a great, queer-shaped lump of ice all\naround the bottom of the Pole--clear, smooth, shining ice, that was\ndeep, beautiful Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and\nall sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors in the thin\nparts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's house in London.\n\n\"It is a very curious shape,\" said Jane. \"It's almost like\"--she moved\nback a step to get a better view of it--\"it's almost like a dragon.\"\n\n\"It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment,\" said\nGeorge, who had noticed a curly thing like a tail that went twisting up\nthe North Pole.\n\n\"Oh, George,\" cried Jane, \"it _is_ a dragon; I can see its wings.\nWhatever shall we do?\"\n\nAnd, sure enough, it _was_ a dragon--a great, shining, winged, scaly,\nclawy, big-mouthed dragon--made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep\ncurled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the\nmiddle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column\nof steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have\ngot frozen in his sleep--frozen too hard to move--and there he stayed.\nAnd though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.\n\nJane said so, but George said, \"Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to\nget onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute.\"\n\n[\"Sure enough, it was a dragon.\" _See page 68._]\n\nThe dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian\nblueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the\ncold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made\nof one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from\nsheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the\ngreat white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an\nenormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the\nstalks of tall lilies.\n\nAnd as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight\ntheir eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a\nhurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the\nflame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping,\nscrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even\nwalking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires\nand danced around in a ring.\n\n\"It's bears,\" said Jane. \"I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come;\nand my boots are so wet.\"\n\nThe dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of\nfurry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the\nmiddle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur\ndresses, and the white silence was quite gone.\n\n\"Bears, indeed,\" cried a shrill voice. \"You'll wish we were bears before\nyou've done with us.\"\n\nThis sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children\nhad only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began\nto be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference\nbetween \"lawn\" and \"grass\" did not seem so great as it had at Forest\nHill.\n\nDirectly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one\ncries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So\nthat these people had never seen anyone cry before.\n\n\"Don't cry for real,\" whispered George, \"or you'll get chilblains in\nyour eyes. But pretend to howl--it frightens them.\"\n\nSo Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It\nalways does when you begin to pretend. You try it.\n\nThen, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane,\nGeorge said: \"Yah--who's afraid? We are George and Jane--who are you?\"\n\n\"We are the sealskin dwarfs,\" said the brown people, twisting their\nfurry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in\nkaleidoscopes. \"We are very precious and expensive, for we are made,\nthroughout, of the very best sealskin.\"\n\n\"And what are those fires for?\" bellowed George--for Jane was crying\nlouder and louder.\n\n\"Those,\" shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, \"are the fires we\nmake to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now--so he sleeps curled up around\nthe Pole--but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and\ngo and eat everybody in the world except us.\"\n\n\"WHATEVER--DO--YOU--WANT--HIM--TO--DO--THAT--FOR?\" yelled George.\n\n\"Oh--just for spite,\" bawled the dwarfs carelessly--as if they were\nsaying, \"Just for fun.\"\n\nJane stopped crying to say: \"You are heartless.\"\n\n\"No, we aren't,\" they said. \"Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin,\njust like little fat sealskin purses--\"\n\nAnd they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their\nbodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads\nwere like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their\nhands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were\nlike seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin.\n\n\"Thank you so much for telling us,\" said George. \"Good evening. (Keep on\nhowling, Jane!)\"\n\nBut the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the\nmuttering stopped--and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid\nto howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white\nsilence better.\n\nThen the chief dwarf came quite close and said: \"What's that on your\nhead?\"\n\nAnd George felt it was all up--for he knew it was his father's sealskin\ncap.\n\nThe dwarf did not wait for an answer. \"It's made of one of us,\" he\nscreamed, \"or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your\nfate is sealed!\"\n\nLooking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt\nthat their fate was sealed indeed.\n\nThe dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but\nit is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were\ngetting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the\nchildren down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole.\nYou have no idea how cold it was--the kind of cold that makes you feel\nsmall and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty\ntimes as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of.\n\nThe sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they\nhad no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong\nwhen they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very\nclose and said: \"Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he\nwill wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he\nwill begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you.\"\n\nThe little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of\ndream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and\ncolder.\n\n\"We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one\ncomfort,\" said George. \"We shall be turned into ice long before that.\"\n\nSuddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on\nthe dragon's head and said: \"Can I be of any assistance?\"\n\n[\"The dwarfs seized the children.\" _See page 72._]\n\nNow, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very\ncold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say\nnothing else. So the white grouse said: \"One moment. I am only too\ngrateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct\nabout the firework!\"\n\nAnd the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings\noverhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and\nthousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane\nlike snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above\nanother, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that\npresently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and\nonly their faces peeped out.\n\n\"Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse,\" said Jane, \"but you'll be cold\nyourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear\nfeathers?\"\n\nThe white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind,\nsoft bird voices.\n\n\"Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are\nhundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little\ntuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts\nwarm!\"\n\nThus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners.\n\nSo now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when\nthe sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his\nfriends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the\ndwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk.\n\nThe dragon had not moved yet--but then he might at any moment get warm\nenough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not\ncomfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the\ngrouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:\n\"You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you.\nWhat more can you possibly want?\"\n\nJust then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer\nthan the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: \"Oh, _do_\nmind your wings in the fires!\"\n\nFor they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail.\n\nSo they told him.\n\n\"Sealskin, are they?\" said the moth. \"Just you wait a minute!\"\n\nHe flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came\nback, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live\nsheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and\nthe stars.\n\nAnd then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.\n\nFor the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls,\nand it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a\nlive, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the\nsealskin fur.\n\nGrown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children\nwho eat fur--but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When\nthey are not thinking about you they say, \"I fear the moths have got at\nmy ermine tippet,\" or, \"Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak,\nbut it was eaten by moths.\" And now there were more moths than have ever\nbeen together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs.\n\nThe dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they\ncalled for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap\nand borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but\nlong before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The\nmoths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin\nthroughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the\nvery life--and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their\nend. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat\nbare pelts.\n\n\"Oh, thank you--thank you, darling Arctic moth,\" cried Jane. \"You are\ngood--I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you\nafterward!\"\n\nMillions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings,\n\"We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves\nonce in a while--to oblige a friend.\"\n\nAnd off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the\nsealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and\nJane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Jane, \"this is the worst of all!\"\n\n\"We've no friends left to help us,\" said George. He never thought that\nthe dragon himself might help them--but then that was an idea that would\nnever have occurred to any boy.\n\nIt grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers\nthe children shivered.\n\nThen, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder\nwithout breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon\nuncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy\nlength over the snow, and said: \"This is something like! How faint those\nfires did make me feel!\"\n\nThe fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The\ndragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all\nthrough, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die.\n\nBut when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He\nlooked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and\nJane, because they were frozen to his back.\n\nHe moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the\nPole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling\nsouth--with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of\ncourse the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you\nget to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled\nand tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you\ntouch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a\nmillion ways of going south from the North Pole--so you will own that it\nwas lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and\nsuddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed,\nbetween the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace.\n\n\"He's going to take us home,\" said Jane. \"Oh, he is a good dragon. I\n_am_ glad!\"\n\nGeorge was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all\nsure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were\nbringing a strange dragon home with them.\n\nThey went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down.\nYou would not understand why if I told you--because you are only in long\ndivision at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can\nshow off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their\ntails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do\nthat everything else is easy.\n\nThe dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the\nsportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide--vainly, because\nthey had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension.\n\nWhen the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly\nacross the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next\nto the next-door garden at Forest Hill.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped\naltogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as\nthat, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and\nmelt and melt--and before the children knew what he was doing they found\nthemselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet\nas wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!\n\nSo they went indoors.\n\nOf course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of\nGeorge and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting\ndown in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately.\n\nIt was long past their time, anyhow.\n\nNow, if you are of an inquiring mind--not at all a nice thing in a\nlittle child who reads fairy tales--you will want to know how it is that\nsince the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been\nlet out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as\never.\n\nMy dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some\nthings I know nothing about--and this is one of them. But I do know that\nwhoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin\ndwarfs. They were all eaten by moths--and motheaten things are of no\nuse, even to light fires!\n\n\n\n\n[THE ISLAND OF THE NINE WHIRLPOOLS]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools\n\n\nThe dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a\nblack-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping\ncarefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked,\nflat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it\nis not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for\ncats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put\ntheir tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were\ntoo.\n\nNow, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a\nKing he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his\nprofession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens\nwant children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the\nQueen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was\nvery frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a\nfire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron.\n\n\"What do you want, my dear?\" she said to the Queen.\n\n\"Oh, if you please,\" said the Queen, \"I want a baby--a very nice one. We\ndon't want any expense spared. My husband said--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the witch. \"I know all about him. And so you want a\nchild? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?\"\n\n\"It will bring me joy first,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"Great sorrow,\" said the witch.\n\n\"Greater joy,\" said the Queen.\n\nThen the witch said, \"Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as\nyour place is worth to go back without it?\"\n\n\"The King would be very much annoyed,\" said the poor Queen.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the witch. \"What will you give me for the child?\"\n\n\"Anything you ask for, and all I have,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"Then give me your gold crown.\"\n\nThe Queen took it off quickly.\n\n\"And your necklace of blue sapphires.\"\n\nThe Queen unfastened it.\n\n\"And your pearl bracelets.\"\n\nThe Queen unclasped them.\n\n\"And your ruby clasps.\"\n\nAnd the Queen undid the clasps.\n\n\"Now the lilies from your breast.\"\n\nThe Queen gathered together the lilies.\n\n\"And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles.\"\n\nThe Queen pulled off her shoes.\n\nThen the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by\none, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl\nbracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe\nbuckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies.\n\nThe stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and\nblue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and\npresently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the\ndoorway among the snakes.\n\nThen she said to the Queen: \"Your child will have hair as golden as your\ncrown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie\non its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its\nsoul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be\nno clearer than its wits.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" said the Queen, \"and when will it come?\"\n\n\"You will find it when you get home.\"\n\n\"And won't you have something for yourself?\" asked the Queen. \"Any\nlittle thing you fancy--would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?\"\n\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said the witch. \"I could make more diamonds in a\nday than I should wear in a year.\"\n\n\"Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,\" the Queen went on.\n\"Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or\na Princess, or something like that?\"\n\n\"There is one thing I should rather like,\" said the witch, \"but it's\nhard to get in my trade.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell me what,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"I should like some one to love me,\" said the witch.\n\nThen the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her\nhalf a hundred times. \"Why,\" she said, \"I love you better than my life!\nYou've given me the baby--and the baby shall love you too.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will,\" said the witch, \"and when the sorrow comes, send for\nme. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now,\ndrink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home.\"\n\nSo the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this\ntime, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved\nlike good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a\ncurtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are\nhanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was\nfriends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to\nbe civil.\n\nWhen the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the\ncradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as\npossible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at\nonce it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with\nfury.\n\n\"Oh, you silly, silly Queen!\" he said. \"Why didn't I marry a clever\nlady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you\nto a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted--a\nboy, an heir, a Prince--to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and\nto rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown--my crown,\" he said, \"you\nnever even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?\"\n\nAnd the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked\nfor a child.\n\n\"Very well, madam,\" said the King, \"very well--have your own way. And\nmake the most of your daughter, while she is a child.\"\n\nThe Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much\nhappiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little\nbaby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more\nclever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the\nPrincess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived.\n\nThe Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard\nfountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when\nthe King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his\nblack raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as\nindeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with\npretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin\nand tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he\nwas in the same temper as his master.\n\n\"A girl indeed!\" said the King angrily. \"I wonder you can dare to look\nme in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled\neverything.\"\n\n\"You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,\" said the Princess. She\nwas eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she\nwas a grown-up, so she spoke out.\n\nThe King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.\nBut the Queen said, \"My dear child, don't interfere,\" quite crossly, for\nshe was frightened.\n\nAnd to her husband she said, \"My dear, why do you go on worrying about\nit? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true--but she may marry a clever\nman who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as\never you cared to teach him.\"\n\nThen the King found his tongue.\n\n\"If she does marry,\" he said, slowly, \"her husband will have to be a\nvery clever man--oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a\nvery great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him.\"\n\nThe Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be\ndisagreeable.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"don't punish the child because she loves her mother.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to punish her for that,\" said he. \"I'm only going to\nteach her to respect her father.\"\n\nAnd without another word he went off to his laboratory and worked all\nnight, boiling different-colored things in crucibles, and copying charms\nin curious twisted letters from old brown books with mold stains on\ntheir yellowy pages.\n\nThe next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the\nLone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from\neverywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her.\nHe engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable\ngriffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: \"Here\nyou shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes\nto marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the\nNine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and\nthe griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No\ndoubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your\nwedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child.\"\n\nAnd his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very\nfast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left,\nwith the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools.\n\nThe Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she\nremembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the\nQueen told her all.\n\n\"For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me,\" said the\nwitch, \"I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is\nnot much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her.\nBut, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till\nthe spell is taken off the child.\"\n\n\"I would be a stone for a thousand years,\" said the poor Queen, \"if at\nthe end of them I could see my dear again.\"\n\nSo the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which\ntravel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker\nthan thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of\nthe Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in\nthe best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and\nthe dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her.\n\n\"Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,\" she cried, and hung around the Queen's\nneck as if she would never let go.\n\n\"Now,\" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for\nthem, \"I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not\nmake the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer\ncomes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the\ntower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I\nsay the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if\never we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a\nhappy old woman.\"\n\nThen the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said\nthe spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One\nof them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand;\nbut the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin\nand the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good\neducation.\n\nAnd now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day\nalways seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and\nkiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and\nsome one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the\nworld; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the\ngriffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time,\nfrom the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming,\ncreeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except\nthe Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and\nin hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in\ntriumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl,\nbearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her\ndowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who\nhad come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken\ntheir wise young heads and said: \"'Bout ship!\" and gone discreetly home\nto their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms.\n\nBut no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the\nyears went by.\n\nNow, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your\nslate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who\nwas a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and\nkeep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as\nyou would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince.\n\nNow there is Something which is wiser than all the world--and it knows\nwhen people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the\nfarther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear.\n\nAnd the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out\nover the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far\naway he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: \"What light\nis that?\"\n\nThen the skipper said: \"All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing\nnear that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked\nin the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me,\nand his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from\nthe Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my\nfather's father was young he heard from the very old man, his\ngreat-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess,\nfairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance,\nso never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is\nonly an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real.\"\n\nSo, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he\nsailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time\nthe light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine\nWhirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper\nasleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone\nover the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till\ndaylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to\ndread.\n\nBut when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the\npink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of\nblack water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and\non, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven\ndays he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you\ngive for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the\nfirst declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman\nKings.\n\nWhat he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes\nthat make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide\nwent down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened,\nbut every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day\nbefore. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had\nthoughtfully brought with him.\n\n[\"The Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools.\"\n_See page 88._]\n\nSo on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And\nwhen the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like\nwater in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put\nhis back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow\nsand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait.\n\nBy five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and\nbusy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge\noverhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with\ngolden hair and a green gown--and he went out to meet her.\n\n\"I've come to save you,\" he said. \"How darling and beautiful you are!\"\n\n\"You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,\" said the Princess,\nsmiling and giving him both her hands.\n\nHe shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.\n\n\"So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"But what about the dragon and the griffin?\" asked the Princess.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Nigel. \"I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill\nthem?\"\n\n\"Don't be a silly boy,\" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown\nup, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many\nyears, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. \"You\nhaven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!\"\n\n\"Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said the Princess, \"but only once in twenty-four hours, and\nthen the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The\ngriffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for\nfive minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the\nday before.\"\n\n\"What time does he sleep today?\" asked Nigel.\n\n\"At eleven,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Nigel, \"can you do sums?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Princess sadly. \"I was never good at them.\"\n\n\"Then I must,\" said Nigel. \"I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me\nvery unhappy. It'll take me days and days.\"\n\n\"Don't begin yet,\" said the Princess. \"You'll have plenty of time to be\nunhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself.\"\n\nSo he did. And then she told him all about herself.\n\n\"I know I've been here a long time,\" she said, \"but I don't know what\nTime is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my\nwedding day. And the griffin does the housework--his wings are so\nconvenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does\nthe cooking--he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and\nthough I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day,\nbecause my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve,\nand a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready.\"\n\nJust then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and\na snorting sound. \"It's the dragon,\" said the Princess hurriedly.\n\"Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done.\" And she ran away and\nleft him to his arithmetic.\n\nNow, the sum was this: \"If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down\nonce in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier\nevery twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does\nit three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in\nthe day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls\nasleep?\"\n\nIt is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute\nbecause you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your\nlessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work\nout his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by\npractice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by\nrule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by\ncompound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried\nit by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples\nin vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the\nsum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry,\nby logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an\nanswer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he\ncould not feel sure which answer was right.\n\nAnd just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it\nis to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was\ngetting dark.\n\n\"Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,\" she said, \"and you haven't\ndone it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the\nstatue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer\nto the sum.\"\n\nShe held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on\nit with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she\nhad scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:\n\n        AFTER NINE DAYS\n        T ii. 24.\n        D ii. 27 Ans.\n        P.S.--And the griffin is artificial. R.\n\nHe clapped his hands softly.\n\n\"Dear Princess,\" he said, \"I know that's the right answer. It says R\ntoo, you see. But I'll just prove it.\" So he hastily worked the sum\nbackward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules\nhe could think of. And it came right every time.\n\n\"So now we must wait,\" said he. And they waited.\n\nAnd every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked\nby the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was\nthere, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as\nhappy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and\nthe Princess laid their plans.\n\n\"You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?\" said Nigel.\n\n\"Quite,\" said the Princess. \"I only wish I were half as sure that he\nwouldn't hurt you.\"\n\n\"My Princess,\" he said tenderly, \"two great powers are on our side: the\npower of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than\nanything else in the world.\"\n\nSo when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to\nthe sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept\nwatch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin\nwas busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and\nhe gave a cry of rage--and it was like twenty engines all letting off\nsteam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station.\n\nAnd the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to\nlook at. His head was white with age--and his beard had grown so long\nthat he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with\nthe salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail\nwas long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any\nnumber of them--far too many--so that it looked like a very large fat\nsilkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as\nbayonets.\n\n\"Good-bye, love!\" cried Nigel, and ran out across the yellow sand toward\nthe sea. He had one end of a cord tied to his arm.\n\nThe dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he\nwas crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach\nafter Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet--and the\nvery end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a\nmark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he\nbreathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the\nlittle rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam.\n\nStill Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see\nnothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding\non tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had\ntold her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer,\nand looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to\nknow when to pull the rope.\n\nOn went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon after him. And the\ntide was low, and sleepy little waves lapped the sand's edge.\n\nNow at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the\ndragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the\nengines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second\nhalf of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy--it\nturned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so\nunsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to\nstone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life--and the tide\nbegan to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over,\nand he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for\ndear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf\nof rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into\nthe girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island.\n\nBut the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from\nbeing asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him.\n\n\"Now, there's only the griffin,\" said Nigel. And the Princess said:\n\"Yes--only--\" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of\nthe last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought\nof what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial--and\nnext day she said to Nigel: \"You know a griffin is half a lion and half\nan eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the\nleo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea.\"\n\nSo they talked it over and arranged everything.\n\nWhen the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went\nsoftly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the\nPrincess cried: \"Look out! There's a lion behind you.\"\n\nAnd the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large\nneck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its\neagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the\nKing-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each\nother. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather\nsleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being\nhalf asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in\nits deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and\nremember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one\nend of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion\nend to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it\ndied. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished,\nexactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats.\n\n\"Poor griffin,\" said the Princess, \"it was very good at the housework. I\nalways liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered.\"\n\nAt that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and\nthere was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue\nat the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her\ndear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her\npedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long.\n\nWhen they had all explained everything over and over to each other as\nmany times as was good for them, the witch said: \"Well, but what about\nthe whirlpools?\"\n\nAnd Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: \"I'm not a witch\nanymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those\nwhirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his\nblood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been\ntrying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now\nyou've only got to go out at low tide.\"\n\nSo Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy\nhollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first\ndrop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and\nnext day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as\nsmooth as glass.\n\nThe nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to\nthrow them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole\nsurface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of\nsomething so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed\nas thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some\ngood after all.\n\nWhen the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people\nto hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the\nPrincess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived\nhappily as long as was good for them.\n\nThe dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the\nlittle children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were\nleft of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden,\nbecause it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that\nit had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady\nfrom her lover.\n\nI have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on\nduring the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she\nlived on her income--and that is a thing that a great many people would\nlike to be able to do.\n\n[\"Little children play around him and over him.\" _See page\n96._]\n\n\n\n\n[VI\n\nTHE DRAGON TAMERS]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. The Dragon Tamers\n\n\nThere was once an old, old castle--it was so old that its walls and\ntowers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of\nall its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was\nhere that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to\nlive in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the\nruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a\nyear. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all\nthe work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the\ntrade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite\na large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the\ntown, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of\nwoodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a\npatent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all\nthings handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they\nwanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the\nblacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from\ntravelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the\nmayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very\nlarge; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his\nodds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great\ndungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a\nhandsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into\nthe wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one\nend was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where.\nEven the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where\nthose steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner\ndown the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the\nprisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond\nthe seventh step, and no more have I--so I know no more than he did what\nwas at the bottom of those stairs.\n\nJohn the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not\ndoing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the\nhappy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and\nlived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in\nthe summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole.\nAnd now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough\nto eat.\n\nAs for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when\nits mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry,\nquite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all.\nThis made her very tired.\n\nThe baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked,\nbut the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used\nto sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry.\n\nOne evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a\ngoat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the\ngoat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence\nor sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order\nJohn had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the\nbaby, who, for a wonder, was not crying.\n\nPresently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron,\nthere came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each\nother.\n\n\"I heard nothing,\" said he.\n\n\"Neither did I,\" said she.\n\nBut the noise grew louder--and the two were so anxious not to hear it\nthat he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered\nin his life, and she began to sing to the baby--a thing she had not had\nthe heart to do for weeks.\n\nBut through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder\nand louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had\nto. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring,\npurring--and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard\nit was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old\niron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the\nbroken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where.\n\n\"It can't be anything in the dungeon,\" said the blacksmith, wiping his\nface. \"Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute.\"\n\n\"There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?\" said his\nwife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing\nthere that presently they very nearly did believe it.\n\nThen the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer\nin the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and\nwent down to get the coals.\n\n\"I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,\"\nsaid he, \"but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal.\"\n\n\"I quite understand,\" said his wife, who had brought the coal home in\nher apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust.\n\nSo he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the\nbottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that\nthe dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual,\nexcept for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the\ncoals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it\nwas full of was Dragon.\n\n\"It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows\nwhere,\" said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried\nto creep back up the winding stairs.\n\nBut the dragon was too quick for him--it put out a great claw and caught\nhim by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys,\nor like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes.\n\n\"No you don't,\" said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp\nsquib.\n\n\"Deary, deary me,\" said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw\nof the dragon. \"Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!\"\n\nThe dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.\n\n\"Do you mind saying that again?\" said he, quite politely.\n\nSo John said again, very distinctly:\n\"_Here_--_is_--_a_--_nice_--_end_--_for_--_a_--_respectable_--_blacksmith._\"\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said the dragon. \"Fancy now! You're the very man I\nwanted.\"\n\n\"So I understood you to say before,\" said John, his teeth chattering.\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean what you mean,\" said the dragon, \"but I should like\nyou to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out\nof it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights?\"\n\n\"I might, sir,\" said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a\npossible customer, even if he be a dragon.\n\n\"A master craftsman--you are a master, of course?--can see in a minute\nwhat's wrong,\" the dragon went on. \"Just come around here and feel my\nplates, will you?\"\n\nJohn timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure\nenough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates\nnear the joint certainly wanted riveting.\n\nThe dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor--a sort of\ntawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt--and under it he\nseemed to be covered with something furry.\n\nAll the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease.\n\n\"You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,\" said he. \"In fact,\nyou want a good many.\"\n\n\"Well, get to work, then,\" said the dragon. \"You mend my wing, and then\nI'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job\nof it I'll eat you last. There!\"\n\n\"I don't want to be eaten last, sir,\" said John.\n\n\"Well then, I'll eat you first,\" said the dragon.\n\n\"I don't want that, sir, either,\" said John.\n\n\"Go on with you, you silly man,\" said the dragon, \"you don't know your\nown silly mind. Come, set to work.\"\n\n\"I don't like the job, sir,\" said John, \"and that's the truth. I know\nhow easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet\nme, and I'll eat you last'--and then you get to work and you give a\ngentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets--and then it's fire\nand smoke, and no apologies will meet the case.\"\n\n\"Upon my word of honor as a dragon,\" said the other.\n\n\"I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,\" said John, \"but any\ngentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your\nsniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?\"\n\n\"It would be so undignified,\" objected the dragon.\n\n\"We always fasten a horse up,\" said John, \"and he's the 'noble animal.'\"\n\n\"It's all very well,\" said the dragon, \"but how do I know you'd untie me\nagain when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you\nvalue most?\"\n\n\"My hammer,\" said John. \"A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer.\"\n\n\"But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else,\nand at once, or I'll eat you first.\"\n\nAt this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother\nhad been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night,\nand that it was time to begin.\n\n\"Whatever's that?\" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his\nbody rattled.\n\n\"It's only the baby,\" said John.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked the dragon. \"Something you value?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, sir, rather,\" said the blacksmith.\n\n\"Then bring it here,\" said the dragon, \"and I'll take care of it till\nyou've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up.\"\n\n\"All right, sir,\" said John, \"but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison\nto dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch--but don't\nyou go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come\nto a nice-looking gentleman like you.\"\n\nThe dragon purred at this compliment and said: \"All right, I'll be\ncareful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is.\"\n\nSo John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the\ndragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof\nof the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the\nruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John\npicked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's\nfront paws.\n\n\"You just purr to it, sir,\" he said, \"and it'll be as good as gold.\"\n\nSo the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it\nstopped crying.\n\nThen John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy\nchains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang\nover their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they\nmade were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let\nalone a dragon.\n\nJohn fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he\nhad padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many\nrivets would be needed.\n\n\"Six, eight, ten--twenty, forty,\" said he. \"I haven't half enough rivets\nin the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge\nand get a few dozen. I won't be a minute.\"\n\n[\"The dragon's purring pleased the baby.\" _See page\n106._]\n\nAnd off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws,\nlaughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it.\n\nJohn ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and\ncorporation.\n\n\"There's a dragon in my dungeon,\" he said; \"I've chained him up. Now\ncome and help to get my baby away.\"\n\nAnd he told them all about it.\n\nBut they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they\npraised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the\nmatter in his hands.\n\n\"But what about my baby?\" said John.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the mayor, \"if anything should happen, you will always\nbe able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause.\"\n\nSo John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale.\n\n\"You've given the baby to the dragon!\" she cried. \"Oh, you unnatural\nparent!\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said John, and he told her some more. \"Now,\" he said, \"I'm going\ndown. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy\nwill be all right.\"\n\nSo down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with\nall his might to keep the baby quiet.\n\n\"Hurry up, can't you?\" he said. \"I can't keep up this noise all night.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" said the blacksmith, \"but all the shops are shut.\nThe job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to\ntake care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid.\nGood night, sir.\"\n\nThe dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath--so now he\nstopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone\nmust have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to\nscream. So it began.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said the dragon, \"this is awful.\" He patted the baby with\nhis claw, but it screamed more than ever.\n\n\"And I am so tired too,\" said the dragon. \"I did so hope I should have a\ngood night.\"\n\nThe baby went on screaming.\n\n\"There'll be no peace for me after this,\" said the dragon. \"It's enough\nto ruin one's nerves. Hush, then--did 'ums, then.\" And he tried to quiet\nthe baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing\n\"Hush-a-by, Dragon,\" the baby screamed more and more and more. \"I can't\nkeep it quiet,\" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman\nsitting on the steps. \"Here, I say,\" said he, \"do you know anything\nabout babies?\"\n\n\"I do, a little,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,\" said the\ndragon, yawning. \"You can bring it back in the morning before the\nblacksmith comes.\"\n\nSo the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her\nhusband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and\nsaved the baby.\n\nAnd next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon\nexactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it\nand set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously\nfor days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet.\n\nSo now John went to the mayor, and said: \"I've got the dragon and I've\nsaved the town.\"\n\n\"Noble preserver,\" cried the mayor, \"we will get up a subscription for\nyou, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath.\"\n\nSo the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each\ngave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and\nhalf crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the\nmayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to\ncelebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired,\nespecially by the mayor and corporation.\n\nThe first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to\nhave the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance\nrendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy\nof the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the\nactions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a\nfeeling heart or a well-balanced brain.\n\nWhen the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a\ncommittee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of\nit went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third\nwas spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and\ngold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left\nwent in committee expenses.\n\nSo there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the\nknowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this\nthings went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby\ndid not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the\ngoat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete\nset of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2\nshillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited\nconduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off,\nand pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron\ngrating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon--and it was threepence extra\nfor each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by,\nwhich, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear\nprofit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at\nninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week.\n\nThe baby--named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for\nshort--began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the\ndaughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear\nlittle girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of\nhearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by\na real dragon.\n\nThe two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at\nthe dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they\nwould light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And\nthey grew older and wiser.\n\nAt last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their\ngold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a\nlame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes\ntoward the town.\n\n\"We're lost,\" said the mayor. \"I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who\ncould keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats--by his\nteeth.\"\n\nNo one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening,\nand they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would\ncarry them.\n\nThey ran through the forge, and down the dungeon steps, and knocked at\nthe iron door. \"Who's there?\" said the dragon. \"It's only us,\" said the\nchildren.\n\nAnd the dragon was so dull from having been alone for ten years that he\nsaid: \"Come in, dears.\"\n\n\"You won't hurt us, or breathe fire at us or anything?\" asked Tina.\n\nAnd the dragon said, \"Not for worlds.\"\n\nSo they went in and talked to him, and told him what the weather was\nlike outside, and what there was in the papers, and at last Johnnie\nsaid: \"There's a lame giant in the town. He wants you.\"\n\n\"Does he?\" said the dragon, showing his teeth. \"If only I were out of\nthis!\"\n\n\"If we let you loose you might manage to run away before he could catch\nyou.\"\n\n\"Yes, I might,\" answered the dragon, \"but then again I mightn't.\"\n\n\"Why--you'd never fight him?\" said Tina.\n\n\"No,\" said the dragon; \"I'm all for peace, I am. You let me out, and\nyou'll see.\"\n\nSo the children loosed the dragon from the chains and the collar, and\nhe broke down one end of the dungeon and went out--only pausing at the\nforge door to get the blacksmith to rivet his wing.\n\nHe met the lame giant at the gate of the town, and the giant banged on\nthe dragon with his club as if he were banging an iron foundry, and the\ndragon behaved like a smelting works--all fire and smoke. It was a\nfearful sight, and people watched it from a distance, falling off their\nlegs with the shock of every bang, but always getting up to look again.\n\nAt last the dragon won, and the giant sneaked away across the marshes,\nand the dragon, who was very tired, went home to sleep, announcing his\nintention of eating the town in the morning. He went back into his old\ndungeon because he was a stranger in the town, and he did not know of\nany other respectable lodging. Then Tina and Johnnie went to the mayor\nand corporation and said, \"The giant is settled. Please give us the\nthousand pounds reward.\"\n\nBut the mayor said: \"No, no, my boy. It is not you who have settled the\ngiant, it is the dragon. I suppose you have chained him up again? When\nhe comes to claim the reward he shall have it.\"\n\n\"He isn't chained up yet,\" said Johnnie. \"Shall I send him to claim the\nreward?\"\n\nBut the mayor said he need not trouble; and now he offered a thousand\npounds to anyone who would get the dragon chained up again.\n\n\"I don't trust you,\" said Johnnie. \"Look how you treated my father when\nhe chained up the dragon.\"\n\nBut the people who were listening at the door interrupted, and said that\nif Johnnie could fasten up the dragon again they would turn out the\nmayor and let Johnnie be mayor in his place. For they had been\ndissatisfied with the mayor for some time, and thought they would like a\nchange.\n\nSo Johnnie said, \"Done,\" and off he went, hand in hand with Tina, and\nthey called on all their little friends and said: \"Will you help us to\nsave the town?\"\n\nAnd all the children said: \"Yes, of course we will. What fun!\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Tina, \"you must all bring your basins of bread and\nmilk to the forge tomorrow at breakfast time.\"\n\n\"And if ever I am mayor,\" said Johnnie, \"I will give a banquet, and you\nshall be invited. And we'll have nothing but sweet things from beginning\nto end.\"\n\nAll the children promised, and next morning Tina and Johnnie rolled\ntheir big washing tub down the winding stair.\n\n\"What's that noise?\" asked the dragon.\n\n\"It's only a big giant breathing,\" said Tina, \"He's gone by now.\"\n\nThen, when all the town children brought their bread and milk, Tina\nemptied it into the wash tub, and when the tub was full Tina knocked at\nthe iron door with the grating in it and said: \"May we come in?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the dragon, \"it's very dull here.\"\n\nSo they went in, and with the help of nine other children they lifted\nthe washing tub in and set it down by the dragon. Then all the other\nchildren went away, and Tina and Johnnie sat down and cried.\n\n\"What's this?\" asked the dragon. \"And what's the matter?\"\n\n\"This is bread and milk,\" said Johnnie; \"it's our breakfast--all of it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the dragon, \"I don't see what you want with breakfast. I'm\ngoing to eat everyone in the town as soon as I've rested a little.\"\n\n\"Dear Mr. Dragon,\" said Tina, \"I wish you wouldn't eat us. How would you\nlike to be eaten yourself?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" the dragon confessed, \"but nobody will eat me.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Johnnie, \"there's a giant--\"\n\n\"I know. I fought with him, and licked him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but there's another come now--the one you fought was only this\none's little boy. This one is half as big again.\"\n\n\"He's seven times as big,\" said Tina.\n\n\"No, nine times,\" said Johnnie. \"He's bigger than the steeple.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said the dragon. \"I never expected this.\"\n\n\"And the mayor has told him where you are,\" Tina went on, \"and he is\ncoming to eat you as soon as he has sharpened his big knife. The mayor\ntold him you were a wild dragon--but he didn't mind. He said he only ate\nwild dragons--with bread sauce.\"\n\n\"That's tiresome,\" said the dragon. \"And I suppose this sloppy stuff in\nthe tub is the bread sauce?\"\n\nThe children said it was. \"Of course,\" they added, \"bread sauce is only\nserved with wild dragons. Tame ones are served with apple sauce and\nonion stuffing. What a pity you're not a tame one: He'd never look at\nyou then,\" they said. \"Good-bye, poor dragon, we shall never see you\nagain, and now you'll know what it's like to be eaten.\" And they began\nto cry again.\n\n\"Well, but look here,\" said the dragon, \"couldn't you pretend I was a\ntame dragon? Tell the giant that I'm just a poor little timid tame\ndragon that you kept for a pet.\"\n\n\"He'd never believe it,\" said Johnnie. \"If you were our tame dragon we\nshould keep you tied up, you know. We shouldn't like to risk losing such\na dear, pretty pet.\"\n\nThen the dragon begged them to fasten him up at once, and they did so:\nwith the collar and chains that were made years ago--in the days when\nmen sang over their work and made it strong enough to bear any strain.\n\nAnd then they went away and told the people what they had done, and\nJohnnie was made mayor, and had a glorious feast exactly as he had said\nhe would--with nothing in it but sweet things. It began with Turkish\ndelight and halfpenny buns, and went on with oranges, toffee, coconut\nice, peppermints, jam puffs, raspberry-noyeau, ice creams, and\nmeringues, and ended with bull's-eyes and gingerbread and acid drops.\n\nThis was all very well for Johnnie and Tina; but if you are kind\nchildren with feeling hearts you will perhaps feel sorry for the poor\ndeceived, deluded dragon--chained up in the dull dungeon, with nothing\nto do but to think over the shocking untruths that Johnnie had told him.\n\nWhen he thought how he had been tricked, the poor captive dragon began\nto weep--and the large tears fell down over his rusty plates. And\npresently he began to feel faint, as people sometimes do when they have\nbeen crying, especially if they have not had anything to eat for ten\nyears or so.\n\nAnd then the poor creature dried his eyes and looked about him, and\nthere he saw the tub of bread and milk. So he thought, \"If giants like\nthis damp, white stuff, perhaps I should like it too,\" and he tasted a\nlittle, and liked it so much that he ate it all up.\n\nAnd the next time the tourists came, and Johnnie let off the colored\nfire, the dragon said shyly: \"Excuse my troubling you, but could you\nbring me a little more bread and milk?\"\n\nSo Johnnie arranged that people should go around with carts every day to\ncollect the children's bread and milk for the dragon. The children were\nfed at the town's expense--on whatever they liked; and they ate nothing\nbut cake and buns and sweet things, and they said the poor dragon was\nvery welcome to their bread and milk.\n\nNow, when Johnnie had been mayor ten years or so he married Tina, and on\ntheir wedding morning they went to see the dragon. He had grown quite\ntame, and his rusty plates had fallen off in places, and underneath he\nwas soft and furry to stroke. So now they stroked him.\n\nAnd he said, \"I don't know how I could ever have liked eating anything\nbut bread and milk. I _am_ a tame dragon now, aren't I?\" And when they\nsaid that yes, he was, the dragon said: \"I am so tame, won't you undo\nme?\" And some people would have been afraid to trust him, but Johnnie\nand Tina were so happy on their wedding day that they could not believe\nany harm of anyone in the world. So they loosened the chains, and the\ndragon said: \"Excuse me a moment, there are one or two little things I\nshould like to fetch,\" and he moved off to those mysterious steps and\nwent down them, out of sight into the darkness. And as he moved, more\nand more of his rusty plates fell off.\n\nIn a few minutes they heard him clanking up the steps. He brought\nsomething in his mouth--it was a bag of gold.\n\n\"It's no good to me,\" he said. \"Perhaps you might find it useful.\" So\nthey thanked him very kindly.\n\n\"More where that came from,\" said he, and fetched more and more and\nmore, till they told him to stop. So now they were rich, and so were\ntheir fathers and mothers. Indeed, everyone was rich, and there were no\nmore poor people in the town. And they all got rich without working,\nwhich is very wrong; but the dragon had never been to school, as you\nhave, so he knew no better.\n\nAnd as the dragon came out of the dungeon, following Johnnie and Tina\ninto the bright gold and blue of their wedding day, he blinked his eyes\nas a cat does in the sunshine, and he shook himself, and the last of his\nplates dropped off, and his wings with them, and he was just like a\nvery, very extra-sized cat. And from that day he grew furrier and\nfurrier, and he was the beginning of all cats. Nothing of the dragon\nremained except the claws, which all cats have still, as you can easily\nascertain.\n\nAnd I hope you see now how important it is to feed your cat with bread\nand milk. If you were to let it have nothing to eat but mice and birds\nit might grow larger and fiercer, and scalier and tailier, and get wings\nand turn into the beginning of dragons. And then there would be all the\nbother over again.\n\n[\"He brought something in his mouth--it was a bag of\ngold.\" _See page 116._]\n\n\n\n\n[VII\n\nTHE FIERY DRAGON]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. The Fiery Dragon,\n\nor The Heart of Stone and the Heart of Gold\n\n\nThe little white Princess always woke in her little white bed when the\nstarlings began to chatter in the pearl gray morning. As soon as the\nwoods were awake, she used to run up the twisting turret-stairs with her\nlittle bare feet, and stand on the top of the tower in her white\nbed-gown, and kiss her hands to the sun and to the woods and to the\nsleeping town, and say: \"Good morning, pretty world!\"\n\nThen she would run down the cold stone steps and dress herself in her\nshort skirt and her cap and apron, and begin the day's work. She swept\nthe rooms and made the breakfast, she washed the dishes and she scoured\nthe pans, and all this she did because she was a real Princess. For of\nall who should have served her, only one remained faithful--her old\nnurse, who had lived with her in the tower all the Princess's life. And,\nnow the nurse was old and feeble, the Princess would not let her work\nany more, but did all the housework herself, while Nurse sat still and\ndid the sewing, because this was a real Princess with skin like milk and\nhair like flax and a heart like gold.\n\nHer name was Sabrinetta, and her grandmother was Sabra, who married St.\nGeorge after he had killed the dragon, and by real rights all the\ncountry belonged to her: the woods that stretched away to the mountains,\nthe downs that sloped down to the sea, the pretty fields of corn and\nmaize and rye, the olive orchards and the vineyards, and the little town\nitself--with its towers and its turrets, its steep roofs and strange\nwindows--that nestled in the hollow between the sea, where the whirlpool\nwas, and the mountains, white with snow and rosy with sunrise.\n\nBut when her father and mother had died, leaving her cousin to take care\nof the kingdom till she grew up, he, being a very evil Prince, took\neverything away from her, and all the people followed him, and now\nnothing was left her of all her possessions except the great dragon\nproof tower that her grandfather, St. George, had built, and of all who\nshould have been her servants only the good nurse.\n\nThis was why Sabrinetta was the first person in all the land to get a\nglimpse of the wonder.\n\nEarly, early, early, while all the townspeople were fast asleep, she ran\nup the turret-steps and looked out over the field, and at the other side\nof the field there was a green, ferny ditch and a rose-thorny hedge, and\nthen came the wood. And as Sabrinetta stood on her tower she saw a\nshaking and a twisting of the rose-thorny hedge, and then something very\nbright and shining wriggled out through it into the ferny ditch and back\nagain. It only came out for a minute, but she saw it quite plainly, and\nshe said to herself: \"Dear me, what a curious, shiny, bright-looking\ncreature! If it were bigger, and if I didn't know that there have been\nno fabulous monsters for quite a long time now, I should almost think it\nwas a dragon.\"\n\nThe thing, whatever it was, did look rather like a dragon--but then it\nwas too small; and it looked rather like a lizard--only then it was too\nbig. It was about as long as a hearthrug.\n\n\"I wish it had not been in such a hurry to get back into the wood,\" said\nSabrinetta. \"Of course, it's quite safe for me, in my dragonproof tower;\nbut if it is a dragon, it's quite big enough to eat people, and today's\nthe first of May, and the children go out to get flowers in the wood.\"\n\nWhen Sabrinetta had done the housework (she did not leave so much as a\nspeck of dust anywhere, even in the corneriest corner of the winding\nstair) she put on her milk white, silky gown with the moon-daisies\nworked on it, and went up to the top of her tower again.\n\nAcross the fields troops of children were going out to gather the may,\nand the sound of their laughter and singing came up to the top of the\ntower.\n\n\"I do hope it wasn't a dragon,\" said Sabrinetta.\n\nThe children went by twos and by threes and by tens and by twenties, and\nthe red and blue and yellow and white of their frocks were scattered on\nthe green of the field.\n\n\"It's like a green silk mantle worked with flowers,\" said the Princess,\nsmiling.\n\nThen by twos and by threes, by tens and by twenties, the children\nvanished into the wood, till the mantle of the field was left plain\ngreen once more.\n\n\"All the embroidery is unpicked,\" said the Princess, sighing.\n\nThe sun shone, and the sky was blue, and the fields were quite green,\nand all the flowers were very bright indeed, because it was May Day.\n\nThen quite suddenly a cloud passed over the sun, and the silence was\nbroken by shrieks from far off; and, like a many-colored torrent, all\nthe children burst from the wood and rushed, a red and blue and yellow\nand white wave, across the field, screaming as they ran. Their voices\ncame up to the Princess on her tower, and she heard the words threaded\non their screams like beads on sharp needles: \"The dragon, the dragon,\nthe dragon! Open the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon!\"\n\nAnd they swept across the field and into the gate of the town, and the\nPrincess heard the gate bang, and the children were out of sight--but on\nthe other side of the field the rose-thorns crackled and smashed in the\nhedge, and something very large and glaring and horrible trampled the\nferns in the ditch for one moment before it hid itself again in the\ncovert of the wood.\n\nThe Princess went down and told her nurse, and the nurse at once locked\nthe great door of the tower and put the key in her pocket.\n\n\"Let them take care of themselves,\" she said, when the Princess begged\nto be allowed to go out and help to take care of the children. \"My\nbusiness is to take care of you, my precious, and I'm going to do it.\nOld as I am, I can turn a key still.\"\n\nSo Sabrinetta went up again to the top of her tower, and cried whenever\nshe thought of the children and the fiery dragon. For she knew, of\ncourse, that the gates of the town were not dragonproof, and that the\ndragon could just walk in whenever he liked.\n\nThe children ran straight to the palace, where the Prince was cracking\nhis hunting whip down at the kennels, and told him what had happened.\n\n\"Good sport,\" said the Prince, and he ordered out his pack of\nhippopotamuses at once. It was his custom to hunt big game with\nhippopotamuses, and people would not have minded that so much--but he\nwould swagger about in the streets of the town with his pack yelping and\ngamboling at his heels, and when he did that, the green-grocer, who had\nhis stall in the marketplace, always regretted it; and the crockery\nmerchant, who spread his wares on the pavement, was ruined for life\nevery time the Prince chose to show off his pack.\n\nThe Prince rode out of the town with his hippopotamuses trotting and\nfrisking behind him, and people got inside their houses as quickly as\nthey could when they heard the voices of his pack and the blowing of his\nhorn. The pack squeezed through the town gates and off across country to\nhunt the dragon. Few of you who had not seen a pack of hippopotamuses in\nfull cry will be able to imagine at all what the hunt was like. To begin\nwith, hippopotamuses do not bay like hounds: They grunt like pigs, and\ntheir grunt is very big and fierce. Then, of course, no one expects\nhippopotamuses to jump. They just crash through the hedges and lumber\nthrough the standing corn, doing serious injury to the crops, and\nannoying the farmers very much. All the hippopotamuses had collars with\ntheir name and address on, but when the farmers called at the palace to\ncomplain of the injury to their standing crops, the Prince always said\nit served them right for leaving their crops standing about in people's\nway, and he never paid anything at all.\n\nSo now, when he and his pack went out, several people in the town\nwhispered, \"I wish the dragon would eat him\"--which was very wrong of\nthem, no doubt, but then he was such a very nasty Prince.\n\nThey hunted by field, and they hunted by wold; they drew the woods\nblank, and the scent didn't lie on the downs at all. The dragon was shy,\nand would not show himself.\n\nBut just as the Prince was beginning to think there was no dragon at\nall, but only a cock and bull, his favourite old hippopotamus gave\ntongue. The Prince blew his horn and shouted: \"Tally ho! Hark forward!\nTantivy!\" and the whole pack charged downhill toward the hollow by the\nwood. For there, plain to be seen, was the dragon, as big as a barge,\nglowing like a furnace, and spitting fire and showing his shining teeth.\n\n\"The hunt is up!\" cried the Prince. And indeed it was. For the\ndragon--instead of behaving as a quarry should, and running away--ran\nstraight at the pack, and the Prince, on his elephant, had the\nmortification of seeing his prize pack swallowed up one by one in the\ntwinkling of an eye, by the dragon they had come out to hunt. The dragon\nswallowed all the hippopotamuses just as a dog swallows bits of meat. It\nwas a shocking sight. Of the whole of the pack that had come out\nsporting so merrily to the music of the horn, now not even a\npuppy-hippopotamus was left, and the dragon was looking anxiously around\nto see if he had forgotten anything.\n\nThe Prince slipped off his elephant on the other side and ran into the\nthickest part of the wood. He hoped the dragon could not break through\nthe bushes there, since they were very strong and close. He went\ncrawling on hands and knees in a most un-Prince-like way, and at last,\nfinding a hollow tree, he crept into it. The wood was very still--no\ncrashing of branches and no smell of burning came to alarm the Prince.\nHe drained the silver hunting bottle slung from his shoulder, and\nstretched his legs in the hollow tree. He never shed a single tear for\nhis poor tame hippopotamuses who had eaten from his hand and followed\nhim faithfully in all the pleasures of the chase for so many years. For\nhe was a false Prince, with a skin like leather and hair like hearth\nbrushes and a heart like a stone. He never shed a tear, but he just went\nto sleep.\n\nWhen he awoke it was dark. He crept out of the tree and rubbed his eyes.\nThe wood was black about him, but there was a red glow in a dell close\nby. It was a fire of sticks, and beside it sat a ragged youth with long,\nyellow hair; all around lay sleeping forms which breathed heavily.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said the Prince.\n\n\"I'm Elfin, the pig keeper,\" said the ragged youth. \"And who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm Tiresome, the Prince,\" said the other.\n\n\"And what are you doing out of your palace at this time of night?\" asked\nthe pig keeper, severely.\n\n\"I've been hunting,\" said the Prince.\n\nThe pig keeper laughed. \"Oh, it was you I saw, then? A good hunt, wasn't\nit? My pigs and I were looking on.\"\n\nAll the sleeping forms grunted and snored, and the Prince saw that they\nwere pigs: He knew it by their manners.\n\n\"If you had known as much as I do,\" Elfin went on, \"you might have saved\nyour pack.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Tiresome.\n\n\"Why, the dragon,\" said Elfin. \"You went out at the wrong time of day.\nThe dragon should be hunted at night.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said the Prince, with a shudder. \"A daylight hunt is\nquite good enough for me, you silly pig keeper.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Elfin, \"do as you like about it--the dragon will come\nand hunt you tomorrow, as likely as not. I don't care if he does, you\nsilly Prince.\"\n\n\"You're very rude,\" said Tiresome.\n\n\"Oh, no, only truthful,\" said Elfin.\n\n\"Well, tell me the truth, then. What is it that, if I had known as much\nas you do about, I shouldn't have lost my hippopotamuses?\"\n\n\"You don't speak very good English,\" said Elfin. \"But come, what will\nyou give me if I tell you?\"\n\n\"If you tell me what?\" said the tiresome Prince.\n\n\"What you want to know.\"\n\n\"I don't want to know anything,\" said Prince Tiresome.\n\n\"Then you're more of a silly even than I thought,\" said Elfin. \"Don't\nyou want to know how to settle the dragon before he settles you?\"\n\n\"It might be as well,\" the Prince admitted.\n\n\"Well, I haven't much patience at any time,\" said Elfin, \"and now I can\nassure you that there's very little left. What will you give me if I\ntell you?\"\n\n\"Half my kingdom,\" said the Prince, \"and my cousin's hand in marriage.\"\n\n\"Done,\" said the pig keeper. \"Here goes! The dragon grows small at\nnight! He sleeps under the root of this tree. I use him to light my fire\nwith.\"\n\nAnd, sure enough, there under the tree was the dragon on a nest of\nscorched moss, and he was about as long as your finger.\n\n\"How can I kill him?\" asked the Prince.\n\n\"I don't know that you can kill him,\" said Elfin, \"but you can take him\naway if you've brought anything to put him in. That bottle of yours\nwould do.\"\n\nSo between them they managed, with bits of stick and by singeing their\nfingers a little, to poke and shove the dragon till they made it creep\ninto the silver hunting bottle, and then the Prince screwed on the top\ntight.\n\n\"Now we've got him,\" said Elfin. \"Let's take him home and put Solomon's\nseal on the mouth of the bottle, and then he'll be safe enough. Come\nalong--we'll divide up the kingdom tomorrow, and then I shall have some\nmoney to buy fine clothes to go courting in.\"\n\nBut when the wicked Prince made promises he did not make them to keep.\n\n\"Go on with you! What do you mean?\" he said. \"I found the dragon and\nI've imprisoned him. I never said a word about courtings or kingdoms. If\nyou say I did, I shall cut your head off at once.\" And he drew his\nsword.\n\n\"All right,\" said Elfin, shrugging his shoulders. \"I'm better off than\nyou are, anyhow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" spluttered the Prince.\n\n\"Why, you've only got a kingdom (and a dragon), but I've got clean hands\n(and five and seventy fine black pigs).\"\n\nSo Elfin sat down again by his fire, and the Prince went home and told\nhis Parliament how clever and brave he had been, and though he woke them\nup on purpose to tell them, they were not angry, but said: \"You are\nindeed brave and clever.\" For they knew what happened to people with\nwhom the Prince was not pleased.\n\nThen the Prime Minister solemnly put Solomon's seal on the mouth of the\nbottle, and the bottle was put in the Treasury, which was the strongest\nbuilding in the town, and was made of solid copper, with walls as thick\nas Waterloo Bridge.\n\nThe bottle was set down among the sacks of gold, and the junior\nsecretary to the junior clerk of the last Lord of the Treasury was\nappointed to sit up all night with it and see if anything happened. The\njunior secretary had never seen a dragon, and, what was more, he did not\nbelieve the Prince had ever seen a dragon either. The Prince had never\nbeen a really truthful boy, and it would have been just like him to\nbring home a bottle with nothing in it and then to pretend that there\nwas a dragon inside. So the junior secretary did not at all mind being\nleft. They gave him the key, and when everyone in the town had gone back\nto bed he let in some of the junior secretaries from other Government\ndepartments, and they had a jolly game of hide-and-seek among the sacks\nof gold, and played marbles with the diamonds and rubies and pearls in\nthe big ivory chests.\n\nThey enjoyed themselves very much, but by-and-by the copper treasury\nbegan to get warmer and warmer, and suddenly the junior secretary cried\nout, \"Look at the bottle!\"\n\nThe bottle sealed with Solomon's seal had swollen to three times its\nproper size and seemed to be nearly red hot, and the air got warmer and\nwarmer and the bottle bigger and bigger, till all the junior secretaries\nagreed that the place was too hot to hold them, and out they went,\ntumbling over each other in their haste, and just as the last got out\nand locked the door the bottle burst, and out came the dragon, very\nfiery, and swelling more and more every minute, and he began to eat the\nsacks of gold and crunch up the pearls and diamonds and rubies as if\nthey were sugar.\n\nBy breakfasttime he had devoured the whole of the Prince's treasures,\nand when the Prince came along the street at about eleven, he met the\ndragon coming out of the broken door of the Treasury, with molten gold\nstill dripping from his jaws. Then the Prince turned and ran for his\nlife, and as he ran toward the dragonproof tower the little white\nPrincess saw him coming, and she ran down and unlocked the door and let\nhim in, and slammed the dragonproof door in the fiery face of the\ndragon, who sat down and whined outside, because he wanted the Prince\nvery much indeed.\n\nThe Princess took Prince Tiresome into the best room, and laid the\ncloth, and gave him cream and eggs and white grapes and honey and bread,\nwith many other things, yellow and white and good to eat, and she served\nhim just as kindly as she would have done if he had been anyone else\ninstead of the bad Prince who had taken away her kingdom and kept it for\nhimself--because she was a true Princess and had a heart of gold.\n\nWhen he had eaten and drunk, he begged the Princess to show him how to\nlock and unlock the door. The nurse was asleep, so there was no one to\ntell the Princess not to, and she did.\n\n[\"The junior secretary cried out, 'Look at the bottle!'\"\n_See page 129._]\n\n\"You turn the key like this,\" she said, \"and the door keeps shut. But\nturn it nine times around the wrong way, and the door flies open.\"\n\nAnd so it did. And the moment it opened, the Prince pushed the white\nPrincess out of her tower, just as he had pushed her out of her kingdom,\nand shut the door. For he wanted to have the tower all for himself. And\nthere she was, in the street, and on the other side of the way the\ndragon was sitting whining, but he did not try to eat her,\nbecause--though the old nurse did not know it--dragons cannot eat white\nPrincesses with hearts of gold.\n\nThe Princess could not walk through the streets of the town in her\nmilky-silky gown with the daisies on it, and with no hat and no gloves,\nso she turned the other way, and ran out across the meadows, toward the\nwood. She had never been out of her tower before, and the soft grass\nunder her feet felt like grass of Paradise.\n\nShe ran right into the thickest part of the wood, because she did not\nknow what her heart was made of, and she was afraid of the dragon, and\nthere in a dell she came on Elfin and his five and seventy fine pigs. He\nwas playing his flute, and around him the pigs were dancing cheerfully\non their hind legs.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said the Princess, \"do take care of me. I am so frightened.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Elfin, putting his arms around her. \"Now you are quite\nsafe. What were you frightened of?\"\n\n\"The dragon,\" she said.\n\n\"So it's gotten out of the silver bottle,\" said Elfin. \"I hope it's\neaten the Prince.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sabrinetta. \"But why?\"\n\nHe told her of the mean trick that the Prince had played on him.\n\n\"And he promised me half his kingdom and the hand of his cousin the\nPrincess,\" said Elfin.\n\n\"Oh, dear, what a shame!\" said Sabrinetta, trying to get out of his\narms. \"How dare he?\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked, holding her tighter. \"It _was_ a shame,\nor at least _I_ thought so. But now he may keep his kingdom, half and\nwhole, if I may keep what I have.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked the Princess.\n\n\"Why, you--my pretty, my dear,\" said Elfin, \"and as for the Princess,\nhis cousin--forgive me, dearest heart, but when I asked for her I hadn't\nseen the real Princess, the _only_ Princess, _my_ Princess.\"\n\n\"Do you mean me?\" said Sabrinetta.\n\n\"Who else?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, but five minutes ago you hadn't seen me!\"\n\n\"Five minutes ago I was a pig keeper--now I've held you in my arms I'm a\nPrince, though I should have to keep pigs to the end of my days.\"\n\n\"But you haven't asked _me_,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"You asked me to take care of you,\" said Elfin, \"and I will--all my life\nlong.\"\n\nSo that was settled, and they began to talk of really important things,\nsuch as the dragon and the Prince, and all the time Elfin did not know\nthat this was the Princess, but he knew that she had a heart of gold,\nand he told her so, many times.\n\n\"The mistake,\" said Elfin, \"was in not having a dragonproof bottle. I\nsee that now.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that all?\" said the Princess. \"I can easily get you one of\nthose--because everything in my tower is dragonproof. We ought to do\nsomething to settle the dragon and save the little children.\"\n\nSo she started off to get the bottle, but she would not let Elfin come\nwith her.\n\n\"If what you say is true,\" she said, \"if you are sure that I have a\nheart of gold, the dragon won't hurt me, and somebody must stay with the\npigs.\"\n\nElfin was quite sure, so he let her go.\n\nShe found the door of her tower open. The dragon had waited patiently\nfor the Prince, and the moment he opened the door and came out--though\nhe was only out for an instant to post a letter to his Prime Minister\nsaying where he was and asking them to send the fire brigade to deal\nwith the fiery dragon--the dragon ate him. Then the dragon went back to\nthe wood, because it was getting near his time to grow small for the\nnight.\n\nSo Sabrinetta went in and kissed her nurse and made her a cup of tea and\nexplained what was going to happen, and that she had a heart of gold, so\nthe dragon couldn't eat her; and the nurse saw that of course the\nPrincess was quite safe, and kissed her and let her go.\n\nShe took the dragonproof bottle, made of burnished brass, and ran back\nto the wood, and to the dell, where Elfin was sitting among his sleek\nblack pigs, waiting for her.\n\n\"I thought you were never coming back,\" he said. \"You have been away a\nyear, at least.\"\n\nThe Princess sat down beside him among the pigs, and they held each\nother's hands till it was dark, and then the dragon came crawling over\nthe moss, scorching it as he came, and getting smaller as he crawled,\nand curled up under the root of the tree.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Elfin, \"you hold the bottle.\" Then he poked and prodded\nthe dragon with bits of stick till it crawled into the dragonproof\nbottle. But there was no stopper.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Elfin. \"I'll put my finger in for a stopper.\"\n\n\"No, let me,\" said the Princess. But of course Elfin would not let her.\nHe stuffed his finger into the top of the bottle, and the Princess cried\nout: \"The sea--the sea--run for the cliffs!\" And off they went, with the\nfive and seventy pigs trotting steadily after them in a long black\nprocession.\n\nThe bottle got hotter and hotter in Elfin's hands, because the dragon\ninside was puffing fire and smoke with all his might--hotter and hotter\nand hotter--but Elfin held on till they came to the cliff edge, and\nthere was the dark blue sea, and the whirlpool going around and around.\n\nElfin lifted the bottle high above his head and hurled it out between\nthe stars and the sea, and it fell in the middle of the whirlpool.\n\n\"We've saved the country,\" said the Princess. \"You've saved the little\nchildren. Give me your hands.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Elfin. \"I shall never be able to take your dear hands\nagain. My hands are burnt off.\"\n\nAnd so they were: There were only black cinders where his hands ought to\nhave been. The Princess kissed them, and cried over them, and tore\npieces of her silky-milky gown to tie them up with, and the two went\nback to the tower and told the nurse all about everything. And the pigs\nsat outside and waited.\n\n\"He is the bravest man in the world,\" said Sabrinetta. \"He has saved the\ncountry and the little children; but, oh, his hands--his poor, dear,\ndarling hands!\"\n\nHere the door of the room opened, and the oldest of the five and seventy\npigs came in. It went up to Elfin and rubbed itself against him with\nlittle loving grunts.\n\n\"See the dear creature,\" said the nurse, wiping away a tear. \"It knows,\nit knows!\"\n\nSabrinetta stroked the pig, because Elfin had no hands for stroking or\nfor anything else.\n\n\"The only cure for a dragon burn,\" said the old nurse, \"is pig's fat,\nand well that faithful creature knows it----\"\n\n\"I wouldn't for a kingdom,\" cried Elfin, stroking the pig as best he\ncould with his elbow.\n\n\"Is there no other cure?\" asked the Princess.\n\nHere another pig put its black nose in at the door, and then another and\nanother, till the room was full of pigs, a surging mass of rounded\nblackness, pushing and struggling to get at Elfin, and grunting softly\nin the language of true affection.\n\n\"There is one other,\" said the nurse. \"The dear, affectionate\nbeasts--they all want to die for you.\"\n\n\"What is the other cure?\" said Sabrinetta anxiously.\n\n\"If a man is burnt by a dragon,\" said the nurse, \"and a certain number\nof people are willing to die for him, it is enough if each should kiss\nthe burn and wish it well in the depths of his loving heart.\"\n\n\"The number! The number!\" cried Sabrinetta.\n\n\"Seventy-seven,\" said the nurse.\n\n\"We have only seventy-five pigs,\" said the Princess, \"and with me that's\nseventy-six!\"\n\n\"It must be seventy-seven--and I really can't die for him, so nothing\ncan be done,\" said the nurse, sadly. \"He must have cork hands.\"\n\n\"I knew about the seventy-seven loving people,\" said Elfin. \"But I never\nthought my dear pigs loved me so much as all this, and my dear too--and,\nof course, that only makes it more impossible. There's one other charm\nthat cures dragon burns, though; but I'd rather be burnt black all over\nthan marry anyone but you, my dear, my pretty.\"\n\n\"Why, who must you marry to cure your dragon burns?\" asked Sabrinetta.\n\n\"A Princess. That's how St. George cured his burns.\"\n\n\"There now! Think of that!\" said the nurse. \"And I never heard tell of\nthat cure, old as I am.\"\n\nBut Sabrinetta threw her arms round Elfin's neck, and held him as though\nshe would never let him go.\n\n\"Then it's all right, my dear, brave, precious Elfin,\" she cried, \"for I\nam a Princess, and you shall be my Prince. Come along, Nurse--don't wait\nto put on your bonnet. We'll go and be married this very moment.\"\n\nSo they went, and the pigs came after, moving in stately blackness, two\nby two. And, the minute he was married to the Princess, Elfin's hands\ngot quite well. And the people, who were weary of Prince Tiresome and\nhis hippopotamuses, hailed Sabrinetta and her husband as rightful\nSovereigns of the land.\n\n[\"They saw a cloud of steam.\" _See page 135._]\n\nNext morning the Prince and Princess went out to see if the dragon had\nbeen washed ashore. They could see nothing of him; but when they looked\nout toward the whirlpool they saw a cloud of steam; and the fishermen\nreported that the water for miles around was hot enough to shave with!\nAnd as the water is hot there to this day, we may feel pretty sure\nthat the fierceness of that dragon was such that all the waters of all\nthe sea were not enough to cool him. The whirlpool is too strong for him\nto be able to get out of it, so there he spins around and around forever\nand ever, doing some useful work at last, and warming the water for poor\nfisher-folk to shave with.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Prince and Princess rule the land well and wisely. The nurse lives\nwith them, and does nothing but fine sewing, and only that when she\nwants to very much. The Prince keeps no hippopotamuses, and is\nconsequently very popular. The five and seventy devoted pigs live in\nwhite marble sties with brass knockers and Pig on the doorplate, and are\nwashed twice a day with Turkish sponges and soap scented with violets,\nand no one objects to their following the Prince when he walks abroad,\nfor they behave beautifully, and always keep to the footpath, and obey\nthe notices about not walking on the grass. The Princess feeds them\nevery day with her own hands, and her first edict on coming to the\nthrone was that the word _pork_ should never be uttered on pain of\ndeath, and should, besides, be scratched out of all the dictionaries.\n\n\n\n\n[VIII\n\nKIND LITTLE EDMUND]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. Kind Little Edmund, or The Caves and the Cockatrice\n\n\nEdmund was a boy. The people who did not like him said that he was the\nmost tiresome boy that ever lived, but his grandmother and his other\nfriends said that he had an inquiring mind. And his granny often added\nthat he was the best of boys. But she was very kind and very old.\n\nEdmund loved to find out about things. Perhaps you will think that in\nthat case he was constant in his attendance at school, since there, if\nanywhere, we may learn whatever there is to be learned. But Edmund did\nnot want to learn things: He wanted to find things out, which is quite\ndifferent. His inquiring mind led him to take clocks to pieces to see\nwhat made them go, to take locks off doors to see what made them stick.\nIt was Edmund who cut open the India rubber ball to see what made it\nbounce, and he never did see, any more than you did when you tried the\nsame experiment.\n\nEdmund lived with his grandmother. She loved him very much, in spite of\nhis inquiring mind, and hardly scolded him at all when he frizzled up\nher tortoiseshell comb in his anxiety to find out whether it was made of\nreal tortoiseshell or of something that would burn. Edmund went to\nschool, of course, now and then, and sometimes he could not prevent\nhimself from learning something, but he never did it on purpose.\n\n\"It is such waste of time,\" said he. \"They only know what everybody\nknows. I want to find out new things that nobody has thought of but me.\"\n\n\"I don't think you're likely to find out anything that none of the wise\nmen in the whole world have thought of all these thousands of years,\"\nsaid Granny.\n\nBut Edmund did not agree with her. He played truant whenever he could,\nfor he was a kindhearted boy, and could not bear to think of a master's\ntime and labor being thrown away on a boy like himself--who did not wish\nto learn, only to find out--when there were so many worthy lads\nthirsting for instruction in geography and history and reading and\nciphering, and Mr. Smiles's \"Self-Help.\"\n\nOther boys played truant too, of course--and these went nutting or\nblackberrying or wild plum gathering, but Edmund never went on the side\nof the town where the green woods and hedges grew. He always went up the\nmountain where the great rocks were, and the tall, dark pine trees, and\nwhere other people were afraid to go because of the strange noises that\ncame out of the caves.\n\nEdmund was not afraid of these noises--though they were very strange and\nterrible. He wanted to find out what made them.\n\nOne day he did. He had invented, all by himself, a very ingenious and\nnew kind of lantern, made with a turnip and a tumbler, and when he took\nthe candle out of Granny's bedroom candlestick to put in it, it gave\nquite a splendid light.\n\nHe had to go to school next day, and he was caned for being absent\nwithout leave--although he very straightforwardly explained that he had\nbeen too busy making the lantern to have time to come to school.\n\nBut the day after he got up very early and took the lunch Granny had\nready for him to take to school--two boiled eggs and an apple\nturnover--and he took his lantern and went off as straight as a dart to\nthe mountains to explore the caves.\n\nThe caves were very dark, but his lantern lighted them up beautifully;\nand they were most interesting caves, with stalactites and stalagmites\nand fossils, and all the things you read about in the instructive books\nfor the young. But Edmund did not care for any of these things just\nthen. He wanted to find out what made the noises that people were afraid\nof, and there was nothing in the caves to tell him.\n\nPresently he sat down in the biggest cave and listened very carefully,\nand it seemed to him that he could distinguish three different sorts of\nnoises. There was a heavy rumbling sound, like a very large old\ngentleman asleep after dinner; and there was a smaller sort of rumble\ngoing on at the same time; and there was a sort of crowing, clucking\nsound, such as a chicken might make if it happened to be as big as a\nhaystack.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Edmund to himself, \"that the clucking is nearer\nthan the others.\" So he started up again and explored the caves once\nmore. He found out nothing, but about halfway up the wall of the cave,\nhe saw a hole. And, being a boy, he climbed up to it and crept in; and\nit was the entrance to a rocky passage. And now the clucking sounded\nmore plainly than before, and he could hardly hear the rumbling at all.\n\n\"I _am_ going to find out something at last,\" said Edmund, and on he\nwent. The passage wound and twisted, and twisted and turned, and turned\nand wound, but Edmund kept on.\n\n\"My lantern's burning better and better,\" said he presently, but the\nnext minute he saw that all the light did not come from his lantern. It\nwas a pale yellow light, and it shone down the passage far ahead of him\nthrough what looked like the chink of a door.\n\n\"I expect it's the fire in the middle of the earth,\" said Edmund, who\nhad not been able to help learning about that at school.\n\nBut quite suddenly the fire ahead gave a pale flicker and went down; and\nthe clucking ceased.\n\nThe next moment Edmund turned a corner and found himself in front of a\nrocky door. The door was ajar. He went in, and there was a round cave,\nlike the dome of St. Paul's. In the middle of the cave was a hole like a\nvery big hand-washing basin, and in the middle of the basin Edmund saw\na large pale person sitting.\n\nThis person had a man's face and a griffin's body, and big feathery\nwings, and a snake's tail, and a cock's comb and neck feathers.\n\n\"Whatever are you?\" said Edmund.\n\n\"I'm a poor starving cockatrice,\" answered the pale person in a very\nfaint voice, \"and I shall die--oh, I know I shall! My fire's gone out! I\ncan't think how it happened; I must have been asleep. I have to stir it\nseven times round with my tail once in a hundred years to keep it\nalight, and my watch must have been wrong. And now I shall die.\"\n\nI think I have said before what a kindhearted boy Edmund was.\n\n\"Cheer up,\" said he. \"I'll light your fire for you.\" And off he went,\nand in a few minutes he came back with a great armful of sticks from the\npine trees outside, and with these and a lesson book or two that he had\nforgotten to lose before, and which, quite by an oversight, were safe in\nhis pocket, he lit a fire all around the cockatrice. The wood blazed up,\nand presently something in the basin caught fire, and Edmund saw that it\nwas a sort of liquid that burned like the brandy in a snapdragon. And\nnow the cockatrice stirred it with his tail and flapped his wings in it\nso that some of it splashed out on Edmund's hand and burnt it rather\nbadly. But the cockatrice grew red and strong and happy, and its comb\ngrew scarlet, and its feathers glossy, and it lifted itself up and\ncrowed \"Cock-a-trice-a-doodle-doo!\" very loudly and clearly.\n\nEdmund's kindly nature was charmed to see the cockatrice so much\nimproved in health, and he said: \"Don't mention it; delighted, I'm\nsure,\" when the cockatrice began to thank him.\n\n\"But what can I do for you?\" said the creature.\n\n\"Tell me stories,\" said Edmund.\n\n\"What about?\" said the cockatrice.\n\n\"About true things that they don't know at school,\" said Edmund.\n\nSo the cockatrice began, and he told him about mines and treasures and\ngeological formations, and about gnomes and fairies and dragons, and\nabout glaciers and the Stone Age and the beginning of the world, and\nabout the unicorn and the phoenix, and about Magic, black and white.\n\nAnd Edmund ate his eggs and his turnover, and listened. And when he got\nhungry again he said good-bye and went home. But he came again the next\nday for more stories, and the next day, and the next, for a long time.\n\nHe told the boys at school about the cockatrice and his wonderful true\ntales, and the boys liked the stories; but when he told the master he\nwas caned for untruthfulness.\n\n\"But it's true,\" said Edmund. \"Just you look where the fire burnt my\nhand.\"\n\n\"I see you've been playing with fire--into mischief as usual,\" said the\nmaster, and he caned Edmund harder than ever. The master was ignorant\nand unbelieving: but I am told that some schoolmasters are not like\nthat.\n\nNow, one day Edmund made a new lantern out of something chemical that he\nsneaked from the school laboratory. And with it he went exploring again\nto see if he could find the things that made the other sorts of noises.\nAnd in quite another part of the mountain he found a dark passage, all\nlined with brass, so that it was like the inside of a huge telescope,\nand at the very end of it he found a bright green door. There was a\nbrass plate on the door that said MRS. D. KNOCK AND RING, and a white\nlabel that said CALL ME AT THREE. Edmund had a watch: It had been given\nto him on his birthday two days before, and he had not yet had time to\ntake it to pieces and see what made it go, so it was still going. He\nlooked at it now. It said a quarter to three.\n\nDid I tell you before what a kindhearted boy Edmund was? He sat down on\nthe brass doorstep and waited till three o'clock. Then he knocked and\nrang, and there was a rattling and puffing inside. The great door flew\nopen, and Edmund had only just time to hide behind it when out came an\nimmense yellow dragon, who wriggled off down the brass cave like a long,\nrattling worm--or perhaps more like a monstrous centipede.\n\nEdmund crept slowly out and saw the dragon stretching herself on the\nrocks in the sun, and he crept past the great creature and tore down the\nhill into the town and burst into school, crying out: \"There's a great\ndragon coming! Somebody ought to do something, or we shall all be\ndestroyed.\"\n\nHe was caned for untruthfulness without any delay. His master was never\none for postponing a duty.\n\n\"But it's true,\" said Edmund. \"You just see if it isn't.\"\n\nHe pointed out of the window, and everyone could see a vast yellow cloud\nrising up into the air above the mountain.\n\n\"It's only a thunder shower,\" said the master, and caned Edmund more\nthan ever. This master was not like some masters I know: He was very\nobstinate, and would not believe his own eyes if they told him anything\ndifferent from what he had been saying before his eyes spoke.\n\nSo while the master was writing _Lying is very wrong, and liars must be\ncaned. It is all for their own good_ on the black-board for Edmund to\ncopy out seven hundred times, Edmund sneaked out of school and ran for\nhis life across the town to warn his granny, but she was not at home. So\nthen he made off through the back door of the town, and raced up the\nhill to tell the cockatrice and ask for his help. It never occurred to\nhim that the cockatrice might not believe him. You see, he had heard so\nmany wonderful tales from him and had believed them all--and when you\nbelieve all a person's stories they ought to believe yours. This is only\nfair.\n\nAt the mouth of the cockatrice's cave Edmund stopped, very much out of\nbreath, to look back at the town. As he ran he had felt his little legs\ntremble and shake, while the shadows of the great yellow cloud fell upon\nhim. Now he stood once more between warm earth and blue sky, and looked\ndown on the green plain dotted with fruit trees and red-roofed farms\nand plots of gold corn. In the middle of that plain the gray town lay,\nwith its strong walls with the holes pierced for the archers, and its\nsquare towers with holes for dropping melted lead on the heads of\nstrangers; its bridges and its steeples; the quiet river edged with\nwillow and alder; and the pleasant green garden place in the middle of\nthe town, where people sat on holidays to smoke their pipes and listen\nto the band.\n\nEdmund saw it all; and he saw, too, creeping across the plain, marking\nher way by a black line as everything withered at her touch, the great\nyellow dragon--and he saw that she was many times bigger than the whole\ntown.\n\n\"Oh, my poor, dear granny,\" said Edmund, for he had a feeling heart, as\nI ought to have told you before.\n\nThe yellow dragon crept nearer and nearer, licking her greedy lips with\nher long red tongue, and Edmund knew that in the school his master was\nstill teaching earnestly and still not believing Edmund's tale the least\nlittle bit.\n\n\"He'll jolly well have to believe it soon, anyhow,\" said Edmund to\nhimself, and though he was a very tender-hearted boy--I think it only\nfair to tell you that he was this--I am afraid he was not as sorry as he\nought to have been to think of the way in which his master was going to\nlearn how to believe what Edmund said. Then the dragon opened her jaws\nwider and wider and wider. Edmund shut his eyes, for though his master\nwas in the town, the amiable Edmund shrank from beholding the awful\nsight.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes again there was no town--only a bare place where\nit had stood, and the dragon licking her lips and curling herself up to\ngo to sleep, just as Kitty does when she has quite finished with a\nmouse. Edmund gasped once or twice, and then ran into the cave to tell\nthe cockatrice.\n\n\"Well,\" said the cockatrice thoughtfully, when the tale had been told.\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"I don't think you quite understand,\" said Edmund gently. \"The dragon\nhas swallowed up the town.\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\" said the cockatrice.\n\n[\"Creeping across the plain.\" _See page 147._]\n\n\"But I live there,\" said Edmund blankly.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the cockatrice, turning over in the pool of fire to\nwarm its other side, which was chilly, because Edmund had, as usual,\nforgotten to close the cave door. \"You can live here with me.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I haven't made my meaning clear,\" said Edmund patiently.\n\"You see, my granny is in the town, and I can't bear to lose my granny\nlike this.\"\n\n\"I don't know what a granny may be,\" said the cockatrice, who seemed to\nbe growing weary of the subject, \"but if it's a possession to which you\nattach any importance----\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said Edmund, losing patience at last. \"Oh--do help\nme. What can I do?\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" said his friend, stretching itself out in the pool of\nflame so that the waves covered him up to his chin, \"I should find the\ndrakling and bring it here.\"\n\n\"But why?\" said Edmund. He had gotten into the habit of asking why at\nschool, and the master had always found it trying. As for the\ncockatrice, he was not going to stand that sort of thing for a moment.\n\n\"Oh, don't talk to me!\" he said, splashing angrily in the flames. \"I\ngive you advice; take it or leave it--I shan't bother about you anymore.\nIf you bring the drakling here to me, I'll tell you what to do next. If\nnot, not.\"\n\nAnd the cockatrice drew the fire up close around his shoulders, tucked\nhimself up in it, and went to sleep.\n\nNow this was exactly the right way to manage Edmund, only no one had\never thought of trying to do it before.\n\nHe stood for a moment looking at the cockatrice; the cockatrice looked\nat Edmund out of the corner of his eye and began to snore very loudly,\nand Edmund understood, once and for all, that the cockatrice wasn't\ngoing to put up with any nonsense. He respected the cockatrice very much\nfrom that moment, and set off at once to do exactly as he was told--for\nperhaps the first time in his life.\n\nThough he had played truant so often, he knew one or two things that\nperhaps you don't know, though you have always been so good and gone to\nschool regularly. For instance, he knew that a drakling is a dragon's\nbaby, and he felt sure that what he had to do was to find the third of\nthe three noises that people used to hear coming from the mountains. Of\ncourse, the clucking had been the cockatrice, and the big noise like a\nlarge gentleman asleep after dinner had been the big dragon. So the\nsmaller rumbling must have been the drakling.\n\nHe plunged boldly into the caves and searched and wandered and wandered\nand searched, and at last he came to a third door in the mountain, and\non it was written THE BABY IS ASLEEP. Just before the door stood fifty\npairs of copper shoes, and no one could have looked at them for a moment\nwithout seeing what sort of feet they were made for, for each shoe had\nfive holes in it for the drakling's five claws. And there were fifty\npairs because the drakling took after his mother, and had a hundred\nfeet--no more and no less. He was the kind called _Draco centipedis_ in\nthe learned books.\n\nEdmund was a good deal frightened, but he remembered the grim expression\nof the cockatrice's eye, and the fixed determination of his snore still\nrang in his ears, in spite of the snoring of the drakling, which was, in\nitself, considerable. He screwed up his courage, flung the door open,\nand called out: \"Hello, you drakling. Get out of bed this minute.\"\n\nThe drakling stopped snoring and said sleepily: \"It ain't time yet.\"\n\n\"Your mother says you are to, anyhow; and look sharp about it, what's\nmore,\" said Edmund, gaining courage from the fact that the drakling had\nnot yet eaten him.\n\nThe drakling sighed, and Edmund could hear it getting out of bed. The\nnext moment it began to come out of its room and to put on its shoes. It\nwas not nearly so big as its mother; only about the size of a Baptist\nchapel.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" said Edmund, as it fumbled clumsily with the seventeenth\nshoe.\n\n\"Mother said I was never to go out without my shoes,\" said the\ndrakling; so Edmund had to help it to put them on. It took some time,\nand was not a comfortable occupation.\n\nAt last the drakling said it was ready, and Edmund, who had forgotten to\nbe frightened, said, \"Come on then,\" and they went back to the\ncockatrice.\n\nThe cave was rather narrow for the drakling, but it made itself thin, as\nyou may see a fat worm do when it wants to get through a narrow crack in\na piece of hard earth.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Edmund, and the cockatrice woke up at once and asked\nthe drakling very politely to sit down and wait. \"Your mother will be\nhere presently,\" said the cockatrice, stirring up its fire.\n\nThe drakling sat down and waited, but it watched the fire with hungry\neyes.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" it said at last, \"but I am always accustomed to\nhaving a little basin of fire as soon as I get up, and I feel rather\nfaint. Might I?\"\n\nIt reached out a claw toward the cockatrice's basin.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the cockatrice sharply. \"Where were you brought\nup? Did they never teach you that 'we must not ask for all we see'? Eh?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the drakling humbly, \"but I am really _very_\nhungry.\"\n\nThe cockatrice beckoned Edmund to the side of the basin and whispered in\nhis ear so long and so earnestly that one side of the dear boy's hair\nwas quite burnt off. And he never once interrupted the cockatrice to ask\nwhy. But when the whispering was over, Edmund--whose heart, as I may\nhave mentioned, was very tender--said to the drakling: \"If you are\nreally hungry, poor thing, I can show you where there is plenty of\nfire.\" And off he went through the caves, and the drakling followed.\n\nWhen Edmund came to the proper place he stopped.\n\nThere was a round iron thing in the floor, like the ones the men shoot\nthe coals down into your cellar, only much larger. Edmund heaved it up\nby a hook that stuck out at one side, and a rush of hot air came up\nthat nearly choked him. But the drakling came close and looked down with\none eye and sniffed, and said: \"That smells good, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Edmund, \"well, that's the fire in the middle of the earth.\nThere's plenty of it, all done to a turn. You'd better go down and begin\nyour breakfast, hadn't you?\"\n\nSo the drakling wriggled through the hole, and began to crawl faster and\nfaster down the slanting shaft that leads to the fire in the middle of\nthe earth. And Edmund, doing exactly as he had been told, for a wonder,\ncaught the end of the drakling's tail and ran the iron hook through it\nso that the drakling was held fast. And it could not turn around and\nwriggle up again to look after its poor tail, because, as everyone\nknows, the way to the fires below is very easy to go down, but quite\nimpossible to come back on. There is something about it in Latin,\nbeginning: \"_Facilis descensus_.\"\n\nSo there was the drakling, fast by the silly tail of it, and there was\nEdmund very busy and important and very pleased with himself, hurrying\nback to the cockatrice.\n\n\"Now,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, now,\" said the cockatrice. \"Go to the mouth of the cave and laugh\nat the dragon so that she hears you.\"\n\nEdmund very nearly said \"Why?\" but he stopped in time, and instead,\nsaid: \"She won't hear me--\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said the cockatrice. \"No doubt you know best,\" and he\nbegan to tuck himself up again in the fire, so Edmund did as he was bid.\n\nAnd when he began to laugh his laughter echoed in the mouth of the cave\ntill it sounded like the laughter of a whole castleful of giants.\n\nAnd the dragon, lying asleep in the sun, woke up and said very crossly:\n\"What are you laughing at?\"\n\n[\"That smells good, eh?\" _See page 152._]\n\n\"At you,\" said Edmund, and went on laughing. The dragon bore it as long\nas she could, but, like everyone else, she couldn't stand being made fun\nof, so presently she dragged herself up the mountain very slowly,\nbecause she had just had a rather heavy meal, and stood outside and\nsaid, \"What are you laughing at?\" in a voice that made Edmund feel as if\nhe should never laugh again.\n\nThen the good cockatrice called out: \"At you! You've eaten your own\ndrakling--swallowed it with the town. Your own little drakling! He, he,\nhe! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nAnd Edmund found the courage to cry \"Ha, ha!\" which sounded like\ntremendous laughter in the echo of the cave.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the dragon. \"I _thought_ the town stuck in my throat\nrather. I must take it out, and look through it more carefully.\" And\nwith that she coughed--and choked--and there was the town, on the\nhillside.\n\nEdmund had run back to the cockatrice, and it had told him what to do.\nSo before the dragon had time to look through the town again for her\ndrakling, the voice of the drakling itself was heard howling miserably\nfrom inside the mountain, because Edmund was pinching its tail as hard\nas he could in the round iron door, like the one where the men pour the\ncoals out of the sacks into the cellar. And the dragon heard the voice\nand said: \"Why, whatever's the matter with Baby? He's not here!\" and\nmade herself thin, and crept into the mountain to find her drakling. The\ncockatrice kept on laughing as loud as it could, and Edmund kept on\npinching, and presently the great dragon--very long and narrow she had\nmade herself--found her head where the round hole was with the iron lid.\nHer tail was a mile or two off--outside the mountain. When Edmund heard\nher coming he gave one last nip to the drakling's tail, and then heaved\nup the lid and stood behind it, so that the dragon could not see him.\nThen he loosed the drakling's tail from the hook, and the dragon peeped\ndown the hole just in time to see her drakling's tail disappear down the\nsmooth, slanting shaft with one last squeak of pain. Whatever may have\nbeen the poor dragon's other faults, she was an excellent mother. She\nplunged headfirst into the hole, and slid down the shaft after her baby.\nEdmund watched her head go--and then the rest of her. She was so long,\nnow she had stretched herself thin, that it took all night. It was like\nwatching a goods train go by in Germany. When the last joint of her tail\nhad gone Edmund slammed down the iron door. He was a kindhearted boy, as\nyou have guessed, and he was glad to think that dragon and drakling\nwould now have plenty to eat of their favorite food, forever and ever.\nHe thanked the cockatrice for his kindness, and got home just in time to\nhave breakfast and get to school by nine. Of course, he could not have\ndone this if the town had been in its old place by the river in the\nmiddle of the plain, but it had taken root on the hillside just where\nthe dragon left it.\n\n\"Well,\" said the master, \"where were you yesterday?\"\n\nEdmund explained, and the master at once caned him for not speaking the\ntruth.\n\n\"But it _is_ true,\" said Edmund. \"Why, the whole town was swallowed by\nthe dragon. You know it was--\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the master. \"There was a thunderstorm and an\nearthquake, that's all.\" And he caned Edmund more than ever.\n\n\"But,\" said Edmund, who always would argue, even in the least favorable\ncircumstances, \"how do you account for the town being on the hillside\nnow, instead of by the river as it used to be?\"\n\n\"It was _always_ on the hillside,\" said the master. And all the class\nsaid the same, for they had more sense than to argue with a person who\ncarried a cane.\n\n\"But look at the maps,\" said Edmund, who wasn't going to be beaten in\nargument, whatever he might be in the flesh. The master pointed to the\nmap on the wall.\n\nThere was the town, on the hillside! And nobody but Edmund could see\nthat of course the shock of being swallowed by the dragon had upset all\nthe maps and put them wrong.\n\nAnd then the master caned Edmund again, explaining that this time it was\nnot for untruthfulness, but for his vexatious argumentative habits. This\nwill show you what a prejudiced and ignorant man Edmund's master\nwas--how different from the revered Head of the nice school where your\ngood parents are kind enough to send you.\n\nThe next day Edmund thought he would prove his tale by showing people\nthe cockatrice, and he actually persuaded some people to go into the\ncave with him; but the cockatrice had bolted himself in and would not\nopen the door--so Edmund got nothing by that except a scolding for\ntaking people on a wild-goose chase.\n\n\"A wild goose,\" said they, \"is nothing like a cockatrice.\"\n\nAnd poor Edmund could not say a word, though he knew how wrong they\nwere. The only person who believed him was his granny. But then she was\nvery old and very kind, and had always said he was the best of boys.\n\nOnly one good thing came of all this long story. Edmund has never been\nquite the same boy since. He does not argue quite so much, and he agreed\nto be apprenticed to a locksmith, so that he might one day be able to\npick the lock of the cockatrice's front door--and learn some more of the\nthings that other people don't know.\n\nBut he is quite an old man now, and he hasn't gotten that door open\nyet!\n",
