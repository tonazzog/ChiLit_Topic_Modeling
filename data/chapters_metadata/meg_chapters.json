Motherless\n\nIn the East End of London, more than a mile from St Paul's Cathedral,\nand lying near to the docks, there is a tangled knot of narrow streets\nand lanes, crossing and running into one another, with blind alleys and\ncourts leading out of them, and low arched passages, and dark gullies,\nand unsuspected slums, hiding away at the back of the narrowest\nstreets; forming altogether such a labyrinth of roads and dwellings,\nthat one needs a guide to thread a way among them, as upon pathless\nsolitudes or deserts of shifting sands.  In the wider streets it is\npossible for two conveyances to pass each other; for in some of them,\ntowards the middle of their length, a sweeping curve is taken out of\nthe causeway on either side to allow of this being done; but in the\nsmaller and closer streets there is room spared only for the passage to\nand fro of single carts, while here and there may be found an alley so\nnarrow that the neighbours can shake hands, if they would, from\nopposite windows.  Many of the houses are of three or four stories,\nwith walls, inside and out, dingy and grimed with smoke, and with\nwindows that scarcely admit even the gloomy light which finds a way\nthrough the thick atmosphere, and down between the high, close\nbuildings.\n\nA few years ago in one of these dismal streets there stood a still more\ndismal yard, bearing the name of Angel Court, as if there yet lingered\namong those grimy homes and their squalid occupants some memories of a\nbrighter place and of happier creatures.  Angel Court was about nine\nfeet wide, and contained ten or twelve houses on each side, with one\ndwelling at the further end, blocking up the thoroughfare, and\ncommanding a view down the close, stone-paved yard, with its\ninterlacing rows of clothes-lines stretched from window to window, upon\nwhich hung the yellow, half-washed rags of the inhabitants.  This end\nhouse was three stories high, without counting a raised roof of red\ntiles, forming two attics; the number of rooms in all being eight, each\none of which was held by a separate family, as were most of the other\nrooms in the court.  To possess two apartments was almost an\nundreamed-of luxury.\n\nThere was certainly an advantage in living in the attics of the end\nhouse in Angel Court, for the air was a trifle purer there and the\nlight clearer than in the stories below.  From the small windows might\nbe seen the prospect, not only of the narrow court, but of a vast\nextent of roofs, with a church spire here and there, and the glow of\nthe sky behind them, when the sun was setting in a thick purplish cloud\nof smoke and fog.  There was greater quiet also, and more privacy up in\nthe attics than beneath, where all day long people were trampling up\nand down the stairs, and past the doors of their neighbours' rooms.\nThe steep staircase ended in a steeper ladder leading up to the attics,\nand very few cared to climb up and down it.  It was perhaps for these\nreasons that the wife of a sailor, who had gone to sea eight months\nbefore, had chosen to leave a room lower down, for which he had paid\nthe rent in advance, in order to mount into higher and quieter quarters\nwith her three children.\n\nWhatever may have been her reason, it is certain that the sailor's\nwife, who had been ailing before her husband's departure, had, for some\nweeks past, been unable to descend the steep ladder into the maze of\nbusy streets, to buy the articles necessary for her little household,\nand that she had steadily refused all aid from her neighbours, who soon\nleft off pressing it upon her.  The only nurse she had, and the only\nperson to whom she would entrust her errands, was her eldest child, a\nsmall, spare, stunted girl of London growth, whose age could not be\nmore than ten years, though she wore the shrewd, anxious air of a woman\nupon her face, with deep lines wrinkling her forehead and puckering\nabout her keen eyes.  Her small bony hands were hard with work; and\nwhen she trod to and fro about the crowded room, from the bedside to\nthe fireplace, or from the crazy window to the creaking door, which let\nthe cold draughts blow in upon the ailing mother, her step was slow and\nsilent, less like that of a child than of a woman who was already weary\nwith much labour.  The room itself was not large enough to cause a\ngreat deal of work; but little Meg had had many nights of watching\nlately, and her eyes were heavy for want of sleep, with the dark\ncircles underneath them growing darker every day.\n\nThe evening had drawn in, but Meg's mother, her head propped up with\nanything that could be made into a pillow, had watched the last glow of\nthe light behind the chimneys and the church spires, and then she\nturned herself feebly towards the glimmer of a handful of coals burning\nin the grate, beside which her little daughter was undressing a baby\ntwelve months old, and hushing it to sleep in her arms.  Another child\nhad been put to bed already, upon a rude mattress in a corner of the\nroom, where she could not see him; but she watched Meg intently, with a\nstrange light in her dim eyes.  When the baby was asleep at last, and\nlaid down on the mattress upon the floor, the girl went softly back to\nthe fire, and stood for a minute or two looking thoughtfully at the red\nembers.\n\n'Little Meg!' said her mother, in a low, yet shrill voice.\n\nMeg stole across with a quiet step to the bedside, and fastened her\neyes earnestly upon her mother's face.\n\n'Do you know I'm going to die soon?' asked the mother.\n\n'Yes,' said Meg, and said no more.\n\n'Father'll be home soon,' continued her mother, 'and I want you to take\ncare of the children till he comes.  I've settled with Mr Grigg\ndownstairs as nobody shall meddle with you till father comes back.\nBut, Meg, you've got to take care of that your own self.  You've\nnothing to do with nobody, and let nobody have nothing to do with you.\nThey're a bad crew downstairs, a very bad crew.  Don't you ever let any\none of 'em come across the door-step.  Meg, could you keep a secret?'\n\n'Yes, I could,' said Meg.\n\n'I think you could,' answered her mother, 'and I'll tell you why you\nmustn't have nothing to do with the crew downstairs.  Meg, pull the big\nbox from under the bed.'\n\nThe box lay far back, where it was well hidden by the bed; but by dint\nof hard pulling Meg dragged it out, and the sailor's wife gave her the\nkey from under her pillow.  When the lid was open, the eyes of the\ndying woman rested with interest and longing upon the faded finery it\ncontained--the bright-coloured shawl, and showy dress, and velvet\nbonnet, which she used to put on when she went to meet her husband on\nhis return from sea.  Meg lifted them out carefully one by one, and\nlaid them on the bed, smoothing out the creases fondly.  There were her\nown best clothes, too, and the children's; the baby's nankeen coat, and\nRobin's blue cap, which never saw the light except when father was at\nhome.  She had nearly emptied the box, when she came upon a small but\nheavy packet.\n\n'That's the secret, Meg,' said her mother in a cautious whisper.\n'That's forty gold sovereigns, as doesn't belong to me, nor father\nneither, but to one of his mates as left it with him for safety.  I\ncouldn't die easy if I thought it wouldn't be safe.  They'd go rooting\nabout everywhere; but, Meg, you must never, never, never let anybody\ncome into the room till father's at home.'\n\n'I never will, mother,' said little Meg.\n\n'That's partly why I moved up here,' she continued.  'Why, they'd\nmurder you all if they couldn't get the money without.  Always keep the\ndoor locked, whether you're in or out; and, Meg dear, I've made you a\nlittle bag to wear round your neck, to keep the key of the box in, and\nall the money I've got left; it'll be enough till father comes.  And if\nanybody meddles, and asks you when he's coming, be sure say you expect\nhim home to-day or to-morrow.  He'll be here in four weeks, on Robin's\nbirthday, may be.  Do you know all you've got to do, little Meg?'\n\n'Yes,' she answered.  'I'm to take care of the children, and the money\nas belongs to one of father's mates; and I must wear the little bag\nround my neck, and always keep the door locked, and tell folks I expect\nfather home to-day or to-morrow, and never let nobody come into our\nroom.'\n\n'That's right,' murmured the dying woman.  'Meg, I've settled all about\nmy burial with the undertaker and Mr Grigg downstairs; and you'll have\nnothing to do but stay here till they take me away.  If you like, you\nand Robin and baby may walk after me; but be sure see everybody out,\nand lock the door safe afore you start.'\n\nShe lay silent for some minutes, touching one after another the clothes\nspread upon the bed as Meg replaced them in the box, and then, locking\nit, put the key into the bag, and hung it round her neck.\n\n'Little Meg,' said her mother, 'do you remember one Sunday evening us\nhearing a sermon preached in the streets?'\n\n'Yes, mother,' answered Meg promptly.\n\n'What was it he said so often?' she whispered.  'You learnt the verse\nonce at school.'\n\n'I know it still,' said Meg.  '\"If ye then, being evil, know how to\ngive good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your Father\nwhich is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"'\n\n'Ay, that's it,' she said faintly; 'and he said we needn't wait to be\nGod's children, but we were to ask Him for good things at once, because\nHe had sent His own Son to be our Saviour, and to die for us.  \"Them\nthat ask Him, them that ask Him\"; he said it over and over again.  Eh!\nbut I've asked Him a hundred times to let me live till father comes\nhome, or to let me take baby along with me.'\n\n'May be that isn't a good thing,' said Meg.  'God knows what are good\nthings.'\n\nThe dying mother pondered over these words for some time, until a\nfeeble smile played upon her wan face.\n\n'It 'ud be a good thing anyhow,' she said, 'to ask Him to forgive me my\nsins, and take me to heaven when I die--wouldn't it, Meg?'\n\n'Yes, that's sure to be a good thing,' answered Meg thoughtfully.\n\n'Then I'll ask Him for that all night,' said her mother, 'and to be\nsure take care of you all till father comes back.  That 'ud be another\ngood thing.'\n\nShe turned her face round to the wall with a deep sigh, and closed her\neyelids, but her lips kept moving silently from time to time.  Meg\ncried softly to herself in her chair before the fire, but presently she\ndozed a little for very heaviness of heart, and dreamed that her\nfather's ship was come into dock, and she, and her mother, and the\nchildren were going down the dingy streets to meet him.  She awoke with\na start; and creeping gently to her mother's side, laid her warm little\nhand upon hers.  It was deadly cold, with a chill such as little Meg\nhad never before felt; and when her mother neither moved nor spoke in\nanswer to her repeated cries, she knew that she was dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Little Meg as a Mourner\n\nFor the next day, and the night following, the corpse of the mother lay\nsilent and motionless in the room where her three children were living.\nMeg cried bitterly at first; but there was Robin to be comforted, and\nthe baby to be played with when it laughed and crowed in her face.\nRobin was nearly six years old, and had gained a vague, dim knowledge\nof death by having followed, with a troop of other curious children,\nmany a funeral that had gone out from the dense and dirty dwellings to\nthe distant cemetery, where he had crept forward to the edge of the\ngrave, and peeped down into what seemed to him a very dark and dreadful\ndepth.  When little Meg told him mother was dead, and lifted him up to\nkneel on the bedside and kiss her icy lips for the last time, his\nchildish heart was filled with an awe which almost made him shrink from\nthe sight of that familiar face, scarcely whiter or more sunken now\nthan it had been for many a day past.  But the baby stroked the quiet\ncheeks, whilst chuckling and kicking in Meg's arms, and shouted, 'Mam!\nmam! mam!' until she caught it away, and pressing it tightly to her\nbosom, sat down on the floor by the bed, weeping.\n\n'You've got no mam but me now, baby,' cried little Meg.  She sat still\nfor a while, with Robin lying on the ground beside her, his face hidden\nin her ragged frock; but the baby set up a pitiful little wail, and she\nput aside her own grief to soothe it.\n\n'Hush! hush!' sang Meg, getting up, and walking with baby about the\nroom.  'Hush, hush, my baby dear!  By-by, my baby, by-by!'\n\nMeg's sorrowful voice sank into a low, soft, sleepy tone, and presently\nthe baby fell fast asleep, when she laid it upon Robin's little\nmattress, and covered it up gently with an old shawl.  Robin was\nstanding at the foot of the bed, gazing at his mother with wide-open,\ntearless eyes; and little Meg softly drew the sheet again over the pale\nand rigid face.\n\n'Robbie,' she said, 'let's sit in the window a bit.'\n\nThey had to climb up to the narrow window-sill by a broken chair which\nstood under it; but when they were there, and Meg had her arm round\nRobin, to hold him safe, they could see down into Angel Court, and into\nthe street beyond, with its swarms of busy and squalid people.  Upon\nthe stone pavement far below them a number of children of every age and\nsize, but all ill-clothed and ill-fed, were crawling about, in and out\nof the houses, and their cries and shrieks came up to them in their\nlofty seat; but of late their mother had not let them run out to play\nin the streets, and they were mostly strangers to them except by sight.\nNow and then Meg and Robin cast a glance inwards at the quiet and still\nform of their mother, lying as if silently watching them with her\nhalf-closed eyes, and when they spoke to one another they spoke in\nwhispers.\n\n'Mother is going to live with the angels,' said Meg.\n\n'What are angels?' asked Robin, his glittering black eyes glancing at\nthe bed where she lay in her deep sleep.\n\n'Oh, I'm not quite sure,' answered Meg.  'Only they're beautiful\npeople, who are always white and clean, and shining, like that big\nwhite cloud up in the sky.  They live somewhere up in the sky, where\nit's always sunny, and bright, and blue.'\n\n'How 'll mother get up there?' inquired Robin.\n\n'Well, I suppose,' replied Meg, after some reflection, 'after they've\nput her in the ground, the angels 'll come and take her away.  I read\nonce of a poor beggar, oh such a poor beggar! full of sores, and he\ndied, and the angels carried him away somewhere.  I thought, may be,\nthey'd come for mother in the night; but I suppose they let people be\nburied first now, and fetch 'em away after.'\n\n'I should like to see some angels,' said Robin.\n\nThey were silent again after that, looking down upon the quarrelling\nchildren, and the drunken men and women staggering about the yard\nbelow.  Now and then a sharper scream rang through the court, as some\nangry mother darted out to cuff one or another of the brawling groups,\nor to yell some shrill reproach at the drunken men.  No sound came to\nthe ears of the listening children except the din and jarring tumult of\nthe crowded city; but they could see the white clouds floating slowly\nacross the sky over their heads, which seemed to little Meg like the\nwings of the waiting angels, hovering over the place where her mother\nlay dead.\n\n'Meg,' said Robin, 'why do they call this Angel Court?  Did the angels\nuse to live here?'\n\n'I don't think they ever could,' she answered sadly, 'or it must have\nbeen a long, long time ago.  Perhaps they can't come here now, so\nthey're waiting for mother to be taken out to the burying-ground afore\nthey can carry her up to the sky.  May be that's it.'\n\n'Meg,' whispered Robin, pressing closer to her side, 'what's the devil?'\n\n'Oh, I don't know,' cried Meg; 'only he's dreadfully, dreadfully\nwicked.'\n\n'As wicked as father is when he's drunk?' asked Robin.\n\n'Oh, a hundred million times wickeder,' answered Meg eagerly.  'Father\ndoesn't get drunk often; and you mustn't be a naughty boy and talk\nabout it.'\n\nIt was already a point of honour with little Meg to throw a cloak over\nher father's faults; and she spoke so earnestly that Robin was strongly\nimpressed by it.  He asked no more questions for some time.\n\n'Meg,' he said at last, 'does the devil ever come here?'\n\n'I don't think he does,' answered Meg, with a shrewd shake of her small\nhead; 'I never see him, never.  Folks are bad enough without him, I\nguess.  No, no; you needn't be frightened of seeing him, Robbie.'\n\n'I wish there wasn't any devil,' said Robin.\n\n'I wish everybody in London was good,' said Meg.\n\nThey sat a while longer on the window-sill, watching the sparrows, all\nfluffy and black, fluttering and chattering upon the house-tops, and\nthe night fog rising from the unseen river, and hiding the tall masts,\nwhich towered above the buildings.  It was dark already in the court\nbelow; and here and there a candle had been lit and placed in a window,\ncasting a faint twinkle of light upon the gloom.  The baby stirred, and\ncried a little; and Meg lifted Robin down from his dangerous seat, and\nput two or three small bits of coal upon the fire, to boil up the\nkettle for their tea.  She had done it often before, at the bidding of\nher mother; but it seemed different now.  Mother's voice was silent,\nand Meg had to think of everything herself.  Soon after tea was over\nshe undressed Robin and the baby, who soon fell asleep again; and when\nall her work was over, and the fire put out, little Meg crept in beside\nthem on the scanty mattress, with her face turned towards the bed, that\nshe might see the angels if they came to carry her mother away.  But\nbefore long her eyelids drooped over her drowsy eyes, and, with her arm\nstretched lightly across both her children, she slept soundly till\ndaybreak.\n\nNo angels had come in the night; but early in the morning a\nneighbouring undertaker, with two other men, and Mr Grigg, the\nlandlord, who lived on the ground-floor, carried away the light burden\nof the coffin which contained Meg's mother.  She waited until all were\ngone, and then she locked the door carefully, and with baby in her\narms, and Robin holding by her frock, she followed the funeral at a\ndistance, and with difficulty, through the busy streets.  The brief\nburial service was ended before they reached the cemetery, but Meg was\nin time to show Robin the plate upon the coffin before the grave-digger\nshovelled down great spadefuls of earth upon it.  They stood watching,\nwith sad but childish curiosity, till all was finished; and then Meg,\nwith a heavy and troubled heart, took them home again to their lonely\nattic in Angel Court.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Little Meg's Cleaning Day\n\nFor a few days Meg kept up closely in her solitary attic, playing with\nRobin and tending baby; only leaving them for a few necessary minutes,\nto run to the nearest shop for bread or oatmeal.  Two or three of the\nneighbours took the trouble to climb the ladder, and try the latch of\nthe door, but they always found it locked; and if Meg answered at all,\nshe did so only with the door between them, saying she was getting on\nvery well, and she expected father home to-day or to-morrow.  When she\nwent in and out on her errands, Mr Grigg, a gruff, surly man, who kept\neverybody about him in terror, did not break his promise to her mother,\nthat he would let no one meddle with her; and very quickly the brief\ninterest of Angel Court in the three motherless children of the absent\nsailor died away into complete indifference, unmingled with curiosity:\nfor everybody knew the full extent of their neighbours' possessions;\nand the poor furniture of Meg's room, where the box lay well hidden and\nunsuspected under the bedstead, excited no covetous desires.  The\ntenant of the back attic, a girl whom Meg herself had seen no oftener\nthan once or twice, was away on a visit of six weeks, having been\ncommitted to a House of Correction for being drunk and disorderly in\nthe streets; so that by the close of the week in which the sailor's\nwife died no foot ascended or descended the ladder, except that of\nlittle Meg.\n\nThere were two things Meg set her heart upon doing before father came\nhome: to teach Robin his letters, and baby to walk alone.  Robin was a\nquick, bright boy, and was soon filled with the desire to surprise his\nfather by his new accomplishment; and Meg and he laboured diligently\ntogether over the Testament, which had been given to her at a night\nschool, where she had herself learned to read a little.  But with the\nbaby it was quite another thing.  There were babies in the court, not\nto be compared with Meg's baby in other respects, who, though no older,\ncould already crawl about the dirty pavement and down into the gutter,\nand who could even toddle unsteadily, upon their little bare feet, over\nthe stone flags.  Meg felt it as a sort of reproach upon her, as a\nnurse, to have her baby so backward.  But the utmost she could prevail\nupon it to do was to hold hard and fast by a chair, or by Robin's fist,\nand gaze across the great gulf which separated her from Meg and the\npiece of bread and treacle stretched out temptingly towards her.  It\nwas a wan, sickly baby with an old face, closely resembling Meg's own,\nand meagre limbs, which looked as though they would never gain strength\nenough to bear the weight of the puny body; but from time to time a\nsmile kindled suddenly upon the thin face, and shone out of the serious\neyes--a smile so sweet, and unexpected, and fleeting, that Meg could\nonly rush at her, and catch her in her arms, thinking there was not\nsuch another baby in the world.  This was the general conclusion to\nMeg's efforts to teach her to walk, but none the less she put her\nthrough the same course of training a dozen times a day.\n\nSometimes, when her two children were asleep, little Meg climbed up to\nthe window-sill and sat there alone, watching the stars come out in\nthat sky where her mother was gone to live.  There were nights when the\nfog was too thick for her to see either them or the many glittering\nspecks made by the lamps in the maze of streets around her; and then\nshe seemed to herself to be dwelling quite alone with Robin and baby,\nin some place cut off both from the sky above and the earth beneath.\nBut by-and-by, as she taught Robin out of the Testament, and read in it\nherself two or three times a day, new thoughts of God and His life came\nto her mind, upon which she pondered, after her childish fashion, as\nshe sat in the dark, looking out over the great vast city with its\nmyriads of fellow-beings all about her, none of whom had any knowledge\nof her loneliness, or any sympathy with her difficulties.\n\nAfter a week was past, Meg and her children made a daily expedition\ndown to the docks, lingering about in any out-of-the-way corner till\nthey could catch sight of some good-natured face, which threatened no\nunkind rebuff, and then Meg asked when her father's ship would come in.\nVery often she could get no satisfactory answer, but whenever she came\nacross any one who knew the Ocean King, she heard that it would most\nlikely be in dock by the end of October.  Robin's birthday was the last\nday in October, so her mother's reckoning had been correct.  Father\nwould be home on Robbie's birthday; yet none the less was Meg's anxious\nface to be seen day after day about the docks, seeking someone to tell\nher over again the good news.\n\nThe last day but one arrived, and Meg set about the scrubbing and the\ncleaning of the room heartily, as she had seen her mother do before her\nfather's return.  Robin was set upon the highest chair, with baby on\nhis lap, to look on at Meg's exertions, out of the way of the wet\nflooring, upon which she bestowed so much water that the occupant of\nthe room below burst out upon the landing, with such a storm of threats\nand curses as made her light heart beat with terror.  When the cleaning\nof the room was done, she trotted up and down the three flights of\nstairs with a small can, until she had filled, as full as it would\nhold, a broken tub, which was to serve as a bath for Robin and baby.\nIt was late in the evening when all was accomplished, and Meg looked\naround her with a glow of triumph on the clean room and the fresh faces\nof the children.  Very weary she felt, but she opened her Testament, in\nwhich she had not had time to give Robin a lesson that day, and she\nread a verse half aloud to herself.\n\n'Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give\nyou rest.'\n\n'I wish I could go to Jesus,' sighed little Meg, 'for I've worked very\nhard all day; and He says He'd give me rest.  Only I don't know where\nto go.'\n\nShe laid her head down on the pillow beside the baby's slumbering face,\nand almost before it rested there a deep sleep had come.  Perhaps Meg's\nsigh had gone to Jesus, and it was He who gave her rest; 'for so He\ngiveth His beloved sleep.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Little Meg's Treat to Her Children\n\nRobin's birthday dawned brightly, even into the dark deep shadows of\nAngel Court, and Meg was awakened by the baby's two hands beating upon\nher still drowsy face, and trying to lift up her closed eyelids with\nits tiny fingers.  She sprang up with a light heart, for father was\ncoming home to-day.  For the first time since her mother's death she\ndragged the box from under the bed, and with eager hands unlocked the\nlid.  She knew that she dare not cross the court, she and the children,\narrayed in the festive finery, without her father to take care of them;\nfor she had seen other children stripped of all their new and showy\nclothes before they could reach the shelter of the larger streets.\n\nBut Meg was resolved that Robin and baby at least should not meet their\nfather in rags.  She took out the baby's coat and hood, too small now\neven for the little head it was to cover, and Robin's blue cap and\nbrown holland pinafore.  These things she made up into a bundle,\nlooking longingly at her own red frock, and her bonnet with green\nribbons: but Meg shook her head at herself admonishingly.  It never\nwould do to risk an appearance in such gorgeous attire.  The very\nutmost she could venture upon was to put some half-worn shoes on her\nown feet and Robin's; for shoes were not in fashion for the children of\nAngel Court, and the unusual sound of their tread would attract quite\nas much attention as little Meg dare risk.  She dressed her children\nand set them on the bed, while she put her own rough hair as smooth as\nshe could by a little glass in the lid of the trunk.  Her bonnet, which\nhad originally belonged to her mother, had been once of black silk, but\nit was now brown with years, and the old shawl she pinned over the\nragged bodice of her frock was very thin and torn at the edges; but\nMeg's heart was full of hope, and nothing could drive away the smile\nfrom her careworn face this morning.  With the baby in her arms she\ncarefully descended the ladder, having put the door-key into the bag\nround her neck along with the key of the box and her last half-crown.\nThen with stealthy steps she stole along under the houses, hushing\nRobin, who was inclined to make an unnecessary clatter in his shoes;\nbut fortunately the inhabitants of Angel Court were not early risers,\nand Meg was off in good time, so they reached the outer streets safely,\nwithout notice or attack.  Before going down to the docks Meg drew\nRobin into an empty archway, and there exchanged his ragged cap and\npinafore for those she had put up into her bundle.  Having dressed the\nbaby also, she sat and looked at them both for a minute in mute\nadmiration and delight.  There could not be a prettier boy than Robin\nin all London, she was sure, with his bright black eyes and curly hair,\nthat twisted so tightly round her fingers.  As for the baby with her\nshrewd old-womanish face, and the sweet smile which spoke a good deal\nplainer than words, Meg could scarcely keep from kissing her all the\ntime.  How pleased and proud father would be!  But when she remembered\nhow she should have to tell him that mother was dead and buried, and\nnone of them would ever see her again, Meg's eyes were blinded with\ntears, and hiding her face in the baby's neck, she cried, whether for\njoy or sorrow she could hardly tell; until Robin broke out into a loud\nwail of distress and terror, which echoed noisily under the low vault\nof the archway.\n\nLittle Meg roused herself at the sound of Robin's cry, and taking his\nhand in hers, with the baby upon her arm, she loitered about the\nentrance to the dockyard, till a good-tempered looking burly man came\nnear to them.  Meg planted herself bravely in his way, and looked up\nwistfully into his red face.\n\n'Please, sir,' she said, 'could you tell me if father's ship's come in\nyet?'\n\n'Father's ship!' repeated the man in a kindly voice.  'Why, what's the\nname of father's ship?'\n\n'The Ocean King,' said Meg, trembling.\n\n'It's in the river, my little lass,' he said, 'but it won't be in dock\ntill night.  Father can't be at home afore to-morrow morning at the\nsoonest.'\n\n'Thank you kindly, sir,' answered Meg, her voice faltering with her\ngreat joy.  Her task was ended, then.  To-morrow she would give up the\nkey of the box with its secret treasure, which she hardly dared to\nthink about, and then she could feel like a child once more.  She did\nfeel almost as gay as Robin who was pattering and stamping proudly\nalong in his shoes, and in the consciousness that it was his birthday.\nNobody else had such a thing as a birthday, so far as he knew;\ncertainly none of his acquaintances in Angel Court, not even Meg\nherself, for Meg's birthday was lost in the depth of the ten years\nwhich had passed over her head.  He scarcely knew what it was, for he\ncould neither see it nor touch it; but he had it, for Meg told him so,\nand it made him feel glad and proud.  It was a bright, warm, sunny\nautumn day, with enough freshness in the breeze coming off the unseen\nriver to make the air sweet and reviving; for Meg was skirting about\nthe more open streets, without venturing to pass through the closer and\ndirtier alleys.\n\n'Robbie,' she said after a time, when they had come to a halt upon the\nsteps of a dwelling-house, 'Robbie, I'll give you a treat to-day,\nbecause it's your birthday.  We'll not go home till it's dark; and I'll\ntake you to see Temple Gardens.'\n\n'What are Temple Gardens?' demanded Robin, his eyes eager for an answer.\n\n'Oh, you'll see,' said Meg, not quite able to explain herself.  'I went\nthere once, ever so many years ago, when I was a little girl.  You'll\nlike 'em ever so!'\n\n'Do we know the road?' asked Robin doubtfully.\n\n'I should think so!' replied Meg; 'and if we didn't, there's the\npolice.  What's the police good for, if they couldn't tell a person\nlike me the road to Temple Gardens?  We'll have such a nice day!'\n\nThe children trotted along briskly till they reached the broad\nthoroughfares and handsome shops of the main streets which traverse\nLondon, where a constant rush of foot passengers upon the pavement, and\nof conveyances in the roadway, hurry to and fro from morning to\nmidnight.  Poor little Meg stood for a few minutes aghast and stunned,\nalmost fearful of committing herself and her children to the mighty\nstream; but Robin pulled her on impatiently.  He had been once as far\nas the Mansion House, before the time when their mother's long illness\nhad made them almost prisoners in their lonely attic; and Meg herself\nhad wandered several times as far as the great church of St Paul.\nAfter the first dread was over, she found a trembling, anxious\nenjoyment in the sight of the shops, and of the well-dressed people in\nthe streets.  At one of the windows she was arrested by a full-size\nvision of herself, and Robin, and the baby, reflected in a great glass,\na hundred times larger than the little square in the box-lid at home.\nShe could not quite keep down a sigh after her own red frock and best\nbonnet; but she comforted herself quickly with the thought that people\nwould look upon her as the nurse of Robin and baby, sent out to take\nthem a walk.\n\nThey did not make very rapid progress, for they stopped to look in at\nmany shop windows, especially where there were baby-clothes for sale,\nor where there were waxen figures of little boys, life-size, dressed in\nthe newest fashions, with large eyes of glass beads, not unlike Robin's\nown black ones.  The passage of the crossings was also long and\nperilous.  Meg ran first with the baby, and put her down safely on the\nother side in some corner of a doorway; then with a sinking and\ntroubled heart, least any evil person should pick her up, and run away\nwith her as a priceless treasure, she returned for Robin.  In this way\nshe got over several crossings, until they reached the bottom of\nLudgate Hill, where she stood shivering and doubting for a long time,\ntill she fairly made up her mind to speak to the majestic policeman\nlooking on calmly at the tumult about him.\n\n'Oh, if you please, Mr Police,' said Meg, in a plaintive voice, 'I want\nto get these two little children over to the other side, and I don't\nknow how to do it, except you'd please to hold baby while I take Robbie\nacross.'\n\nThe policeman looked down from his great height, without bending his\nstiff neck, upon the childish creature who spoke to him, and Meg's\nspirit sank with the fear of being ordered back again.  But he picked\nup Robin under his arm, and bidding her keep close beside him, he\nthreaded his way through the throng of carriages.  This was the last\ndanger; and now with restored gaiety Meg travelled on with her two\nchildren.\n\n[The policeman picked up Robin under his arm, and\nthreaded his way through the throng of carriages.]\n\nBy-and-by they turned from the busy Fleet Street under a low archway,\nand in a minute they were out of the thunder of the streets which had\nalmost drowned their voices, and found themselves in a place so quiet\nand so calm, with a sort of grave hush in the very air, that Robin\npressed close to Meg's side, with something of the silent and subdued\nawe with which he might have entered a church.  There were houses here,\nand courts, but not houses and courts like those from which they had\ncome.  Here and there they came upon a long corridor, where the sun\nshone between the shadows of the pillars supporting the roof; and they\nlooked along them with wondering eyes, not knowing where they could\nlead to, and too timid to try to find out.  It was not a deserted\nplace, but the number of people passing to and fro were few enough to\nmake it seem almost a solitude to these poor children, who had\ntravelled hither from the over-crowded slums of the East End.  They\ncould hear their own voices, when they spoke, ring out in such clear,\nechoing tones, that Meg hushed Robin, lest some of the grave, stern,\nthoughtful gentlemen who passed them should bid them begone, and leave\nthe Temple to its usual stillness.  The houses seemed to them so large\nand grand, that Meg, who had heard once of the Queen, and had a dim\nnotion of her as a lady of extraordinary greatness and grandeur,\nwhispered to Robin confidentially that she thought the Queen must live\nhere.\n\nThey came upon a fountain in the centre of a small plot of grass and\nflowers, enclosed within high railings; and Robin uttered a shrill cry\nof delight, which rang noisily through the quiet court where its waters\nplayed in the sunshine.  But at last they discovered, with hearts as\neagerly throbbing as those of the explorers of some new country, the\ngardens, the real Temple Gardens!  The chrysanthemums were in full\nblossom, with all their varied tints, delicate and rich, glowing under\nthe brightness of the noontide sun; and Robin and Meg stood still,\ntransfixed and silent, too full of an excess of happiness to speak.\n\n'Oh, Meg, what is it? what is it?' cried Robin at last, with\noutstretched hands, as if he would fain gather them all into his arms.\n'Is it gardens, Meg?  Is this Temple Gardens?'\n\nMeg could not answer at first, but she held Robin back from the\nflowers.  She did not feel quite at home in this strange, sweet, sunny\nplace; and she peeped in cautiously through the half-open iron gate\nbefore entering.  There were a few other children there, with their\nnursemaids, but she felt there was some untold difference between her\nand them.  But Robin's delight had given him courage, and he rushed in\ntumultuously, running along the smooth walks in an ecstasy of joy; and\nMeg could do nothing else but follow.  Presently, as nobody took any\nnotice of her, she gave herself up to the gladness of the hour, and\ntoiled up and down, under the weight of the baby, wherever Robin wished\nto go, until he consented to rest a little while upon a seat which\nfaced the river, where they could see the boats pass by.  This was the\nhappiest moment to Meg.  She thought of her father's ship coming up the\nriver, bringing him home to her and the children; and she had almost\nlost the recollection of where she was, when Robin, who had been very\nquiet for some time, pulled her by the shawl.\n\n'Look, Meg,' he whispered.\n\nHe pointed to a seat not far from them, where sat a lady, in a bright\nsilk dress, and a velvet bonnet with a long rich feather across it.\nThere were two children with her, a girl of Meg's age, and a boy about\nas big as Robin, dressed like a little Highlander, with a kilt of many\ncolours, and a silver-mounted pouch, and a dirk, which he was\nbrandishing about before his mother, who looked on, laughing fondly and\nproudly at her boy.  Meg gazed, too, until she heard Robin sob, and\nturning quickly to him, she saw the tears rolling quickly down his\nsorrowful face.  'Nobody laughs to me, Meg,' said Robin.\n\n'Oh yes, Robbie, I laugh to you,' cried Meg; 'and father 'll laugh when\nhe comes home to-morrow; and maybe God laughs to us, only we can't see\nHis face.'\n\n'I'd like to go home,' sobbed Robin; and Meg took her baby upon her\ntired arm, and turned her steps eastward once more.  As they left\nTemple Gardens, languid and weary, Meg saw the friendly man who had\nspoken kindly to them that morning at the docks passing by in an empty\ndray, and meeting her wistful eyes, he pulled up for a minute.\n\n'Hullo, little woman!' he shouted.  'Are you going my way?'\n\nHe pointed his whip towards St Paul's, and Meg nodded, for her voice\ncould not have reached him through the din.\n\n'Hoist them children up here, that's a good fellow,' he said to a man\nwho was standing by idle; and in a few seconds more they were riding\ntriumphantly along Fleet Street in such a thrill and flutter of delight\nas Meg's heart had never felt before, while Robin forgot his sorrows,\nand cheered on the horses with all the power of his shrill voice.  The\ndray put them down at about half a mile from Angel Court, while it was\nstill broad daylight, and Robin was no longer tired.  Meg changed her\nlast half-crown, and spent sixpence of it lavishly in the purchase of\nsome meat pies, upon which they feasted sumptuously, in the shelter of\na doorway leading to the back of a house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Little Meg's Neighbour\n\nWhen their feast was over, the children sauntered on slowly, not\nwishing to enter Angel Court till it was dark enough for Robin's and\nbaby's finery to pass by unseen; but as soon as it was dark they turned\nout of the main thoroughfare into the dingy streets more familiar to\nthem.  As they entered the house Meg heard the deep gruff voice of Mr\nGrigg calling to her, and she went into his room, trembling, and\nholding the baby very tightly in her arms.  It was a small room, the\nsame size as their own attic, and the litter and confusion throughout\nmade it impossible to go in more than a step or two.  Mr Grigg was\nseated at a stained wooden table, upon which stood two large cups and a\nblack bottle of gin, with a letter lying near to Mr Grigg's large and\nshaking hand.  Coming in from the fresh air of the night, Meg coughed a\nlittle with the mingled fumes of gin and tobacco; but she coughed\nsoftly for fear of giving offence.\n\n'Here's a letter come for your mother, little Meg,' said Mr Grigg,\nseizing it eagerly, 'I'll read it to you if you like.'\n\n'Oh no, thank you, sir,' answered Meg quickly; 'father's coming home,\nand he'll read it to-morrow morning.  His ship's in the river, and\nit'll be in dock to-night for certain.  So he'll be home to-morrow.'\n\nUpon hearing this news Mr Grigg thought it best to deliver up the\nletter to Meg, but he did it so reluctantly that she hurried away lest\nhe should reclaim it.  Robin was already halfway upstairs, but she soon\novertook him, and a minute afterwards reached their own door.  She was\nabout to put the baby down to take out the key, when, almost without\nbelieving her own eyes, she saw that it was in the lock, and that a\ngleam of firelight shone through the chinks of the door.  Meg lifted\nthe latch with a beating heart, and looked in before venturing to\nenter.  The fire was lighted, but there seemed to be no other\ndisturbance or change in the attic since the morning, except that in\nher mother's low chair upon the hearth there sat a thin slight woman,\nlike her mother, with the head bowed down, and the face hidden in the\nhands.  Meg paused, wonder-stricken and speechless, on the door-sill;\nbut Robin ran forward quickly, with a glad shout of 'Mother! mother!'\n\nAt the sound of Robin's step and cry the woman lifted up her face.  It\nwas a white, thin face, but younger than their mother's, though the\neyes were red and sunken, as if with many tears, and there was a gloom\nupon it, as if it had never smiled a happy smile.  Meg knew it in an\ninstant as the face of the tenant of the back attic, who had been in\njail for six weeks, and her eye searched anxiously the dark corner\nunder the bed, where the box was hidden.  It seemed quite safe and\nuntouched, but still Meg's voice was troubled as she spoke.\n\n'I thought I'd locked up all right,' she said, stepping into the room,\nwhile Robin took refuge behind her, and regarded the stranger closely\nfrom his place of safety.\n\n'Ay, it was all right,' answered the girl, 'only you see my key 'd\nunlock it; and I felt cold and low coming out of jail to-day; and I'd\nno coal, nor bread, nor nothing.  So I came in here, and made myself\ncomfortable.  Don't you be crusty, little Meg.  You'd be the same if\nyou'd been locked up for six weeks.  I wish I were dead, I do.'\n\nThe girl spoke sadly, and dropped her head again upon her hands, while\nMeg stood in the middle of the floor, not knowing what to do or say.\nShe sat down after a while upon the bedstead, and began taking off the\nbaby's things, pondering deeply all the time what course of action she\nought to follow.  She could place herself so as to conceal completely\nthe box under the bed; but if the girl's key would unlock her attic\ndoor, how was she ever to leave it for a moment in safety?  Then the\nthought flashed across her that father would be at home to-morrow, and\nshe would no longer have to take care of the hidden treasure.  In the\nmeantime Robin had stolen up to the stranger's side, and after closely\nconsidering her for some moments, he stroked her hand with his own\nsmall fingers.\n\n'I thought you were mother, I did,' he said.  'It's my birthday to-day.'\n\nFor one instant the girl looked at him with a smile in her sunken eyes,\nand then she lifted him on to her lap, and laid her face upon his curly\nhead, sobbing bitterly.\n\n'Little Meg,' she said, 'your mother spoke kind to me once, and now\nshe's dead and gone.  I wonder why I wasn't took instead o' her?'\n\nMeg's tender heart closed itself no longer against the stranger.  She\ngot up from her seat, and crossing the floor to the fireside, she put\nthe baby down by Robin on her lap.\n\n'You didn't ought to go into a person's room without asking leave,' she\nsaid; 'but if you'll hold baby for me, I'll soon get tea.  I've got a\nlittle real tea left, and father 'll buy some more to-morrow.  You mind\nthe children till it's ready.'\n\nIt was soon ready, and they drank and ate together, with few words.\nMeg was intent upon getting her weary children to bed as soon as\npossible, and after it was over she undressed them at once.  Before\nRobin got into bed she addressed the girl hesitatingly.\n\n'Robbie always says his prayers aloud to me,' she said; 'you won't\nmind, will you?'\n\n'Go on,' answered the girl, with a sob.\n\n'Robbie,' said Meg, as he knelt at her knee, with his hands held up\nbetween both her hands, 'Robbie, it's your birthday to-day; and if I\nwas you I'd ask God for something more than other days.  I'd ask Him to\nbless everybody as well as us if I was you.  If everybody was good,\nit'd be so nice.'\n\n'Yes, Meg,' replied Robin promptly, closing his black eyes before he\nbegan his prayer.  'Pray God, bless father on the big sea, and bless\nme, and Meg, and baby, and take care of us all.  Pray God, bless\neverybody, 'cept the devil.  Amen.'\n\nBut Robin did not get up from his knees.  He dropped his head upon\nMeg's lap, and when she moved he cried, 'Stop a minute!'  Meg waited\npatiently until he lifted up his face again, and shutting his eyes very\ntightly, said, 'Pray God, bless everybody, and the devil, and make him\na good man.  Amen.'\n\n'Robbie,' said Meg mournfully, 'I don't think the devil can be made\ngood.  He doesn't want to be good.  If anybody wants to be good, God\ncan make 'em good, anybody in all the world; but He won't if they don't\nwant to.'\n\nRobin was already half asleep, and gave little heed to Meg's words.\nShe tucked him snugly into his place beside baby, and stooping over\nthem, kissed both their drowsy faces with a loving and lingering\ntenderness.  Then she turned to the fire, and saw the strange girl\nthere upon her knees before her mother's chair, weeping again in a\npassion of tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Little Meg's Last Money\n\n'What's the matter with you?' asked Meg, laying her small rough hand\nupon the girl's head.\n\n'Oh, Meg, Meg!' she cried, 'I do want to be good, and I can't.  You\ndon't know how wicked I am; but once I was a good little girl like you.\nAnd now I can never, never be good again.'\n\n'Yes, you can,' answered little Meg, 'if you ask God.'\n\n'You don't know anything about it,' she said, pushing away Meg's hand.\n\n'I don't know much,' replied Meg meekly; 'but Jesus says in the Bible,\nthat if our fathers 'll give us good things, God 'll much more give\ngood things to anybody as asks for 'em.'\n\n'But I'm too bad to ask Him,' said the girl.\n\n'I don't know what's to be done, then,' answered Meg.  'The Bible says,\n\"Those that ask Him\"; and if you are too bad to ask Him, I suppose He\nwon't give you any good things.'\n\nThe girl made no reply, but crouching down upon the hearth at Meg's\nfeet, she sat looking into the fire with the expression of one who is\nthinking deeply.  Meg too was silent for a time, smiling now and then\nas she recollected that father would be at home to-morrow.\n\n'I don't know what you're called,' said Meg, after a very long silence.\n\n'Oh, they call me Kitty, and Puss, and Madcap, and all sorts o' names,'\nanswered the girl, with a deep sigh.\n\n'But that's not your christen name?' said Meg.\n\n'No,' she replied.\n\n'What does your mother call you?' asked Meg.\n\nFor a moment little Meg was terrified, for the girl seized her hands in\na strong and painful grasp, and her red eyes flamed with anger; but she\nloosed her hold gradually, and then, in a choking voice, she said,\n'Don't you never speak to me about my mother!'\n\n'Have you got any money, Kitty?' inquired Meg, by way of turning the\nconversation.\n\n'Not a rap,' said Kitty, laughing hoarsely.\n\n'I've got two shillings left,' continued Meg, 'and I'll give you one;\nonly, if you please, you mustn't come into my room again, at least till\nfather's at home.  I promised mother not to let anybody at all come\nhere.  You'll not be angry, will you?'\n\n'No, I'm not angry,' said Kitty gently, 'and you must always do what\nyour mother told you, little Meg.  She spoke kind to me once, she did.\nSo I'll go away now, dear, and never come in again: but you wouldn't\nmind me listening at the door when Robbie's saying his prayers\nsometimes?'\n\n'No,' answered Meg; 'and you may listen when I read up loud, if you\nlike.  I always read something afore I go to bed, and I'll speak up\nloud enough for you to hear.'\n\n'I'll listen,' said Kitty, standing up to go to her own dark, cold\nattic, and looking round sadly at Meg's tidy room, all ready as it was\nfor her father's arrival.  'I suppose you'd not mind me kissing the\nchildren afore I go?'\n\n'Oh no,' said Meg, going with her to the bedside, and looking down\nfondly upon the children's sleeping faces.  The baby's pale small face\nwore a smile upon it, as did Robin's also, for he was dreaming of the\ngardens he had visited on his birthday.  The girl bent over them, but\nshe drew back without kissing them, and with a sharp painful tone in\nher voice she said, 'I wish I was dead, I do.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Little Meg's Disappointment\n\nIf Meg had been up early on Robin's birthday, she was out of bed and\nabout her preparations still earlier the next morning.  She had time to\ngo over again most of her brushing and rubbing of the scanty furniture\nbefore the children awoke.  She reached out all their best clothes, and\nher own as well, for she did not intend to go down to the docks to meet\nher father, but thought it would be best to wait at home for his\narrival.  Her hands were full, and her thoughts also, for some time;\nand it was not till the nearest clock struck eleven that she could\nconsider all her preparations completed.\n\nWhen all her work was done, Meg helped Robin up to the window-sill, and\nclimbed after him herself to the perilous seat, with the baby held fast\nupon her lap.  It was the first time the baby had been allowed to\noccupy this dangerous place, and for the first few minutes Meg was not\nwithout her fears; but it was weary and languid this morning, and sat\nquite still upon her lap, with its little head resting upon her\nshoulder, and its grave eyes looking out inquiringly upon the strange\nworld in which it found itself.  Meg and Robin watched every man who\nentered the court; and every now and then Robin would clap his hands,\nand shout loudly, 'Father, father!' making Meg's arms tremble, and her\nheart beat fast with expectation.  But it was nine months since he had\ngone away, and Robin had almost forgotten him, so that it always proved\nnot to be her father.  Hour after hour passed by, and Meg cut up the\nlast piece of bread for the children and herself, and yet he never\ncame; though they stayed faithfully at their post, and would not give\nup looking for him as long as the daylight lasted.  But the night drew\nnear at last, an early night, for it was the first day in November, and\nLondon fogs grow thick then; and Meg kindled the fire again, and sat\ndown by it, unwilling to undress the children before he came.  So she\nsat watching and waiting, until the baby fell into a broken, sobbing\nslumber on her lap, and Robin lay upon the floor fast asleep.\n\nAt length Meg resolved to lay the children in bed, dressed as they\nwere, and steal down herself to the docks, under the shelter of the\nfog, to see if she could learn any news of the Ocean King.  She drew\nthe old shawl over her head, which well covered her red frock, and\ntaking off her shoes and stockings--for father would not miss them in\nthe night--she crept unseen and unheard down the dark staircase, and\nacross the swarming, noisy court.  The fog was growing thicker every\nminute, yet she was at no loss to find her way, so familiar it was to\nher.  But when she reached the docks, the darkness of the night, as\nwell as that of the fog, hid from her the presence of her good-natured\nfriend, if indeed he was there.  There were strange noises and rough\nvoices to be heard, and from time to time the huge figure of some tall\nman appeared to her for an instant in the gloom, and vanished again\nbefore little Meg could find courage to speak to him.  She drew back\ninto a corner, and peered eagerly, with wistful eyes, into the thick\nyellow mist which hid everything from them, while she listened to the\nclank of iron cables, and the loud sing-song of the invisible sailors\nas they righted their vessels.  If she could only hear her father's\nvoice among them!  She felt sure she should know it among a hundred\nothers, and she was ready to cry aloud the moment it reached her\nears--to call 'Father!' and he would be with her in an instant, and she\nin his arms, with her own clasped fast about his neck.  Oh, if he would\nbut speak out of the darkness!  Meg's keen eyes grew dim with tears,\nand her ears seemed to become dull of hearing, from the very longing to\nsee and hear more clearly.  But she rubbed away the tears with her\nshawl, and pushed the tangled hair away behind her small ears, and with\nher hands pressed against her heart, to deaden its throbbing, she\nleaned forward to pierce, if possible, through the thick dark veil\nwhich separated her from her father.\n\nShe had been there a long time when the thought crossed her, that\nperhaps after all he had been knocking at the door at home, and trying\nto open it; waking up the children, and making them cry and scream with\nterror at finding themselves quite alone.  She started up to hurry\naway; but at that moment a man came close by, and in the extremity of\nher anxiety Meg stopped him.\n\n'Please,' she said earnestly, 'is the Ocean King come in yet?'\n\n'Ay,' was the answer.  'Came in last night, all right and tight.'\n\n'Father must be come home, then,' thought Meg, speeding away swiftly\nand noiselessly with her bare feet along the streets to Angel Court.\nShe glanced up anxiously to her attic window, which was all in\ndarkness, while the lower windows glimmered with a faint light from\nwithin.  The landlord's room was full of a clamorous, quarrelling crew\nof drunkards; and Meg's spirit sank as she thought--suppose father had\nbeen up to their attic, and finding it impossible to get in at once,\nhad come down, and begun to drink with them!  She climbed the stairs\nquickly, but all was quiet there; and she descended again to hang about\nthe door, and listen, and wait; either to discover if he was there, or\nto prevent him turning in when he did come.  Little Meg's heart was\nfull of a woman's heaviest care and anxiety, as she kept watch in the\ndamp and the gloom of the November night, till even the noisy party\nwithin broke up, and went their way, leaving Angel Court to a brief\nseason of quietness.\n\nMeg slept late in the morning, but she was not disturbed by any knock\nat the door.  Robin had crept out of bed and climbed up alone to the\nwindow-sill, where fortunately the window was shut and fastened; and\nthe first thing Meg's eyes opened upon was Robin sitting there, in the\ntumbled clothes in which he had slept all night.  The morning passed\nslowly away in mingled hope and fear; but no step came up the ladder to\ntheir door, and Kitty had gone out early in the morning, before Meg was\nawake.  She spent her last shilling in buying some coal and oatmeal;\nand then, because it was raining heavily, she stationed herself on the\ntopmost step of the stairs, with Robin and baby, waiting with\never-growing dread for the long-delayed coming of her father.\n\nIt was growing dark again before any footstep came further than the\nlanding below, and then it was a soft, stealthy, slipshod step, not\nlike the strong and measured tread of a man.  It was a woman who\nclimbed the steep ladder, and Meg knew it could be no one else but\nKitty.  The girl sat down on the top step beside them, and took Robin\nupon her lap.\n\n'What are you all doing out here, little Meg?' she said, in a low,\ngentle voice, which Meg could scarcely believe to be the same as that\nwhich had sometimes frightened her by its shrill shrieks of drunken\nmerriment.\n\n'We're looking for father,' she answered weariedly.  'He's never come\nyet, and I've spent all my money, and we've got no candles.'\n\n'Meg,' said Kitty, 'I can pay you back the shilling you gave me on\nTuesday night.'\n\n'But you mustn't come into our room, if you do,' answered Meg.\n\n'No, no, I'll not come in,' said she, pressing a shilling into Meg's\nhand.  'But why hasn't father come home?'\n\n'I don't know,' sobbed Meg.  'His ship came in the night of Robbie's\nbirthday, that's two days ago; and he's never come yet.'\n\n'The ship come in!' repeated Kitty, in a tone of surprise.  'What's the\nname o' the ship, Meg?'\n\n'Father's ship's the Ocean King,' said Robin proudly.\n\n'I'll hunt him up,' cried Kitty, rising in haste.  'I'll find him, if\nhe's anywhere in London.  I know their ways, and where they go to, when\nthey come ashore, little Meg.  Oh!  I'll hunt him out.  You put the\nchildren to bed, dear; and then you sit up till I come back, if it's\npast twelve o'clock, I'll bring him home, alive or dead.  Don't cry no\nmore, little Meg.'\n\nShe called softly up the stairs to say these last words, for she had\nstarted off immediately.  Meg did as she had told her, and then waited\nwith renewed hope for her return.  It was past midnight before Kitty\ntapped quietly at the door, and she went out to her on the landing.\nBut Kitty was alone, and Meg could hardly stand for the trembling which\ncame upon her.\n\n'Haven't you found father?' she asked.\n\n'I've found out where he is,' answered Kitty.  'He's at the other end\nof the world, in hospital.  He was took bad a-coming home--so bad, they\nwas forced to leave him behind them; and he'll work his way back when\nhe's well enough, so Jack says, one of his mates.  He says he may come\nback soon, or come back late, and that's all he knows about him.  What\nshall you do, little Meg?'\n\n'Mother said I was to be sure to take care of the children till father\ncomes home,' she answered, steadying her voice; 'and I'll do it, please\nGod.  I can ask Him to help me, and He will.  He'll take care of us.'\n\n'He hasn't took care o' me,' said Kitty bitterly.\n\n'May be you haven't asked Him,' said Meg.\n\nKitty was silent for a minute, and then she spoke in a voice half\nchoked with sobs.\n\n'It's too late now,' she said, 'but He'll take care of you, never fear;\nand oh!  I wish He'd let me help Him.  I wish I could do something for\nyou, little Meg; for your mother spoke kind to me once, and made me\nthink of my own mother.  There, just leave me alone, will you?  I'm off\nto bed now, and you go to bed too.  I'll help you all I can.'\n\nShe pushed Meg back gently into her attic, and closed the door upon\nher; but Meg heard her crying and moaning aloud in her own room, until\nshe herself fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. Little Meg's Red Frock in Pawn\n\nMeg felt very forlorn when she opened her heavy eyelids the next\nmorning.  It was certain now that her father could not be home for some\ntime, it might be a long time; and how was she to buy bread for her\nchildren and herself?  She took down her mother's letter from the end\nof a shelf which supplied the place of a chimney-piece, and looked at\nit anxiously; but she dared not ask anybody to read it for her, lest it\nshould contain some mention of the money hidden in the box; and that\nmust be taken care of in every way, because it did not belong to her,\nor father even, but to one of his mates.  She had no friend to go to in\nall the great city.  Once she might have gone to the teacher at the\nschool where she had learned to read a little; but that had been in\nquite a different part of London, on the other side of the river, and\nthey had moved from it before her father had started on his last\nvoyage.  Meg sat thinking and pondering sadly enough, until suddenly,\nhow she did not know, her fears were all taken away, and her childish\nheart lightened.  She called Robin, and bade him kneel down beside her,\nand folding baby's hands together, she closed her own eyes, and bowed\nher head, while she asked God for the help He had promised to give.\n\n'Pray God,' said little Meg, 'You've let mother die, and father be took\nbad at the other side of the world, and there's nobody to take care of\nus 'cept You, and Jesus says, if we ask You, You'll give us bread and\neverything we want, just like father and mother.  Pray God, do!  I'm\nnot a grown-up person yet, and Robin's a very little boy, and baby\ncan't talk or walk at all; but there's nobody else to do anythink for\nus, and we'll try as hard as we can to be good.  Pray God, bless father\nat the other side of the world, and Robbie, and baby, and me; and bless\neverybody, for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.'\n\nMeg rose from her knees joyfully, feeling sure that her prayer was\nheard and would be answered.  She went out with her children to lay out\nthe shilling Kitty had returned to her the day before; and when they\ncome in she and Robin sat down to a lesson in reading.  The baby was\nmaking a pilgrimage of the room from chair to chair, and along the\nbedstead; but all of a sudden she balanced herself steadily upon her\ntiny feet, and with a scream of mingled dread and delight, which made\nMeg and Robin look up quickly, she tottered across the open floor to\nthe place where they were sitting, and hid her face in Meg's lap,\nquivering with joy and wonder.  Meg's gladness was full, except that\nthere was a little feeling of sorrow that neither father nor mother was\nthere to see it.\n\n'Did God see baby walk?' inquired Robin.\n\n'I should think He did!' said Meg confidently; and her slight sorrow\nfled away.  God could not help loving baby, she felt sure of that, nor\nRobin; and if He loved them, would He not take care of them Himself,\nand show her how to take care of them, till father was at home?  The\nday passed almost as happily as Robin's birthday; though the rain came\ndown in torrents, and pattered through the roof, falling splash, splash\ninto the broken tub, with a sound something like the fountain in Temple\nGardens.\n\nBut when Kitty's shilling was gone to the last farthing, and not a\nspoonful of meal remained in the bag, it was not easy to be happy.\nRobin and baby were both crying for food; and there was no coal to make\na fire, nor any candle to give them light during the long dark evenings\nof November.  Kitty was out all day now, and did not get home till\nlate, so Meg had not seen her since the night she had brought the news\nabout her father.  But a bright thought came to her, and she wondered\nat herself for not having thought of it before.  She must pawn her best\nclothes; her red frock and bonnet with green ribbons.  There was a\nnatural pang at parting with them, even for a time; but she comforted\nherself with the idea that father would get them back for her as soon\nas he returned.  She reached them out of the box, feeling carefully\nlest she should take any of Robin's or the baby's by mistake in the\ndark; and then she set off with her valuable bundle, wondering how many\nshillings she would get for them, and whether she could make the money\nlast till her father came.  The pawnbroker's shop was a small, dingy\nplace in Rosemary Lane; and it, and the rooms above it, were as full as\nthey could be with bundles such as poor Meg carried under her old\nshawl.  A single gas-light was flaring away in the window, and a\nhard-featured, sharp-eyed man was reading a newspaper behind the\ncounter.  Meg laid down her bundle timidly, and waited till he had\nfinished reading his paragraph; after which he opened it, spread out\nthe half-worn frock, and held up the bonnet on his fist, regarding them\nboth with a critical and contemptuous eye.  Some one else had entered\nthe shop, but Meg was too absorbed and too anxious to take any heed of\nit  The pawnbroker rolled the frock up scornfully, and gave it a push\ntowards her.\n\n[The pawnbroker spread out the half-worn frock, and held\nup the bonnet on his fist.]\n\n'Tenpence for the two,' he said, looking back at his newspaper.\n\n'Oh! if you please,' cried little Meg, in an agony of distress, 'you\nmust give me more than tenpence.  I've got two little children, and no\nbread, nor coals, nor candles.  I couldn't buy scarcely anythink with\nonly tenpence.  Indeed, indeed, my red frock's worth a great deal more;\nit's worth I don't know how many shillings.'\n\n'You go home, little Meg,' said Kitty's voice behind her, 'and I'll\nbring you three shillings for the frock, and one for the bonnet; four\nfor the two.  Mr Sloman's an old friend o' mine, he is; and he'll\noblige you for my sake.  There, you run away, and I'll manage this\nlittle bit o' business for you.'\n\nMeg ran away as she was told, glad enough to leave her business with\nKitty.  By-and-by she heard her coming upstairs, and went out to meet\nher.  Kitty placed four shillings in her hand.\n\n'Meg,' she said, 'you let me do that sort o' work for you always.\nThey'll cheat you ever so; but I wouldn't, not to save my life, if\nyou'll only trust me.  You ask me another time.  Is that the way God\ntakes care of you?'\n\n'He does take care of me,' answered Meg, with a smile; 'or may be you\nwouldn't have come into the shop just now, and I should have got only\ntenpence.  I suppose that's taking care of me, isn't it?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Kitty.  'Only let me do that for you when you want\nit done again.'\n\nIt was not very long before it wanted to be done again; and then Meg by\ndaylight went through the contents of the box, choosing out those\nthings which could best be spared, but leaving Robin's and baby's fine\nclothes to the last.  She clung to these with a strong desire to save\nthem, lest it should happen that her father came home too poor to\nredeem them.  The packet of money, tied up and sealed, fell at last to\nthe bottom of the almost empty box, and rolled noisily about whenever\nit was moved, but no thought of taking any of it entered into Meg's\nhead.  She was almost afraid of looking at it herself, lest the secret\nof it being there should get known in Angel Court; and whenever she\nmentioned it in her prayers, which she did every night, asking God to\ntake care of it, she did not even whisper the words, much less speak\nthem aloud, as she did her other requests, but she spoke inwardly only,\nfor fear lest the very walls themselves should hear her.  No one came\nnear her attic, except Kitty, and she kept her promise faithfully.\nSince the four bearers had carried away her mother's coffin, and since\nthe night Kitty came out of jail, the night of Robin's birthday, no\nstranger's foot had crossed the door-sill.\n\nBut November passed, and part of December, and Meg's stock of clothes,\nsuch as were of any value at the pawn-shop, was almost exhausted.  At\nthe end of the year the term for which her father had paid rent in\nadvance would be over, and Mr Grigg might turn her and her children out\ninto the streets.  What was to be done?  How was she to take care of\nRobin, and baby, and the money belonging to one of father's mates?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Little Meg's Friends in Need\n\nThese were hard times for little Meg.  The weather was not severely\ncold yet, or the children would have been bitterly starved up in their\ncold attic, where Meg was obliged to be very careful of the coal.  All\nher mother's clothes were in pledge now, as well as her own and\nRobin's; and it seemed as if it would soon come to pawning their poor\nbed and their scanty furniture.  Yet Meg kept up a brave spirit, and,\nas often as the day was fine enough, took her children out into the\nstreets, loitering about the cook-shops, where the heat from the cellar\nkitchens lent a soothing warmth to their shivering bodies.\n\nAbout the middle of December the first sharp frost set in, and Meg felt\nherself driven back from this last relief.  She had taken the children\nout as usual, but she had no shoes to put on their feet, and nothing\nbut their thin old rags to clothe them with.  Robin's feet were red and\nblue with cold, like her own; but Meg could not see her own, and did\nnot feel the cold as much for them as for Robin's.  His face had lost a\nlittle of its roundness and freshness, and his black eyes some of their\nbrightness since his birthday; and poor Meg's heart bled at the sight\nof him as he trudged along the icy pavement of the streets at her side.\nThere was one cook-shop from which warm air and pleasant odours came up\nthrough an iron grating, and Meg hurried on to it to feel its grateful\nwarmth; but the shutters of the shop were not taken down, and the\ncellar window was unclosed.  Little Meg turned away sadly, and bent her\nbare and aching feet homewards again, hushing baby, who wailed a\npitiful low wail in her ears.  Robin, too, dragged himself painfully\nalong, for he had struck his numbed foot against a piece of iron, and\nthe wound was bleeding a little.  They had turned down a short street\nwhich they had often passed through before, at the end of which was a\nsmall shop, displaying in its window a few loaves of bread, and some\nbottles containing different kinds of sweetmeats, such as they had\nindulged in sometimes in the palmy days when father was at home.  The\ndoor was divided in the middle, and the lower half was closed, while\nthe upper stood open, giving a full view of the shop within.  Meg's old\nbrown bonnet just rose above the top of the closed half, and her\nwistful face turned for a moment towards the tempting sight of a whole\nshelf full of loaves; but she was going on slowly, when a kindly voice\nhailed her from the dark interior.\n\n'Hollo, little woman!' it shouted, 'I haven't set eyes on you this many\na day.  How's Robbie and baby.'\n\n'They're here, sir, thank you,' answered Meg, in a more womanly way\nthan ever, for she felt very low to-day.  'We're only doing middling,\nthank you, sir.'\n\n'Why, father's ship's come in,' said her good-natured friend from the\ndocks, coming forward and wiping his lips, as if he had just finished a\ngood meal.  'What makes you be doing only middling?'\n\n'Father didn't come home in the ship,' replied Meg, her voice faltering\na little.\n\n'Come in and tell us all about it,' he said.  'Hollo, Mrs Blossom! just\nstep this way, if you please.'\n\nThere was a little kitchen at the back of the shop, from which came a\nvery savoury smell of cooking, as the door opened, and a round, fat,\nrosy-cheeked woman, of about fifty years of age, looked out\ninquiringly.  She came a step or two nearer the door, as Meg's friend\nbeckoned to her with a clasp-knife he held in his hand.\n\n'These little 'uns look cold and hungry, don't they, Mrs Blossom?' he\nsaid.  'You smell something as smells uncommon good, don't you?' he\nasked of Meg, who had sniffed a little, unconsciously.\n\n'Yes, please, sir,' answered Meg.\n\n'I've ate as much as ever I can eat for to-day,' said her friend, 'so\nyou give 'em the rest, Mrs Blossom, and I'll be off.  Only just tell me\nwhy father's not come home in his ship.'\n\n'He was took bad on the other side of the world,' replied Meg, looking\nup tearfully into his good-tempered face, 'and they was forced to leave\nhim behind in a hospital.  That's why.'\n\n'And what's mother doing?' he asked.\n\n'Mother's dead,' she answered.\n\n'Dead!' echoed her friend.  'And who's taking care of you young 'uns?'\n\n'There's nobody to take care of us but God,' said Meg, simply and\nsoftly.\n\n'Well, I never!' cried Mrs Blossom, seizing the baby out of Meg's, and\nclasping it in her own arms.  'I never heard anything like that.'\n\n'Nor me,' said the man, catching up Robin, and bearing him off into the\nwarm little kitchen, where a saucepan of hot tripe was simmering on the\nhob, and a round table, with two plates upon it, was drawn up close to\nthe fire.  He put Robin down on Mrs Blossom's seat, and lifted Meg into\na large arm-chair he had just quitted.\n\n'I guess you could eat a morsel of tripe,' he said, ladling it out in\noverflowing spoonfuls upon the plates.  'Mrs Blossom, some potatoes, if\nyou please, and some bread; and do you feed the baby whilst the little\nwoman gets her dinner.  Now, I'm off.  Mrs Blossom, you settle about\n'em coming here again.'\n\nHe was off, as he said, in an instant.  Meg sat in her large arm-chair,\ngrasping a big knife and fork in her small hands, but she could not\nswallow a morsel at first for watching Robin and the baby, who was\nsucking in greedily spoonfuls of potatoes, soaked in the gravy.  Mrs\nBlossom urged her to fall to, and she tried to obey; but her pale face\nquivered all over, and letting fall her knife and fork, she hid it in\nher trembling hands.\n\n'If you please, ma'am, I'm only so glad,' said little Meg as soon as\nshe could command her voice.  'Robbie and baby were so hungry, and I\nhadn't got anythink to give 'em.'\n\n'I suppose you aint hungry yourself neither,' observed Mrs Blossom, a\ntear rolling down a little channel between her round cheeks and her\nnose.\n\n'Oh, but ain't I!' said Meg, recovering herself still more.  'I've had\nnothink since last night, and then it were only a crust as Kitty give\nme.'\n\n'Well, dear, fall to, and welcome,' answered Mrs Blossom.  'And who's\nKitty?'\n\n'It's a grown-up person as lives in the back attic,' answered Meg,\nafter eating her first mouthful.  'She helps me all she can.  She's\ntook all my things to the pawn-shop for me, because she can get more\nmoney than me.  She's as good as can be to us.'\n\n'Are all your things gone to pawn?' inquired Mrs Blossom.\n\n'I've got baby's cloak and hood left,' she replied mournfully.  'He\nwouldn't give more than a shilling for 'em, and I thought it wasn't\nworth while parting with 'em for that.  I tried to keep Robbie's cap\nand pinafore, that were as good as new, but I were forced to let 'em\ngo.  And our shoes, ma'am,' added Meg, taking Robin's bare and bleeding\nfoot into her hand: 'see what poor Robbie's done to himself.'\n\n'Poor little dear!' said Mrs Blossom pityingly.  'I'll wash his poor\nlittle feet for him when he's finished his dinner.  You get on with\nyours likewise, my love.'\n\nMeg was silent for some minutes, busily feasting on the hot tripe, and\nbasking in the agreeable warmth of the cosy room.  It was a wonderfully\nbright little spot for that quarter of London, but the brightness was\nall inside.  Outside, at about three feet from the window, rose a wall\nso high as to shut out every glimpse of the sky; but within everything\nwas so clean and shining, even to the quarried floor, that it was\ndifficult to believe in the mud and dirt of the streets without.  Mrs\nBlossom herself looked fresh and comely, like a countrywoman; but there\nwas a sad expression on her round face, plain enough to be seen when\nshe was not talking.\n\n'My dear,' she said when Meg laid down her knife and fork, and assured\nher earnestly that she could eat no more, 'what may you be thinking of\ndoing?'\n\n'I don't hardly know,' she answered.  'I expect father home every day.\nIf I could only get enough for the children, and a crust or two for me,\nwe could get along.  But we can't do nothink more, I know.'\n\n'You'll be forced to go into the house,' said Mrs Blossom.\n\n'Oh, no, no, no!' cried little Meg, drawing Robin to her, and with a\ngreat effort lifting him on to her lap, where he almost eclipsed her.\n'I couldn't ever do that.  We'll get along somehow till father comes\nhome.'\n\n'Where is it you live?' inquired Mrs Blossom.\n\n'Oh, it's not a nice place at all,' said Meg, who dreaded having any\nvisitor.  'It's along Rosemary Lane, and down a street, and then down\nanother smaller street, and up a court.  That's where it is.'\n\nMrs Blossom sat meditating a few minutes, with the baby on her lap,\nstretching itself lazily and contentedly before the fire; while Meg,\nfrom behind Robin, watched her new friend's face anxiously.\n\n'Well,' she said, 'you come here again to-morrow, and I'll ask Mr\nGeorge what's to be done.  That was Mr George as was here, and he's my\nlodger.  He took you in, and maybe he'll agree to do something.'\n\n'Thank you, ma'am,' said Meg gratefully.  'Please, have you any little\nchildren of your own?'\n\nThe tears ran faster now down Mrs Blossom's cheeks, and she was obliged\nto wipe them away before she could answer.\n\n'I'd a little girl like you,' she said, 'ten years ago.  Such a pretty\nlittle girl, so rosy, and bright, and merry, as all the folks round\ntook notice of.  She was like the apple of my eye, she was.'\n\n'What was she called?' asked Meg, with an eager interest.\n\n'Why, the neighbours called her Posy because her name was Blossom,'\nsaid Mrs Blossom, smiling amidst her tears.  'We lived out in the\ncountry, and I'd a little shop, and a garden, and kept fowls, and pigs,\nand eggs; fresh eggs, such as the like are never seen in this part o'\nLondon.  Posy they called her, and a real posy she was.'\n\nMrs Blossom paused, and looked sadly down upon the happy baby, shaking\nher head as if she was sorely grieved at heart.\n\n'And Posy died?' said Meg softly.\n\n'No, no!' cried Mrs Blossom.  'It 'ud been a hundred times better if\nshe'd died.  She grew up bad.  I hope you'll never live to grow up bad,\nlittle girl.  And she ran away from home; and I lost her, her own\nmother that had nursed her when she was a little baby like this.  I'd\nha' been thankful to ha' seen her lying dead afore my eyes in her\ncoffin.'\n\n'That's bad,' said little Meg, in a tone of trouble and tender pity.\n\n'It's nigh upon three years ago,' continued Mrs Blossom, looking down\nstill upon the baby, as if she were telling her; 'and I gave up my shop\nto my son's wife, and come here, thinking maybe she'd step in some day\nor other to buy a loaf of bread or something, because I knew she'd come\nup to London.  But she's never so much as passed by the\nwindow--leastways when I've been watching, and I'm always watching.  I\ncan't do my duty by Mr George for staring out o' the window.'\n\n'Watching for Posy?' said little Meg.\n\n'Ay, watching for Posy,' repeated Mrs Blossom, 'and she never goes by.'\n\n'Have you asked God to let her go by?' asked Meg.\n\n'Ay, my dear,' said Mrs Blossom.  'I ask Him every blessed day o' my\nlife.'\n\n'Then she's sure to come some day,' said Meg joyfully.  'There's no\nmistake about that, because Jesus says it in the Bible, and He knows\nall about God.  You've asked Him, and He'll do it.  It's like father\ncoming.  I don't know whether he'll come to-day or to-morrow, or when\nit'll be; but he will come.'\n\n'God bless and love you!' cried Mrs Blossom, suddenly putting baby down\nin Meg's lap, and clasping all three of them in her arms.  'I'll\nbelieve it, I will.  He's sent you to give me more heart.  God love you\nall!'\n\nIt was some while before Mrs Blossom regained her composure; but when\nshe did, and it was time for Meg and the children to go home before it\nwas quite dark, she bound up Robin's foot in some rags, and gave Meg a\nloaf to carry home with her, bidding her be sure to come again the next\nday.  Meg looked back to the shop many times before turning the corner\nof the street, and saw Mrs Blossom's round face, with its white cap\nborder, still leaning over the door, looking after them, and nodding\npleasantly each time she caught Meg's backward glance.  At the corner\nthey all three turned round, Meg holding up baby as high as her arms\ncould reach, and after this last farewell they lost sight of their new\nfriend.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. Little Meg as Charwoman\n\nMeg and her children did not fail to make their appearance the next\nmorning at Mrs Blossom's shop, where she welcomed them heartily, and\nmade them comfortable again by the kitchen fire.  When they were well\nwarmed, and had finished some bread, and some coffee which had been\nkept hot for them, Mrs Blossom put on a serious business air.\n\n'Mr George and me have talked you over,' she said, 'and he's agreed to\nsomething.  I can't do my duty by him as I should wish, you know why;\nand I want a little maid to help me.'\n\n'Oh, if you please,' faltered little Meg, 'I couldn't leave our attic.\nI promised mother I wouldn't go away till father comes home.  Don't be\nangry, please.'\n\n'I'm not angry, child,' continued Mrs Blossom.  'I only want a little\nmaid to come mornings, and go away nights, like a char-woman.'\n\n'Mother used to go charing sometimes,' remarked Meg.\n\n'I'm not a rich woman,' resumed Mrs Blossom, 'and Mr George has his old\nfather to keep, as lives down in my own village, and I know him well;\nso we can't give great wages.  I'd give you a half-quartern loaf a day,\nand Mr George threepence for the present, while it's winter.  Would\nthat suit your views?'\n\n'What could I do with Robbie and baby?' asked Meg, with an air of\nperplexed thought.\n\n'Couldn't you leave 'em with a neighbour?' suggested Mrs Blossom.\n\nMeg pondered deeply for a while.  Kitty had told her the night before\nthat she had got some sailors' shirts to sew, and would stay at home to\nmake them.  She could trust Robin and the baby with Kitty, and instead\nof lighting a fire in her own attic she could give her the coals, and\nso save her fuel, as part payment for taking charge of the children.\nYet Meg felt a little sad at the idea of leaving them for so long a\ntime, and seeing so little of them each day, and she knew they would\nmiss her sorely.  But nothing else could be done, and she accepted Mrs\nBlossom's offer thankfully.\n\n'You needn't be here afore nine o' the morning,' said Mrs Blossom;\n'it's too early for Posy to be passing by; and you can go away again as\nsoon as it's dark in the evening.  You mustn't get any breakfast, you\nknow, because that's in our bargain; and I'd never grudge you a meal's\nmeat for the children either, bless 'em!  They shall come and have a\ngood tea with us sometimes, they shall--specially on Sundays, when Mr\nGeorge is at home; and if you'd only got your clothes out o' pawn, we'd\nall go to church together.  But we'll see, we'll see.'\n\nMeg entered upon her new duties the next morning, after committing the\nchildren, with many lingering kisses and last good-byes, into Kitty's\ncharge, who promised faithfully to be as kind to them as Meg herself.\nIf it had not been for her anxiety with regard to them, she would have\nenjoyed nothing better than being Mrs Blossom's little maid.  The good\nwoman was so kindly and motherly that she won Meg's whole heart; and to\nsee her sit by the shop window, knitting a very large long stocking for\nMr George, but with her eyes scanning every woman's face that went by,\nmade her feel full of an intense and childish interest.  She began\nherself to watch for Posy, as her mother described her; and whenever\nthe form of a grown-up girl darkened the doorway, she held her breath\nto listen if Mrs Blossom called her by that pet name.  Mr George also\nwas very good to Meg in his bluff way, and bought her a pair of nearly\nnew shoes with his first week's wages, over and above the threepence a\nday which he paid her.  With Mrs Blossom she held many a conversation\nabout the lost girl, who had grown up wicked, and was therefore worse\nthan dead; and before long Mr George observed that Meg had done her a\nworld of good.\n\nChristmas Day was a great treat to Meg; for though Mr George went down\ninto the country to see his old father, Mrs Blossom invited her and the\nchildren to come to dinner, and to stay with her till it was the little\nones' bedtime.  When they sat round the fire in the afternoon she told\nthem wonderful stories about the country--of its fields, and gardens,\nand lanes.\n\n'I like gardens,' said Robin, 'but I don't like lanes.'\n\n'Why don't you like lanes?' asked Mrs Blossom.\n\n'I know lots of lanes,' he answered.  'There's Rosemary Lane, and it's\nnot nice, nor none of 'em.  They ain't nice like Temple Gardens.'\n\n'Rosemary Lane!' repeated Mrs Blossom.  'Why, the lanes in the country\nare nothing like the lanes in London.  They're beautiful roads, with\ntall trees growing all along 'em, and meeting one another overhead; and\nthere are roses and honeysuckles all about the hedges, and birds\nsinging, and the sun shining.  Only you don't know anything about\nroses, and honeysuckles, and birds.'\n\n'Are there any angels there?' asked Robin, fastening his glistening\neyes upon her intently.\n\n'Well, no,' said Mrs Blossom, 'not as I know of.'\n\n'Is the devil in the country?' pursued Robin.\n\n'Yes,' answered Mrs Blossom, 'I suppose he's there pretty much the same\nas here.  Folks can be wicked anywhere, or else my Posy wouldn't have\ngrown up bad.'\n\nRobin asked no more questions, and Mrs Blossom was glad to talk of\nsomething else.  It was a very happy day altogether, but it came too\nquickly to an end.  Meg wrapped up her children well before turning out\ninto the cold streets, and Mrs Blossom gave them a farewell kiss each,\nwith two to Meg because she was such a comfort to her.\n\nWhen they reached their own attic they heard Kitty call to them, and\nMeg opened her door.  She was sitting without any fire, stitching away\nas for her life at a coarse striped shirt, lighted only by a small\nfarthing candle; but she laid down her task for a minute, and raised\nher thin pale face, and her eyes half blinded with tears and hard work.\n\n'Where have you been all day, little Meg?' she asked.\n\n'Me and the children have been at Mrs Blossom's, answered Meg, 'because\nit's Christmas Day: and I wish you'd been there as well, Kitty.  We'd\nsuch a good dinner and tea.  She gave me a bit of cake to bring home,\nand you shall have some of it.'\n\n'No, no,' said Kitty, 'it 'ud choke me.'\n\n'Oh, it couldn't; it's as nice as nice can be,' said Meg.  'You must\njust have a taste of it.'\n\n'Did you go talking about that Posy again?' asked Kitty, bending\ndiligently over her work.\n\n'We always talk about her,' answered Meg, 'every day.  Mrs Blossom's\nwatching for her to go by all day long, you know.'\n\n'She'll never go by,' said Kitty shortly.\n\n'Oh, she's certain sure to go by some day,' cried Meg.  'Mrs Blossom\nasks God to let her go by, every day of her life; and He's positive to\ndo it.'\n\n'If she's grown up so wicked,' argued Kitty, 'she didn't ought to go\nback to her mother, and her such a good woman.  God won't send her back\nto her mother, you'll see.'\n\n'But if God sent her back, her mother 'ud never think of her being\nwicked, she loves her so,' said little Meg.  'If Robbie were ever so\nnaughty, I'd keep on loving him till he was good again.'\n\n'Well, Posy'll never go home no more,' said Kitty; and hot tears fell\nfast upon her work.\n\n'She will, she will,' cried Meg.  'I expect her every day, like father.\nPerhaps they'll both come home to-morrow.  I wish you'd ask God to let\nPosy and father come home to-morrow.'\n\n'I'm too bad to ask God for anything,' sobbed Kitty.\n\n'Well, I don't know,' said Meg sorrowfully.  'You're not bad to me or\nthe children.  But I must go to bed now.  Let us kiss you afore we go.\nMrs Blossom kissed me twice, and said I was a comfort to her.'\n\nKitty threw down her work, and clasped Meg strongly in her arms,\npressing down Meg's head upon her breast, and crying, 'Oh, my dear\nlittle Meg!  My good little Meg!'  Then she put them all three gently\nout of her room, and bade them good-night and God bless them, in a\nhusky and tremulous voice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Little Meg's Baby\n\nThe new year came, but Meg's father had not arrived.  Kitty was having\na mad outburst, as if she had so long controlled herself that now it\nwas necessary to break out into extra wickedness.  She came home late\nevery night, very drunk, and shouting loud snatches of songs, which\nwakened up the inmates of the lower stories, and drew upon her a storm\nof oaths.  But she continued always good-natured and kind to Meg, and\ninsisted upon having the daily charge of Robin and the baby, though Meg\nleft them in her care with a very troubled and anxious spirit.  Things\nwere looking very dark to the poor little woman; but she kept up as\nbrave a heart as she could, waiting from day to day for that\nlong-deferred coming of her father, in which she believed so firmly.\n\nIt was a little later than usual one evening, for the days were\ncreeping out since the new year, when Meg climbed wearily upstairs to\nKitty's attic, in search of her children, but found that they were not\nthere.  Mr Grigg told her that he had seen Kitty take them out with her\nin the afternoon; and even while he was speaking, Meg saw her\nstaggering and rolling into the court, with the baby fast asleep in her\ndrunken arms.  Meg took it from her without a word, and led Robin away\nupstairs.  Robin's face was flushed, and his hand was very hot; but the\nbaby lay in her arms heavily, without any movement or sign of life,\nexcept that the breath came through her parted lips, and her eyelids\nstirred a little.  Meg locked the door of her attic, and laid her baby\non the bed, while she lighted the fire and got their tea ready.  Robin\nlooked strange, but he chattered away without ceasing, while he watched\nher set the things in readiness.  But the baby would not awake.  It lay\nquite still on Meg's lap, and she poured a little warm tea into its\nmouth, but it did not swallow it, only slept there with heavy eyelids,\nand moving neither finger nor foot, in a strange, profound slumber.  It\nwas smaller and thinner than when mother died, thought Meg; and she\nlifted up the lifeless little hand to her lips, half hoping that its\neyes would unclose a little more, and that sweet, loving smile, with\nwhich it always welcomed her return, would brighten its languid face.\nBut baby was too soundly asleep to smile.\n\nLittle Meg sat up all night, with the baby lying on her lap, moaning a\nlittle now and then as its slumbers grew more broken, but never lifting\nup its eyelids to look into her face and know it.  When the morning\ndawned it was still the same.  Could the baby be ill? asked Meg of\nherself.  It did not seem to be in any pain; yet she carried it to the\ndoor, and called softly for Kitty to come and look at it; but there was\nno reply, only from below came up harsh sounds of children screaming\nand angry women quarrelling.  Oaths and threats and shrieks were all\nthe answer Meg's feeble cry received.  She sat down again on her\nmother's low chair before the fire, and made the baby comfortable on\nher lap; while Robin stood at her knee, looking down pitifully at the\ntiny, haggard, sleeping face, which Meg's little hand could almost\ncover.  What was she to do?  There was no one in Angel Court whom she\ndare call to her help.  Baby might even die, like the greater number of\nthe babies born in that place, whose brief lives ended quickly, as if\nexistence was too terrible a thing in the midst of such din and\nsqualor.  At the thought that perhaps baby was going to die, two or\nthree tears of extreme anguish rolled down little Meg's cheeks, and\nfell upon baby's face; but she could not cry aloud, or weep many tears.\nShe felt herself falling into a stupor of grief and despair, when Robin\nlaid his hand upon her arm.\n\n'Why don't you ask God to waken baby?' he asked.\n\n'I don't know whether it 'ud be a good thing,' she answered.  'Mother\nsaid she'd ask Him over and over again to let her take baby along with\nher, and that 'ud be better than staying here.  I wish we could all go\nto heaven; only I don't know whatever father 'ud do if he come home and\nfound us all dead.'\n\n'Maybe God'll take me and baby,' said Robbie thoughtfully, 'and leave\nyou to watch for father.'\n\n'I only wish baby had called me Meg once afore she went,' cried little\nMeg.\n\nThe baby stirred a little upon her knees, and stretched out its feeble\nlimbs, opening its blue eyes wide and looking up into her face with its\nsweet smile of welcome.  Then the eyelids closed again slowly, and the\nsmall features put on a look of heavenly calm and rest.  Meg and Robin\ngazed at the change wonderingly without speaking; but when after a few\nminutes Meg laid her hand gently upon the smooth little forehead, the\nsame chill struck to her heart as when she had touched her mother's\ndead face.\n\nIt did not seem possible to little Meg that baby could really be dead.\nShe chafed its puny limbs, as she had seen her mother do, and walked up\nand down the room singing to it, now loudly, now softly; but no change\ncame upon it, no warmth returned to its death-cold frame, no life to\nits calm face.  She laid it down at length upon the bed, and crossed\nits thin wee arms upon its breast, and then stretching herself beside\nit, with her face hidden from the light, little Meg gave herself up to\na passion of sorrow.\n\n'If I'd only asked God, for Christ's sake,' she cried to herself,\n'maybe He'd have let baby wake, though I don't know whether it's a good\nthing.  But now she's gone to mother, and father'll come home, and\nhe'll find nobody but me and Robbie, and the money safe.  Oh!  I wish\nI'd asked God.'\n\n'Meg,' said Robin, after she had worn herself out with sobs and tears,\nand was lying silently beside baby, 'I'm very poorly.  I think I'll go\nto live with the angels, where mother and baby are gone.'\n\nMeg started up, and gazed anxiously at Robin.  His bright eyes were\ndimmed, and his face was flushed and heavy; he was stretched on the\nfloor near the fire, in a listless attitude, and did not care to move,\nwhen she knelt down beside him, and put her arm under his head.  It\nached, he said; and it felt burning hot to her touch.  Meg's heart\nstood still for a moment, and then she dropped her tear-stained\nsorrowful face upon her hands.\n\n'Pray God,' she cried, 'don't take Robbie away as well as baby.  Maybe\nit wasn't a good thing for baby to stay, now mother's dead, though I've\ndone everythink I could, and there's been nobody to take care of us but\nYou.  But, pray God, do let Robbie stay with me till father comes home;\nfor Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.'\n\nMeg rose from her knees, and lifted up Robin as gently as she could,\nsoothing him, and talking fondly to him as she took off his clothes.\nWhen that was finished she laid him on the same bed where the baby was\nsleeping its last long sleep, with its tiny face still wearing an\nunspeakable calm; for Robin's little mattress had been sold some time\nago.  The day was just at an end, that sorrowful day, and a lingering\nlight from the west entered through the attic window, and lit up the\nwhite, peaceful features with the flushed and drowsy face of Robin\nbeside it.  Meg felt as if her heart would surely break as she stooped\nover them, and kissed them both, her lips growing cold as they touched\nbaby's smiling mouth.  Then drawing her old shawl over her head, she\nlocked the attic door securely behind her, and ran as fast as her feet\ncould carry her to Mrs Blossom's house.\n\n'Robbie's very ill,' gasped Meg, breathlessly, as she burst into the\nshop, the shutters of which were already put up, though it was still\nearly in the night, 'and I want a doctor for him.  Where shall I find a\ndoctor?'\n\nMrs Blossom had her bonnet and cloak on, and looked very pale and\nflurried.  When she answered Meg she kept her hand pressed against her\nheart.\n\n'I'm just a-going to one,' she said, 'the best at this end o' London,\nDr Christie, and you'd better come along with me.  He knows me well.\nMeg, I've seen somebody go by to-day as was like Posy, only pale and\nthin; but when I ran out, she was gone like a shadow.  I'm a-going to\ntell Dr Christie; he knows all about Posy and me.'\n\nBut Meg scarcely heard what Mrs Blossom said.  All her thoughts and\ninterest centred in Robin, and she felt impatient of the slow progress\nof her companion.  They seemed to her to be going a long, long way,\nuntil they came to better streets and larger houses; and by-and-by they\nsaw a carriage standing before a door, and a gentleman came out and got\ninto it hurriedly.\n\n'Why, bless me!' exclaimed Mrs Blossom, 'there's Dr Christie.  Stop\nhim, Meg, stop him!'\n\nMeg needed no urging, but rushed blindly across the street.  There was\nall at once a strange confusion about her, a trampling of horses' feet,\nand a rattling of wheels, with a sudden terror and pain in herself; and\nthen she knew no more.  All was as nothing to her--baby and Robin alone\nin the attic, and Mrs Blossom and Posy--all were gone out of her mind\nand memory.  She had thrown herself before the horses' heads, and they\nhad trampled her down under their feet.\n\nWhen little Meg came to herself again it was broad daylight, and she\nwas lying in a room so bright and cheerful that she could neither\nimagine where she was nor how she came there.  There was a good fire\ncrackling noisily in the low grate, with a brass guard before it, and\nover the chimney-piece was a pretty picture of angels flying upwards\nwith a child in their arms.  All round the walls there hung other\npictures of birds and flowers, coloured gaily, and glittering in gilded\nframes.  Another little bed like the one she lay in stood in the\nopposite corner, but there was nobody in it, and the place was very\nquiet.  She lay quite still, with a dreamy thought that she was somehow\nin heaven, until she heard a pleasant voice speaking in the next room,\nthe door of which was open, so that the words came readily to her ears.\n\n'I only wish we knew where the poor little thing comes from,' said the\nvoice.\n\n'I'm vexed I don't,' answered Mrs Blossom.  'I've asked her more than\nonce, and she's always said it's down a street off Rosemary Lane, and\nalong another street, and up a court.  But there's a girl called Kitty\nliving in the back attic, as takes care of the children when Meg's\naway.  She's sure to be taking care o' them now.'\n\nIn an instant memory came back to little Meg.  She recollected bending\nover Robin and the baby to kiss them before she came away, and locking\nthe door safely upon them.  Oh! what had become of Robbie in the night?\nShe raised herself up in bed, and uttered a very bitter cry, which\nbrought to her quickly Mrs Blossom and a strange lady.\n\n'I want Robbie,' she cried.  'I must get up and go to him directly.\nIt's my Robbie that's ill, and baby's dead.  I'm not ill, but Robbie's\nill, if he isn't dead, like baby, afore now.  Please to let me get up.'\n\n'Tell me all about it,' said Mrs Blossom, sitting down on the bed and\ntaking Meg into her arms.  'We're in Dr Christie's house, and he'll go\nand see Robbie in a minute, he says.'\n\n'Baby died yesterday morning,' answered Meg, with tearless eyes, for\nher trouble was too great for tears; 'and then Robbie was took ill, and\nI put them both in bed, and kissed them, and locked the door, and came\naway for a doctor, and there's been nobody to take care of 'em all\nnight, only God.'\n\nMeg's eyes burned no longer, but filled with tears as she thought of\nGod, and she laid her head upon Mrs Blossom's shoulder, and wept aloud.\n\n'God has taken care of them,' said Mrs Christie, but she could say no\nmore.\n\n'Where is it you live, deary?' asked Mrs Blossom.\n\n'It's at Angel Court,' answered Meg.  'But there mustn't nobody go\nwithout me.  Please to let me get up.  I'm not ill.'\n\n'You're very much bruised and hurt, my poor child,' said Mrs Christie.\n\n'I must go,' pleaded Meg urgently, 'I must get up, I promised mother\nI'd never let anybody go into our room, and they mustn't go without me.\nThey're my children, please.  If your little children were ill, you'd\ngo to 'em wouldn't you?  Let me get up this minute.'\n\nIt was impossible to withstand little Meg's earnestness.  Mrs Blossom\ndressed her tenderly, though Meg could not quite keep back the groan\nwhich rose to her quivering lips when her bruised arm was moved.  A cab\nwas called, and then Mrs Blossom and Meg, with Dr Christie, got into\nit, and drove away quickly to Angel Court.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. The End of Little Meg's Trouble\n\nIt was early in the evening after Meg had gone in search of a doctor,\nthat Kitty came home, more sober than she had been for several nights,\nand very much ashamed of her last outbreak.  She sat down on the top of\nthe stairs, listening for little Meg to read aloud, but she heard only\nthe sobs and moanings of Robin, who called incessantly for Meg, without\ngetting any answer.  Kitty waited for some time, hearkening for her\nvoice, but after a while she knocked gently at the door.  There was no\nreply, but after knocking again and again she heard Robin call out in a\nfrightened tone.\n\n'What's that?' he cried.\n\n'It's me, your own Kitty,' she said; 'where's little Meg?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Robin, 'she's gone away, and there's nobody but me\nand baby; and baby's asleep, and so cold.'\n\n'What are you crying for, Robbie?' asked Kitty.\n\n'I'm crying for everything,' said Robin.\n\n'Don't you be frightened, Robbie,' she said soothingly; 'Kitty'll stay\noutside the door, and sing pretty songs to you, till Meg comes home.'\n\nShe waited a long time, till the clocks struck twelve, and still Meg\ndid not come.  From time to time Kitty spoke some reassuring words to\nRobin, or sang him some little songs she remembered from her own\nchildhood; but his cries grew more and more distressing, and at length\nKitty resolved to break her promise, and unlock Meg's door once again\nto move the children into her own attic.\n\nShe lit a candle, and entered the dark room.  The fire was gone out,\nand Robin sat up on the pillow, his face wet with tears and his black\neyes large with terror.  The baby, which lay beside him, seemed very\nstill, with its wasted puny hands crossed upon its breast; so quiet and\nstill that Kitty looked more closely, and held the light nearer to its\nslumbering face.  What could ail it?  What had brought that awful smile\nupon its tiny face?  Kitty touched it fearfully with the tip of her\nfinger; and then she stood dumb and motionless before the terrible\nlittle corpse.\n\nShe partly knew, and partly guessed, what had done this thing.  She\nrecollected, but vaguely enough, that one of her companions, who had\ngrown weary of the little creature's pitiful cry, had promised to quiet\nit for her, and how speedily it had fallen off into a profound,\nunbroken slumber.  And there it lay, in the same slumber perhaps.  She\ntouched it again; but no, the sleep it slept now was even deeper than\nthat--a sleep so sound that its eyelids would never open again to this\nworld's light, nor its sealed lips ever utter a word of this world's\nspeech.  Kitty could scarcely believe it; but she could not bear to\nstay in that mute, gentle, uncomplaining presence; and she lifted up\nRobin to carry him into her own room.  Oh that God had but called her\naway when she was an innocent baby like that!\n\nRobin's feverishness was almost gone; and now, wrapped in Kitty's gown\nand rocked to sleep on her lap, he lay contented and restful, while she\nsat thinking in the dark, for the candle soon burned itself out, until\nthe solemn grey light of the morning dawned slowly in the east.  She\nhad made up her mind now what she would do.  There was only one more\nsin lying before her.  She had grown up bad, and broken her mother's\nheart, and now she had brought this great overwhelming sorrow upon poor\nlittle Meg.  There was but one end to a sinful life like hers, and the\nsooner it came the better.  She would wait till Meg came home and give\nup Robin to her, for she would not hurry on to that last crime before\nMeg was there to take care of him.  Then she saw herself stealing along\nthe streets, down to an old pier she knew of, where boats had ceased to\nply, and where no policeman would be near to hinder her, or any one\nabout to rescue her; and then she would fling herself, worthless and\nwretched as she was, into the rapid river, which had borne so many\nworthless wretches like her upon its strong current into the land of\ndarkness and death, of which she did not dare to think.  That was what\nshe would do, saying nothing to any one; and if she could ask anything\nof God, it would be that her mother might never find out what had\nbecome of her.\n\nSo Kitty sat with her dark thoughts long after Angel Court had awakened\nto its ordinary life, its groans, and curses, and sobs; until the sun\nlooked in cheerily upon her and Robin, as it did upon Meg in Mrs\nChristie's nursery.  She did not care to put him down, for he looked\nvery pretty, and happy, and peaceful in his soft sleep, and whenever\nshe moved he stirred a little, and pouted his lips as if to reproach\nher.  Besides, it was the last time she would hold a child in her arms;\nand though they ached somewhat, they folded round him fondly.  At last\nshe heard a man's step upon the ladder mounting to the attics, and\nMeg's voice speaking faintly.  Could it be that her father was come\nhome at last?  Oh! what would their eyes see when they opened that\ndoor?  Kitty held her breath to listen for the first sound of anguish\nand amazement; but it was poor little Meg's voice which reached her\nbefore any other.\n\n'Robbie! oh, Robbie!' she cried, in a tone of piercing terror, 'what\nhas become of my little Robbie?'\n\n'He's safe, he's here, Meg,' answered Kitty, starting to her feet, and\nrushing with him to Meg's attic.\n\nIt was no rough, weather-beaten seaman, who was just placing Meg on a\nchair, as if he had carried her upstairs; but some strange, well-clad\ngentleman, and behind him stood an elderly woman, who turned sharply\nround as she heard Kitty's voice.\n\n'Posy!' cried Mrs Blossom.\n\nNo one but her own mother could have known again the bright, merry,\nrosy girl, whom the neighbours called Posy, in the thin, withered,\npallid woman who stood motionless in the middle of the room.  Even Meg\nforgot for a moment her fears for Robin.  Dr Christie had only time to\ncatch him from her failing arms, before she fell down senseless upon\nthe floor at her mother's feet.\n\n'Let me do everything for her,' exclaimed Mrs Blossom, pushing away Dr\nChristie; 'she's my Posy, I tell you.  You wouldn't know her again, but\nI know her.  I'll do everything for her; she's my girl, my little one;\nshe's the apple of my eye.'\n\nBut it was a very long time before Mrs Blossom, with Dr Christie's\nhelp, could bring Posy to life again; and then they lifted her into her\npoor bed, and Dr Christie left her mother alone with her, and went back\nto Meg.  Robin was ailing very little, he said: but the baby?  Yes, the\nbaby must have died even if little Meg had fetched him at once.\nNothing could have saved it, and it had suffered no pain, he added\ntenderly.\n\n'I think I must take you two away from this place,' said Dr Christie.\n\n'Oh, no, no,' answered Meg earnestly; 'I must stay till father comes,\nand I expect him to-day or to-morrow.  Please, sir, leave me and Robbie\nhere till he comes.'\n\n'Then you must have somebody to take care of you,' said Dr Christie.\n\n'No, please, sir,' answered Meg, in a low and cautious voice, 'mother\ngave me a secret to keep that I can't tell to nobody, and I promised\nher I'd never let nobody come into my room till father comes home.  I\ncouldn't help you, and Mrs Blossom, and Kitty coming in this time; but\nnobody mustn't come in again.'\n\n'My little girl,' said Dr Christie kindly, 'I dare say your mother\nnever thought of her secret becoming a great trouble to you.  Could you\nnot tell it to me?'\n\n'No,' replied Meg, 'it's a very great secret; and please, when baby's\nburied like mother, me and Robbie must go on living here alone till\nfather comes.'\n\n'Poor child!' said Dr Christie, rubbing his eyes, 'did you know baby\nwas quite dead?'\n\n'Yes,' she answered, 'but I didn't ask God to let baby live, because\nmother said she'd like to take her with her.  But I did ask Him to make\nRobin well, and bring back Posy; and now there's nothing for Him to do\nbut let father come home.  I knew it was all true; it's in the Bible,\nand if I'm not one of God's own children, it says, \"Them that ask Him.\"\nSo I asked Him.'\n\nMeg's voice sank, and her head dropped; for now that she was at home\nagain, and Robin was found to be all right, her spirit failed her.  Dr\nChristie went out upon the landing, and held a consultation with Mrs\nBlossom, in which they agreed that for the present, until Meg was well\nenough to take care of herself, she should be nursed in Kitty's attic,\nwith her own door kept locked, and the key left in her possession.  So\nDr Christie carried Meg into the back attic, and laid her upon Kitty's\nmattress.  Kitty was cowering down on the hearth, with her face buried\non her knees, and did not look up once through all the noise of Meg's\nremoval; though when her mother told her what they were doing she made\na gesture of assent to it.  Dr Christie went away; and Mrs Blossom, who\nwanted to buy many things which were sorely needed in the poor attic,\nput her arm fondly round Kitty's neck.\n\n'Posy,' she said, 'you wouldn't think to go and leave little Meg alone\nif I went out to buy some things, and took Robin with me?'\n\n'No, I'll stop,' said Kitty, but without lifting her head.  When they\nwere alone together, Meg raised herself as well as she could on the arm\nthat was not hurt, and looked wistfully at Kitty's bowed-down head and\ncrouching form.\n\n'Are you really Posy?' she asked.\n\n'I used to be Posy,' answered Kitty, in a mournful voice.\n\n'Didn't I tell you God would let your mother find you?' said Meg; 'it's\nall come true, every bit of it.'\n\n'But God hasn't let baby live,' muttered Kitty.\n\n'I never asked Him for that,' she said falteringly; 'I didn't know as\nbaby was near going to die, and maybe it's a better thing for her to go\nto mother and God.  Angel Court ain't a nice place to live in, and she\nmight have growed up bad.  But if people do grow up bad,' added Meg, in\na very tender tone, 'God can make 'em good again if they'd only ask\nHim.'\n\nAs little Meg spoke, and during the silence which followed, strange\nmemories began to stir in the poor girl's heart, recalled there by some\nmysterious and Divine power.  Words and scenes, forgotten since\nchildhood, came back with wonderful freshness and force.  She thought\nof a poor, guilty, outcast woman, reviled and despised by all save One,\nwho had compassion even for her, forgave all her sins, stilled the\nclamour of her accusers, and said, 'Thy faith hath saved thee; go in\npeace.'  She remembered the time when the records of His infinite love\nhad been repeated by her innocent young lips and pondered in her maiden\nheart.  Like some echo from the distant past she seemed to hear the\nwords, 'By Thine agony and bloody sweat; by Thy cross and passion; by\nThy precious death and burial, good Lord deliver us.  O Lamb of God,\nthat takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.'\n\n'Oh!  Meg!  Meg!' cried Kitty, almost crawling to the corner where she\nlay, and falling down beside her on the floor, with her poor pale face\nstill hidden from sight, 'ask God for me to be made good again.'\n\nLittle Meg stretched out her unbruised arm, and laid her hand upon\nKitty's bended head.\n\n'You must ask Him for yourself,' she said, after thinking for a minute\nor two: 'I don't know as it 'ud do for me to ask God, if you didn't as\nwell.'\n\n'What shall I say, Meg?' asked Kitty.\n\n'If I was you,' said Meg, 'and had grow'd up wicked, and run away from\nmother, I'd say, \"Pray God, make me a good girl again, and let me be a\ncomfort to mother till she dies; for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.\"'\n\nThere was a dead silence in the back attic, except for the near noise\nand distant din which came from the court below, and the great\nlabyrinth of streets around.  Little Meg's eyes shone lovingly and\npityingly upon Kitty, who looked up for an instant, and caught their\nlight.  Then she dropped her head down upon the mattress, and gave way\nto a storm of tears and sobs.\n\n'O God,' she cried, 'do have mercy upon me, and make me good again, if\nit's possible.  Help me to be a good girl to mother.  God forgive me\nfor Jesus Christ's sake!'\n\nShe sobbed out this prayer over and over again, until her voice fell\ninto a low whisper which even Meg could not hear; and so she lay upon\nthe floor beside the mattress until her mother came back.  Mrs\nBlossom's face was pale, but radiant with gladness, and Posy looked at\nit for the first time fully.  Then she gave a great cry of mingled joy\nand sorrow, and running to her threw her arms round her neck, and laid\nher face upon her shoulder.\n\n'God'll hear me and have mercy upon me,' she cried.  'I'm going to be\nyour Posy again, mother!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. Little Meg's Father\n\nThe baby was buried the next morning, after Meg had looked upon it for\nthe last time lying very peacefully and smilingly in its little coffin,\nand had shed some tears that were full of sorrow yet had no bitterness\nupon its dead face.  Mrs Blossom took Robin to follow it to the grave,\nleaving Kitty in charge of little Meg.  The front attic door was\nlocked, and the key was under Meg's pillow, not to be used again until\nshe was well enough to turn it herself in the lock.  The bag containing\nthe small key of the box, with the unopened letter which had come for\nher mother, hung always round her neck, and her hand often clasped it\ntightly as she slept.\n\nMeg was lying very still, with her face turned from the light,\nfollowing in her thoughts the little coffin that was being carried in\nturns by Mrs Blossom and another woman whom she knew, through the noisy\nstreets, when Kitty heard the tread of a man's foot coming up the\nladder.  It could be no one else but Dr Christie, she thought; but why\nthen did he stop at the front attic door, and rattle the latch in\ntrying to open it?  Kitty looked out and saw a seafaring man, in worn\nand shabby sailor's clothing, as if he had just come off a long voyage.\nHis face was brown and weather-beaten; and his eyes, black and bright,\nwere set deep in his head, and looked as if they were used to take\nlong, keen surveys over the glittering sea.  He turned sharply round as\nKitty opened her door.\n\n'Young woman,' he said, 'do you know aught of my wife, Peggy Fleming,\nand her children, who used to live here?  Peggy wrote me word she'd\nmoved into the front attic.'\n\n'It's father,' called little Meg from her mattress on the floor; 'I'm\nhere, father!  Robin and me's left; but mother's dead, and baby.  Oh!\nfather, father!  You've come home at last!'\n\nMeg's father brushed past Kitty into the room where Meg sat up in bed,\nher face quivering, and her poor bruised arms stretched out to welcome\nhim.  He sat down on the mattress and took her in his own strong arms,\nwhile for a minute or two Meg lay still in them, almost like one dead.\n\n'Oh!' she said at last, with a sigh as if her heart had well-nigh\nbroken, 'I've took care of Robin and the money, and they're safe.  Only\nbaby's dead.  But don't you mind much, father; it wasn't a nice place\nfor baby to grow up in.'\n\n'Tell me all about it,' said Robert Fleming, looking at Kitty, but\nstill holding his little daughter in his arms; and Kitty told him all\nshe knew of her lonely life and troubles up in the solitary attic,\nwhich no one had been allowed to enter; and from time to time Meg's\nfather groaned aloud, and kissed Meg's pale and wrinkled forehead\nfondly.  But he asked how it was she never let any of the neighbours,\nKitty herself, for instance, stay with her, and help her sometimes.\n\n'I promised mother,' whispered Meg in his ear, 'never to let nobody\ncome in, for fear they'd find out the box under the bed, and get into\nit somehow.  We was afraid for the money, you know, but it's all safe\nfor your mate, father; and here's the key, and a letter as came for\nmother after she was dead.'\n\n'But this letter's from me to Peggy,' said her father, turning it over\nand over; 'leastways it was wrote by the chaplain at the hospital, to\ntell her what she must do.  The money in the box was mine, Meg, no\nmate's; and I sent her word to take some of it for herself and the\nchildren.'\n\n'Mother thought it belonged to a mate of yours,' said Meg, 'and we was\nthe more afeared of it being stole.'\n\n'It's my fault,' replied Robert Fleming.  'I told that to mother for\nfear she'd waste it if she knew it were mine.  But if I'd only\nknown----'\n\nHe could not finish his sentence, but stroked Meg's hair with his large\nhand, and she felt some hot tears fall from his eyes upon her forehead.\n\n'Don't cry, father,' she said, lifting her small feeble hand to his\nface.  'God took care of us, and baby too, though she's dead.  There's\nnothink now that He hasn't done.  He's done everythink I asked Him.'\n\n'Did you ask Him to make me a good father?' said Fleming.\n\n'Why, you're always good to us, father,' answered Meg, in a tone of\nloving surprise.  'You never beat us much when you get drunk.  But\nRobin and me always say, \"Pray God, bless father.\"  I don't quite know\nwhat bless means, but it's something good.'\n\n'Ah!' said Fleming, with a deep sigh, 'He has blessed me.  When I was\nill He showed me what a poor sinner I was, and how Jesus Christ came\ninto the world to save sinners, \"of whom I am chief.\"  Sure I can say\nthat if anybody can.  But it says in the Bible, \"He loved me, and gave\nHimself for me.\"  Yes, little Meg, He died to save me.  I felt it.  I\nbelieved it.  I came to see that I'd nobody to fly to but Jesus if I\nwanted to be aught else but a poor, wicked, lost rascal, as got drunk,\nand was no better than a brute.  And so I turned it over and over in my\nmind, lying abed; and now, please God, I'm a bit more like being a\nChristian than I was.  I reckon that's what bless means, little Meg.'\n\nAs he spoke the door opened, and Mrs Blossom came in with Robin.  It\nwas twelve months since Robin had seen his father, and now he was shy,\nand hung back a little behind Mrs Blossom; but Meg called to him in a\njoyful voice.\n\n'Come here, little Robbie,' she said; 'it's father, as we've watched\nfor so long.--He's a little bit afeared at first, father, but you'll\nlove him ever so when he knows you.'\n\nIt was not long before Robin knew his father sufficiently to accept of\na seat on his knee, when Meg was put back into bed at Mrs Blossom's\nentreaties.  Fleming nursed his boy in silence for some time, while now\nand then a tear glistened in his deep eyes as he thought over the\nhistory of little Meg's sorrows.\n\n'I'm thinking,' said Mrs Blossom cheerfully, 'as this isn't the sort o'\nplace for a widow man and his children to stop in.  I'm just frightened\nto death o' going up and down the court.  I suppose you're not thinking\no' settling here, Mr Fleming?'\n\n'No, no,' said Fleming, shaking his head: 'a decent man couldn't stop\nhere, let alone a Christian.'\n\n'Well, then, come home to us till you can turn yourself round,'\ncontinued Mrs Blossom heartily; 'me and Mr George have talked it over,\nand he says, \"When little Meg's father do come, let 'em all come here:\nPosy, and the little 'uns, and all.  You'll have Posy and the little\n'uns in your room, and I'll have him in mine.  We'll give him some sort\no' a shakedown, and sailors don't use to lie soft.\" So if you've no\nobjections to raise, it's settled; and if you have, please to raise 'em\nat once.'\n\nRobert Fleming had no objections to raise, but he accepted the cordial\ninvitation thankfully, for he was in haste to get out of the miserable\nlife of Angel Court.  He brought the hidden box into the back attic,\nand opened it before little Meg, taking out of it the packet of forty\npounds, and a number of pawn-tickets, which he looked at very\nsorrowfully.  After securing these he locked up the attic again, and\ncarrying Meg in his arms, he led the way down the stairs, and through\nthe court, followed closely by Mrs Blossom, Posy, and Robin.  The sound\nof brawling and quarrelling was loud as usual, and the children\ncrawling about the pavement were dirty and squalid as ever; they\ngathered about Meg and her father, forming themselves into a dirty and\nragged procession to accompany them down to the street.  Little Meg\nlooked up to the high window of the attic, where she had watched so\noften and so long for her father's coming; and then she looked round,\nwith eyes full of pity, upon the wretched group about her; and closing\nher eyelids, her lips moving a little, but without any words which even\nher father could hear, she said in her heart, 'Pray God, bless\neverybody, and make them good.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. Little Meg's Farewell\n\nAbout a month after Robert Fleming's return Dr Christie paid a visit to\nMrs Blossom's little house.  He had been there before, but this was a\nspecial visit; and it was evident some important plan had to be decided\nupon.  Dr Christie came to hear what Mrs Blossom had to say about it.\n\n'Well, sir,' said Mrs Blossom, 'a woman of my years, as always lived in\none village all her life till I came to London, it do seem a great move\nto go across the sea.  But as you all think as it 'ud be a good thing\nfor Posy, and as Mr Fleming do wish little Meg and Robin to go along\nwith us, which are like my own children, and as he's to be in the same\nship, I'm not the woman to say No.  I'm a good hand at washing and\nironing, and sewing, and keeping a little shop, or anything else as\nturns up; and there's ten years' good work in me yet; by which time\nlittle Meg'll be a stout, grown-up young woman; to say nothing of Posy,\nwho's old enough to get her own living now.  I can't say as I like the\nsea, quite the contrairy; but I can put up with it; and Mr Fleming'll\nbe there to see as the ship goes all right, and doesn't lose hisself.\nSo I'll be ready by the time the ship's ready.'\n\nThey were all ready in time as Mrs Blossom had promised, for there were\nnot many preparations to be made.  Little Meg's red frock was taken out\nof pawn, with all the other things, and Mrs Blossom went down to her\nnative village to visit it for the last time; but Posy shrank from\nbeing seen there by the neighbours again.  She, and Meg, and Robin went\nonce more for a farewell look at Temple Gardens.  It was the first time\nshe had been in the streets since she had gone back to her mother, and\nshe seemed ashamed and alarmed at every eye that met hers.  When they\nstood looking at the river, with its swift, cruel current, Posy\nshivered and trembled until she was obliged to turn away and sit down\non a bench.  She was glad, she said, to get home again, and she would\ngo out no more till the day came when Mr George drove them all down to\nthe docks, with the few boxes which contained their worldly goods.\n\nDr Christie and his wife were down at the ship to see them off, and\nthey kissed Meg tenderly as they bade her farewell.  When the last\nminute was nearly come, Mr George took little Meg's small hand in his\nlarge one, and laid the other upon her head.\n\n'Little woman, tell us that verse again,' he said, 'that verse as\nyou've always gone and believed in, and acted on.'\n\n'That as mother and me heard preached from the streets?' asked Meg.\n\nMr George nodded silently.\n\n'It's quite true,' said little Meg, in a tone of perfect confidence,\n'because it's in the Bible, and Jesus said it.  Besides, God did\neverythink I asked Him.  \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good\ngifts unto your children: how much more shall your Father which is in\nheaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"'\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n",
