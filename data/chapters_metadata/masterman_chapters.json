She had but little sail, for the wind was so strong,\nthat the canvas would have been split into pieces by the furious blasts\nbefore which she was driven through the waves, which were very high, and\nfollowing her almost as fast as she darted through their boiling waters;\nsometimes heaving up her stern and sinking her bows down so deep into\nthe hollow of the sea, that it appeared as if she would have dived down\nunderneath the waves; but she was a fine vessel, and the captain was a\ngood seaman, who did what he considered best for the safety of his\nvessel, and then put his trust in that Providence who is ever watchful\nover us.\n\nThe captain stood before the wheel, watching the men who were steering\nthe ship; for when you are running before a heavy gale, it requires\ngreat attention to the helm: and as he looked around him and up at the\nheavens, he sang in a low voice the words of a sea song:\n\n  \"One wide water all around us,\n  All above us one black sky.\"\n\nAnd so it was with them;--they were in the middle of the Atlantic, not\nanother vessel to be seen, and the heavens were covered with black\nclouds, which were borne along furiously by the gale; the sea ran\nmountains high, and broke into large white foaming crests, while the\nfierce wind howled through the rigging of the vessel.\n\nBesides the captain of the ship and the two men at the wheel, there were\ntwo other personages on deck: one was a young lad about twelve years\nold, and the other a weather-beaten old seaman, whose grisly locks were\nstreaming in the wind, as he paced aft and looked over the taffrail of\nthe vessel.\n\nThe young lad, observing a heavy sea coming up to the stern of the\nvessel, caught hold of the old man's arm, crying out--\"Won't that great\nwave come into us, Ready?\"\n\n\"No, Master William, it will not: don't you see how the ship lifts her\nquarters to it?--and now it has passed underneath us.  But it might\nhappen, and then what would become of you, if I did not hold on, and\nhold you on also?  You would be washed overboard.\"\n\n\"I don't like the sea much, Ready; I wish we were safe on shore again,\"\nreplied the lad.  \"Don't the waves look as if they wished to beat the\nship all to pieces?\"\n\n\"Yes, they do; and they roar as if angry because they cannot bury the\nvessel beneath them: but I am used to them, and with a good ship like\nthis, and a good captain and crew, I don't care for them.\"\n\n\"But sometimes ships do sink, and then everybody is drowned.\"\n\n\"Yes; and very often the very ships sink which those on board think are\nmost safe.  We can only do our best, and after that we must submit to\nthe will of Heaven.\"\n\n\"What little birds are those flying about so close to the water?\"\n\n\"Those are Mother Carey's chickens.  You seldom see them except in a\nstorm, or when a storm is coming on.\"\n\nThe birds which William referred to were the stormy petrels.\n\n\"Were you ever shipwrecked on a desolate island like Robinson Crusoe?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master William, I have been shipwrecked; but I never heard of\nRobinson Crusoe.  So many have been wrecked and undergone great\nhardships, and so many more have never lived to tell what they have\nsuffered, that it's not very likely that I should have known that one\nman you speak of, out of so many.\"\n\n\"Oh! but it's all in a book which I have read.  I could tell you all\nabout it--and so I will when the ship is quiet again; but now I wish you\nwould help me down below, for I promised mamma not to stay up long.\"\n\n\"Then always keep your promise like a good lad,\" replied the old man;\n\"now give me your hand, and I'll answer for it that we will fetch the\nhatchway without a tumble; and when the weather is fine again, I'll tell\nyou how I was wrecked, and you shall tell me all about Robinson Crusoe.\"\n\nHaving seen William safe to the cabin door, the old seaman returned to\nthe deck, for it was his watch.\n\nMasterman Ready, for such was his name, had been more than fifty years\nat sea, having been bound apprentice to a collier which sailed from\nSouth Shields, when he was only ten years old.  His face was browned\nfrom long exposure, and there were deep furrows on his cheeks, but he\nwas still a hale and active man.  He had served many years on board of a\nman-of-war, and had been in every climate: he had many strange stories\nto tell, and he might be believed even when his stories were strange,\nfor he would not tell an untruth.  He could navigate a vessel, and, of\ncourse, he could read and write.  The name of Ready was very well suited\nto him, for he was seldom at a loss; and in cases of difficulty and\ndanger, the captain would not hesitate to ask his opinion, and\nfrequently take his advice.  He was second mate of the vessel.\n\nThe _Pacific_ was, as we have observed, a very fine ship, and well able\nto contend with the most violent storm.  She was of more than four\nhundred tons burthen, and was then making a passage out to New South\nWales, with a valuable cargo of English hardware, cutlery, and other\nmanufactures.  The captain was a good navigator and seaman, and moreover\na good man, of a cheerful, happy disposition, always making the best of\neverything, and when accidents did happen, always more inclined to laugh\nthan to look grave.  His name was Osborn.  The first mate, whose name\nwas Mackintosh, was a Scotsman, rough and ill-tempered, but paying\nstrict attention to his duty--a man that Captain Osborn could trust, but\nwhom he did not like.\n\nReady we have already spoken of, and it will not be necessary to say\nanything about the seamen on board, except that there were thirteen of\nthem, hardly a sufficient number to man so large a vessel; but just as\nthey were about to sail, five of the seamen, who did not like the\ntreatment they had received from Mackintosh, the first mate, had left\nthe ship, and Captain Osborn did not choose to wait until he could\nobtain others in their stead.  This proved unfortunate, as the events\nwhich we shall hereafter relate will show.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.\n\nMaster William, whom we have introduced to the reader, was the eldest\nboy of a family who were passengers on board, consisting of the father,\nmother, and four children: his father was a Mr Seagrave, a very\nwell-informed, clever man, who having for many years held an office\nunder government at Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, was now\nreturning from a leave of absence of three years.  He had purchased from\nthe government several thousand acres of land; it had since risen very\nmuch in value, and the sheep and cattle which he had put on it were\nproving a source of great profit.  His property had been well managed by\nthe person who had charge of it during his absence in England, and he\nwas now taking out with him a variety of articles of every description\nfor its improvement, and for his own use, such as furniture for his\nhouse, implements of agriculture, seeds, plants, cattle, and many other\nthings too numerous to mention.\n\nMrs Seagrave was an amiable woman, but not in very strong health.  The\nfamily consisted of William, who was the eldest, a clever, steady boy,\nbut, at the same time, full of mirth and humour; Thomas, who was six\nyears old, a very thoughtless but good-tempered boy, full of mischief,\nand always in a scrape; Caroline, a little girl of seven years; and\nAlbert, a fine strong little fellow, who was not one year old: he was\nunder the charge of a black girl, who had come from the Cape of Good\nHope to Sydney, and had followed Mrs Seagrave to England.  We have now\nmentioned all the people on board of the Pacific: perhaps we ought not\nto forget two shepherd's dogs, belonging to Mr Seagrave, and a little\nterrier, which was a great favourite of Captain Osborn, to whom she\nbelonged.\n\nIt was not until the fourth day from its commencement that the gale\nabated, and then it gradually subsided until it was nearly a calm.  The\nmen who had been watching night after night during the gale now brought\nall their clothes which had been drenched by the rain and spray, and\nhung them up in the rigging to dry: the sails, also, which had been\nfurled, and had been saturated by the wet, were now loosened and spread\nout that they might not be mildewed.  The wind blew mild and soft, the\nsea had gone down, and the ship was running through the water at the\nspeed of about four miles an hour.  Mrs Seagrave, wrapped up in a\ncloak, was seated upon one of the arm-chests near the stern of the ship,\nher husband and children were all with her enjoying the fine weather,\nwhen Captain Osborn, who had been taking an observation of the sun with\nhis sextant, came up to them.\n\n\"Well, Master Tommy, you are very glad that the gale is over?\"\n\n\"I didn't care,\" replied Tommy, \"only I spilt all my soup.  But Juno\ntumbled off her chair, and rolled away with the baby, till papa picked\nthem both up.\"\n\n\"It was a mercy that poor Albert was not killed,\" observed Mrs\nSeagrave.\n\n\"And so he might have been, if Juno had not thought only of him and\nnothing at all about herself,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"That's very true, sir,\" replied Captain Osborn.  \"She saved the child,\nand, I fear, hurt herself.\"\n\n\"I thump my head very hard,\" said Juno, smiling.\n\n\"Yes, and it's lucky that you have a good thick woolly coat over it,\"\nreplied Captain Osborn, laughing.\n\n\"It is 12 o'clock by the sun, sir,\" said Mackintosh, the first mate, to\nthe captain.\n\n\"Then bring me up the latitude, Mr Mackintosh, while I work out the\nlongitude from the sights which I took this morning.  In five minutes,\nMr Seagrave, I shall be ready to prick off over our place on the\nchart.\"\n\n\"Here are the dogs come up on deck,\" said William; \"I dare say they are\nas glad of the fine weather as we are.  Come here, Romulus!  Here,\nRemus!--Remus!\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Ready, who was standing by them with his quadrant in\nhis hand, \"I should like to ask you a question.  Those dogs of yours\nhave two very odd names which I never heard before.  Who were Romulus\nand Remus?\"\n\n\"Romulus and Remus,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"were the names of two\nshepherds, brothers, who in ancient days founded the city of Rome, which\neventually became the largest and most celebrated empire in the world.\nThey were the first kings of Rome, and reigned together.  History says\nthat Remus affronted Romulus by leaping over a wall he had raised, and\nRomulus, in his anger, took away his life; but the history of early days\nis not to be depended upon.\"\n\n\"No, nor the brothers either, it appears,\" replied Ready; \"however, it\nis the old story--two of a trade can never agree.  One sometimes hears\nof Rome now--is that the same place?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied William, \"it is the remains of the old city.\"\n\n\"Well, one lives and learns,\" said Ready.  \"I have learnt something\nto-day, which everyone will to the last day of his life, if he will only\nask questions.  I'm an old man, and perhaps don't know much, except in\nthe seafaring way; but I should have known much less if I did not ask\nfor information, and was not ashamed to acknowledge my ignorance; that's\nthe way to learn, Master William.\"\n\n\"Very good advice, Ready,--and, William, I hope you will profit by it,\"\nsaid Mr Seagrave; \"never be ashamed to ask the meaning of what you do\nnot understand.\"\n\n\"I always do, papa.  Do I not ask you questions, Ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, and very clever questions for a boy of your age; and I\nonly wish that I could answer them better than I can sometimes.\"\n\n\"I should like to go down now, my dear,\" said Mrs Seagrave; \"perhaps\nReady will see the baby down safe.\"\n\n\"That I will, ma'am,\" said Ready, putting his quadrant on the capstan:\n\"now, Juno, give me the child, and go down first;--backwards, you stupid\ngirl! how often do I tell you that?  Some day or another you will come\ndown with a run.\"\n\n\"And break my head,\" said Juno.\n\n\"Yes, or break your arm; and then who is to hold the child?\"\n\nAs soon as they were all down in the cabin, the captain and Mr Seagrave\nmarked the position of the vessel on the chart, and found that they were\none hundred and thirty miles from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n\"If the wind holds, we shall be in to-morrow,\" said Mr Seagrave to his\nwife.  \"Juno, perhaps you may see your father and mother.\"\n\nPoor Juno shook her head, and a tear or two stole down her dark cheek.\nWith a mournful face she told them, that her father and mother belonged\nto a Dutch boer, who had gone with them many miles into the interior:\nshe had been parted from them when quite a little child, and had been\nleft at Cape Town.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.\n\nThe next morning the _Pacific_ arrived at the Cape and anchored in Table\nBay.\n\n\"Why do they call this Table Bay, Ready?\" said William.\n\n\"I suppose it's because they call that great mountain the Table\nMountain, Master William; you see how flat the mountain is on the top.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is quite as flat as a table.\"\n\n\"Yes, and sometimes you will see the white clouds rolling down over the\ntop of it in a very curious manner, and that the sailors call spreading\nthe tablecloth: it is a sign of bad weather.\"\n\n\"Then I hope they will not spread the tablecloth while we are here,\nReady,\" said William, \"for I shall certainly have no appetite.  We have\nhad bad weather enough already, and mamma suffers so much from it.  What\na pretty place it is!\"\n\n\"We shall remain here two days, sir,\" said Captain Osborn to Mr\nSeagrave, \"if you and Mrs Seagrave would like to go on shore.\"\n\n\"I will go down and ask Mrs Seagrave,\" said her husband, who went down\nthe ladder, followed by William.\n\nUpon the question being put to Mrs Seagrave, she replied that she was\nquite satisfied with the ship having no motion, and did not feel herself\nequal to going on shore; it was therefore decided that she should remain\non board with the two younger children, and that, on the following day,\nMr Seagrave should take William and Tommy to see Cape Town, and return\non board before night.\n\nThe next morning, Captain Osborn lowered down one of the large boats,\nand Mr Seagrave, accompanied by Captain Osborn, went on shore with\nWilliam and Tommy.  Tommy had promised his mamma to be very good; but\nthat he always did, and almost always forgot his promise directly he was\nout of sight.  As soon as they landed, they went up to a gentleman's\nhouse, with whom Captain Osborn was acquainted.  They stayed for a few\nminutes to drink a glass of lemonade, for it was very warm; and then it\nwas proposed that they should go to the Company's Gardens and see the\nwild beasts which were confined there, at which William was much\ndelighted, and Tommy clapped his hands with joy.\n\n\"What are the Company's Gardens, papa?\" inquired William.\n\n\"They were made by the Dutch East India Company, at the time that the\nCape of Good Hope was in their possession.  They are, properly speaking,\nBotanical Gardens; but, at the same time, the wild animals are kept\nthere.  Formerly there were a great many, but they have not been paid\nattention to lately, for we have plenty of these animals in England\nnow.\"\n\n\"What shall we see?\" said Tommy.\n\n\"You will see lions, Tommy, a great many in a large den together,\" said\nCaptain Osborn.\n\n\"Oh!  I want to see a lion.\"\n\n\"You must not go too near them, recollect.\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" said Tommy.\n\nAs soon as they entered the gates, Tommy escaped from Captain Osborn,\nand ran away in his hurry to see the lions; but Captain Osborn caught\nhim again, and held him fast by the hand.\n\n\"Here is a pair of very strange birds,\" said the gentleman who\naccompanied them; \"they are called Secretaries, on account of the\nfeathers which hang behind their heads, as the feather of a pen does\nwhen a clerk puts it behind his ear: but they are very useful, for they\nare snake-killers; indeed, they would, if they could, live altogether\nupon snakes, which they are very great enemies to, never letting one\nescape.  They strike them with their feet, and with such force as to\nkill them immediately.\"\n\n\"Are there many snakes in this country?\" inquired William.\n\n\"Yes, and very venomous snakes,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"so that these\nbirds are very useful in destroying them.  You observe, William, that\nthe Almighty, in his wisdom, has so arranged it that no animal\n(especially of a noxious kind) shall be multiplied to excess, but kept\nunder by being preyed upon by some other; indeed, wherever in any\ncountry an animal exists in any quantity, there is generally found\nanother animal which destroys it.  The Secretary inhabits this country\nwhere snakes exist in numbers, that it may destroy them: in England the\nbird would be of little value.\"\n\n\"But some animals are too large or too fierce to be destroyed by others,\npapa; for instance, the elephant and the lion.\"\n\n\"Very true; but these larger animals do not breed so fast, and therefore\ntheir numbers do not increase so rapidly.  For instance, a pair of\nelephants will not have more than one young one in the space of two\nyears or more; while the rabbits, which are preyed upon and the food of\nso many other beasts as well as birds, would increase enormously, if\nthey were not destroyed.  Examine through the whole of creation, and you\nwill find that there is an unerring hand, which invariably preserves the\nbalance exact; and that there are no more mouths than for which food is\nprovided, although accidental circumstances may for a time occasion a\nslight alteration.\"\n\nThey continued their walk until they came to the den of the lions.  It\nwas a large place, in closed with a strong and high wall of stone, with\nonly one window to it for the visitors to look at them, as it was open\nabove.  This window was wide, and with strong iron bars running from the\ntop to the bottom; but the width between the bars was such that a lion\ncould put his paw out with ease; and they were therefore cautioned not\nto go too near.  It was a fine sight to see eight or ten of these\nnoble-looking animals lying down in various attitudes, quite indifferent\napparently to the people outside--basking in the sun, and slowly moving\ntheir tufted tails to and fro.  William examined them at a respectful\ndistance from the bars; and so did Tommy, who had his mouth open with\nastonishment, in which there was at first not a little fear mixed, but\nhe soon got bolder.  The gentleman who had accompanied them, and who had\nbeen long at the Cape, was relating to Mr Seagrave and Captain Osborn\nsome very curious anecdotes about the lion.  William and they were so\ninterested, that they did not perceive that Tommy had slipped back to\nthe grated window of the den.  Tommy looked at the lions, and then he\nwanted to make them move about: there was one fine full-grown young\nlion, about three years old, who was lying down nearest to the window;\nand Tommy took up a stone and threw it at him: the lion appeared not to\nnotice it, for he did not move, although he fixed his eyes upon Tommy;\nso Tommy became more brave, and threw another, and then another,\napproaching each time nearer to the bars of the window.\n\nAll of a sudden the lion gave a tremendous roar, and sprang at Tommy,\nbounding against the iron bars of the cage with such force that, had\nthey not been very strong, it must have broken them.  As it was, they\nshook and rattled so that pieces of mortar fell from the stones.  Tommy\nshrieked; and, fortunately for himself, fell back and tumbled head over\nheels, or the lion's paws would have reached him.  Captain Osborn and\nMr Seagrave ran up to Tommy, and picked him up: he roared with fright\nas soon as he could fetch his breath, while the lion stood at the bars,\nlashing his tail, snarling, and showing his enormous fangs.\n\n\"Take me away--take me on board the ship!\" cried Tommy, who was terribly\nfrightened.\n\n\"What did you do, Tommy?\" said Captain Osborn.\n\n\"I won't throw any more stones, Mr Lion; I won't indeed!\" cried Tommy,\nlooking terrified towards the animal.\n\nMr Seagrave scolded Tommy well for his foolish conduct, and by degrees\nhe became more composed; but he did not recover himself until they had\nwalked some distance away from the lion's den.\n\nThey then looked at the other animals which were to be seen, Tommy\nkeeping a most respectful distance from every one of them.  He wouldn't\neven go near to a Cape sheep with a broad tail.\n\nWhen they had seen everything, they went back to the gentleman's house\nto dinner; and, after dinner, they returned on board.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.\n\nThe following morning the fresh water and provisions were received on\nboard, and once more the _Pacific_ stretched her broad canvas to the\nwinds, and there was every prospect of a rapid voyage, as for many days\nshe continued her passage with a fair wind and flowing sheet.  But this\ndid not continue: it fell calm, and remained so for nearly three days,\nduring which not a breath of wind was to be seen on the wide expanse of\nwater; all nature appeared as if in repose, except that now and then an\nalbatross would drop down at some distance from the stern of the vessel,\nand, as he swam lazily along with his wings half-furled, pick up the\nfragments of food which had been thrown over the side.\n\n\"What great bird is that, Ready?\" inquired William.\n\n\"It is an albatross, the largest sea-bird we have.  Their wings are very\nlong.  I have seen them shot, and they have measured eleven feet from\nthe tip of one wing to the tip of the other when the wings have been\nspread out.\"\n\n\"It is the first one that I have seen,\" said William.\n\n\"Because you seldom meet them north of the Cape, sir: people do say that\nthey go to sleep on the wing, balancing themselves high up in the air.\"\n\n\"Papa,\" said William, turning to Mr Seagrave, who stood by, \"why is it\nthat one bird can swim and another cannot?  You recollect when Tommy\ndrove the hens into the large pond, they flounced about, and their\nfeathers became wet, and would support them no longer, and then they\nwere drowned.  Now, how does a sea-bird contrive to remain so long on\nthe water?\"\n\n\"Because a sea-bird, William, is provided with a sort of oil on purpose\nto anoint the outside of its feathers, and this oil prevents the water\nfrom penetrating them.  Have you not observed the ducks on shore\ndressing their feathers with their bills?  They were then using this oil\nto make their feathers waterproof.\"\n\n\"How odd!\"\n\n\"Don't say how odd, William; that is not an expression to use when we\ntalk of the wonderful provisions made by the Almighty hand, who neglects\nnot the meanest of his creatures--say rather, how wonderful!\"\n\n\"That's very true, sir,\" observed Ready; \"but still you must not be too\nhard upon Master William, for I have heard many a grownup man make use\nof the same expression.\"\n\nOn the third day of the calm, the barometer fell so low as to induce\nCaptain Osborn to believe that they should have a severe gale, and every\npreparation was made to meet it, should it come on.  Nor was he\nmistaken: towards midnight the clouds gathered up fast, and as they\ngathered up in thick piles, heaped one over the other, the lightning\ndarted through them in every direction; and as the clouds rose up, so\ndid the wind, but at first only in heavy gusts, and then lulling again\nto a calm.\n\n\"Ready,\" said Captain Osborn, \"how do you think we shall have the wind?\"\n\n\"Why, Captain Osborn, to tell you the truth, I don't think it will be\nsteady to one point long.  It may at first blow hard from the north, but\nit's my idea it will shift soon to some other quarter, and blow still\nharder.\"\n\n\"What think you, Mackintosh?\"\n\n\"We'll have plenty of it, and a long steady gale, that's my notion; and\nthe sooner we ship the dead lights the better.\"\n\nMr Seagrave, with William, happened to be standing by at the time of\nthis conversation, and at the term _dead_ lights Willy's face expressed\nsome anxiety.  Ready perceived it, and said--\n\n\"That's a foolish name they give to the shutters which go over the cabin\nwindows to prevent the water from breaking into the cabin when a vessel\nsails before the wind; you know we had them on the last time that we had\na gale.\"\n\n\"But, Ready,\" said Captain Osborn, \"why do you think that we shall have\na shift of wind?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know; perhaps I was wrong,\" replied the old man, \"and Mr\nMackintosh is right: the wind does seem to come steady from the\nnorth-east, that's certain;\" and Ready walked away to the binnacle, and\nlooked at the compass.  Mr Seagrave and William then went below, and\nMr Mackintosh went forward to give his orders.  As soon as they were\nall gone, Ready went up again to Captain Osborn and said:\n\n\"Captain Osborn, it's not for me to contradict Mr Mackintosh, but\nthat's of little consequence in a time like this: I should have held to\nmy opinion, had it not been that the gentleman passenger and his son\nwere standing by, but now, as the coast is clear, I tell you that we\nshall have something worse than a gale of wind.  I have been in these\nlatitudes before, and I am an old seaman, as you know.  There's\nsomething in the air, and there has been something during the last three\ndays of calm, which reminds me too well of what I have seen here before;\nand I am sure that we shall have little better than a hurricane, as far\nas wind goes--and worse in one point, that it will last much longer than\nhurricanes generally do.  I have been watching, and even the birds tell\nme so, and they are told by their nature, which is never mistaken.  That\ncalm has been nothing more than a repose of the winds previous to their\nbeing roused up to do their worst; and that is my real opinion?\"\n\n\"Well, and I'm inclined to agree with you, Ready; so we must send\ntopgallant yards down on deck, and all the small sails and lumber out of\nthe tops.  Get the trysail aft and bent, and lower down the gaff.  I\nwill go forward.\"\n\nTheir preparations were hardly complete before the wind had settled to a\nfierce gale from the north-east.  The sea rose rapidly; topsail after\ntopsail was furled; and by dusk the _Pacific_ was flying through the\nwater with the wind on her quarter, under reefed foresail and storm\nstaysail.  It was with difficulty that three men at the wheel could keep\nthe helm, such were the blows which the vessel received from the heavy\nseas on the quarter.  Not one seaman in the ship took advantage of his\nwatch below to go to sleep that night, careless as they generally are;\nthe storm was too dreadful.  About three o'clock in the morning the wind\nsuddenly subsided; it was but for a minute or two, and then it again\nburst on the vessel from another quarter of the compass, as Ready had\nforetold, splitting the foresail into fragments, which lashed and\nflogged the wind till they were torn away by it, and carried far to\nleeward.  The heavens above were of a pitchy darkness, and the only\nlight was from the creaming foam of the sea on every side.  The shift of\nwind, which had been to the west-north-west, compelled them to alter the\ncourse of the vessel, for they had no chance but to scud, as they now\ndid, under bare poles; but in consequence of the sea having taken its\nrun from the former wind, which had been north-east, it was, as sailors\ncall it, cross, and every minute the waves poured over the ship,\nsweeping all before their weight of waters.  One poor man was washed\noverboard, and any attempt made to save him would have been unavailing.\nCaptain Osborn was standing by the weather gunnel, holding on by one of\nthe belaying-pins, when he said to Mackintosh:\n\n\"How long will this last, think you?\"\n\n\"Longer than the ship will,\" replied the mate gravely.\n\n\"I should hope not,\" replied the captain; \"still it cannot look worse.\nWhat do you think, Ready?\"\n\n\"Far more fear from above than from below just now,\" replied Ready,\npointing to the yard-arms of the ship, to each of which were little\nballs of electric matter attached, flaring out to a point.  \"Look at\nthose two clouds, sir, rushing at each other; if I--\"\n\nReady had not time to finish what he would have said, before a blaze of\nlight, so dazzling that it left them all in utter darkness for some\nseconds afterwards, burst upon their vision, accompanied with a peal of\nthunder, at which the whole vessel trembled fore and aft.  A crash--a\nrushing forward--and a shriek were heard, and when they had recovered\ntheir eyesight, the foremast had been rent by the lightning as if it had\nbeen a lath, and the ship was in flames: the men at the wheel, blinded\nby the lightning, as well as appalled, could not steer; the ship\nbroached to--away went the mainmast over the side--and all was wreck,\nconfusion, and dismay.\n\nFortunately the heavy seas which poured over the forecastle soon\nextinguished the flames, or they all must have perished; but the ship\nlay now helpless, and at the mercy of the waves beating violently\nagainst the wrecks of the masts which floated to leeward, but were still\nheld fast to the vessel by their rigging.  As soon as they could recover\nfrom the shock, Ready and the first mate hastened to the wheel to try to\nget the ship before the wind; but this they could not do, as, the\nforemast and mainmast being gone, the mizenmast prevented her paying off\nand answering to the helm.  Ready, having persuaded two of the men to\ntake the helm, made a sign to Mackintosh (for now the wind was so loud\nthat they could not hear each other speak), and, going aft, they\nobtained axes, and cut away the mizen-rigging; the mizen-topmast and\nhead of the mizenmast went over the side, and then the stump of the\nforemast was sufficient to get the ship before the wind again.  Still\nthere was much delay and confusion, before they could clear away the\nwreck of the masts; and, as soon as they could make inquiry, they found\nthat four of the men had been killed by the lightning and the fall of\nthe foremast, and there were now but eight remaining, besides Captain\nOsborn and his two mates.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.\n\nSailors are never discouraged by danger as long as they have any chance\nof relieving themselves by their own exertions.  The loss of their\nshipmates, so instantaneously summoned away,--the wrecked state of the\nvessel,--the wild surges burying them beneath their angry waters,--the\nhowling of the wind, the dazzling of the lightning, and the pealing of\nthe thunder, did not prevent them from doing what their necessity\ndemanded.  Mackintosh, the first mate, rallied the men, and contrived to\nfix a block and strap to the still smoking stump of the foremast; a rope\nwas rove through the block, and the main-topgallant sail hoisted, so\nthat the vessel might run faster before the gale, and answer her helm\nbetter than she did.\n\nThe ship was again before the wind, and comparatively safe,\nnotwithstanding the heavy blows she now received from the pursuing\nwaves.  Night again came on, but there was no repose, and the men were\nworn out with exposure and fatigue.\n\nThe third day of the gale dawned, but the appearances were as alarming\nas ever: the continual breaking of the seas over the stern had washed\naway the binnacles, and it was impossible now to be certain of the\ncourse the ship had been steered, or the distance which had been run;\nthe leaky state of the vessel proved how much she had already suffered\nfrom the violent shocks which she had received, and the certainty was\napparent, that if the weather did not abate, she could not possibly\nwithstand the force of the waves much longer.\n\nThe countenance of Captain Osborn showed great anxiety: he had a heavy\nresponsibility on his shoulders--he might lose a valuable ship, and\nstill more valuable cargo, even if they did not all lose their lives;\nfor they were now approaching where the sea was studded with low coral\nislands, upon which they might be thrown by the waves and wind, without\nhaving the slightest power to prevent it in their present disabled\ncondition.\n\nReady was standing by him when Captain Osborn said--\n\n\"I don't much like this, Ready; we are now running on danger and have no\nhelp for it.\"\n\n\"That's true enough,\" replied Ready: \"we have no help for it; it is\nGod's will, sir, and His will be done.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" replied Captain Osborn solemnly; and then he continued, after a\npause, \"There were many captains who envied me when I obtained command\nof this fine ship,--would they change with me now?\"\n\n\"I should rather think not, Captain Osborn, but you never know what the\nday may bring forth.  You sailed with this vessel, full of hope--you\nnow, not without reason, feel something approaching to despair; but who\nknows? it may please the Almighty to rebuke those angry winds and waves,\nand to-morrow we may again hope for the best; at all events you have\ndone your duty--no man can do more.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Captain Osborn; \"but hold hard, Ready, that\nsea's aboard of us.\"\n\nReady had just time to cling with both hands to the belaying-pins when\nthe sea poured over the vessel, with a volume of water which for some\ntime swept them off their legs: they clung on firmly, and at last\nrecovered their feet.\n\n\"She started a timber or two with that blow, I rather think,\" said\nReady.\n\n\"I'm afraid so; the best vessel ever built could not stand such shocks\nlong,\" replied Captain Osborn; \"and at present, with our weak crew, I do\nnot see that we can get more sail upon her.\"\n\nAll that night the ship flew in darkness before the gale.  At daybreak\nthe wind abated, and the sea went down: the ship was, however, still\nkept before the wind, for she had suffered too much to venture to put\nher broadside to the sea.  Preparations were now made for getting up\njury-masts; and the worn-out seamen were busily employed, under the\ndirection of Captain Osborn and his two mates, when Mr Seagrave and\nWilliam came upon deck.\n\nWilliam stared about him: he perceived, to his astonishment, that the\ntall masts, with all their rigging and sails, had disappeared, and that\nthe whole deck was in a state of confusion and disorder.\n\n\"See, my child,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"the wreck and devastation which are\nhere.  See how the pride of man is humbled before the elements of the\ngreat Jehovah.\"\n\n\"Ay, Master Willy,\" said old Ready, \"look around you, as you well may.\nDo you remember the verses in the Bible?--if not, I remember them well,\nfor I have often read them, and have often felt the truth of them: `They\nthat go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters,\nthese see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.'\"\n\n\"But, father,\" said Willy, after a pause, \"how shall we ever get to\nSydney without masts or sails?\"\n\n\"Why, William,\" replied Ready, \"we must do what we can: we sailors are\nnever much at a loss, and I dare say before night you will find us under\nsome sort of sail again.  We have lost our great masts, so we must put\nup jury-masts, as we call them; that is, little ones, and little sails\nupon them; and, if it pleases God, we shall see Sydney yet.  How is\nMadam, sir?\" continued Ready to Mr Seagrave.  \"Is she better?\"\n\n\"I fear she is very weak and ill,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"nothing but\nfine weather will do her any good.  Do you think that it will be fine\nnow?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, to tell you the truth, I fear we shall have more of it yet: I\nhave not given my thoughts to the captain, as I might be mistaken; but\nstill I think so--I've not been fifty years at sea without learning\nsomething.  I don't like the gathering of that bank there, Mr Seagrave,\nand I shouldn't wonder if it were to blow again from the very same\nquarter, and that before dark.\"\n\n\"God's will be done,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"but I am very fearful about\nmy poor wife, who is worn to a shadow.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think so much about that, sir, as I really never knew of\npeople dying that way, although they suffer much.  William, do you know\nthat we have lost some of our men since you were down below?\"\n\n\"No--I heard the steward say something outside about the foremast.\"\n\n\"We have lost five of our smartest and best men--Wilson was washed\noverboard, Fennings and Masters struck dead with the lightning, and\nJones and Emery crushed by the fall of the foremast.  You are young,\nMaster Willy, but you cannot think too early of your Maker, or call to\nmind what they say in the burial service,--`In the midst of life we are\nin death.'\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ready, for the lesson you have given my son,\" said Mr\nSeagrave; \"and, William, treasure it up in your memory.\"\n\n\"Yes, William, they are the words of an old man who has seen many and\nmany a one who was full of youth and spirits called away before him, and\nwho is grateful to God that he has been pleased to preserve his life,\nand allow him to amend his ways.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking,\" said Mr Seagrave, after a silence of a minute\nor two, \"that a sailor has no right to marry.\"\n\n\"I've always thought so, sir,\" replied Ready; \"and I dare say many a\npoor deserted sailor's wife, when she has listened to the wind and rain\nin her lonely bed, has thought the same.\"\n\n\"With my permission,\" continued Mr Seagrave, \"my boys shall never go to\nsea if there is any other profession to be found for them.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Seagrave, they do say that it's no use baulking a lad if he\nwishes to go to sea, and that if he is determined, he must go: now I\nthink otherwise--I think a parent has a right to say no, if he pleases,\nupon that point; for you see, sir, a lad, at the early age at which he\ngoes to sea, does not know his own mind.  Every high-spirited boy wishes\nto go to sea--it's quite natural; but if the most of them were to speak\nthe truth, it is not that they so much want to go to sea, as that they\nwant to go from school or from home, where they are under the control of\ntheir masters or their parents.\"\n\n\"Very true, Ready; they wish to be, as they consider they will be,\nindependent.\"\n\n\"And a pretty mistake they make of it, sir.  Why, there is not a greater\nslave in the world than a boy who goes to sea, for the first few years\nafter his shipping: for once they are corrected on shore, they are\npunished ten times at sea, and they never again meet with the love and\naffection they have left behind them.  It is a hard life, and there have\nbeen but few who have not bitterly repented it, and who would not have\nreturned, like the prodigal son, and cast themselves at their fathers'\nfeet, only that they have been ashamed.\"\n\n\"That's the truth, Ready, and it is on that account that I consider that\na parent is justified in refusing his consent to his son going to sea,\nif he can properly provide for him in any other profession.  There never\nwill be any want of sailors, for there always will be plenty of poor\nlads whose friends can do no better for them; and in that case the\nseafaring life is a good one to choose, as it requires no other capital\nfor their advancement than activity and courage.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6.\n\nMr Seagrave and William went down below into the cabin, where they\nfound that there was plenty of employment; the steward had brought a\nbasin of very hot pea-soup for the children.  Tommy, who was sitting up\nin the bed-place with his sister, had snatched it out of Juno's left\nhand, for she held the baby with the other, and in so doing, had thrown\nit over Caroline, who was screaming, while Juno, in her hurry to assist\nCaroline, had slipped down on the deck with the baby, who was also\ncrying with fright, although not hurt.  Unfortunately, Juno had fallen\ndown upon Vixen the terrier, who in return had bitten her in the leg,\nwhich had made Juno also cry out; while Mrs Seagrave was hanging her\nhead out of her standing bed-place, frightened out of her wits at the\naccident, but unable to be of any assistance.  Fortunately, Mr Seagrave\ncame down just in time to pick up Juno and the baby, and then tried to\ncomfort little Caroline, who after all was not much scalded, as the soup\nhad had time to cool.\n\n\"Massa Tommy is a very naughty boy,\" cried Juno, rubbing her leg.\nMaster Tommy thought it better to say nothing--he was duly admonished--\nthe steward cleaned up the mess, and order was at length restored.\n\nIn the meantime, they were not idle upon deck; the carpenter was busy\nfixing a step for one of the spare topmasts instead of a mainmast, and\nthe men were fitting the rigging; the ship unfortunately had sprung a\nleak, and four hands at the pumps interfered very much with their task.\nAs Ready had prophesied, before night the gale blew, the sea rose again\nwith the gale, and the leaking of the vessel increased so much, that all\nother labour was suspended for that at the pump.  For two more days did\nthe storm continue, during which time the crew were worn out with\nfatigue--they could pump no longer: the ship, as she rolled, proved that\nshe had a great deal of water in her hold--when, melancholy as were\ntheir prospects already, a new disaster took place, which was attended\nwith most serious results.  Captain Osborn was on the forecastle giving\nsome orders to the men, when the strap of the block which hoisted up the\nmain-topgallant yard on the stump of the foremast gave way, the yard and\nsail came down on the deck, and struck him senseless.  As long as\nCaptain Osborn commanded them, the sailors had so high an opinion of his\nabilities as a seaman, and were so encouraged by his cheerful\ndisposition, that they performed their work well and cheerfully; but now\nthat he was, if not killed, at all events senseless and incapable of\naction, they no longer felt themselves under control.  Mackintosh was\ntoo much disliked by the seamen to allow his words to have any weight\nwith them.  They were regardless of his injunctions or requests, and\nthey now consulted among themselves.\n\n\"The gale is broke, my men, and we shall have fine weather now,\"\nobserved Ready, going up to the sailors on the forecastle.  \"The wind is\ngoing down fast.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied one of the men, \"and the ship is going down fast, that's\nquite as certain.\"\n\n\"A good spell at the pumps would do us some good now,\" replied Ready.\n\"What d'ye say, my lads?\"\n\n\"A glass of grog or two would do us more,\" replied the seaman.  \"What\nd'ye say, my boys?  I don't think that the captain would refuse us, poor\nfellow, if he could speak.\"\n\n\"What do you mean to do, my lads?\" inquired Mackintosh: \"not get drunk,\nI hope?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" observed another of the men; \"the ship must go down soon.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she may--I will not deny it,\" said Mackintosh; \"but that is no\nreason why we should not be saved: now, if you get drunk, there is no\nchance of any one being saved, and my life is precious to me.  I'm ready\nto join with you in anything you please, and you may decide what is to\nbe done; but get drunk you shall not, if I can help it, that's certain.\"\n\n\"And how can you help it?\" replied one of the seamen, surlily.\n\n\"Because two resolute men can do a great deal--I may say three, for in\nthis instance Ready will be of my side, and I can call to my assistance\nthe cabin passenger--recollect the firearms are all in the cabin.  But\nwhy should we quarrel?--Say at once what you intend to do; and if you\nhave not made up your minds, will you listen to what I propose?\"\n\nAs Mackintosh's courage and determination were well known, the seamen\nagain consulted together, and then asked him what he proposed.\n\n\"We have one good boat left, the new yawl at the booms: the others, as\nyou know, are washed away, with the exception of the little boat astern,\nwhich is useless, as she is knocked almost to pieces.  Now we cannot be\nvery far from some of the islands, indeed I think we are among them now.\nLet us fit out the boat with everything we require, go about our work\nsteadily and quietly, drink as much grog as will not hurt us, and take a\ngood provision of it with us.  The boat is complete with her masts,\nsails, and oars; and it's very hard if we do not save ourselves\nsomewhere.  Ready, do I give good advice or not?\"\n\n\"You give very good advice, Mackintosh--only what is to become of the\ncabin passengers, the women, and children? and are you going to leave\npoor Captain Osborn? or what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"We won't leave the captain,\" said one of the seamen.\n\n\"No--no!\" exclaimed the others.\n\n\"And the passengers?\"\n\n\"Very sorry for them,\" replied the former spokesman; \"but we shall have\nenough to do to save our own lives.\"\n\n\"Well, my lads, I agree with you,\" said Mackintosh.  \"Charity begins at\nhome.  What do you say?--shall it be so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the seamen, unanimously; and Ready knew that it was in\nvain to expostulate.  They now set about preparing the boat, and\nproviding for their wants.  Biscuits, salt pork, two or three small\ncasks of water, and a barrel of rum were collected at the gangway;\nMackintosh brought up his quadrant and a compass, some muskets, powder\nand shot; the carpenter, with the assistance of another man, cut away\nthe ship's bulwarks down to the gunnel, so as to enable them to launch\nthe boat overboard, for they could not, of course, hoist her out now\nthat the masts were gone.  In an hour everything was prepared.  A long\nrope was made fast to the boat, which was brought to the gunnel ready\nfor launching overboard, and the ship's broadside was brought to the\nwind.  As this was done, Mr Seagrave came on deck and looked around\nhim.\n\nHe perceived the boat ready for launching, the provisions and water at\nthe gangway, the ship brought to the wind, and rolling slowly to the\nheave of the sea; at last he saw Ready sitting down by Captain Osborn,\nwho was apparently dead.  \"What is all this, Ready?\" inquired Seagrave.\n\"Are they going to leave the ship? have they killed Captain Osborn?\"\n\n\"No, sir,--not quite so bad as that.  Poor Captain Osborn was struck\ndown by the fall of the yard, and has been insensible ever since; but,\nas to the other matter, I fear that is decided: you see they are\nlaunching the boat.\"\n\n\"But my poor wife, she will never be able to go--she cannot move--she is\nso ill!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid, Mr Seagrave, that they have no idea of taking either you,\nor your wife, or your children, with them.\"\n\n\"What! leave us here to perish!  Merciful Heaven! how cruel--how\nbarbarous!\"\n\n\"It is not kind, Mr Seagrave, but still you see it is the law of\nnature.  When it is a question of life, it is every one for himself, for\nlife is sweet: they are not more unkind than they would be to each\nother, if there were too many for the boat to hold.  I've seen all this\nbefore in my time,\" replied Ready, gravely.\n\n\"My wife! my children!\" cried Mr Seagrave, covering his face with his\nhands.  \"But I will speak to them,\" continued he after a pause; \"surely\nthey will listen to the dictates of humanity; at all events Mr\nMackintosh will have some power over them.  Don't you think so, Ready?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Seagrave, if I must speak, I confess to you that there is not\na harder heart among them than that of Mr Mackintosh, and it's useless\nspeaking to him or any one of them; and you must not be too severe upon\nthem neither: the boat is small, and could not hold more people with the\nprovisions which they take with them--that is the fact.  If they were to\ntake you and your family into the boat, it might be the cause of all\nperishing together; if I thought otherwise I would try what I could do\nto persuade them, but it is useless.\"\n\n\"What must be done, then, Ready?\"\n\n\"We must put our trust in a merciful God, Mr Seagrave, who will dispose\nof us as he thinks fit.\"\n\n\"We must?  What! do not you go with them?\"\n\n\"No, Mr Seagrave.  I have been thinking about it this last hour, and I\nhave made up my mind to remain with you.  They intend to take poor\nCaptain Osborn with them, and give him a chance, and have offered to\ntake me; but I shall stay here.\"\n\n\"To perish?\" replied Mr Seagrave, with surprise.\n\n\"As God pleases, Mr Seagrave.  I am an old man, and it is of little\nconsequence.  I care little whether I am taken away a year or two\nsooner, but I do not like to see blossoms cut off in early spring: I may\nbe of use if I remain, for I've an old head upon my shoulders, and I\ncould not leave you all to perish when you might be saved if you only\nknew how to act.  But here the seamen come--the boat is all ready, and\nthey will now take poor Captain Osborn with them.\"\n\nThe sailors came aft, and lifted up the still insensible captain.  As\nthey were going away one of them said, \"Come, Ready, there's no time to\nlose.\"\n\n\"Never mind me, Williams; I shall stick to the ship,\" replied Ready.  \"I\nwish you success with all my heart; and, Mr Mackintosh, I have but one\npromise to exact from you, and I hope you will not refuse me: which is,\nthat if you are saved, you will not forget those you leave here on\nboard, and take measures for their being searched for among the\nislands.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Ready! come into the boat,\" replied the first mate.\n\n\"I shall stay here, Mr Mackintosh; and I only beg that you will promise\nme what I ask.  Acquaint Mr Seagrave's friends with what has happened,\nand where it is most likely we may be found, if it please God to save\nus.  Do you promise me that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, if you are determined to stay; but,\" continued he, going up\nto Ready, and whispering to him, \"it is madness:--come away, man!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr Mackintosh,\" replied Ready, extending his hand.  \"You\nwill keep your promise?\"\n\nAfter much further expostulation on the part of Mackintosh and the\nseamen, to which Ready gave a deaf ear, the boat was pushed off, and\nthey made sail to the north-east.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7.\n\nFor some time after the boat had shoved off from the ship, old Ready\nremained with his arms folded, watching it in silence.  Mr Seagrave\nstood by him; his heart was too full for utterance, for he imagined that\nas the boat increased her distance from the vessel, so did every ray of\nhope depart, and that his wife and children, himself, and the old man\nwho was by his side were doomed to perish.  His countenance was that of\na man in utter despair.  At last old Ready spoke.\n\n\"They think that they will be saved and that we must perish, Mr\nSeagrave; they forget that there is a Power above, who will himself\ndecide that point--a power compared to which the efforts of weak man are\nas nought.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Mr Seagrave, in a low voice; \"but still what chance we\ncan have on a sinking ship, with so many helpless creatures around us, I\nconfess I cannot imagine.\"\n\n\"We must do our best, and submit to His will,\" replied Ready, who then\nwent aft, and shifted the helm, so as to put the ship again before the\nwind.\n\nAs the old man had foretold to the seamen before they quitted the\nvessel, the gale was now over, and the sea had gone down considerably.\nThe ship, however, dragged but slowly through the water, and after a\nshort time Ready lashed the wheel, and went forward.  On his return to\nthe quarter-deck, he found Mr Seagrave had thrown himself down\n(apparently in a state of despair) upon the sail on which Captain Osborn\nhad been laid after his accident.\n\n\"Mr Seagrave, do not give way,\" said Ready; \"if I thought our situation\nhopeless, I would candidly say so; but there always is hope, even at the\nvery worst,--and there always ought to be trust in that God without\nwhose knowledge not a sparrow falls to the ground.  But, Mr Seagrave, I\nshall speak as a seaman, and tell you what our probabilities are.  The\nship is half-full of water, from her seams having opened by the\nstraining in the gale, and the heavy blows which she received; but, now\nthat the gale has abated, she has recovered herself very much.  I have\nsounded the well, and find that she has not made many inches within the\nlast two hours, and probably, as she closes her seams, will make less.\nIf, therefore, it pleases God that the fine weather should continue,\nthere is no fear of the vessel sinking under us for some time; and as we\nare now amongst the islands, it is not impossible, nay, it is very\nprobable, that we may be able to run her ashore, and thus save our\nlives.  I thought of all this when I refused to go in the boat, and I\nthought also, Mr Seagrave, that if you were to have been deserted by me\nas well as by all the rest, you would have been unable yourself to take\nadvantage of any chances which might turn up in your favour, and\ntherefore I have remained, hoping, under God's providence, to be the\nmeans of assisting you and your family in this sore position.  I think\nnow it would be better that you should go down into the cabin, and with\na cheerful face encourage poor Mrs Seagrave with the change in the\nweather, and the hopes of arriving in some place of safety.  If she does\nnot know that the men have quitted the ship, do not tell her; say that\nthe steward is with the other men, which will be true enough, and, if\npossible, leave her in the dark as to what has taken place.  Master\nWilliam can be trusted, and if you will send him here to me, I will talk\nto him.\"\n\n\"I hardly know what to think, Ready, or how sufficiently to thank you\nfor your self-devotion, if I may so term it, in this exigency.  That\nyour advice is excellent and that I shall follow it, you may be assured;\nand, should we be saved from the death which at present stares us in the\nface, my gratitude--\"\n\n\"Do not speak of that, sir; I am an old man with few wants, and whose\nlife is of little use now.  All I wish to feel is, that I am trying to\ndo my duty in that situation into which it has pleased God to call me.\nWhat can this world offer to one who has roughed it all his life, and\nwho has neither kith nor kin that he knows of to care about his death?\"\n\nMr Seagrave pressed the hand of Ready, and went down without making any\nreply.  He found that his wife had been asleep for the last hour, and\nwas not yet awake.  The children were also quiet in their beds.  Juno\nand William were the only two who were sitting up.\n\nWilliam made a sign to his father that his mother was asleep, and then\nsaid in a whisper, \"I did not like to leave the cabin while you were on\ndeck, but the steward has not been here these two hours: he went to milk\nthe goat for baby and has not returned.  We have had no breakfast, none\nof us.\"\n\n\"William, go on deck,\" replied his father; \"Ready wishes to speak to\nyou.\"\n\nWilliam went on deck to Ready, who explained to him the position in\nwhich they were placed; he pointed out to him the necessity of his doing\nall he could to assist his father and him, and not to alarm his mother\nin her precarious state of health.  William, who, as it may be expected,\nlooked very grave, did, however, immediately enter into Ready's views,\nand proceeded to do his best.  \"The steward,\" said he, \"has left with\nthe other men, and when my mother wakes she will ask why the children\nhave had no breakfast.  What can I do?\"\n\n\"I think you can milk one of the goats if I show you how, while I go and\nget the other things ready; I can leave the deck, for you see the ship\nsteers herself very nicely;--and, William, I have sounded the well just\nbefore you came up, and I don't think she makes much water; and,\"\ncontinued he, looking round him, and up above, \"we shall have fine\nweather, and a smooth sea before night.\"\n\nBy the united exertions of Ready and William the breakfast was prepared\nwhile Mrs Seagrave still continued in a sound sleep.  The motion of the\nship was now very little: she only rolled very slowly from one side to\nthe other; the sea and wind had gone down, and the sun shone brightly\nover their heads; the boat had been out of sight some time, and the ship\ndid not go through the water faster than three miles an hour, for she\nhad no other sail upon her than the main-topgallant sail hoisted up on\nthe stump of the foremast.  Ready, who had been some time down in the\ncabin, proposed to Mr Seagrave that Juno and all the children should go\non deck.  \"They cannot be expected to be quiet, sir; and, now that Madam\nis in such a sweet sleep, it would be a pity to wake her.  After so much\nfatigue she may sleep for hours, and the longer the better, for you know\nthat (in a short time, I trust) she will have to exert herself.\"  Mr\nSeagrave agreed to the good sense of this proposal, and went on deck\nwith Juno and the children, leaving William in the cabin to watch his\nmother.  Poor Juno was very much astonished when she came up the ladder\nand perceived the condition of the vessel, and the absence of the men;\nbut Mr Seagrave told her what had happened, and cautioned her against\nsaying a word to Mrs Seagrave.  Juno promised that she would not; but\nthe poor girl perceived the danger of their position, and, as she\npressed little Albert to her bosom, a tear or two rolled down her\ncheeks.  Even Tommy and Caroline could not help asking where the masts\nand sails were, and what had become of Captain Osborn.\n\n\"Look there, sir,\" said Ready, pointing out some floating sea-weed to\nMr Seagrave.\n\n\"I perceive it,\" said Mr Seagrave; \"but what then?\"\n\n\"That by itself would not be quite proof,\" replied Ready, \"but we\nsailors have other signs and tokens.  Do you see those birds hovering\nover the waves?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, those birds never go far from land, that's all: and now,\nsir, I'll go down for my quadrant; for, although I cannot tell the\nlongitude just now, at all events I can find out the latitude we are in,\nand then by looking at the chart shall be able to give some kind of\nguess whereabout we are, if we see land soon.\n\n\"It is nearly noon now,\" observed Ready, reading off his quadrant, \"the\nsun rises very slowly.  What a happy thing a child is!  Look, sir, at\nthose little creatures playing about, and as merry now, and as unaware\nof danger, as if they were at home in their parlour.  I often think,\nsir, it is a great blessing for a child to be called away early; and\nthat it is selfish in parents to repine.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is,\" replied Mr Seagrave, looking mournfully at his\nchildren.\n\n\"It's twelve o'clock, sir.  I'll just go down and work the latitude, and\nthen I'll bring up the chart.\"\n\nMr Seagrave remained on deck.  He was soon in deep and solemn thought;\nnor was it to be wondered at--the ship a wreck and deserted--left alone\non the wide water with his wife and helpless family, with but one to\nassist him: had that one deserted as well as the rest, what would have\nbeen his position then?  Utter helplessness!  And now what had they to\nexpect?  Their greatest hopes were to gain some island, and, if they\nsucceeded, perhaps a desert island, perhaps an island inhabited by\nsavages--to be murdered, or to perish miserably of hunger and thirst.\nIt was not until some time after these reflections had passed through\nhis mind, that Mr Seagrave could recall himself to a sense of\nthankfulness to the Almighty for having hitherto preserved them, or\ncould say with humility, \"O Lord! thy will, not mine, be done.\"  But,\nhaving once succeeded in repressing his murmurs, he then felt that he\nhad courage and faith to undergo every trial which might be imposed upon\nhim.\n\n\"Here is the chart, sir,\" said Ready, \"and I have drawn a pencil line\nthrough our latitude: you perceive that it passes through this cluster\nof islands; and I think we must be among them, or very near.  Now I must\nput something on for dinner, and then look sharp out for the land.  Will\nyou take a look round, Mr Seagrave, especially a-head and on the bows?\"\n\nReady went down to see what he could procure for dinner, as the seamen,\nwhen they left the ship, had collected almost all which came first to\nhand.  He soon procured a piece of salt beef and some potatoes, which he\nput into the saucepan, and then returned on deck.\n\nMr Seagrave was forward, looking over the bows, and Ready went there to\nhim.\n\n\"Ready, I think I see something, but I can hardly tell what it is: it\nappears to be in the air, and yet it is not clouds.  Look there, where I\npoint my finger.\"\n\n\"You're right, sir,\" replied Ready, \"there is something; it is not the\nland which you see, but it is the trees upon the land which are\nrefracted, as they call it, so as to appear, as you say, as if they were\nin the air.  That is an island, sir, depend upon it; but I will go down\nand get my glass.\"\n\n\"It is the land, Mr Seagrave,\" said Ready, after examining it with his\nglass--\"yes, it is so,\" continued he, musing; \"I wish that we had seen\nit earlier; and yet we must be thankful.\"\n\n\"Why so, Ready?\"\n\n\"Only, sir, as the ship forges so slowly through the water, I fear that\nwe shall not reach it before dark, and I should have wished to have had\ndaylight to have laid her nicely on it.\"\n\n\"There is very little wind now.\"\n\n\"Well, let us hope that there will be more,\" replied Ready; \"if not, we\nmust do our best.  But I must now go to the helm, for we must steer\nright for the island; it would not do to pass it, for, Mr Seagrave,\nalthough the ship does not leak so much as she did, yet I must now tell\nyou that I do not think that she could be kept more than twenty-four\nhours above water.  I thought otherwise this morning when I sounded the\nwell; but when I went down in the hold for the beef, I perceived that we\nwere in more danger than I had any idea of; however, there is the land,\nand every chance of escape; so let us thank the Lord for all his\nmercies.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\nReady went to the helm and steered a course for the land, which was not\nso far distant as he had imagined, for the island was very low: by\ndegrees the wind freshened up, and they went faster through the water;\nand now, the trees, which had appeared as if in the air, joined on to\nthe land, and they could make out that it was a low coral island covered\nwith groves of cocoa-nuts.  Occasionally Ready gave the helm up to Mr\nSeagrave, and went forward to examine.  When they were within three or\nfour miles of it, Ready came back from the forecastle and said, \"I think\nI see my way pretty clear, sir: you see we are to the windward of the\nisland, and there is always deep water to the windward of these sort of\nisles, and reefs and shoals to leeward; we must, therefore, find some\nlittle cleft in the coral rock to dock her in, as it were, or she may\nfall back into deep water after she has taken the ground, for sometimes\nthese islands run up like a wall, with forty or fifty fathom of water\nclose to the weather-sides of them; but I see a spot where I think she\nmay be put on shore with safety.  You see those three cocoa-nut trees\nclose together on the beach?  Now, sir, I cannot well see them as I\nsteer, so do you go forward, and if I am to steer more to the right, put\nout your right hand, and if to the left, the same with your left; and\nwhen the ship's head is as it ought to be, then drop the hand which you\nhave raised.\"\n\n\"I understand, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave; who then went forward and\ndirected the steering of the vessel as they neared the island.  When\nthey were within half a mile of it, the colour of the water changed,\nvery much to the satisfaction of Ready, who knew that the weather-side\nof the island would not be so steep as was usually the case: still it\nwas an agitating moment as they ran on to beach.  They were now within a\ncable's length, and still the ship did not ground; a little nearer, and\nthere was a grating at her bottom--it was the breaking off of the\ncoral-trees which grew below like forests under water--again she grated,\nand more harshly, then struck, and then again; at last she struck\nviolently, as the swell lifted her further on, and then remained fast\nand quiet.  Ready let go the helm to ascertain the position of the ship.\nHe looked over the stern and around the ship, and found that she was\nfirmly fixed, fore and aft, upon a bed of coral rocks.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8.\n\n\"All's well so far, sir,\" said Ready to Mr Seagrave; \"and now let us\nreturn thanks to Heaven.\"\n\nAs they rose to their feet again, after giving thanks to the Almighty,\nWilliam came up and said, \"Father, my mother was awakened by the noise\nunder the ship's bottom, and is frightened--will you go down to her?\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear,--and where have you all been?\" exclaimed\nMrs Seagrave, when her husband went down below.  \"I have been so\nfrightened--I was in a sound sleep, and I was awakened with such a\ndreadful noise.\"\n\n\"Be composed, my dear,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"we have been in great\ndanger, and are now, I trust, in safety.  Tell me, are you not better\nfor your long sleep?\"\n\n\"Yes, much better--much stronger; but do tell me what has happened.\"\n\n\"Much took place, dearest, before you went to sleep, which was concealed\nfrom you; but now, as I expect we shall all go on shore in a short\ntime--\"\n\n\"Go on shore, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, on shore.  Now be calm, and hear what has happened, and how much\nwe have reason to be grateful to Heaven.\"\n\nMr Seagrave then entered into a detail of all that had passed.  Mrs\nSeagrave heard him without reply; and when he had finished, she threw\nherself in his arms and wept bitterly.  Mr Seagrave remained with his\nwife, using all his efforts to console her, until Juno reappeared with\nthe children, for it was now getting late; then he returned on deck.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Ready, when Mr Seagrave went up to him, \"I have been\nlooking well about me, and I think that we have great reason to be\nthankful.  The ship is fast enough, and will not move until some violent\ngales come on and break her up; but of that there is no fear at present:\nthe little wind that there is, is going down, and we shall have a calm\nbefore morning.\"\n\n\"I grant that there is no immediate danger, Ready; but how are we to get\non shore?--and, when on shore, how are we to exist?\"\n\n\"I have thought of that too, sir, and I must have your assistance, and\neven that of Master William, to get the little boat on board to repair\nher: her bottom is stove in, it is true, but I am carpenter enough for\nthat, and with some well-tarred canvas I can make her sufficiently\nwater-tight to land us all in safety.  We must set to at daylight.\"\n\n\"And when we get on shore?\"\n\n\"Why, Mr Seagrave, where there are cocoa-nut trees in such plenty as\nthere are on that island, there is no fear of starvation, even if we had\nnot the ship's provisions.  I expect a little difficulty with regard to\nwater, for the island is low and small; but we cannot expect to find\neverything exactly as we wish.\"\n\n\"I am thankful to the Almighty for our preservation, Ready; but still\nthere are feelings which I cannot get over.  Here we are cast away upon\na desolate island, which perhaps no ship may ever come near, so that\nthere is little chance of our being taken off.  It is a melancholy and\ncruel fate, Ready, and that you must acknowledge.\"\n\n\"Mr Seagrave, as an old man compared to you, I may venture to say that\nyou are ungrateful to Heaven to give way to these repinings.  What is\nsaid in the book of Job?  `Shall we receive good of the Lord, and shall\nwe not receive evil?'  Besides, who knows whether good may not proceed\nfrom what appears evil?  I beg your pardon, Mr Seagrave, I hope I have\nnot offended you; but, indeed, sir, I felt that it was my duty to speak\nas I have done.\"\n\n\"You have reproved me very justly, Ready; and I thank you for it,\"\nreplied Mr Seagrave; \"I will repine no more, but make the best of it.\"\n\n\"And trust in God, sir, who, if he thinks fit, will restore you once\nmore to your friends, and increase tenfold your flocks and herds.\"\n\n\"That quotation becomes very apt, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave, smiling,\n\"considering that all my prospects are in flocks and herds upon my land\nin New South Wales.  I must put myself under your orders; for, in our\npresent position, you are my superior--knowledge is power.  Can we do\nanything to-night?\"\n\n\"I can do a little, Mr Seagrave; but you cannot assist me till tomorrow\nmorning, except indeed to help me to drag these two spars aft; and then\nI can rig a pair of sheers, and have them all ready for hoisting up\nto-morrow morning to get the boat in.  You see, with so little strength\non board, and no masts, we shall be obliged to contrive.\"\n\nMr Seagrave assisted Ready in getting the two spars aft, and laid on\nthe spot which was required.  \"There now, Mr Seagrave, you may go down\nbelow.  William had better let loose the two dogs, and give them a\nlittle victuals, for we have quite forgot them, poor things.  I shall\nkeep watch to-night, for I have plenty to do, and plenty to think of;\nso, good-night, sir.\"\n\nReady remained on deck, lashing the heads of the spars, and fixing his\ntackles ready for the morrow.  When all was done, he sat down upon one\nof the hen-coops aft, and remained in deep thought.  At last, tired with\nwatching and exertion, the old man fell asleep.  He was awakened at\ndaylight by the dogs, who had been set at liberty, and who, after\nwalking about the ship and finding nobody, had then gone to sleep at the\ncabin door.  At daybreak they had roused up, and going on deck had found\nold Ready asleep on the hen-coop, and were licking his face in their joy\nat having discovered him.  \"Ay,\" said the old man, as he got off the\nhen-coop, \"you'll all three be useful, if I mistake not, by and by.\nDown, Vixen, down--poor creature, you've lost a good master, I'm\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Stop--now let me see,\" said Ready, talking to himself; \"first--but I'll\nget the log board and a bit of chalk, and write them down, for my memory\nis not quite so good as it was.\"\n\nReady placed the logboard on the hen-coop, and then wrote on it with the\nchalk:--\"Three dogs, two goats, and Billy the kid (I think there's five\npigs); fowls (quite enough); three or four pigeons (I'm sure); the cow\n(she has lain down and won't get up again, I'm afraid, so we must kill\nher); and there's the merino ram and sheep belonging to Mr Seagrave--\nplenty of live stock.  Now, what's the first things we must get on shore\nafter we are all landed--a spar and topgallant sail for a tent, a coil\nor two of rope, a mattress or two for Madam and the children, two axes,\nhammer and nails, something to eat--yes, and something to cut it with.\nThere, that will do for the present,\" said old Ready, getting up.  \"Now,\nI'll just light the fire, get the water on, and, while I think of it,\nboil two or three pieces of beef and pork to go on shore with them; and\nthen I'll call up Mr Seagrave, for I reckon it will be a hard day's\nwork.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9.\n\nAs soon as Ready had executed his intentions, and had fed the animals,\nhe went to the cabin and called Mr Seagrave and William.  With their\nassistance the sheers were raised, and secured in their place; the boat\nwas then hooked on, but, as one person was required to bear it clear of\nthe davits and taffrail, they could not hoist it in.\n\n\"Master William, will you run down to Juno, and tell her to come on deck\nto assist us--we must all work now?\"\n\nWilliam soon returned with Juno, who was a strong girl; and, with her\nassistance, they succeeded in getting the boat in.\n\nThe boat was turned over, and Ready commenced his work; while Mr\nSeagrave, at his request, put the pitch-pot on the galley fire, all\nready for pitching the canvas when it was nailed on.  It was not till\ndinner-time that Ready, who had worked hard, could patch up the boat; he\nthen payed the canvas and the seams which he had caulked with pitch both\ninside and out.\n\n\"I think we shall do now, sir,\" said Ready; \"we'll drag her to the\ngangway and launch her.  It's fortunate for us that they did clear away\nthe gunnel, as we shall have no trouble.\"\n\nA rope was made fast to the boat, to hold her to the ship: she was then\nlaunched over the gunnel by the united exertions of Mr Seagrave and\nReady, and to their great satisfaction she appeared to leak very little.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Ready, \"what shall we do first--take some things on\nshore, or some of the children?\"\n\n\"What do you say, Ready?\"\n\n\"I think as the water is as smooth as glass, and we can land anywhere,\nyou and I had better go first to reconnoitre,--it is not two hundred\nyards to the beach, and we shall lose but little time.\"\n\n\"Very well, Ready, I will first run down and tell my wife.\"\n\n\"And, in the meanwhile, I'll put the sail into the boat, and one or two\nother things.\"\n\nReady put the sail in, an axe, a musket, and some cord; then they both\ngot into the boat and pulled on shore.\n\nWhen they landed, they found that they could see nothing of the interior\nof the island, the cocoa-nut groves were so thick; but to their right\nthey perceived, at about a quarter of a mile off, a small sandy cove,\nwith brushwood growing in front of the cocoa-nut trees.\n\n\"That,\" said Ready, pointing to it, \"must be our location.  Let us get\ninto the boat again and pull to it.\"\n\nIn a few minutes they arrived at the cove; the water was shallow, and as\nclear as crystal.  Beneath the boat's bottom they could see beautiful\nshells, and the fish darting about in every direction.\n\nThe sand extended about forty yards from the water, and then commenced\nthe brushwood, which ran back about forty yards further, intermingled\nwith single cocoa-nut trees, until it joined the cocoa-nut grove.  They\npulled the boat in and landed.\n\n\"What a lovely spot this is!\" exclaimed Mr Seagrave; \"and perhaps\nmortal man has never yet visited it till now: those cocoa-nuts have\nborne their fruit year after year, have died, and others have sprung up\nin their stead; and here has this spot remained, perhaps for centuries,\nall ready for man to live in, and to enjoy whenever he should come to\nit.\"\n\n\"Providence is bountiful, Mr Seagrave,\" replied Ready, \"and supplies\nour wants when we least expect it.  If you please we will walk a little\nway into the wood: take the gun as a precaution, sir; not that there\nappears to be much occasion for it--there is seldom anything wild on\nthese small islands, except a pig or two has been put on shore by\nconsiderate Christians.\"\n\n\"Well, now that we are in the grove, Ready, what do you think?\"\n\n\"I was looking for a place to fix a tent up for the present, sir, and I\nthink that on that little rise would be a very good place till we can\nlook about us and do better; but we have no time now, sir, for we have\nplenty of trips to make before nightfall.  If you please, we'll haul the\nsail and other articles on to the beach, and then return on board.\"\n\nAs they were pulling the boat back, Ready said, \"I've been thinking\nabout what is best, Mr Seagrave.  Would Mrs Seagrave mind your leaving\nher?--if not, I should say we should have Juno and William on shore\nfirst, as they can be of use.\"\n\n\"I do not think that she will mind being left on board with William and\nthe children, provided that I return for her when she is to come on\nshore herself with the baby.\"\n\n\"Well then, let William remain on board, if you please, sir.  I'll land\nyou and Juno, Tommy, and the dogs, this time, for they will be a\nprotection in case of accidents.  You and Juno can be doing something\nwhile I return by myself for the other articles we shall require.\"\n\nAs soon as they arrived on board, Mr Seagrave went down to cheer his\nwife with the account of what they had seen.  While he was down below,\nReady had cast off the lashings of the two spars which had formed the\nsheers, and dragging them forward, had launched them over the gunnel,\nwith lines fast to them, ready for towing on shore.  In a few minutes\nJuno and Tommy made their appearance on deck; Ready put some tools into\nthe boat, and a couple of shovels, which he brought up when he went for\nthe dogs, and once more they landed at the sandy cove.  Tommy stared\nabout him a great deal, but did not speak, until he saw the shells lying\non the beach, when he screamed with delight, and began to pick them up\nas fast as he could; the dogs barked and galloped about, overjoyed at\nbeing once more on shore; and Juno smiled as she looked around her,\nsaying to Ready, \"What a nice place!\"\n\n\"Now, Mr Seagrave, I'll remain on shore with you a little.  First,\nwe'll load the musket in case of need, and then you can put it out of\nthe way of Tommy, who fingers everything, I observe.  We will take up\nthe sail between us.  Juno, you can carry the tools; and then we can\ncome back again for the spars, and the rope, and the other things.\nCome, Tommy, you can carry a shovel at all events, and that will make\nyou of some use.\"\n\nHaving taken all these things to the little knoll which Ready had\npointed out before, they returned for the spars; and in two trips they\nhad carried everything there, Tommy with the second shovel on his\nshoulder, and very proud to be employed.\n\n\"Here are two trees which will answer our purpose pretty well,\" said\nReady, \"as they are far enough apart: we must lash the spars up to them,\nand then throw the sail over, and bring it down to the ground at both\nends; that will be a beginning, at all events; and I will bring some\nmore canvas on shore, to set up the other tent between these other\ntrees, and also to shut up the two ends of both of them; then we shall\nhave a shelter for Madam, and Juno, and the younger children, and\nanother for William, Tommy, and ourselves.  Now, sir, I'll just help you\nto lash the spars, and then I'll leave you to finish while I go on board\nagain.\"\n\n\"But how can we reach so high, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, we can manage that by first lashing a spar as high as we can\nconveniently reach, and then standing on that while we lash the other in\nits proper place.  I shall bring another spar on shore, that we may do\nthe same when we set up the other tent.\"\n\nHaving by this plan succeeded in lashing the spar high enough, and\nthrowing the sail over the spar, Ready and Mr Seagrave spread it out,\nand found that it made a very good-sized tent.\n\n\"Now, sir, I'll return on board; in the meantime, if you can cut pegs\nfrom the brush-wood to fasten the sail down to the ground, and then with\nthe shovel cover the bottom of it with sand to keep it down, it will be\nclose enough when it is all finished.\"\n\n\"I shall do very well,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"Juno can help me to pull\nthe canvas out tight when I am ready.\"\n\n\"Yes; and in the meantime, Juno, take a shovel, and level the inside of\nthe tent nice and smooth, and throw out all those old cocoa-nut leaves,\nand look if you see any vermin lurking among them.  Master Tommy, you\nmust not run away; and you must not touch the axes, they will cut you if\nyou do.  It may be as well to say, Mr Seagrave, that should anything\nhappen, and you require my assistance, you had better fire off the gun,\nand I will come on shore to you immediately.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10.\n\nWhen Ready returned on board, he first went down into the cabin to\nacquaint Mrs Seagrave and William with what they had done.  Mrs\nSeagrave naturally felt anxious about her husband being on shore alone,\nand Ready informed her that they had agreed that if anything should\noccur Mr Seagrave would fire the musket.  He then went down into the\nsail-room to get some canvas, a new topgallant sail which was there, and\na palm and needles with twine.  Scarcely had he got them out, and at the\nfoot of the ladder, when the report of the musket was heard, and Mrs\nSeagrave rushed out of the cabin in the greatest alarm; Ready seized\nanother musket, jumped into the boat, and pulled on shore as fast as he\ncould.  On his arrival, quite out of breath, for as he pulled on shore\nhe had his back towards it, and could see nothing, he found Mr Seagrave\nand Juno busy with the tent, and Tommy sitting on the ground crying very\nlustily.  It appeared that, while Mr Seagrave and Juno were employed,\nTommy had crept away to where the musket was placed up on end against a\ncocoa-nut tree, and, after pulling it about some little while, had\ntouched the trigger.  The musket went off; and, as the muzzle was\npointed upwards, the charge had brought down two large cocoa-nuts.  Mr\nSeagrave, who was aware what an alarm this would produce on board the\nvessel, had been scolding him soundly, and now Master Tommy was crying,\nto prove how very penitent he was.\n\n\"I had better return on board immediately, sir, and tell Mrs Seagrave,\"\nsaid Ready.\n\n\"Do, pray,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\nReady then returned to the ship, and explained matters, and then\nrecommenced his labour.\n\nHaving put into the boat the sailmaker's bag, with palm and needles, two\nmattresses, and blankets from the captain's state room, the saucepan\nwith the beef and pork, and a spar which he towed astern, Ready found\nthat he had as much as he could carry; but, as there was nobody but\nhimself in it, he came on shore very well.  Having, with the assistance\nof Mr Seagrave and Juno, got all the things up to the knoll, Ready\nlashed the spar up for the second tent, and then leaving them to fix it\nup like the other, he returned again on board.  He made two other trips\nto the ship, bringing with him more bedding, a bag of ship's biscuits,\nanother of potatoes, plates, knives and forks, spoons, frying-pans and\nother cooking utensils, and a variety of other articles.  He then showed\nJuno how to fill up the ends of the first tent with the canvas and sails\nhe had brought on shore, so as to inclose it all round; Juno took the\nneedle and twine, and worked very well.  Ready, satisfied that she would\nbe able to get on without them, now said: \"Mr Seagrave, we have but two\nhours more daylight, and it is right that Mrs Seagrave should come on\nshore now; so, if you please, we'll go off and fetch her and the\nchildren.  I think we shall be able to do very well for the first night;\nand if it pleases God to give us fine weather, we may do a great deal\nmore to-morrow.\"\n\nAs soon as they arrived on board, Mr Seagrave went down to his wife to\npropose her going on shore.  She was much agitated, and very weak from\nher illness, but she behaved courageously notwithstanding, and,\nsupported by her husband, gained the deck, William following with the\nbaby, and his little sister Caroline carried by Ready.  With some\ndifficulty they were all at last placed in the boat and shoved off; but\nMrs Seagrave was so ill, that her husband was obliged to support her in\nhis arms, and William took an oar.  They landed very safely, and carried\nMrs Seagrave up to the tent, and laid her down on one of the\nmattresses.  She asked for a little water.\n\n\"And I have forgotten to bring any with me: well, I am a stupid old man;\nbut I'll go on board directly,\" said Ready: \"to think that I should be\nso busy in bringing other things on shore and forget the greatest\nnecessary in life!  The fact is, I intended to look for it on the island\nas soon as I could, as it would save a great deal of trouble.\"\n\nReady returned on board as fast as he could, and brought on shore two\nkegs of fresh water, which he and William rolled up to the tent.\n\nJuno had completely finished her task, and Mrs Seagrave having drunk\nsome water, declared that she was much better.\n\n\"I shall not return on board any more to-night,\" said Ready, \"I feel\ntired--very tired indeed.\"\n\n\"You must be,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"do not think of doing any more.\"\n\n\"And I haven't touched food this day, or even quenched my thirst,\"\nreplied Ready, sitting down.\n\n\"You are ill, are you not, Ready?\" said William.\n\n\"A little faint, William; I'm not so young as I was.  Could you give me\na little water?\"\n\n\"Stop, William, I will,\" said Mr Seagrave, taking up a tin can which\nhad been filled for his wife: \"here, Ready, drink this.\"\n\n\"I shall be better soon, sir; I'll just lie down a little, and then I'll\nhave a biscuit and a little meat.\"\n\nPoor old Ready was indeed quite tired out; but he ate something, and\nfelt much revived.  Juno was very busy; she had given the children some\nof the salt meat and biscuit to eat.  The baby, and Tommy, and Caroline\nhad been put to bed, and the second tent was nearly ready.\n\n\"It will do very well for to-night, Juno,\" said Mr Seagrave; \"we have\ndone work enough for this day.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Ready, \"and I think we ought to thank God for his\nmercies to us before we go to sleep.\"\n\n\"You remind me of my duty, Ready; let us thank him for his goodness, and\npray to him for his protection before we go to sleep.\"\n\nMr Seagrave then offered up a prayer of thankfulness; and they all\nretired to rest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11.\n\nMr Seagrave was the first who awoke and rose from his bed on the\nensuing morning.  He stepped out of the tent, and looked around him.\nThe sky was clear and brilliant.  A light breeze ruffled o'er the\nsurface of the water, and the tiny waves rippled one after another upon\nthe white sand of the cove.  To the left of the cove the land rose,\nforming small hills, behind which appeared the continuation of the\ncocoa-nut groves.  To the right, a low ridge of coral rocks rose almost\nas a wall from the sea, and joined the herbage and brushwood at about a\nhundred paces, while the wreck of the Pacific, lying like some huge\nstranded monster, formed the prominent feature in the landscape.  The\nsun was powerful where its beams could penetrate; but where Mr Seagrave\nstood, the cocoa-nuts waved their feathery leaves to the wind, and\noffered an impervious shade.  A feeling of the extreme beauty of the\nscene, subdued by the melancholy created by the sight of the wrecked\nvessel, pervaded the mind of Mr Seagrave as he meditated over it.\n\n\"Yes,\" thought he, \"if, tired with the world and its anxieties, I had\nsought an abode of peace and beauty, it would have been on a spot like\nthis.  How lovely is the scene!--what calm--what content--what a sweet\nsadness does it create!  How mercifully have we been preserved when all\nhope appeared to be gone; and how bountifully have we been provided for,\nnow that we have been saved,--and yet I have dared to repine, when I\nought to be full of gratitude!  May God forgive me!  Wife, children, all\nsafe, nothing to regret but a few worldly goods and a seclusion from the\nworld for a time--yes, but for how long a time--What! rebellious\nstill!--for the time that it shall please God in his wisdom to ordain.\"\nMr Seagrave turned back to his tent.  William, Tommy, and old Ready\nstill remained fast asleep.  \"Excellent old man!\" thought Mr Seagrave.\n\"What a heart of oak is hid under that rugged bark!--Had it not been for\nhis devotion where might I and all those dear helpless creatures have\nbeen now?\"\n\nThe dogs, who had crept into the tent and laid themselves down upon the\nmattresses by the side of William and Tommy, now fawned upon Mr\nSeagrave.  William woke up with their whining, and having received a\ncaution from his father not to wake Ready, he dressed himself and came\nout.\n\n\"Had I not better call Juno, father?\" said William; \"I think I can,\nwithout waking mamma, if she is asleep.\"\n\n\"Then do, if you can, my boy; and I will see what cooking utensils Ready\nhas brought on shore.\"\n\nWilliam soon returned to his father, stating that his mother was in a\nsound sleep, and that Juno had got up without waking her or the two\nchildren.\n\n\"Well, we'll see if we cannot get some breakfast ready for them,\nWilliam.  Those dry cocoa-nut leaves will make an excellent fire.\"\n\n\"But, father, how are we to light the fire? we have no tinder-box or\nmatches.\"\n\n\"No; but there are other ways, William, although, in most of them,\ntinder is necessary.  The savages can produce fire by rubbing a soft\npiece of wood against a hard one.  But we have gunpowder; and we have\ntwo ways of igniting gunpowder--one is by a flint and steel, and the\nother is by collecting the sun's rays into one focus by a\nmagnifying-glass.\"\n\n\"But, father, when we have lighted the fire, what have we to cook? we\nhave no tea or coffee.\"\n\n\"No, I do not think we have,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"But we have potatoes, father.\"\n\n\"Yes, William, but don't you think it would be better if we made our\nbreakfast off the cold beef and pork and ship's biscuit for once, and\nnot use the potatoes? we may want them all to plant, you know.  But why\nshould we not go on board of the ship ourselves? you can pull an oar\npretty well, and we must all learn to work now, and not leave everything\nfor poor old Ready to do.  Come, William.\"\n\nMr Seagrave then went down to the cove; the little boat was lying on\nthe beach, just lifted by the rippling waves; they pushed her off, and\ngot into her.  \"I know where the steward kept the tea and coffee,\nfather,\" said William, as they pulled on board; \"mamma would like some\nfor breakfast, I'm sure, and I'll milk the goats for baby.\"\n\nAlthough they were neither of them very handy at the oar, they were soon\nalongside of the ship; and, having made the boat fast, they climbed on\nboard.\n\nWilliam first went down to the cabin for the tea and coffee, and then\nleft his father to collect other things while he went to milk the goats,\nwhich he did in a tin pan.  He then poured the milk into a bottle, which\nhe had washed out, that it might not be spilt, and went back to his\nfather.\n\n\"I have filled these two baskets full of a great many things, William,\nwhich will be very acceptable to your mamma.  What else shall we take?\"\n\n\"Let us take the telescope, at all events, father; and let us take a\nwhole quantity of clothes--they will please mamma: the clean ones are\nall in the drawers--we can bring them up in a sheet; and then, father,\nlet us bring some of the books on shore; and I'm sure mamma will long\nfor her Bible and prayer-book;--here they are.\"\n\n\"You are a good boy, William,\" replied Mr Seagrave.  \"I will now take\nthose things up to the boat, and then return for the rest.\"\n\nIn a short time everything was put into the boat, and they pulled on\nshore again.  They found Juno, who had been washing herself, waiting for\nthem at the cove, to assist to take up the things.\n\n\"Well, Juno, how do you find yourself this morning?\"\n\n\"Quite well, massa,\" said Juno: and then pointing to the clear water,\nshe said, \"Plenty fish here.\"\n\n\"Yes, if we only had lines,\" replied Mr Seagrave.  \"I think Ready has\nboth hooks and lines somewhere.  Come, Juno, take up this bundle of\nlinen to your tent: we can manage all the rest.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at the tent they found that every one was awake except\nReady, who appeared still to sleep very sound.  Mrs Seagrave had passed\na very good night, and felt herself much refreshed.  William made some\ntouch-paper, which he lighted with one of the glasses from the\ntelescope, and they soon had a good fire.  Mr Seagrave went to the\nbeach, and procured three large stones to rest the saucepan on; and in\nhalf an hour the water was boiling and the tea made.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12.\n\nJuno had taken the children down to the cove, and, walking out into the\nwater up to her knees, had dipped them in all over, as the shortest way\nof washing them, and had then dressed them and left them with their\nmother, while she assisted William to get the cups and saucers and\nplates for breakfast.  Everything was laid out nice and tidy between the\ntwo tents, and then William proposed that he should awaken Ready.\n\n\"Yes, my boy, you may as well now--he will want his breakfast.\"\n\nWilliam went and pushed Ready on the shoulder.  \"Ready, have you had\nsleep enough?\" said William, as the old man sat up.\n\n\"Yes, William.  I have had a good nap, I expect; and now I will get up,\nand see what I can get for breakfast for you all.\"\n\n\"Do,\" replied William, laughing.\n\nReady was soon dressed, for he had only taken off his jacket when he lay\ndown.  He put it on, and came out of the tent; when, to his\nastonishment, he found the whole party (Mrs Seagrave having come out\nwith the children) standing round the breakfast, which was spread on the\nground.\n\n\"Good-morning, Ready!\" said Mrs Seagrave, extending her hand.  Mr\nSeagrave also shook hands with him.\n\n\"You have had a good long sleep, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"and I would\nnot waken you after your fatigue of yesterday.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir; and I am glad to see that Madam is so well: and I am\nnot sorry to see that you can do so well without me,\" continued Ready,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Indeed, but we cannot, I'm afraid,\" replied Mrs Seagrave; \"had it not\nbeen for you and your kindness, where should we have been now?\"\n\n\"We can get a breakfast ready without you,\" said Mr Seagrave; \"but\nwithout you, I think we never should have required another breakfast by\nthis time.  But we will tell Ready all we have done while we eat our\nbreakfast: now, my dear, if you please.\"  Mrs Seagrave then read a\nchapter from the Bible, and afterwards they all knelt down while Mr\nSeagrave offered up a prayer.\n\nWhile they were at breakfast, William told Ready how they had gone on\nboard, and what they had brought on shore, and he also mentioned how\nJuno had dipped all the children in the sea.\n\n\"But Juno must not do that again,\" replied Ready, \"until I have made all\nsafe; you know that there are plenty of sharks about these islands, and\nit is very dangerous to go into the water.\"\n\n\"Oh, what an escape they have had!\" cried Mrs Seagrave, shuddering.\n\n\"It's very true,\" continued Ready; \"but they don't keep so much to the\nwindward of the islands where we are at present; but still that smooth\ncove is a very likely place for them to come into; so it's just as well\nnot to go in again, Juno, until I have time to make a place for you to\nbathe in in safety.  As soon as we can get as much as we want from the\nship, we must decide whether we shall stay here or not.\"\n\n\"Stay here or not, Ready!--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, we have not yet found any water, and that is the first necessary\nof life--if there is no water on this side of the island, we must pitch\nour tents somewhere else.\"\n\n\"That's very true,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"I wish we could find time to\nexplore a little.\"\n\n\"So we can, sir; but we must not lose this fine weather to get a few\nthings from the ship.  We had better go now.  You and William can remain\non board to collect the things, and I will land them on the beach for\nJuno to bring up.\"\n\nThe whole day was spent in landing every variety of article which they\nthought could be useful.  All the small sails, cordage, twine, canvas,\nsmall casks, saws, chisels, and large nails, and elm and oak plank, were\nbrought on shore before dinner.  After they had taken a hearty dinner,\nthe cabin tables and chairs, all their clothes, some boxes of candles,\ntwo bags of coffee, two of rice, two more of biscuits, several pieces of\nbeef and pork and bags of flour, some more water, the grindstone, and\nMrs Seagrave's medicine-chest were landed.  When Ready came off again,\nhe said, \"Our poor boat is getting very leaky, and will not take much\nmore on shore without being repaired; and Juno has not been able to get\nhalf the things up--they are too heavy for one person.  I think we shall\ndo pretty well now, Mr Seagrave; and we had better, before it is dark,\nget all the animals on shore.  I don't much like to trust them to swim\non shore, but they are awkward things in a boat.  We'll try a pig, at\nall events; and while I get one up, do you and William tie the legs of\nthe fowls, and put them into the boat; as for the cow, she cannot be\nbrought on shore, she is still lying down, and, I expect, won't get up\nagain any more; however, I have given her plenty of hay, and if she\ndon't rise, why I will kill her, and we can salt her down.\"\n\nReady went below, and the squealing of the pig was soon heard; he came\non deck with it hanging over his back by the hind legs, and threw it\ninto the sea over the gunnel: the pig floundered at first; but after a\nfew seconds, turned its head away from the ship and swam for the shore.\n\n\"He goes ashore straight enough,\" said Ready, who, with Mr Seagrave and\nWilliam, was watching the animal; but a minute afterwards, Ready\nexclaimed:\n\n\"I thought as much--we've lost him!\"\n\n\"How?\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"D'ye see that black thing above water pushing so fast to the animal?--\nthat's the back fin of a shark, and he will have the poor thing--there,\nhe's got him!\" said Ready, as the pig disappeared under the water with a\nheavy splash.  \"Well, he's gone; better the pig than your little\nchildren, Mr Seagrave.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, God be praised!--that monster might have been close to\nthem at the time that Juno took them into the water.\"\n\n\"He was not far off; I reckon,\" replied Ready.  \"We'll go down now and\ntie the legs of the other four pigs, and bring them up; with what's\nalready in the boat they will be a good load.\"\n\nAs soon as the pigs were in the boat, Ready sculled it on shore, while\nMr Seagrave and William brought up the goats and sheep ready for the\nnext trip.  Ready soon returned.  \"Now this will be our last trip for\nto-day, and, if I am any judge of the weather, our last trip for some\ndays; it is banking up very thick in the offing.  This trip we'll be\nable to put into the boat a bag of corn for the creatures, in case we\nrequire it, and then we may say good-bye to the ship for a day or two at\nleast.\"\n\nThey then all got into the boat, which was very deeply laden, for the\ncorn was heavy, but they got safe on shore, although they leaked very\nmuch.  Having landed the goats and sheep, William led them up to the\ntent, where they remained very quietly; the pigs had run away, and so\nhad the fowls.\n\n\"That's what I call a good day's work, Mr Seagrave,\" said Ready; \"the\nlittle boat has done its duty well; but we must not venture in her again\nuntil I have put her into a little better condition.\"\n\nThey were not at all sorry, after their hard day's work, to find that\nJuno had prepared coffee for them; and while they were drinking it, they\nnarrated to Mrs Seagrave the tragically death of the poor pig by the\nshark.  Poor Juno appeared quite frightened at the danger which the\nchildren had been in, even now that it was all over.\n\n\"We shall have plenty to do here to-morrow,\" observed Mr Seagrave, \"in\ngetting things into their places.\"\n\n\"We shall have plenty to do for some time, I expect,\" replied Ready.\n\"In two months, or thereabouts, we shall have the rainy season come on,\nand we must be under cover before that time, if we possibly can.\"\n\n\"What's the first thing we must do, Ready?\" inquired Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"To-morrow we had better fix up another tent or two, to stow away all\nthe articles we have brought on shore: that will be one good day's work;\nwe shall then know where to lay our hands upon everything, and see what\nwe want.\"\n\n\"That's very true; and what shall we do then?\"\n\n\"Why then, sir, I think we must make a little expedition to explore the\nisland, and find out where we must build our house.\"\n\n\"Can we build a house?\" said William.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir, and with more ease than you would think.  There's no tree\nso valuable as the cocoa-nut tree; and the wood is so light that we can\neasily move it about.\"\n\n\"Why, what are the great merits of the cocoa-nut tree?\" said Mrs\nSeagrave.\n\n\"I'll tell you, madam: in the first place, you have the wood to build\nthe house with; then you have the bark with which you can make ropes and\nlines, and fishing-nets if you please; then you have the leaves for\nthatching your house; then you have the fruit, which, as a nut, is good\nto eat, and very useful in cooking; and in the young nut is the milk,\nwhich is also very wholesome; then you have the oil to burn, and the\nshell to make cups of, if you haven't any, and then you can draw toddy\nfrom the tree, which is very pleasant to drink when fresh, but will make\nyou tipsy if it is kept too long.  There is no tree which yields so many\nuseful things to man, for it supplies him with almost everything.\"\n\n\"At all events, we've plenty of them,\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, William, there's no want of them; and I am glad of it, for had\nthere been but few, I should not have liked to destroy them.  People\nmight be wrecked here, as well as ourselves, and without the good\nfortune that we have had in getting so many necessaries on shore; and\nthey might be obliged to depend wholly upon the cocoa-nut trees for\ntheir support.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13.\n\nWhen breakfast was over the next morning, Ready observed, \"Now, Mr\nSeagrave, we must hold a council of war, and decide upon an exploring\nparty for to-morrow; and, when we have settled that, we will find some\nuseful way of employing ourselves for the rest of the day.  The first\nquestion is, of whom is the party to consist?--and upon that I wish to\nhear your opinion.\"\n\n\"Why, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"it appears to me that you and I\nshould go.\"\n\n\"Surely not both of you, my dear,\" interrupted Mrs Seagrave.  \"You can\ndo without my husband, can you not, Ready?\"\n\n\"I certainly should have liked to have Mr Seagrave to advise with,\nma'am,\" replied Ready; \"but still I have thought upon it, and do not\nthink that William would be quite sufficient protection for you; or, at\nall events, you would not feel that he was, which is much the same\nthing; and so, if Mr Seagrave has no objection, it would perhaps be\nbetter that he remained with you.\"\n\n\"Would you go alone, then, Ready?\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"No, sir, I do not think that would be right either,--some accident\nmight happen; there is no saying what might happen, although there is\nevery appearance of safety.  I should like, therefore, to have some one\nwith me; the question is, whether it be William or Juno?\"\n\n\"Take me,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"Take you, Tommy!\" said Ready, laughing; \"then I must take Juno to take\ncare of you.  No; I think they cannot spare you.  Your mamma will want\nyou when we are gone; you are so useful in gathering wood for the fire,\nand taking care of your little sister and brother, that your mother\ncannot part with you; so I must have either Juno or William.\"\n\n\"And which would you prefer, Ready?\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"William, certainly, ma'am, if you will let him go with me, as you could\nill spare the girl.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I do not like it; I would rather lose Juno for a time,\" replied\nMrs Seagrave.\n\n\"My dear wife,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"recollect how Providence has\npreserved us in such awful dangers--how we are landed in safety.  And\nnow, will you not put trust in that Providence, when the dangers are, as\nI trust, only imaginary?\"\n\n\"I was wrong, my dear husband; but sickness and suffering have made me,\nI fear, not only nervous and frightened, but selfish: I must and will\nshake it off.  Hitherto I have only been a clog and an incumbrance to\nyou; but I trust I shall soon behave better, and make myself useful.  If\nyou think, then, that it would be better that you should go instead of\nWilliam, I am quite content.  Go, then, with Ready, and may Heaven\nprotect you both!\"\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" replied Ready, \"William will do just as well.  Indeed, I\nwould go by myself with pleasure; but we know not what the day may bring\nforth.  I might be taken ill--I might hurt myself--I am an old man, you\nknow; and then I was thinking that if any accident was to happen to me,\nyou might miss me--that's all.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Mrs Seagrave; \"a mother is foolish at times.\"\n\n\"Over-anxious, ma'am, perhaps, but not foolish,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"Well, then, William shall go with you, Ready;--that point's settled,\"\nobserved Mr Seagrave: \"what is the next?\"\n\n\"The next is to prepare for our journey.  We must take some provisions\nand water with us, a gun and some ammunition, a large axe for me, and\none of the hatchets for William; and, if you please, Romulus and Remus\nhad better come with us.  Juno, put a piece of beef and a piece of pork\ninto the pot.  William, will you fill four quart bottles with water,\nwhile I sew up a knapsack out of canvas for each of us?\"\n\n\"And what shall I do, Ready?\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Why, sir, if you will sharpen the axe and the hatchet on the\ngrindstone, it would be of great service, and Tommy can turn it, he is\nso fond of work.\"\n\nTommy jumped up directly; he was quite strong enough to turn the\ngrindstone, but he was much fonder of play than work; but as Ready had\nsaid that he was fond of it, he wished to prove that such was the case,\nand worked very hard.  Before they went to prayers and retired for the\nnight, the axe was sharpened, the knapsacks made, and everything else\nready.\n\n\"When do you intend to start, Ready?\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Why, sir, I should like to get off at the dawn of day, when the heat is\nnot so great.\"\n\n\"And when do you intend to come back?\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Why, madam, we have provisions enough for three days: if we start\nto-morrow morning, which is Wednesday, I hope to be back some time on\nFriday evening; but I won't be later than Saturday morning if I can help\nit.\"\n\n\"Good-night--and good-bye, mother,\" said William, \"for I shall not see\nyou to-morrow!\"\n\n\"God bless and protect you, my dear child!\" replied Mrs Seagrave.\n\"Take care of him, Ready, and good-bye to you till we meet.\"\n\nMrs Seagrave went into the tent to hide the tears which she could not\nsuppress.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14.\n\nReady was up before the sun had appeared, and he awakened William.  The\nknapsacks had been already packed, with two bottles of water in each,\nwrapped round with cocoa-nut leaves, to prevent their breaking, and the\nbeef and pork divided between each knapsack.  Ready's, which was larger\nthan William's, held the biscuit and several other things which Ready\nhad prepared in case they might require them.\n\nAs soon as the knapsacks were on, Ready took the axe and gun, and asked\nWilliam if he thought he could carry a small spade on his shoulder,\nwhich they had brought on shore along with the shovels.  William replied\nthat he could; and the dogs, who appeared to know they were going, were\nall ready standing by them.  Then, just as the sun rose, they turned\ninto the cocoa-nut grove, and were soon out of sight of the tents.\n\n\"Now, William, do you know,\" said Ready, stopping after they had walked\ntwenty yards, \"by what means we may find our way back again; for you see\nthis forest of trees is rather puzzling, and there is no path to guide\nus?\"\n\n\"No, I am sure I cannot tell; I was thinking of the very same thing when\nyou spoke; and of Tom Thumb, who strewed peas to find his way back, but\ncould not do it, because the birds picked them all up.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom Thumb did not manage well, and we must try to do better; we\nmust do as the Americans always do in their woods,--we must _blaze_ the\ntrees.\"\n\n\"Blaze them! what, set fire to them?\" replied William.\n\n\"No, no, William.  Blaze is a term they use when they cut a slice of the\nbark off the trunk of a tree, just with one blow of a sharp axe, as a\nmark to find their way back again.  They do not _blaze_ every tree, but\nabout every tenth tree as they go along, first one to the right, and\nthen one to the left, which is quite sufficient; and it is very little\ntrouble,--they do it as they walk along, without stopping.  So now we'll\nbegin: you take the other side, it will be more handy for you to have\nyour hatchet in your right hand; I can use my left.  See now--just a\nslice off the bark--the weight of the axe does it almost.\"\n\n\"What an excellent plan!\" observed William.\n\n\"But I have another friend in my pocket,\" replied Ready, \"and I must use\nhim soon.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Poor Captain Osborn's pocket-compass.  You see, William, the _blazing_\nwill direct us how to go back again; but it will not tell us what course\nwe are now to steer.  At present, I know we are going right, as I can\nsee through the wood behind us; but by and by we shall not be able, and\nthen I must make use of the compass.\"\n\n\"I understand that very well; but tell me, Ready, why do you bring the\nspade with us--what will be the use of it?  You did not say yesterday\nthat you were going to bring me.\"\n\n\"No, William, I did not, as I did not like to make your mother anxious;\nbut the fact is, I am very anxious myself as to whether there is any\nwater on this island; if there is not, we shall have to quit it sooner\nor later, for although we may get water by digging in the sand, it would\nbe too brackish to use for any time, and would make us all ill.  Very\noften there will be water if you dig for it, although it does not show\nabove-ground; and therefore I brought the spade.\"\n\n\"You think of everything, Ready.\"\n\n\"No, I do not, William; but, in our present situation, I think of more\nthings than perhaps your father and mother would: they have never known\nwhat it is to be put to their shifts; but a man like me, who has been\nall his life at sea, and who has been wrecked, and suffered hardships\nand difficulties, and has been obliged to think or die, has a greater\nknowledge, not only from his own sufferings, but by hearing how others\nhave acted when they were in distress.  Necessity sharpens a man's wits;\nand it is very curious what people do contrive when they are compelled\nto do so, especially seamen.\"\n\n\"And where are we going to now, Ready?\"\n\n\"Right to the leeward side of the island.\"\n\n\"Why do you call it the leeward side of the island?\"\n\n\"Because among these islands the winds almost always blow one way; we\nlanded on the windward side; the wind is at our back; now put up your\nfinger, and you will feel it even among the trees.\"\n\n\"No, I cannot,\" replied William, as he held up his finger.\n\n\"Then wet your finger, and try again.\"\n\nWilliam wet his finger, and held it up again.  \"Yes, I feel it now,\"\nsaid he; \"but why is that?\"\n\n\"Because the wind blows against the wet, and you feel the cold.\"\n\nAs Ready said this the dogs growled, then started forward and barked.\n\n\"What can be there?\" cried William.\n\n\"Stand still, William,\" replied Ready, cocking his gun, \"and I will go\nforward to see.\"  Ready advanced cautiously with the gun to his hip.\nThe dogs barked more furiously; and at last, out of a heap of cocoa-nut\nleaves collected together, burst all the pigs which had been brought on\nshore, grunting and galloping away as fast as they could, with the dogs\nin pursuit of them.\n\n\"It's only the pigs,\" said Ready, smiling; \"I never thought I should be\nhalf-frightened by a tame pig.  Here, Romulus! here, Remus! come back!\"\ncontinued Ready, calling to the dogs.  \"Well, William, this is our first\nadventure.\"\n\n\"I hope we shall not meet with any one more dangerous,\" replied William,\nlaughing; \"but I must say that I was alarmed.\"\n\n\"No wonder; for, although not likely, it is possible there may be wild\nanimals on this island, or even savages; but being alarmed is one thing,\nand being afraid is another: a man may be alarmed, and stand his ground;\nbut a man that is afraid will run away.\"\n\n\"I do not think I shall ever run away and leave you, Ready, if there is\ndanger.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will not; but still you must not be rash; and now we will\ngo on again, as soon as I have uncocked my gun.  I have seen more\naccidents happen from people cocking their guns, and forgetting to\nuncock them afterwards, than you can have any idea of.  Recollect, also,\nuntil you want to fire, never cock your gun.\"\n\nReady and William continued their way through the cocoa-nut grove for\nmore than an hour longer, marking the trees as they went along; they\nthen sat down to take their breakfast.\n\n\"Don't give the dogs any water, William, nor any of the salt meat; give\nthem biscuit only.\"\n\n\"But they are very thirsty; may not I give them a little?\"\n\n\"No: we shall want it all ourselves, in the first place; and, in the\nnext, I wish them to be thirsty.  And, William, take my advice, and only\ndrink a small quantity of water at a time.  The more you drink, the more\nyou want.\"\n\n\"Then I should not eat so much salt meat.\"\n\n\"Very true; the less you eat the better, unless we find water, and fill\nour bottles again.\"\n\n\"But we have our axes, and can always cut down a cocoa-nut, and get the\nmilk from the young nuts.\"\n\n\"Very true; and fortunate it is that we have that to resort to; but\nstill we could not do very well on cocoa-nut milk alone, even if it were\nto be procured all the year round.  Now we will go on if you do not feel\ntired.\"\n\n\"Not in the least; I am tired of seeing nothing but the stems of\ncocoa-nut trees, and shall be glad when we are through the wood.\"\n\n\"Then the faster we walk the better,\" said Ready; \"as far as I can\njudge, we must be about half-way across now.\"\n\nReady and William recommenced their journey; and, after half-an-hour's\nwalking, they found that the ground was not so level as it had been--\nsometimes they went gradually up hill, at others down.\n\n\"I am very glad to find the island is not so flat here; we have a better\nchance of finding water.\"\n\n\"It is much steeper before us,\" replied William; \"it's quite a hill.\"\n\nThe ground now became more undulating, although still covered with\ncocoa-nut trees, even thicker together than before.  They continued\ntheir march, occasionally looking at the compass, until William showed\nsymptoms of weariness, for the wood had become more difficult to get\nthrough than at first.\n\n\"How many miles do you think we have walked, Ready?\" said Willy.\n\n\"About eight, I should think.\"\n\n\"Not more than eight?\"\n\n\"No; I do not think that we have made more than two miles an hour: it's\nslow work, travelling by compass and marking the trees; but I think the\nwood looks lighter before us, now that we are at the top of this hill.\"\n\n\"It does, Ready; I fancy I can see the blue sky again.\"\n\n\"Your eyes are younger than mine, William, and perhaps you may--however,\nwe shall soon find out.\"\n\nThey now descended into a small hollow, and then went up hill again.  As\nsoon as they arrived at the top, William cried out, \"The sea, Ready!\nthere's the sea!\"\n\n\"Very true, William, and I'm not sorry for it.\"\n\n\"I thought we never should get out of that nasty wood again,\" said\nWilliam, as he impatiently pushed on, and at last stood clear of the\ncocoa-nut grove.  Ready soon joined him, and they surveyed the scene\nbefore them in silence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15.\n\n\"Oh! how beautiful!\" exclaimed William, at last; \"I'm sure mamma would\nlike to live here.  I thought the other side of the island very pretty,\nbut it's nothing compared to this.\"\n\n\"It is very beautiful,\" replied Ready, thoughtfully.\n\nA more lovely scene could scarcely be imagined.  The cocoa-nut grove\nterminated about a quarter of a mile from the beach, very abruptly, for\nthere was a rapid descent for about thirty feet from where they stood to\nthe land below, on which was a mixture of little grass knolls and\nbrushwood, to about fifty yards from the water's edge, where it was met\nwith dazzling white sand, occasionally divided by narrow ridges of rock\nwhich ran inland.  The water was a deep blue, except where it was broken\ninto white foam on the reefs, which extended for miles from the beach,\nand the rocks of which now and then showed themselves above water.  On\nthe rocks were perched crowds of gannets and men-of-war birds, while\nothers wheeled in the air, every now and then darting down into the blue\nsea, and bringing up in their bills a fish out of the shoals which\nrippled the water, or bounded clear of it in their gambols.  The form of\nthe coast was that of a horse-shoe bay--two points of land covered with\nshrubs extending far out on each side.  The line of the horizon, far out\nat sea, was clear and unbroken.\n\nReady remained for some time without speaking; he scanned the horizon\nright and left, and then he turned his eyes along the land.  At last\nWilliam said:\n\n\"What are you thinking of, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, I am thinking that we must look for water as fast as we can.\"\n\n\"But why are you so anxious?\"\n\n\"Because I can see no island to leeward of us as I expected, and\ntherefore there is less chance of getting off this island; and this bay,\nalthough very beautiful, is full of reefs, and I see no inlet, which\nmakes it awkward for many reasons.  But we cannot judge at first sight.\nLet us now sit down and take our dinner, and after that we will explore\na little.\"\n\nReady cut two wide marks in the stems of the cocoa-nut trees, and then\ndescended with William to the low ground, where they sat down to eat\ntheir dinner.  As soon as their meal was finished they first walked down\nto the water's edge, and Ready turned his eyes inland to see if he could\ndiscover any little ravine or hollow which might be likely to contain\nfresh water.  \"There are one or two places there,\" observed Ready,\npointing to them with his finger, \"where the water has run down in the\nrainy season: we must examine them carefully, but not now.  I want to\nfind out whether there is any means of getting our little boat through\nthis reef of rocks, or otherwise we shall have very hard work (if we\nchange our abode to this spot) to bring all our stores through that\nwood; so we will pass the rest of this day in examining the coast, and\nto-morrow we will try for fresh water.\"\n\n\"Look at the dogs, Ready, they are drinking the sea-water, poor things!\"\n\n\"They won't drink much of that, I expect; you see they don't like it\nalready.\"\n\n\"How beautiful the corals are--look here, they grow like little trees\nunder the water,--and look here, here is really a flower in bloom\ngrowing on that rock just below the water.\"\n\n\"Put your finger to it, Master William,\" said Ready.\n\nWilliam did so, and the flower, as he called it, immediately shut up.\n\n\"Why, it's flesh, and alive!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is; I have often seen them before: they call them\nsea-anemones--they are animals; but I don't know whether they are\nshell-fish or not.  Now, let us walk out to the end of this point of\nland, and see if we can discover any opening in the reef.  The sun is\ngoing down, and we shall not have more than an hour's daylight, and then\nwe must look out for a place to sleep in.\"\n\n\"But what is that?\" cried William, pointing to the sand--\"that round\ndark thing?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm very glad to see, William: it's a turtle.  They come up\nabout this time in the evening to drop their eggs, and then they bury\nthem in the sand.\"\n\n\"Can't we catch them?\"\n\n\"Yes, we can catch them if we go about it quietly; but you must take\ncare not to go behind them, or they will throw such a shower of sand\nupon you, with their hind flappers or fins, that they would blind you\nand escape at the same time.  The way to catch them is to get at their\nheads and turn them over on their backs by one of the fore-fins, and\nthen they cannot turn back again.\"\n\n\"Let us go and catch that one.\"\n\n\"I should think it very foolish to do so, as we could not take it away,\nand it would die to-morrow from the heat of the sun.\"\n\n\"I did not think of that, Ready; if we come to live here, I suppose we\nshall catch them whenever we want them.\"\n\n\"No, we shall not, for they only come on shore in the breeding-season;\nbut we will make a turtle pond somewhere which they cannot get out of,\nbut which the sea flows into; and then when we catch them we will put\nthem into it, and have them ready for use as we require them.\"\n\n\"That will be a very good plan,\" replied William.\n\nThey now continued their walk, and, forcing their way through the\nbrushwood which grew thick upon the point of land, soon arrived at the\nend of it.\n\n\"What is that out there?\" said William, pointing to the right of where\nthey stood.\n\n\"That is another island, which I am very glad to see even in that\ndirection, although it will not be so easy to gain it, if we are obliged\nto leave this for want of water.  It is a much larger island than this,\nat all events,\" continued Ready, scanning the length of the horizon,\nalong which he could see the tops of the trees.--\"Well, we have done\nvery well for our first day, so we will go and look for a place to lie\ndown and pass the night.\"\n\nThey returned to the high ground where the cocoa-nut grove ended, and\ncollecting together several branches and piles of leaves, made a good\nsoft bed under the trees.\n\n\"And now we'll go to bed.  Look, William, at the long shadow of the\ntrees the sun has nearly set.\"\n\n\"Shall I give the dogs some water now, Ready?  See, poor Remus is\nlicking the sides of the bottles.\"\n\n\"No, do not give them any: it appears to be cruel, but I want the\nintelligence of the poor animals to-morrow, and the want of water will\nmake them very keen, and we shall turn it to good account.  So now,\nWilliam, we must not forget to return thanks to a merciful God, and to\nbeg his care over us for this night.  We little know what the day may\nbring forth.  Good-night!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16.\n\nWilliam slept as sound as if he had been on shore in England upon a soft\nbed in a warm room--so did old Ready; and when they awoke the next\nmorning it was broad daylight.  The poor dogs were suffering for want of\nwater, and it pained William to see them with their tongues out, panting\nand whining as they looked up to him.  \"Now, William,\" said Ready,\n\"shall we take our breakfast before we start, or have a walk first?\"\n\n\"Ready, I cannot really drink a drop of water myself, and I am thirsty,\nunless you give a little to these poor dogs.\"\n\n\"I pity the poor dumb creatures as much as you do, Master Willy; it is\nkindness to ourselves and them too, which makes me refuse it to them.\nHowever, if you like, we will take a walk first, and see if we can find\nany water.  Let us first go to the little dell to the right, and if we\ndo not succeed, we will try farther on where the water has run down\nduring the rainy season.\"  William was very glad to go, and away they\nwent, followed by the dogs, Ready having taken up the spade, which he\ncarried on his shoulder.  They soon came to the dell, and the dogs put\ntheir noses to the ground, and snuffed about.  Ready watched them; at\nlast they lay down panting.\n\n\"Let us go on,\" said Ready, thoughtfully; they went on to where the run\nof water appeared to have been--the dogs snuffed about more eagerly than\nbefore.\n\n\"You see, William, these poor dogs are now so eager for water, that if\nthere is any, they will find it out where we never could.  I don't\nexpect water above-ground, but there may be some below it.  This beach\nis hardly far enough from the water's edge, or I should try in the sand\nfor it.\"\n\n\"In the sand--but would it not be salt?\" replied William.\n\n\"No, not if at a good distance from the sea-beach; for you see, William,\nthe sand by degrees filters the sea-water fresh, and very often when the\nsand runs in a long way from the high-water mark, if you dig down, you\nwill find good fresh water, at other times it is a little brackish, but\nstill fit for use.\"\n\n\"Look, Ready, at Romulus and Remus--how hard they are digging with their\npaws there in the hollow.\"\n\n\"Thanks to Heaven that they are!  You don't know how happy you have made\nme feel: for, to tell you the truth, I was beginning to be alarmed.\"\n\n\"But why do they dig?\"\n\n\"Because there is water there, poor animals.  Now you see the advantage\nof having kept them in pain for a few hours; it is in all probability\nthe saving of all of us, for we must either have found water or quitted\nthis island.  Now let us help the poor dogs with the spade, and they\nshall soon be rewarded for their sufferings.\"\n\nReady walked quickly to where the dogs continued digging: they had\nalready got down to the moist earth, and were so eagerly at work, that\nit was with difficulty he could get them out of his way to use his\nspade.  He had not dug two feet before the water trickled down, and in\nfour or five minutes the dogs had sufficient to plunge their noses in,\nand to drink copiously.\n\n\"Look at them! how they enjoy it!  I don't think any Israelite felt more\ngrateful when Moses struck the rock than I do now, William.  This was\nthe one thing wanting, but it was the one thing indispensable.  Now we\nhave everything we can wish for on this island, and if we are only\ncontent, we may be happy--ay, much happier than are those who are\nworrying themselves to heap up riches, not knowing who shall gather\nthem.  See, the poor animals have had enough at last.  Now, shall we go\nback to breakfast?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied William: \"I shall enjoy it now, and have a good drink of\nwater myself.\"\n\n\"That is a plenteous spring, depend upon it,\" said Ready, as they walked\nback to where they had slept and left their knapsacks; \"but we must\nclear it out further up among the trees, where the sun cannot reach it,\nand then it will be cool, and not be dried up.  We shall have plenty of\nwork for the next year at least, if we remain here.  Where we are now\nwill be a capital spot to build our house on.\"\n\nAs soon as the breakfast was over, Ready said, \"Now we must go down and\nexplore the other point, for you see, William, I have not yet found a\npassage through the reef, and as our little boat must come round this\nside of the island, it is at the point on this side that I must try to\nfind an entrance.  When I was on the opposite point it did appear to me\nthat the water was not broken close to this point; and should there be a\npassage we shall be very fortunate.\"\n\nThey soon arrived at the end of the point of land, and found that Ready\nwas not wrong in his supposition; the water was deep, and there was a\npassage many yards wide.  The sea was so smooth, and the water so clear,\nthat they could see down to the rocky bottom, and watched the fish as\nthey darted along.  \"Look there!\" said Willy, pointing out about fifty\nyards from the beach, \"a great shark, Ready!\"\n\n\"Yes, I see him, sir,\" replied Ready: \"there's plenty of them here,\ndepend upon it; and you must be very careful how you get into the water:\nthe sharks always keep to the leeward of the island, and for one where\nJuno bathed your little brother, you will find fifty here.  I'm quite\nsatisfied now, William, we shall do very well, and all we have now to\nthink of is moving away from the other side of the island as fast as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Shall we go back to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so, for we shall only be idle here.  It is not twelve\no'clock, I should think, and we shall have plenty of time.  I think we\nhad better start at once; we will leave the spade and axe here, for it\nis no use taking them back again.  The musket I will take along.  But\nfirst let us go back and look at the spring, and see how the water\nflows.\"\n\nAs they walked along the edge of the sandy beach they found the\nsea-birds hovering close to them: all of a sudden a large shoal of fish\nthrew themselves high and dry on the sand, and they were followed by\nseveral of a larger size, which also lay flapping on the beach, while\nthe sea-birds, darting down close to the feet of William and Ready, and\nseizing up the fish, flew away with them.\n\n\"How very strange!\" said William, surprised.\n\n\"Yes, sir; but you see how it is--the small fish were chased by the\nlarger ones, which are bonettas, and in their fright ran upon the beach.\nThese bonettas were so anxious to catch them, that they came on shore\nalso, and then the gannets picked them all up.\"\n\nThey found the hole which Ready had dug quite full of water, and,\ntasting it, it proved very sweet and good.  Overjoyed at this discovery,\nthey covered up the articles they agreed to leave behind them with some\nboughs under the notched cocoa-nut trees, and, calling the dogs, set off\non their journey back again to the cove.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17.\n\nGuided by the marks made on the trees, William and Ready made rapid\nprogress in their return, and in less than two hours found themselves\nalmost clear of the wood which had taken them nearly eight hours to\nforce their way through the day before.\n\n\"I feel the wind now, Ready,\" observed William, \"and we must be nearly\nthrough the wood; but it appears to me to be very dark.\"\n\n\"I was just thinking the same,\" replied Ready.  \"I should not wonder if\nthere is a storm brewing up; and if so, the sooner we are back again the\nbetter.\"\n\nAs they proceeded, the rustling and waving of the boughs of the trees,\nand ever and anon a gust of wind, followed by a moaning and creaking\nsound, proved that such was the fact; and as they emerged from the\ngrove, they perceived that the sky, as it became visible to them, was of\none dark leaden hue, and no longer of the brilliant blue which it\nusually had presented to their sight.\n\n\"There is indeed a gale coming on,\" said Ready, as they cleared the\nwood: \"let us go on to the tents as fast as possible, for we must see\nthat all is as secure as we can make it.\"\n\nThe dogs now bounded forward; and at their appearance at the tents Mr\nSeagrave and Juno came out, and seeing Ready and William advancing, made\nknown the welcome tidings to Mrs Seagrave, who, with the children, had\nremained within.  In a moment more William was pressed in his mother's\narms.\n\n\"I am glad that you are come back, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, shaking\nhim by the hand after he had embraced William, \"for I fear that bad\nweather is coming on.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" replied Ready, \"and we must expect a blusterous\nnight.  This will be one of the storms which are forerunners of the\nrainy season.  However, we have good news for you, and must only take\nthis as a warning to hasten our departure as soon as possible.  We shall\nhave fine weather after this for a month or so, although we must expect\na breeze now and then.  But we must work hard and do our best; and now,\nif you please, you and Juno, William and I, will go and haul up the boat\nas far from the beach as we possibly can, for the waves will be high and\nrun a long way up, and our boat will be our main dependence soon.\"\n\nThe four went down as soon as Ready had sawed the ends of the spars\nwhich had been cut off, into three rollers, to fix under the keel; with\nthe help afforded by them, the boat was soon hauled up high into the\nbrushwood, where it was considered by Ready to be perfectly safe.\n\n\"I meant to have worked upon her immediately,\" observed Ready; \"but I\nmust wait now till the gale is over; and I did hope to have got on board\nonce more, and looked after some things which I have since remembered\nwould have been useful; but I strongly suspect,\" continued he, looking\nat the weather, \"that we shall never go on board of the poor vessel\nagain.  Hear the moaning of the coming storm, sir; look how the\nsea-birds wheel about and scream, as if to proclaim her doom; but we\nmust not wait here--the tents must be made more secure, for they will\nhave to hold up against no small force of wind, if I mistake not.\"\n\nReady, assisted by Mr Seagrave, now got out some heavy canvas and\nlines, and commenced putting it as a double cover over the tents, to\nkeep out the rain; they also secured the tents with guys and stays of\nrope, so as to prevent them being blown down; while Juno with a shovel\ndeepened the trench which had been made round the tents, so that the\nwater might run off more easily.  During the time they were at work,\nReady had made Mr Seagrave acquainted with what they had discovered and\ndone during the exploring expedition, and the adventure with the pigs\nmade them all laugh heartily.\n\nAs the sun went down, the weather threatened still more; the wind blew\nstrong, and the rocky beach was lashed by the waves and white with\nspray, while the surf roared as it poured in and broke upon the sand in\nthe cove.  The whole family had retired to bed except Ready, who said\nthat he would watch the weather a little before he turned in.  The old\nman walked towards the beach, and leaned against the gunnel of the boat,\nand there he remained with his keen grey eye fixed upon the distance,\nwhich was now one opaque mass, except where the white foam of the waters\ngleamed through the darkness of the night!  \"Yes!\" thought he; \"the\nwinds and the waves are summoned to do his bidding, and evenly do they\nwork together--as one rises, so does the other; when one howls, the\nother roars in concert--hand in hand they go in their fury and their\nforce.  Had they been called up but one week since, where would have\nbeen those who have now been, as it were, intrusted to my weak help?\nThe father, the mother, the children, the infant at the breast, and I,\nthe grey-headed old man,--all buried fathoms deep, awaiting our summons;\nbut they were restrained by his will, and by his will we were saved.\nWill those timbers which bore us here so miraculously hold together till\nmorning?  I should think not.  What are the iron bolts and fastenings of\nweak man, compared with the force of God's elements: they will snap as\nyarns; and by to-morrow's dawn, the fragments of the stout ship will be\nwashing and tossing on the wild surf.  Well, it will be a kindness to\nus, for the waters will perform the labour which we could not; they will\nbreak up the timbers for our use, and throw on shore from the hold those\narticles which we could not reach with our little strength.\"\n\nA sharp flash of lightning struck upon the old man's eyes, and\nobstructed his vision for the moment.  \"The storm will soon be at its\nheight,\" thought he; \"I will watch the tents, and see how they stand up\nagainst its force.\"  Then the rain came pattering down, and the wind\nhowled louder than before.  In a minute or two the darkness became so\nintense that he could hardly find his way back to the tents.  He turned\nround, but could not see, for he was blinded by the heavy rain.  As\nnothing could be done, he went into the tent and sheltered himself from\nthe storm, although he would not lie down, lest his services might be\nrequired.  The others had retired to bed, but with the exception of\nTommy and the children, they had not taken off their clothes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18.\n\nThe storm now raged furiously, the lightning was accompanied by loud\npeals of thunder, and the children awoke and cried with fright, till\nthey were hushed to sleep again.  The wind howled as it pressed with all\nits violence against the tents, while the rain poured off in torrents.\nOne moment the canvas of the tents would bulge in, and the cords which\nheld it strain and crack; at another, an eddy of wind would force out\nthe canvas, which would flap and flap, while the rain found many an\nentrance.  The tent in which Mrs Seagrave and the children reposed was\non the outside of the others, and therefore the most exposed.  About\nmidnight the wind burst on them with greater violence than before.  A\nloud crash was heard by Ready and Mr Seagrave, followed by the shrieks\nof Mrs Seagrave and Juno; the pegs of the tent had given way, and the\ninmates were exposed to the fury of the elements.  Ready rushed out,\nfollowed by Mr Seagrave and William.  So strong was the wind and\nbeating rain, and such was the darkness, that it was with some\ndifficulty that by their united efforts the women and children could be\nextricated.  Tommy was the first taken up by Ready: his courage had all\ngone, and he was bellowing furiously.  William took Albert in charge and\ncarried him into the other tent, where Tommy sat in his wet shirt\nroaring most melodiously.  Juno, Mrs Seagrave, and the little girl were\nat last carried away and taken into the other tent: fortunately no one\nwas hurt, although the frightened children could not be pacified, and\njoined in chorus with Tommy.  Nothing more could be done except to put\nthe children into bed, and then the whole party sat up the remainder of\nthe night listening to the noise of the wind, the roaring of the sea,\nand the loud patter of the rain against the canvas.  At dawn of day,\nReady went out, and found that the gale had spent its force, and had\nalready much abated; but it was not one of those bright glorious\nmornings to which they had been accustomed since their arrival at the\nisland: the sky was still dark, and the clouds were chasing each other\nwildly; there was neither sun nor blue sky to be seen: it still rained,\nbut only at intervals, and the earth was soft and spongy; the little\ncove, but the day before so beautiful, was now a mass of foaming and\ntumultuous waves, and the surf was thrown many yards upon the beach: the\nhorizon was confused--you could not distinguish the line between the\nwater and the sky, and the whole shore of the island was lined with a\nwhite foam.  Ready turned his eyes to where the ship had been fixed on\nthe rocks: it was no longer there--the whole frame had disappeared; but\nthe fragments of it, and the contents of the holds, were floating about\nin every direction, or tossing amongst the surf on the beach.\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Ready, pointing to where the ship had lain, as\nhe turned round and found that Mr Seagrave had followed him; \"look,\nsir, this gale has broken her up entirely.  This is a warning to us not\nto remain here any longer: we must make the most of the fine weather\nwhich we may have before the rainy season sets in.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave,--\"and there is another\nproof of it,\" pointing to the tent which had been blown down.  \"It was a\nmercy that none of them were hurt.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir; but the gale is breaking, and we shall have fine\nweather to-morrow.  Let us now see what we can do with the tent, while\nWilliam and Juno try if they can get any breakfast.\"\n\nThey set to work.  Ready and Mr Seagrave made it fast with fresh cords\nand pegs, and very soon had it all ready; but the beds and bedding were\nwet through.  They hauled over the wet canvas, and then left it to go to\ntheir breakfast, to which Juno had summoned them.\n\n\"We need do no more at present,\" said Ready, \"by night-time it will not\nbe so wet, and we can handle it easier.  I see a break in the sky now\nwhich promises fine weather soon.  And now we had better work hard\nto-day, for we may save a great many things, which may be dashed to\npieces on the rocks, if we do not haul them on the beach.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19.\n\nThey went down to the beach.  Ready first procured from the stores a\ngood stout rope; and as the waves threw up casks and timbers of the\nvessel, they stopped them from being washed back again, and either\nrolled or hauled them up with the rope until they were safely landed.\nThis occupied them for the major part of the day; and yet they had not\ncollected a quarter of the articles that were in their reach,\nindependent of the quantity which floated about out at sea and at the\nentrance of the cove.\n\n\"I think,\" said Ready, \"we have done a good day's work; tomorrow we\nshall be able to do much more, for the sea is going down, and the sun is\nshowing himself from the corner of that cloud.  Now we will go to\nsupper, and then see if we can make ourselves more comfortable for the\nnight.\"\n\nThe tent which had not been blown down was given to Mrs Seagrave and\nthe children, and the other was fitted up as well as it could be.  The\nbedding being all wet, they procured some sails from the stores, which,\nbeing stowed away farther in the grove, had not suffered much from the\ntempest; and, spreading the canvas, they lay down, and the night passed\nwithout any disaster, for the wind was now lulled to a pleasant breeze.\n\nThe next morning the sun shone bright--the air was fresh and bracing;\nbut a slight breeze rippled the waters, and there was little or no surf.\nThe various fragments of the wreck were tossed by the little surf that\nstill remained; many things were lying on the beach which had landed\nduring the night, and many more required but a little trouble to secure\nthem.  There appeared to be a sort of in draught into the cove, as all\nthe articles which had been floating out at sea were now gradually\ncoming on shore in that direction.  Ready and Mr Seagrave worked till\nbreakfast-time, and had by that time saved a great many casks and\npackages.\n\nAfter breakfast they went down again to the beach and resumed their\nlabours.  \"Look, Ready; what is that?\" said William, who was with them,\nas he pointed to a white-looking mass floating in the cove.\n\n\"That, sir, is the poor cow; and if you look again, you will see the\nsharks are around, making a feast of her: don't you see them?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do--what a quantity!\"\n\n\"Yes, there's no want of them, William; so be very careful how you get\ninto the water, and never let Tommy go near it, for they don't care how\nshallow it is when they see their food.  But now, sir,\" said Ready, \"I\nmust leave you and William to do what you can in saving any more of the\nwreck, while I set to and put the boat in proper repair.\"\n\nReady left them at their own employment, and went away for his tools.\nDuring this time Mr Seagrave and William occupied themselves in\ncollecting the different articles thrown on shore, and rolling up the\ncasks as far as they could.\n\nAs it would take some days for Ready to put the boat into proper order,\nMr Seagrave determined that he would go to the other side of the island\nwith William, that he might examine it himself; and, as Mrs Seagrave\nhad no objection to be left with Ready and Juno, on the third day after\nthe gale they set off.  William led the way, guiding his footsteps\nthrough the grove by the blazing of the cocoa-nut trees; and in two\nhours they reached their destination.\n\n\"Is not this beautiful, father?\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, indeed it is, my dear boy,\" replied Mr Seagrave.  \"I fancied that\nnothing could be more beautiful than the spot where we reside, but this\nsurpasses it, not only in variety, but in extent.\"\n\n\"And now let us examine the spring, father,\" said William, leading the\nway to the ravine.\n\nThe spring was full and flowing, and the water excellent.  They then\ndirected their steps towards the sandy beach, and, having walked some\ntime, sat down upon a coral rock.\n\n\"Who would have ever imagined, William,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"that this\nisland, and so many more which abound in the Pacific Ocean, could have\nbeen raised by the work of little insects not bigger than a pin's head?\"\n\n\"Insects, father?\" replied William.\n\n\"Yes, insects.  Give me that piece of dead coral, William.  Do you see\nthat on every branch there are a hundred little holes?  Well, in every\none of these little holes once lived a sea-insect; and as these insects\nincrease, so do the branches of the coral-trees.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand that; but how do you make out that this island was\nmade by them?\"\n\n\"Almost all the islands in these seas have been made by the labour and\nincrease of these small animals.  The coral grows at first at the bottom\nof the sea, where it is not disturbed by the winds or waves: by degrees,\nas it increases, it advances higher and higher to the surface, till at\nlast it comes near to the top of the water; then it is stopped in its\ngrowth by the force of the winds and waves, which break it off, and of\ncourse it never grows above the water, for if it did the animals would\ndie.\"\n\n\"Then how does it become an island?\"\n\n\"By very slow degrees; the time, perhaps, much depending upon chance:\nfor instance, a log of wood floating about, and covered with barnacles,\nmay ground upon the coral reefs; that would be a sufficient\ncommencement, for it would remain above water, and then shelter the\ncoral to leeward of it, until a flat rock had formed, level with the\nedge of the water.  The sea-birds are always looking for a place to rest\nupon, and they would soon find it, and then their droppings would, in\ncourse of time, form a little patch above water, and other floating\nsubstances would be thrown on it; and land-birds, who are blown out to\nsea, might rest themselves on it, and the seeds from their stomachs,\nwhen dropped, would grow into trees or bushes.\"\n\n\"I understand that.\"\n\n\"Well then, William, you observe there is an island commenced, as it\nwere, and, once commenced, it soon increases, for the coral would then\nbe protected to leeward, and grow up fast.  Do you observe how the coral\nreefs extend at this side of the island, where they are protected from\nthe winds and waves; and how different it is on the weather side, which\nwe have just left?  Just so the little patch above water protects the\ncorals to leeward, and there the island increases fast; for the birds\nnot only settle on it, but they make their nests and rear their young,\nand so every year the soil increases; and then, perhaps, one cocoa-nut\nin its great outside shell at last is thrown on these little patches--it\ntakes root, and becomes a tree, every year shedding its large branches,\nwhich are turned into mould as soon as they decay, and then dropping its\nnuts, which again take root and grow in this mould; and thus they\ncontinue, season after season, and year after year, until the island\nbecomes as large and as thickly covered with trees as the one we are now\nstanding upon.  Is not this wonderful, my dear boy?  Is not he a great\nand good God who can make such minute animals as these work his\npleasure, and at the time he thinks fit produce such a beautiful island\nas this?\"\n\n\"Indeed he is!\" exclaimed William.\n\n\"We only need use our eyes, William, and we shall love as well as adore.\nLook at that shell--is it not beautifully marked?--could the best\npainter in the world equal its colouring?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,--I should think not.\"\n\n\"And yet there are thousands of them in sight, and perhaps millions more\nin the water.  They have not been coloured in this way to be admired,\nlike the works of man; for this island has been till now probably\nwithout any one upon it, and no one has ever seen them.  It makes no\ndifference to Him, who has but to wish, and all is complete.\"\n\nFor a few minutes after this conversation, Mr Seagrave and William were\nboth silent.  Mr Seagrave then rose from where he was sitting: \"Come,\nWilliam, let us now find our way back again; we have three hours'\ndaylight left, and shall be home in good time.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20.\n\nEverything was now preparing for their removal to the leeward side of\nthe island.  Ready had nearly completed the boat; he had given it a\nthorough repair, and fitted a mast and sail.  William and Mr Seagrave\ncontinued to collect and secure the various articles thrown on shore,\nparticularly such as would be injured by their exposure to the weather:\nthese they rolled or carried into the cocoa-nut grove, so as to be\nsheltered from the sun; but there were so many things thrown on shore\nday after day, that they hardly knew what they had: but they secured\ncase and cask one after another, waiting for a better opportunity to\nexamine their contents.  At last they collected a great many articles\ntogether, and, with their shovels, covered them over with sand, it being\nimpossible to get them from the beach without more time than they could\nspare.\n\nNeither was Mrs Seagrave, who was now getting quite strong, or Juno,\nidle.  They had made up everything that they could in packages, ready\nfor moving.  On the eighth day after the gale, they were ready, and it\nwas arranged that Ready should put into the boat the bedding and canvas\nof one tent, and should take William with him on his expedition.  Having\ntransported this safe, he should return for a load of the most necessary\narticles, and then the family should walk through the grove to the other\nside of the island, and remain there with Mr Seagrave while Ready and\nWilliam returned for the other tent; and after that, the boat should\nmake as many trips as the weather would permit, till they had brought\nall the things absolutely required.  It was a lovely calm morning when\nReady and William pushed off in the boat, which was well loaded; and as\nsoon as they were clear of the cove they hoisted the sail, and went away\nbefore the wind along the coast.  In two hours they had run to the\neastern end of the island, and hauled up close inshore: the point which\nran out, and at the end of which there was an inlet, was not a mile from\nthem, and in a very short time they had lowered the sail, and were\npulling in for the sandy beach.\n\n\"You see, William, it is fortunate for us that we shall always have a\nfair wind when we come down loaded, and only have to pull our empty boat\nback again.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is.  How many miles do you think it is from the cove to this\npart of the island?\"\n\n\"About six or seven, not more: the island, you see, is long and narrow.\nNow let us get the things out and carry them up, and then we will be\nback to the cove long before dark.\"\n\nThe boat was soon unloaded, but they had some way to carry up the\nthings.  \"We shall not mind such a gale as we had the other day when our\ntents are pitched here, William,\" said Ready, \"for we shall be protected\nby the whole width of the cocoa-nut grove.  We shall hardly feel the\nwind, although we shall the rain, for that will come down in torrents.\"\n\n\"I must go and see how our spring gets on,\" said William, \"and get a\ndrink from it.\"\n\nWilly reported the spring to be up to the brim with water, and that he\nhad never drunk water so excellent.  They then pushed off the boat, and,\nafter rowing for about two hours or more, found themselves at the\nentrance of the cove, and Mrs Seagrave, with Tommy by her side, waving\nher handkerchief to them.\n\nThey very soon pulled in to the beach, and, landing, received the\ncongratulations of the whole party at their first successful voyage, and\nall expressed their delight at its having proved so much shorter than\nhad been anticipated.\n\n\"Tommy will go next time,\" said Master Tommy.\n\n\"By and by, when Tommy grows a little taller,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"Massa Tommy, you come help me to milk the goats,\" said Juno.\n\n\"Yes, Tommy milk the goats,\" said the little urchin, running after Juno.\n\n\"You must be almost tired of eating nothing but salt meat and biscuit,\nma'am,\" said Ready, as they sat down to their meal; \"but when we are all\nsafe on the other side of the island we hope to feed you better.  At\npresent it is hard work and hard fare.\"\n\n\"As long as the children are well, I care very little about it; but I\nmust say that, after the last gale, I am as anxious as you to be on the\nother side of the island, especially after the account William has given\nme of it.  It must be a paradise!  When do we set off?\"\n\n\"Not till the day after to-morrow, ma'am, I should think; for you see I\nmust have another trip for the cooking utensils and the bundles which\nyou have made up.  If you will spare Juno to walk through the wood with\nWilliam to-morrow, we will then have the tent ready for you and the\nchildren.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21.\n\nOld Ready had his boat loaded and had made sail for the other side of\nthe island long before the family were up; indeed, before they were\ndressed he had landed his whole cargo on the beach, and was sitting down\nquietly taking his breakfast.  As soon as he had eaten the beef and\nbiscuit which he had taken with him, he carried up the things which he\nhad brought, and commenced arrangements for setting up the tent,\nintending to await the arrival of William and Juno, that they might\nassist him in getting up the spars and canvas over it.\n\nAbout ten o'clock William made his appearance, leading one of the goats\nby a string, followed by the others.  Juno came after with the sheep,\nalso holding one with a cord; the rest had very quietly joined the\nprocession.  \"Here we are at last!\" said William laughing; \"we have had\nterrible work in the woods, for Nanny would run on one side of a tree\nwhen I went on the other, and then I had to let go the string.  We fell\nin with the pigs again, and Juno gave such a squall!\"\n\n\"I tink 'em wild beast,\" said Juno.  \"Ah! what a nice place!  Missis\nwill like to live here.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a very nice place, Juno; and you'll be able to wash here,\nand never mind about saving the water.\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" said William, \"how we are to get the fowls here; they\nare not very wild, but still we cannot catch them.\"\n\n\"I'll bring them with me to-morrow, William.\"\n\n\"But how will you catch them?\"\n\n\"Wait till they are gone to roost, and then you may catch them when you\nplease.\"\n\n\"And I suppose the pigeons and the pigs must run wild?\"\n\n\"The best thing we can do with them.\"\n\n\"Then we shall have to shoot them, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well, William, so we shall; and the pigeons also, when they have become\nplentiful, if we remain here so long.  We shall soon be well stocked and\nlive in plenty.  But now you must help me to get the tent up and\neverything in order, so that your mamma may find things comfortable on\nher arrival, for she will be very tired, I dare say, walking through the\nwood.\"\n\n\"Mamma is much better than she was,\" replied William.  \"I think she will\nsoon be quite strong again, especially when she comes to live at this\nbeautiful place.\"\n\n\"We have a great deal of work to do, more than we can get through before\nthe rainy season; which is a pity, but it can't helped; by this time\nnext year we shall be more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Why, what have we to do besides putting up the tents and shifting over\nhere?\"\n\n\"In the first place we have to build a house, and that will take a long\nwhile.  Then we ought to make a little garden, and sow the seeds which\nyour father brought from England with him.\"\n\n\"Oh! that will be nice; where shall we make it, Ready?\"\n\n\"We must put a fence across that point of land, and dig up all the\nbrushwood; the mould is very good.\"\n\n\"Then what next?\"\n\n\"Then we shall want a storehouse for all the things we have got, and all\nthat are in the wood and on the beach: and consider what a many trips we\nshall have to make with the little boat to bring them all round.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is very true, Ready.  Have we anything more to do?\"\n\n\"Plenty; we have to build a turtle-pond and a fish-pond, and a\nbathing-place for Juno to wash the children in.  But first we must make\na proper well at the spring, so as to have plenty of fresh water: now\nthere's enough for a year's hard work at least.\"\n\n\"Well, let us once get mamma and the children here, and we will work\nhard.\"\n\n\"I should wish very much to see it all done, William,\" said Ready.  \"I\nhope my life will be spared till it is done, at all events.\"\n\n\"But why do you say that, Ready? you are an old man, but you are strong\nand healthy.\"\n\n\"I am so now; but what does the Book say?--`In the midst of life we are\nin death.'  You are young and healthy, and promise a long life; but who\nknows but you may be summoned away tomorrow.  Can I, then, an old man,\nworn out with hardships, expect to live long?  No--no, William!  Still I\nshould like to remain here as long as I can be useful, and then I trust\nI may depart in peace.  I never wish to leave this island; and I have a\nkind of feeling that my bones will remain on it.  God's will be done!\"\n\nFor some time after Ready had finished, neither of them said a word, but\ncontinued their employment, stretching out the canvas of the tent, and\nfastening it down to the ground with pegs.  At last William broke the\nsilence.\n\n\"Ready, did you not say your Christian name was Masterman?\"\n\n\"So it is, William.\"\n\n\"It is a very odd Christian name!  You were called after some other\nperson?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was, William; he was a very rich man.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Ready, I should like very much if you will one day tell me\nyour history--I mean your whole life, from the time you were a boy.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I may, William; for there are many parts of my life which\nwould prove a lesson to others: but that must be after we have got\nthrough our work.\"\n\n\"How old are you, Ready?\"\n\n\"I am turned of sixty-four; a very old age for a seaman.  I could not\nobtain employment on board of a vessel if it were not that I am well\nknown to several captains.\"\n\n\"But why do you say `old for a seaman?'\"\n\n\"Because sailors live faster than other people, partly from the\nhardships which they undergo, and partly from their own fault in\ndrinking so much spirits; and then they are too often reckless and care\nnothing for their healths.\"\n\n\"But you never drink spirits now?\"\n\n\"No, never, William; but in my early days I was as foolish as others.\nNow, Juno, you may bring in the bedding.  We have two or three hours\nyet, William; what shall we do next?\"\n\n\"Had we not better make the fireplace all ready for cooking?\"\n\n\"It was what I was going to propose, if you had not.  I shall be here\nto-morrow long before any of you, and I will take care that supper is\nready on your arrival.\"\n\n\"I brought a bottle of water in my knapsack,\" replied William, \"not so\nmuch for the water, as because I want to milk the goats and take back\nthe milk for baby.\"\n\n\"You proved yourself not only thoughtful but kind, William: now while\nyou and Juno fetch the stones for the fireplace, I will stow away under\nthe trees the things I have brought in the boat.\"\n\n\"Shall we let the goats and sheep loose, Ready?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,--there is no fear of their straying; the herbage here is\nbetter than on the other side, and there is plenty of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I will let Nanny go as soon as Juno has milked her.  Now, Juno,\nlet us see how many stones we can carry at once.\"\n\nIn an hour the fireplace was made, Ready had done all that he could, the\ngoats were milked and let loose, and then William and Juno set off on\ntheir journey back.\n\nReady went down to the beach.  On his arrival there, he observed a small\nturtle: creeping up softly he got between it and the water, and\nsucceeded in turning it over.  \"That will do for to-morrow,\" said he, as\nhe stepped into the boat; and laying hold of the oars, he pulled out of\nthe bay to return to the cove.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22.\n\nReady arrived at the cove, and proceeded to the tents, where he found\nthe whole party listening to William, who was detailing what had been\ndone.  The arrangements for the next day were made as soon as Ready\njoined them.  They then separated for the night, but Ready and William\nremained until it was dark, to catch the fowls and tie their legs, ready\nfor their being put in the boat the next morning.  At daylight all were\nsummoned to dress themselves as soon as possible, as Ready wanted to\ntake down the tent in which Mrs Seagrave and the children had slept.\nFor, with the exception of Tommy, the others had slept upon some canvas,\nwhich they had spread out under the cocoa-nut trees.  As soon as Mrs\nSeagrave was dressed, the tent was taken down, and, with all the\nbedding, put into the boat.  Then, when they had breakfasted, the\nplates, knives and forks, and some other necessaries, were also put in;\nReady laid the fowls on the top of all, and set off by himself for their\nnew location.\n\nAfter he was gone, the rest of the party prepared for their journey\nthrough the cocoa-nut grove.  William led the way, with the three dogs\nclose to his heels, Mr Seagrave with the baby in his arms, Juno with\nlittle Caroline, and Mrs Seagrave with Master Tommy holding her hand.\nThey cast a last look round at the cove, and the fragments of the wreck\nand cargo, strewed about in every direction, and then turned into the\nwood.  Ready arrived at the point, and was again on shore in less than\ntwo hours after he had set off.  As soon as the boat was safe in, he did\nnot wait to land his cargo, but going up to the turtle which he had\nturned the day before, he killed it, and cleaned it on the beach.  He\nthen went to where they had built up the fireplace with stones, made a\nfire, filled the iron saucepan full of water, and set it on to boil; he\nthen cut up a portion of the turtle, and put it into the pot, with some\nslices of salt pork, covered it up, and left it to boil; and having hung\nup the rest of the turtle in the shade, he went back to the beach to\nunload the boat.  He released the poor fowls, and they were soon busy\nseeking for food.\n\nIt was two or three hours before he had carried everything up, for it\nwas a good distance, and some of the articles were heavy, and the old\nman was not sorry when he had finished his task, and could sit down to\nrest himself.\n\n\"It's almost time they arrived,\" thought Ready; \"they must have started\nnearly four hours ago.\"  Ready remained a quarter of an hour more\nwatching the fire, and occasionally skimming the top of the pot, when\nthe three dogs came bounding towards him.\n\n\"Well, they are not far off now,\" observed Old Ready.\n\nIn six or seven minutes afterwards the party made their appearance, very\nhot and very fatigued.  It appeared that poor little Caroline had been\ntired out, and Juno had to carry her; then Mrs Seagrave complained of\nfatigue, and they had to rest a quarter of an hour; then Tommy, who\nrefused to remain with his mamma, and had been running backwards and\nforwards from one to the other, had declared that he was tired, and that\nsomeone must carry him; but there was no one to carry him, so he began\nto cry until they stopped for another quarter of an hour till he was\nrested; then as soon as they went on again he again complained of being\ntired.  William then carried him pickaback for some time, and in so\ndoing he missed the blaze-cut on the trees, and it was a long while\nbefore he could find it again; then baby became hungry, and he cried,\nand little Caroline was frightened at being so long in the wood, and she\ncried.  But finally they got on better, and arrived at last so warm and\nexhausted, that Mrs Seagrave went into the tent with the children to\nrepose a little, before she could even look at the place which was to be\ntheir future residence.\n\n\"I think,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"that this little journey of to-day has\nbeen a pretty good proof of how helpless we should have been without\nyou, Ready.\"\n\n\"I am glad that you are here, sir,\" replied Ready, \"it is a weight off\nmy mind; now you will get on better.  I think that after a while you may\nlive very comfortably here; but still we have much to do.  As soon as\nMadam has rested, we will have our dinner and then fix up our own tent,\nwhich will be quite enough after such a hard day's work.\"\n\n\"Do you go back to the cove to-morrow, Ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we want our stores here; it will take about three trips to\nempty our storehouses; and as to the other things, we can examine them\nand bring them down at our leisure.  As soon as I have made those three\ntrips in the boat, we can then work here altogether.\"\n\n\"But I can do something in the meantime.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, there is plenty for you to do.\"\n\nMr Seagrave went into the tent, and found his wife much refreshed; but\nthe children had all fallen fast asleep on the beds.  They waited\nanother half-hour, and then woke Tommy and Caroline, that they might all\nsit down to dinner.\n\n\"Dear me,\" exclaimed William, as Ready took the cover off the saucepan,\n\"what is it that you have so good there?\"\n\n\"It's a treat I have prepared for you all,\" replied Ready.  \"I know that\nyou are tired of salt meat, so now you are going to feed like aldermen.\"\n\n\"Why, what is it, Ready?\" said Mrs Seagrave; \"it smells very good.\"\n\n\"It is turtle-soup, ma'am; and I hope you will like it; for, if you do,\nyou may often have it, now that you are on this side of the island.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it really is excellent; but it wants a little salt.  Have you\nany salt, Juno?\"\n\n\"Got a little, ma'am.  Very little left,\" replied Juno.\n\n\"What shall we do when all our salt is gone?\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Juno must get some more,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"How I get salt?--hab none left,\" replied Juno, looking at Ready.\n\n\"There's plenty out there, Juno,\" said Mr Seagrave, pointing to the\nsea.\n\n\"I don't know where,\" said Juno, looking in that direction.\n\n\"What do you mean, my dear?\" inquired Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"I only mean if we want salt we can have as much as we please by boiling\ndown salt-water in the kettle, or else making a salt-pan in the rocks,\nand obtaining it by the sun drying up the water and leaving the salt.\nSalt is always procured in that way, either by evaporation, or boiling.\"\n\n\"I'll soon arrange that for you, ma'am,\" said Ready, \"and show Juno how\nto get it when she wants it.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear you say so; for I should feel the want of salt\nvery much,\" replied Mrs Seagrave, \"I really never enjoyed a dinner so\nmuch as I have to-day.\"\n\nThe soup was pronounced excellent by everybody.  As soon as they had\nfinished, Mrs Seagrave remained with the children; and Ready and Mr\nSeagrave, assisted by Juno and William, got the second tent up, and\neverything ready for the night.  They then all assembled, and returned\nthanks to God for their having gained their new abode; and, tired out\nwith the fatigue of the day, were soon fast asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23.\n\nMr Seagrave was the first up on the ensuing morning; and when Ready\ncame out of the tent, he said to him, \"Do you know, Ready, I feel much\nhappier and my mind much more at ease since I find myself here.  On the\nother side of the island everything reminded me that we had been\nshipwrecked; and I could not help thinking of home and my own country;\nbut here we appear as if we had been long settled, and as if we had come\nhere by choice.\"\n\n\"I trust that feeling will be stronger every day, sir; for it's no use,\nand indeed sinful, to repine.\"\n\n\"I acknowledge it, and with all humility.  What is the first thing which\nyou wish we should set about?\"\n\n\"I think, sir, the first object is to have a good supply of fresh water;\nand I therefore wish you and William--Here he is.  Good-morning,\nWilliam--I was saying that I thought it better that Mr Seagrave and you\nshould clear out the spring while I am away in the boat.  I brought\nanother shovel with me yesterday, and you both can work; perhaps we had\nbetter go there, as Juno, I see, is getting the breakfast ready.  You\nobserve, Mr Seagrave, we must follow up the spring till we get among\nthe cocoa-nut trees, where it will be shaded from the sun; that is\neasily done by digging towards them, and watching how the water flows.\nThen, if you will dig out a hole large enough to sink down in the earth\none of the water-casks which lie on the beach, I will bring it down with\nme this afternoon; and then, when it is fixed in the earth in that way,\nwe shall always have the cask full of water for use, and the spring\nfilling it as fast as we empty it.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"that shall be our task while you\nare absent.\"\n\n\"Now, I have nothing more to do than to speak to Juno about dinner,\"\nreplied Ready; \"and then I'll just take a mouthful, and be off.\"\n\nReady directed Juno to fry some pork in the frying-pan, and then to cut\noff some slices from the turtle, and cook turtle-steaks for dinner, as\nwell as to warm up the soup which was left; and then, with a biscuit and\na piece of beef in his hand, he went down to the boat and set off for\nthe cove.  Mr Seagrave and William worked hard; and, by twelve o'clock,\nthe hole was quite large and deep enough, according to the directions\nReady had given.  They then left their work and went to the tent.\n\n\"You don't know how much happier I am now that I am here,\" said Mrs\nSeagrave, taking her husband's hand, as he seated himself by her.\n\n\"I trust it is a presentiment of future happiness, my dear,\" said Mr\nSeagrave.  \"I assure you that I feel the same, and was saying so to\nReady this morning.\"\n\n\"I feel that I could live here for ever, it is so calm and beautiful;\nbut I miss one thing--there are no birds singing here as at home.\"\n\n\"I have seen no birds except sea-birds, and of them there is plenty.\nHave you, William?\"\n\n\"Only once, father.  I saw a flight a long way off.  Ready was not with\nme, and I could not tell what they were; but they were large birds, as\nbig as pigeons, I should think.  There is Ready coming round the point,\"\ncontinued William.  \"How fast that little boat sails!  It is a long\npull, though, for the old man when he goes to the cove.\"\n\n\"Let us go down and help Ready carry up some of the things before\ndinner,\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\nThey did so; and William rolled up the empty water-cask which Ready had\nbrought with him.\n\nThe turtle-steaks were as much approved of as the turtle-soup; indeed,\nafter having been so long on salt meat, a return to fresh provisions was\ndelightful.\n\n\"And now to finish our well,\" said William, as soon as dinner was over.\n\n\"How hard you do work, William!\" said his mother.\n\n\"So I ought, mother.  I must learn to do everything now.\"\n\n\"And that you will very soon,\" said Ready.\n\nThey rolled the cask to the spring, and, to their astonishment, found\nthe great hole which they had dug not two hours before quite full of\nwater.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" said William, \"we shall have to throw all the water out to\nget the cask down.\"\n\n\"Think a little, William,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"for the spring runs so\nfast that it will not be an easy task.  Cannot we do something else?\"\n\n\"Why, father, the cask will float, you know,\" replied William.\n\n\"To be sure it will as it is; but is there no way of making it sink?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  I know--we must bore some holes in the bottom, and then it\nwill fill and sink down of itself.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Ready.  \"I expected that we should have to do that,\nand have the big gimlet with me.\"\n\nReady bored three or four holes in the bottom of the cask, and as it\nfloated the water ran into it, and by degrees it gradually sank down.\nAs soon as the top of the cask was level with the surface they filled in\nall round with the spade and shovel, and the well was completed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Mr Seagrave observed:\n\"Now that we have so many things to do, I think, Ready, we ought to lay\ndown a plan of operations; method is everything when work is to be done:\nnow tell me what you propose shall be our several occupations for the\nnext week, for to-morrow is Sunday; and although we have not yet been\nable to honour the day as we should, I think that now we must and ought\nto keep it holy.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Ready.  \"To-morrow we will rest from our labour, and\nask God's blessing upon our endeavours during the six days of the week;\nand now, as to your proposition, Mr Seagrave, shall we begin first with\nthe lady?\"\n\n\"You must not consider that you have ladies with you now, Ready,\" said\nMrs Seagrave, \"at least, not fine ladies.  My health and strength are\nrecovering fast, and I mean to be very useful.  I propose to assist Juno\nin all the domestic duties, such as the cookery and washing, to look\nafter and teach the children, mend all the clothes, and make all that is\nrequired, to the best of my ability.  If I can do more I will.\"\n\n\"I think we may be satisfied with that, Mr Seagrave,\" replied Ready.\n\"Now, sir, the two most pressing points, with the exception of building\nthe house, are to dig up a piece of ground, and plant our potatoes and\nseeds; and to make a turtle-pond, so as to catch the turtle and put them\nin before the season is over.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"but which ought to be done\nfirst?\"\n\n\"I should say the turtle-pond, as it will be only a few days' work for\nyou, Juno, and William.  I shall not want your assistance for this next\nweek.  I shall fix upon some spot, not far from here, where the trees\nare thickest in the grove, and cut them down so as to clear out a space\nin which we will, by and by, build our storerooms; and, as soon as the\nrainy season has gone by, we can remove all our stores from the other\nside of the island.  It will occupy me the whole of the week, cutting\ndown the trees and sawing them into proper lengths, ready for building\nthe house, and then we must all join our strength and get it up without\ndelay.\"\n\n\"Can you really manage to get it up in time?  How soon do you expect the\nrains will come on?\"\n\n\"In three or four weeks.  After next week, I shall probably have the\nassistance of two of you, if not of all.  Now I think of it, I must\nreturn to the cove.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Don't you recollect, sir, your two-wheeled carriage, packed up in\nmatting, which was thrown on shore in the gale?  You laughed when you\nsaw it, and said it would be of little use now; but the wheels and axle\nwill be very useful, as we can make a wide path to the place when I cut\ndown the trees, and wheel out the logs much more easily than we can drag\nor carry them.\"\n\n\"That is an excellent idea.  It will save a great deal of labour.\"\n\n\"I expect that it will, sir.  William and I will go away early on Monday\nmorning, and be back before breakfast.  To-day we will fix upon the\nspots where our garden is to be, our turtle-pond to be made, and the\ntrees to be cut down.  That shall be our business, Mr Seagrave; and\nWilliam and Juno may put things a little more to rights here.\"\n\nMr Seagrave and Ready then walked down to the beach, and, after\nsurveying the reefs for some time, Ready said, \"You see, Mr Seagrave,\nwe do not want too much water for a turtle-pond, as, if it is too deep,\nthere is a difficulty in catching them when we want them: what we want\nis a space of water surrounded by a low wall of stones, so that the\nanimals cannot escape, for they cannot climb up, although they can walk\non the shelving sand with their flippers.  Now the reef here is high out\nof the water, and the space within the reef and the beach is deep\nenough, and the rocks on the beach nearly fill up that side and prevent\nthem crawling away by the shore.  We have, therefore, little more to do\nthan to fill up the two other sides, and then our pond will be\ncomplete.\"\n\n\"I see it will not be a long job either, if we can find loose rocks\nenough,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Almost all those which are on the beach are loose,\" replied Ready, \"and\nthere are plenty close to us: some of them will be too heavy to carry,\nbut they can be brought here by the aid of handspikes and crowbars.\nSuppose we make a signal for William and Juno, and set them to work.\"\n\nMr Seagrave called and waved his hat, and Juno and William came down to\nthem.  Juno was ordered to go back for two handspikes, while Ready\nexplained to William what was to be done.  Having stayed with them and\nassisted them for some time after Juno had returned with the implements,\nMr Seagrave and Ready proceeded to the point, to fix upon a spot for a\ngarden, leaving William and Juno to continue their labour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25.\n\nMr Seagrave and Ready then continued their way along the beach, until\nthey arrived at the point which the latter had considered as a\nconvenient place to make the garden.  They found a sufficiency of mould;\nand as the point was narrow at its joining on to the mainland, no great\nlength of enclosure would be required.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said Ready, \"we can wait till after the rainy season is\nover before we put up the fence, and we can prepare it in the meantime,\nwhen the weather will permit us to work.  The seeds and potatoes will\nnot come up until after the rains are finished; so all we have to do is\nto dig up the ground, and put them in as fast as we can.  We cannot make\na large garden this year; but our potatoes we must contrive to get in,\nif we cannot manage anything else.\"\n\n\"If we have no fence to make,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"I think we shall\nbe able to clear away quite enough ground in a week to put in all that\nwe require.\"\n\n\"The first job will be to pull up the small brushwood,\" said Ready, \"and\nturn up the ground; the larger plants we must leave, if we have not\ntime.  Tommy might be of some use here in taking away the shrubs as you\npull them up; but we had better now go on to the grove, and choose the\nspot for cutting down the trees.  I have made my mark.\"\n\nReady and Mr Seagrave proceeded in the direction which the former had\npointed out, until they arrived at a spot on a rising ground, where the\ntrees were so thick that it was not very easy to pass through them.\n\n\"There is the place,\" said Ready.  \"I propose to cut all the timber we\nwant for the houses out of this part of the grove, and to leave an open\nsquare place, in the centre of which we will build our storerooms.  You\nsee, sir, if necessary, with a very little trouble we might turn it into\na place of protection and defence, as a few palisades here and there\nbetween the trees would make it, what they call in the East Indies, a\nstockade.\"\n\n\"Very true, but I trust we shall not require it for such a purpose.\"\n\n\"I hope so too, but there is nothing like being prepared; however, we\nhave plenty to do before we can think of that.  Now, sir, as dinner is\nready, suppose we return, and after dinner we will both commence our\ntasks.\"\n\nJuno and William returned to the dinner which Mrs Seagrave had\nprepared.  They were both very warm with their work, which was very\nhard, but very eager to finish their task.  After dinner was over, Mrs\nSeagrave requested her husband, as he was about to go down to the point,\nwith the spade and a small hatchet in his hand, to take Tommy with him,\nas she had a great deal to do, and could not watch him as well as the\nbaby and Caroline.  So Mr Seagrave took Tommy by the hand, and led him\nto the point, and made him sit down close to him while he cleared away\nthe brushwood.\n\nMr Seagrave worked very hard, and when he had cut down and cleared a\nportion of the ground, he made Tommy carry away to a little distance,\nand pile in a heap, the bushes which he had cleared away.  When Mr\nSeagrave had cleared away a large piece of ground with his hatchet, he\nthen took his spade to dig at the roots and turn up the mould, leaving\nTommy to amuse himself.  What Tommy did for about an hour, during which\nMr Seagrave worked very diligently, his father did not observe; but all\nof a sudden he began to cry; and when his father asked him the reason,\nhe did not answer, but only cried the more, until at last he put his\nhands to his stomach, and roared most lustily.  As he appeared to be in\nvery great pain, his father left off work, and led him up to the tent,\nwhen Mrs Seagrave came out, alarmed at his cries.  Ready, who had heard\nTommy screaming for so long a while, thought that there might be\nsomething serious, and left his work to ascertain the cause.  When he\nheard what had passed, he said:\n\n\"Depend upon it, the child has eaten something which has made him ill.\nTell me, Tommy, what did you eat when you were down there?\"\n\n\"Berries,\" roared Tommy.\n\n\"I thought as much, ma'am,\" said Ready.  \"I must go and see what the\nberries were.\"  And the old man hastened down to the place where Mr\nSeagrave had been at work.  In the meantime Mrs Seagrave was much\nalarmed lest the child should have poisoned himself, and Mr Seagrave\nwent to search among the medicines for some castor-oil.\n\nReady returned just as he came back to the tent with the bottle of\ncastor-oil, and he told Ready that he was about to give Tommy a dose.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Ready, who had a plant in his hand, \"I don't think\nyou should give him any, for it appears to me that he has taken too much\nalready.  This is, if I recollect right, the castor-oil plant, and here\nare some of the castor-oil beans which Master Tommy has been eating.\nTell me, Tommy, did you eat them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Tommy.\n\n\"I thought so: give him a little warm drink, ma'am, and he'll soon be\nbetter: it will teach him not to eat berries or beans again.\"\n\nWhat Ready said was true; nevertheless Master Tommy was very ill for the\nwhole of the day, and was put early to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26.\n\nThe next day, when Mr Seagrave, William, Juno, and Ready were all at\nwork at their allotted tasks, Mrs Seagrave was sitting down at the\nfront of the tent, the little baby, Albert, crawling close to her,\nCaroline trying to work with her needle, and Tommy was making holes in\nthe ground, and putting a small stone into each hole.\n\n\"What are you doing, Tommy?\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"I'm making a garden,\" replied Tommy.\n\n\"Making a garden!  Then you ought to plant some trees in it.\"\n\n\"No; I'm sowing seeds: look here,\" replied Tommy, pointing to the\nstones.\n\n\"But these are stones, not seeds.\"\n\n\"Well, but I pretend, and that's the same thing,\" replied Tommy.\n\n\"Not exactly, Tommy; suppose, instead of eating those beans yesterday,\nyou had only pretended to eat them, wouldn't it have been better?\"\n\n\"I won't eat any more,\" replied Tommy.\n\n\"No, not of those beans; but if you saw anything else which you thought\nyou would like, I am afraid you would eat it, and be as ill and even\nworse than you were.\"\n\n\"I like cocoa-nuts; why don't we have some? there's plenty upon the\ntrees.\"\n\n\"But who is to climb up so high, Tommy?  Can you?\"\n\n\"No; but why don't Ready climb, or papa, or William?\"\n\n\"I suppose they will get some by and by, when they are not so busy, but\nthey have no time now.\"\n\n\"I like turtle-soup,\" replied Tommy.\n\n\"William and Juno are making a pond to put turtle in, and then we shall\nhave it oftener; but we cannot have everything we like when we wish for\nit.\"\n\n\"I like fried fish,\" said Tommy; \"why don't we have fried fish?\"\n\n\"Because every one is too busy to catch them just now.  Tommy, go and\nbring your brother Albert back; he has crawled too near to Billy, and he\nbutts sometimes.\"\n\nTommy went after the baby, who was crawling towards the kid, which had\nnow grown pretty large, and as he took up his brother he kicked at the\ngoat's head.\n\n\"Don't do that, Tommy; he'll butt at you, and hurt you.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" replied Tommy, holding the baby by one hand while he\ncontinued to kick at Billy.  Billy, however, would not stand it; he\nlowered his head, made a butt at Tommy, and he and Albert rolled on the\nground one over the other.  The baby roared, and Tommy began to whimper.\nMrs Seagrave ran up to them and caught up the baby; and Tommy,\nalarmed, caught hold of his mother's dress for protection, looking\nbehind him at Billy, who appeared inclined to renew the attack.\n\n\"Why don't you mind what is said to you, Tommy?  I told you that he\nwould butt you,\" said Mrs Seagrave, pacifying the child.\n\n\"I don't care for him,\" replied Tommy, who perceived that the goat was\nwalking away.\n\n\"No, you are very brave now that he has gone; but you're a very naughty\nboy not to mind what is said to you.\"\n\n\"Billy never butts at me, mamma,\" said Caroline.\n\n\"No, my dear, because you do not tease him; but your brother is very\nfond of teasing animals, and so he gets punished and frightened.  It is\nvery wrong of him to do so, especially as he is told by his father and\nme that he ought not.\"\n\n\"You said I was a good boy when I learnt my lesson this morning,\"\nreplied Tommy.\n\n\"Yes, but you should always be good,\" replied his mother.\n\n\"I can't be always good,\" said Tommy; \"I want my dinner.\"\n\n\"It is dinner-time, Tommy, that is certain, but you must wait until they\nall come home from their work.\"\n\n\"There's Ready coming, with a bag on his shoulder,\" replied Tommy.\n\nReady soon came up to where Mrs Seagrave was sitting, and laid down the\nbag.  \"I've brought you some young cocoa-nuts, and some old ones also,\nfrom the trees that I have been cutting down.\"\n\n\"Oh! cocoa-nuts--I like cocoa-nuts!\" cried Tommy.\n\n\"I told you, Tommy, that we should have some by and by, and they have\ncome sooner than we thought.  You are very warm, Ready.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Ready, wiping his face; \"it is rather warm work,\nfor there is no breeze in the grove to cool one.  Is there anything you\nwant from the other side of the island, for I shall go there directly\nafter dinner?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I must bring the wheels to get the timber out; for I must clear it away\nas I go, until the path is finished.  I must have William to help me.\"\n\n\"William will like the trip, I do not doubt.  I do not recollect\nanything in particular that we want, Ready,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.\n\"There he comes with Juno, and I see Mr Seagrave has laid down his\nspade; so Caroline, dear, take care of Albert, while I get the dinner\nfor them.\"\n\nReady assisted Mrs Seagrave, and the dinner was spread out on the\nground, for they had not brought the chairs and tables with them to\ntheir new residence, as they thought that they could do without them\ntill the house was built.  William reported that Juno and he would have\nthe turtle-pond complete by the next day.  Mr Seagrave had cleared\nsufficient ground to plant the half-sack of potatoes that they had\nsaved, so that in a day or two they would be able to put all their\nstrength upon the cutting and drawing of the timber.\n\nAfter dinner, William and Ready set off in the boat, and, before it was\ndark, returned with the wheels and axle of the carriage, and several\nother articles to make up their load.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27.\n\n\"Now, William,\" said Ready, \"if you are not very sleepy, perhaps you\nwould like to come with me to-night, and see if we cannot turn some of\nthe turtle, for the season is going away fast, and they will leave the\nisland very soon.\"\n\nAs soon as the sun had disappeared, William and Ready went down to the\nbeach, and sat quietly on a rock.  In a short time, Ready perceived a\nturtle crawling on the sand, and, desiring William to follow him without\nspeaking, walked softly down by the water's edge, so as to get between\nthe animal and the sea.\n\nAs soon as the turtle perceived them, it made for the water, but they\nmet it; and Ready, seizing hold of one of its fore-flippers, turned it\nover on its back.\n\n\"You see, William, that is the way to turn a turtle: take care that he\ndoes not catch you with his mouth, for, if he did, he would bite the\npiece out.  Now the animal cannot get away, for he can't turn over\nagain, and we shall find him here to-morrow morning; so we will now walk\nalong the beach, and see if we cannot find some more.\"\n\nReady and William remained till past midnight, and turned sixteen\nturtle.\n\n\"I think that will do, William, for once: we have made a good night's\nwork of it, for we have provided food for many days.  Tomorrow we must\nput them all into the pond.\"\n\n\"How shall we carry such large animals?\"\n\n\"We need not carry them; we must put some old canvas under them, and\nhaul them along by that means; we can easily do that on the smooth\nsand.\"\n\n\"Why don't we catch some fish, Ready?  We might put them into the\nturtle-pond.\"\n\n\"They would not stay there long, William, nor could we easily get them\nout if they did.  I have often thought of getting some lines ready, and\nyet the time has never come, for I feel sleepy after our day's work; but\nas soon as the house is built, we will have them, and you shall be\nfisherman-in-chief.\"\n\n\"But the fish will bite at night, will they not?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, and better than they do in the daytime.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you will get me a line and show me how, I will fish for\nan hour or so after the work is done; I know mamma is getting tired of\nsalt meat, and does not think it good for Caroline.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will get a bit of candle to-morrow night, and fit up two\nfishing-lines.  But I must go with you, William.  We don't use much\ncandle, at all events.\"\n\n\"No, we are too glad to go to bed: but there are two or three boxes of\none sort or another up in the cove.\"\n\nThe next morning before breakfast all hands were employed in getting the\nturtle into the pond.  After breakfast, William and Juno finished the\npond where the walls had not been raised high enough; and, when they\nreturned to dinner, reported that their task was completed.  Mr\nSeagrave also said that he had, he thought, cleared quite ground enough\nfor the present; and as Mrs Seagrave wanted Juno to help her to wash\nthe linen that afternoon, it was agreed that William, Ready, and Mr\nSeagrave should all go down to the garden, and put in the potatoes.\n\nReady worked with the spade, while Mr Seagrave and William cut the\npotatoes in pieces, so as to have an eye in each piece.  When they had\nfinished this work, Mr Seagrave said--\"Now that we have finished\ncutting the potatoes, let us go and assist Ready in planting them and\nthe seeds which we have brought down with us.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28.\n\nThat night Ready sat up for two or three hours working by candle-light\n(William keeping him company), very busily engaged fitting up the\nfishing-lines with leads and hooks.  At last two were complete.\n\n\"What bait must we use, Ready?\"\n\n\"I should think that the best would be one of the fish out of the shells\nwhich are in the sand; but a piece of pork fat will, I dare say, do as\nwell.\"\n\n\"And whereabouts would you fish, Ready?\"\n\n\"The best place, I should think, would be at the farthermost end of the\npoint, where I got the boat through the reef--the water is deep there\nclose to the rocks.\"\n\n\"I was thinking, Ready, if those gannets and men-of-war birds would be\ngood eating.\"\n\n\"Not very, William; they are very tough and very fishy: we must try for\nthose when we can get nothing better.  Now that we have got in the seeds\nand potatoes, we must all set to to-morrow morning to fell and carry the\ntimber.  I think Mr Seagrave had better use the axe with me; and you\nand Juno can, when I have shown you how, hang the timber to the axle,\nand wheel it out to the place where we have decided upon building the\nhouse.  And now we had better go to bed.\"\n\nWilliam, however, had made up his mind to do otherwise: he knew that his\nmother would be very glad to have some fish, and he determined, as the\nmoon shone bright, to try if he could not catch some before he went to\nbed; so he waited very quietly till he thought Ready was asleep as well\nas the others, and then went out with the lines, and went down to the\nbeach, where he picked up three or four shells, and, breaking them\nbetween two pieces of rock, took out the fish and baited his hooks.  He\nthen walked to the point.  It was a beautiful night; the water was very\nsmooth, and the moonbeams pierced deep below the surface.  William threw\nin his line, and as soon as the lead touched the bottom he pulled it up\nabout a foot, as Ready had instructed him; and he had not held his line\nmore than half a minute, when it was jerked so forcibly, that not\nexpecting it he was nearly hauled into the water; as it was, the fish\nwas so strong that the line slipped through his hand and scored his\nfingers; but after a time he was able to pull it in, and he landed on\nthe beach a large silver-scaled fish, weighing nine or ten pounds.  As\nsoon as he had dragged it so far away from the edge of the rocks as to\nprevent its flapping into the water again, William took out the hook and\ndetermined to try for another.  His line was down as short a time as\nbefore, when it was again jerked with violence; but William was this\ntime prepared, and he let out the line and played the fish till it was\ntired, and then pulled it up, and found that the second fish was even\nlarger than the first.  Satisfied with his success, he wound up his\nlines, and, running a piece of string through the gills of the fish,\ndragged them back to the tents, and hanged them to the pole, for fear of\nthe dogs eating them; he then went in, and was soon fast asleep.  The\nnext morning William was the first up, and showed his prizes with much\nglee; but Ready was very much displeased with him.\n\n\"You did very wrong, William, to run the risk which you did.  If you\nwere resolved to catch fish, why did you not tell me, and I would have\ngone with you?  You say, yourself, that the fish nearly hauled you into\nthe water; suppose it had done so, or suppose a small shark instead of\none of these gropers (as we call them) had taken the bait, you must have\nbeen jerked in; and the rocks are so steep there, that you would not\nhave been able to get out again before a shark had hold of you.  Think a\nmoment what would have been the distress of your father and the agony\nand despair of your poor mother, when this news should have arrived.\"\n\n\"I was very wrong, Ready,\" replied William, \"now that I think of it; but\nI wanted to surprise and please my mother.\"\n\n\"That reason is almost sufficient to plead your pardon, my dear boy,\"\nreplied Ready; \"but don't do so again.  And now let us say no more about\nit; nobody will know that you have been in danger, and there's no harm\ndone; and you mustn't mind an old man scolding you a little.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, Ready, I do not, for I was very thoughtless; but I had no\nidea that there was danger.\"\n\n\"There's your mother coming out of her tent,\" replied Ready.\n\"Good-morning, madam.  Do you know what William has done for you last\nnight?  Look, here are two beautiful fish, and very excellent eating\nthey are, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"I am quite delighted,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.\n\nTommy clapped his hands and danced about, crying, \"Fried fish for\ndinner;\" and Juno said, \"Have very fine dinner to-day, Missy Caroline.\"\n\nAfter breakfast they all set out for the grove, where Ready had been\ncutting down the trees, taking with them the wheels and axle, and a\ncouple of stout ropes.  Mr Seagrave and Ready cut down the trees and\nslung them to the axle, and Juno and William dragged them to the spot\nwhere the house was to be built.\n\nThey were not sorry when dinner was ready, for it was very hard work.\n\nThat night, tired as they were, Ready and William went out, and turned\neight more turtle.  They continued felling the cocoa-nut trees and\ndragging the timber for the remainder of the week, when they considered\nthat they had nearly enough, and on Tuesday morning they commenced\nbuilding the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29.\n\nReady had cut out and prepared the door-posts and window-frames from\ntimber which he had towed round from the cove.  He now fixed four poles\nin the earth upright at each corner, and then, with the assistance of\nMr Seagrave, notched every log of cocoa-nut wood on both sides, where\nit was to meet with the one crossing it, so that, by laying log upon log\nalternately, they fitted pretty close, and had only to have the chinks\nbetween them filled in with cocoa-nut leaves twisted very tight, and\nforced between them: this was the work of William and Juno when no more\nlogs were ready for carrying; and, by degrees, the house rose up from\nits foundation.  The fireplace could not be made at once, as they had\neither to find clay, or to burn shells into lime and build it up with\nrocks and mortar; but a space was left for it.  For three weeks they\nworked very hard: as soon as the sides were up, they got on the whole of\nthe roof and rafters; and then, with the broad leaves of the cocoa-nut\ntrees which had been cut down, Ready thatched it very strong and\nsecurely.  At the end of the three weeks the house was secure from the\nweather; and it was quite time, for the weather had begun to change, the\nclouds now gathered thick, and the rainy season was commencing.\n\n\"We have no time to lose, sir,\" said Ready to Mr Seagrave.  \"We have\nworked hard, but we must for a few days work harder still.  We must fit\nup the inside of the house, so as to enable Madam to get into it as soon\nas possible.\"\n\nThe earth in the inside of the house was then beaten down hard, so as to\nmake a floor; and a sort of bedstead, about two feet from the ground,\nrunning the whole length of the house, was raised on each side of the\ninterior: these were fitted with canvas screens to let down by night.\nAnd then Ready and William took the last trip in the boat to fetch the\nchairs and tables, which they did just before the coming on of the first\nstorm of the season.  The bedding and all the utensils were now taken\ninto the house; and a little outhouse was built up to cook in, until the\nfireplace could be made.\n\nIt was late on the Saturday night that the family shifted into the new\nhouse; and fortunate it was that they had no further occasion for delay,\nfor on the Sunday the first storm burst upon them; the wind blew with\ngreat force; and, although they were shielded from it, still the\ncocoa-nut trees ground and sawed each other's stems as they bent their\nheads to its force.  The lightning was vivid, and the thunder appalling,\nwhile the rain descended in a continual torrent.  The animals left the\npastures, and sheltered themselves in the grove; and, although noonday,\nit was so dark that they could not see to read.\n\n\"This, then, is the rainy season which you talked about, Ready,\" said\nMrs Seagrave.  \"Is it always like this?  If so, what shall we do?\"\n\n\"No, madam; the sun will shine sometimes, but not for long at a time.\nWe shall be able to get out and do something every now and then almost\nevery day, but still we shall have rain, perhaps, for many days without\nintermission, and we must work indoors.\"\n\n\"How thankful we ought to be that we have a house over our heads; we\nshould have been drowned in the tents.\"\n\n\"That I knew, madam, and therefore I was anxious to get a house over\nyour head; let us thank God for it.\"\n\n\"Indeed we ought,\" observed Mr Seagrave; \"and it is, indeed, time for\nus to read the service.\"\n\nThe morning service was then performed in the new house.  Violent as the\nrain was, it did not penetrate through the thatch which had been put on.\nReady and William went out to secure the boat, which they were afraid\nwould be injured, and returned wet to the skin.  The storm continued\nwithout intermission the whole of the night, but they slept dry and\nsafe; and, when awakened by the noise of the thunder and the pelting of\nthe rain, they thanked God that they had found a dwelling in the\nwilderness upon which they had been cast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30.\n\nWhen they all rose up the next morning, the clouds had cleared off, and\nthe sun was shining bright.  Ready and Juno were the first out of the\nhouse--Ready with the telescope under his arm, which he always took with\nhim when he went his rounds, as he termed it, in the morning.\n\n\"Well, Juno,\" said Ready, \"this is a fine morning after the rain.\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Ready, very fine morning; but how I get fire light, and make\nkittle boil for breakfast, I really don't know--stick and cocoa-nut\ntrash all so wet.\"\n\n\"Before I went to bed last night, Juno, I covered up the embers with\nashes, put some stones over them, and then some cocoa-nut branches, so I\nthink you will find some fire there yet.  I was going my morning's\nround, but I will stay a little and help you.\"\n\n\"Tank you, Massa Ready; plenty rain fell last night.\"\n\n\"Yes, not a little, Juno; you must not expect to find the water at the\nwell very clear this morning; indeed, I doubt if you will see the well\nat all.  Here's some stuff which is not very wet.\"\n\n\"I got plenty of fire, too,\" replied Juno, who had removed the branches\nand stones, and was now on her knees blowing up the embers.\n\n\"You'll do very well now, Juno,\" said Ready; \"besides, William will be\nout directly--so I'll leave you.\"\n\nReady whistled to the dogs, who came bounding out, and then set off on\nhis round of inspection.  He first directed his steps to the well in the\nravine; but, instead of the gushing spring and the limpid clear water,\nwith which the cask sunk for a well had been filled, there was now a\nmuddy torrent, rushing down the ravine, and the well was covered with\nit, and not to be distinguished.\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Ready, musing over the impetuous stream;\n\"well, better too much water than too little.\"  Ready waded through, as\nhe wished to examine the turtle-pond, which was on the other side of the\nstream.  Finding all right, he again crossed the water, where it was now\nspread wide over the sandy beach, until he came to the other point where\nhe had moored his boat, both by the head and stern, with a rope, and a\nheavy stone made fast to it, as an anchor.\n\nFrom this point, as usual, he surveyed the horizon with his telescope;\nnot that he thought that there was a chance of a vessel arriving among\nthese islands; but, still, as it was possible, he took the trouble; but\nnever except when he went out in the morning alone, as he was aware that\nthe very circumstance of his so doing would make Mr Seagrave melancholy\nand unsettled.  As usual, he dropped the telescope on his arm, after his\nsurvey, saying to himself, \"Little use doing that.\"\n\nThe gale having blown offshore, the boat had dragged her moorings, and\nwas so far out that Ready could not get at her.\n\n\"Here's a puzzle,\" said the old man; \"how foolish of me not to have made\na line fast to the shore!  I'll not trust myself to John Shark by\nswimming to the boat.\"\n\n\"Let me see.\"  Ready took the halyards and sheets belonging to the\nboat's sails, which he had left on the beach, and bent one on to the\nother until he had sufficient length of rope.  He then made a piece of\nwood, about two feet long, fast by the middle to the end of the rope,\nand, after one or two attempts, contrived to throw it into the boat.\nThe piece of wood caught under one of the thwarts, and this enabled him\nto draw the boat to the shore.\n\nHaving baled out the water which had fallen into her during the storm,\nhe then landed again and examined the garden.\n\n\"Now to find the sheep and goats,\" said Ready, \"and then my morning's\nwalk is over.  Now, Romulus, now, Remus, boys, find them out,\" continued\nhe; and the dogs, who appeared to know what he was in search of, went\naway in pursuit, and soon found the sheep and two of the goats, but the\nthird goat was not with them.\n\n\"Why, where can Black Nanny be?\" muttered Ready, stopping a little\nwhile; at last he heard a bleat, in a small copse of brushwood, to which\nhe directed his steps, followed by the dogs.  \"I thought as much,\" said\nhe, as he perceived Nanny lying down in the copse with two new-born kids\nat her side.  \"Come, my little fellows, we must find some shelter for\nyou,\" said he, taking one up under each arm.  \"Come, Nanny.\"\n\nReady walked back to the house, and brought in the kids, followed by\nNanny.  He found Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the children all dressed.\nCaroline and Tommy gave a scream of delight when they saw the little\nkids, and even little Albert clapped his hands.  As soon as Ready put\nthem down on the ground, Tommy and Caroline had each their arms round\none.\n\n\"I've brought an addition to our family, Mrs Seagrave,\" said Ready: \"we\nmust allow them to remain in the house until I can knock up a little\nshelter for them.  This is only a beginning; I expect we shall soon have\nmore.\"\n\nAs soon as the children could be persuaded to part with the kids, Nanny\nwas tied up in a corner, and was very content with fondling and nursing\nher progeny.  Juno and William brought in the breakfast, and as soon as\nit was over, Mr Seagrave said, \"Now, Ready, I think we must hold a\ncouncil, and make arrangements as to our allotted duties and employments\nduring the rainy season.  We have a great deal to do, and must not be\nidle.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we have a great deal to do, and, to get through our work, we\nmust have order and method in our doings.  I've lived long enough to\nknow how much can be done by regularity and discipline.  Why, sir, there\nis more work got out of men in a well-conducted man-of-war than there\ncan in the merchant service in double the time.  And why so?  Because\neverything is in its place, and there is a place for everything.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said Mrs Seagrave; \"method is everything.  While\none careless little girl is looking for her thimble, another will have\nfinished her work.\"\n\n\"I assure you I never should have known what can be done by order and\narrangement, if I had not been pressed on board of a man-of-war.  I\nfound that everything was done in silence.  Every man was to his post;\neveryone had a rope to haul upon, or a rope to let go; the boatswain\npiped, and in a few seconds every sail was set or taken in as was\nrequired.  It seemed to me at first like magic.  And you observe, Mr\nSeagrave, that when there is order and discipline, every man becomes of\nindividual importance.  If I learnt nothing else on board of a\nman-of-war, I learnt to make the most of time, and the most of the\nstrength which you could command.\"\n\n\"You are very right, Ready; you must teach us to do the same,\" replied\nMr Seagrave.\n\n\"We have so much to do, that I hardly know where to begin; yet, sir, we\nmust work at present how we can, and when we can, until we have got\nthings into a little better order.  We have done well up to the\npresent.\"\n\n\"What do you think we ought to do first?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, our first job will be to haul up the boat and secure her\nfrom harm; we will half-dock her in the sand, and cover her over, for I\ndo not think it will be safe to go in her now to the other side of the\nisland, where the sea will always be rough.\"\n\n\"There I perfectly agree with you.  Now what is the next?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, we must not leave the tents where they are, but take them\ndown, and as soon as they are dry, stow them away, for we may want them\nby and by; then, sir, we must build a large outhouse for our stores and\nprovisions, with a thatched roof, and a floor raised about four feet\nfrom the ground; and then, under the floor, the sheep and goats will\nhave a protection from the weather.  Then there is the fish-pond to\nmake, and also a salt-pan to cut out of the rock.  Then we have two more\nlong jobs.  One is, to go through the woods and examine the stores we\nhave left on the other side of the island, sort and arrange them all\nready for bringing here after the rains are over; and we must also\nexplore the island a little, and find out what it produces; for at\npresent we know nothing of it: we may find a great many things useful to\nus, a great many trees and fruits, and I hope and trust we may be able\nto find some more grass for our live stock.\"\n\n\"I agree with you in all you say, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"now how\nshall we divide our strength?\"\n\n\"We will not divide at present, sir, if you please.  Juno has plenty to\ndo indoors with Mrs Seagrave; William, and you, and I, will first\nsecure the boat and stow away the tents and gear; after that, we will\nset about the outbuilding, and work at it when we can.  If Juno has any\ntime to spare, she had better collect the cocoa-nut leaves, and pile\nthem up for fuel; and Tommy will, I dare say, go with her, and show her\nhow to draw them along.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll show her,\" said Tommy, getting on his feet.\n\n\"Not just now, Tommy,\" said Ready, \"but as soon as your mamma can spare\nher to go with you.  Come, sir, a few hours of weather like this is not\nto be lost,\" continued Ready; \"we shall have more rain before the day is\nover, I expect.  I will first go to the tent for the shovels; then I\nwill haul the boat round to the beach and meet you there.  You and\nWilliam can take some cord, tie up a large bundle of cocoa-nut boughs,\nsling it to the wheels, and draw it down to the beach and meet me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31.\n\nAs so many cocoa-nut trees had been cut down to build the house, there\nwere plenty of boughs lying in every direction, and William and Mr\nSeagrave had soon procured sufficient.  In a very short time the boat\nwas drawn up about ten yards from the water's edge, which Ready said was\nquite sufficient; they then dug from under with their shovels until the\nboat was sunk about half down in the sand.\n\nHaving filled in the sand all round her up to her gunnel, the boat was\nthen carefully covered over with the boughs, which were weighed down\nwith sand that they might not be blown away.\n\n\"I don't see why you should cover the boat up in this way, Ready; the\nrain won't hurt her,\" observed William.\n\n\"No, sir, the rain won't do her any harm, but the sun will, when it\nbursts out occasionally; for it's very powerful when it does shine, and\nit would split her all to pieces.\"\n\n\"I forgot that,\" replied William.  \"What shall we do now?\"\n\n\"Suppose, as we have two hours to dinner-time, you run for the lines,\nWilliam, and we'll try for some fish.\"\n\n\"We cannot all three of us fish with only two lines,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"No, sir; and as William knows how to catch them, suppose you remain\nwith him, and I will go up and collect wood and chips for Juno's fire.\nShe was hard pressed for it this morning, it was so wet; but, if once\npiled up, it will soon be dry.  Be careful, Mr Seagrave, not to hold\nthe lines tight in your hands, or you may be jerked into the water.\"\n\nMr Seagrave and William were very fortunate; before the two hours were\nexpired they had caught eight large fish, which they brought up to the\nhouse slung on the boat-hook.  Tommy hallooed loudly for fish for\ndinner, and as they had caught so many, it was agreed that the dinner\nshould be put off until some could be got ready, and they were not sorry\nto eat them instead of salt pork.\n\nThey had hardly sat down to table, when the rain came pattering down on\nthe roof, and in a quarter of an hour the storm was as violent, and the\nthunder and lightning as terrific as on the day before.  All outdoor\nlabour was again suspended.  Mrs Seagrave, Juno, and Caroline took\ntheir work, for there was plenty to do with the needle and thread, and\nReady soon found employment for the rest.  William and Mr Seagrave\nunlaid some thick rope, that Ready might make smaller and more useful\nrope with the yarns.  Ready took up his sailing needles, and worked\neyelet-holes in the canvas screens (which they had put up in a hurry),\nso that they might be drawn to and fro as required.\n\nAs soon as Ready had hung up the curtains, he looked under the bedsteads\nfor a large bundle, and said, as he opened it, \"I shall now decorate\nMadam Seagrave's sleeping-place.  It ought to be handsomer than the\nothers.\"  The bundle was composed of the ship's ensign, which was red,\nand a large, square, yellow flag with the name of the ship _Pacific_ in\nlarge black letters upon it.  These two flags Ready festooned and tied\nup round the bed-place, so as to give it a very gay appearance, and also\nto hide the rough walls of the cottage.\n\n\"Indeed, Ready, I am much obliged to you,\" said Mrs Seagrave, when he\nhad finished; \"it is really quite grand for this place.\"\n\n\"It's the best use we can put them to now, madam,\" said Ready.\n\n\"I am afraid so,\" replied Mr Seagrave, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Ready,\" said William, after the candles were lighted, \"you once\nhalf-promised me that you would tell me your history; I wish you would\ntell us some of it now, as it will pass away the evening.\"\n\n\"Well, William, I did say so, and I shall keep my word.  When you have\nheard my story, you will say that I have been very foolish in my time;\nand so I have; but if it proves a warning to you, it will, at all\nevents, be of some use.\"\n\nReady then commenced his history as follows:\n\nHISTORY OF OLD READY.\n\n\"Of course, you wish to know who my father and mother were: that is soon\ntold.  My father was the captain of a merchant vessel, which traded from\nSouth Shields to Hamburg, and my poor mother, God bless her, was the\ndaughter of a half-pay militia captain, who died about two months after\ntheir marriage.  The property which the old gentleman had bequeathed to\nmy mother was added to that which my father had already vested in the\nbrig, and he then owned one-third of the vessel; the other two-thirds\nwere the property of a very rich ship-builder and owner, of the name of\nMasterman.  What with the profits of the share he held of the vessel and\nhis pay as captain, my father was well to do.  Mr Masterman, who had a\nvery high opinion of my father, and gained much money by his exertions\nand good management, was present at the marriage, and when I was born,\nabout a year afterwards, he stood for me as godfather.  Every one\nconsidered that this was a most advantageous circumstance for me, and\ncongratulated my father and mother; for Mr Masterman was a bachelor, of\nnearly sixty years, without any near relations.  It is true, that he was\nvery fond of money; but that, they said, was all the better, as he could\nnot take it away with him when he died.  An end, however, was soon put\nto all their worldly ideas, for a year after I was born, my father was\ndrowned at sea, his vessel and the whole of her crew being lost on the\nTexel sands; and my mother found herself a widow, with a child scarcely\nweaned, when she was but twenty-two years of age.\n\n\"It was supposed that my mother would still have sufficient to live\nupon, as the ship had been insured at two-thirds of her value; but, to\nthe astonishment of everybody, Mr Masterman contrived to make it appear\nthat it was his two-thirds of the vessel which had been insured.\"\n\n\"What is insurance?\" inquired William.\n\n\"Insurance, my dear boy, is paying a certain sum to people who are\ncalled underwriters, that in case the vessel or cargo is lost or\ndamaged, the loss or damage is made good to the owners of the vessel or\ncargo.  You pay in proportion to the risk incurred.  Supposing you\nwished to insure one thousand pounds on a vessel or cargo, and ten per\ncent was required, you would, if the vessel came home safe, pay the\nunderwriters one hundred pounds; if, on the contrary, the vessel was\nlost, the underwriters would have to pay you one thousand pounds, the\nsum which you had insured.  I beg your pardon for the interruption,\nReady.\"\n\n\"No need, Mr Seagrave; we never should lose an opportunity of teaching\nthe young.  Well, how far the assertion of Mr Masterman was correct or\nnot, it was impossible at the time to say; but I do know that everybody\ncried out `shame', and that if he did deprive the widow, he had much to\nanswer for; for the Bible says, `Pure religion is to visit the\nfatherless and the widows in their affliction, and to keep yourself\nunspotted in the world'.  The consequence was, that my mother had little\nor nothing to live upon; but she found friends who assisted her, and she\nworked embroidery, and contrived to get on somehow until I was eight or\nnine years of age.\"\n\n\"But did not your godfather come forward to the assistance of your\nmother?\" inquired Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"No, sir, strange to say, he did not; and that made people talk the\nmore.  I believe it was the abuse of him, which he did not fail to hear,\nand which he ascribed to my mother, which turned him away from us;\nperhaps it was his own conscience, for we always dislike those we have\ninjured.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is great truth in that remark of yours, Ready,\"\nobserved Mr Seagrave; \"still, it is strange that he did not do\nsomething.\"\n\n\"It was very strange, sir,--at least, so it appeared at the time, but he\nwas very fond of money, and irritated at the reports and observations\nwhich were made about him.  But, to go on, sir, I was a strong, hardy\nboy, and, whenever I could escape from my mother or school, was always\nfound by the water-side or on board of the vessels.  In the summer-time\nI was half the day in water, and was a very good swimmer.  My mother\nperceived my fondness for the profession, and tried all she could to\ndivert my thoughts some other way.  She told me of the dangers and\nhardships which sailors went through, and always ended with my father's\ndeath and a flood of tears.\n\n\"We certainly are of a perverse nature, as I have often heard the\nclergyman say, for it appears to me that we always wish to do that which\nwe are told not to do.  If my mother had not been always persuading me\nagainst going to sea, I really believe I might have stayed at home.\nI've often thought since, how selfish and unfeeling I must have been.  I\nwas too young to know what pain I was giving my mother, and how anxiety\nwas preying upon her, all on my account.  Children cannot feel it; if\nthey did, they would do otherwise, for our hearts are seldom hard until\nwe grow older.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave.  \"If children really knew\nhow much their parents suffer when they behave ill, how alarmed they are\nat any proofs of wickedness in them, they would be much better.\"\n\n\"We never find that out, sir, till it is too late,\" continued Ready.\n\"Well, sir, I was little more than nine years old, when, on a very windy\nday, and the water rough, a hawser, by which a vessel was fast to the\nwharf, was carried away with a violent jerk, and the broken part, as it\nflew out, struck a person who was at the edge of the wharf, and knocked\nhim into the sea.  I heard the crying out, and the men from the wharf\nand from the ships were throwing ropes to him, but he could not catch\nhold of them; indeed, he could not swim well, and the water was rough.\nI caught a rope that had been hauled in again, and leapt off the wharf.\n\n\"Young as I was, I swam like a duck, and put the rope into his hands\njust as he was going down.  He clung to it as drowning men only can\ncling, and was hauled to the piles, and soon afterwards a boat, which\nhad been lowered from the stern of one of the vessels, picked us both\nup.  We were taken to a public-house, and put into bed till dry clothes\ncould be sent for us; and then I found that the person I had saved was\nmy godfather, Mr Masterman.  Everyone was loud in my praise; and,\nalthough perhaps I ought not to say it, it was a bold act for so young a\nboy as I was.  The sailors took me home to my mother in a sort of\ntriumphal procession; and she, poor thing, when she heard what I had\ndone, embraced me over and over again, one moment rejoicing at my\npreservation, and the next weeping bitterly at the thoughts of the\ndanger I had encountered, and the probability that my bold spirit would\nlead me into still greater.\"\n\n\"But she did not blame you for what you had done?\"\n\n\"Oh no, William; she felt that I had done my duty towards my neighbour,\nand perhaps she felt in her own heart that I had returned good for evil;\nbut she did not say so.  The next day Mr Masterman called upon us; he\ncertainly looked very foolish and confused when he asked for his godson,\nwhom he had so long neglected.  My mother, who felt how useful he might\nbe to me, received him very kindly; but I had been often told of his\nneglect of me and my mother, and of his supposed unfair conduct towards\nmy father, and had taken a violent dislike to him; his advances towards\nme were therefore very coolly received.  I felt glad that I had saved\nhim; but although I could not exactly understand my own feelings at the\ntime, I am ashamed to say that my pleasure was not derived from having\ndone a good action, so much as indulging a feeling of revenge in having\nput one under an obligation who had treated me ill; this arose from my\nproud spirit, which my mother could not check.  So you see, William,\nthere was very little merit in what I had done, as, after I had done it,\nI indulged those feelings which I ought to have checked.\"\n\n\"I think I could not have helped feeling the same, Ready, under such\ncircumstances,\" replied William.\n\n\"The impulse which induced me to act was good,\" replied Ready; \"but the\nfeeling which I indulged in afterwards took away the whole merit of the\ndeed.  I am stating what I believe to be the truth; and an old man like\nme can look upon the past without bias, but not without regret.  Mr\nMasterman made but a short visit; he told my mother that he would now\ntake care of me and bring me up to the business of a ship-builder as\nsoon as I was old enough to leave school, and that in the meantime he\nwould pay all my expenses.  My poor mother was very grateful, and shed\ntears of joy; and when Mr Masterman went away, she embraced me, and\nsaid that now she was happy, as I should have a profession on shore and\nnot go to sea.  I must do justice to Mr Masterman; he kept his word and\nsent money to my mother, so that she became quite cheerful and\ncomfortable, and everyone congratulated her, and she used to fondle me,\nand say, it was all through me that she was relieved from her distress.\"\n\n\"How happy that must have made you, Ready!\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, it did, but it made me also very proud.  Strange to say, I could\nnot conquer my dislike to Mr Masterman; I had nourished the feeling too\nlong.  I could not bear that my mother should be under obligations to\nhim, or that he should pay for my schooling; it hurt my foolish pride,\nyoung as I then was; and although my mother was happy, I was not.\nBesides, as I was put to a better school, and was obliged to remain with\nthe other boys, I could no longer run about the wharfs, or go on board\nthe vessels, as before.  I did not see then, as I do now, that it was\nall for my good but I became discontented and unhappy, merely because I\nwas obliged to pay attention to my learning, and could no longer have my\nown way.  The master complained of me; and Mr Masterman called and\nscolded me well.  I became more disobedient, and then I was punished.\nThis irritated me, and I made up my mind that I would run away to sea.\nYou see, William, I was all in the wrong; and so will all boys be who\nthink they know better than those who have charge of them; and now only\nsee what I probably lost by my foolish conduct.  I say _probably_, for\nno one can calculate or foresee what is to take place; but, as far as\nappearances went, I had every prospect of receiving a good education--of\nsucceeding Mr Masterman in his business, and, very probably, of\ninheriting his large fortune; so that I might have been at this time a\nrich and well-educated man, surrounded with all the comforts and\nluxuries of life; perhaps with an amiable wife and large family round\nme, to make me still happier, instead of being what I now am, a poor,\nworn-out old seaman upon a desert isle.  I point this out to you,\nWilliam, to show how one false and foolish step in the young may affect\ntheir whole prospects in life; and, instead of enabling them to sail\ndown with the stream of prosperity, may leave them to struggle against\nthe current of adversity, as has been the case with me.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, a good lesson, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"It is; not that I repine at my lot, even while I regret the errors that\nled to it.  An all-wise and gracious God disposes of us as he thinks\nbest; and I can now say with perfect sincerity, `Thy will, not mine, be\ndone'.\"\n\n\"Your misfortunes have, however, proved an incalculable benefit to us,\nReady,\" observed Mrs Seagrave; \"for had you not gone to sea, and been\non board the ship when the crew deserted us, what would have become of\nus?\"\n\n\"Well, madam, it is some comfort to think that a worn-out old seaman\nlike myself has been of some use.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32.\n\nThe bleating of the kids woke them the next morning earlier than usual.\nThe weather was again fine, and the sun shining brightly, and Ready\nturned out Nanny and her progeny.  They had an excellent breakfast of\nfried fish, and then Mr Seagrave, Ready, and William went out to their\nwork: the two first took down the tents, and spread the canvas on the\nground, that it might be well dried, while William went in pursuit of\nthe fowls, which had not been seen for a day or two.  After\nhalf-an-hour's search in the cocoa-nut grove, he heard the cock crow,\nand soon afterwards found them all.  He threw them some split peas,\nwhich he had brought with him.  They were hungry enough and followed him\nhome to the house, where he left them and went to join Ready and his\nfather.\n\n\"William,\" said Ready, \"I think, now that we have spread out the tents,\nwe will, if Mr Seagrave approves, all set to at once and knock up a\nfowl-house; it won't be more than a day's job, and then the creatures\nwill have a home.  There are four very thick cocoa-nut trees close to\nthe house; we will build it under them; it will be a good job over.\"\nMr Seagrave assented, and they set immediately to work.  There were\nmany thin poles left, the tops of the cocoa-nut trees which had been cut\ndown to build the house; these they nailed to the trunks of the four\ntrees, so as to make a square, and then they ran up rafters for a\npitched roof.\n\n\"Now, sir, this is only rough work; we will first put up a perch or two\nfor them, and then close in the side, and thatch the roof with cocoa-nut\nbranches; but there's Juno taking in the dinner, so we'll finish it\nafterwards.\"\n\nAfter their meal the work was renewed; Mr Seagrave collected the\nbranches while William and Ready worked upon the sides and roof, and\nbefore the evening closed in, the fowl-house was complete.  William\nenticed the fowls down to it with some more split peas, and then walked\naway.\n\n\"Now, sir, the creatures will soon find their way in; and by and by,\nwhen I have time, I'll make a door to the entrance.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said William, \"I think we had better roll up the canvas of\nthe tents; we have had a splendid day, and may not be so fortunate\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Very true; we will get them housed, and stow them away under the\nbed-places; there is plenty of room.\"  By the time that they had folded\nup the canvas, and William had brought in Nanny and the kids, the sun\nhad set, and they went into the house.  Ready was requested to go on\nwith his history, which he did as follows:--\n\n\"I said last night that I determined to run away from school and go to\nsea, but I did not tell you how I managed it.  I had no chance of\ngetting out of the school unperceived, except after the boys were all\nput to bed.  The room that I slept in was at the top of the house--the\ndoors I knew were all locked; but there was a trap-door which led out on\nthe roof, fastened by a bolt inside, and a ladder leading up to it; and\nI determined that I would make my escape by that way.  As soon as all\nthe other boys were fast asleep, I arose and dressed myself very\nquietly, and then left the room.\n\n\"The moon shone bright, which was lucky for me, and I gained the\ntrap-door without any noise.  I had some difficulty in forcing it up, as\nit was heavy for a boy of my age; but I contrived to do so at last, and\ngained the roof of the house.  I then began looking about me, to see how\nI was to get to the ground, and after walking to and fro several times,\nI decided that I could slip down by a large water-pipe; it was so far\ndetached from the bricks, that I could get my small fingers round it.  I\nclimbed over the parapet, and, clinging to the pipe firmly with my hands\nand knees, I slid down, and arrived at the bottom in safety.\"\n\n\"It's a wonder you did not break your neck, Ready,\" observed Mrs\nSeagrave.\n\n\"It was, indeed, ma'am.  As soon as I was landed in the flowerbed, which\nwas below, I hastened to the iron gates at the entrance, and soon\nclimbed up and got to the other side into the road.  I started as fast\nas I could towards the port, and when I arrived at the wharf, I\nperceived that a vessel had her topsails loose, and meant to take\nadvantage of the ebb-tide which had just made; the men were singing `Yo\nheave yo,' getting the anchor up; and as I stood watching, almost making\nup my mind that I would swim off to her, I perceived that a man pushed\noff in her jolly-boat, and was sculling to a post a little higher up,\nwhere a hawser had been made fast; I ran round, and arrived there before\nhe had cast off the rope; without saying a word, I jumped into the boat.\n\n\"`What do you want, youngster?' said the seaman.\n\n\"`I want to go to sea,' said I, breathless; `take me on board--pray do.'\n\n\"`Well,' said he, `I heard the captain say he wanted an apprentice, and\nso you may come.'\n\n\"He sculled the boat back again to the vessel, and I climbed up her\nside.\n\n\"`Who are you?' said the captain.\n\n\"I told him that I wanted to go to sea.\n\n\"`You are too little and too young.'\n\n\"`No, I am not,' replied I.\n\n\"`Why, do you think that you dare go aloft?'\n\n\"`I'll show you,' replied I; and I ran up the rigging like a cat, and\nwent out at the topgallant yard-arm.\n\n\"When I came down, the captain said, `Well, I think you'll make a sharp\nseaman by and by; so I'll take you, and, as soon as I get to London,\nI'll bind you apprentice.'\n\n\"The ship, which was a collier, was soon out of port, and before the day\nhad dawned I found myself on the wide ocean, which was hereafter to be\nmy home.\n\n\"As soon as the hurry and confusion were over, I was examined by the\ncaptain, who appeared to me to be a very rough, harsh man; indeed,\nbefore the day was over I almost repented of the step which I had taken,\nand when I sat down cold and wet upon some old sail at night, the\nthoughts of my mother, and what distress I should occasion her, for the\nfirst time rushed into my mind, and I wept bitterly; but it was too late\nthen.  I have often thought, Mr Seagrave, that the life of hardship\nwhich I have since gone through has been a judgment on me for my cruelty\nto my mother, in leaving her the way I did.  It broke her heart; a poor\nreturn, William, for all her care and kindness!  God forgive me!\"\n\nOld Ready left off for some little time, and the remainder of the party\nkept silence.  Then he said--\"I'll leave off now, if you please: I don't\nfeel inclined to go on; my heart is full when I recall that foolish and\nwicked deed of mine.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33.\n\nThe next morning was fine, and as soon as breakfast was over, they took\nthe wheels down to the turtle-pond, and Ready having speared one of the\nlargest by means of a pike with a barb to it, which he had made on\npurpose, they hauled it on shore, slung it under the wheels, and took it\nup to the house.  Having killed the turtle, and cut it up, Juno, under\nthe directions of Ready, chose such portions as were required for the\nsoup; and when the pot was on the fire, Ready, Mr Seagrave, and William\nset off with the cross-cut saw and hatchets, to commence felling the\ncocoa-nut trees for the building of the outhouse, which was to hold\ntheir stores, as soon as they could be brought round from the other side\nof the island.\n\n\"I mean this to be our place of refuge in case of danger, sir,\" observed\nReady; \"and therefore I have selected this thick part of the wood, as it\nis not very far from the house, and by cutting the path to it in a\nzigzag, it will be quite hidden from sight; and we must make the path\njust wide enough to allow the wheels to pass, and stump up the roots of\nthe trees which we are obliged to cut down, otherwise the stumps would\nattract attention.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"there is no saying\nwhat may happen.\"\n\n\"You see, sir, it is often the custom for the natives, in this part of\nthe world, to come in their canoes from one island to another, merely to\nget cocoa-nuts.  I can't say that the other islands near us are\ninhabited, but still it is probable, and we cannot tell what the\ncharacter of the people may be.  I tell you this, but we had better not\nsay a word to Mrs Seagrave, as it may distress her.\"\n\nMr Seagrave agreed, and Ready continued:\n\n\"We are now near the spot, sir.  You see, when we have got over this\nhill, where the trees are so very thick, the fall in the ground will\nassist in the concealment of the building.  I should say we are very\nnear right where we now stand.\"\n\n\"How far are we now from the house?  We must not be too distant.\"\n\n\"I reckon we are not 150 yards in a straight line, although the road\nwill, by its turning, make it double the distance.\"\n\n\"Then I think this spot will do very well.\"\n\n\"I'll just mark out the trees which are to stand, Mr Seagrave, and\nthose which are to be cut down, so as to leave about four feet of stump\nstanding.\"\n\nAs soon as they had planned the building, the axes and saw were in full\nuse, and tree after tree fell one upon the other.  They worked hard till\ndinner-time, and were not sorry at the prospect of sitting down to a\nrich mess of turtle-soup.\n\n\"My dear William, and you too, Mr Seagrave, how very warm you are!\"\nsaid Mrs Seagrave; \"you must not work so hard.\"\n\n\"Cutting down trees is very warm work, mother,\" replied William, \"and\nhard work will never hurt any one, especially when he dines off\nturtle-soup.  Why, Tommy, what's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"Tommy and I are at variance,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.  \"I had my thimble\nthis morning, and had commenced my sewing, when I was called out by\nJuno, and Caroline went with me, and Tommy was left in the house.  When\nI came back I found him outside, and on going back to my work, there was\nno thimble to be found; I asked him if he had touched it, and his answer\nwas that he would look for it.  He did look, and said he could not find\nit; I have asked him several times if he took it away, and his only\nanswer is that he will find it by and by.\"\n\n\"Tommy, did you take the thimble?\" said Mr Seagrave, gravely.\n\n\"I'll find it by and by, papa.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer.  Did you take the thimble?\"\n\n\"I'll find it by and by, papa,\" said Tommy, whimpering.\n\n\"That's all the answer he will give me,\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Well, then, he shall have no dinner till the thimble makes its\nappearance,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\nMaster Tommy began to cry at this intelligence.  Juno appeared with the\nturtle-soup; and Tommy cried louder when they had said grace and\ncommenced their dinner.  They were all very hungry, and William sent his\nplate for another portion, which he had not commenced long before he put\nhis finger in his mouth and pulled out something.\n\n\"Why, mother, here's the thimble in my soup,\" cried William.\n\n\"No wonder he said he would find it by and by,\" said Ready, smiling; \"he\nmeant to have fished it up, I suppose, from what was left of the soup\nafter dinner.  Well, Mrs Seagrave, I don't mean to say that Tommy is a\ngood boy, but still, although he would not tell where the thimble was,\nhe has not told a falsehood about it.\"\n\n\"No, he has not,\" replied William.  \"I think, now that the thimble is\nfound, if he begs pardon, papa will forgive him.\"\n\n\"Tommy, come here,\" said Mr Seagrave.  \"Tell me why you put that\nthimble into the soup?\"\n\n\"I wanted to taste the soup.  I wanted to fill the thimble; the soup\nburnt my fingers, and I let the thimble drop in.\"\n\n\"Well, a thimbleful wasn't much, at all events,\" observed Ready.  \"And\nwhy didn't you tell your mamma where the thimble was?\"\n\n\"I was afraid mamma throw all the soup away, and then I get none for\ndinner.\"\n\n\"Oh! that was it, was it?  Well, sir, I said you should have no dinner\ntill the thimble was found, so, as it is found, you may have your\ndinner; but if you ever refuse to answer a question again, I shall\npunish you more severely.\"\n\nTommy was glad the lecture was over, and more glad to get his\nturtle-soup; he finished one plate, and, as he asked for another, he\nsaid, \"Tommy won't put thimble in again; put tin pot in next time.\"\n\nAfter dinner they went to their work again, and did not come in again\ntill sunset.\n\n\"The clouds are gathering fast, sir,\" observed Ready; \"we shall have\nrain to-night.\"\n\n\"I fear we shall; but we must expect it now, Ready.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and by and by we shall have it for days together.\"\n\n\"Ready,\" said Mrs Seagrave, \"if you are not too tired, perhaps you will\ngo on with your history.\"\n\n\"Certainly, ma'am, if you wish it,\" replied Ready.  \"When I left off, I\nwas on board of the collier, bound to London.  We had a very fair wind,\nand a quick passage.  I was very sick until we arrived in the Nore, and\nthen I recovered, and, as you may suppose, was astonished at the busy\nscene, and the quantity of vessels which were going up and down the\nriver.  But I did not like my captain; he was very severe and brutal to\nthe men; and the apprentice who was on board told me to run away, and\nget into another vessel, and not to bind myself apprentice to this\ncaptain, or I should be beat all day long, and be treated as bad as he\nwas.  I knew this was the case, as the captain kicked and cuffed him\ntwenty times a day.  The men said that he did not do so to me, for fear\nI should refuse to be his apprentice; but that, as soon as my indentures\nwere signed, he would treat me in the same way.\n\n\"Well, I made up my mind that I would not remain in the collier; and, as\nthe captain had gone on shore, I had plenty of time to look about me.\nThere was a large ship, which was ready to sail, lying in the stream; I\nspoke to two boys who were at the stairs in her boat, and they told me\nthat they were very comfortable on board, and that the captain wanted\ntwo or three apprentices.  I went on board with them, and offered\nmyself.  The captain asked me a great many questions, and I told him the\ntruth, and why I did not like to remain in the collier.  He agreed to\ntake me; and I went on shore with him, signed my indentures, and\nreceived from him a sufficient supply of clothes; and, two days\nafterwards, we sailed for Bombay and China.\"\n\n\"But you wrote to your mother, Ready, did you not?\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, I did; for the captain desired me to do so, and he put a few lines\nat the bottom to comfort her; but, unfortunately, the letter, which was\nsent on shore by the cook, never arrived.  Whether he dropped it, or\nforgot it till after the ship sailed, and then tore it up, I do not\nknow; but, as I found out afterwards, it never did get to her hands.\"\n\n\"It was not your fault that the letter did not arrive safe,\" said Mrs\nSeagrave.\n\n\"No, madam, that was not my fault; the fault had been committed before.\"\n\n\"Don't dwell any more upon that portion of your history, Ready; but tell\nus what took place after you sailed for the East Indies.\"\n\n\"Be it so, if you please.  I certainly was very smart and active for my\nage, and soon became a great favourite on board, especially with the\nlady passengers, because I was such a little fellow.  We arrived safely\nat Bombay, where our passengers went on shore, and in three weeks\nafterwards we sailed down the straits for China.  It was war time, and\nwe were very often chased by French privateers; but as we had a good\ncrew and plenty of guns, none of them ventured to attack us, and we got\nsafe to Macao, where we unloaded our cargo and took in teas.  We had to\nwait some time for a convoy, and then sailed for England.  When we were\noff the Isle of France, the convoy was dispersed in a gale; and three\ndays afterwards, a French frigate bore down upon us, and after\nexchanging a few broadsides, we were compelled to haul down our colours.\nA lieutenant was sent on board with forty men to take charge of us, for\nwe were a very rich prize to them.  The captain and most of the crew\nwere taken on board of the frigate, but ten Lascars and the boys were\nleft in the Indiaman, to assist in taking her into the Isle of France,\nwhich was at that time in the hands of the French.  I thought it hard\nthat I was to go to prison at twelve years old; but I did not care much\nabout it, and very soon I was as gay and merry as ever.  We had made the\nisland, and were on a wind beating up to the port, when a vessel was\nseen to windward, and although I could not understand what the Frenchmen\nsaid, I perceived that they were in a great fluster and very busy with\ntheir spy-glasses, and Jack Romer, one of my brother 'prentices who had\nbeen three years at sea, said to me, `I don't think we'll go to prison\nafter all, Ready, for that vessel is an English man-of-war, if I'm not\nmistaken.'  At last she came down within three miles of us, and hoisted\nEnglish colours and fired a gun.  The Frenchmen put the ship before the\nwind, but it was of no use; the man-of-war came up with us very fast,\nand then the Frenchmen began to pack up their clothes, together with all\nthe other things which they had collected out of the property of our\ncaptain and crew; a shot was fired which went clean over our heads, and\nthen they left the helm, and Jack Romer went to it, and, with my help,\nhove the ship up in the wind; a boat came on board and took possession,\nand so there was one escape, at all events.\n\n\"They sent a midshipman as prize-master on board of the vessel, and left\nall us, who had been taken prisoners by the French, in the vessel, to\nhelp to work her into port, as the captain did not wish to part with any\nmore men of his own than was necessary.  We soon made sail for England,\nquite delighted at having escaped a French prison, but, after all, we\nonly exchanged it for a Dutch one.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that, two days afterwards, as we were rounding the Cape, another\nFrench vessel bore down upon us, and captured us.  This time we did not\nfind any friend in need, and were taken into Table Bay; for at that time\nthe Cape of Good Hope was in the possession of the Dutch, who, as well\nas the French, were at war with England.\"\n\n\"How very unfortunate you were, Ready!\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes, madam, we were, and I can't say much in favour of a Dutch prison.\nHowever, I was very young at that time, and did not care much--I had a\nlight heart.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34.\n\nA heavy storm came on soon after they had retired to rest; the lightning\nwas so vivid that its flashes penetrated through the chinks of the door\nand windows, and the thunder burst upon them with a noise which\nprevented them obtaining any sleep.  The children cried and trembled as\nthey lay in the arms of Mrs Seagrave and Juno, who were almost as much\nalarmed themselves.\n\n\"This is very awful,\" said Mr Seagrave to Ready, for they had both\nrisen from their beds.\n\n\"It is indeed, sir; I never knew a more terrible storm than this.\"\n\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" exclaimed Mr Seagrave.\n\nAs he spoke, they were both thrown back half-stunned; a crash of thunder\nburst over the house, which shook everything in it; a sulphurous smell\npervaded the building, and soon afterwards, when they recovered their\nfeet, they perceived that the house was full of smoke, and they heard\nthe wailing of the women and the shrieks of the children in the\nbed-places on the other side.\n\n\"God have mercy on us!\" exclaimed Ready, who was the first to recover\nhimself, and who now attempted to ascertain the injury which had been\ndone: \"the lightning has struck us, and I fear that the house is on fire\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"My wife--my children!\" exclaimed Mr Seagrave; \"are they all safe?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried Mrs Seagrave, \"all safe; Tommy has come to me; but\nwhere is Juno?  Juno!\"\n\nJuno answered not.  William darted to the other side of the house, and\nfound Juno lying on her side, motionless.\n\n\"She is dead, father,\" cried William.\n\n\"Help me to carry her out of the house, Mr Seagrave,\" said Ready, who\nhad lifted up the poor girl; \"she may be only stunned.\"\n\nThey carried Juno out of the house, and laid her on the ground; the rain\npoured down in torrents.\n\nReady left them for a minute, to ascertain if the house was on fire; he\nfound that it had been in flames at the further corner, but the rain had\nextinguished it.  He then went back to Mr Seagrave and William, who\nwere with Juno.\n\n\"I will attend to the girl, sir,\" said Ready; \"go you and Master William\ninto the house; Mrs Seagrave will be too much frightened if she is left\nalone at such an awful time.  See, sir!  Juno is not dead--her chest\nheaves--she will come to very soon; thank God for it!\"\n\nWilliam and Mr Seagrave returned to the house; they found Mrs Seagrave\nfainting with anxiety and fear.  The information they brought, that Juno\nwas not killed by the lightning, did much to restore her.  William\nsoothed little Albert, and Tommy in a few minutes was fast asleep again\nin his father's arms.  The storm now abated, and as the day began to\nbreak, Ready appeared with Juno, who was sufficiently recovered to be\nable to walk in with his support; she was put into her bed, and then\nReady and Mr Seagrave went to examine if further mischief had been\ndone.  The lightning had come in at the further end of the house, at the\npart where the fireplace was intended to have been made.\n\n\"We have been most mercifully preserved,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes, sir, thanks be to God for all his goodness,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"I think we have a large roll of copper wire, Ready; have we not?\" said\nMr Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was just thinking of it myself; we will have a\nlightning-conductor up the first thing.\"\n\nIt was now broad daylight.  Mrs Seagrave dressed herself and the\nchildren, and as soon as she was ready, Mr Seagrave read such portions\nof the Psalms as were appropriate, and they earnestly joined in a prayer\nof thankfulness and humility.  William went out to prepare the\nbreakfast, and Ready procured the coil of copper wire from those stores\nwhich were stowed under the bed-places.  This he unrolled, and stretched\nit out straight, and then went for the ladder, which was at the outhouse\nthey had commenced building.  As soon as breakfast was over, Ready and\nMr Seagrave went out again to fix up the lightning-conductor, leaving\nWilliam to do the work of Juno, who still remained fast asleep in her\nbed.\n\n\"I think,\" said Ready, \"that one of those two trees which are close\ntogether will suit the best; they are not too near the house, and yet\nquite near enough for the wire to attract the lightning.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Ready; but we must not leave both standing.\"\n\n\"No, sir, but we shall require them both to get up and fix the wire;\nafter that we will cut down the other.\"\n\nReady put his ladder against one of the trees, and, taking with him the\nhammer and a bag of large spike-nails, drove one of the nails into the\ntrunk of the tree till it was deep enough in to bear his weight; he then\ndrove in another above it, and so he continued to do, standing upon one\nof them while he drove in another above, till he had reached the top of\nthe tree, close to the boughs; he then descended, and, leaving the\nhammer behind him, took up a saw and small axe, and in about ten minutes\nhe had cut off the head of the cocoa-nut tree, which remained a tall,\nbare pole.\n\n\"Take care, Ready, how you come down,\" said Mr Seagrave anxiously.\n\n\"Never fear, sir,\" replied Ready; \"I'm not so young as I was, but I have\nbeen too often at the mast-head, much higher than this.\"\n\nReady came down again, and then cut down a small pole, to fix with a\nthick piece of pointed wire at the top of it, on the head of the\ncocoa-nut tree.  He then went up, lashed the small pole to the head of\nthe tree, made the end of the copper wire fast to the pointed wire, and\nthen he descended.  The other tree near to it was then cut down, and the\nlower end of the wire buried in the ground at the bottom of the tree on\nwhich the lightning-conductor had been fixed.\n\n\"That's a good job done, sir,\" said Ready, wiping his face, for he was\nwarm with the work.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"and we must put up another near the\nouthouse, or we may lose our stores.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir.\"\n\n\"You understand this, William, don't you?\" said his father.\n\n\"O yes, papa; lightning is attracted by metal, and will now strike the\npoint instead of the house, run down the wire, and only tear up the\nground below.\"\n\n\"It's coming on again, sir, as thick as ever,\" observed the old man; \"we\nshall do no work to-day, I'm afraid.  I'll just go and see where the\nstock are.\"\n\nJuno was now up again, and said that she was quite well, with the\nexception of a headache.  As Ready had predicted, the rain now came on\nagain with great violence, and it was impossible to do any work out of\ndoors.  At the request of William he continued his narrative.\n\nNARRATIVE OF OLD READY.\n\n\"Well, William, as soon as they had let go their anchor in Table Bay, we\nwere all ordered on shore, and sent up to a prison close to the\nGovernment Gardens.  We were not very carefully watched, as it appeared\nimpossible for us to get away, and I must say we were well treated in\nevery respect; but we were told that we should be sent to Holland in the\nfirst man-of-war which came into the bay, and we did not much like the\nidea.\n\n\"There were, as I told you, some other boys as well as myself, who\nbelonged to the Indiaman, and we kept very much together, not only\nbecause we were more of an age, but because we had been shipmates so\nlong.  Two of these boys, one of whom I have mentioned as Jack Romer,\nand the other Will Hastings, were my particular friends; and one day, as\nwe were sitting under the wall warming ourselves, for it was winter\ntime, Romer said, `How very easy it would be for us to get away, if we\nonly knew where to go to!'\n\n\"`Yes,' replied Hastings; `but where are we to go to, if it is not to\nthe Hottentots and wild savages; and when we get there, what can we\ndo?--we can't get any further.'  `Well,' said I, `I would rather be\nliving free among savages, than be shut up in a prison.'  That was our\nfirst talk on the subject, but we had many others afterwards; and as the\none or two Dutch soldiers who stood sentry spoke English, and we could\ntalk a little Dutch, we obtained a good deal of information from them;\nfor they had very often been sent to the frontiers of the colony.  We\ncontinued to ask questions, and to talk among ourselves for about two\nmonths, and at last we resolved that we would make our escape.  We\nshould have done much better if we had remained where we were; but there\nis no putting old heads upon young shoulders.  We saved up our\nprovisions, bought some long Dutch knives, tied our few clothes up in\nbundles, and one dark night we contrived to remain in the yard without\nbeing perceived, when the prisoners were locked up; and raising a long\npole, which lay in the yard, to the top of the wall, with a good deal of\nscrambling we contrived to get over it, and made off as fast as we could\nfor the Table Mountain.\"\n\n\"What was your reason for going there, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, Hastings, who was the oldest, and, I will say, the sharpest of the\nthree, said that we had better stay up there for a few days, till we had\nmade up our minds what to do, and try if we could not procure a musket\nor two, and ammunition; for, you see, we had money, as, when the\nIndiaman was first taken, the captain divided a keg of rupees, which was\non board, among the officers and men, in proportion to the wages due to\nthem, thinking it was better for the crew to have the money than to\nleave it for the Frenchmen; and we had spent very little while in\nprison.  There was also another reason why he persuaded us to go to the\nTable Mountain, which was, that as soon as our escape was found out,\nthey would send parties to look for us; thinking, of course, that we had\nmade for the interior; and we should have less chance of being retaken\nif we travelled after the first search was over.  The soldiers had told\nus of the lions, and other wild animals, and how dangerous it was to\ntravel, and Hastings said, that not finding us, they would suppose we\nhad been destroyed by the wild beasts, and would not look for us any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Foolish indeed,\" observed Mrs Seagrave, \"to set off you knew not\nwhere, in a country full of wild beasts and savages.\"\n\n\"True enough, madam,\" replied Ready.  \"We ran at first until we were out\nof breath, and then we walked on as fast as we could--not going right up\nthe mountain, but keeping a slanting direction to the south-west, so as\nto get away from the town, and more towards False Bay.\n\n\"We had walked about four hours, and began to feel very tired, when the\nday dawned, and then we looked out for a place to conceal ourselves in.\nWe soon found a cave with a narrow entrance, large enough inside to hold\nhalf-a-dozen of such lads as we were, and we crawled in.  It was quite\ndry, and, as we were very tired, we lay down with our heads on our\nbundles, intending to take a nap; but we had hardly made ourselves\ncomfortable and shut our eyes, when we heard such a screaming and\nbarking that we were frightened out of our lives almost.  We could not\nthink what it could be.  At last Hastings peeped out, and began to\nlaugh; so Romer and I looked out also, and there we saw about one\nhundred and fifty large baboons leaping and tumbling about in such a way\nas I never saw; they were bigger than we were--indeed, when they stood\non their hind legs they were much taller, and they had very large white\ntusks.  Some of them were females, with young ones on their backs, and\nthey were just as active as the males.  At last they played such antics,\nthat we all burst out into a loud laugh, and we had not ceased when we\nfound the grinning face of one of the largest of those brutes close to\nour own.  He had dropped from the rock above us, like magic.  We all\nthree backed into the cave, very much frightened, for the teeth of the\nanimal were enormous, and he looked very savage.  He gave a shrill cry,\nand we perceived all the rest of the herd coming to him as fast as they\ncould.  I said that the cave was large enough to hold six of us; but\nthere was a sort of inner cave which we had not gone into, as the\nentrance was much smaller.  Romer cried out, `Let us go into the inside\ncave--we can get in one by one;' and he backed in; Hastings followed\nwith his bundle, and I hurried in after him just in time; for the\nbaboons, who had been chattering to each other for half a minute, came\ninto the outer cave just as I crawled into the inner.  Five or six of\nthem came in, all males, and very large.  The first thing they did was\nto lay hold of Romer's bundle, which they soon opened--at once they\nseized his provisions and rammed them into their pouches, and then they\npulled out the other things and tore them all to pieces.  As soon as\nthey had done with the bundle, two of them came towards the inner cave\nand saw us.  One put his long paw in to seize us; but Hastings gave him\na slash with his knife, and the animal took his paw out again fast\nenough.  It was laughable to see him hold out his hand to the others,\nand then taste the blood with the tip of his tongue, and such a\nchattering I never heard--they were evidently very angry, and more came\ninto the cave and joined them; then another put in his hand, and\nreceived a cut just as before.  At last, two or three at once tried to\npull us out, but we beat them all off with our knives, wounding them all\nvery severely.  For about an hour they continued their attempts, and\nthen they went away out of the cave, but remained at the mouth shrieking\nand howling.  We began to be very tired of this work, and Romer said\nthat he wished he was back in prison again; and so did I, I can assure\nyou; but there was no getting out, for had we gone out the animals would\nhave torn us to pieces.  We agreed that we had no chance but the animals\nbecoming tired and going away; and most anxious we were, for the\nexcitement had made us very thirsty, and we wanted water.  We remained\nfor two hours in this way imprisoned by baboons, when all of a sudden a\nshrill cry was given by one of the animals, and the whole herd went\ngalloping off as fast as they could, screaming louder than ever.  We\nwaited for a short time to see if they would return, and then Hastings\ncrawled out first, and looking out of the cave very cautiously, said\nthat they were all gone, and that he could see nothing but a Hottentot\nsitting down watching some cattle; we therefore all came out, very happy\nat our release.  That was our first adventure; we had plenty afterwards;\nbut I think it is now time we should go to bed.  It is my opinion we\nshall have a fine day to-morrow, sir; but there's no saying.\"\n\n\"I do so want to hear what happened to you afterwards, Ready,\" said\nWilliam.\n\n\"Well, so you shall; but there's a time for everything, and this is\nbed-time, unless you like to go with me; the weather has cleared up, and\nI want to catch a fish or two for to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35.\n\nAs Ready had predicted, the weather set in fine after the violent storm\nof which we have made mention.  For a fortnight, with little\nintermission, it continued fine, and during that time, Ready, Mr\nSeagrave, and William worked from daylight till dusk at the storehouse,\nwhich they were so anxious to complete, and were so tired when their\nwork was over, that even William did not ask Ready to go on with his\nhistory.  At last the storehouse was complete, thatched and wattled in\non three sides, leaving one open for ventilation; the lower part, which\nhad been arranged for the folding of the stock at night and during the\nrainy season, was also wattled in with cocoa-nut boughs on three sides,\nand made a very comfortable retreat for the animals.  The winding path\nto the storehouse was also cut through the cocoa-nut grove, but the\nstumps were not removed, as they could not spare the time.  All the\nstores that they had brought round were put into the storehouse, and\nthey were now ready to take up some other job.  It was, however, agreed\nthat, on the day after the building was finished, they should all have a\nday's holiday, which they certainly did require.  William caught some\nfish, a turtle was speared and wheeled up to the house; and they not\nonly had a holiday, but a feast.  Mr Seagrave and William had been\nwalking on the beach with Mrs Seagrave and the children, while Ready\nwas assisting Juno in cutting up the turtle; they had shown Mrs\nSeagrave the storehouse, and the goats with the four kids had been led\nthere, as there was no longer any occasion for them to remain in the\nhouse.  The weather was beautiful, and they agreed to go and examine the\ngarden.  They found that the seeds had not yet commenced sprouting,\nnotwithstanding the heavy rains.\n\n\"I should have thought that so much rain would have made them come up,\"\nsaid Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"they require more of the sun than\nthey will have till the rainy season is nearly over; a few days like\nthis, and they will soon be above-ground.\"\n\n\"Let us sit down on this knoll, it is quite dry,\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\"I little thought,\" continued she, \"that I could have been so happy in a\ndesert island.  I thought I should feel the loss of books very severely,\nbut I really do not think that I could have found time to read.\"\n\n\"Employment is a source of happiness, especially when you are usefully\nemployed.  An industrious person is always a happy person, provided he\nis not obliged to work too hard; and even where you have cause for\nunhappiness, nothing makes you forget it so soon as occupation.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, we shall not always have so much to do as we have now,\"\nsaid William.\n\n\"Of course not,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"and then we shall find our books\na great source of enjoyment.  I am anxious to go to the other side of\nthe island, and see what have been spared to us, and whether they have\nbeen much damaged; but that cannot be until after the rains are over,\nand we can use the boat again.\n\n\"Look at this minute insect which is crawling on my finger,\" said Mr\nSeagrave, turning to William: \"what a number of legs it has!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have seen something like it in old books.  How fast it runs with\nits little legs; thinner than hairs--how wonderful!\"\n\n\"Yes, William,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"we have only to examine into any\nportion, however small, of creation, and we are immediately filled with\nwonder.  There is nothing which points out to us the immensity and the\nomniscience of the Almighty more than the careful provision which has\nbeen made by Him for the smallest and most insignificant of created\nbeings.  This little animal is perhaps one of many millions, who have\ntheir term of existence, and their enjoyment, as well as we have.  What\nis it?--an insect of the minutest kind, a nothing in creation; yet has\nthe same care been bestowed upon its formation: these little legs,\nhardly visible, have their muscles and their sinews; and every other\nportion of its body is as complete, as fearfully and wonderfully\nfashioned, as our own.  Such is his will; and what insects we ought to\nfeel ourselves, when compared to the God of power and of love!\"\n\n\"Let me also point out to you, William,\" continued Mr Seagrave, \"the\ninfinity of his creative power, displayed in endless variety.  Amongst\nthe millions of men that have been born, and died, if ever yet were\nthere seen two faces or two bodies exactly alike; nay, if you could\nexamine the leaves upon the trees, although there may be millions upon\nmillions in a forest, you could not discover two leaves of precisely the\nsame form and make.\"\n\n\"I have often tried in vain,\" replied William; \"yet some animals are so\nmuch alike, that I cannot perceive any difference between them--sheep,\nfor instance.\"\n\n\"Very true; you cannot tell the difference, because you have not\nexamined them; but a shepherd, if he has seven hundred sheep under his\ncare, will know every one of them from the others; which proves that\nthere must be a great difference between them, although not perceptible\nto the casual observer; and the same, no doubt, is the case with all\nother classes of animals.\"\n\n\"Yes, William,\" observed Ready; \"I have often wondered over the things\nthat I have seen, and I have even in my ignorance felt what your papa\nhas now told you; and it has brought into my mind the words of Job:\n`When I consider, I am afraid of him.'\"\n\n\"Papa,\" said William, after a pause in the conversation, \"you have\nreferred to the variety--the wonderful variety--shown in the works of\nthe Deity.  Tell me some other prominent feature in creation.\"\n\n\"One of the most remarkable, William, is order.\"\n\n\"Point out to me, papa, where and in what that quality is most\nobservable.\"\n\n\"Everywhere and in everything, my dear boy; whether we cast our eyes up\nto the heavens above us, or penetrate into the bowels of the earth, the\nprinciple of order is everywhere--everything is governed by fixed laws,\nwhich cannot be disobeyed: we have order in the seasons, in the tides,\nin the movement of the heavenly bodies, in the instinct of animals, in\nthe duration of life assigned to each; from the elephant who lives more\nthan a century, to the ephemeral fly, whose whole existence is limited\nto an hour.\n\n\"Inanimate nature is subject to the same unvarying laws.  Metals, and\nrocks, and earths, and all the mineral kingdom follow one law in their\ncrystallisation, never varying from the form assigned to them; each atom\ndepositing itself in the allotted place, until that form is complete: we\nhave order in production, order in decay; but all is simple to him by\nwhom the planets were thrown out into space, and were commanded to roll\nin their eternal orbits.\"\n\n\"Yes; the stars in the heavens are beautiful,\" said William, \"but they\nare not placed there in order.\"\n\n\"The fixed stars do not appear to us to be in order--that is, they do\nnot stud the heavens at equal distances from each other as we view them;\nbut you must recollect that they are at very different distances from\nthis earth, spreading over all infinity of space; and we have reason to\nsuppose that this our earth is but a mere unit in the multitude of\ncreated worlds, only one single portion of an infinite whole.  As the\nstars now appear to us, they are useful to the mariner, enabling him to\ncross the trackless seas; and to the astronomer, who calculates the\ntimes and seasons.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, papa, by saying that this world of ours is supposed\nto be but one of a multitude of created worlds?\"\n\n\"Our little knowledge is bounded to this our own earth, which we have\nascertained very satisfactorily to be but one of several planets\nrevolving round our own sun.  I say our own sun, because we have every\nreason to suppose that each of those fixed stars, and myriads now not\nvisible to the naked eye, are all suns, bright and glorious as our own,\nand of course throwing light and heat upon unseen planets revolving\nround them.  Does not this give you some idea of the vastness, the\npower, and the immensity of God?\"\n\n\"One almost loses one's self in the imagination,\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"and it has been surmised by some, who have\nfelt in their hearts the magnificence of the Great Architect, that there\nmust be some point of view in space where all those glorious suns, which\nseem to us confused in the heavens above us, will appear all\nsymmetrically arranged, will there be viewed in regular order, whirling\nround in one stupendous and perfect system of beauty and design; and\nwhere can that be, if it is not in that heaven which we hope to gain?\"\n\nThere was a silence for a few moments, when William said, \"They say that\nthere are people who are atheists, papa.  How can they be so if they\nonly look around them?  I am sure a mere examination of the works of God\nought to make them good Christians.\"\n\n\"No, my child,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"there you are in error.  Few deny\nthe existence of a Deity, and an examination of his works may make them\ngood and devout men, but not Christians.  There are good men to be found\nunder every denomination, whether they be Jews, Mahomedans, or Pagans;\nbut they are not Christians.\"\n\n\"Very true, papa.\"\n\n\"Faith in things seen, if I may use the term, my dear child, may induce\nmen to acknowledge the power and goodness of the Almighty, but it will\nnot make them wise to salvation; for that end, it is necessary, as the\nApostle saith, to have faith in things not seen.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36.\n\n\"Well, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, after breakfast, \"which is to be our\nnext job?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I think we had better all set to, to collect the branches and\nends of the cocoa-nut trees cut down, and stack them for fuel.  Tommy\nand Juno have already made a good large pile, and I think, by to-night,\nwe shall have made the stack, and so arranged it that the rain will not\nget into it much.  After that, as the weather will not permit us to\nleave the house for any time, we will cut our salt-pan and make our\nfish-pond; they will take a week at least, and then we shall have little\nmore to do near home.  I think the strength of the rains is over\nalready, and perhaps in a fortnight we may venture to walk through the\nwood, and examine what we have saved from the wreck.\"\n\n\"And we are to explore the island; are we not, Ready?\" said William.  \"I\nlong to do that.\"\n\n\"Yes, William, but that must be almost the last job; for we shall be\naway for two or three nights, perhaps, and we must look out for fine\nweather.  We will, however, do that before we bring the stores round in\nthe boat.\"\n\n\"But how are we to make the salt-pan, Ready?  We must cut it out of the\nsolid rock.\"\n\n\"Yes, William; but I have three or four of what they call cold chisels,\nand with one of them and a hammer, we shall get on faster than you\nthink; for the coral rock, although hard at the surface, is soft a\nlittle below it.\"\n\nThe whole of that day was employed in piling up the cocoa-nut branches\nand wood.  Ready made a square stack, like a haystack, with a gable top,\nover which he tied the long branches, so that the rain would pour off\nit.\n\n\"There,\" said Ready, as he came down the ladder, \"that will be our\nprovision for next year; we have quite enough left to go on with till\nthe rainy season is over, and we shall have no difficulty in collecting\nit afterwards when the weather is dry.\"\n\nMr Seagrave sighed and looked grave; Ready observed it, and said, \"Mr\nSeagrave, it is not that we may want it; but still we must prepare for\nthe next rainy season, in case we do want it.  That Captain Osborn, if\nhe lives, will send to look for us, I have no doubt; nay, I believe that\nMackintosh will do the same; but still you must not forget that they all\nmay have perished, although we have been so mercifully preserved.  We\nmust put our trust in God, sir.\"\n\n\"We must, Ready; and if it is his will, we must not murmur.  I have\nschooled myself as much as possible; but thoughts will come in spite of\nmy endeavours to restrain them.\"\n\n\"Of course they will, sir; that's natural: however, sir, you must hope\nfor the best; fretting is no good, and it is sinful.\"\n\n\"I feel it is, Ready; and when I see how patient, and even happy, my\nwife is under such privations, I am angry with myself.\"\n\n\"A woman, sir, bears adversity better than a man.  A woman is all love,\nand if she has but her husband and children with her, and in good\nhealth, she will make herself happy almost anywhere: but men are\ndifferent: they cannot bear being shut out of the world as you are now.\"\n\n\"It is our ambition which makes us unhappy, Ready,\" replied Mr\nSeagrave; \"but let us say no more about it: God must dispose of me as he\nthinks fit.\"\n\nAfter supper, Ready, being requested by William, continued his\nnarrative.\n\n\"I left off, if I recollect right, William, just as the Hottentot, with\nthe cattle under his care, had frightened away the baboons who were\ntormenting us.  Well, we came out of the cave and sat down under the\nrock, so that the Hottentot could not see us, and we had a sort of\ncouncil of war.  Romer was for going back and giving ourselves up again;\nfor he said it was ridiculous to be wandering about without any arms to\ndefend ourselves against wild beasts, and that we might fall in with\nsomething worse than the baboons very soon; and he was right.  It would\nhave been the wisest thing which we could have done; but Hastings said,\nthat if we went back we should be laughed at, and the idea of being\nlaughed at made us all agree that we would not.  Bear this in mind,\nWilliam, and never let the fear of ridicule induce you to do what is\nwrong; or if you have done wrong, prevent you from returning to what is\nyour duty.\"\n\n\"Many thanks for your advice, Ready; I hope William will not forget it,\"\nsaid Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Well, sir, such was our reason for not giving up our mad scheme; and\nhaving so decided, the next point of consultation between us was, how we\nwere to procure arms and ammunition, which we could not do without.  As\nwe were talking this over, I peeped from behind the rock to see where\nthe Hottentot might be; I perceived that he had laid himself down, and\nwrapped himself up in his kross, a mantle of sheep-skins which they\nalways wear.  Now we had observed that he carried his musket in his\nhand, when we first saw him, as the Hottentots always go out armed, and\nI pointed out to Hastings and Romer that if he was asleep, we might get\npossession of his musket without his perceiving it.  This was a good\nidea, and Hastings said he would crawl to him on his hands and knees,\nwhile we remained behind the rock.  He did so very cautiously, and found\nthe man's head covered up in his kross and fast asleep; so there was no\nfear, for the Hottentots are very hard to wake at any time; that we knew\nwell.  Hastings first took the musket and carried it away out of the\nreach of the Hottentot, and then he returned to him, cut the leather\nthong which slung his powder-horn and ammunition, and retreated with all\nof them without disturbing the man from his sleep.  We were quite\noverjoyed at this piece of good luck, and determined to walk very\ncautiously some distance from where the Hottentot lay, that in case he\nawoke he should not see us.  Keeping our eyes about in every direction,\nlest we should meet with anybody else, we proceeded nearly a mile\ntowards Table Bay, when we fell in with a stream of water.  This was\nanother happy discovery, for we were very thirsty; so we concealed\nourselves near the stream after we had quenched our thirst, and made a\ndinner off the provisions we had brought with us.\"\n\n\"But, Ready, did you not do wrong to steal the Hottentot's musket?\"\n\n\"No, William; in that instance it could not be considered as a theft.\nWe were in an enemy's country, trying to escape; we were therefore just\nas much at war with the country as we were when they took us prisoners,\nand we no more stole the musket than they could be said to have stolen\nour ship.  Am I not right, Mr Seagrave?\"\n\n\"I believe you are justified in what may seem extreme acts for the\nrecovery of your liberty, after you have been made prisoners.  It has\nalways been so considered.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, to go on: we waited till dusk, and then we continued our\nmarch towards False Bay as fast as we could.  We knew that there were\nfarmers down in the valley, or rather on the sides of the hills, and we\nhoped to obtain, by some means or other, two more muskets.  It was near\ntwelve o'clock at night, with a bright moon, when we had a sight of the\nwater in False Bay, and soon afterwards we heard the baying of a large\ndog, and not far from us we distinguished two or three farmhouses, with\ntheir cattle-folds and orchards.  We then looked for a hiding-place,\nwhere we might remain till the morning; we found one between some large\npieces of rock.  We agreed that one should watch while the other two\nslept; this Hastings undertook to do, as he was not inclined to sleep.\nAt daylight he woke Romer and me, and we made our breakfast.  From the\nplace we were concealed in, we had a bird's-eye view of the farmhouse,\nand of what was going on.\n\n\"The farmhouse and buildings just below us were much smaller than the\nother two, which were more distant.  We watched the people as they went\nabout.  In about an hour the Hottentots came out, and we perceived that\nthey were yoking the oxen to the waggon; they yoked twelve pair, and\nthen the Hottentot driver got in and drove off towards Cape Town.  Soon\nafter that, another Hottentot drove the cows up the valley to feed; and\nthen a Dutch woman came out of the house with two children, and fed the\npoultry.\n\n\"We watched for another hour, and then the farmer himself made his\nappearance, with a pipe in his mouth, and sat down on a bench.  When his\npipe was out, he called to the house, and a Hottentot woman came to him\nwith more tobacco and a light.  During the whole of the day we did not\nsee any other people about the house, so we concluded that there were no\nmore than the farmer, his wife, the Hottentot woman, and two children.\nAbout two hours after noon the farmer went to the stable and led out his\nhorse, mounted, and rode away; we saw him speak to the Hottentot woman\nwhen he rode off, and she soon after went down the valley with a basket\non her head, and a long knife in her hand.  Then Hastings said it was\ntime that we moved, for there was but one woman in the house, and we\ncould easily overpower her and get what we wanted; still there was a\ngreat risk, as she might give the alarm, and we should have to escape in\nthe day-time, and might be seen and taken prisoners again.  However, as\nit was our only chance, we resolved to go down to the farmhouse very\ncautiously, and be all ready to seize any opportunity.  We crept down\nthe hill, and gained the fence, which was at the back of the farmhouse,\nwithout being discovered: we remained there for about a quarter of an\nhour, when, to our great joy, we observed the farmer's wife go out of\nthe house, leading a child in each hand; apparently she was going to\nvisit one of her neighbours, for she went in the direction of one of the\nother farms.  As soon as she was a hundred yards off, Hastings crept\nsoftly through the fence, and entered the farmhouse by the back-door; he\ncame out again, and made a sign for us to come in.  We found him already\nin possession of a rifle and a musket, which had been hanging over the\nfire-place, and we soon handed down the powder-horns and ammunition\npouches, which were hung up at a different part of the room, away from\nthe fire-place.\n\n\"Having gained these, Hastings set me to watch at the front door, lest\nanybody should return, while Romer and he looked out for something else\nin the way of provisions.  We got possession of three hams, and a large\nloaf of bread as big as a small washing-tub.  With these articles we\nmade our way safe back to our retreat.  We then looked round, and could\nsee nobody in any direction, so we presumed that we were not discovered.\nAs there was a sort of ravine full of rocks dividing the hill, which we\nwere obliged to pass before we could get into the valley, unless we went\ndown close to the farmhouse, we agreed that it would be better at once\nto cross it during the day-time, so that we should get that difficulty\nover, and, at the same time, be further from the farmhouse.  We did so;\nand found a very secure hiding-place, where we lay down, waiting for the\nsun to set before we started on our journey into the interior.  I think\nI had better leave off now, William, as it is getting late.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37.\n\nThe fishpond was commenced the next morning.  Ready, Mr Seagrave, and\nWilliam went down together to the beach, and, after much examination,\nchose a spot about one hundred yards from the turtle-pond as most\neligible for the purpose; the water being shallow, so that at the part\nfarthest from the shore there would not be more than three feet.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Ready, \"this is a very simple job; all we have to do is\nto collect small rocks and stones, pile them up wall-fashion inside, and\nwith a slope outside, so as to break the force of the waves when the\nwater is a little rough; of course, the water will find its way through\nthe stones, and will be constantly changed.  It's very true, that we can\nat most times catch fish when we want them, but it is not always that we\ncan spare the time, so it's just as well to have always a certain\nquantity at hand, to take out at a moment's warning; and we can, of\ncourse, catch them and put them in here when we have nothing else to do.\nJuno will be able to come down and take them out with a spear, when we\nare away and she wants something for dinner.\"\n\n\"But there are few stones about here, Ready; we shall have to fetch them\na long way,\" said William.\n\n\"Well, then, William, let us get the wheels down here, and then we can\ncarry a quantity at a time.\"\n\n\"But how shall we carry them, Ready?\"\n\n\"We will sling a tub on the axle; I will go up and get that ready and\nbring it down; in the meantime, you and Mr Seagrave can collect all the\nstones which are near at hand.\"\n\nReady soon returned with the wheels, and the tub slung with rope on the\naxle, and by that means they found that they could collect the stones\nvery fast; Mr Seagrave and William bringing them, and Ready in the\nwater, building up the wall.\n\n\"We have quite forgot another job which we must put in hand, sir,\"\nobserved Ready; \"but the fish-pond reminds me of it.\"\n\n\"What is that, Ready?\"\n\n\"A bathing-place for the children, and indeed for us all; we shall want\nit when the hot weather comes on, but we will put it off till then.  I\ncan tell you, sir, that although I don't mind building this wall in the\nshallow water, I shall be very careful when the water is up to my knees,\nfor you don't know how bold the sharks are in these latitudes.  When I\nwas at St. Helena, not very long ago, we had a melancholy proof of it.\"\n\n\"Tell us the story, Ready.\"\n\n\"Well, two soldiers were standing on the rocks at St. Helena; the rocks\nwere out of the water, but the swell just broke over them.  Two sharks\nswam up to them, and one of them, with a blow of his tail, turning round\nthe same way, tripped one of them into the water, which was very deep.\nHis comrade was very much frightened, and ran to the barracks to tell\nthe story.  About a week afterwards, a schooner was in Sandy Bay, on the\nother side of the island, and the people seeing a very large shark under\nthe stern, put out a hook with a piece of pork, and caught him; they\nopened him, and found inside of him, to their horror, the whole of the\nbody of the soldier, except the legs below the knees: the monster had\nswallowed him whole, with the exception of his legs, which it had nipped\noff when it closed its jaws.\"\n\n\"I really had no idea that they were so bold, Ready.\"\n\n\"It is a fact, I assure you; and therefore we cannot be too careful how\nwe go into the water: you saw how soon the poor pig was despatched.\"\n\n\"I wonder how the pigs get on, Ready,\" said William.\n\n\"I dare say they have littered by this time, sir; they have no want of\nfood.\"\n\n\"But can they eat the cocoa-nuts?\"\n\n\"Not the old ones, but they can the young ones, which are constantly\ndropping from the trees, and then there's plenty of roots for them.  If\nwe stay long here we shall soon have good sport hunting them; but we\nmust be very careful; for although they were tame pigs when we brought\nthem on shore, they will be wild and very savage in a very short time.\"\n\n\"How must we hunt them?\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Why, sir, with the dogs, and then shoot them.  I am glad that Vixen\nwill have pups soon; we shall want more dogs.\"\n\n\"Shall we not have more mouths than we can find food for?\"\n\n\"Never fear that, sir, as long as we have the sea to fish in.  Dogs live\nvery well upon fish, even if it is raw.\"\n\n\"We shall have some lambs soon, Ready, shall we not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I expect very soon.  I wish we had more food for the animals:\nthey are put rather hard to it just now; but next year, if we find more\nfood on the island, we must keep the grass near home, to make hay and\nstack it for the winter time--or the rainy season rather, for there is\nno winter in these latitudes.  I'm pretty sure we shall find some clear\nland on the south of the island, for the cocoa-nut grove does not extend\nso close to the water on that side as it does on the north.\"\n\n\"I do so long to go on our exploring party,\" said William.\n\n\"We must wait a little,\" replied Ready; \"but I don't know whether you\nwill go; we must not all three go at once, and leave Mrs Seagrave\nalone.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"that would not be fair; either you or I\nmust remain, William.\"\n\nWilliam made no reply, but it was evident that he was annoyed at the\nidea of not being of the party.  They worked very hard that day, and the\nwalls rose fast out of the water.\n\nAfter supper, Ready continued his narrative.  \"We remained concealed\nuntil it was dark, and then Hastings and Romer, each with a musket on\nhis shoulders and a ham at his back; and I, being the smallest, with the\nrifle and the great loaf of bread, set off on our journey.  Our\nintention was to travel north, as we knew that was the road leading from\nthe colony; but Hastings had decided that we should first go to the\neastward, so as to make what we sailors call a circumbendibus, which\nwould keep us out of the general track.  We passed through the deep\nsands of False Bay, and after that gradually ascended, getting among\nbrushwood and young trees; but we saw no signs of cultivation, nor did\nwe pass one house after we had left False Bay astern of us.  About\ntwelve o'clock we were very much fatigued, and longed for a drink of\nwater, but we did not find any, although the moon shone as bright as\nday.  We distinctly heard, however, what we did not much like, the\nhowling and cries of the wild beasts which increased as we went on;\nstill we did not see any, and that was our comfort.  At last we were so\ntired that we all sat down on the ledge of a rock.  We dared not go to\nsleep, so we remained there till daylight, listening to the howling of\nthe animals.  We none of us spoke, and I presume that Hastings' and\nRomer's thoughts were the same as my own, which were, that I would have\ngiven a great deal to find myself safe and sound again within the prison\nwalls.  However, daylight came at last; the wild beasts did not prowl\nany more; we walked on till we found a stream of water, where we sat\ndown and took our breakfast, after which our courage revived, and we\ntalked and laughed as we walked on, just as we had done before.  We now\nbegan to ascend the mountains, which Hastings said must be the Black\nMountains that the soldiers had talked to us about.  They were very\ndesolate; and when night came on we collected brushwood, and cut down\nbranches with our knives, that we might make a fire, not only to warm\nourselves, but to scare away the wild beasts, whose howling had already\ncommenced.  We lighted our fire and ate our supper; the loaf was half\ngone, and the hams had been well cut into--we knew, therefore, that very\nsoon we should have to trust to our guns for procuring food.  As soon as\nwe had finished our meal, we lay down by the fire, with our muskets\nloaded close to us, and our ammunition placed out of danger.  We were so\ntired that we were soon fast asleep.  It had been agreed that Romer\nshould keep the first watch, and Hastings the middle, and I the morning;\nbut Romer fell asleep, and the consequence was, that the fire was not\nkept up.  It was about midnight that I was awakened by something\nbreathing hard in my face, and just as I could recall my senses and open\nmy eyes, I found myself lifted up by my waistband, and the teeth of some\nanimal pinching my flesh.  I tried to catch at my musket, but I put out\nmy wrong hand, and laid hold of a still lighted brand out of the fire,\nwhich I darted into the animal's face; it let me drop directly, and ran\naway.\"\n\n\"What a providential escape!\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes, it was, ma'am; the animal was a hyena.  Fortunately they are a\nvery cowardly sort of beast; still, had it not been for the lighted\nstick, it would have carried me off, for I was very small then, and it\nlifted me up as if I was a feather in its mouth.  The shout I gave woke\nHastings, who seized his musket and fired.  I was very much frightened,\nas you may suppose.  As for Romer, he never woke till we pushed him\nhard, he was so completely knocked up.  This affair, of course, made us\nmore cautious, and afterwards we lighted two fires, and slept between\nthem, one always remaining on the watch.  For a week we travelled on,\nand as soon as we were over the mountains, we turned our heads to the\nnorthward.  Our provisions were all gone, and we were one day without\nany; but we killed an antelope called a spring-bock, which gave us\nprovisions for three or four days: there was no want of game after we\nhad descended into the plain.  I forgot to mention, however, a narrow\nescape we had, just before we had left an extensive forest on the side\nof the mountain.  We had walked till past noon, and were very much\ntired; we decided upon taking our dinner under a large tree, and we\nthrew ourselves down in the shade.  Hastings was lying on his back, with\nhis eyes looking upwards, when he perceived on the lower branch of the\ntree a panther, which lay along it, his green eyes fixed upon us, and\nready to spring; he seized his musket, and fired it without taking aim,\nfor there was no time; but the ball entered the stomach of the animal,\nand, as it appeared, divided its back-bone.  Down came the beast, within\nthree or four feet of where we lay, with a loud roar, and immediately\ncrouched to spring upon Romer; but it could not, for the back-bone being\nbroken, it had not any power in its hinder quarters, so it raised up its\nfore quarters, and then dropped down again.  I never saw such rage and\nfury in an animal in my life.  At first we were too much frightened to\nfire; but, perceiving that the beast could not spring, Hastings snatched\nthe musket from Romer and shot it through the head.\n\n\"We were now obliged to hunt for our livelihood, and we became bolder\nthan ever.  Our clothes were all in rags; but we had plenty of powder\nand ammunition; there were hundreds and hundreds of antelopes and gnus\nin the plain--indeed, sometimes it was impossible to count them.  But\nthis plentiful supply of game was the cause of our being in greater\ndanger, for now, for the first time, we heard the roar of the lions\nevery night.  We made large fires to keep them off, but they often made\nus tremble when they came near to us.\"\n\n\"Did you ever meet with one in the day-time?\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, sir; we often saw them, but they never attacked us, and we were\ntoo much afraid to fire at them.  Once we met one face to face.  We had\nkilled an antelope called a hartebeest, and, with our muskets on our\nshoulders, were running to secure it.  Just as we came up to the spot,\nwe heard a roar, and found ourselves not ten yards from a lion, who was\nlying on the top of the beast we had killed, his eyes flashing fire at\nus, and half raising himself, as if ready for a spring.  We all took to\nour heels as fast as we could.  I never looked back till I was out of\nbreath: but the lion was content with our running away, and did not take\nthe trouble to follow us.  Well, sir, we had been travelling, we really\nhardly knew where, but certainly in a northerly direction, for three\nweeks, and were quite worn out: we now all agreed that we had done a\nvery foolish thing, and would gladly have gone back again.  For my part,\nI declare that I was willing to lie down and die, if I could have so\ndone, and I became quite indifferent to the roaring of the lions, and\nfelt as if I should be glad if one would have made a meal of me.  At\nlength, one morning, we fell in with a party of natives.  They were of\nthe Karroo tribe, as they told us by pointing to themselves, and saying,\n`Karroos', and then they pointed to us, and said `Dutch'.  We shot game,\nand gave it to them, which pleased them very much, and they remained\nwith us for five or six days.  We tried by signs to inquire of them, if\nthere were any Dutch settlement about there; and they understood us, and\nsaid that there was, in a direction which they pointed out to us, to the\nnorth-east.  We offered them a present if they would show us the way.\nTwo of the men agreed to go with us; the rest of the tribe, with the\nwomen and children, went southward.  The next day we arrived at a Dutch\nsettlement of three or four farmhouses, called Graaff Reinet; but I must\nleave off now, for it is past bed-time.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38.\n\nThe construction of the fish-pond proceeded rapidly, and on the third\nday it was nearly complete.  As soon as all the walls were finished,\nReady threw out sand and shingle, so as to make the part next to the\nbeach nearly as deep as the other; so that there might be sufficient\nwater to prevent the gulls and man-of-war birds from darting down, and\nstriking the fish.  While Ready was thus employed, Mr Seagrave and\nWilliam collected more rocks, so as to divide the pond into four parts,\nat the same time allowing a communication between each part.  These\ninside walls, as well as the outside, were made of sufficient width to\nwalk upon; by which means they would have all the fish within reach of\nthe spear, in case they wished to take them out.  The day after the pond\nwas completed the weather changed.  The rain poured down with great\nforce, but it was not accompanied with such terrific thunder and\nlightning, nor were the storms of so long continuance, as at the\ncommencement of the rainy season.  In the intervals of fine weather they\ncaught a great many fish, which they put into the pond, so that it was\nwell stocked.  But a circumstance occurred, which was the occasion of\ngreat alarm to them all; which was, that one evening William was taken\nwith a shivering, and complained very much of a pain in his head.  Ready\nhad promised to continue his narrative on that evening, but William was\ntoo ill to sit up.  He was put into bed, and the next morning he was in\na violent fever.  Mr Seagrave was much alarmed, as the symptoms were\nworse every hour; and Ready, who had sat up with him during the night,\ncalled Mr Seagrave out of the house, and said, \"This is a bad case,\nsir: William was working yesterday with his hat off, and I fear that he\nhas been struck by the sun.\"\n\nThe poor boy was for many days in great danger; and the cheerful house\nwas now one of gloom and silence.  How fervent were now the morning and\nevening prayers; how often during the day did his parents offer up a\npetition to heaven for their dear boy's recovery.  The weather became\nfiner every day, and it was almost impossible to keep Tommy quiet: Juno\nwent out with him and Albert every morning, and kept them with her while\nshe cooked; and, fortunately, Vixen had some young ones, and when Juno\ncould no longer amuse them, she brought them two of the puppies to play\nwith.  As for the quiet, meek little Caroline, she would remain during\nthe whole day holding her mother's hand, and watching her brother, or\nworking with her needle by the side of his bed.\n\nReady, who could not be idle, had taken the hammer and cold chisel to\nmake the salt-pan, at which he worked during those portions of the day\nin which his services were not required indoors; and as he sat chipping\naway the rock, his thoughts were ever upon William, for he dearly loved\nthe boy for his amiable disposition and his cleverness; and many a time\nduring the day would he stop his work, and the tears would run down his\ncheeks as he offered up his petition to the Almighty that the boy might\nbe spared to his afflicted parents.  And those prayers were heard, for\non the ninth day William was pronounced by Ready and Mr Seagrave to\nhave much less fever, and shortly afterwards it left him altogether; but\nhe was so weak that he could not raise himself in his bed for two or\nthree days; and it was not till more than a fortnight after the fever\nhad left him that he could go out of the house.  The joy that was\nexpressed by them all when the change took place may be imagined: nor\nwere the thanksgivings less fervent than had been the prayers.\n\nDuring his convalescence, as there was nothing else to do, Mr Seagrave\nand Ready, who now went gladly to their work, determined, as the\nsalt-pan was finished, that they would make a bathing-place.  Juno came\nto their assistance, and was very useful in assisting to drag the wheels\nwhich brought the rocks and stones; and Tommy was also brought down,\nthat he might be out of the way while Mrs Seagrave and Caroline watched\nthe invalid.  By the time that William was able to go out of the house,\nthe bathing-place was finished, and there was no longer any fear of the\nsharks.  William came down to the beach with his mother, and looked at\nthe work which had been done; he was much pleased with it, and said,\n\"Now, Ready, we have finished everything at home for the present; all we\nhave to do is to explore the island, and to go to the cove and examine\nour collection from the wreck.\"\n\n\"Very true, William; and the weather has been so fine, that I think we\nmay venture upon one or the other in a few days more; but not till you\nare stronger.\"\n\n\"I shall soon be strong again, Ready.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it, William; and we have good reason to thank God,\nfor we could ill spare you.\"\n\n\"It's a long while since you have gone on with your story, Ready,\" said\nWilliam, after they had taken their supper; \"I wish you would do so now,\nas I am sure I shall not be tired.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, William,\" replied Ready; \"but can you remember where I\nleft off, for my memory is none of the best?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; if you recollect, you had just arrived at a Dutch farmer's\nhouse, in company with the savages, at a place called Graaff Reinet, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Well then, the Dutch farmer came out when he saw us coming, and asked\nus who we were.  We told him that we were English prisoners, and that we\nwished to give ourselves up to the authorities.  He took away our arms\nand ammunition, and said that he was the authority in that part, which\nwas true enough; and then he said, `You'll not run away without arms and\nammunition, that's certain.  As for sending you to the Cape, that I may\nnot be able to do for months; so if you wish to be fed well, you must\nwork well while you're here.'  We replied, that we should be very glad\nto make ourselves useful, and then he sent us some dinner by a Hottentot\ngirl.  But we soon found out that we had to deal with an ill-tempered,\nbrutal fellow; and that he gave us plenty of hard work, but by no means\nplenty of food.  He would not trust us with guns, so the Hottentots went\nout with the cattle, but he gave us plenty of work to do about the\nhouse; and at last he treated us very cruelly.  When he was short of\nprovisions for the Hottentots and other slaves, of whom he had a good\nmany, he would go out with the other farmers who lived near him, and\nshoot quaggas for them to eat.  Nobody but a Hottentot could live upon\nsuch flesh.\"\n\n\"What is quagga?\"\n\n\"A wild ass, partly covered with stripes, but not so much as the zebra;\na pretty animal to look at, but the flesh is very bad.  At last he would\ngive us nothing to eat but quaggas, the same as the Hottentots, while he\nand his family--for he had a wife and five children--lived upon mutton\nand the flesh of the antelope, which is very excellent eating.  We asked\nhim to allow us a gun to procure better food, and he kicked Romer so\nunmercifully, that he could not work for two days afterwards.  Our lives\nbecame quite a burden to us; we were employed all day on the farm, and\nevery day he was more brutal towards us.  At last we agreed that we\nwould stand it no longer, and one evening Hastings told him so.  This\nput him into a great rage, and he called two of the slaves, and ordered\nthem to tie him to the waggon wheel, swearing that he would cut every\nbit of skin off his body, and he went into his house to get his whip.\nThe slaves had hold of Hastings, and were tying him up, for they dared\nnot disobey their master, when he said to us, `If I am flogged this way,\nit will be all over with us.  Now's your time; run back behind the\nhouse, and when he comes out with the whip, do you go in and seize the\nmuskets, which are always ready loaded.  Hold him at bay till I get\nclear, and then we will get away somehow or other.  You must do it, for\nI am sure he will flog me till I am dead, and he will shoot you, as\nrunaway prisoners, as he did his two Hottentots the other day.'  As\nRomer and I thought this very probable, we did as Hastings told us; and\nwhen the Dutchman had gone towards him where he was tied up, about fifty\nyards from the house, we went in.  The farmer's wife was in bed, having\njust had an addition to her family, and the children we cared not for.\nWe seized two muskets and a large knife, and came out just as the\nDutchman had struck the first blow with the rhinoceros whip, which was\nso severe, that it took away poor Hastings' breath.  We went up; he\nturned round and saw us: we levelled our muskets at him, and he stopped.\n`Another blow, and we'll shoot you,' cried Romer.  `Yes,' cried I; `we\nare only boys, but you've Englishmen to deal with.'  When we came up,\nRomer kept his piece levelled at the Dutchman, while I passed him, and\nwith the knife cut the thongs which bound Hastings.  The Dutchman turned\npale and did not speak, he was so frightened, and the slaves ran away.\nAs soon as Hastings was free, he seized a large wooden mallet, used for\ndriving in stakes, and struck the Dutchman down to the earth, crying\nout, `That for flogging an Englishman, you rascal!'\n\n\"While the man lay senseless or dead--I didn't know which at the time--\nwe tied him to the waggon wheels, and returning to the house, seized\nsome ammunition and other articles which might be useful.  We then went\nto the stables, and took the three best horses which the Dutchman had,\nput some corn in a sack for each of them, took some cord for halters,\nmounted, and rode away as fast as we could.  As we knew that we should\nbe pursued, we first galloped away as if we were going eastward to the\nCape; and then, as soon as we were on ground which would not show the\ntracks of our horses' hoofs, we turned round to the northward, in the\ndirection of the Bushman country.  It was dark soon after we had altered\nour course; but we travelled all night, and although we heard the\nroaring of the lions at a distance, we met with no accident.  At\ndaylight we rested our horses, and gave them some corn, and then sat\ndown to eat some of the provision we had brought with us.\"\n\n\"How long were you with the farmer at Graaff Reinet?\"\n\n\"Nearly eight months, sir; and during that time we could not only speak\nDutch, but we could make ourselves understood by the Hottentots and\nother natives.  While we were eating we held a consultation how we\nshould proceed.  We were aware that the Dutchmen would shoot us if they\ncame up with us, and that they would come out in strong force against\nus; and we were afraid that we had killed the man, and if so, they would\nhang us as soon as we got to the Cape; so we were at a great loss to\nknow how to act.  At last we decided that we would cross the country of\nthe Bushmen, and get to the sea-side, to the northward of the Cape.  We\ndetermined that it would be better to travel at night, as there would be\nless fear of the wild beasts, or of being seen; so we went fast asleep\nfor many hours.  Towards the evening, we found water for the horses, and\nthen we fed them again, and proceeded on our journey.  I won't tell what\npassed every day for a fortnight, by which time we had pretty well\nkilled our horses, and we were compelled to stop among a tribe of\nGorraguas, a very mild, inoffensive people, who supplied us with milk,\nand treated us very kindly.  We had some adventures, nevertheless.  One\nday as we were passing by a tuft of small trees, a rhinoceros charged\nupon my horse, which very narrowly escaped by wheeling short round and\ngetting behind him; the beast then made off without meddling with us any\nmore.  Every day we used to shoot some animal or other, for provision:\nsometimes it was a gnu, something between an antelope and a bull; at\nother times it was one of the antelope kind.\n\n\"Well, we stayed for three weeks with these people, and gave our horses\ntime to refresh themselves; and then we set off again, keeping more\ntowards the coast as we went southward, for the Gorraguas told us that\nthere was a fierce native tribe, called Kaffers, to the northward, who\nwould certainly kill us if we went there.  The fact is, we did not know\nwhat to do.  We had left the Cape without any exact idea where we should\ngo to, like foolish boys as we were, and we became more entangled with\ndifficulties every day.  At last we decided that it would be better to\nfind our way back to the Cape, and deliver ourselves up as prisoners,\nfor we were tired out with fatigue and constant danger.  All that we\nwere afraid of was that we had killed the Dutch farmer at Graaff Reinet,\nwho had treated us so brutally; but Hastings said he did not care; that\nwas his business, and he would take his chance: so when we bade adieu to\nthe Gorraguas, we turned our horses' heads to the south-east, so as to\nmake the sea and go to the southward at the same time.\n\n\"I have now to mention a most melancholy event which occurred.  Two days\nafter we had recommenced our travels, in passing through some high\ngrass, we stumbled on a lion, which was devouring a gnu.  Romer, who\nhappened to be some ten yards foremost of the three, was so alarmed that\nhe fired at the animal, which we had agreed never to do, as it was folly\nto enrage so powerful a beast, when our party was so small.  The lion\nwas slightly wounded; he gave a roar that might have been heard for a\nmile, sprang upon Romer, and with one blow of his paw knocked him off\nthe saddle into the bushes.  Our horses, which were frightened, wheeled\nround and fled, for the animal was evidently about to attack us.  As it\nwas, he did make one bound in our direction; we could not pull up until\nwe had gone half a mile; and when we did, we saw the lion had torn down\nthe horse which Romer had ridden, and was dragging away the carcass to\nthe right at a sort of a canter, without any apparent effort on his\npart.  We waited till he was well off, and then rode back to the spot\nwhere Romer had fallen: we soon found him, but he was quite dead; the\nblow with the lion's paw had fractured his skull.\n\n\"I ought to have said that the Gorraguas told us not to travel by night,\nbut by day; and we had done so in consequence of their advice.  I\nbelieve it was very good advice, notwithstanding this unfortunate\naccident, for we found that when we had travelled all night the lions\nhad more than once followed us the whole time; and indeed I have often\nthought since that we were altogether indebted to his mercy who ordereth\nall things, both in heaven and earth, that we escaped so well as we did.\nThree days after poor Romer's death we first saw the wide ocean again.\nWe kept near the coast, but we soon found that we could not obtain the\nsupply of game, or fuel for our fires at night, so well as we could in\nthe interior, and we agreed to get away from the coast again.  We had a\ndreary plain to pass over, and we were quite faint for want of food--for\nwe had been without any for nearly two days--when we came upon an\nostrich.  Hastings put his horse to his speed, but it was of no use--the\nostrich ran much faster than the horse could.  I remained behind, and,\nto my great joy, discovered his nest, with thirteen large eggs in it.\nHastings soon came back, with his horse panting and out of wind.  We sat\ndown, lighted a fire, and roasted two of the eggs: we made a good dinner\nof them, and having put four more on our saddle-bows, we continued our\njourney.  At last, one forenoon, we saw the Table Mountain, and were as\nglad to see it as if we had seen the white cliffs of Old England.  We\npushed on our horses with the hopes of being once more comfortably in\nprison before night; when, as we neared the bay, we noticed that English\ncolours were flying on board of the vessels in the road.  This surprised\nus very much; but soon after that we met an English soldier, who told us\nthat the Cape had been taken by our forces more than six months ago.\nThis was a joyful surprise, as you may suppose.  We rode into the town,\nand reported ourselves to the main guard; the governor sent for us,\nheard our story, and sent us to the admiral, who took us on board of his\nown ship.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39.\n\nThe next morning, as there was no particular work on hand, Ready and Mr\nSeagrave took the lines to add to the stock of the fish-pond.  As the\nweather was fine and cool, William accompanied them, that he might have\nthe benefit of the fresh air.  As they passed the garden, they observed\nthat the seeds sown had already sprung up an inch or two above the\nground, and that, apparently none of them had missed.  While Ready and\nMr Seagrave were fishing, and William sitting near them, William said\nto his father--\n\n\"Many of the islands near us are inhabited; are they not, papa?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not those very near us, I believe.  At all events, I never\nheard any voyagers mention having seen inhabitants on the isles near\nwhich we suppose the one we are on to be.\"\n\n\"What sort of people are the islanders in these seas?\"\n\n\"They are various.  The New Zealanders are the most advanced in\ncivilisation.  The natives of Van Diemen's Land and Australia are some\nportions of them of a very degraded class--indeed, little better than\nthe beasts of the field.\"\n\n\"I have seen them,\" said Ready; \"and I think I can mention a people, not\nvery numerous indeed, who are still more like the beasts of the field.\nI saw them once; and, at first, thought they were animals, and not human\nbeings.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Ready; where may that be?\"\n\n\"In the Great Andaman Isles, at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal.  I once\nanchored in distress in Port Cornwallis, and the morning after we\nanchored, we saw some black things going upon all fours under the trees\nthat came down to the water's edge.  We got the telescope, and perceived\nthen that they were men and women, for they stood upright.\"\n\n\"Did you ever come into contact with them?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I did not; but I met, at Calcutta, a soldier who had; for at\none time the East India Company intended making a settlement on the\nisland, and sent some troops there.  He said that they caught two of\nthem; that they were not more than four feet high, excessively stupid\nand shy; they had no houses or huts to live in, and all that they did\nwas to pile up some bushes to keep the wind off.\"\n\n\"Had they any arms?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, they had bows and arrows; but so miserably made, and so\nsmall, that they could not kill anything but very small birds.\"\n\n\"Where did the people come from who inhabited these islands, papa?\"\n\n\"That is difficult to say, William; but it is supposed that they have\nbecome inhabited in much the same way as this our island has been--that\nis, by people in canoes or boats driven out to sea, and saving their\nlives by effecting a landing, as we have done.\"\n\n\"I believe that's the truth,\" replied Ready; \"I heard say that the\nAndaman Isles were supposed to have been first inhabited by a slaver\nfull of negroes, who were wrecked on the coast in a typhoon.\"\n\n\"What is a typhoon, Ready?\"\n\n\"It is much the same as a hurricane, William; it comes on in India at\nthe change of the monsoons.\"\n\n\"But what are monsoons?\"\n\n\"Winds that blow regular from one quarter so many months during the\nyear, and then change round and blow from another just as long.\"\n\n\"And what are the trade-winds, which I heard poor Captain Osborn talking\nabout after we left Madeira?\"\n\n\"The trade-winds blow on the equator, and several degrees north and\nsouth of it, from the east to the west, following the course of the\nsun.\"\n\n\"Is it the sun which produces these winds?\"\n\n\"Yes, the extreme heat of the sun between the tropics rarefies the air\nas the earth turns round, and the trade-winds are produced by the\nrushing in of the less heated air.\"\n\n\"Yes, William; and the trade-winds produce what they call the Gulf\nStream,\" observed Ready.\n\n\"How is that?  I have heard it spoken of, papa.\"\n\n\"The winds, constantly following the sun across the Atlantic Ocean, and\nblowing from east to west, have great effect upon the sea, which is\nforced up into the Gulf of Mexico (where it is stopped by the shores of\nAmerica), so that it is many feet higher in the Gulf than in the eastern\npart of the Atlantic.  This accumulation of water must of course find a\nvent somewhere, and it does in what is called the Gulf Stream, by which\nthe waters are poured out, running very strong to the northward, along\nthe shores of America, and then [westward] eastward, passing not far\nfrom Newfoundland, until its strength is spent somewhere to the\nnorthward of the Azores.\"\n\n\"The Gulf Stream, William,\" said Ready, \"is always several degrees\nwarmer than the sea in general, which is, they say, owing to its waters\nremaining in the Gulf of Mexico so long, where the heat of the sun is so\ngreat.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the land and sea breezes in the West Indies, and\nother hot climates, papa?\"\n\n\"It is the wind first blowing off from the shore, and then blowing from\nthe sea towards the shore, during certain hours of the day, which it\ndoes regularly every twenty-four hours.  This is also the effect of the\nheat of the sun.  The sea breeze commences in the morning, and in the\nafternoon it dies away, when the land breeze commences, which lasts till\nmidnight.\"\n\n\"There are latitudes close to the trade-winds,\" said Ready, \"where the\nwind is not certain, where ships have been becalmed for weeks; the crews\nhave exhausted the water on board, and they have suffered dreadfully.\nWe call them the Horse latitudes--why, I do not know.  But it is time\nfor us to leave off, and for Master William to go into the house.\"\n\nThey returned home, and after supper Ready went on with his narrative.\n\n\"I left off at the time that I was sent on board of the man-of-war, and\nI was put down on the books as a supernumerary boy.  I was on board of\nher for nearly four years, and we were sent about from port to port, and\nfrom clime to clime, until I grew a strong, tall lad, and was put into\nthe mizen-top.  I found it very comfortable.  I did my duty, and the\nconsequence was, I never was punished; for a man may serve on board of a\nman-of-war without fear of being punished, if he only does his duty, and\nthe duty is not very hard either; not like on board of the merchant\nvessels, where there are so few hands--there it is hard work.  Of\ncourse, there are some captains who command men-of-war who are harsh and\nsevere; but it was my good fortune to be with a very mild and steady\ncaptain, who was very sorry when he was obliged to punish the men,\nalthough he would not overlook any improper conduct.  The only thing\nwhich was a source of constant unhappiness to me was, that I could not\nget to England again, and see my mother.  I had written two or three\nletters, but never had an answer; and at last I became so impatient that\nI determined to run away the very first opportunity which might offer.\nWe were then stationed in the West Indies, and I had very often\nconsultations with Hastings on the subject, for he was quite as anxious\nto get away as I was; and we had agreed that we would start off together\nthe very first opportunity.  At last we anchored in Port Royal, Jamaica,\nand there was a large convoy of West India ships, laden with sugar,\nabout to sail immediately.  We knew that if we could get on board of\none, they would secrete us until the time of sailing, for they were\nshort-handed enough, the men-of-war having pressed every man they could\nlay their hands upon.  There was but one chance, and that was by\nswimming on board of one of the vessels during the night-time, and that\nwas easy enough, as they were anchored not a hundred yards from our own\nship.  What we were afraid of was the sharks, which were so plentiful in\nthe harbour.  However, the night before the convoy was to sail we made\nup our minds that we would run the risk, for we were so impatient to\nescape that we did not care for anything.  It was in the middle watch--I\nrecollect it, and shall recollect it all my life, as if it were last\nnight--that we lowered ourselves down very softly from the bows of the\nship, and as soon as we were in the water we struck out for one of the\nWest Indiamen close to us.  The sentry at the gangway saw the light in\nthe water made by our swimming through it, and he hailed, of course; we\ngave no answer, but swam as fast as we could; for after he had hailed we\nheard a bustle, and we knew that the officer of the watch was manning a\nboat to send after us.  I had just caught hold of the cable of the West\nIndiaman, and was about to climb up by it, for I was a few yards before\nHastings, when I heard a loud shriek, and, turning round, perceived a\nshark plunging down with Hastings in his jaws.  I was so frightened,\nthat for a short time I could not move: at last I recovered myself, and\nbegan to climb up by the cable as fast as I could.  I was just in time,\nfor another shark made a rush at me; and although I was clear out of the\nwater more than two feet, he sprung up and just caught my shoe by the\nheel, which he took down with him.  Fear gave me strength, and in a\nsecond or two afterwards I was up at the hawse-holes, and the men on\nboard, who had been looking over the bows, and had witnessed poor\nHastings' death, helped me on board, and hurried me down below, for the\nboat from our ship was now nearly alongside.  When the officer of the\nboat came on board, they told him they had perceived us both in the\nwater, close to their vessel, and that the sharks had taken us down.  As\nthe shriek of Hastings was heard by the people in the boat, the officer\nbelieved that it was the case, and returned to the ship.  I heard the\ndrum beat to quarters on board of the man-of-war, that they might\nascertain who were the two men who had attempted to swim away, and a few\nminutes afterwards they beat the retreat, having put down D.D. against\nmy name on the books, as well as against that of poor Hastings.\"\n\n\"What does D.D. mean?\"\n\n\"D stands for discharged from the service; D.D. stands for dead,\"\nreplied Ready; \"and it was only through the mercy of Providence that I\nwas not so.\"\n\n\"It was a miraculous escape indeed,\" observed Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, sir; I can hardly describe my sensations for some hours\nafterwards.  I tried to sleep, but could not--I was in agony.  The\nmoment I slumbered, I thought the shark had hold of me, and I would\nstart up and shriek; and then I said my prayers and tried to go to sleep\nagain, but it was of no use.  The captain of the West Indiaman was\nafraid that my shrieks would be heard, and he sent me down a tumbler of\nrum to drink off; this composed me, and at last I fell into a sound\nsleep.  When I awoke, I found that the ship was under weigh and with all\ncanvas set, surrounded by more than a hundred other vessels; the\nmen-of-war who took charge of the convoy, firing guns and making signals\nincessantly.  It was a glorious sight, and we were bound for Old\nEngland.  I felt so happy, that I thought I would risk the jaws of\nanother shark to have regained my liberty, and the chance of being once\nmore on shore in my own country, and able to go to Newcastle and see my\npoor mother.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that your miraculous escape did you very little good,\nReady,\" observed Mrs Seagrave, \"if you got over it so soon.\"\n\n\"Indeed, madam, it was not so; that was only the feeling which the first\nsight of the vessels under weigh for England produced upon me.  I can\nhonestly say that I was a better and more serious person.  The very next\nnight, when I was in my hammock, I prayed very fervently; and there\nhappened to be a very good old Scotchman on board, the second mate, who\ntalked very seriously to me, and pointed out how wonderful had been my\npreservation, and I felt it.  It was he who first read the Bible with\nme, and made me understand it, and, I may say, become fond of it.  I did\nmy duty on our passage home as a seaman before the mast, and the captain\nwas pleased with me.  The ship I was in was bound to Glasgow, and we\nparted company with the convoy at North Foreland, and arrived safe in\nport.  The captain took me to the owners, who paid me fifteen guineas\nfor my services during the voyage home; and as soon as I received the\nmoney, I set off for Newcastle as fast as I could.  I had taken a place\non the outside of the coach, and I entered into conversation with a\ngentleman who sat next to me.  I soon found out that he belonged to\nNewcastle, and I first inquired if Mr Masterman, the ship-builder, was\nstill alive.  He told me that he had been dead about three months.  `And\nto whom did he leave his money?'  I asked, `for he was very rich, and\nhad no kin.'  `He had no relations,' replied the gentleman, `and he left\nall his money to build an hospital and almshouses.  He had a partner in\nhis business latterly, and he left the yard and all the stores to him, I\nbelieve, because he did not know whom to leave it to.  There was a lad\nwhom I knew for certain he intended to have adopted and to have made his\nheir--a lad of the name of Ready; but he ran away to sea, and has never\nbeen heard of since.  It is supposed that he was lost in a prize, for he\nwas traced so far.  Foolish boy that he was.  He might now have been a\nman of fortune.'\n\n\"`Very foolish indeed,' replied I.\n\n\"`Yes; but he has harmed more than himself.  His poor mother, who doted\nupon him, as soon as she heard that he was lost, pined away by degrees,\nand--'\n\n\"`You don't mean to say that she is dead?' interrupted I, seizing the\ngentleman by the arm.\n\n\"`Yes,' replied he, looking at me with surprise; `she died last year of\na broken heart.'\n\n\"I fell back on the luggage behind me, and should have fallen off the\ncoach if the gentleman had not held me.  He called to the coachman to\npull up the horses, and they took me down, and put me inside; and as the\ncoach rolled on, I cried as if my heart would break.\"\n\nReady appeared so much affected, that Mr Seagrave proposed that he\nshould leave off his history for the present.\n\n\"Thank you, sir, it will be better; for I feel my old eyes dim with\ntears, even now.  It's a dreadful thing in after-life to reflect upon,\nthat your foolish conduct has hastened the death of a most kind mother;\nbut so it was, William, and I give you the truth for your advantage.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40.\n\nA few mornings afterwards, Juno came in before breakfast with six eggs\nin her apron, which she had found in the hen-house.\n\n\"Look, Missy Seagrave--fowls lay eggs--soon have plenty--plenty for\nMaster William--make him well again--and plenty for chickens by and by.\"\n\n\"You haven't taken them all out of the nests, Juno; have you?\"\n\n\"No; leave one in each nest for hen to see.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we will keep them for William, and I hope, as you say, they\nwill make him strong again.\"\n\n\"I am getting quite strong now, mother,\" replied William; \"I think it\nwould be better to leave the eggs for the hens to sit upon.\"\n\n\"No, no, William; your health is of more consequence than having early\nchickens.\"\n\nFor a few days Mr Seagrave and Ready were employed at the garden\nclearing away the weeds, which had begun to sprout up along with the\nseeds which had been sown; during which time William recovered very\nfast.  The two first days, Juno brought in three or four eggs regularly;\nbut on the third day there were none to be found.  On the fourth day the\nhens appeared also not to have laid, much to the surprise of Mrs\nSeagrave; as when hens commence laying eggs they usually continue.  On\nthe fifth morning, when they sat down to breakfast, Master Tommy did not\nmake his appearance, and Mrs Seagrave asked where he was.\n\n\"I suspect, madam,\" said Old Ready, laughing, \"that Tommy will not come\neither to his breakfast or his dinner to-day.\"\n\n\"What can you mean, Ready?\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Why, madam, I will tell you.  I thought it very odd that there were no\neggs, and I thought it probable that the hens might have laid astray; so\nI went about yesterday evening to search.  I could not find any eggs,\nbut I found the egg-shells, hid under some cocoa-nut leaves; and I\nargued, that if an animal, supposing there was any on the island, had\ntaken the eggs, it would not have been so careful to hide the\negg-shells.  So, this morning, I fastened up the door of the hen-house,\nand only left open the little sliding door, by which the fowls go in to\nroost; and then, after you were up, I watched behind the trees, and saw\nTommy come out, and go to the hen-house.  He tried the door, and finding\nit fast, crept into the hen-house by the little sliding-door.  As soon\nas he was in I let down the slide, and fastened it with a nail; so there\nhe is, caught in his own trap.\"\n\n\"And there shall he remain all day, the little glutton!\" said Mr\nSeagrave.\n\n\"Yes, it will serve him right,\" replied Mrs Seagrave; \"and be a lesson\nto him.\"\n\nMr Seagrave, Ready, and William, as usual, went down to their work;\nMrs Seagrave and Juno, with little Caroline, were busy indoors.  Tommy\nremained very quiet for an hour, when he commenced roaring; but it was\nof no use, no one paid any attention to him.  At dinner-time he began to\nroar again, but with as little success: it was not till the evening that\nthe door of the hen-house was opened, and Tommy permitted to come out.\nHe looked very foolish; and sat down in a corner without speaking.\n\n\"Well, Tommy, how many eggs did you suck to-day?\" said Ready.\n\n\"Tommy won't suck eggs any more,\" said the urchin.\n\n\"No, you had better not,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"or you will find, in\nthe end, that you will have less to eat, instead of more, as you have\nthis day.\"\n\nTommy waited very quietly and very sulkily till supper was ready, when\nhe made up for lost time.  After which Ready continued his narrative.\n\n\"I told you, William, that I was informed by the gentleman on the coach\nthat my mother had died of a broken heart, in consequence of my supposed\ndeath.  I was in agony until I arrived at Newcastle, where I could\nascertain all the facts connected with her decease.  When the coach\nstopped, the gentleman, who had remained outside, came to the coach\ndoor, and said to me, `If I mistake not, you are Masterman Ready, who\nran away to sea; are you not?'  `Yes, sir,' replied I, very sorrowfully,\n`I am.'  `Well, my man,' said he, `cheer up; when you went away you were\nyoung and thoughtless, and certainly had no idea that you would have\ndistressed your mother as you did.  It was not your going to sea, but\nthe report of your death, which preyed so much upon her mind; and that\nwas not your fault.  You must come with me, as I have something to say\nto you.'\n\n\"`I will call upon you to-morrow, sir,' replied I; `I cannot do anything\nuntil I talk to the neighbours and visit my poor mother's grave.  It is\nvery true that I did not intend to distress my mother; and that the\nreport of my death was no fault of mine.  But I cannot help feeling\nthat, if I had not been so thoughtless, she would be still alive and\nhappy.'  The gentleman gave me his address, and I promised to call upon\nhim next morning.  I then went to the house my mother used to live in.\nI knew that she was not there; yet I was disappointed and annoyed when I\nheard merry laughter within.  I looked in, for the door was open; in the\ncorner where my mother used to sit, there was a mangle, and two women\nbusily at work; others were ironing at a large table; and when they\ncried out to me, `What do you want?' and laughed at me, I turned away in\ndisgust, and went to a neighbouring cottage, the inmates of which had\nbeen very intimate with my mother.  I found the wife at home, but she\ndid not know me; and I told her who I was.  She had attended my mother\nduring her illness, till the day of her death; and she told me all I\nwished to know.  It was some little relief to my mind to hear that my\npoor mother could not have lived, as she had an incurable cancer; but at\nthe same time the woman told me that I was ever in her thoughts, and\nthat my name was the last word on her lips.  She also said that Mr\nMasterman had been very kind to my mother, and that she had wanted\nnothing.  I then asked her to show me where my mother had been buried.\nShe put on her bonnet, and led me to the grave, and then, at my request,\nshe left me.  I seated myself down by the mound of turf which covered\nher, and long and bitterly did I weep her loss and pray for forgiveness.\n\n\"It was quite dark when I left the spot and went back to the cottage of\nthe kind woman who had attended my mother.  I conversed with her and her\nhusband till late, and then, as they offered me a bed, I remained with\nthem that night.  Next morning I went to keep my appointment with the\ngentleman whom I had met in the coach: I found by the brass plate on the\ndoor that he was a lawyer.  He desired me to sit down, and then he\nclosed the door carefully, and having asked me many questions, to\nascertain if I was really Masterman Ready, he said he was the person\nemployed at Mr Masterman's death, and that he had found a paper which\nwas of great consequence, as it proved that the insurance of the vessel\nwhich had belonged to my father and Mr Masterman, and which had been\nlost, had not been made on Mr Masterman's share only, but upon my\nfather's as well, and that Mr Masterman had defrauded my mother.  He\nsaid he had found the paper in a secret drawer some time after Mr\nMasterman's death, and that my mother being dead, and I being supposed\nto be dead, he did not see any use in making known so disagreeable a\ncircumstance; but that, now I had re-appeared, it was his duty so to do,\nand that he would arrange the matter for me, if I pleased, with the\ncorporation of the town, to whom all Mr Masterman's property had been\nleft in trust to build an hospital and almshouses.  He said that the\ninsurance on the vessel was three thousand pounds, and that one-third of\nthe vessel belonged to my father, so that a thousand pounds were due to\nhim, which the interest for so many years would increase to above two\nthousand pounds.  This was good news for me, and you may suppose I\nreadily agreed to all he proposed.  He set to work at once, and having\ncalled together the mayor and corporation of the town, and proved the\ndocument, they immediately agreed that I was entitled to the money, and\nthat it should be paid to me without any contest.  Thus you see, Master\nWilliam, was a new temptation thrown in my way.\"\n\n\"How do you mean a temptation?  It surely was very fortunate, Ready,\"\nsaid William.\n\n\"Yes, William, it was, as people say, fortunate, according to the ideas\nof the world; every one congratulated me, and I was myself so inflated\nwith my good fortune, that I forgot all the promises of amendment, all\nthe vows of leading a good life, which I made over my poor mother's\ngrave.  Now do you perceive why I called it a temptation, Master\nWilliam?\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"riches and prosperity in this world\nprove often the greatest of temptations; it is adversity that chastens\nand amends us, and which draws us to God.\"\n\n\"As soon as the money was in my own hands,\" continued Ready, \"I began to\nsquander it away in all manner of folly.  Fortunately, I had not\nreceived it more than ten days, when the Scotch second mate came like a\nguardian angel to save me.  As soon as I had made known to him what had\ntaken place, he reasoned with me, pointed out to me that I had an\nopportunity of establishing myself for life, and proposed that I should\npurchase a part of a vessel, on condition that I was captain of her.  I\nliked this idea very much, and being convinced that I had been making a\nfool of myself, I resolved to take his advice; but one thing only\nrestrained me: I was still very young, not more than twenty years old;\nand although I could navigate at one time, I had latterly paid no\nattention.  I told Sanders this, and he replied, that if I would take\nhim as my first mate, that difficulty would be got over, as he could\nnavigate well, and that I could learn to do so in the first voyage; so\nall was arranged.\n\n\"Fortunately, I had not spent above one hundred pounds of the money.  I\nset off for Glasgow in company with Sanders, and he busied himself very\nhard in looking about for a vessel that would suit.  At last, he found\nthat there was one ready for launching, which, in consequence of the\nfailure of the house for which it was built, was to be sold.  He made\ninquiries, and having found who was likely to purchase her--that it was\na very safe and respectable firm--he made a proposal for me that I\nshould take one-fourth share of her, and command her.  As Sanders was\nvery respectable, and well known to be a steady man, his recommendation\nwas attended to so far that the parties wished to see and speak to me.\nThey were satisfied with me, young as I was, and the bargain was made.\nI paid down my two thousand pounds for my share, and as soon as the\nvessel was launched, was very busy with Sanders, whom I had chosen as\nfirst mate, in fitting her out.  The house which had purchased her with\nme was a West India firm, and the ship was of course intended for the\nWest India trade.  I had two or three hundred pounds left, after I had\npaid my share of the vessel, and this I employed in purchasing a venture\non my own account, and providing nautical instruments, etcetera.  I also\nfitted myself out, for you see, William, although Sanders had persuaded\nme to be rational, I was still puffed up with pride at the idea of being\ncaptain of my own ship; it was too great a rise for one who had just\nbefore been a lad in the mizen-top of a man-of-war.  I dressed myself\nvery smart--wore white shirts, and rings on my fingers.  Indeed, as\ncaptain and part owner of a fine vessel, I was considered as somebody,\nand was often invited to the table of the other owners of the vessel.  I\nwas well off, for my pay was ten pounds a month, independent of what my\nown venture might produce, and my quarter-share of the profits of the\nvessel.  This may be considered as the most prosperous portion of my\nlife; and so, if you please, we will leave off here for to-night, for I\nmay as well tell you at once that it did not last very long.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 41.\n\nFor several days after, they were employed in clearing away the stumps\nof the cocoa-nut trees in the winding path to the storehouse; and as\nsoon as that work was finished, Ready put up a lightning-conductor at\nthe side of the storehouse, like the one which he had put up near to the\ncottage.  They had now got through all the work that they had arranged\nto do during the rainy season.  The ewes had lambed, but both the sheep\nand the goats began to suffer for want of pasture.  For a week they had\nno rain, and the sun burst out very powerfully; and Ready was of opinion\nthat the rainy season was now over.  William had become quite strong\nagain, and he was very impatient that they should commence the survey of\nthe island.  After a great deal of consultation, it was at last settled,\nthat Ready and William should make the first survey to the southward,\nand then return and report what they had discovered.  This was decided\nupon on the Saturday evening, and on the Monday morning they were to\nstart.  The knapsacks were got ready, and well filled with boiled salt\npork, and flat cakes of bread.  They were each to have a musket and\nammunition, and a blanket was folded up to carry on the shoulders, that\nthey might sleep on it at night.  Ready did not forget his compass, or\nthe small axes, for them to blaze the trees as they went through the\nwood.\n\nThe whole of Saturday was occupied in making their preparations.  After\nsupper, Ready said, \"Now, William, before we start on our travels, I\nthink I may as well wind up my history.  I haven't a great deal more to\ntell, as my good fortune did not last long; and after my remaining so\nlong in a French prison, my life was one continued chapter of from bad\nto worse.  Our ship was soon ready, and we sailed with convoy for\nBarbadoes.  Sanders proved a good navigator, and from him, before we\narrived at Barbadoes, I gained all the knowledge which I required to\nenable me to command and navigate my vessel.  Sanders attempted to renew\nour serious conversation, but my property had made me vain; and now that\nI felt I could do without his assistance, I not only kept him at a\ndistance, but assumed the superior.  This was a very ungrateful return\nfor his kindness to me; but it is too often the case in this world.\nSanders was very much annoyed, and on our arrival at Barbadoes, he told\nme that it was his intention to quit the vessel.  I replied very\nhaughtily, that he might do as he pleased; the fact is, I was anxious to\nget rid of him, merely because I was under obligations to him.  Well,\nsir, Sanders left me, and I felt quite happy at his departure.  My ship\nwas soon with a full cargo of sugar on board of her, and we waited for\nconvoy to England.  When at Barbadoes, I had an opportunity to buy four\nbrass guns, which I mounted on deck, and had a good supply of ammunition\non board.  I was very proud of my vessel, as she had proved in the\nvoyage out to be a very fast sailer: indeed, she sailed better than some\nof the men-of-war which convoyed us; and now that I had guns on board, I\nconsidered myself quite safe from any of the enemies' privateers.  While\nwe were waiting for convoy, which was not expected for a fortnight, it\nblew a very heavy gale, and my ship, as well as others, dragged their\nanchors, and were driven out of Carlisle Bay.  We were obliged to make\nsail to beat into the bay again, it still blowing very fresh.  What with\nbeing tired waiting so long for convoy, and the knowledge that arriving\nbefore the other West Indiamen would be very advantageous, I made up my\nmind that, instead of beating up into the bay again, I would run for\nEngland without protection, trusting to the fast sailing of my vessel\nand the guns which I had on board.  I forgot at the time that the\ninsurance on the vessel was made in England as `sailing with convoy,'\nand that my sailing without would render the insurance void, if any\nmisfortune occurred.  Well, sir, I made sail for England, and for three\nweeks everything went on well.  We saw very few vessels, and those which\ndid chase us could not come up with us; but as we were running with a\nfair wind up channel, and I had made sure of being in port before night,\na French privateer hove in sight and gave chase.  We were obliged to\nhaul our wind, and it blowing very fast, we carried away our main-top\nmast.  This accident was fatal; the privateer came alongside of us and\nlaid us by the board, and that night I was in a French prison, and, I\nmay say, a pauper; for the insurance of the vessel was void, from my\nhaving sailed without convoy.  I felt that I had no one to thank but\nmyself for the unfortunate position I was in; at all events, I was\nseverely punished, for I remained a prisoner for nearly six years.  I\ncontrived to escape with three or four others; we suffered dreadfully,\nand at last arrived in England, in a Swedish vessel, without money, or\neven clothes that would keep out the weather.  Of course, I had nothing\nto do but to look out for a berth on board of a ship, and I tried for\nthat of second mate, but without success; I was too ragged and looked\ntoo miserable; so I determined, as I was starving, to go before the\nmast.  There was a fine vessel in the port; I went on board to offer\nmyself; the mate went down to the captain, who came on deck, and who\nshould he be but Sanders?  I hoped that he would not remember me, but he\ndid immediately, and held out his hand.  I never did feel so ashamed in\nmy life as I did then.  Sanders perceived it, and asked me down into the\ncabin.  I then told him all that had happened, and he appeared to forget\nthat I had behaved so ill to him; he offered me a berth on board, and\nmoney in advance to fit me out.  But if he would not remember my\nconduct, I could not forget it, and I told him so, and begged his\nforgiveness.  Well, sir, that good man, as long as he lived, was my\nfriend.  I became his second mate before he died, and we were again very\nintimate.  My misfortunes had humbled me, and I once more read the Bible\nwith him; and I have, I trust, done so ever since.  When he died, I\ncontinued second mate for some time, and then was displaced.  Since\nthat, I have always been as a common seaman on board of different\nvessels; but I have been well treated and respected, and I may add, I\nhave not been unhappy, for I felt that property would have only led me\ninto follies, and have made me forget, that in this world we are to live\nso as to prepare ourselves for another.  Now, William, you have the\nhistory of Masterman Ready; and I hope that there are portions of it\nwhich may prove useful to you.  To-morrow we must be off betimes, and as\nwe are all to breakfast early together, why, I think the sooner we go to\nbed the better.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"William, dear, bring me the Bible.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 42.\n\nThey were all up early the next morning, and breakfasted at an early\nhour.  The knapsacks and guns, and the other requisites for the journey,\nwere all prepared; William and Ready rose from the table, and taking an\naffectionate leave of Mr and Mrs Seagrave, they started on their\njourney.  The sun was shining brilliantly, and the weather had become\nwarm; the ocean in the distance gleamed brightly, as its waters danced,\nand the cocoa-nut trees moved their branches gracefully to the breeze.\nThey set off in high spirits, and having called the two shepherd dogs,\nand driven back Vixen, who would have joined the party, they passed the\nstorehouse, and ascending the hill on the other side, they got their\nhatchets ready to blaze the trees; and Ready having set his course by\nhis pocket compass, they were fairly on their way.  For some time they\ncontinued to cut the bark of the trees with their hatchets, without\nspeaking, and then Ready stopped again to look at his compass.\n\n\"I think the wood is thicker here than ever, Ready,\" observed William.\n\n\"Yes, sir, it is; but I suspect we are now in the thickest part of it,\nright in the middle of the island; however, we shall soon see.  We must\nkeep a little more away to the southward.  We had better get on as fast\nas we can.  We shall have less work by and by, and then we can talk\nbetter.\"\n\nFor half-an-hour they continued their way through the wood, and, as\nReady had observed, the trees became more distant from each other;\nstill, however, they could not see anything before them but the stems of\nthe cocoa-nuts.  It was hard work, chopping the trees every second, and\ntheir foreheads were moist with the exertion.\n\n\"I think we had better pull up for a few minutes, William; you will be\ntired.\"\n\n\"I have not been so used to exercise, Ready, and therefore I feel it\nmore,\" replied William, wiping his face with his handkerchief.  \"I\nshould like to stop a few minutes.  How long do you think it will be\nbefore we are out of the wood?\"\n\n\"Not half-an-hour more, sir, I should think; even before that, perhaps.\"\n\n\"What do you expect to find, Ready?\"\n\n\"That's a difficult question to answer.  I can tell you what I hope to\nfind, which is, a good space of clear ground between the beach and the\nwood, where we may pasture our sheep and goats; and perhaps we may find\nsome other trees besides cocoa-nuts: at present, you know, we have seen\nonly them and the castor-oil beans, that Tommy took such a dose of.  You\nsee, William, there is no saying what new seeds may have been brought\nhere by birds, or by the winds and waves.\"\n\n\"But will those seeds grow?\"\n\n\"Yes, William; I have been told that seeds may remain hundreds of years\nunder-ground, and come up afterwards when exposed to the heat.\"\n\nThey continued their way, and had not walked for more than a quarter of\nan hour, when William cried out, \"I see the blue sky, Ready; we shall\nsoon be out; and glad shall I be, for my arm aches with chopping.\"\n\n\"I dare say it does, sir.  I am just as glad as you are, for I'm tired\nof marking the trees; however, we must continue to mark, or we shall not\nfind our way back when we want it.\"\n\nIn ten minutes more they were clear of the cocoa-nut grove, and found\nthemselves among brushwood higher than their heads; so that they could\nnot see how far they were from the shore.\n\n\"Well,\" said William, throwing down his hatchet, \"I'm glad that's over;\nnow let us sit down a little before we go any further.\"\n\n\"I'm of your opinion, sir,\" replied Ready, sitting down by the side of\nWilliam; \"I feel more tired to-day than I did when we first went through\nthe wood, after we set off from the cove.  I suppose it's the weather.\nCome back, dogs; lie down.\"\n\n\"The weather is very fine, Ready.\"\n\n\"Yes, now it is; but I meant to have said that the rainy season is very\ntrying to the health, and I suppose I have not recovered from it yet.\nYou have had a regular fever, and, of course, do not feel strong; but a\nman may have no fever, and yet his health suffer a great deal from it.\nI am an old man, William, and feel these things now.\"\n\n\"I think that before we go on, Ready, we had better have our dinner;\nthat will do us good.\"\n\n\"Well, we will take an early dinner, and we shall get rid of one bottle\nof water, at all events; indeed, I think that, as we must go back by the\nsame way we came, we may as well leave our knapsacks and everything but\nour guns under these trees; I dare say we shall sleep here too, for I\ntold Mr Seagrave positively not to expect us back to-night.  I did not\nlike to say so before your mother, she is so anxious about you.\"\n\nThey opened their knapsacks, and made their meal, the two dogs coming in\nfor their share; after which they again started on their discoveries.\nFor about ten minutes they continued to force their way through the\nthick and high bushes, till at last they broke out clear of them, and\nthen looked around them for a short time without speaking.  The sea was\nabout half a mile distant, and the intervening land was clear, with\nfresh blades of grass just bursting out of the earth, composing a fine\npiece of pasture of at least fifty acres, here and there broken with\nsmall patches of trees and brushwood; there was no sandy beach, but the\nrocks rose from the sea about twenty to thirty feet high, and were in\none or two places covered with something which looked as white as snow.\n\n\"Well, Ready,\" said William, \"there will be no want of pasture for our\nflock, even if it increases to ten times its number.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Ready, \"we are very fortunate, and have great reason to be\nthankful; this is exactly what we required; and now let us go on a\nlittle, and examine these patches of wood, and see what they are.  I see\na bright green leaf out there, which, if my eyes do not fail me, I have\nseen many a time before.\"  When they arrived at the clump of trees which\nReady had pointed out, he said, \"Yes, I was right.  Look there, this is\nthe banana; it is just bursting out now, and will soon be ten feet high,\nand bearing fruit which is excellent eating; besides which the stem is\ncapital fodder for the beasts.\"\n\n\"Here is a plant I never saw before,\" said William, pulling off a piece\nof it, and showing it to Ready.\n\n\"But I have, William.  It is what they call the bird's-eye pepper; they\nmake Cayenne pepper out of it.  Look, the pods are just formed; it will\nbe useful to us in cooking, as we have no pepper left.  You see,\nWilliam, we must have some birds on the island; at least it is most\nprobable, for all the seeds of these plants and trees must have been\nbrought here by them.  The banana and the pepper are the food of many\nbirds.  What a quantity of bananas are springing up in this spot; there\nwill be a little forest of them in a few weeks.\"\n\n\"What is that rough-looking sort of shrub out there, Ready?\"\n\n\"I can't see so well as you, William, so let us walk up to it.  Oh, I\nknow it now; it is what they call the prickly pear in the West Indies.\nI am very glad to have found that, for it will be very useful to us.\"\n\n\"Is it good eating, Ready?\"\n\n\"Not particularly; and the little spikes run into your fingers, and are\nvery difficult to get rid of; but it is not bad by way of a change.  No,\nthe use it will be to us is to hedge in our garden, and protect it from\nthe animals; it makes a capital fence, and grows very fast, and without\ntrouble.  Now let us go on to that patch of trees, and see what they\nare.\"\n\n\"What is this plant, Ready?\"\n\n\"I don't know, William.\"\n\n\"Then I think I had better make a collection of all those you don't\nknow, and take them back to father; he is a good botanist.\"\n\nWilliam pulled a branch of the plant off, and carried it with him.  On\ntheir arrival at the next patch of trees, Ready looked at them\nsteadfastly for some time.\n\n\"I ought to know that tree,\" said he.  \"I have often seen it in hot\ncountries.  Yes, it's the guava.\"\n\n\"What! is it the fruit they make guava jelly of?\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, the very same.\"\n\n\"Let us now walk in the direction of those five or six trees,\" said\nWilliam; \"and from there down to the rocks; I want to find out how it is\nthat they are so white.\"\n\n\"Be it so, if you wish,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"Why, Ready, what noise is that?  Hark! such a chattering, it must be\nmonkeys.\"\n\n\"No, they are not monkeys; but I'll tell you what they are, although I\ncannot see them; they are parrots--I know their noise well.  You see,\nWilliam, it's not very likely that monkeys should get here, but birds\ncan, and it is the birds that we have to thank for the bananas and\nguavas, and other fruits we may find here.\"\n\nAs soon as they came under the trees, there was a great rioting and\nfluttering, and then away flew, screaming as loud as they could, a flock\nof about three hundred parrots, their beautiful green and blue feathers\nglistening in the beams of the sun.\n\n\"I told you so; well, we'll have some capital pies out of them,\nWilliam.\"\n\n\"Pies! do they make good pies, Ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, excellent; and very often have I had a good dinner from one in the\nWest Indies, and in South America.  Stop, let us come a little this way;\nI see a leaf which I should like to examine.\"\n\n\"The ground is very swampy just here, Ready; is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes; there's plenty of water below, I don't doubt.  So much the better\nfor the animals; we must dig some pools when they come here.\n\n\"Oh!  I thought I was not wrong.  Look! this is the best thing I have\nfound yet--we now need not care so much about potatoes.\"\n\n\"Why, what are they, Ready?\"\n\n\"Yams, which they use instead of potatoes in the West Indies.  Indeed,\npotatoes do not remain potatoes long, when planted in hot climates.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, Ready?\"\n\n\"They turn into what they call sweet-potatoes, after one or two crops:\nyams are better things, in my opinion.\"\n\nAt this moment the dogs dashed among the broad yam leaves, and commenced\nbaying; there was a great rustling and snorting.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried William, who had been stooping down to examine the\nyam plant, and who was startled at the noise.\n\nReady laughed heartily.  \"It isn't the first time that they've made you\njump, William.\"\n\n\"Why, it's our pigs, isn't it?\" replied William.\n\n\"To be sure; they're in the yam patch, very busy feeding on them, I'll\nbe bound.\"\n\nReady gave a shout, and a grunting and rushing were heard among the\nbroad leaves, and, very soon, out rushed, instead of the six, about\nthirty pigs large and small; who, snorting and twisting their tails,\ngalloped away at a great rate, until they gained the cocoa-nut grove.\n\n\"How wild they are, Ready!\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, and they'll be wilder every day; but we must fence these yams from\nthem, or we shall get none ourselves.\"\n\n\"But they'll beat down the fence before it grows up.\"\n\n\"We must pale it with cocoa-nut palings, and plant the prickly pears\noutside.  Now, we'll go down to the sea-side.\"\n\nAs they neared the rocks, which were bare for about fifty yards from the\nwater's edge, Ready said, \"I can tell you now what those white patches\non the rocks are, William; they are the places where the sea-birds come\nto every year to make their nests, and bring up their young.  They\nalways come to the same place every year, if they are not disturbed.\"\nThey soon arrived at the spot, and found it white with the feathers of\nbirds, mixed up with dirt.\n\n\"I see no nests, Ready, nor the remains of any.\"\n\n\"No, they do not make any nests, further than scratching a round hole,\nabout half an inch deep, in the soil, and there they lay their eggs,\nsitting quite close to one another; they will soon be here, and begin to\nlay, and then we will come and take the eggs, if we want any, for they\nare not bad eating.\"\n\n\"Why, Ready, what a quantity of good things we have found out already!\nThis has been a very fortunate expedition of ours.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has; and we may thank God for his goodness, who thus provides\nfor us so plentifully in the wilderness.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Ready, I cannot help thinking that we ought to have built\nour house here.\"\n\n\"Not so, William; we have not the pure water, recollect, and we have not\nthe advantages of the sandy beach, where we have our turtle- and\nfish-pond.  No; we may feed our stock here; we may gather the fruit,\ntaking our share of it with the poor birds; we may get our yams, and\nevery other good provided for us; but our house and home must be where\nit is now.\"\n\n\"You are right, Ready; but it will be a long walk.\"\n\n\"Not when we are accustomed to it, and have made a beaten path; besides,\nwe may bring the boat round, perhaps.\"\n\nThen they walked along the sea-side for about a quarter of a mile, until\nthey came to where the rocks were not so high, and there they discovered\na little basin, completely formed in the rocks, with a narrow entrance.\n\n\"See, William, what a nice little harbour for our boat! we may here load\nit with yams and take it round to the bay, provided we can find an\nentrance through the reefs on the southern side of it, which we have not\nlooked for yet, because we have not required it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ready--it is, indeed, a nice, smooth little place for the boat.\nWhat is that thing on the bottom, there?\" said William, pointing in the\ndirection.\n\n\"That is a sea crawfish, quite as good eating as a lobster.  I wonder if\nI could make a lobster-pot; we should catch plenty, and very good they\nare.\"\n\n\"And what are those little rough things on the rock?\"\n\n\"They are a very nice little sort of oyster; not like those we have in\nEngland, but much better--they are so delicate.\"\n\n\"Why, Ready, we have two more good things for our table, again,\" replied\nWilliam; \"how rich we shall be!\"\n\n\"Yes; but we have to catch them, recollect: there is nothing to be had\nin this world without labour.\"\n\n\"Ready,\" said William, \"we have good three hours' daylight; suppose we\ngo back and tell what we have seen: my mother will be so glad to see\nus.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, William.  We have done well for one day; and may\nsafely go back again, and remain for another week.  There are no fruits\nat present, and all I care about are the yams; I should like to protect\nthem from the pigs.  But let us go home and talk the matter over with\nMr Seagrave.\"\n\nThey found out the spot where they had left their knapsacks and\nhatchets, and again took their path through the cocoa-nut trees,\nfollowing the blaze which they had made in the morning.  One hour before\nsunset they arrived at the house, where they found Mr and Mrs Seagrave\nsitting outside, and Juno standing on the beach with the two children,\nwho were amusing themselves with picking up the shells which were\nstrewed about.  William gave a very clear account of all they had seen,\nand showed his father the specimens of the plants which he had\ncollected.\n\n\"This,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"is a well-known plant; and I wonder Ready\ndid not recognise it; it is hemp.\"\n\n\"I never saw it except in the shape of rope,\" replied Ready.  \"I know\nthe seed well enough.\"\n\n\"Well, if we require it, I can tell you how to dress it,\" replied Mr\nSeagrave.  \"Now, William, what is the next?\"\n\n\"This odd-looking, rough thing.\"\n\n\"That's the egg-plant: it bears fruit of a blue colour.  I am told they\neat it in the hot countries.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, they do; they fry it with pepper and salt; they call it\nbringal.  I think it must be that.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt but you are right,\" replied Mr Seagrave.  \"Why,\nWilliam, you should know this.\"\n\n\"It is like the grape-vine.\"\n\n\"Yes, and it is so; it is the wild grape; we shall eat them by and bye.\"\n\n\"I have only one more, papa: what is this?\"\n\n\"You don't know it, because it has sprung up so high, William; but it is\nthe common mustard plant,--what we use in England, and is sold as\nmustard and cress.  I think you have now made a famous day's work of it;\nand we have much to thank God for.\"\n\nAs soon as they had returned to the house, a consultation was held as to\ntheir future proceedings; and, after some debate, it was agreed that it\nwould be advisable that they should take the boat out of the sand; and,\nas soon as it was ready, examine the reef on the southward, to see if\nthey could find a passage through it, as it would take a long while to\ngo round it; and, as soon as that was accomplished, Mr Seagrave, Ready,\nWilliam, and Juno should all go through the wood, carrying with them a\ntent to pitch on the newly-discovered piece of ground: and that they\nshould set up a flag-staff at the little harbour, to point out its\nposition.  Of course, that would be a hard day's work; but that they\nwould, nevertheless, return the same night, and not leave Mrs Seagrave\nalone with the children.  Having accomplished this, Ready and William\nwould then put the wheels and axle in the boat, and other articles\nrequired, such as saw, hatchets, and spades, and row round to the south\nside of the island, to find the little harbour.  As soon as they had\nlanded them, and secured the boat, they would then return by the path\nthrough the wood.\n\nThe next job would be to rail in the yam plantation to keep off the\npigs, and, at the same time, to drive the sheep and goats through the\nwood, that they might feed on the new pasture ground.  Ready and William\nwere then to cut down cocoa-nut trees sufficient for the paling, fix up\nthe posts, and when that was done, Mr Seagrave was to come to them and\nassist them in railing it in, and drawing the timber.  This they\nexpected would be all done in about a month; and during that time, as\nMrs Seagrave and Juno would be, for the greatest part of it, left at\nthe house, they were to employ themselves in clearing the garden of\nweeds, and making preparation for fencing it in.\n\nAs soon as this important work had been completed, the boat would return\nto the bay with a load of prickly pears for the garden fence, and then\nthey were to direct their attention to the stores which had been saved\nfrom the wreck, and were lying in the cove where they had first landed.\nWhen they had examined them, and brought round what were required, and\nsecured them in the storehouse, they would then have a regular survey of\nthe island by land and by water.  But man proposes and God disposes, as\nwill be shown by the interruption of their intended projects which we\nshall have to narrate in the ensuing chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 43.\n\nAs usual, Ready was the first up on the following morning, and having\ngreeted Juno, who followed him out of the house, he set off on his\naccustomed rounds, to examine into the stock and their other\npossessions.  He was standing in the garden at the point.  First he\nthought that it would be necessary to get ready some sticks for the\npeas, which were now seven or eight inches out of the ground; he had\nproceeded a little farther, to where the calivances, or French haricot\nbeans, had been sown, and had decided upon the propriety of hoeing up\nthe earth round them, as they were a very valuable article of food, that\nwould keep, and afford many a good dish during the rainy or winter\nseason.  He had gone on to ascertain if the cucumber seeds had shown\nthemselves above-ground, and was pleased to find that they were doing\nwell.  He said to himself, \"We have no vinegar, that I know of, but we\ncan preserve them in salt and water, as they do in Russia; it will be a\nchange, at all events;\" and then he raised his eyes and looked out to\nthe offing, and, as usual, scanned the horizon.  He thought he saw a\nship to the north-east, and he applied his telescope to his eye.  He was\nnot mistaken--it was a vessel.\n\nThe old man's heart beat quick; he dropped his telescope on his arm, and\nfetched some heavy breaths before he could recover from the effect of\nthis unexpected sight.  After a minute, he again put his telescope to\nhis eye, and then made her out to be a brig, under top-sails and\ntop-gallant sails, steering directly for the island.\n\nReady walked to the rocky point, from which they fished, and sat down to\nreflect.  Could it be that the vessel had been sent after them, or that\nshe had by mere chance come among the islands?  He decided after a short\ntime that it must be chance, for none could know that they were saved,\nmuch less that they were on the island.  Her steering towards the island\nmust then be either that she required water or something else; perhaps\nshe would alter her course and pass by them.  \"At all events,\" thought\nthe old man, \"we are in the hands of God, who will, at his own time and\nin his own way, do with us as he thinks fit.  I will not at present say\nanything to Mr and Mrs Seagrave.  It would be cruel to raise hopes\nwhich might end in disappointment.  A few hours will decide.  And yet I\ncannot do without help--I must trust William.\"\n\nReady rose, examined the vessel with his telescope, and then walked\ntowards the house.  William was up, and the remainder of the family were\nstirring.\n\n\"William,\" said Ready to him, as they walked away from the house, \"I\nhave a secret to tell you, which you will at once see the necessity of\nnot telling to anyone at present.  A few hours will decide the\nquestion.\"  William readily gave his promise.  \"There is a vessel off\nthe island; she may be the means of rescuing us, or she may pass without\nseeing us.  It would be too cruel a disappointment to your father and\nmother, if the latter were the case.\"\n\nWilliam stared at Ready, and for a moment could not speak, his\nexcitement was so great.\n\n\"Oh, Ready, how grateful I am!  I trust that we may be taken away, for\nyou have no idea how my poor father suffers in silence--and so does my\nmother.\"\n\n\"I know it, William, I know it, and it is natural; they do their best to\ncontrol their yearnings, and they can do no more.  But now we must be\nquick, and at work before breakfast.  But stop, I will show you the\nvessel.\"\n\nReady caught the vessel in the field of the telescope, which he leant\nagainst the trunk of a cocoa-nut, and William put his eye to the glass.\n\n\"Do you see her?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Ready, and she is coming this way.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is steering right for the island.  I will put the telescope\ndown here, and we will go about our work.\"\n\nWilliam and Ready went to the storehouse for the axe.  Ready selected a\nvery slight cocoa-nut tree nearest to the beach, which he cut down, and\nas soon as the top was taken off with the assistance of William he\ncarried it down to the point.\n\n\"Now, William, go for a shovel and dig a hole here, that we may fix it\nup as a flag-staff.  When all is ready, I will go for a small block and\nsome rope for halyards to hoist up the flags as soon as the vessel is\nlikely to see them.  At breakfast-time, I shall propose that you and I\nget the boat out of the sand and examine her, and give Mr Seagrave some\nwork indoors.\"\n\n\"But the flags, Ready; they are round my mother's bed.  How shall we get\nthem?\"\n\n\"Suppose I say that it is time that the house should be well cleaned,\nand that the canvas hangings of the beds should be taken out to be aired\nthis fine day.  Ask your father to take the direction of the work while\nwe dig out the boat; that will employ them all inside the house.\"\n\n\"Yes, that will do, Ready.\"\n\nDuring breakfast-time, Ready observed that he intended to get the boat\nout of the sand, and that William should assist him.\n\n\"And what am I to do, Ready?\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Why, sir, I think, now that the rains are over, it would not be a bad\nthing if we were to air bedding, as they say at sea; it is a fine, warm\nday; and if all the bedding was taken out of the house and well shaken,\nand then left out to air, it would be a very good job over; for you see,\nsir, I have thought more than once that the house does smell a little\nclose.\"\n\n\"It will be a very good thing, Ready,\" observed Mrs Seagrave; \"and, at\nthe same time, Juno and I will give the house a thorough cleaning and\nsweeping.\"\n\n\"Had we not better have the canvas screens down, and air them too?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ready; \"we had better air everything.  We will assist in\ntaking down the screens and flags, and spread them out to air, and then,\nif Mr Seagrave has no objection, we will leave him to superintend and\nassist Madam and Juno.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" replied Mr Seagrave.  \"We have done breakfast, and\nwill begin as soon as you please.\"\n\nReady and William took down the canvas screens and flags, and went out\nof the cottage with them; they spread out the canvas at some distance\nfrom the house, and then William went down to the beach with the flags,\nwhile Ready procured the block and small rope to hoist them up with.\n\nReady's stratagem answered well.  Without being perceived by those in\nthe cottage, the flag-staff was raised, and fixed in the ground, and the\nflags all ready for hoisting; then Ready and William returned to the\nfuel-stack, and each carried down as much stuff as they could hold, that\nthey might make a smoke to attract the notice of those on board of the\nvessel.  All this did not occupy much more than an hour, during which\nthe brig continued her course steadily towards the island.  When Ready\nfirst saw her the wind was light, but latterly the breeze had increased\nvery much, and at last the brig took in her top-gallant sails.  The\nhorizon behind the vessel, which had been quite clear, was now banked up\nwith clouds, and the waves curled in white foam over the reefs of rocks\nextending from the island.\n\n\"The breeze is getting up strong, William,\" said Ready, \"and she will\nsoon be down, if she is not frightened at the reefs, which she can see\nplainer now the water is rough, than she could before.\"\n\n\"I trust she will not be afraid,\" replied William.  \"How far do you\nthink she is off now?\"\n\n\"About five miles; not more.  The wind has hauled round more to the\nsouthward, and it is banking up fast, I see.  I fear that we shall have\nanother smart gale; however, it won't last long.  Come, let us hoist the\nflags; we must not lose a chance; the flags will blow nice and clear for\nthem to see them.\"\n\nWilliam and Ready hoisted up the ensign first, and below it the flag,\nwith the ship's name, Pacific, in large letters upon it.  \"Now then,\"\nsaid Ready, as he made fast the halyards, \"let us strike a light and\nmake a smoke; that will attract their notice.\"\n\nAs soon as the cocoa-nut leaves were lighted, Ready and William threw\nwater upon them, so as to damp them and procure a heavy column of smoke.\nThe vessel approached rapidly, and they were watching her in silent\nsuspense, when they perceived Mr and Mrs Seagrave, Juno carrying\nAlbert, with Tommy and Caroline running down as fast as they could to\nthe beach.  The fact was, that Tommy, tired of work, had gone out of the\nhouse and walked towards the beach; there he perceived, first, the flags\nhoisted, and then he detected the vessel off the island.  He immediately\nran back to the house, crying out, \"Papa!  Mamma!  Captain Osborn come\nback--come back in a big ship.\"  At this announcement, Mr and Mrs\nSeagrave ran out of the house, perceived the vessel and the flags\nflying, and ran as fast as they could down to where William and Ready\nwere standing by the flag-staff.\n\n\"Oh!  Ready, why did you not tell us this before?\" exclaimed Mr\nSeagrave.\n\n\"I wish you had not known it now, sir,\" replied Ready; \"but, however, it\ncan't be helped; it was done out of kindness, Mr Seagrave.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed it was, papa.\"\n\nMrs Seagrave dropped down on the rock, and burst into tears.  Mr\nSeagrave was equally excited.\n\n\"Does she see us, Ready?\" exclaimed he at last.\n\n\"No, sir, not yet, and I waited till she did, before I made it known to\nyou,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"She is altering her course, Ready,\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, sir, she has hauled to the wind; she is afraid of coming too near\nto the reefs.\"\n\n\"Surely she is not leaving us!\" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"No, madam; but she does not see us yet.\"\n\n\"She does! she does!\" cried William, throwing up his hat; \"see, she\nhoists her ensign.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir; she does see us.  Thanks be to God!\"\n\nMr Seagrave embraced his wife, who threw herself sobbing into his arms,\nkissed his children with rapture, and wrung old Ready's hand.  He was\nalmost frantic with joy.  William was equally delighted.\n\nAs soon as they were a little more composed, Ready observed: \"Mr\nSeagrave, that they have seen us is certain, and what we must now do is\nto get our own boat out of the sand.  We know the passage through the\nreefs, and they do not.  I doubt if they will, however, venture to send\na boat on shore, until the wind moderates a little.  You see, sir, it is\nblowing up very strong just now.\"\n\n\"But you don't think it will blow harder, Ready?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say, sir, that I do.  It looks very threatening to the\nsouthward, and until the gale is over, they will not venture near an\nisland so surrounded with rocks.  It would be very imprudent if they\ndid.  However, sir, a few hours will decide.\"\n\n\"But, surely,\" said Mrs Seagrave, \"even if it does blow, they will not\nleave the island without taking us off.  They will come after the gale\nis over.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, if they can, I do think they will; but God knows, some men\nhave hard hearts, and feel little for the misery of others.\"\n\nThe brig had, in the meantime, kept away again, as if she was running\nin; but very soon afterwards she hauled to the wind, with her head to\nthe northward, and stood away from the island.\n\n\"She is leaving us,\" exclaimed William, mournfully.\n\n\"Hard-hearted wretches!\" said Mr Seagrave, with indignation.\n\n\"You are wrong to say that, sir,\" replied Ready: \"excuse me, Mr\nSeagrave, for being so bold; but the fact is, that if I was in command\nof that vessel, I should do just as they have done.  The gale rises\nfast, and it would be very dangerous for them to remain where they now\nare.  It does not at all prove that they intend to leave us; they but\nconsult their own safety, and, when the gale is over, we shall, I trust,\nsee them again.\"\n\nNo reply was made to Ready's judicious remarks.  The Seagraves only saw\nthat the vessel was leaving them, and their hearts sank.  They watched\nher in silence, and as she gradually diminished to the view, so did\ntheir hopes depart from them.  The wind was now fierce, and a heavy\nsquall, with rain, obscured the offing, and the vessel was no longer to\nbe distinguished.  Mr Seagrave turned to his wife, and mournfully\noffered her his arm.  They walked away from the beach without speaking;\nthe remainder of the party, with the exception of old Ready, followed\nthem.  Ready remained some time with his eyes in the direction where the\nvessel was last seen.  At last he hauled down the ensign and flag, and,\nthrowing them over his shoulder, followed the disconsolate party to the\nhouse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 44.\n\nWhen Ready arrived, he found them all plunged in such deep distress,\nthat he did not consider it advisable to say anything.  The evening\nclosed in; it was time to retire.  The countenance of Mr Seagrave was\nnot only gloomy, but morose.  The hour for retiring to rest had long\npassed when Ready broke the silence by saying, \"Surely, you do not\nintend to sit up all night, Mr Seagrave?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! there's no use sitting up now,\" replied Mr Seagrave, rising up\nimpatiently.  \"Come, my dear, let us go to bed.\"\n\nMrs Seagrave rose, and retired behind the canvas screen.  Her husband\nseemed as if he was about to follow her, when Ready, without speaking,\nlaid the Bible on the table before him.  Mr Seagrave did not appear to\nnotice it; but William touched his father's arm, pointed to the book,\nand then went inside of the screen, and led out his mother.\n\n\"God forgive me!\" exclaimed Mr Seagrave.  \"In my selfishness and\ndiscontent I had forgotten--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you had forgotten those words, `Come unto me, all ye who are\nweary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'\"\n\n\"I am ashamed of myself,\" said Mrs Seagrave, bursting into tears.\n\nMr Seagrave opened the Bible, and read the psalm.  As soon as he had\nclosed the book, \"good night\" were all the words that passed, and they\nall retired to rest.\n\nDuring the night, the wind howled and the rain beat down.  The children\nslept soundly, but Mr and Mrs Seagrave, Ready, and William were awake\nduring the whole of the night, listening to the storm, and occupied with\ntheir own thoughts.\n\nReady was dressed before daylight, and out on the beach before the sun\nhad risen.  The gale was at its height; and after a careful survey with\nhis telescope, he could see nothing of the vessel.  He remained on the\nbeach till breakfast-time, when he was summoned by William, and returned\nto the house.  He found Mr and Mrs Seagrave up, and more composed than\nthey were the evening before; and they welcomed him warmly.\n\n\"I fear, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"that you have no good news for us.\"\n\n\"No, sir; nor can you expect any good news until after the gale is over.\nThe vessel could not remain here during the gale--that is certain; and\nthere is no saying what the effects of the gale may be.  She may lie to,\nand not be far from us when the gale is over; or she may be obliged to\nscud before the gale, and run some hundred miles from us.  Then comes\nthe next chance.  I think, by her running for the island, that she was\nshort of water; the question is, then, whether she may not find it\nnecessary to run for the port she is bound to, or water at some other\nplace.  A captain of a vessel is bound to do his best for the owners.\nAt the same time I do think, that if she can with propriety come back\nfor us she will.  The question is, first, whether she can; and,\nsecondly, whether the captain is a humane man, and will do so at his own\ninconvenience.\"\n\n\"There is but poor comfort in all that,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"It is useless holding out false hopes, sir,\" replied Ready; \"but even\nif the vessel continues her voyage, we have much to be thankful for.\"\n\n\"In what, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, no one knew whether we were in existence or not, and probably\nwe never should have been searched for; but now we have made it known,\nand by the ship's name on the flag they know who we are, and, if they\narrive safe in port, will not fail to communicate the intelligence to\nyour friends.  Is not that a great deal to be thankful for?  We may not\nbe taken off by this vessel, but we have every hope that another will be\nsent out to us.\"\n\n\"Very true, Ready; I ought to have seen that before; but my despair and\ndisappointment were yesterday so great, that it almost took away my\nreason.\"\n\nThe gale continued during the day, and showed no symptoms of abatement,\nwhen they again retired for the night.  The following day Ready was up\nearly, as usual, and William accompanied him to the beach.\n\n\"I don't think that it blows so hard as it did, Ready.\"\n\n\"No, William, it does not; the gale is breaking, and by night, I have no\ndoubt, will be over.  It is, however, useless looking for the vessel, as\nshe must be a long way from this.  It would take her a week, perhaps, to\ncome back to us if she was to try to do so, unless the wind should\nchange to the northward or westward.\"\n\n\"Ready!  Ready!\" exclaimed William, pointing to the south-east part of\nthe reef; \"what is that?  Look! it's a boat.\"\n\nReady put his telescope to his eye.  \"It's a canoe, William, and there\nare people in it.\"\n\n\"Why, where can they have come from?  See! they are among the breakers;\nthey will be lost.  Let us go towards them, Ready.\"\n\nThey hastened along the beach to the spot nearest to where the canoe was\ntossing on the surf, and watched it as it approached the shore.\n\n\"William, this canoe must have been blown off from the large island,\nwhich lies out there;\" and Ready again looked through his telescope:\n\"there are two people in it, and they are islanders.  Poor things! they\nstruggle hard for their lives, and seem much exhausted; but they have\npassed through the most dangerous part of the reef.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied William, \"they will soon be in smoother water; but the\nsurf on the beach is very heavy.\"\n\n\"They won't mind that, if their strength don't fail them--they manage\nthe canoe beautifully.\"\n\nDuring this conversation the canoe had rapidly come towards the land.\nIn a moment or two afterwards, it passed through the surf and grounded\non the beach.  The two people in it had just strength enough left to\npaddle through the surf, and then they dropped down in the bottom of the\ncanoe, quite exhausted.\n\n\"Let's drag the canoe higher up, William.  Poor creatures! they are\nnearly dead.\"\n\nWhile dragging it up, Ready observed that the occupants were both women:\ntheir faces were tattooed all over; otherwise they were young, and might\nhave been good-looking.\n\n\"Shall I run up and get something for them, Ready?\"\n\n\"Do, William; ask Juno to give you some of whatever there is for\nbreakfast; anything warm.\"\n\nWilliam soon returned with some thin oatmeal porridge, which Juno had\nbeen preparing for breakfast; and a few spoonfuls being forced down the\nthroats of the two natives they gradually revived.  William then left\nReady, and went up to acquaint his father and mother with this\nunexpected event.\n\nWilliam soon returned with Mr Seagrave, and as the women were now able\nto sit up, they hauled up the canoe as far as they could, to prevent her\nbeing beat to pieces.  They found nothing in the canoe, except a piece\nof matting and the two paddles which had been used by the natives.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said Ready, \"it is very clear that these two poor women,\nhaving been left in charge of the canoe, have been blown off from the\nshore of one of the islands to the south-east; they must have been\ncontending with the gale ever since the day before yesterday, and, as it\nappears, without food or water.  It's a mercy that they gained this\nisland.\"\n\n\"It is so,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"but to tell the truth, I am not over\npleased at their arrival.  It proves what we were not sure of before,\nthat we have very near neighbours, who may probably pay us a very\nunwelcome visit.\"\n\n\"That may be, sir,\" replied Ready; \"still these two poor creatures being\nthrown on shore here does not make the matter worse, or the danger\ngreater.  Perhaps it may turn to our advantage; for if these women learn\nto speak English before any other islanders visit us, they will\ninterpret for us, and be the means, perhaps, of saving our lives.\"\n\n\"Would their visit be so dangerous, then, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, a savage is a savage, and, like a child, wishes to obtain\nwhatever he sees; especially he covets what he may turn to use, such as\niron, etcetera.  If they came, and we concealed a portion, and gave up\nthe remainder of our goods, we might escape; but still there is no\ntrusting to them, and I would infinitely prefer defending ourselves\nagainst numbers to trusting to their mercy.\"\n\n\"But how can we defend ourselves against a multitude?\"\n\n\"We must be prepared, sir: if we can fortify ourselves, with our muskets\nwe would be more than a match for hundreds.\"\n\nMr Seagrave turned away.  After a pause he said, \"It is not very\npleasant to be now talking of defending ourselves against savages, when\nwe hoped two days ago to be leaving the island.  Oh, that that brig\nwould make its appearance again!\"\n\n\"The wind is going down fast, sir,\" observed Ready; \"it will be fine\nweather before the evening.  We may look out for her; at all events, for\nthe next week I shall not give up all hopes.\"\n\n\"A whole week, Ready!  Alas! how true it is, that hope deferred maketh\nthe heart sick.\"\n\n\"It is a severe trial, Mr Seagrave; but we must submit when we are\nchastened.  We had better get these poor creatures up to the house, and\nlet them recover themselves.\"\n\nReady then beckoned to them to get on their feet, which they both did,\nalthough with some difficulty.  He then went in advance, making a sign\nfor them to follow; they understood him, and made the attempt, but were\nso weak, that they would have fallen if they had not been supported by\nMr Seagrave and William.\n\nIt required a long time for them to arrive at the house.  Mrs Seagrave,\nwho knew what had happened, received them very kindly, and Juno had a\nmess ready, which she put before them.  They ate a little and then lay\ndown, and were soon sound asleep.\n\n\"It is fortunate for us that they are women,\" observed Mr Seagrave: \"we\nshould have had great difficulty had they been men.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Ready; \"but still we must not trust women too much\nat first, for they are savages.\"\n\n\"Where shall we put them to-night, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I have been thinking about that.  I wish we had a shed close\nto us; but as we have not, we must let them sleep in the storehouse.\"\n\nWe must now pass over a space of fifteen days, in which there was\nnothing done.  The expectation of the vessel returning was still alive,\nalthough each day decreased these hopes.  Every morning Ready and\nWilliam were at the beach with the telescope, and the whole of the day\nwas passed in surmises, hopes, and fears.  In fact, the appearance of\nthe vessel and the expectation of leaving the island had completely\noverturned all the regularity and content of our island party.  No other\nsubject was broached--not any of the work proposed was begun, as it was\nuseless to do anything if they were to leave the island.  After the\nfirst week had passed, they felt that every day their chances were more\nadverse, and at the end of the fortnight all hopes were very unwillingly\nabandoned.\n\nThe Indian women had, in the meantime, recovered their fatigues, and\nappeared to be very mild and tractable.  Whatever they were able to do,\nthey did cheerfully, and had already gained a few words of English.  The\nparty to explore was again talked over, and arranged for the following\nMonday, when a new misfortune fell on them, which disconcerted all their\narrangements.\n\nOn the Saturday morning, when Ready, as usual, went his rounds, as he\nwalked along the beach, he perceived that the Indian canoe was missing.\nIt had been hauled up clear of the water, so that it could not have\nfloated away.  Ready's heart misgave him; he looked through his\ntelescope in the direction of the large island, and thought he could\ndistinguish a speck on the water at a great distance.  As he was thus\noccupied, William came down to him.\n\n\"William,\" said Ready, \"I fear those island women have escaped in their\ncanoe.  Run up, and see if they are in the outhouse, or anywhere else,\nand let me know as soon as you can.\"\n\nWilliam in a few minutes returned, breathless, stating that the women\nwere not to be found, and that they had evidently carried away with them\na quantity of the large nails and other pieces of iron which were in the\nsmall kegs in the storehouse.\n\n\"This is bad, William; this is worse than the vessel not coming back.\"\n\n\"Why, we can do without them, Ready.\"\n\n\"Yes; but when they get back to their own people, and show them the iron\nthey have brought with them, and describe how much more there is to be\nhad, depend upon it, we shall have a visit from them in numbers, that\nthey may obtain more.  I ought to have known better than to leave the\ncanoe here.  We must go and consult with Mr Seagrave, for the sooner we\nbegin to work now, the better.\"\n\nThey communicated the intelligence to Mr Seagrave when they were\noutside.  He at once perceived their danger, so they held a council, and\ncame to the following resolutions:--\n\nThat it would be necessary that they should immediately stockade the\nstorehouse, so as to render it impossible for any one to get in; and\nthat, as soon as the fortification was complete, the storehouse should\nbe turned into their dwelling-house; and such stores as could not be put\nwithin the stockade should be removed to their present house, or\nconcealed in the cocoa-nut grove.\n\nIt was decided that nothing should be begun on that day, Saturday; that\nSunday should be spent in devout prayer for help and encouragement from\nthe Almighty, who would do towards them as his wisdom should ordain; and\nthat on Monday, with the blessing of God, they would recommence their\nlabour.\n\n\"I don't know why, but I feel more courage now that there is a prospect\nof danger, than I felt when there was little or none,\" said Mrs\nSeagrave.\n\n\"How little do we know what the day may bring forth!\" exclaimed Mr\nSeagrave.  \"How joyful were our anticipations when the vessel hoisted\nher colours! we felt sure that we were to be taken off the island.  The\nsame gale that drove the vessel away brought down to us the island\nwomen.  The fair weather after the gale, which we hoped would have\nbrought back the vessel to our succour, on the contrary enabled the\nwomen to escape in the canoe, and make known our existence to those who\nmay come to destroy us.  How true it is that man plans in vain; and that\nit is only by the Almighty will and pleasure that he can obtain his\nends!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 45.\n\nBut although they resolved as stated in the last chapter, nothing was\ndone.  Finally, one morning at sunrise, as they were looking round with\nthe telescope, close to the turtle-pond, Masterman Ready said to Mr\nSeagrave, \"Indeed, sir, we must no longer remain in this state of\nidleness; I have been thinking a great deal of our present position and\nprospects; as to the vessel coming back, we must, at present, give up\nall hopes of it.  I only wish that we were quite as sure that we shall\nnot have a visit from the savages: that is my great fear, and it really\nhaunts me; the idea of our being surprised some night, and Mrs Seagrave\nand the dear children, perhaps, murdered in their beds, is awful to\nreflect upon.\"\n\n\"God help us!\" exclaimed Mr Seagrave, covering up his face.\n\n\"God will help us, Mr Seagrave, but at the same time it is necessary\nthat we should help ourselves; he will give his blessing to our\nexertions, but we cannot expect that miracles will be performed for us;\nand if we remain as we now are, inactive, and taking no steps to meet\nthe danger which threatens us, we cannot expect the divine assistance.\nWe have had a heavy shock, but it is now time that we recover from it,\nand put our own shoulders to the wheel.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Ready,\" replied William; \"indeed I have been thinking\nthe same thing for many days past.\"\n\n\"We have all been thinking of it, I believe,\" said Mr Seagrave; \"I'm\nsure I have lain awake night after night, considering our position and\nwhat we ought to do, but I have never been able to come to any\nsatisfactory resolution.\"\n\n\"No more have I till last night, Mr Seagrave, but I think that I have\nnow something to propose which, perhaps, will meet with your approval,\"\nreplied Ready; \"so now, sir, suppose we hold another council, and come\nto a decision.\"\n\n\"I am most willing, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, sitting down upon a rock;\n\"and as you are the oldest, and moreover the best adviser of the three,\nwe will first hear what you have to propose.\"\n\n\"Well then, Mr Seagrave, it appears to me that it will not do to remain\nin the house, for we may, as I have said, be surprised by the savages at\nany hour in the night, and we have no means of defence against numbers.\"\n\n\"I feel that, and have felt it for some time,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\"What shall we do, then; shall we return to the cove?\"\n\n\"I should think not, sir,\" said Ready; \"what I propose is this: we have\nmade a discovery on the south of the island, which is of great\nimportance to us; not that I consider the fruit and other plants of any\ngreat value, as they will only serve to increase our luxuries, if I may\nso call them, during the summer season.  One great advantage to us, is\nthe feed which we have found for our live stock, and the fodder for them\nduring the rainy season; but principally, the patch of yams, which will\nafford us food during the winter.  They are of great importance to us,\nand we cannot too soon protect them from the pigs, which will certainly\nroot them all up, if we do not prevent them.  Now, sir, you know what we\nhad arranged to do, but which we have not done; I think the cocoa-nut\nrails will take too much time, and it will be sufficient to make a ditch\nand hedge round the yams; but it will be very tedious if we are to go\nbackwards and forwards to do the work, and Mrs Seagrave and the\nchildren will be left alone.  I therefore propose, as the weather is now\nset in fair, and will remain so for months, that we pitch our tents on\nthat part of the island, and remove the whole family there; we shall\nsoon be very comfortable, and at all events much safer there than if we\nremain here, without any defence.\"\n\n\"It is an excellent plan, Ready; we shall, as you say, be removed from\ndanger for the time, and when there, we may consider what we had best do\nby and by.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Those women may not have gained the other island, it is\ntrue, for they had the wind right against them for several days after\nthey went away in the canoe, and, moreover, the current sets strong this\nway; but if they have, we must expect that the savages will pay us a\nvisit; they will, of course, come direct to the house, if they do come.\"\n\n\"But, Ready, you don't mean to say that we are to leave this side of the\nisland altogether, and all our comfortable arrangements?\" said William.\n\n\"No, William, not altogether; for now I come to the second part of my\nproposition.  As soon as we have done our work at the yam plantation,\nand made everything as comfortable there as we can, I think we may then\nleave Mrs Seagrave and the children in the tents, and work here.  As we\nbefore agreed, let us abandon the house in which we live at present, and\nfit out the outhouse which is concealed in the cocoa-nut grove, as a\ndwelling-house, and fortify it so as to be secure against any sudden\nattack of the savages: for, return here we must, to live, as we cannot\nremain in the tents after the rainy season sets in.\"\n\n\"How do you propose to fortify it, Ready?\" said Mr Seagrave; \"I hardly\nknow.\"\n\n\"That I will explain to you by and by, sir.  Then, if the savages come\nhere, at all events we should be able to defend ourselves with\nfire-arms; one man behind a stockade is better than twenty who have no\nother arms but spears and clubs; and we may, with the help of God, beat\nthem off.\"\n\n\"I think your plan is excellent, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"and that\nthe sooner we begin, the better.\"\n\n\"That there is no doubt of, sir.  Now, the first job is for William and\nme to try for the passage through this side of the reef with the boat,\nand then we will look for the little harbour which we discovered; as\nsoon as that is done, we will return and take the tents and all we\nrequire round in the boat, and when we have pitched the tents and all is\narranged, Mrs Seagrave and the children can walk through the wood with\nus, and take possession.\"\n\n\"Let us not lose an hour, Ready; we have lost too much time already,\"\nreplied Mr Seagrave.  \"What shall we do to-day?\"\n\n\"After breakfast, William and I will take the boat, and try for the\npassage.  You can remain here, packing up the tents and such articles as\nmust first be carried round.  We shall be back, I hope, by dinner-time.\"\n\nThey then rose, and walked towards the house; all felt relieved in their\nminds, after they had made this arrangement, satisfied that they would\nbe using all human endeavours to ward off the danger which threatened\nthem, and might then put their confidence in that Providence who would,\nif he thought fit, protect them in their need.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 46.\n\nThe subject was introduced to Mrs Seagrave, while they were at\nbreakfast, and as she perceived how much more secure they would be, she\ncheerfully consented.  In less than an hour afterwards, William and\nReady had prepared the boat, and were pulling out among the rocks of the\nreef to find a passage, which, after a short time, and by keeping two or\nthree cables from the point, they succeeded in doing.\n\n\"This is very fortunate, William,\" observed Ready; \"but we must now take\nsome marks to find our way in again.  See, the large black rock is on a\nline with the garden point: so, if we keep them in one, we shall know\nthat we are in the proper channel; and now for a mark abreast of us, to\nfind out when we enter it.\"\n\n\"Why, Ready, the corner of the turtle-pond just touches the right wall\nof the house,\" replied William.\n\n\"So it does; that will do; and now let us pull away as hard as we can,\nso as to be back in good time.\"\n\nThey soon were on the south side of the island, and pulling up along the\nshore.\n\n\"How far do you think that it is by water, Ready?\"\n\n\"I hardly know; but at least four or five miles, so we must make up our\nminds to a good hour's pull.  At all events, we shall sail back again\nwith this wind, although there is but little of it.\"\n\n\"We are in very deep water now,\" observed William, after a long silence.\n\n\"Yes, on this side of the island we must expect it; the coral grows to\nleeward only.  I think that we cannot be very far from the little\nharbour we discovered.  Suppose we leave off rowing for a minute, and\nlook about us.\"\n\n\"There are two rocks close to the shore, Ready,\" said William, pointing,\n\"and you recollect there were two or three rocks outside of the\nharbour.\"\n\n\"Very true, William, and I should not wonder if you have hit upon the\nvery spot.  Let us pull in.\"\n\nThey did so; and, to their satisfaction, found that they were in the\nharbour, where the water was as smooth as a pond.\n\n\"Now, then, William, we will step the mast, and sail back at our\nleisure.\"\n\n\"Stop one moment, Ready; give me the boat-hook.  I see something between\nthe clefts of the rocks.\"\n\nReady handed the boat-hook to William, who, lowering it down into the\nwater, drove the spike of iron at the end of it into a large crayfish,\nwhich he hauled up into the boat.\n\n\"That will be an addition to our dinner,\" said Ready; \"we do not go back\nempty-handed, and, therefore, as the saying is, we shall be more\nwelcome; now, then, let us start, for we must pull here again this\nafternoon, and with a full cargo on board.\"\n\nThey stepped the mast, and as soon as they had pulled the boat clear of\nthe harbour, set sail, and in less than an hour had rejoined the party\nat the house.\n\nWilliam had brought up the crayfish, which had only one claw, and Juno\nput on another pot of water to boil it, as an addition to the dinner,\nwhich was nearly ready.  Tommy at first went with his sister Caroline to\nlook at the animal, and as soon as he had left off admiring it, he\nbegan, as usual, to tease it; first he poked its eyes with a stick, then\nhe tried to unfold his tail, but the animal flapped, and he ran away.\nAt last he was trying to put his stick into the creature's mouth, when\nit raised its large claw, and caught him by the wrist, squeezing him so\ntight that Tommy screamed and danced about as the crayfish held on.\nFortunately for him, the animal had been so long out of water, and had\nbeen so much hurt by the iron spike of the boat-hook, that it was more\nthan half-dead, or he would have been severely hurt.  Ready ran to him,\nand disengaged the crayfish; but Tommy was so frightened, that he took\nto his heels, and did not leave off running until he was one hundred\nyards from the house, while Juno and Ready were laughing at him till the\ntears came into their eyes.  When he saw the crayfish on the table, he\nappeared to be afraid of it, although it was dead.\n\n\"Well, Tommy,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"I suppose you won't eat any of the\ncrayfish?\"\n\n\"Won't I?\" replied Tommy.  \"I'll eat him, for he tried to eat me.\"\n\n\"Why did you not leave the animal alone, Tommy?\" said Mr Seagrave; \"if\nyou had not tormented it, it would not have bitten you; I don't know\nwhether you ought to have any.\"\n\n\"I don't like it; I won't have any,\" replied Tommy.  \"I like salt pork\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you don't like it, you shall not have it forced upon\nyou, Tommy,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"so now we'll divide it among the\nrest of us.\"\n\nTommy was not very well pleased at this decision, for he really did wish\nto have some of it, so he turned very sulky for the rest of the\ndinner-time, especially when old Ready told him that he had had his\nshare of the crayfish before dinner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 47.\n\nAs soon as the meal was over, Mr Seagrave and Juno assisted them in\ncarrying down the canvas and poles for the tent, with shovels to clear\naway, and the pegs to fix the tents up properly.  Before they started,\nWilliam observed, \"I think it would be a good thing, if Ready and I were\nto take our bedding with us, and then we could fix up one tent this\nevening, and sleep there; to-morrow morning we might set up the other,\nand get a good deal of work over before we come back.\"\n\n\"You are right, William,\" replied Ready; \"let us see what Juno can give\nus to eat, and then we will do as you say, for the sooner we are all\nthere the better.\"\n\nAs Mr Seagrave was of the same opinion, Juno packed up a piece of salt\npork and some flour-cakes, which, with three or four bottles of water,\nthey took down to the boat.  Ready having thrown in a piece of rope to\nmoor the boat with, they shoved off and were soon through the reef, and,\nafter a smart pull, they arrived again at the small harbour.\n\nAs soon as they had landed all the things, they made the boat fast by\nthe rope, and then carried a portion of the canvas and tent-poles up to\nthe first copse of trees, which were the guavas; they then returned for\nthe remainder, and after three trips everything was up.\n\n\"Now, William, we must see where to pitch the tent; we must not be too\nnear the cocoa-nut grove, or we shall have too far to go for water.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that the best place will be close to the bananas? the\nground is higher there, and the water is, you know, between the bananas\nand the yams.\"\n\n\"Very true, I think it will not be a bad place; let us walk there first,\nand reconnoitre the ground.\"\n\nThey walked to where the bananas were now throwing out their beautiful\nlarge green leaves, and decided that they would fix the tents upon the\nnorth side of them.\n\n\"So here let it be,\" said Ready; \"and now let us go and fetch all the\nthings; it is a nice dry spot, and I think will do capitally.\"\n\nThey were soon hard at work, and long before sunset one tent was ready,\nand they had put their bedding in it.\n\n\"Well, now, I suppose you are a little tired,\" said Ready; \"I'm sure you\nought to be, for you have worked hard to-day.\"\n\n\"I don't feel very tired, Ready, but it's not time to go to bed yet.\"\n\n\"No; and I think we had better take our shovels and dig the pits for the\nwater, and then we shall know by to-morrow morning whether the water is\ngood or not.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ready, we can do that before we get our supper.\"\n\nThey walked to where the ground between the bananas and yam patch was\nwet and swampy, and dug two large holes about a yard deep and square;\nthe water trickled in very fast, and they were up to their ankles before\nthey had finished.\n\n\"There'll be no want of water, Ready, if it is only fit to drink.\"\n\n\"I've no fear of that,\" replied Ready.\n\nThey returned to the tent and made their supper off the salt pork and\nflour-cakes, and then lay down on the mattresses.  They were soon fast\nasleep, for they were tired out with the hard work which they had gone\nthrough.\n\nThe next morning, at sunrise, they were up again; the first thing they\ndid was to go and examine the holes they had dug for water; they found\nthem full and running over, and the water had settled quite clear; they\ntasted it, and pronounced it very good.\n\nAs soon as they had washed themselves, they went back and made their\nbreakfast, and then set to work to get up the other tent.  They then\ncleared all the ground near the tents of brushwood and high grass, and\nlevelled it nicely with their shovels inside.\n\n\"Now, William, we have another job, which is to prepare a fireplace for\nJuno: we must go down to the beach for stones.\"\n\nIn another hour the fireplace was completed, and Ready and William\nlooked at their work.\n\n\"Well, I call this a very comfortable lodging-house,\" said Ready.\n\n\"And I am sure,\" replied William, \"it's very pretty.  Mamma will be\ndelighted with it.\"\n\n\"We shall have no want of bananas in a few weeks,\" said Ready; \"look,\nthey are all in blossom already.  Well, now I suppose we had better\nleave everything here, and go back.  We must have another trip this\nafternoon, and sleep here to-night.\"\n\nThey went down to the boat, and sailed back as before; by ten o'clock in\nthe morning they had regained the house, and then they made arrangements\nfor their work during the remainder of the day.  It was agreed that the\nprovisions necessary for a day or two, the table and chairs, the cooking\nutensils, and a portion of their clothes, should be taken round that\nafternoon, that Ready and William should come back early the next\nmorning, and then they should all set off together through the wood to\nthe new location.  The sheep and lambs (for they had four lambs), the\ngoats and kids, were to be driven through the wood by Mr Seagrave;\nWilliam and Ready and the dogs would be very useful in driving them.  As\nfor the fowls and chickens, it was decided they should be left, as Ready\nand William could look after them on their occasional visits.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 48.\n\nThe boat was well loaded that afternoon, and they had a heavy pull\nround, and hard work afterwards to carry all the articles up.  William\nand Ready were, therefore, not sorry when their work was done, and they\nwent to bed as soon as they had taken their supper.\n\nAt sunrise, they went back to the bay in the boat, which they hauled up,\nand then proceeded to the house, where they found that everyone was\nready to start.  Mr Seagrave had collected all the animals, and they\nset off; the marks on the trees were very plain, and they had no\ndifficulty in finding their way; but they had a good deal of trouble\nwith the goats and sheep, and did not get on very fast.  It was three\nhours before they got clear of the cocoa-nut grove, and Mrs Seagrave\nwas quite tired out.  At last they arrived, and Mr and Mrs Seagrave\ncould not help exclaiming \"How beautiful!\"\n\nWhen they came to where the tents were pitched by the side of the\nbananas, they were equally pleased: it was quite a fairy spot.  Mrs\nSeagrave went into her tent to repose after her fatigue; the goats and\nsheep were allowed to stray away as they pleased; the dogs lay down,\npanting with their long journey; Juno put Albert on the bed while she\nwent with William to collect fuel to cook the dinner; Ready went to the\npits to get some water, while Mr Seagrave walked about, examining the\ndifferent clumps of trees with which the meadow was studded.\n\nWhen Ready returned with the water, he called the dogs, and went back\ntowards the yam plantation.  Tommy followed them; the dogs went into the\nyams, and were soon barking furiously, which pleased Tommy very much;\nwhen, of a sudden, out burst again in a drove all the pigs, followed by\nthe dogs, and so close to Tommy that he screamed with fright, and\ntumbled head over heels.\n\n\"I thought you were there, my gentlemen,\" said Ready, looking after the\npigs; \"the sooner we fence you out the better.\"\n\nThe pigs scampered away, and went into the cocoa-nut grove as they had\ndone before.  The dogs followed the pigs, and did not return for a long\nwhile afterwards.\n\nIt was late before the dinner was ready, and they were all very glad to\ngo early to bed.\n\nAt day dawn, William and Ready had again started, and walked through the\ncocoa-nut grove back to the house, to bring round in the boat the\narticles of furniture and the clothes which had been left.  Having\ncollected everything in the house, and procured some more pork and flour\nfrom the storehouse, they completed the load by spearing one of the\nturtles which remained, and putting it into the bottom of the boat; they\nthen set off again for their new residence, and arrived in time for\nbreakfast.\n\n\"What a delightful spot this is!\" said Mrs Seagrave.  \"I think we ought\nalways to make it our summer residence, and only go back to the house\nduring the rainy season.\"\n\n\"It is much cooler here, madam, during the summer, and much more\npleasant; but we are more protected in the house by the cocoa-nut\ngrove.\"\n\n\"Yes; that is true, and it is very valuable during the rainy season; but\nit makes it warmer in the summer time.  I like the change, Ready, and\nshall be sorry when we have to go back again.\"\n\n\"Now I must go, and help Juno to cut up the turtle,\" said Ready.  \"We\nmust make our larder among the banana trees.\"\n\n\"But what are we all to do, Ready?\" said Mr Seagrave.  \"We must not be\nidle.\"\n\n\"No, sir; but I think we must give up this day to putting everything to\nrights, and making everything comfortable inside the tents; to-morrow we\nwill commence the ditch and hedge round the yam plantation.  We need not\nwork very hard at it, for I don't think the pigs will venture here\nagain, as I mean to tie up all the dogs round the yam patch every night,\nand their barking will keep them off.\"\n\n\"That will be a very good plan, Ready.  What beautiful food there is for\nthe sheep and goats!\"\n\n\"Yes; this must be their future residence for the best part of the year.\nI think to-morrow we will begin a piece of the ditch, and show William\nhow to put in the cuttings of prickly pear for the hedge, and then, I\nshould propose that you and I go to the cove to examine the stores and\nselect what it will be necessary to bring round.  I think you said that\nyou must go yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ready, I wish to go.  When we have made our selection, I will\nreturn, and then you and William, who is more used to the boat than I\nam, can bring the stores round.  I presume we shall not bring them\nhere?\"\n\n\"No, sir, we will take them round to the storehouse.  When we have done\nthat job, we must then commence our alterations and our stockade.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 49.\n\nThe next morning they went with their shovels to the yam plantation, and\ncommenced their work.  As the ground was soft and swampy, the labour was\nvery easy.  The ditch was dug nearly a yard wide, and the earth thrown\nup on a bank inside.  They then went to where the large patch of prickly\npears grew, and cut a quantity, which they planted on the top of the\nbank.  Before night, they had finished about nine or ten yards of the\nhedge and ditch.\n\n\"I don't think that the pigs will get over that when it is finished,\"\nsaid Ready, \"and William will be able to get on by himself when we are\ngone, as well as if we were with him.\"\n\n\"I'll try if I cannot shoot a pig or two,\" said William.\n\n\"Let it be a young one, then; we must not kill the old ones.  Now I\nthink we may as well go back.  Juno is carrying in the supper.\"\n\nBefore Mr Seagrave and Ready started on the following morning, the\nlatter gave William directions as to the boat.  The provisions and the\nknapsack having been already prepared, they took leave of Mrs Seagrave,\nand set off, each armed with a musket, and Ready with his axe slung over\nhis shoulder.  They had a long walk before them, as they had first to\nfind their way back to the house, and from thence had to walk through\nthe wood to the cove.\n\nIn two hours after leaving the house they reached the spot where they\nhad first landed.  The rocks near to it were strewed with timber and\nplanks, which lay bleaching in the sun, or half-buried in the sand.  Mr\nSeagrave sat down, and sighed deeply as he said, \"Ready, the sight of\nthese timbers, of which the good ship Pacific was built, recalls\nfeelings which I had hoped to have dismissed from my mind; but I cannot\nhelp them rising up.  The remains of this vessel appear to me as the\nlast link between us and the civilised world, which we have been torn\nfrom, and all my thoughts of home and country, and I may say all my\nlonging for them, are revived as strong as ever.\"\n\n\"And very natural that they should, Mr Seagrave; I feel it also.  I am\ncontent, it is true, because I have nothing to wish or look forward to;\nbut still I could not help thinking of poor Captain Osborn and my\nshipmates, as I looked upon the wreck, and wishing that I might take\nthem by the hand again.  It is very natural that one should do so.  Why,\nsir, do you know that I feel unhappy even about the poor ship.  We\nsailors love our vessels, especially when they have good qualities, and\nthe Pacific was as fine a vessel as ever was built.  Now, sir, I feel\nquite melancholy when I see her planks and timbers lying about here.\nBut, sir, if we cannot help feeling as we do, it is our duty to check\nthe feeling, so that it does not get the mastery over us.  We can do no\nmore.\"\n\n\"Very true, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave, rising up; \"it is not only\nuseless, but even sinful to indulge in them, as they only can lead to\nour repining at the decrees of heaven.  Let us now examine the rocks,\nand see if anything has been thrown up that may be of use to us.\"\n\nThey walked round, but, with the exception of spars and a barrel or two\nof tar, they could find nothing of value.  There was no want of staves\nand iron hoops of broken casks, and these, Ready observed, would make\nexcellent palings for the garden when they had time to bring them round.\n\nAfter they had returned, they sat down to rest themselves, and then they\nwent to the tents in the cocoa-nut grove, in which they had collected\nthe articles thrown up when the ship went to pieces.\n\n\"Why, the pigs have been at work here!\" said Ready; \"they have contrived\nto open one cask of flour somehow or another; look, sir--I suppose it\nmust have been shaky, or they could not have routed into it; the canvas\nis not good for much, I fear; fortunately, we have several bolts of new,\nwhich I brought on shore.  Now, sir, we will see what condition the\nstores are in.  All these are casks of flour, and we run no risk in\nopening them, and seeing if they are in good order.\"\n\nThe first cask which was opened had a cake round it as hard as a board;\nbut when it was cut through with the axe, the inside was found in a good\nstate.\n\n\"That's all right, sir; and I presume the others will be the same; the\nsalt water has got in so far and made a crust, which has preserved the\nrest.  But now let us go to dinner, and to work afterwards.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 50.\n\nAfter dinner they resumed their labour.  \"I wonder what's in this case?\"\nsaid Mr Seagrave, pointing to the first at hand.  Ready set to work\nwith his axe, and broke off the lid, and found a number of pasteboard\nboxes full of tapes, narrow ribbons, stay-laces, whalebones, and cottons\non reels.\n\n\"This has been sent out for some Botany Bay milliner,\" said Mr\nSeagrave.  \"I presume, however, we must confiscate it for the benefit of\nMrs Seagrave and Miss Caroline.  We will take them to them as soon as\nwe have time.\"\n\nThe next was a box without a lock; the lid was forced up, and they found\na dozen half-gallon square bottles of gin stored in divisions.\n\n\"That's Hollands, sir, I know,\" said Ready; \"what shall we do with it?\"\n\n\"We will not destroy it, Ready, but at the same time we will not use it\nbut as a medicine,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"we have been so long used to\nspring-water, that it would be a pity to renew a taste for spirituous\nliquors.\"\n\n\"I trust we shall never want to drink a drop of it, sir, either as a\nmedicine or otherwise.  Now for this cask with wooden hoops.\"\n\nThe head was soon out, and discovered a dinner set of painted china with\ngold edges.\n\n\"This, Mr Seagrave, may be useful, for we are rather short of plates\nand dishes.  Common white would have served as well.\"\n\n\"And be more suitable with our present outfit,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"Here's a box with your name on it, sir,\" said Ready; \"do you know what\nis in it?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, Ready; but your axe will decide the point.\"\n\nWhen the box was opened, everything appeared in a sad mouldy state from\nthe salt water which had penetrated; but on removing the brown paper and\npasteboard, it was found to contain stationery of all sorts, and, except\non the outside, it was very little injured.\n\n\"This is indeed a treasure, Ready.  I recollect now; this is paper,\npens, and everything requisite for writing, besides children's books,\ncopy-books, paint-boxes, and a great many other articles in the\nstationery line.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, that is fortunate.  Now we may set up our school, and as the\nwhole population of the island will attend it, it will really be a\nNational School.\"\n\n\"Very true, Ready.  Now for that cask.\"\n\n\"I can tell what that is by the outside; it is oil, and very acceptable,\nfor our candles are nearly out.  Now we come to the most valuable of all\nour property.\"\n\n\"What is that, Ready?\"\n\n\"All the articles which I brought on shore in the different trips I took\nin the boat before the ship went to pieces; for you see, sir, iron don't\nswim, and, therefore, what I looked after most was ironware of all\nsorts, and tools.  Here are three kegs of small nails, besides two bags\nof large, and there are several axes, hammers, and other tools, besides\nhanks of twine, sailing needles, and bees'-wax.\"\n\n\"They are indeed valuable, Ready.\"\n\n\"Here's some more of my plunder, as the Americans say.  All these are\nwash-deck buckets, this a small harness cask for salting meat, and\nhere's the cook's wooden trough for making bread, which will please Miss\nJuno; and in it, you see, I have put all the galley-hooks, ladles, and\nspoons, and the iron trivets, and here's two lamps.  I think I put some\ncotton wicks somewhere--I know I did; we shall find them by and by.\nHere's the two casks, one of cartridges made up, and the other of\ngunpowder, and the other six muskets.\"\n\n\"These are really treasures, Ready, and yet how well we have done\nwithout them.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir, but we shall do better with them, and when we fit up\nthe storehouse for a dwelling, Mr Seagrave, we shall be able to make it\na little more comfortable in every respect than the present one; for you\nsee there, all the fir-planking and deals, which William and I buried in\nthe sand.\"\n\n\"I really had quite forgotten them, Ready.  If I could but get the fear\nof the savages coming over out of my head, I really think we might live\nvery comfortably even on this island.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Mr Seagrave, I am glad to hear you say that, for it\nproves that you are more contented and resigned than you were.\"\n\n\"I am so, Ready--at least I think so; but perhaps it is, that the\nimmediate danger from the savages so fills my thoughts, that I no longer\ndwell so much upon our being taken off the island.\"\n\n\"I dare say it is as you state, sir; but now let us go on with our\nsearch.  Here are the ship's compasses, and deep sea line and reel, also\nthe land lead.  The stuff will be very useful for our little boat.\"\n\n\"And I am very glad of the compasses, Ready; for with them I shall be\nable to make a sort of survey of the island, when I have a little time.\nYour pocket compass is too small for surveying.  I shall take some\nbearings now, while I am here, as I may not be back again very soon.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I think if we open this other case, which I perceive has\nyour name on it, it will be as much as we need do to-day, for the sun is\ngoing down; we can then make up some kind of bed, eat our suppers, and\ngo to sleep.\"\n\n\"I am very tired, Ready, and shall be glad to do as you propose.  That\ncase contains books; but what portion of my library I do not know.\"\n\n\"But you soon will, sir,\" replied Ready, wrenching it open with his axe.\n\"They are a little stained on the outside, but they are jammed so tight\nthat they do not appear to have suffered much.  Here are one or two,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Plutarch's Lives.  I am glad I have them: they are excellent reading\nfor young or old; there is no occasion to open any more, as I know all\nthe other books in the case are `History'; perhaps the best case which\ncould have been saved.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 51.\n\nMr Seagrave and Ready then set to work, and made a rough sort of bed of\ncocoa-nut branches; and, after eating their supper, committed themselves\nto the divine protection, and went to sleep.  The next morning they\nresumed their labour, and opened every other case and package that had\nbeen saved from the wreck; they found more books, four boxes of candles,\nthree casks of rice, and several other useful articles, besides many\nothers which were of no value to them.\n\nA chest of tea, and two bags of coffee, which Ready had brought on\nshore, were, much to their delight, found in good order; but there was\nno sugar, the little which they had saved having been melted away.\n\n\"That's unfortunate, sir.\"\n\n\"We cannot expect to get things here, as though we were a hundred yards\nfrom a grocer's shop.  Now let us go to where we covered up the other\narticles with sand.\"\n\nThe sand was shovelled up, and the barrels of beef and pork and the deal\nboards found in good order, but many other things were quite spoilt.\nAbout noon they had finished, and as they had plenty of time, Mr\nSeagrave took the bearings of the different points of land with the\ncompasses.  They then shouldered their muskets, and set off on their\nreturn.\n\nThey gained the house in the bay, and having rested a little while at\nthe storehouse, they proceeded on their way to the tents in the meadow.\nThey had about half a mile to go, when Ready heard a noise, and made a\nsign to Mr Seagrave to stop.  Ready, whispering to Mr Seagrave that\nthe pigs were all close to them, loaded his musket; Mr Seagrave did the\nsame, and they walked very softly to where they now heard their\ngrunting; they did not see them till they were within twenty yards, and\nthen they came upon the whole herd; the pigs raised their heads; the old\nones gave a loud grunt, and then, just as Ready fired his musket, they\nall set off at full speed.  Mr Seagrave had no opportunity of firing,\nbut Ready had shot one, which lay kicking and struggling under a\ncocoa-nut tree.\n\n\"A piece of fresh pork will be quite a treat, Mr Seagrave,\" said Ready,\nas they walked up to where the animal was lying.\n\n\"It will, indeed, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"we must contrive to\ncarry the beast home between us.\"\n\n\"We will sling it on the musket, sir, and it will not be very heavy.  It\nis one of those born on the island, and a very fine fellow for his age.\"\n\nThe pig was soon slung, and they carried it between them.  As they\ncleared the wood, they perceived Mrs Seagrave and William, who had\nheard the report of the musket, and had come out to meet them.\n\nWilliam took the load from his father, who walked on with Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Well, William, what news have you?\" said Ready.\n\n\"Why, very good, Ready.  Yesterday evening, when I was tired of work, I\nthought I would take the boat, and try if there was any fish to be\ncaught on this side of the island in the deep water, and I caught three\nlarge ones, quite different from those we took among the reefs.  We had\none for breakfast and dinner to-day, and it was excellent.\"\n\n\"Did you go out in the boat by yourself?\"\n\n\"No; I took Juno with me.  She pulls very well, Ready.\"\n\n\"She is a handy girl, William.  Well, we have had our survey, and there\nwill be plenty of work for you and me, I can tell you; I don't think we\ncan bring everything round in a week; so I suppose to-morrow we had\nbetter be off.\"\n\n\"Well, I like boating better than ditching, I can tell you, Ready,\"\nreplied William.  \"I shan't be sorry to leave that work to my father.\"\n\n\"I suppose it must fall to him; as he will, of course, prefer staying\nwith Mrs Seagrave and the children.\"\n\nAs soon as they were at the tents, Ready hung up the pig to the cross\npole of the tent in which he and William and Mr Seagrave slept, and\nhaving propped the muskets up against the side of the tent, he went with\nWilliam to get his knife and some stretchers of wood to open the pig\nwith.  While he and William were away, Caroline and Tommy came out to\nlook at it, and Tommy, after telling Caroline how glad he was that they\nwere to have roast pig for dinner, took up one of the muskets, and said,\n\"Now, Caroline, I'll shoot the pig.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Tommy, you must not touch the gun,\" cried Caroline; \"papa will be\nvery angry.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" replied Tommy.  \"I'll show you how to shoot the pig.\"\n\n\"Don't, Tommy,\" cried Caroline; \"if you do, I'll go and tell mamma.\"\n\n\"Then I'll shoot you,\" replied Tommy, trying to point the musket at her.\n\nCaroline was so frightened, that she ran away as fast as she could, and\nthen Tommy, using all his strength, contrived to get the musket up to\nhis shoulder, and pulled the trigger.\n\nIt so happened that Tommy had taken up Mr Seagrave's musket, which had\nnot been fired, and when he pulled the trigger it went off, and as he\ndid not hold it tight to his shoulder, it recoiled, and hit him with the\nbutt right on his face, knocking out two of his teeth, besides making\nhis nose bleed very fast.\n\nTommy was so astonished and frightened at the musket going off, and the\nblow which he received, that he gave a loud yell, dropped the musket,\nand ran to the tent where his father and mother were, just as they had\nstarted up and had rushed out at hearing the report.\n\nWhen Mrs Seagrave saw Tommy all covered with blood, and screaming so\nloud, she was so alarmed that she could not stand, and fell fainting in\nMr Seagrave's arms.  Ready and William, on hearing the musket go off,\nhad run as fast as they could, fearing that some accident had happened;\nand while Mr Seagrave supported his wife, Ready went to Tommy, and\nwiping the blood off his face with the palm of his hand, perceived that\nthere was no wound or serious mischief, and cried out to Mr Seagrave,\n\"He's not hurt, sir; it's only his nose bleeding.\"\n\n\"Musket knocked me down,\" cried Tommy, sobbing as the blood ran out of\nhis mouth.\n\n\"Serve you right, Tommy; you'll take care not to touch the musket\nagain.\"\n\n\"I won't touch it again,\" cried Tommy, blubbering.\n\nJuno now came up with some water to wash his face; Mrs Seagrave had\nrecovered, and gone back into the tent, on Mr Seagrave telling her that\nit was only Tommy's nose which was bleeding.\n\nIn about half-an-hour Tommy had ceased crying, and his nose had left off\nbleeding; his face was washed, and then it was discovered that he had\nlost two front teeth, and that his cheek and lips were very much\nbruised.  He was undressed, and put to bed, and was soon fast asleep.\n\n\"I should not have left the muskets,\" said Ready to William; \"it was my\nfault; but I thought Tommy had been told so often not to touch\nfire-arms, that he would not dare to do so.\"\n\n\"He pointed it at me, and tried to shoot me,\" said Caroline, \"but I ran\naway.\"\n\n\"Merciful heavens! what an escape!\" cried Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"He has been well punished this time, madam, and I'll venture to say he\nwill not touch a musket again in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he must be punished more,\" said Mr Seagrave.  \"He must\nremember it.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, if he is to be punished more, I think you cannot punish him\nbetter than by not allowing him to have any of the pig when it is\ncooked.\"\n\n\"I think so too, Ready; and therefore that is a settled thing--no pig\nfor Tommy.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 52.\n\nThe next morning Tommy's face presented a very woeful appearance.  His\ncheek and lips were swelled and black, and the loss of his two front\nteeth made him look much worse.\n\nTommy looked very glum when he came to breakfast.  There was the pig's\nfry for breakfast, and the smell of it had been very inviting to Tommy;\nbut when his father scolded him, and told him that he was not to have\none bit of the pig, he began to cry and roar so loud, that he was sent\naway from the tents till he had left off.\n\nAfter breakfast, Ready proposed that he and William should take the\nboat, and begin their labour of carrying the articles round from the\ncove to the bay where the house was, pointing out that there was not a\nday to be lost.  Juno had, at his request, already baked a large piece\nof the pig for them to take with them, and boiled a piece of salt pork,\nso that they were all ready to start.\n\n\"But, Ready,\" said Mrs Seagrave, \"how long do you intend to remain\nabsent with William?\"\n\n\"Why, madam, this is Wednesday; of course we shall be back on Saturday\nnight.\"\n\n\"My dear William, I cannot bear the idea of your being absent so long,\nand as you will be on the water every day, I shall be in a continual\nfright until I see you again.\"\n\n\"Well, mamma, I suppose I must write by the penny post, to let you know\nhow I am.\"\n\n\"Don't laugh at me, William.  I do wish there was a penny post, and that\nyou could write every day.\"\n\nReady and William made every preparation for a continued absence.  They\ntook their blankets with them, and a small pot for cooking, and when all\nwas prepared they bade Mr and Mrs Seagrave farewell.  They were now to\npull to the bay, and leave their luggage, and then go round to the cove.\nAs they shoved off, William took the dog Remus into the boat.\n\n\"Why do you take the dog, William? he will be of use here in keeping the\npigs away, but of no use to us.\"\n\n\"Yes, he will, Ready; I must take him; for I have an idea come into my\nhead, so let me have my own way.\"\n\n\"Well, William, you can always have your own way, as far as I'm\nconcerned; if you wish to take the dog, there is an end of the matter.\"\n\nThey hoisted the sail, and as the breeze was fresh, were round to the\nbay in a very short time.  They took their provisions and stores up to\nthe house, and made fast the door, called the fowls, and gave them some\ndamaged rice which Ready had brought from the cove, and found, to their\ngreat delight, that they had now upwards of forty chickens; some,\nindeed, quite grown, and large enough to kill.\n\nThey then got into the boat again, and pulled away for the cove; the\nwind was fresh, and against them, so they had a long pull; but, as Ready\nobserved, it was much better that it should be so, as, when the boat was\nloaded, they could very quickly sail back again to the bay.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the cove, they lost no time in loading the\nboat; the nails, and iron work of every description, with the twine and\ntools, composed the major part of the first cargo; and calling Remus,\nwho was lying on the sandy beach, they shoved off, hoisted their sail,\nand in an hour had regained the bay, and passed through the reef.\n\n\"I am glad that this cargo has arrived safe, William, for it is very\nvaluable to us.  Now we will take them all up, and that will be\nsufficient for to-day; to-morrow, if we can, we will make two trips.\"\n\n\"We can, if we start early,\" replied William; \"but now let us have our\ndinner, and carry the remainder of the things up afterwards.\"\n\nAs they were eating their dinner, and William was giving the bones to\nthe dog, Ready said, \"Pray, William, what was the idea in your head\nwhich made you bring Remus with you?\"\n\n\"I will tell you, Ready; I mean him to carry a letter to mamma; you know\nthat he always goes back when he is ordered, and now I wish to see if he\nwill not go back to the tents, if he is told.  I have brought a piece of\npaper and pencil with me.\"\n\nWilliam then wrote on the paper:\n\n\"Dear Mamma:--We are quite well, and just returned with the first cargo\nquite safe.  Your affectionate son, WILLIAM.\"\n\nWilliam tied the paper round the dog's neck with a piece of twine, and\nthen calling him out of the house, said to him, \"Remus, go back, sir--go\nback, sir;\" the dog looked wistfully at William, as if not sure of what\nhe was to do, but William took up a stone, and pretended to throw it at\nthe dog, who ran away a little distance, and then stopped.\n\n\"_Go back_, Remus--_go back_, sir.\"  William again pretended to throw\nthe stone, repeating the order, and then the dog set off as fast as his\nlegs could carry him through the cocoa-nut grove.\n\n\"He is gone at all events,\" said William; \"I think he will go home.\"\n\n\"We shall see, sir,\" replied Ready; \"and now that we have finished our\ndinner, we will bring up the things, and put them in the storehouse.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 53.\n\nAs soon as they had carried up the whole of the cargo, they secured the\nboat, and went up to the house to sleep.  Just as they went in, Remus\ncame bounding up to them with a letter round his neck.\n\n\"Here's the dog, William,\" said Ready; \"he won't go home after all.\"\n\n\"How provoking!  I made sure he would go back; I really am disappointed.\nWe will give him nothing to eat, and then he will; but, dear me, Ready!\nthis is not the paper I tied round his neck.  I think not.  Let me see.\"\nWilliam took the paper, opened it, and read--\n\n\"Dear William:--Your letter arrived safe, and we are glad you are well.\nWrite every day, and God bless you; it was very clever of you and Remus.\nYour affectionate mother, SELINA SEAGRAVE.\"\n\n\"Well, it is clever,\" said Ready; \"I'm sure I had no idea he had gone;\nand his coming back again, too, when he was ordered.\"\n\n\"Dear Remus, good dog,\" said William, caressing it: \"now I'll give you a\ngood supper, for you deserve it.\"\n\n\"So he does, sir.  Well, you've established a post on the island, which\nis a great improvement.  Seriously, William, it may prove very useful.\"\n\n\"At all events it will be a great comfort to my mother.\"\n\n\"Yes, especially as we shall be obliged all three to be here when we fit\nup the storehouse, and make the proposed alterations.  Now I think we\nhad better go to bed, for we must be up with the lark to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Here I suppose we ought to say, up with the parrots; for they are the\nonly land birds on the island.\"\n\n\"You forget the pigeons; I saw one of them in the wood the other day.\nGood night!\"\n\nThe next morning, they were off before breakfast.  The boat was soon\nloaded, and they returned under sail.  They then breakfasted, and having\nleft the things they had brought on the beach, that they might lose no\ntime, they set off again, and returned with another cargo two hours\nbefore dusk; this they landed, and then secured the boat.  As soon as\nthey were in the house, William wrote on a piece of paper:--\n\n\"Dear Mamma:--We have brought round two cargoes to-day.  All well, and\nvery tired.  Yours, WILLIAM.\"\n\nRemus did not require any teaching this time.  William patted him, and\nsaid, \"Good dog.  Now, Remus, go back--go home, sir;\" and the dog wagged\nhis tail, and set off immediately.\n\nBefore they were in bed, the dog returned with the answer.\n\n\"How fast he must run, Ready! he has not been away more than two hours.\"\n\n\"No.  So, now, Remus, you shall have plenty of supper, and plenty of\npatting and coaxing, for you are a clever, good little dog.\"\n\nThe next day, as they had to take the two cargoes up to the house, they\ncould only make one trip to the cove.  On Saturday they only made one\ntrip, as they had to return to the tents, which they did by water,\nhaving first put a turtle into the boat; on their arrival, they found\nthem all at the little harbour, waiting to receive them.\n\n\"Well, William, you did keep your promise and send me a letter by post,\"\nsaid Mrs Seagrave.  \"How very delightful it is!  I shall have no fear\nnow when you are all away.\"\n\n\"I must teach Romulus and Vixen to do the same, mamma.\"\n\n\"And I'll teach the puppies,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"Yes, Tommy; by the time you can write a letter, the puppies will be old\nenough to carry it,\" said Ready.  \"Come, Albert, I'll carry you up; you\nand I haven't had a game of play for a long while.  How does the ditch\nand hedge get on, Mr Seagrave?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, Ready,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"I have nearly finished two\nsides.  I think by the end of next week I shall have pretty well\ninclosed it.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you must not work too hard, there is no great hurry; William\nand I can get through a great deal together.\"\n\n\"It is my duty to work, Ready; and I may add, it is a pleasure.\"\n\nAs they were at supper the conversation turned upon the cleverness shown\nby the dog Remus.\n\nMr Seagrave narrated many instances of the sagacity of animals, when\nWilliam asked the question of his father: \"What is the difference then\nbetween reason and instinct?\"\n\n\"The difference is very great, William, as I will explain to you; but I\nmust first observe, that it has been the custom to say that man is\ngoverned by reason, and animals by instinct, alone.  This is an error.\nMan has instinct as well as reason; and animals, although chiefly\ngoverned by instinct, have reasoning powers.\"\n\n\"In what points does man show that he is led by instinct?\"\n\n\"When a child is first born, William, it acts by instinct only: the\nreasoning powers are not yet developed; as we grow up, our reason\nbecomes every day more matured, and gains the mastery over our instinct,\nwhich decreases in proportion.\"\n\n\"Then when we have grown to a good old age, I suppose we have no\ninstinct left in us?\"\n\n\"Not so, my dear boy; there is one and a most powerful instinct\nimplanted in man which never deserts him on this side of the grave.  It\nis the fear, not of death, but of utter annihilation, that of becoming\nnothing after death.  This instinctive feeling could not have been so\ndeeply implanted in us, but as an assurance that we shall not be\nannihilated after death, but that our souls shall still exist, although\nour bodies shall have perished.  It may be termed the instinctive\nevidence of a future existence.\"\n\n\"That is very true, Mr Seagrave,\" observed Ready.\n\n\"Instinct in animals, William,\" continued Mr Seagrave, \"is a feeling\nwhich compels them to perform certain acts without previous thought or\nreflection; this instinct is in full force at the moment of their birth;\nit was therefore perfect in the beginning, and has never varied.  The\nswallow built her nest, the spider its web, the bee formed its comb,\nprecisely in the same way four thousand years ago, as they do now.  I\nmay here observe, that one of the greatest wonders of instinct is the\nmathematical form of the honeycomb of the bee, which has been proved by\ndemonstration to be that by which is given the greatest possible saving\nof time and labour.\"\n\n\"But that is all pure instinct, papa; now you said that animals had\nreasoning powers.  Will you point out to me how they show that they\nhave?\"\n\n\"I will, my dear boy; but we had better defer it till another evening.\nIt is now time to go to bed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 54.\n\nThe following day, being Sunday, was devoted to the usual religious\nexercises.  Tommy stole away out of the tent, while Mr Seagrave was\nreading a sermon, to have a peep at the turtle-soup, which was boiling\non the fire; however, Juno suspected him, and had hold of him just as he\nwas taking the lid off the pot.  He was well scolded, and very much\nfrightened lest he should have no soup for his dinner; however, as it\nwas not a very heavy offence, he was forgiven.\n\nIn the evening, William requested his father to renew the conversation\nabout the reasoning powers of animals.\n\n\"With pleasure, William,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"it is a fit discourse\nfor a Sunday evening.  Let us, however, first examine the various mental\nfaculties discoverable in animals.  In the first place, they have\nmemory, especially memory of persons and places, quite as tenacious as\nour own.  A dog will recognise an old master after many years absence.\nAn elephant, who had again escaped into the woods, after twenty years\nremaining in a wild state, recognised his old mahoot, or driver.  A dog\nwill find his way back when taken more than a hundred miles from his\nmaster's residence.  Another proof of memory in animals, were it\nrequired, is that they dream.  Now, a dream is a confused recollection\nof past events; and how often do you not hear Romulus and Remus\ngrowling, barking, and whining in their sleep!\"\n\n\"Very true, papa.\"\n\n\"Well, then, they have attention.  See how patiently a cat will remain\nfor hours before a hole, in watch for the mouse to come out.  A spider\nwill remain for months watching for the fly to enter its web; but this\nquality is to be observed in every animal in the pursuit of its prey.\nThey have also association of ideas, which is, in fact, reasoning.  A\ndog proves that; he will allow a gentleman to come up to the door, but\nfly at a beggar.  When he is in charge of any property he will take no\nnotice of a passer-by; but if a man stops, he barks immediately.  In the\nelephant this association of ideas is even more remarkable; indeed, he\nunderstands what is said to him better than any other animal; his\nreasoning powers are most extraordinary.  Promise him rewards, and he\nwill make wonderful exertion.  He is also extremely alive to a sense of\nshame.  The elephants were employed to transport the heavy artillery in\nIndia.  One of the finest attempted in vain to force a gun through a\nswamp.  `Take away that lazy beast,' said the director `and bring\nanother.'  The animal was so stung with the reproach, that it used so\nmuch exertion to force the gun on with its head, as to fracture its\nskull, and it fell dead.  When Chunee, the elephant which was so long in\nExeter Change, was ordered as usual to take up a sixpence with his\ntrunk, it happened one day that the sixpence rolled against the\nskirting-board, out of his reach.  Chunee stopped, and reflected a\nlittle while, and then, drawing the air into his trunk, he threw it out\nwith all his force against the skirting-board; the rebound of the air\nfrom the skirting-board blew the sixpence towards him, and he was\nenabled to reach it.\"\n\n\"That was very clever of him,\" replied William.\n\n\"Yes; it was a proof of thought, with a knowledge of cause and effect.\nThere was a curious instance of a horse, which, by the bye, I consider\nthe most noble animal of creation, which was ridden round by his master,\nto deliver newspapers.  He invariably stopped at the doors where papers\nwere to be left; but it happened that two people, living at different\nhouses, took in a weekly newspaper between them; and it was agreed, that\none should have the first reading of it on one week, and the other on\nthe following.  After a short time the horse became accustomed to this\narrangement, and stopped at the one house on the one week, and at the\nother house on the following, never making a mistake.\"\n\n\"That was very curious; what a sagacious animal he must have been!\"\nobserved William.\n\n\"Animals also are, as you know, capable of receiving instruction, which\nis another proof of reasoning powers.  The elephant, the horse, the dog,\nthe pig, even birds may be taught a great deal.\"\n\n\"But then, papa, I still wish to know where the line is to be drawn\nbetween reason and instinct.\"\n\n\"I was about to come to that very point, William.  When animals follow\ntheir instinct in providing their food, bringing up their young, and in\ntheir precautions against danger, they follow certain fixed rules, from\nwhich they never deviate.  But circumstances may occur against which\ntheir instinct can afford them no regular provision; then it is that\ntheir reasoning powers are called into action.  I will explain this by\nstating a fact relative to the bee, one of the animals upon which\ninstinct is most powerful in its action.  There is a certain large moth,\ncalled the Death's-head moth, which is very fond of honey.  It sometimes\ncontrives to force its way through the aperture of the hive, and gain an\nentrance.  The bees immediately attack it, and it is soon destroyed by\ntheir stings; but the carcass is so large, that they cannot carry it out\nof the hive, as they invariably do the bodies of the smaller insects\nwhich may have intruded, and it appears that their sense of smell is\nvery acute.  What, then, do they do to avoid the stench arising from the\ndead body of this large moth?  Why, they embalm it, covering it entirely\nwith wax, by which it no longer becomes offensive to them.\"\n\n\"But, papa, might not their instinct have provided for such an event?\"\nobserved William.\n\n\"If such an event could have occurred to the bees in their wild state,\nyou certainly might have raised the question; but recollect, William,\nthat bees in their wild state live in the hollows of trees, and that the\nhole by which they enter is never more than sufficiently large to admit\none bee at a time; consequently, no animal larger than a bee could gain\nentrance, and if it did, could of course have been easily removed from\nthe hive; but the bees were here in a new position, in an artificial\nstate, in a hive of straw with a large aperture, and therefore met with\nan exigence they were not prepared for, and acted accordingly.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa, I perceive the difference.\"\n\n\"I will conclude my observations with one remark.  It appears to me,\nthat although the Almighty has thought proper to vary the intellectual\nand the reasoning powers of animals in the same way that he has varied\nthe species and the forms, yet even in this arrangement he has not been\nunmindful of the interest and welfare of man.  For you will observe,\nthat the reasoning powers are chiefly, if not wholly, given to those\nanimals which man subjects to his service and for his use--the elephant,\nthe horse, and the dog; thereby making these animals of more value, as\nthe powers given to them are at the service and under the control of\nman.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 55.\n\nOn the Monday morning, William and Ready went away in the boat, as\nbefore, to bring round the various articles from the cove.  It had been\narranged that they were not to return till the Saturday evening, and\nthat the dog Remus was to bring intelligence of them and their welfare\nevery afternoon.  They worked hard during the week, and on Saturday they\nhad completed their task; with the exception of a portion of the timbers\nof the ship, everything had been brought round, but had not been carried\nup to the storehouse, as that required more time.\n\nOn Saturday morning, they went for the last time to the cove, and Ready\nselected some heavy oak timber out of the quantity which was lying on\nthe beach, part of which they put into the boat, and the remainder they\ntowed astern.  It was a heavy load, and although the wind was fair to\nsail back again to the bay, the boat went but slowly through the water.\n\n\"Well, William,\" said Ready, \"we have done a good week's work, and I\nmust say it is high time that it is done; for the boat is in rather a\ncrazy condition, and I must contrive to patch her up by and by, when\nthere is time.\"\n\n\"We shall not want to use her very much after this, Ready,\" replied\nWilliam; \"a few trips round to the little harbour will be all that will\nbe required before we come back again to our old quarters.\"\n\n\"That's true, William; but she leaks very much, and at all events I'll\ngive her a coat of pitch as soon as possible.  For a slight-built little\nthing as she is, she has done hard duty.\"\n\n\"Pray, Ready, why, when you speak of a ship or boat, do you always call\nit she?\"\n\n\"Well, William, I don't know why, but it is certain that we sailors\nalways do so.  I believe it is because a sailor loves his ship.  His\nship is his wife, is a very common saying with us; and then you see,\nMaster William, a vessel is almost a thing of life in appearance.  I\nbelieve that's the reason, and of course if a vessel is she, a little\nboat must be a she also.\"\n\n\"Well, I think you have explained it very well, Ready.  I suppose on\nMonday we shall set to at the storehouse, and alter it for our future\nresidence?\"\n\n\"Can't begin too soon, William,\" replied Ready; \"I don't doubt but Mr\nSeagrave has finished the hedge and ditch round the yams by this time,\nand if so, I expect Madam will not like to be left in the tents alone\nwith Juno and the children, and so we shall all move back to the house\nagain until we have altered the storehouse; I must say that I would\nrather your mamma remained in the tents until all was finished.\"\n\n\"Because you are afraid of a visit from the savages, Ready?\"\n\n\"I am, sir, and that's the truth.\"\n\n\"But, Ready, if they do come, we shall see them coming, and would it not\nbe better that we should all be together, even if we are obliged to\nconceal ourselves in consequence of not being prepared?  Suppose the\nsavages were to overrun the island, and find my mother, my little\nbrother, and sister, defenceless, at the time we were obliged to retreat\nfrom our house; how dreadful that would be!\"\n\n\"But I counted upon retreating to the tents.\"\n\n\"So we can all together, unless we are surprised in the night.\"\n\n\"That we must take care not to be.  There's not three hours' dark in\nthis season of the year.  Well, William, I doubt not you may be right,\nand if they are all with us, Juno will be a great help, and we shall get\nthrough our work the faster.\"\n\n\"We had better let the question be decided by my father and mother.\"\n\n\"Very true, William; here's the point at last.  We will haul the timber\non the beach, and then be off as fast as we can, for it is getting\nlate.\"\n\nIt was, indeed, much later than they had usually arrived at the little\nharbour, owing to the heavy load, which made the boat so long in coming\nround from the cove; and when they pulled in, they found Mr and Mrs\nSeagrave and the children all waiting for them.\n\n\"You are very late, William,\" said Mrs Seagrave.  \"I was quite uneasy\ntill I saw the boat at a distance.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma; but we could not help it; we had a heavy load to bring\nround, and now our work is done.\"\n\n\"I am delighted to hear it, William; for I cannot bear you being away so\nlong.\"\n\n\"And my work is done,\" said Mr Seagrave; \"the hedge and ditch were\nfinished this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" observed Ready, \"we must hold another council, but I\npresume it will not take very long.\"\n\n\"No; I expect not; it seldom does when people are of the same mind.\nMrs Seagrave won't be left here, Ready, and I don't want to leave her,\nso I presume on Monday we all start home again.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; if you please,\" replied Ready.\n\n\"Juno, I hope you have a good supper,\" said William; \"for I'm very\nhungry.\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa William; plenty fried fish; Massa catch 'em this morning.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 56.\n\nThe next day being Sunday was a day of repose, and as they had all\nworked so hard, they felt the luxury of a day of rest.  In the\nafternoon, they agreed that on Monday they should make every preparation\nfor quitting the tents, and returning to the house at the bay.  They\ndecided that the live stock should all be left there, as the pasturage\nwas so plentiful and good, with the exception of one goat, which they\nwould take back with them, to supply them with milk; and they also\nagreed that the tents should be left standing, with some cooking\nutensils, that in case William and Ready went round for the bananas or\nyams, or to examine the live stock, they should not be compelled to\nsleep in the open air, and should have the means of dressing their\ndinner.  William and Ready were to carry the beds, etcetera, round to\nthe bay in the boat, which they could do in two trips, and Mr and Mrs\nSeagrave, with the family, were to walk through the woods after taking a\nvery early breakfast.\n\nAll these points being arranged, they had finished their supper, when\nWilliam again brought up the conversation about animals, as he was\ndelighted to bear Mr Seagrave talk on the subject.  The conversation\nhad not commenced more than a few minutes, when William said--\n\n\"Papa, they always say `as stupid as an ass.'  Is an ass such a stupid\nanimal?\"\n\n\"No, William; it is a very sagacious one; but the character has been\ngiven to the animal more on account of its obstinacy and\nuntractableness, than on any other account.  It is usual to say, as\nstupid as an ass, or as stupid as a pig, or a goose.  Now, these three\nanimals are very much maligned, for they are all sagacious animals.  But\nthe fact is that, as regards the ass, we have only very sorry specimens\nof the animal in England; they are stunted and small, and, from want of\ncorn and proper food, besides being very ill-treated, are slow and\ndull-looking animals.  The climate of England is much too cold for the\nass; in the south of France and the Mediterranean, where it is much\nwarmer, the ass is a much finer animal; but to see it in perfection we\nmust go to the Torrid Zone in Guinea, right on the equator, the hottest\nportion of the globe, where the ass, in its native state and in its\nnative country, is a handsome creature and as fleet as the wind; indeed,\nsupposed to be, and mentioned in the Scriptures as the fleetest animal\nin creation.  The fact is, that in Asia, especially in Palestine and\nSyria, asses were in great repute, and used in preference to horses.  We\nmust see an animal in its own climate to form a true estimate of its\nvalue.\"\n\n\"Does climate, then, make so great a difference?\" said William.\n\n\"Of course it does, not only with animals, but with trees, plants, and\neven man, until he is accustomed to the change.  With respect to\nanimals, there are some which can bear the different varieties of\nclimate, and even change of food.  The horse, for instance, although\noriginally indigenous to Arabia, lives as well in the Temperate, and\neven in the Frigid Zones it may be said, for they endure the hard\nwinters of Russia and North America; so will domestic cattle, such as\ncows, sheep, pigs, etcetera.  It is a curious fact that, during the\nwinter in Canada, a large proportion of the food of cattle consists of\n_fish_.\"\n\n\"Fish, papa!  Cows eat fish?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear boy, such is the fact.  It is a remarkable instance of a\ngraminivorous or grass-eating animal being changed for a time into a\nflesh-eating, or rather into fish-eating animal.  But there are other\nanimals which can live under any temperature, as the wolf, the fox, the\nhare, and rabbit.  It is a curious provision,--that the sheep and goats\nin the hottest climates throw off their warm covering of wool, and\nretain little better than hair; while, removed to a cold climate, they\nrecover their warm covering immediately.\"\n\n\"But a goat has no wool, papa.\"\n\n\"What are Cashmere shawls made of, William?\"\n\n\"Very true, papa.\"\n\n\"Most animals have a certain increase of covering as they recede further\nfrom the warm climates to the cold ones.  Wolves and foxes, hares and\nrabbits, change the colour of their skins to white when they get far\nnorth.  The little English stoat, which is destroyed by the gamekeepers,\nbecomes the beautiful snow-white ermine in Russia and other cold\ncountries.\"\n\n\"Well, papa, I think it a great advantage to man, and a proof of the\nAlmighty's care of him and kindness to him, in permitting all the\nanimals most useful to him to be able to live in any country; but I\ndon't know whether I am wrong in saying so, papa: I cannot see why an\nanimal like the wolf should not have been kept to his own climate, like\nthe lion and tiger, and other ferocious animals.\"\n\n\"You have started a question, William, which I am glad you have done,\nrather than it should have remained on your mind, and have puzzled you.\nIt is true that the shepherd might agree with you, that the wolf is a\nnuisance; equally true that the husbandman may exclaim, What is the good\nof thistles, and the various weeds which choke the soil?  But, my dear\nboy, if they are not, which I think they are, for the benefit of man, at\nall events they are his doom for the first transgression.  `Cursed is\nthe ground for thy sake--thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to\nthee--and by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,' was the\nAlmighty's sentence; and it is only by labour that the husbandman can\nobtain his crops, and by watchfulness that the shepherd can guard his\nflocks.  Labour is in itself a benefit: without exercise there would be\nno health, and without health there would be no enjoyment.\"\n\n\"I see now, papa.  You have mentioned the animals which can live in all\nclimates; will you not tell us something about other animals?\"\n\n\"There is but one remark to make, William, which is, that animals\nindigenous to, that is, originally to be found in, any one portion of\nthe globe, invariably are so fashioned as to be most fit for that\ncountry, and have the food also most proper for them growing or to be\nobtained in that country.  Take, for instance, the camel, an animal\nfashioned expressly for the country to which he is indigenous, and\nwithout whose aid all communication must have been stopped between Asia\nand Africa.  He is called the `Ship of the Desert;' for the desert is a\n`sea of sand.'  His feet are so fashioned that he can traverse the sands\nwith facility; he can live upon the coarsest vegetable food and salt\nplants which are found there, and he has the capacity of carrying water\nin a sort of secondary stomach, for his own supply where no water is to\nbe found.  Here is an animal wonderfully made by the Almighty for an\nexpress locality, and for the convenience of man in that country; for,\nin England, or elsewhere, he would be of no value.  But it is late, my\ndear William; so we will first thank Him for all his mercies, and then\nto bed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 57.\n\nThe next morning was one of bustle; there was packing up and every\npreparation for departure.  Juno was called here and called there, and\nwas obliged to ask little Caroline to look after the kettle and call to\nher if it boiled over.  Master Tommy, as usual, was in every one's way,\nand doing more harm than good in his attempts to assist.\n\nAt last, Ready, to get rid of him, sent him down with a large bundle to\nthe beach.  Tommy shouldered it with great importance, but when he came\nback, looking rather warm with the exertion, and Ready asked him to take\ndown another, he said he was too tired, and sat down very quietly till\nbreakfast-time, before which everything was ready.\n\nMrs Seagrave and Juno packed up the breakfast and dinner things in a\nbasket after breakfast was over, and then Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the\nfamily set off on their journey, accompanied by the dogs, through the\ncocoa-nut grove.\n\nWilliam and Ready lost no time in getting through their work; the\ncrockery, kitchen utensils, table, and chairs, were the first articles\nput into the boat.  The goat was then led down, and they set off with a\nfull load, and arrived at the bay long before the party who were walking\nthrough the wood.  They landed the things on the beach, and then shoved\noff again to bring round the bedding, which was all that was left.  By\nthree o'clock in the afternoon they had arrived at the bay with their\nsecond and last load, and found that the other party had been there\nabout an hour, and Mr Seagrave and Juno were very busy taking the\narticles up from the beach.\n\n\"Well, William,\" said Ready, \"this is our last trip for some time, I\nexpect; and so much the better, for our little boat must have something\ndone to her as soon as I can find time.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Ready, she has done her work well.  Do you know I feel as\nif I were coming home, now that we are back to the bay.  I really feel\nquite glad that we have left the tents.  I found the pigeons among the\npeas, Ready, so we must pick them as soon as we can.  I think there were\nnear twenty of them.  We shall have pigeon pies next year, I expect.\"\n\n\"If it pleases God that we live and do well,\" replied Ready, who had his\neyes fixed upon the sea.\n\nBefore night everything was in its place again in the house, and as\ncomfortable as before, and as they were very tired, they went very early\nto bed, having first arranged what they should do in the morning.  At\ndaylight Ready and William went down to the turtle-pond and speared a\nturtle, for now the time was coming on for turning the turtle again, and\nthe pond would soon be filled.  Having cut it up and put a portion of it\ninto the pot, all ready for Mrs Seagrave, as soon as breakfast was over\nthey proceeded to the storehouse.\n\nAfter a little consultation with Mr Seagrave, Ready marked out a square\nof cocoa-nut trees surrounding the storehouse, so as to leave a space\nwithin them of about twenty yards each side, which they considered large\nenough for the inclosure.  These cocoa-nut trees were to serve as the\nposts between which were to be fixed other cocoa-nut trees cut down, and\nabout fourteen feet high, so as to form a palisade or stockade, which\ncould not be climbed over, and would protect them from any attack of the\nsavages.\n\nAs soon as the line of trees had been marked out, they set to work\ncutting down all the trees within the line, and then outside to a\ndistance of ten yards, so as to give them room for their work.  Ready\ncut out cross-pieces, to nail from tree to tree, and now they found the\nadvantage of having saved so many of the large spike nails, without\nwhich they never could have made so good or so quick a job of it.  Mr\nSeagrave cut down trees, William and Juno sawed them off at a proper\nlength with one of the cross-cut saws, and then carried them to Ready.\nThey soon had more cut out than he could use, and then they dragged away\nthe tops and branches, and piled them at a distance on the ground, to\nuse as winter fuel, while Mr Seagrave helped Ready in fixing up the\npalisades.  They worked very hard that day, and were not sorry to go to\nbed.  Ready, however, took an opportunity to speak to William.\n\n\"I think,\" said he, \"that now we are here again, it will be necessary to\nkeep a sort of night-watch, in case of accident.  I shall not go to bed\ntill it is quite dark, which it will be by nine o'clock, and shall have\nmy glass to examine the offing the last thing.  You see, there is little\nfear of the savages coming here in the night-time, but they may just\nbefore night or very early in the morning, so one of us must be up again\nbefore daybreak, that is between two and three o'clock in the morning,\nto see if there is anything to be seen of them; if there is not, of\ncourse we may go to bed again, as they cannot arrive till many hours\nafterwards; and we must watch the wind and weather, if it is favourable\nfor them to come to us, which, indeed, the wind will not be except at\nthe commencement of the rainy season but it may be very light, and then\nthey would not care for its being against them.  I've been thinking of\nit, William, a great deal, and my idea is, that it will be at the\nbeginning of the rainy season that we shall have a visit, if we have one\nat all; for you see that the wind don't blow regular from one quarter,\nas it does now, but is variable, and then they can make sail in their\ncanoes, and come here easily, instead of pulling between thirty and\nforty miles, which is hard work against wind and current.  Still, we\nmust not be careless and we must keep a good look-out even now.  I don't\nwant to fret your father and Mrs Seagrave with my fears on the subject,\nbut I tell you what I really think, and what we ought to do.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Ready, and I will take care to be up before daybreak,\nand examine very carefully with the spy-glass as soon as the day dawns.\nYou take the night part, and I will do the morning part of the\nwatching.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 58.\n\nFor nearly a fortnight, the work upon the stockade continued without any\nintermission, when a circumstance occurred which created the greatest\nalarm and excitement.  One day, as the party returned to dinner, Mrs\nSeagrave said with surprise, \"Why, was not Tommy with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"he has not been near us all day; he went\nwith us after breakfast, but did not remain a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"No, Missy; I tell Massa Tommy to help carry cocoa-nut leaves, and then\nhe go away directly.\"\n\n\"Goodness! where can he be?\" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave, alarmed.\n\n\"I dare say he is picking up shells on the beach, ma'am,\" replied Ready,\n\"or perhaps he is in the garden.  I will go and see.\"\n\n\"I see him--oh, mercy!--I see him,\" said Juno, pointing with her finger;\n\"he in the boat, and boat go to sea!\"\n\nIt was but too true: there was Tommy in the boat, and the boat had\ndrifted from the beach, and was now a cable's length away from it, among\nthe breakers.\n\nWilliam ran off like the wind, followed close by Mr Seagrave and Ready,\nand at a distance by Mrs Seagrave and Juno; indeed, there was no time\nto be lost, for the wind was off the shore, and in a short time the boat\nwould have been out to sea.\n\nWilliam, as soon as he arrived at the beach, threw off his hat and\njacket and dashed into the water.  He was already up to his middle, when\nold Ready, who had followed him, caught him by the arm and said:\n\n\"William, go back immediately.  I insist upon it.  Your going can do no\ngood, as you do not understand the thing so well as I do; and go I will,\nso there will be double risk for nothing.  Mr Seagrave, order him back.\nHe will obey you.  I insist upon it, sir.\"\n\n\"William,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"come back immediately, I command you.\"\n\nWilliam obeyed, but before he was clear of the water Ready had swam\nacross to the first rocks on the reef, and was now dashing through the\npools between the rocks, towards the boat.\n\n\"Oh, father!\" said William, \"if that good old man is lost, I shall never\nforgive myself.  Look, father, one--two--three sharks, here, close to\nus.  He has no chance.  See, he is again in deep water.  God protect\nhim!\"\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Seagrave, whose wife was now by his side, after\nglancing his eye a moment at the sharks, which were within a few feet of\nthe beach, had kept his gaze steadily upon Ready's movements.  If he\npassed through the passage of deep water between the rocks he might be\nconsidered safe, as the boat was now beating on a reef on the other\nside, where the water was shallow.  It was a moment of intense anxiety.\nAt last Ready had gained the reef, and had his hands upon the rocks, and\nwas climbing on them.\n\n\"He is safe, is he not?\" whispered Mrs Seagrave faintly.\n\n\"Yes; now I think he is,\" replied Mr Seagrave, as Ready had gained a\nfooting on the rocks, where the water was but a little above his ankles.\n\"I think there is no deep water between him and the boat.\"\n\nIn another minute Ready was over the rocks, and had seized the gunnel of\nthe boat.\n\n\"He is in the boat,\" cried William.  \"Thank God!\"\n\n\"Yes, we must thank God, and that fervently,\" replied Mr Seagrave.\n\"Look at those monsters,\" continued he, pointing to the sharks; \"how\nquick they swim to and fro; they have scented their prey on the water.\nIt is fortunate they are here.\"\n\n\"See, he has the boat-hook, and is pushing the boat off the reef into\nthe deep water.  Oh! he is quite safe now.\"\n\nSuch, however, was not the case.  The boat had been beating on the rocks\nof the reef, and had knocked a hole in her bottom, and as soon as Ready\nhad forced the boat into deep water, she began to fill immediately.\nReady pushed as hard as he could with the boat-hook, and tearing off his\nneck-cloth, forced as much as he could of it into the hole.  This saved\nthem; but the boat was up to the thwarts with water, and the least\nmotion on the part of Ready, or even Tommy, would have upset her\nimmediately, and they had still to pass the deep water between the reef\nand the beach, where the sharks were swimming.  Ready, who perceived his\ndanger, called out to them to throw large stones at the sharks as fast\nas they could, to drive them away.  This was immediately done by Mr\nSeagrave and William, aided by Juno and Mrs Seagrave.\n\nThe pelting of the stones had the desired effect.  The sharks swam away,\nand Ready passed through to the beach, and the boat grounded just as she\nwas up to the gunnel in water, and about to turn over.  He handed out\nTommy, who was so dreadfully frightened that he could not cry.\n\nAs soon as Ready landed, William sprang into his arms, crying, \"Thank\nGod, you are safe, Ready!\"  Mrs Seagrave, overpowered by her feelings,\nsank her head upon William's shoulder, and burst into tears.\n\n\"It was touch and go, William,\" observed Ready, as they walked up to the\nhouse, preceded by Mr and Mrs Seagrave.  \"How much mischief may be\ncreated by a thoughtless boy!  However, one can't put old heads on young\nshoulders, and so Tommy must be forgiven.\"\n\n\"He has been punished enough, as far as fright goes,\" replied William;\n\"I'll answer for it, he'll never get into the boat again by himself.\"\n\n\"No, I think not.  But now, William, you saw how nearly I was swamped in\nthe boat; indeed, it was only by his mercy that I was preserved; but\ntaking the question merely as far as our endeavours could help us, do\nyou think that if you had gained the boat instead of me, you would have\nbrought her to the beach as I did?\"\n\n\"No, Ready; I never could have managed her so skilfully as you did, and\ntherefore I must have been swamped before I got on shore.\"\n\n\"Well, William, as I am an old sailor and you are not, therefore it is\nnot vanity which makes me say that you could not have managed the boat\nso well as I did.  Now, as I had not three or four seconds to spare,\nyou, as you say, must have been swamped.  I mention this to prove to you\nthat I was right in desiring your father to order you back.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Ready; but Tommy is my brother, and I felt that it was more\nmy duty than yours to risk my life for him.\"\n\n\"A very proper feeling, William; but you have other duties, which are,\nto look after your father and mother, and be a comfort and solace to\nthem.  Your life is more valuable than mine.  I am an old man on the\nbrink of the grave, and a year or two makes no difference, but your life\nis, I hope, of more consequence.\"\n\nThat evening the prayers were more than usually solemn, and the\nthanksgivings more heartfelt and sincere.  Exhausted with the exciting\nscene of the day, they all retired early to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 59.\n\nWhen Tommy was questioned on the following morning as to his inducement\nto get into the boat, to their great surprise he replied, that he wanted\nto go round to the tents again, to see if the bananas were ripe; that he\nintended to eat some of them and be back before dinner-time, that he\nmight not be found out.\n\n\"I suspect, Tommy, you would have been very hungry before you ate any\nbananas if we had not perceived you,\" said Ready.\n\n\"I won't go into the boat any more,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"I rather think you will keep to that resolution, Tommy,\" replied Mr\nSeagrave; \"however, I must leave your mother to point out to you the\ndanger you were in yourself, and in which you placed others by your\nfolly.\"\n\nThe stockade was now almost finished; the door was the occasion of a\ngood deal of consultation; at last, it was agreed that it would be\nbetter to have a door of stout oak plank, but with second door-posts\ninside, about a foot apart from the door, between which could be\ninserted short poles one above the other, so as to barricade it within\nwhen required.  This would make the door as strong as any other portion\nof the stockade.  As soon as this was all complete, the storehouse was\nto be altered for a dwelling-house, by taking away the wattles of\ncocoa-nut boughs on the sides, and filling them up with logs of\ncocoa-nut trees.\n\nBefore the week was ended the stockade and door were complete, and they\nnow began to fell trees, to form the sides of the house.  This was rapid\nwork; and while Mr Seagrave, William, and Juno felled the trees, and\nbrought them on the wheels to the side of the stockade, all ready cut to\ntheir proper lengths, Ready was employed in flooring the house with a\npart of the deal planks which they had brought round from the cove.  But\nthis week they were obliged to break off for two days, to collect all\ntheir crops from the garden.\n\nA fortnight more passed away in continual hard work, but the house was\nat last finished, and very complete, compared to the one they were\nresiding in.  It was much larger, and divided into three rooms by the\ndeal planking: the middle room which the door opened into was the\nsitting and eating room, with a window behind; the two side rooms were\nsleeping-rooms, one for Mrs Seagrave and the children, and the other\nfor the male portion of the family.\n\n\"See, William,\" said Ready, when they were alone, \"what we have been\nable to do by means of those deal planks; why, to have floored this\nhouse, and run up the partitions, would have taken us half a year if we\nhad had to saw the wood.\"\n\n\"Yes; and what a comfort it is to have so many shelves about.  When\nshall we shift into this house?\"\n\n\"The sooner the better.  We have plenty of work still to do, but we can\nwork outside of the stockade.\"\n\n\"And what do you propose to do with the old house?\" said William.\n\n\"We had better put some of our stores of least value in it for the\npresent, until we can fit up another storehouse inside the stockade.\"\n\n\"Then we'll put those casks in, for they take up a great deal of room.\"\n\n\"All but that large one, William; we shall want that.  I shall fix it up\nin a corner.\"\n\n\"What for, Ready?\"\n\n\"To put water in.\"\n\n\"But we are closer to the spring than we were at the other house.\"\n\n\"I know that; but, perhaps, we may not be able to go out of the\nstockade, and then we shall want water.\"\n\n\"I understand, Ready; how thoughtful you are!\"\n\n\"If at my age I did not think a little, William, it would be very odd.\nYou don't know how anxious I am to see them all inside of this defence.\"\n\n\"But why should we not come in, Ready?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, as there is still plenty of work, I do not like to press the\nmatter, lest your mamma should be fidgeted, and think there was danger;\nbut danger there is; I have a kind of forewarning of it.  I wish you\nwould propose that they should come in at once; the standing-bed places\nare all ready, except the canvas, and I shall nail on new by to-night.\"\n\nIn consequence of this conversation, William proposed at dinnertime that\nthe next day they should go into the new house, as it was so much more\nhandy to work there and live there at the same time.  Mr Seagrave was\nof the same opinion, but Mrs Seagrave thought it better that everything\nshould be tidy first.\n\n\"Why, ma'am,\" said Ready, \"the only way to get things tidy is to go\nyourself and make them so.  Nothing will ever be in its place unless you\nare there to put it in.\"\n\n\"Well, Ready,\" said Mrs Seagrave, \"since you are against me as well as\nall the rest, I give it up, and if you please we will shift over\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Indeed, ma'am, I think it will be better; this is the last month of\nfine weather, and we shall have plenty to do.\"\n\n\"Be it so, Ready; you are the best judge; to-morrow we will take up our\nquarters in the stockade.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" muttered Ready very softly.\n\nThe next day was fully employed in changing their residence, and\nshifting over the bedding and utensils; and that night they slept within\nthe stockade.  Ready had run up a very neat little outhouse of plank, as\na kitchen for Juno, and another week was fully employed as follows: the\nstores were divided; those of least consequence, and the salt\nprovisions, flour, and the garden produce, etcetera, were put into the\nold house; the casks of powder and most of the cartridges were also put\nthere for security; but a cask of beef, of pork, and flour, all the\niron-work and nails, canvas, etcetera, were stowed away for the present\nunder the new house, which had, when built as a storehouse, been raised\nfour feet from the ground to make a shelter for the stock.  This was\nvery spacious, and, of course, quite dry, and contained all they wished\nto put in.  Ready also took care, by degrees, to fill the large\nwater-butt full of water, and had fixed into the bottom a spigot for\ndrawing the water off.\n\n\"Well, Mr Seagrave,\" said Ready on the Saturday, \"we have done a good\nmany hard weeks' work lately, but this is the last of them.  We are now\ncomfortably settled in our new house: our stores are all under cover,\nand safe from the weather, and so we may now take things a little\neasier.  William and I must repair the boat, so that we may take a trip\nround to examine how the stock and yams get on.\"\n\n\"And the bananas and the guavas,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"Why, we have quite forgotten all about them,\" observed Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; we have been so busy, that it is no wonder; however, there\nmay be some left yet, and I will go round as soon as the boat is able to\nswim, and bring all I can find.\"\n\n\"We must put our seeds and potatoes in before the rainy season, Ready.\"\n\n\"It will be better, sir, if we can find time, as we shall not have much\nmore fine weather now; at all events, we can get them in at intervals\nwhen the weather is fine.  Now I shall go my rounds for turtle.\nGood-night, ma'am,--good-night, sir.  Come, William.\"\n\nWilliam and Ready succeeded in turning six more turtles to add to their\nstock, and having taken a careful survey with the telescope, they came\nback, fastened the door of the stockade, and went to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 60.\n\nAnother week passed away, during which Ready repaired the boat, and\nWilliam and Mr Seagrave were employed in digging up the garden.  It was\nalso a very busy week at the house, as they had not washed linen for\nsome time.  Mrs Seagrave and Juno, and even little Caroline were hard\nat work, and Tommy was more useful than ever he had been, going for the\nwater as they required it, and watching little Albert.  Indeed, he was\nso active, that Mrs Seagrave praised him before his papa, and Tommy was\nquite proud.\n\nOn the Monday William and Ready set off in the boat to the little\nharbour, and found all the stock doing well.  Many of the bananas and\nguavas had ripened and withered, but there were enough left to fill the\nboat half full.\n\n\"We cannot do better than to leave the stock where it is at present,\nWilliam; they can run into the cocoa-nut grove for shelter if there is a\nstorm, and there is feed enough for ten times as many.\"\n\n\"Yes; but will you not dig up a few yams first?\"\n\n\"I had quite forgotten it, William.  I will go for the spade.\"\n\nHaving procured the yams, they set off on their return.  Before they\narrived at the bay, the sky clouded over and threatened a storm.  It did\nnot, however, rain till after they had landed, when a small shower\nannounced the commencement of the rainy season.  The fruit was very\nwelcome to all of them, it was so long since they had tasted any.\n\nThe following day was beautifully fine, and everything appeared\nrefreshed by the rain which had fallen.  It was, however, agreed, that\nReady and William should go round the next morning, bring home the\ntents, and as many yams as the boat could carry.  William and Ready went\nout at night as usual, when Ready observed that the wind had chopped\nround to the eastward.\n\n\"That will be bad for us to-morrow, Ready,\" replied William.  \"We may\nsail to the harbour, but we shall have to pull back with the loaded\nboat.\"\n\n\"I trust it will be no worse than that, at all events,\" replied Ready;\n\"but we must now return, and go to bed.  I shall be up by daylight, so\nyou need not wake without you like.\"\n\n\"I can't help waking,\" replied William, \"and I shall, therefore, be up\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Very well, I am always glad of your company.\"\n\nThe next morning, just before the day dawned, Ready and William\nunfastened the door of the stockade, and went down to the beach.  The\nwind was still to the eastward, and blowing rather fresh, and the sky\nwas cloudy.  As the sun rose, Ready, as usual, had his telescope with\nhim, and looked through it at the offing to the eastward.  As he kept\nthe spy-glass to his eye for some time without speaking, William said:\n\n\"Do you see anything, Ready, that you look so long in that direction?\"\n\n\"Either my old eyes deceive me, or I fear that I do,\" replied Ready;\n\"but a few minutes more will decide.\"\n\nThere was a bank of clouds on the horizon to the eastward, but as soon\nas the sun had risen above them, Ready, who had the telescope fixed in\nthe same direction, said:\n\n\"Yes, William, I am right.  I thought that those dark patches I saw\nthere were brown grass sails.\"\n\n\"Sails of what, Ready?\" said William, hastily.\n\n\"Of the Indian canoes; I knew that they would come.  Take the glass and\nlook yourself; my eye is quite dim from straining it so long.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have them now,\" replied William, with his eye to the glass.  At\nlast he said:\n\n\"Why, there are twenty or thirty of them, Ready, at least.\"\n\n\"And with twenty or thirty men in each too, William.\"\n\n\"What must we do, Ready?  How frightened my poor mother will be!  I'm\nafraid we can do nothing against such a number.\"\n\n\"Yes, William, we can do a great deal, and we must do a great deal.\nThat there are hundreds of savages there is no doubt; but recollect that\nwe have a stockade, which they cannot easily climb over, and plenty of\nfirearms and ammunition, so that we can make a good fight of it, and\nperhaps beat them off, for they have nothing but clubs and spears.\"\n\n\"How fast they come down, Ready; why, they will be here in an hour.\"\n\n\"No, sir, nor in two hours either; those are very large canoes.\nHowever, there is no time to be lost.  While I watch them for a few\nminutes till I make them more clearly out, do you run up to the house\nand beckon your father to come down to me; and then, William, get all\nthe muskets ready, and bring the casks of powder, and of made-up\ncartridges, from the old house into the stockade.  Call Juno, and she\nwill help you.  We shall have time enough to do everything.  After you\nhave done that, you had better come down and join us.\"\n\nIn a very few minutes after William ran up to the house, Mr Seagrave\nmade his appearance.\n\n\"Ready, there is danger, I'm sure; William would not tell me, I presume,\nbecause he was afraid of alarming his mother.  What is it?\"\n\n\"It is, Mr Seagrave, that the savages are now coming down upon us in\nlarge force; perhaps five or six hundred of them; and that we shall have\nto defend ourselves with might and main.\"\n\n\"Do you think we have any chance against such a force?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, with God's help I have no doubt but that we shall beat them\noff; but we must fight hard, and for some days, I fear.\"\n\nMr Seagrave examined the fleet of canoes with the glass.  \"It is,\nindeed, dreadful odds to contend against.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but three muskets behind a stockade are almost a match for\nall their clubs and spears, provided none of us are wounded.\"\n\n\"Well, Ready, we must put our trust in the Lord, and do our best; I will\nsecond you to the utmost of my power, and William, I'm sure, will do his\nduty.\"\n\n\"I think, sir,\" said Ready, \"we had better not wait here any more, as we\nhave not long to prepare for them.  We have only to fix up some of our\nstrong deal planks on the inside of the stockade for us to stand upon\nwhen we are attacked, that we may see what the enemy is about, and be\nable to fire upon them.  But first we had better go to the old house,\nand take out what provisions and other articles we shall most want, and\nroll the casks into the stockade, for to the old house they will go\nfirst, and perhaps destroy everything in it.  The casks they certainly\nwill, for the sake of the iron hoops.  An hour's work will do a great\ndeal.  I believe we have everything we want in the stockade; Juno has\nher fuel, the large butt of water will last us two or three weeks at\nleast, and if we have time, we will get the wheels down, and spear a\ncouple of turtles for fresh provisions.\"\n\nThese observations were made as they walked up to the house.  As soon as\nthey arrived, they found William and Juno had just brought in the powder\nand cartridges.  Mr Seagrave went in to break the matter to his wife.\n\n\"I was told that I had to expect this, my dear,\" replied Mrs Seagrave,\n\"so that it has not come upon me altogether unawares, and anything that\na poor weak woman can do, I will.\"\n\n\"I am indeed greatly relieved,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"by finding you thus\nprepared and supported.  I shall feel no anxiety--but we have work to be\ndone.\"\n\nMr and Mrs Seagrave then joined William, Ready, and Juno, who had\nalready proceeded to the old house.  The children were all still in bed\nand asleep, so that there was no occasion for any one to watch them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 61.\n\nAs they could have a very good view of the canoes from where the old\nhouse stood, Ready examined them with his glass every time that he\nreturned from rolling up a cask to the stockade.  Every one worked hard;\neven Mrs Seagrave did all she could, either assisting in rolling the\ncasks, or carrying up what she was able to lift.  In an hour they had\ngot into the stockade all that they most cared for, and the canoes were\nstill about six or seven miles off.\n\n\"We have a good hour before they arrive, sir,\" said Ready, \"and even\nthen the reefs will puzzle them not a little; I doubt if they are\ndisembarked under two hours.  We have plenty of time for all we wish to\ndo.  Juno, go for the wheels, and William, come down with the spear, and\nwe will have some of the turtle into the stockade.  Mr Seagrave, I do\nnot require your assistance, so if you will have the kindness to get out\nthe muskets, and examine the flints, it will be as well.\"\n\n\"Yes; and then you have to load them,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.  \"Juno and\nI can do that at all events, ready for you to fire them.\"\n\n\"An excellent idea, madam,\" replied Ready.\n\nIn half an hour six turtles were brought up by Juno and William, and\nthen Ready followed them into the stockade.\n\nThey then rolled the casks, and upheaded them by the sides of the\nstockade, and fixed up deal planks to stand upon, just high enough to\nenable them to see over the top of the palisades, and to fire at the\nenemy.  Mrs Seagrave had been shown how to load a musket, and Juno was\nnow taught the same.\n\n\"Now, sir, we are all prepared,\" said Ready, \"and Madam and Juno can go\nand look a little after the children, and get breakfast.\"\n\nAs soon as the children were dressed, Mr Seagrave called Ready, who was\noutside, watching the canoes, and they went to their morning devotions,\nand prayed heartily for succour in this time of need.  They then\nbreakfasted in haste; for, as may be supposed, they were almost too\nanxious to eat.\n\n\"This suspense is worse than all,\" said Mrs Seagrave.  \"I wish now that\nthey were come.\"\n\n\"Shall I go to Ready and hear his report, my dear?--I will not be away\nthree minutes.\"\n\nIn a short time Mr Seagrave returned, saying that the canoes were close\nto the beach, that the savages evidently had a knowledge of the passages\nthrough the reefs, as they had steered right in, and had lowered their\nsails; that Ready and William were on the look-out, but concealed behind\nthe cocoa-nut trees.\n\n\"I hope they will not stay out too long.\"\n\n\"No fear of that, my dear Selina; but they had better watch their\nmotions to the last minute.\"\n\nDuring this conversation between Mr and Mrs Seagrave within the\nstockade, William and Ready were watching the motions of the savages, a\nlarge portion of whom had landed out of ten of the canoes, and the\nothers were following their example as fast as they could, forcing their\nway through the reefs.  The savages were all painted, with their\nwar-cloaks and feathers on, and armed with spears and clubs, evidently\nhaving come with no peaceable intentions.\n\nWilliam, who had taken the telescope to examine them more minutely, said\nto Ready, \"What a fierce, cruel set of wretches they appear to be; if\nthey overpower us they will certainly kill us!\"\n\n\"Of that there is no doubt, William; but we must fight hard, and not let\nthem overpower us.  Kill us they certainly will, and I am not sure that\nthey may not eat us afterwards; but that is of little consequence.\"\n\nWilliam replied in a determined tone, \"I'll fight as long as I have\nbreath in my body; but, Ready, they are coming up as fast as they can.\"\n\n\"Yes; we must wait no longer.  Come, William.\"\n\n\"I thought I saw another vessel under sail, out away by the garden\npoint, Ready, just as we turned away.\"\n\n\"Very likely, sir, a canoe which has separated from the others during\nthe night.  Come, quick, William, they have begun to yell.\"\n\nAnother half-minute, and they arrived at the door of the stockade; they\nentered, shut the door, and then barricaded it with the cocoa-nut poles\nwhich they had fitted to the inner door-posts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 62.\n\nThe loud yells of the savages struck terror into the heart of Mrs\nSeagrave; it was well that she had not seen their painted bodies and\nfierce appearance, or she would have been much more alarmed.  Little\nAlbert and Caroline clung around her neck with terror in their faces;\nthey did not cry, but looked round and round to see from whence the\nhorrid noise proceeded, and then clung faster to their mother.  Tommy\nwas very busy, finishing all the breakfast which had been left, for\nthere was no one to check him as usual; Juno was busy outside, and was\nvery active and courageous.  Mr Seagrave had been employed making the\nholes between the palisades large enough to admit the barrels of the\nmuskets, so that they could fire at the savages without being exposed;\nwhile William and Ready, with their muskets loaded, were on the look-out\nfor their approach.\n\n\"They are busy with the old house just now, sir,\" observed Ready, \"but\nthat won't detain them long.\"\n\n\"Here they come,\" replied William; \"and look, Ready, is not that one of\nthe women who escaped from us in the canoe, who is walking along with\nthe first two men?  Yes, it is, I am sure.\"\n\n\"You are right, William, it is one of them.  Ah! they have stopped; they\ndid not expect the stockade, that is clear, and it has puzzled them; see\nhow they are all crowding together and talking; they are holding a\ncouncil of war how to proceed; that tall man must be one of their\nchiefs.  Now, William, although I intend to fight as hard as I can, yet\nI always feel a dislike to begin first; I shall therefore show myself\nover the palisades, and if they attack me, I shall then fire with a\nquiet conscience.\"\n\n\"But take care they don't hit you, Ready.\"\n\n\"No great fear of that, William.  Here they come.\"\n\nReady now stood upon the plank within, so as to show himself to the\nsavages, who gave a tremendous yell, and as they advanced a dozen spears\nwere thrown at him with so true an aim that, had he not instantly dodged\nbehind the stockade, he must have been killed.  Three or four spears\nremained quivering in the palisades, just below the top; the others went\nover it, and fell down inside of the stockade, at the further end.\n\n\"Now, William, take good aim;\" but before William could fire, Mr\nSeagrave, who had agreed to be stationed at the corner so that he might\nsee if the savages went round to the other side, fired his musket, and\nthe tall chief fell to the ground.\n\nReady and William also fired, and two more of the savages were seen to\ndrop amidst the yells of their companions.  Juno handed up the other\nmuskets which were ready loaded, and took those discharged, and Mrs\nSeagrave, having desired Caroline to take care of her little brother,\nand Tommy to be very quiet and good, came out, turned the key of the\ndoor upon them, and hastened to assist Juno in reloading the muskets.\n\nThe spears now rushed through the air, and it was well that they could\nfire from the stockade without exposing their persons, or they would\nhave had but little chance.  The yells increased, and the savages now\nbegan to attack on every quarter; the most active, who climbed like\ncats, actually succeeded in gaining the top of the palisades, but, as\nsoon as their heads appeared above, they were fired at with so true an\naim that they dropped down dead outside.  This combat lasted for more\nthan an hour, when the savages, having lost a great many men, drew off\nfrom the assault, and the parties within the stockade had time to\nbreathe.\n\n\"They have not gained much in this bout, at all events,\" said Ready; \"it\nwas well fought on our side, and William, you certainly behaved as if\nyou had been brought up to it.\"\n\n\"Do you think they will go away now?\" said Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"Oh, no, madam, not yet; they will try us every way before they leave\nus.  You see these are very brave men, and it is clear that they know\nwhat gunpowder is, or they would have been more astonished.\"\n\n\"I should think so too,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"the first time that\nsavages hear the report of firearms, they are usually thrown into great\nconsternation.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but such has not been the case with these people, and\ntherefore I reckon it is not the first time that they have fought with\nEuropeans.\"\n\n\"Are they all gone, Ready?\" said William, who had come down from the\nplank to his mother.\n\n\"No; I see them between the trees now; they are sitting round in a\ncircle, and, I suppose, making speeches.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm very thirsty, at all events,\" said William; \"Juno, bring me a\nlittle water.\"\n\nJuno went to the water-tub to comply with William's request, and in a\nfew moments afterwards came back in great consternation.\n\n\"Oh, Massa! oh, Missy! no water; water all gone!\"\n\n\"Water all gone!\" cried Ready and all of them in a breath.\n\n\"Yes; not one little drop in the cask.\"\n\n\"I filled it up to the top!\" exclaimed Ready very gravely; \"the tub did\nnot leak, that I am sure of; how can this have happened?\"\n\n\"Missy, I tink I know now,\" said Juno; \"you remember you send Massa\nTommy, the two or three days we wash, to fetch water from the well in\nlittle bucket.  You know how soon he come back, and how you say what\ngood boy he was, and how you tell Massa Seagrave when he come to dinner.\nNow, Missy, I quite certain Massa Tommy no take trouble go to well, but\nfetch water from tub all the while, and so he empty it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're right, Juno,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.  \"What shall we\ndo?\"\n\n\"I go speak Massa Tommy,\" said Juno, running to the house.\n\n\"This is a very awkward thing, Mr Seagrave,\" observed Ready gravely.\n\nMr Seagrave shook his head.\n\nThe fact was, that they all perceived the danger of their position: if\nthe savages did not leave the island, they would perish of thirst or\nhave to surrender; and in the latter case, all their lives would most\ncertainly be sacrificed.\n\nJuno now returned: her suspicions were but too true.  Tommy, pleased\nwith the praise of being so quick in bringing the water, had taken out\nthe spigot of the cask, and drawn it all off.\n\n\"Well,\" observed Mr Seagrave, \"it is the will of Heaven that all our\ncareful arrangements and preparations against this attack should be\ndefeated by the idleness of a child, and we must submit.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir,\" replied Ready; \"all our hopes now are that the savages\nmay be tired out, and leave the island.\"\n\n\"If I had but a little for the children, I should not care,\" observed\nMrs Seagrave; \"but to see those poor things suffer--is there not a drop\nleft, Juno, anywhere?\"\n\nJuno shook her head.\n\nMrs Seagrave said she would go and examine, and went away into the\nhouse accompanied by Juno.\n\n\"This is a very bad business, Ready,\" observed Mr Seagrave.  \"What\nwould we give for a shower of rain now, that we might catch the falling\ndrops!\"\n\n\"There are no signs of it, sir,\" replied Ready; \"we must, however, put\nour confidence in One who will not forsake us.\"\n\n\"I wish the savages would come on again,\" observed William; \"for the\nsooner they come, the sooner the affair will be decided.\"\n\n\"I doubt if they will to-day; at night-time I think it very probable.\nWe must make preparations for it.\"\n\n\"Why, what can we do, Ready?\"\n\n\"In the first place, sir, by nailing planks from cocoa-nut tree to\ncocoa-nut tree above the present stockade, we may make a great portion\nof it much higher, and more difficult to climb over.  Some of them were\nnearly in, this time.  If we do that, we shall not have so large a space\nto watch over and defend; and then we must contrive to have a large fire\nready for lighting, that we may not have to fight altogether in the\ndark.  It will give them some advantage in looking through the\npalisades, and seeing where we are, but they cannot well drive their\nspears through, so it is no great matter.  We must make the fire in the\ncentre of the stockade, and have plenty of tar in it, to make it burn\nbright, and we must not, of course, light it until after we are\nattacked.  We shall then see where they are trying for an entrance, and\nwhere to aim with our muskets.\"\n\n\"The idea is very good, Ready,\" said Mr Seagrave; \"if it had not been\nfor this unfortunate want of water, I really should be sanguine of\nbeating them off.\"\n\n\"We may suffer very much, Mr Seagrave, I have no doubt; but who knows\nwhat the morrow may bring forth?\"\n\n\"True, Ready.  Do you see the savages now?\"\n\n\"No, sir; they have left the spot where they were in consultation.  I\nsuppose they are busy with their wounded and their dead.\"\n\nAs Ready had supposed, no further attack was made by the savages on that\nday, and he, William, and Mr Seagrave, were very busy making their\narrangements; they nailed the planks on the trunks of the trees above\nthe stockade, so as to make three sides of the stockade at least five\nfeet higher, and almost impossible to climb up; and they prepared a\nlarge fire in a tar-barrel full of cocoa-nut leaves mixed with wood and\ntar, so as to burn fiercely.  Dinner or supper they had none, for there\nwas nothing but salt pork and beef and live turtle, and, by Ready's\nadvice, they did not eat, as it would only increase their desire to\ndrink.\n\nThe poor children suffered much; and little Albert wailed and cried for\n\"water, water.\"  Ready remained on the look-out; indeed, everything was\nso miserable inside of the house, that they were all glad to go out of\nit; they could do no good, and poor Mrs Seagrave had a difficult and\nmost painful task to keep the children quiet under such severe\nprivation, for the weather was still very warm and sultry.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 63.\n\nBut the moaning of the children was very soon after dusk drowned by the\nyells of the savages, who, as Ready had prognosticated, now advanced to\nthe night attack.\n\nEvery part of the stockade was at once assailed, and their attempts now\nmade were to climb into it; a few spears were occasionally thrown, but\nit was evident that the object was to obtain an entrance by dint of\nnumbers.  It was well that Ready had taken the precaution of nailing the\ndeal planks above the original stockade, or there is little doubt but\nthat the savages would have gained their object; as it was, before the\nflames of the fire, which Juno had lighted by Ready's order, gave them\nsufficient light, three or four savages had climbed up and had been shot\nby William and Mr Seagrave, as they were on the top of the stockade.\n\nWhen the fire burnt brightly, the savages outside were more easily aimed\nat, and a great many fell in their attempts to get over.  The attack\ncontinued more than an hour, when at last, satisfied that they could not\nsucceed, the savages once more withdrew, carrying with them, as before,\ntheir dead and wounded.\n\n\"I trust that they will now re-embark, and leave the island,\" said Mr\nSeagrave.\n\n\"I only wish they may, sir; it is not at all impossible; but there is no\nsaying.  I have been thinking, Mr Seagrave, that we might be able to\nascertain their movements by making a look-out.  You see, sir, that\ncocoa-nut tree,\" continued Ready, pointing to one of those to which the\npalisades were fastened, \"is much taller than any of the others: now, by\ndriving spike-nails into the trunk at about a foot apart, we might\nascend it with ease, and it would command a view of the whole bay; we\nthen could know what the enemy were about.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is very true; but will not anyone be very much exposed if he\nclimbs up?\"\n\n\"No, sir; for you see the cocoa-nut trees are cut down clear of the\npalisades to such a distance, that no savage could come at all near\nwithout being seen by anyone on the look-out, and giving us sufficient\ntime to get down again before he could use his spear.\"\n\n\"I believe that you are right there, Ready; but at all events I would\nnot attempt to do it before daylight, as there may be some of them still\nlurking underneath the stockade.\"\n\n\"Certainly there may be, sir, and therefore until daylight we will not\nbegin.\"\n\nMr Seagrave then went into the house; Ready desired William to lie down\nand sleep for two or three hours, as he would watch.  In the morning,\nwhen Mr Seagrave came out, he would have a little sleep himself.\n\n\"I can't sleep, Ready.  I'm mad with thirst,\" replied William.\n\n\"Yes, sir; it's very painful--I feel it myself very much, but what must\nthose poor children feel?  I pity them most.\"\n\n\"I pity my mother most, Ready,\" replied William; \"it must be agony to\nher to witness their sufferings, and not be able to relieve them.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, it must be terrible, William, to a mother's feelings; but\nperhaps these savages will be off to-morrow, and then we shall forget\nour privations.\"\n\n\"I trust in God that they may, Ready, but they seem very determined.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; iron is gold to them, and what will civilised men not do for\ngold?\"\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Seagrave had gone into the house.  He found the\nchildren still crying for water, notwithstanding the coaxing and\nsoothing of Mrs Seagrave, who was shedding tears as she hung over poor\nlittle Albert.  Little Caroline only drooped, and said nothing.  Mr\nSeagrave remained for two or three hours with his wife, assisting her in\npacifying the children, and soothing her to the utmost of his power; at\nlast he went out and found old Ready on the watch.\n\n\"Ready, I had rather a hundred times be attacked by these savages and\nhave to defend this place, than be in that house for even five minutes,\nand witness the sufferings of my wife and children.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt it, sir,\" replied Ready; \"but cheer up, and let us hope\nfor the best; I think it very probable that the savages after this\nsecond defeat will leave the island.\"\n\n\"I wish I could think so, Ready; it would make me very happy; but I have\ncome out to take the watch, Ready.  Will you not sleep for a while?\"\n\n\"I will, sir, if you please, take a little sleep.  Call me in two hours;\nit will then be daylight, and I can go to work, and you can get some\nrepose yourself.\"\n\n\"I am too anxious to sleep; I think so, at least.\"\n\n\"William said he was too thirsty to sleep, sir, but, poor fellow, he is\nnow fast enough.\"\n\n\"I trust that boy will be spared, Ready.\"\n\n\"I hope so too; but we are all in the hands of the Almighty.\"\n\nMr Seagrave took his station on the plank, and was left to his own\nreflections; that they were not of the most pleasant kind may easily be\nimagined.  He prayed earnestly and fervently that they might be\ndelivered from the danger and sufferings which threatened them, and\nbecame calm and tranquil; prepared for the worst, if the worst was to\nhappen, and confidently placing himself and his family under the care of\nhim who orders all as he thinks best.\n\nAt daylight Ready woke up and relieved Mr Seagrave, who did not return\nto the house, but lay down on the cocoa-nut boughs, where Ready had been\nlying by the side of William.  As soon as Ready had got out the\nspike-nails and hammer, he summoned William to his assistance, and they\ncommenced driving them into the cocoa-nut tree, one looking out in case\nof the savages approaching, while the other was at work.  In less than\nan hour they had gained the top of the tree close to the boughs, and had\na very commanding view of the bay, as well as inland.  William, who was\ndriving the last dozen spikes, took a survey, and then came down to\nReady.\n\n\"I can see everything, Ready: they have pulled down the old house\naltogether, and are most of them lying down outside, covered up with\ntheir war-cloaks; some women are walking to and fro from the canoes,\nwhich are lying on the beach where they first landed.\"\n\n\"They have pulled down the house to obtain the iron nails, I have no\ndoubt,\" replied Ready.  \"Did you see any of their dead?\"\n\n\"No; I did not look about very much, but I will go up again directly.  I\ncame down because my hands were jarred with hammering, and the hammer\nwas so heavy to carry.  In a minute or two I shall go up light enough.\nMy lips are burning, Ready, and swelled; the skin is peeling off.  I had\nno idea that want of water would have been so dreadful.  I was in hopes\nof finding a cocoa-nut or two on the tree, but there was not one.\"\n\n\"And if you had found one, it would not have had any milk in it at this\nseason of the year.  However, William, if the savages do not go away\nto-day, something must be done.  I wish now that you would go up again,\nand see if they are not stirring.\"\n\nWilliam again mounted to the top of the tree, and remained up for some\nminutes; when he came down, he said, \"They are all up now, and swarming\nlike bees.  I counted 260 of the men in their war-cloaks and feather\nhead-dresses; the women are passing to and fro from the well with water;\nthere is nobody at the canoes except eight or ten women, who are beating\ntheir heads, I think, or doing something of the kind.  I could not make\nit out well, but they seem all doing the same thing.\"\n\n\"I know what they are about, William: they are cutting themselves with\nknives or other sharp instruments.  It is the custom of these people.\nThe dead are all put into the canoes, and these women are lamenting over\nthem; perhaps they are going away, since the dead are in the canoes, but\nthere is no saying.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 64.\n\nThe second day was passed in keeping a look-out upon the savages, and\nawaiting a fresh attack.  They could perceive from the top of the\ncocoa-nut tree that the savages held a council of war in the forenoon,\nsitting round in a large circle, while one got up in the centre and made\na speech, flourishing his club and spear while he spoke.  In the\nafternoon the council broke up, and the savages were observed to be very\nbusy in all directions, cutting down the cocoa-nut trees, and collecting\nall the brushwood.\n\nReady watched them for a long while, and at last came down a little\nbefore sunset.  \"Mr Seagrave,\" said he, \"we shall have, in my opinion,\nno attack this night, but to-morrow we must expect something very\nserious; the savages are cutting down the trees, and making large\nfaggots; they do not get on very fast, because their hatchets are made\nof stone and don't cut very well, but perseverance and numbers will\neffect everything, and I dare say that they will work all night till\nthey have obtained as many faggots as they want.\"\n\n\"But what do you imagine to be their object, Ready, in cutting down\ntrees, and making the faggots?\"\n\n\"Either, sir, to pile them up outside the palisades, so large as to be\nable to walk up upon them, or else to pile them up to set fire to them,\nand burn us out.\"\n\n\"Do you think they will succeed?\"\n\n\"Not without very heavy loss; perhaps we may best them off, but it will\nbe a hard fight; harder than any we have had yet.  We must have the\nwomen to load the muskets, so that we may fire as fast as we can.  I\nshould not think much of their attempt to burn us, if it were not for\nthe smoke.  Cocoa-nut wood, especially with the bark on, as our\npalisades have, will char a long while, but not burn easily when\nstanding upright; and the fire, when the faggots are kindled, although\nit will be fierce, will not last long.\"\n\n\"But suffering as we are now, Ready, for want of water, how can we\npossibly keep up our strength to meet them in a suffocating smoke and\nflame? we must drop with sheer exhaustion.\"\n\n\"We must hope for the best, and do our best, Mr Seagrave,\" replied\nReady; \"and recollect that should anything happen to me during the\nconflict, and if there is any chance of your being overpowered, you must\ntake advantage of the smoke to escape into the woods, and find your way\nto the tents.  I have no doubt that you will be able to do that; of\ncourse the attack will be to windward if they use fire, and you must try\nand escape to leeward; I have shown William how to force a palisade if\nnecessary.  The savages, if they get possession, will not think of\nlooking for you at first, and, perhaps, when they have obtained all that\nthe house contains, not even afterwards.\"\n\n\"Why do you say if any accident happens to you, Ready?\" said William.\n\n\"Because, William, if they place the faggots so as to be able to walk to\nthe top of the palisades, I may be wounded or killed, and so may you.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied William; \"but they are not in yet, and they shall\nhave a hard fight for it.\"\n\nReady then told Mr Seagrave that he would keep the watch, and call him\nat twelve o'clock.  During these two days, they had eaten very little; a\nturtle had been killed, and pieces fried, but eating only added to their\nthirst, and even the children refused the meat.  The sufferings were now\nreally dreadful, and poor Mrs Seagrave was almost frantic.\n\nAs soon as Mr Seagrave had gone into the house, Ready called William,\nand said, \"William, water we must have.  I cannot bear to see the agony\nof the poor children, and the state of mind which your poor mother is\nin; and more, without water we never shall be able to beat off the\nsavages to-morrow.  We shall literally die of choking in the smoke, if\nthey use fire.  Now, William, I intend to take one of the seven-gallon\nbarricos, and go down to the well for water.  I may succeed, and I may\nnot, but attempt it I must, and if I fall it cannot be helped.\"\n\n\"Why not let me go, Ready?\" replied William.\n\n\"For many reasons, William,\" said Ready; \"and the chief one is that I do\nnot think you would succeed so well as I shall.  I shall put on the\nwar-cloak and feathers of the savage who fell dead inside of the\nstockade, and that will be a disguise, but I shall take no arms except\nhis spear, as they would only be in my way, and increase the weight I\nhave to carry.  Now observe, you must let me out of the door, and when I\nam out, in case of accident put one of the poles across it inside; that\nwill keep the door fast, if they attack it, until you can secure it with\nthe others.  Watch my return, and be all ready to let me in.  Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly, Ready; but I am now, I must confess, really frightened;\nif anything was to happen to you, what a misery it would be!\"\n\n\"There is no help for it, William.  Water must, if possible, be\nprocured, and now is a better time to make the attempt than later, when\nthey may be more on the watch; they have left off their work, and are\nbusy eating; if I meet any one, it will only be a woman.\"\n\nReady went for the barrico, a little cask, which held six or seven\ngallons of water.  He put on the head-dress and war-cloak of the savage;\nand, taking the barrico on his shoulder, and the spear in his hand, the\npoles which barred the door were softly removed by William, and after\nascertaining that no one was concealed beneath the palisades, Ready\npressed William's hand, and set off across the cleared space outside of\nthe stockade, and gained the cocoa-nut trees.  William, as directed,\nclosed the door, passed one pole through the inner door-posts for\nsecurity, and remained on the watch.  He was in an awful state of\nsuspense, listening to the slightest noise, even the slight rustling by\nthe wind of the cocoa-nut boughs above him made him start; there he\ncontinued for some minutes, his gun ready cocked by his side.\n\nIt is time that he returned, thought William; the distance is not 100\nyards, and yet I have heard no noise.  At last he thought he heard\nfootsteps coming very softly.  Yes, it was so.  Ready was returning, and\nwithout any accident.  William had his hand upon the pole, to slip it on\none side and open the door, when he heard a scuffle and a fall close to\nthe door.  He immediately threw down the pole, and opened it just as\nReady called him by name.  William seized his musket and sprang out; he\nfound Ready struggling with a savage, who was uppermost, and with his\nspear at Ready's breast.  In a second William levelled and fired, and\nthe savage fell dead.\n\n\"Take the water in quick, William,\" said Ready in a faint voice.  \"I\nwill contrive to crawl in if I can.\"\n\nWilliam caught up the barrico of water, and took it in; he then hastened\nto Ready, who was on his knees.  Mr Seagrave, hearing the musket fired,\nhad run out, and finding the stockade door open, followed William, and\nseeing him endeavouring to support Ready, caught hold of his other arm,\nand they led him tottering into the stockade; the door was then\nimmediately secured, and they went to his assistance.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Ready?\" said William.\n\n\"Yes, dear boy, yes; hurt to death, I fear: his spear went through my\nbreast.  Water, quick, water!\"\n\n\"Alas! that we had some,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\n\"We have, papa,\" replied William; \"but it has cost us dearly.\"\n\nWilliam ran for a pannikin, and taking out the bung, poured some water\nout of the barrico and gave it to Ready, who drank it with eagerness.\n\n\"Now, William, lay me down on these cocoa-nut boughs; go and give some\nwater to the others, and when you have all drunk, then come to me again.\nDon't tell Mrs Seagrave that I'm hurt.  Do as I beg of you.\"\n\n\"Papa, take the water--do pray,\" replied William; \"I cannot leave\nReady.\"\n\n\"I will, my boy,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"but first drink yourself.\"\n\nWilliam, who was very faint, drank off the pannikin of water, which\nimmediately revived him, and then, while Mr Seagrave hastened with some\nwater to the children and women, occupied himself with old Ready, who\nbreathed heavily, but did not speak.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 65.\n\nAfter returning twice for water, to satisfy those in the house, Mr\nSeagrave came to the assistance of William, who had been removing\nReady's clothes to ascertain the nature of the wound he had received.\n\n\"We had better move him to where the other cocoa-nut boughs lie; he will\nbe more comfortable there,\" said William.\n\nReady whispered, \"More water.\"  William gave him some more and then,\nwith the assistance of his father, Ready was removed to a more\ncomfortable place.  As soon as they laid him there, Ready turned on his\nside, and threw up a quantity of blood.\n\n\"I am better now,\" said he in a low voice; \"bind up the wound, William;\nan old man like me has not much blood to spare.\"\n\nMr Seagrave and William then examined the wound; the spear had gone\ndeep into the lungs.  William threw off his shirt, tore it up into\nstrips, and then bound up the wound so as to stop the effusion of blood.\n\nReady, who at first appeared much exhausted with being moved about,\ngradually recovered so as to be able to speak in a low voice, when Mrs\nSeagrave came out of the house.\n\n\"Where is that brave, kind man?\" cried she, \"that I may bless him and\nthank him.\"\n\nMr Seagrave went to her, and caught her by the arm.  \"He is hurt, my\ndear; and very much hurt.  I did not tell you at the time.\"\n\nMr Seagrave related what had occurred, and then led her to where Ready\nwas lying.  Mrs Seagrave knelt by his side, took his hand, and burst\ninto tears.\n\n\"Don't weep for me,\" said Ready; \"my days have been numbered; I'm only\nsorry that I cannot any more be useful to you.\"\n\n\"Dear good man,\" said Mrs Seagrave, \"whatever may be our fates, and\nthat is for the Almighty to decide for us, as long as I have life, what\nyou have done for me and mine shall never be forgotten.\"\n\nMrs Seagrave then bent over him, and kissing his forehead, rose and\nretired weeping into the house.\n\n\"William,\" said Ready, \"I can't talk now; raise my head a little, and\nthen leave me.  You have not looked round lately.  Come again in about\nhalf an hour.  Leave me now, Mr Seagrave; I shall be better if I doze a\nlittle.\"\n\nThey complied with Ready's request; went up to the planks, and examined\ncarefully all round the stockade; at last they stopped.\n\n\"This is a sad business, William,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n\nWilliam shook his head.  \"He would not let me go,\" replied he; \"I wish\nhe had.  I fear that he is much hurt.\"\n\n\"I should say that he cannot recover, William.  We shall miss him\nto-morrow if they attack us.\"\n\n\"I hardly know what to say, papa; but I feel that since we have been\nrelieved, I am able to do twice as much as I could have done before.\"\n\n\"I feel the same, but still with such a force against us, two people\ncannot do much.\"\n\n\"If my mother and Juno load the muskets for us,\" replied William, \"we\nshall at all events do as much now as we should have been able to do if\nthere were three, so exhausted as we should have been.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so; at all events we will do our best, for we fight for our\nlives and for those most dear to us.\"\n\nWilliam went softly up to Ready, and found that he was dozing; he\ntherefore did not disturb him, but returned to his father.  Now that\ntheir thirst had been appeased, they all felt the calls of hunger.  Juno\nand William went and cut off steaks from the turtle, and fried them;\nthey all made a hearty meal, and perhaps never had they taken one with\nso much relish in their lives.\n\nIt was nearly daylight, when William, who had several times been softly\nup to Ready, found him with his eyes open.\n\n\"How do you find yourself, Ready?\" said William.\n\n\"I am quiet and easy, William, and without much pain; but I think I am\nsinking, and shall not last long.  Recollect that if you are obliged to\nescape from the stockade, you take no heed of me, but leave me where I\nam.  I cannot live, and were you to move me, I should only die the\nsooner.\"\n\n\"I had rather die with you, than leave you, Ready.\"\n\n\"No, that is wrong; you must save your mother, and your brothers and\nsister; promise me that you will do as I wish.\"\n\nWilliam hesitated.\n\n\"I point out to you your duty, William.  I know what your feelings are,\nbut you must not give way to them; promise me this, or you will make me\nvery miserable.\"\n\nWilliam squeezed Ready's hand; his heart was too full to speak.\n\n\"They will come at daylight, William; you have not much time to spare;\nclimb to the look-out, and wait there till day dawns; watch them as long\nas you can, and then come and tell me what you have seen.\"\n\nReady's voice became faint after this exertion of speaking so much.\n\nWilliam immediately climbed up the cocoa-nut tree, and waited there till\ndaylight.  At the dawn of day, he perceived that the savages were at\nwork, that they had collected all the faggots together opposite to where\nthe old house had stood, and were very busy in making arrangements for\nthe attack.  At last, every one shouldered a faggot, and commenced their\nadvance towards the stockade; William immediately descended and called\nhis father, who was talking with Mrs Seagrave.  The muskets were all\nloaded, and Mrs Seagrave and Juno took their posts below the planking,\nto reload them as fast as they were fired.\n\n\"We must fire upon them as soon as we are sure of not missing, William,\"\nsaid Mr Seagrave, \"for the more we check their advance, the better.\"\n\nWhen the first savages were within fifty yards, they both fired, and two\nof the men dropped; they continued to fire as their assailants came up,\nwith great success for the first ten minutes; after which the savages\nadvanced in a larger body, and took the precaution to hold the faggots\nin front of them, for some protection as they approached.  By these\nmeans they gained the stockade in safety, and commenced laying their\nfaggots.  Mr Seagrave and William still kept up an incessant fire upon\nthem, but not with so much success as before.\n\nAlthough many fell, the faggots were gradually heaped up, till they\nalmost reached to the holes between the palisades, through which they\npointed their muskets; and as the savages contrived to slope them down\nfrom the stockade to the ground, it was evident that they meant to mount\nup and take them by escalade.  At last, it appeared as if all the\nfaggots had been placed, and the savages retired farther back, to where\nthe cocoa-nut trees were still standing.\n\n\"They have gone away, father,\" said William; \"but they will come again,\nand I fear it is all over with us.\"\n\n\"I fear so too, my boy,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"they are only retreating\nto arrange for a general assault, and they now will be able to gain an\nentrance.  I almost wish that they had fired the faggots; we might have\nescaped as Ready pointed out to us, but now I fear we have no chance.\"\n\n\"Don't say a word to my mother,\" said William; \"let us defend ourselves\nto the last, and if we are overpowered it is the will of God.\"\n\n\"I should like to take a farewell embrace of your dear mother,\" said Mr\nSeagrave; \"but, no; it will be weakness just now.  Here they come,\nWilliam, in a swarm.  Well, God bless you, my boy; we shall all, I\ntrust, meet in Heaven!\"\n\nThe whole body of savages were now advancing from the cocoa-nut wood in\na solid mass; they raised a yell, which struck terror into the hearts of\nMrs Seagrave and Juno, yet they flinched not.  The savages were again\nwithin fifty yards of them, when the fire was opened upon them; the fire\nwas answered by loud yells, and the savages had already reached to the\nbottom of the sloping pile of faggots, when the yells and the reports of\nthe muskets were drowned by a much louder report, followed by the\ncrackling and breaking of the cocoa-nut trees, which made both parties\nstart with surprise; another and another followed, the ground was\nploughed up, and the savages fell in numbers.\n\n\"It must be the cannon of a ship, father,\" said William; \"we are saved--\nwe are saved!\"\n\n\"It can be nothing else; we are saved, and by a miracle!\" replied Mr\nSeagrave in utter astonishment.\n\nThe savages paused in the advance, quite stupefied; again, again, again,\nthe report of the loud guns boomed through the air, and the round-shot\nand grape came whizzing and tearing through the cocoa-nut grove; at this\nlast broadside, the savages turned, and fled towards their canoes: not\none was left to be seen.\n\n\"We are saved!\" cried Mr Seagrave, leaping off the plank and embracing\nhis wife, who sank down on her knees, and held up her clasped hands in\nthankfulness to Heaven.\n\nWilliam had hastened up to the look-out on the cocoa-nut tree, and now\ncried out to them below, as the guns were again discharged:\n\n\"A large schooner, father; she is firing at the savages, who are at the\ncanoes; they are falling in every direction: some have plunged into the\nwater; there is a boat full of armed men coming on shore; they are close\nto the beach, by the garden-point.  Three of the canoes have got off\nfull of men; there go the guns again; two of the canoes are sunk,\nfather; the boat has landed, and the people are coming up this way.\"\nWilliam then descended from the look-out as fast as he could.\n\nAs soon as he was down, he commenced unbarring the door of the stockade.\nHe pulled out the last pole just as he heard the feet of their\ndeliverers outside.  He threw open the door, and, a second after, found\nhimself in the arms of Captain Osborn.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 66.\n\nBefore we wind up this history, it will be as well to state to my young\nreaders how it was that Captain Osborn made his appearance at so\nfortunate a moment.  It will be recollected how a brig came off the\nisland some months before this, and the great disappointment that the\nparty on the island experienced in her not making her appearance again.\nThe fact was, that those on board of the brig had not only seen their\nsignals, but had read the name of the \"_Pacific_\" upon the flag hoisted;\nbut the heavy gale which came on drove them so far to the southward,\nthat the master of the brig did not consider that he should do his duty\nto his owners, if he lost so much time in beating up for the island\nagain.  He therefore decided upon making all sail for Sydney, to which\nport he was bound.\n\nWhen Captain Osborn was put into the boat by Mackintosh and the seamen\nof the _Pacific_, he was still insensible; but he gradually recovered,\nand after a stormy night, Captain Osborn was so far recovered as to hear\nfrom Mackintosh what had taken place, and why it was that he found\nhimself in an open boat at sea.  The next morning the wind moderated,\nand they were fortunate enough to fall in with a vessel bound to Van\nDiemen's Land, which took them all on board.\n\nFrom the account given by Mackintosh, Captain Osborn had no doubt in his\nmind but that the Seagrave family had perished, and the loss of the\nvessel, with them on board, was duly reported to the owners.  When at\nVan Diemen's Land, Captain Osborn was so much taken with the beauty and\nfertility of the country, and perhaps not so well inclined to go to sea\nagain after such danger as he had incurred in the last voyage, that he\nresolved to purchase land and settle there.  He did so, and had already\nstocked his farm with cattle, and had gone round to Sydney in a schooner\nto await the arrival of a large order from England which he had sent\nfor, when the brig arrived and reported the existence of some white\npeople on the small island, and also that they had hoisted a flag with\nthe name _Pacific_ worked on it.\n\nCaptain Osborn, hearing this, went to the master of the brig, and\nquestioned him.  He found the latitude and longitude of the island to be\nnot far from that of the ship when she was deserted, and he was now\nconvinced that, by some miracle, the Seagrave family had been preserved.\nHe therefore went to the Governor of New South Wales, and made him\nacquainted with the facts which had been established, and the Governor\ninstantly replied, that the government armed schooner was at his\nservice, if he would himself go in quest of his former shipmates.\nInconvenient as the absence at that time was to Captain Osborn, he at\nonce acquiesced, and in a few days the schooner sailed for her\ndestination.  She arrived off the island on the same morning that the\nfleet of canoes with the savages effected their landing, and when\nWilliam made the remark to Ready as they were hastening into the\nstockade, that there was another vessel under sail off the garden-point,\nhad Ready had time to put his eye to the telescope, he would have\ndiscovered that it was the schooner.\n\nThe schooner stood in to the reefs, and then hauled off again, that she\nmight send her boat in to sound for an anchorage.  The boat, when\nsounding, perceived the canoes and the savages, and afterwards heard the\nreport of firearms on the first attack.  On her return on board the\nschooner, they stated what they had seen and heard, and their idea that\nthe white people on the island were being attacked by the savages.  As\nthe boat did not return on board till near dusk, they had not time to\ncanvas, the question when the night attack was made, and they again\nheard the firing of the muskets.  This made Captain Osborn most anxious\nto land as soon as possible, but as the savages were in such numbers,\nand the crew of the schooner did not consist of more than twenty-five\nmen, the commander considered it was rash to make the attempt.  He did,\nhowever, show the utmost anxiety to bring his schooner to an anchor, so\nas to protect his men, and then agreed that they should land.\n\nThe boat had reported deep water and good anchorage close to the\ngarden-point, and every preparation was made for running at daylight on\nthe following morning; but unfortunately, it fell calm for the best part\nof the day, and it was not until the morning after, just as the savages\nwere making their last attack upon the stockade, that she could get in.\nAs soon as she did, she opened the fire of her carronades, and the\nresult is already known.\n\nMy readers must, if they can, imagine the joy of Mr and Mrs Seagrave\nwhen they beheld their old friend Captain Osborn.  All danger was now\nover; the party who had landed with him went out under the command of\nthe mate, to ascertain if there were any more of the savages to be\nfound; but, except the dead and dying, all had escaped in some of the\nsmaller canoes.  Captain Osborn remained with the Seagraves, and they\ninformed him of the state of poor old Ready, whom William had gone to\nattend as soon as Captain Osborn was engaged with his father and mother.\nCaptain Osborn hurried out to see him; Ready knew his voice, for his\neyes were already so dim that he could not see.\n\n\"That is Captain Osborn, I know,\" said Ready in a faint voice.  \"You\nhave come in good time, sir; I knew you would come, and I always said\nso: you have the thanks of a dying man.\"\n\n\"I hope it is not so bad as that, Ready; we have a surgeon on board, and\nI will send for him at once.\"\n\n\"No surgeon can help me, sir,\" replied Ready; \"another hour of time will\nnot pass before I shall be in Eternity.\"\n\nThe old man then joined his hands across his breast, and remained for\nsome time in silent prayer.  Then he bade them farewell in a faint\nvoice, which at last was changed to a mere whisper.  They still\nremained, in silence and in tears, standing round him, William only\nkneeling and holding his hand, when the old man's head fell back, and he\nwas no more!\n\n\"It is all over,\" said Mr Seagrave mournfully, \"and he has, I have no\ndoubt, gone to receive the reward of a good and just man.  `Happy are\nthose who die in the Lord.'\"\n\nMr Seagrave then led away his wife and children, leaving Juno and\nWilliam.  William closed his eyes, and Juno went and fetched the ship's\nensign, which they laid over the body, after which they joined the rest\nof the party in the house.\n\nIt was decided that the following day should be passed in packing up and\ngetting on board their luggage, and that the day after the family should\nembark.  William then mentioned the wish of poor old Ready as to his\nburial.  The commander of the schooner immediately gave directions for a\ncoffin to be made, and for his men to dig the grave at the spot that\nWilliam should point out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 67.\n\nThe hurry and bustle of preparing for their departure from the island,\nand the rapid succession of events which had been crowded together\nwithin so very few days, had not allowed time for much thought or\nreflection to Mr and Mrs Seagrave and William; at length, however,\nevery preparation had been made, and they were no longer urged by the\ncommander of the schooner to hasten their packing up and arrangements;\nfor everything had been sent on board during the afternoon, and it was\nproposed that they should sail on the following day.\n\nNow they had time to feel, and bitterly did they lament the loss of\ntheir old friend, and deplore that he had not survived to sail with them\nto Sydney.  They had always indulged the hope that one day they should\nbe taken off the island, and in that hope they had ever looked forward\nto old Ready becoming a part of their future household.  Now that their\nwishes had been granted--so much was the feeling of joy and gratitude\nmingled with regret--that could he have been restored to them, they felt\nas if they would have gladly remained on the island.\n\nCaptain Osborn, the commander, and the crew of the schooner had taken\nleave of them for the night, and had gone on board, having made\narrangements for the interment of Ready, previous to their sailing, on\nthe following day.  The children had been put to bed, and Juno had\nquitted the house; Mr and Mrs Seagrave and William were sitting\ntogether in their now half-dismantled room, when Juno entered; the poor\ngirl had evidently been weeping.\n\n\"Well, Juno,\" observed Mr Seagrave, with a view to break the silence\nwhich had continued for some time previous to her entrance, \"are you not\nglad to leave the island?\"\n\n\"One time I think I would be very glad, but now I not care much,\"\nreplied Juno.  \"Island very nice place, all very happy till savage come.\nSuppose they not kill old Ready, I not care.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Mrs Seagrave, \"it is a sad blow to us all; I did\nhope to have fostered the good old man, and to have been able to have\nshown him our gratitude, but--\"\n\n\"It is the will of Heaven that it should be otherwise,\" continued Mr\nSeagrave; \"I would give half that I am possessed of, that he had not\nperished.\"\n\n\"Oh, Massa!\" said Juno, \"I sit by him just now; I take off the flag and\nlook at his face, so calm, look so happy, so good, I almost tink he\nsmile at me, and then I cry.  Oh!  Massa Tommy, all because you idle\nboy.\"\n\n\"It adds much to my regret,\" replied Mr Seagrave, \"that his life should\nhave been sacrificed through the thoughtlessness of one of my own\nchildren; what a lesson it will be to Tommy when he is old enough to\ncomprehend the consequences of his conduct.\"\n\n\"That he must not know, papa,\" said William, who had been leaning\nmournfully over the table; \"one of Ready's last injunctions was that\nTommy was never to be told of it.\"\n\n\"His last wishes shall be religiously attended to, my dear boy,\" replied\nMr Seagrave; \"for what do we not owe to that good old man?  When others\ndeserted us and left us to perish, he remained with us to share our\nfate.  By his skill we were saved and landed in safety.  He provided for\nour wants, added to our comforts, instructed us how to make the best use\nof our means.  Without his precautions we should have perished by the\nspears of the savages.  What an example of Christian fortitude and\nhumility did he ever show us! and indeed, I may truly say, that by his\nexample, sinful as I must ever be, I have become, I trust, a better man.\nWould that he were now sitting by us,--but the Lord's will be done!\"\n\n\"I feel as if I had lost a stay or prop,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.  \"So\naccustomed have I been to look to him for advice since we have been on\nthis island.  Had he not been thus snatched from us--had he been spared\nto us a few years, and had we been permitted to surround his death-bed,\nand close his eyes in peace--\" and Mrs Seagrave wept upon the shoulder\nof her husband.\n\nAfter a time, Mrs Seagrave recovered herself; but silence ensued, only\nbroken by an occasional sob from poor Juno.  William's heart was too\nfull; he could not for a long while utter a word; at last he said in a\nlow voice:\n\n\"I feel that, next to my dear father and mother, I have lost my best\nfriend.  I cannot forgive myself for allowing him to go for the water;\nit was my duty to go, and I ought to have gone.\"\n\n\"And yet we could have ill spared you, my dear boy; you might have\nperished,\" replied Mrs Seagrave.\n\n\"It would have been as God willed,\" replied William; \"I might have\nperished, or I might not.\"\n\n\"We never know what the morrow may bring forth,\" said Mr Seagrave, \"or\nwhat may be in store for us.  Had not this misfortune happened, had old\nReady been spared to us, how joyfully should I and all of you have\nquitted this island, full of anticipation, and indulging in worldly\nprospects.  What a check have I received!  I now am all thought and\nanxiety.  I have said to myself, `we have been happy on this island; our\nwants have been supplied; even our comforts have been great.  We have\nbeen under no temptations, for we have been isolated from the world; am\nI so sure that I shall be as happy in future as I have been?  Am I\nconfident, now my long-wished-for return to the world is about to take\nplace, that I shall have no cause to lament that I ever quitted this\npeaceful, quiet spot?'  I feel that it is a duty to my family that I\nshould return to society, but I am far from feeling that our happiness\nmay be increased.  We have, however, a plain precept to follow, which\nis, to do our duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to\ncall us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs Seagrave; \"I feel the truth of all you have just\nsaid.  We are in his hands; let us put our trust in him.\"\n\n\"We will,\" replied Mr Seagrave; \"but it is late, and we have to rise\nearly to-morrow morning.  This is the last evening which we shall pass\non this island; let us return our thanks for the happiness we have\nenjoyed here.  We thought to have quitted this spot in joy,--it is his\nwill that we should leave it in sorrow.\"\n\nMr Seagrave took down the Bible, and after he had read a chapter, he\npoured forth a prayer suited to their feelings, and they all retired to\nrepose.\n\nThe next morning they were up early, and packed up the few articles\nwhich still remained to go on board.  Mr Seagrave read the prayers, and\nthey went to breakfast.  Few words were exchanged, for there was a\nsolemn grief upon all of them.  They waited for the arrival of Captain\nOsborn and the crew of the schooner to attend the funeral of poor old\nReady.  William, who had gone out occasionally to look at the vessel,\nnow came in, and said that two boats were pulling on shore.  A few\nminutes afterwards, Captain Osborn and the commander of the schooner\nsoon made their appearance.  The coffin had been brought on shore; the\nbody of Ready was put into it, and it was screwed down.\n\nIn half an hour all was prepared, and the family were summoned from the\nhouse.  The coffin, covered with the Union Jack as a pall, was raised on\nthe shoulders of six of the seamen, and they bore it to the grave,\nfollowed by Mrs Seagrave and the children, the commander of the\nschooner, and several of the men.  Mr Seagrave read the funeral\nservice, the grave was filled up, and they all walked back in silence.\nAt the request of William, the commander of the schooner had ordered the\ncarpenter to prepare an oak paling to put round the grave, and a board\non which was written the name of the deceased and day of his death.  As\nsoon as this had been fixed up, William, with a deep sigh, followed the\ncommander of the schooner to the house to announce that all was\nfinished, and that the boat waited for them to embark.\n\n\"Come, my dear,\" said Mr Seagrave to his wife.\n\n\"I will, I will,\" replied Mrs Seagrave, \"but I don't know how it is,\nnow that the hour is come, I really feel such pain at quitting this dear\nisland.  Had it not been for poor Ready's death, I really do think I\nshould wish to remain.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt but that you feel sorrow, my dear, but we must not keep\nCaptain Osborn waiting.\"\n\nAs Mr Seagrave was aware that the commander of the schooner was anxious\nto get clear of the islands before night, he now led his wife down to\nthe boat.  They all embarked, and were soon on the deck of the schooner,\nfrom whence they continued to fix their eyes upon the island, while the\nmen were heaving up the anchor.  At last sail was made upon the vessel,\nthe garden-point was cleared, and, as they ran away with a fair wind,\neach object on the shore became more indistinct.  Still their eyes were\nturned in that direction.\n\nAs they ran down to the westward, they passed the cove where they had\nfirst landed, and Mr Seagrave directed Mrs Seagrave's attention to it.\nShe remained for some time looking at it in silence, and then said as\nshe turned away:\n\n\"We shall never be more happy than we were on that island, Seagrave.\"\n\n\"It will indeed be well, my dear, if we never are less happy,\" replied\nher husband.\n\nThe schooner now ran fast through the water, and the island was every\nminute less distinct; after a time, the land was below the horizon, and\nthe tops of the cocoa-nut trees only to be seen; these gradually\ndisappeared.  Juno watched on, and when at last nothing could be seen,\nshe waved her handkerchief in the direction of the island, as if to bid\nit farewell, and then went down below to hide her grief.\n\nThe wind continued fair, and, after a favourable passage of little more\nthan four weeks, they arrived at Sydney Cove, the port to which they\nwere bound when they embarked from England on board of the good ship\nPacific.\n\nPS.  As my young readers will probably wish to know a little more about\nthe Seagrave family, I will inform them that Mr Seagrave, like the\npatriarch Job after his tribulation, found his flocks and herds greatly\nincreased on his arrival at Sydney.  Mr and Mrs Seagrave lived to see\nall their children grown up.  William inherited the greater part of the\nproperty from his father, after having for many years assisted him in\nthe management of it.  Tommy, notwithstanding all his scrapes, grew up a\nvery fine fellow, and entered the army.  Caroline married a young\nclergyman, and made him an excellent wife; little Albert went into the\nnavy, and is at present a commander.\n\nJuno is still alive, and lives at Seagrave plantation with William, and\nher greatest pleasure is to take his children on her knee, and tell them\nlong stories about the island, and make them cry when she goes through\nthe history of old Ready's death and burial.\n",
